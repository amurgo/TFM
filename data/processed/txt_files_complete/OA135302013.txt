Representatives
For the Appellant:     Ms Mair, Counsel instructed by Montague Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Harrison, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is agreed to be a national of Ethiopia date of birth [  ]
    1997.  She appeals with permission[1] the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Davies) to dismiss her appeal against the  Respondent's
    decision to refuse to grant her entry clearance. She wishes  to  settle
    in the UK with her maternal aunt, who has  adopted  her  in  accordance
    with Ethiopian law.

 2. The application, made on 7th May 2013, requested  indefinite  leave  to
    enter the UK as the child of a parent, parents, or relative present and
    settled in the UK under paragraph 297 of  the  Immigration  Rules.  The
    application was refused on the 21st May 2013. The  Respondent  was  not
    satisfied that the Appellant was related as claimed to her Sponsor, nor
    that she had been adopted by her in accordance with Ethiopian law.  The
    Appellant had claimed that her parents had both died in 2000,  and  had
    provided death certificates issued in 2009 as  evidence  of  this;  the
    Respondent was not prepared to attach any weight to these certificates.
     The evidence going to contact between the Appellant  and  her  Sponsor
    did not establish that there was any relationship of dependency between
    them. Entry clearance was refused and the  Appellant  appealed  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal.

    The Decision of the First-tier Tribunal

 3. When the matter came before Judge Davies he agreed that  the  Appellant
    could, in addition to advancing her case under  paragraph  297  of  the
    Rules, rely upon paragraph 310 and Article 8 ECHR.

 4. Paragraph 310 reads:

         '310. The requirements to be met in the case  of  a  child  seeking
         indefinite leave to enter the United Kingdom as the  adopted  child
         of a parent or parents present and settled or  being  admitted  for
         settlement in the United Kingdom are that he:

         (i)      is seeking leave to enter to accompany or join an adoptive
         parent or parents in one of the following circumstances;

             (a) both  parents  are  present  and  settled  in  the  United
             Kingdom; or

             (b) both parents are being admitted on the same  occasion  for
             settlement; or

             (c) one parent is present and settled in  the  United  Kingdom
             and the other is being  admitted  on  the  same  occasion  for
             settlement; or

             (d) one parent is present and settled in the United Kingdom or
             being admitted on the same occasion  for  settlement  and  the
             other parent is dead; or

             (e) one parent is present and settled in the United Kingdom or
             being admitted on the same occasion for settlement and has had
             sole responsibility for the child's upbringing; or

             (f) one parent is present and settled in the United Kingdom or
             being admitted on the same occasion for settlement  and  there
             are serious and  compelling  family  or  other  considerations
             which make exclusion of the  child  undesirable  and  suitable
             arrangements have been made for the child's care; or

             (g) in the case of a de facto adoption one parent has a  right
             of abode in the United Kingdom or indefinite leave to enter or
             remain in the United Kingdom and is seeking admission  to  the
             United Kingdom on  the  same  occasion  for  the  purposes  of
             settlement; and

         (ii)     is under the age of 18; and

         (iii)    is not leading an independent life, is  unmarried  and  is
         not a civil partner, and has not formed an independent family unit;
         and

         (iv)     can, and will, be accommodated and  maintained  adequately
         without  recourse  to  public  funds  in  accommodation  which  the
         adoptive parent or parents own or occupy exclusively; and

         (v)      DELETED

         (vi)     (a)  was adopted in accordance with a  decision  taken  by
         the competent administrative authority or court in his  country  of
         origin or the country in which he  is  resident,  being  a  country
         whose adoption orders are recognised by the United Kingdom; or

            (b)   is the subject of a de facto adoption; and

         (vii)    was adopted at a time when:

             (a) both adoptive parents were resident together abroad; or

             (b) either or both adoptive parents were settled in the United
             Kingdom; and

         (viii)   has the same rights and obligations as any other child  of
         the adoptive parent's or parents' family; and

         (ix)     was adopted due to the inability of the original parent(s)
         or current carer(s) to care for him and there has  been  a  genuine
         transfer of parental responsibility to the adoptive parents; and

         (x) has lost or broken his ties with his family of origin; and

         (xi)     was adopted, but the adoption is not  one  of  convenience
         arranged to facilitate his admission to or remaining in the  United
         Kingdom; and

         (xii)    holds a valid United Kingdom entry clearance for entry  in
         this capacity; and

         (xiii)   does not fall for refusal under the  general  grounds  for
         refusal.'

    The First-tier Tribunal was not satisfied that the Appellant could meet
    these  requirements.  At  paragraph  33  of  the  determination  it  is
    correctly noted that Ethiopia is not a party to the  Hague  Convention,
    and that its adoption procedures are not recognised as valid in England
    and Wales.

 5. The relevant parts of paragraph 297 read:

         '297. The requirements to be met by  a  person  seeking  indefinite
         leave to enter the United Kingdom as the child of a parent, parents
         or a relative present and settled or being admitted for  settlement
         in the United Kingdom are that he:

         (i)      is seeking leave to enter to accompany or join  a  parent,
         parents or a relative in one of the following circumstances:

             ...

             (f) one parent or a relative is present  and  settled  in  the
             United Kingdom or being admitted  on  the  same  occasion  for
             settlement and there are  serious  and  compelling  family  or
             other  considerations  which  make  exclusion  of  the   child
             undesirable and suitable arrangements have been made  for  the
             child's care; and

         (ii)     is under the age of 18; and

         (iii)    is not leading an independent life, is  unmarried  and  is
         not a civil partner, and has not formed an independent family unit;
         and

         (iv)     can, and will, be accommodated adequately by  the  parent,
         parents or relative the child is seeking to join  without  recourse
         to public funds in  accommodation  which  the  parent,  parents  or
         relative the child is seeking to join, own or  occupy  exclusively;
         and

         (v)      can, and will, be maintained  adequately  by  the  parent,
         parents, or relative the child is seeking to join, without recourse
         to public funds; and

         (vi)     holds a valid United Kingdom entry clearance for entry  in
         this capacity; and

         (vii)    does not fall for refusal under the  general  grounds  for
         refusal.'

    In respect of this provision the First-tier  Tribunal  found  that  the
    Appellant is related as claimed to her  sponsor,  DNA  evidence  having
    been obtained.   It appears to be accepted that the  Sponsor  has  been
    financially supporting the Appellant in Ethiopia and that she has  made
    decisions regarding  her  upbringing.  As  to  whether  there  are  any
    "serious and compelling family or other considerations which  make  her
    exclusion undesirable" the determination finds there to be  a  lack  of
    evidence. The evidence about the "old and infirm" guardians  with  whom
    the Appellant presently lives was rejected as discrepant. The  Tribunal
    finds that one of those guardians has income from a business  and  that
    the family are in fact living in comfortable circumstances. The  appeal
    is then dismissed, with no reference to Article 8.

    Error of Law

 6. The Appellant was granted permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal on
    the following grounds:

          i) The determination fails to address Article 8 ECHR;

         ii) There is no consideration given to the best interests  of  the
             child appellant;

        iii)  The  Tribunal  erred  in  its  approach  to  paragraph   310,
             specifically in respect  of  whether  the  Ethiopian  adoption
             constituted a "decision taken by  a  competent  authority",  a
             test not defined  with  reference  to  the  Hague  Convention.
             Reliance  is  placed  on  Buama  (inter-country   adoption   -
             competent court) [2012] UKUT 00146 (IAC);

         iv) The Tribunal erred in its approach to the  test  in  paragraph
             297(i)(f). It  appeared  to  conclude  that  there  cannot  be
             "serious  and  compelling  family  or  other   considerations"
             because the Appellant has unrelated guardians in Ethiopia.  In
             making that finding  the  Tribunal  failed  to  give  adequate
             reasons  and  failed  to   take  account  of  the  Respondents
             published policy in the form of the Immigration  Directorates'
             Instruction ("the IDI")

          v) Failure to give reasons for the finding that the evidence "did
             not support"  the  contention  that  the  Appellant's  present
             guardians are unable to care for her; reasons should have been
             given for this conclusion, particularly  where  the  Sponsors'
             credibility had not been challenged at the hearing.

 7. The matter was first listed on the  9th  December  2014  when  it  came
    before Judge Bruce, sitting as a Deputy of the Upper Tribunal.  At that
    hearing Mr Harrison for the Respondent accepted that there was an error
    of law in the determination in that there were no findings  at  all  on
    Article 8 or the best interests of the Appellant. He accepted Ms Mair's
    contention  that  although  s55  of  the   Borders,   Citizenship   and
    Immigration  Act  2009  extended  no  statutory  obligation  to   Entry
    Clearance Officers the  obligation  to  consider  the  child's  welfare
    nevertheless existed pursuant to Article 3 of  the  Convention  on  the
    Rights of the Child and Strasbourg jurisprudence: T (s55  BCIA  2009  -
    entry clearance) Jamaica [2011] UKUT 00483 (IAC).

 8. Mr Harrison further accepted that in addressing paragraph 297(i)(f)  of
    the Rules the Tribunal had not given adequate reasons for its findings;
    nor had the extensive submissions based  on  the  IDI  been  addressed.
    These, in summary, were that the IDI  suggests  that  where  the  child
    applicant has in her country  of  residence  another  relative  looking
    after her the high threshold in (i)(f) is unlikely to be met.  In  this
    case the guardians with whom she was living  were  entirely  unrelated;
    the IDI suggests that in such circumstances entry  clearance  could  be
    granted. The Respondent further accepted that there was a good deal  of
    evidence which is not addressed in the determination.

 9. For those reasons and to that extent the determination was set aside by
    Judge Bruce. Grounds (i), (ii), (iv) and (v) were accepted to have been
    made out.

10. In respect of ground (iii) Ms Mair relied on  the  decision  in  Buama.
    In that case an order by a Ghanaian Magistrate had been rejected as not
    in accordance with Ghanaian law by the First-tier Tribunal.  On  appeal
    the Upper Tribunal (Judge Warr) held that in  the  absence  of  a  good
    reason to so find, the Order of a Ghanaian court should be presumed  to
    be in accordance  with  Ghanaian  law.  He  held  that  the  court  had
    constituted a  "competent  court"  and  the  appeal  was  allowed  with
    reference to paragraph 310 of the Rules. Ms Mair relied  upon  evidence
    that in February 2011 the Federal First Instance Court of Ethiopia  had
    approved an 'adoption contract' drawn up in respect of  the  Appellant.
    She submitted that paragraph 310 of the Rules made no reference to  the
    Hague Convention and that the First-tier Tribunal had  therefore  erred
    in treating the fact that Ethiopia is not a party to that agreement  as
    determinative.

11. Judge Bruce did not find any merit in  that  submission.  Ms  Mair  was
    correct to say that the recognition of  an  overseas  adoption  is  not
    contingent upon the country  in  question  being  party  to  the  Hague
    Convention.   That does not however mean that an  adoption  order  from
    any court in the world is recognised as valid for the  purpose  of  the
    Immigration Rules,  or  indeed  the  applicable  UK  law  and  practice
    relating  to  overseas  adoptions,  see  for  instance   the   Adoption
    (Recognition  of  Overseas  Adoptions)  Order  2013  ("the   Order")the
    Adoption and Children Act 2002 ("the Act") and  The  Adoptions  with  a
    Foreign Element Regulations 2005 ("the Regulations"). Ethiopia does not
    appear in the schedule of countries set out in the Order;  nor  in  its
    predecessor The Adoption  (Designation  of  Overseas  Adoptions)  Order
    1973. The Act, read in conjunction with the Regulations, sets out clear
    procedures that must be complied with before an overseas  adoption  can
    be recognised.   These include, for instance, the requirement to  apply
    to an adoption agency for assessment of his, her or  their  suitability
    to adopt, and obtaining from the Secretary of State a  'Certificate  of
    Eligibility to Adopt' confirming that a positive  assessment  has  been
    made. Buama does not address any of these issues;  it  was  limited  to
    consideration of the approach that the First-tier Tribunal took to  the
    court order.  As such it is not  authority  for  the  proposition  that
    approval of adoption by any foreign court is  sufficient  to  meet  the
    requirements  in  paragraph  310.  Since  Ethiopia  is  not  a  country
    recognised in the Order, and  that  the  Sponsors  in  this  case  have
    complied with none of the requirements in the Act and Regulations,   it
    follows that the decision of the Ethiopian court is  not  a  sufficient
    basis to conclude that the requirements of paragraph 310 (vi) are  met.
    Ground (iii) was not made out.

    Adjournment of Proceedings

12. Given Judge Bruce's indication in respect of  paragraph  310,  and  the
    possible ramifications it could have for the case under  297(i)(f)  and
    Article 8, the matter was adjourned to enable the Appellant (or  rather
    her  Sponsors)  to  contact  the  relevant  authorities  to  enable  an
    assessment of their suitability as prospective adopters to take place.

13. On the 18th May 2015 the matter came back before Judge Bruce.  Ms  Mair
    explained that those instructing  her  had  contacted  Manchester  City
    Council with a view to arranging an assessment.   They were referred to
    Nugent Care Adoption  Service,  a  registered  and  approved  voluntary
    adoption  agency.   They  also  spoke  with  a  representative  of   an
    alternative agency, Adoption Matters.  Both  informed  the  Appellant's
    solicitors that a full assessment would take 6 months and cost  between
    �7,000 and �10,000.  For  the  Sponsors,  this  was  "not  feasible  or
    viable".   Consideration had been given to the idea of obtaining a less
    expensive, and quicker, report from an independent social  worker;  the
    Tribunal indicated that if this were to consist of  a  report  prepared
    after very limited contact with  the  family  this  would  be  of  very
    limited value.    The  matter  would  therefore  proceed  to  re-making
    without any assessment of the Sponsors.

14. The decision in respect of paragraph 297(1)(f) and Article  8  was  re-
    made by this Tribunal following a hearing on  the  11th  December  2015
    when both Sponsors gave oral evidence.

    The Evidence

    GT

15. GT is the Appellant's maternal aunt.  Her  evidence,  set  out  in  her
    statements[2] and oral evidence, is as follows.

16. GT was born in Asmara in 1966.   She had one brother and one sister.

17. On the 25th September 1997 GT's sister gave birth to the Appellant.  In
    her  witness  statement  GT  states  that  she  left  Eritrea   shortly
    thereafter and came to the United Kingdom to claim asylum.  Her sister,
    brother-in-law and the Appellant went to live in Ethiopia.  In her oral
    evidence GT stated that in fact the Appellant was born  after  she  had
    left for the UK.

18. On the 12th May 2000 the Appellant's father died.   He was an alcoholic
    who died of liver failure.  In  the  weeks  following  his  death  GT's
    sister complained of feeling unwell; as a  person  of  Eritrean  origin
    living in Ethiopia she was unable to receive medical treatment  and  on
    the 28th May 2000 she also died.

19. GT states that when she was contacted and told about her sister's death
    she immediately undertook responsibility for the  Appellant.  She  made
    arrangements for her to live with GAG and his wife  WGG,  described  as
    "family friends on the Appellant's father's side of the family".   They
    agreed to care for her as long as GT paid and took  responsibility  for
    any major decisions. GT  provided  for  the  Appellant  financially  by
    transferring money and sending money and gifts  with  friends  visiting
    Ethiopia.   GT took decisions regarding her medical care,  for  example
    by asking her  carers  to  arrange  visits  to  the  dentist.   As  the
    Appellant grew older GT kept in touch with her  by  telephone  and  now
    speaks with her on  a  regular  basis.   This  has  included  providing
    tutoring to her over the phone.  GT has paid for her education.

20. GT states that she endeavoured to regularise her status in  the  UK  as
    soon as possible so that she could bring  the  Appellant  to  join  her
    here. GT was granted indefinite leave to remain on the 29th June  2005.
    At some point after this she was granted British citizenship.

21. In 2007 GT travelled to Sudan in order to get married to HZ.

22. On the 30th September 2009  GT  travelled  to  Ethiopia  to  visit  the
    Appellant.  She  describes  this  meeting  as  "emotional".  She  began
    proceedings to formally adopt her in  accordance  with  Ethiopian  law.
    She set about trying to obtain official confirmation of the  deaths  of
    the Appellant's parents.

23. GT states that she has been unable to have children  herself  and  that
    this has only increased her wish to have the Appellant  here  with  her
    and her husband.

24. In respect of the possibility of adopting the Appellant  in  accordance
    with UK law GT recognises that certain checks  need  to  be  made.  She
    points out that both she and her husband work in the NHS and that  they
    are therefore subject to annual criminal record checks. They  are  both
    in full time employment and have plenty of room in their two  bedroomed
    property. She has  already  gone  through  the  assessment  process  in
    Ethiopia and found it to be "very expensive and  mentally  exhausting".
    GT also understands that people looking  to  be  approved  as  adoptive
    parents are expected to attend preparation classes. Since she has acted
    as the Appellant's parent since the girl was two years old she does not
    consider that she would benefit from such classes.  Similarly she  does
    not believe that she needs to  discuss  her  parenting  skills  with  a
    social worker during a 'homestudy' visit.  She has  always  viewed  the
    Appellant as her own child and therefore  does  not  need  any  further
    preparation to be a parent. She states that she and  her  husband  have
    "supported her and cared for her as our own".  She does  not  therefore
    wish to undertake the assessment process in  the  UK  because  it  will
    result in further delay, cost between �7000 and �10,000 and even  after
    that would not guarantee the Appellant would gain entry.

25. In her most recent statement GT claims that the  "elderly"  couple  who
    are caring for the Appellant are increasingly unwell.   The  gentleman,
    GAG, is suffering from oedema which was caused by heart failure. He has
    not been able to get treatment in Ethiopia and plans to travel  to  the
    USA to receive this. He would have travelled before but did not wish to
    leave the Appellant alone in Ethiopia. He and his wife do not have  the
    same emotional bond with the Appellant who has always looked to  GT  as
    her mother.  In her oral evidence GT stated  that  GAG  has  previously
    travelled to Italy and Indonesia to receive medical treatment.  At this
    time the Appellant had been left staying with neighbours. This prompted
    Mr Harrison to enquire as to the carers' financial situation. GT stated
    that she did not know anything about that. She did  not  know  if  they
    owned their own home. They had previously had a corner shop but it  was
    now closed down. She was not sure if they had children  of  their  own,
    perhaps one or two, but they are adults now and do not live with  them.
    She does not know  how  GAG  funded  medical  treatment  in  Italy  and
    Indonesia nor how he intends to fund such care in the USA.  At  present
    GT sends between �1000 and �2000 per year for the Appellant's upkeep.

    HZ

26. We heard oral evidence from GT's husband HZ who began by  adopting  his
    witness statements[3].

27. HZ states that he was in a relationship with GT prior to their marriage
    in Sudan in 2007. They had known each other in  Eritrea.  He  therefore
    knew of the background, about her having lost her sister and  taken  on
    care of the Appellant, before he married her.   He and GT had discussed
    on many occasions  the  Appellant's  welfare  and  the  possibility  of
    adopting her. The Appellant enjoys a really good relationship  with  GT
    who treated her like her own child.  Since their marriage  in  2007  he
    has also treated GT like his daughter. He states that she  brings  them
    both joy.  Their commitment to her is  evidenced  by  the  considerable
    amount of time and money that they have spent adopting her in  Ethiopia
    and trying to secure her entry to the UK.  HZ  is  looking  forward  to
    being a proper father and looking after her in the UK.

28. HZ states that the length of time that this process has taken  has  had
    detrimental effects on the Appellant's education. She  has  always  got
    good grades but the past year she has slipped and he believes that this
    is because of the stress of this process and the uncertainty about  her
    future.

29. In response to questions from Mr Harrison  HZ  confirmed  that  he  has
    never met the Appellant in person but that he has spent a lot  of  time
    talking to her on the phone and using social media applications.  Asked
    why his wife had not been to see the Appellant before 2009 he said that
    she had been sorting  out  her  status.  She  had  prioritised  him  in
    organising the trip to Sudan and their marriage.

    Documentary Evidence

30. At the outset of the proceedings  before  us  Mr  Harrison  agreed  the
    following facts: it is now accepted that GT is in fact  the  biological
    aunt of the Appellant, and that she has been financially supporting her
    for a number of years (although the extent of that  support  cannot  be
    quantified  with  reference  to  the   documentary   evidence).     The
    Respondent further accepts that the Appellant is currently living  with
    GAG and his wife, and that GT has adopted the Appellant  in  accordance
    with Ethiopian law.  In his closing  submissions  Mr  Harrison  further
    accepted that the Sponsors have some  contact  with  the  Appellant  by
    telephone and via social media, and that GT visited her in Ethiopia  in
    2009. It is not therefore necessary for us to set out in detail all  of
    the documentary evidence relating to these matters.

31. The  Respondent's  bundle  contains  what  purports  to  be  the  death
    certificate of the Appellant's father. It was issued on the 7th October
    2009 and states that he died on the 12th May  2000  of  an  unspecified
    "sickness". On appeal the Appellant has produced a  letter  from  a  Mr
    Tsegaye, Chairman of  the  Parish  Council  in  the  Ethiopia  Orthodox
    Tewahdo Church. Mr Tsegaye confirms that  the  Appellant's  father  was
    buried at that church on the  the  12th  May  2000.   The  Respondent's
    bundle also contains a death certificate relating  to  the  Appellant's
    mother, issued on the same date. This states that she died on the  28th
    May 2000 in Addis Ababa.  A letter from Mr Tsegaye  confirms  that  her
    burial took place on the same day  at  the  Ethiopia  Orthodox  Tewahdo
    Church.  The most recent bundle contains photographs  of  grave  stones
    identified as belonging to the Appellant's parents.

32. The Appellant relies on a  letter  dated  9th  May  2014  from  Ephream
    Geletaw, who states that he  is  the  Principal  of  Addis  Ababa  City
    Government Agazian No 2 Primary School. Mr Geletaw  confirms  that  the
    Appellant's school fees are paid by the Sponsors in  the  UK  and  that
    they have "followed up her educational status to make sure that she  in
    the good and safe side".

33. The Appellant has produced an original 'statement of consent' signed by
    WGG and dated  24th  May  2014,  along  with  a  certified  translation
    thereof.   She states  that  although  she  has  formed  a  very  close
    relationship with the  Appellant,  the  Appellant  prefers  to  discuss
    personal matters with GT. She gives the example of when  the  Appellant
    was suffering from acne she spoke with GT about how best to  deal  with
    this.  The statement is  accompanied  by  a  copy  of  WGG's  passport,
    showing her to have been born in 1953.   The Appellant  further  relies
    on a statement dated 24th May 2015 from GAG. He states that  since  the
    death of  the  Appellant's  parents  he  has  been  providing  all  the
    necessary care required for her.  Although he and  his  wife  care  for
    her, they turn to GT to make important decisions about the  Appellant's
    life.  GAG has witnessed the Appellant on the phone to GT  and  HZ  and
    can see for himself how happy she is talking to  them.  He  knows  that
    they are in a good position to give the  Appellant  the  very  best  of
    care.  He  states  that  now  his  health  and  that  of  his  wife  is
    deteriorating they are no longer  in  a  position  to  look  after  the
    Appellant and so consent to her going to live with her aunt in the  UK.
    The appended copy Ethiopian passport shows GAG to  have  been  born  in
    1942.

34. In respect of the assertion that GAG and WGG are now too  ill  to  look
    after the Appellant we were referred to two brief  handwritten  medical
    certificates in the Appellant's bundle, both dated 17th March  2006  in
    the Ethiopian calendar; this date was converted to September 2013. Geta
    Higher Medical Service state that GAG is  suffering  from  hypertension
    and "type II DM" as well as IHD. We understood the latter to  refer  to
    diabetes and heart disease.  WGG is described as a "well known case  of
    chronic rheumatoid arthritis".  A subsequent certificate issued by  the
    same clinic is dated 28 April 2015. It states that WGG has attended the
    clinic suffering from Type II diabetes and IHD.

    Our Findings

35. We remind ourselves that in respect of the Rules the  burden  of  proof
    lies on the Appellant, and the standard of  proof  is  the  balance  of
    probabilities. In respect of Article 8  it  is  for  the  Appellant  to
    establish all matters of fact that she  relies  upon.  She  must  first
    establish that she shares a family life with her Sponsors in the UK and
    that the decision to refuse her entry clearance to join them amounts to
    a failure of the state's positive obligations to respect  that  Article
    8(1) right. If Article 8 is shown thereby to be engaged it will be  for
    the Respondent to show that the decision is lawful and proportionate to
    the legitimate aim pursued,  accepted  to  be  the  protection  of  the
    economy.

    Paragraph 297

36. We find that at the date of decision the Appellant was under the age of
    18, was not leading an independent life and that her relatives  in  the
    UK are able to adequately maintain and accommodate her.   The issue  of
    contention arising under paragraph 297  is  whether  the  Appellant  is
    seeking to join GT and that [at (i)(f)]:

         "...  there  are   serious   and   compelling   family   or   other
         considerations which make exclusion of the  child  undesirable  and
         suitable arrangements have been made for the child's care"

37. In this case this test involves two related, but distinct, assessments.
    It must be shown that "suitable arrangements have  been  made  for  the
    child's care", and this is a matter to which we return below, but first
    consideration must be given to the  circumstances  that  the  Appellant
    faces at home in Ethiopia.

38. The phrase "serious and compelling" has been held  to  reflect  a  high
    test in which all relevant factors must be considered: see for instance
    TM (Jamaica) v SSHD [2007] EWCA Civ 178. It  may  involve  dire  socio-
    economic conditions, a lack of security or some  personal  trauma,  but
    not necessarily so. Ms Mair directs our attention to the  relevant  IDI
    (Chapter 8, Section  5A,  Annex  M  'Children').   This  directs  Entry
    Clearance Officers to have regard, in making  the  assessment,  to  the
    government's obligations under s55  of  the  Borders,  Citizenship  and
    Immigration Act 2009.  It states that the objective of the provision in
    297(1)(f) is to allow a child to enter the UK  only  where  that  child
    cannot be adequately cared for by her parents or relatives in  her  own
    country [emphasis added].

39. Looking at the  broad  circumstances  of  the  Appellant  we  make  the
    following findings.

40. We accept, on the balance of probabilities that the Appellant's parents
    died when she was two years old. Although the death  certificates  were
    not issued contemporaneously we have read them in the  round  with  the
    remaining evidence.

41. We accept that GT is the Appellant's biological maternal aunt.

42. We accept that since the death of her parents the  Appellant  has  been
    under the care of GAG and his wife WGG. We were  told  in  submissions,
    indeed it formed a central plank of the appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal,
    that these carers are simply family friends, unrelated in  any  way  to
    the Appellant. We have some reservations  about  whether  this  is  so,
    given the peculiar description  that  they  are  from  the  Appellant's
    "father's side of the family" but are prepared to accept that assertion
    for the purpose of this determination.  We accept that this couple  are
    now aged 75 and 62. We accept that they are both suffering with various
    ailments associated with aging, including heart disease,  diabetes  and
    arthritis.  We find however that the assertion  that  this  means  that
    they  are  "unable  to  care"  for  the  Appellant  is   entirely   un-
    particularised.  Whilst  it  could  be  readily  understood  how   such
    conditions might impede the ability of a carer to run  around  after  a
    toddler, it is not clear to us in  what  way  they  would  prevent  the
    couple from "looking after" a fifteen-year-old, as the Appellant was at
    the date of decision.  For instance, we were  not  shown  any  evidence
    that the medical conditions of the carers made it  more  difficult  for
    them to talk to the Appellant, offer her advice or love.  We find there
    to be no credible evidence that, having  cared  for  this  young  woman
    since her infancy, they are no longer prepared to do so.

43. We do not accept the unsupported assertion of GT that  the  Appellant's
    carers are of "modest  means"  and  that  her  niece  has  been  wholly
    financially dependent upon her. We find that GT has helped  to  support
    her niece financially, remitting money using money  transfer  companies
    such as Western Union and sending gifts and money via friends who  were
    visiting Ethiopia.   As her aunt,  and  in  the  circumstances  of  her
    sister's death, it is only natural that she should do so. Similarly  we
    are quite happy to accept that she has paid her school fees  and  taken
    an interest in her education. We consider it  however  to  be  unlikely
    that her carers are facing any kind of financial difficulty  given  the
    evidence that they are able to travel to Europe, Asia and  America  for
    private medical treatment.   On the contrary, this would indicate  that
    they are financially very comfortable.

44. We have no reason to doubt that the Appellant  and  GT  speak  to  each
    other regularly and that since GT's marriage the Appellant has  started
    to speak to HZ as well. We accept that in 2009 GT  went  to  visit  the
    Appellant and whilst there instituted adoption  proceedings.   We  note
    however  that  in  the  six  years  since  the  Ethiopian  courts  have
    recognised the Sponsor as the Appellant's adoptive mother she  has  not
    been back to visit her.

45. Having considered all of that evidence we are unable to make a  finding
    that it would be in the Appellant's best interests to come and live  in
    the UK. She has lived in Ethiopia with GAG and WGG since she was a very
    young child. There is every indication that they  have  cared  for  her
    well, for instance ensuring that she  has  received  an  education  and
    healthcare.  It is apparent from their statements, and acknowledged  by
    GT, that they have  treated  the  Appellant  with  love  and  kindness.
    Although the Visa Application Form has been signed by the Appellant  we
    note that it was completed by a relative on her father's  side  of  the
    family (described by the Appellant in the VAF  as  her  "brother")  and
    that she was only 15 when she completed it.  We have no direct evidence
    from her that she actually wants to come to live in the UK. That  is  a
    striking omission given that at the date of the appeal before us she is
    now 18 years old and obviously able to speak  for  herself.    She  has
    never been to the UK, has never met HZ in  person  and  has  only  ever
    spent a matter of weeks with GT.   We are unable to find that it  would
    be in her best interests to leave her education,  home  and  everything
    she knows in Ethiopia in order to come to a  strange  country  to  live
    with a woman whom she did not meet until she was 12 years old  and  has
    not seen since.

46. It follows that we do not accept, on  this  assessment  of  the  facts,
    that  there  are  any  "serious  and   compelling   family   or   other
    considerations" which would render a refusal of entry  undesirable.  In
    making this finding we have had regard to the terms of the IDI, and the
    argument presented on behalf of the Appellant. The guidance reads: "the
    objective of this provision is to allow a child to join his  parent  or
    relative in this country only where that child could not be  adequately
    cared for by his parents or relatives  in  his  own  country".   It  is
    suggested that this sentence raises an  inverse  inference  that  entry
    should be given where the day to day carers are not relatives.  That is
    a fallacious syllogism. The guidance simply points out  to  case-owners
    that entry should not be granted where children  are  being  adequately
    cared for by relatives. That does not mean that entry must  be  granted
    where they are being adequately cared for by someone else. The test  is
    that contained in the Rule, and on the facts, it has not been met.

47. The second limb of the test in 297(i)(f) requires the Appellant to show
    that "suitable arrangements" have been made for her care in the  United
    Kingdom. At the Error of Law stage Judge Bruce invited  submissions  on
    whether the protection regime relating to inter-country adoption should
    in principle be extended to children in similar  circumstances  seeking
    leave to enter under 297(i)(f).   We are aware that this provision  has
    in the past been successfully used by children seeking  entry  to  join
    relatives in the UK where non-recognised adoptions had taken place: see
    for instance SK ("adoption" not recognised  in  the  UK)  India  [2006]
    UKAIT 00068.  We have however been shown  no  authority  in  which  the
    Tribunal or higher courts have considered whether  the  test  "suitable
    arrangements  have  been  made  for  the  child's  care"    should   be
    interpreted to reflect those child protection measures.

48. It appears to us that there would be good reason  to  do  so.   As  the
    Upper Tribunal noted in SK, the Immigration Rules should be read  as  a
    whole, and should "be constructed in such a way  as  to  be  consistent
    with the rest of English and United  Kingdom  law  on  the  effects  of
    overseas  adoptions".    We  are  not  satisfied  that  there  is   any
    justification for drawing a distinction  between  blood  relatives  and
    entirely unrelated adopters: where the latter are  always  required  to
    produce a Certificate of Eligibility to Adopt[4] it must  be  the  case
    that the former must reach the same, or substantially similar standard,
    in meeting the test in 297(i)(f).  The Immigration Rules  on  entry  of
    adopted children reflect the United Kingdom's international obligations
    (for instance against trafficking) and the  domestic  legal  framework,
    which sets out the circumstances in which adoptive parents are entitled
    to bring their adopted children here to join them.   That involves,  as
    a bare minimum, an independent professional assessment of  whether  the
    UK based carers are suitable persons to adopt a child. GT gave evidence
    to the effect that she has an annual CRB check at work and that she  is
    willing and able to look after her niece. That is simply not enough.

49. The test of "suitable arrangements have been made for the child's care"
    is a high one. It cannot be discharged simply by pointing to  the  fact
    that a sponsor  is  employed,  has  a  house,  or  is  related  to  the
    applicant.  It  requires  a  rigorous  assessment  of   the   sponsor's
    suitability as a carer.  The Rules have been put in place as a means of
    child protection, to prevent children being sent to live  for  instance
    with a "family friend" or "aunty" without any  oversight  into  whether
    such individuals are suitable carers. The consequences of a failure  to
    have such oversight are starkly illustrated by cases such  as  that  of
    Victoria Climbie, and by the growing number of  children  found  to  be
    trafficked to the UK for the purpose of domestic servitude. Home Office
    caseowners, ECOs  and  Tribunal  judges  are  not  professional  social
    workers. The application and appeal  processes  do  not  in  themselves
    provide the scope for the proper assessment of sponsors, and no  matter
    how pleasant or dedicated a sponsor  may  appear  at  a  hearing,  such
    fleeting impressions are  no  substitute  for  thorough  assessment  in
    compliance  with  the  relevant  procedures  pertaining  to   'adopted'
    children.

    Article 8 ECHR

50. Family life can exist between an adoptive parent and an adoptive  child
    for the purpose of Article 8: X v France No 9993/82, 31 DR 241  (1982),
    Singh v ECO, New Delhi [2004]  EWCA  Civ  1075.    The  fact  that  the
    adoption is not formally recognised by the  UK  would  not  necessarily
    preclude a finding of family life, since Article  8  requires  decision
    makers to look to the substance of the relationship rather than  simply
    the form: see for instance  Johnstone  v  Ireland  (Appl.  No  9697/82)
    [1986] ECHR 17, Kroon v the Netherlands (1995) 19 EHRR 263.  We further
    regard it as uncontroversial that 'family life' could exist  between  a
    minor niece and her aunt.

51. In this case there are certainly two formal relationships in  play;  GT
    is at once the Appellant's maternal aunt, and by operation of Ethiopian
    law, her adoptive mother. We are however not satisfied that  either  or
    both of these formal relationships are  capable  of  establishing  that
    there is here a family life of  substance  such  that  the  Article  is
    engaged.

52. GT has given  discrepant  evidence  about  when  she  first  'met'  the
    Appellant. In her witness statement it  is  said  that  that  she  left
    Eritrea after she was born, but in her oral evidence  stated  that  the
    first time she met the Appellant in the flesh was 2009. Little turns on
    this, since the Appellant would have been a tiny baby when she left. We
    find as fact that the only meaningful face to face contact the  Sponsor
    and the Appellant have ever enjoyed was during a trip in 2009 when  the
    Sponsor stayed in Ethiopia for just short of  three  months.    In  her
    evidence GT said that she had endeavoured to regularise her position in
    the UK "as soon as possible" so that the Appellant could join her.  She
    secured settled status in June 2005 and yet it was not until  September
    2009, over four years  later,  that  she  visited  the  Appellant.  The
    application for entry clearance was  not  made  until  May  2013,  some
    eights years after GT was granted ILR.  The possible  explanations  for
    that delay - financial and practical constraints - do  not  sit  easily
    with the fact that in 2007 GT decided to travel to Sudan to get married
    to HZ, and then pursue an application for entry clearance for  him.  HZ
    was candid in his evidence  when  he  acknowledged  that  GT  had  here
    "prioritized" the marriage over the Appellant.   We do not accept  that
    GT considers the Appellant to be "like her  own  child";  if  she  did,
    there would not have been a long delay in bothering  to  visit  her,  a
    further delay in making the application for entry  clearance,  and  she
    would not have prioritised anything over seeing her, and  bringing  her
    to join her in the UK.

53. We accept that GT has a love and fondness for the Appellant because she
    is her aunt, and that she feels a sense of increased responsibility for
    her because her parents  have  passed  away.  That  responsibility  has
    prompted her to send her gifts and some money over the  years,  and  to
    keep in regular contact with her.   As the Appellant  has  grown  older
    and approached the age where she will be leaving secondary education GT
    has made some efforts to bring her to the UK.    We  have  found  those
    efforts to be somewhat  perfunctory.   Although  GT  went  through  the
    adoption process in Ethiopia it appears to us that the sole reason  for
    that was in order to make an application for entry clearance.  We  were
    given no satisfactory explanation as to why the Sponsor had not  sought
    such an Order at an earlier date.   There was a  substantial  delay  in
    the first visit, there has not been one since,  and  GT  has  expressly
    declined to take the opportunity to  obtain  approval  as  an  adoptive
    parent in the UK. Her declaration that she does not need any support or
    advice on being a parent is striking given that she  has  never  looked
    after a child and has spent only a very short period  of  time  staying
    with the Appellant.   The level of  commitment  that  GT  has  actually
    shown to the Appellant is not commensurate with her claim that she  has
    always thought of her as her daughter and that she would do anything to
    be  with  her.  We  do  not  accept  that  there  is  here  a  parental
    relationship. Nor do we accept that the fondness and love that  GT  and
    the Appellant no doubt have for each other amounts to a relationship of
    such substance that Article 8 is engaged.  This matter can therefore be
    distinguished on its facts from Singh, in which the accepted facts were
    that the family in question had adopted  a  baby  at  birth,  had  made
    immediate attempts for him to gain entry clearance, who had visited him
    regularly throughout his life and where the child believed his sponsors
    to be his natural parents.

54. If we are wrong in that assessment and there is a family life,  we  are
    not satisfied that the decision betrays a lack of  respect  for  it  or
    that the decision could be said to be disproportionate. It is  for  the
    ECO to show the decision  to  be  proportionate,  and  he  does  so  by
    pointing to the UKs domestic measures and international obligations  in
    respect of the welfare of the child. For  the  reasons  we  have  given
    above in respect of 297(i)(f),  these are  weighty  concerns  which  we
    find are not, in this case,  displaced by the evidence.    There  is  a
    substantial public interest in refusing entry to children where it  has
    not been established that they will be living  in  a  safe  and  caring
    environment.   This sponsor has produced no satisfactory evidence  that
    she is a suitable person  to  look  after  this  child,  and  in  those
    circumstances  we  find  the  decision  to  be  wholly  justified   and
    proportionate.

    Decisions

55. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contains an error  of  law
    and it is set aside to the extent identified above.

56. The decision in  the  appeal  is  remade  as  follows:  the  appeal  is
    dismissed on all grounds.

57. In view of the fact that the Appellant was  a  minor  at  the  date  of
    application and decision, and having had  regard  to  Rule  14  of  the
    Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules  2008  and  the  Presidential
    Guidance Note No 1 of 2013: Anonymity Orders,  we  make  the  following
    direction:

         "Unless and until  a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
         Appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
         shall directly or indirectly identify her  or  any  member  of  her
         family.  This direction applies both to the Appellant  and  to  the
         Respondent.  Failure to comply with this direction  could  lead  to
         contempt of court proceedings".
