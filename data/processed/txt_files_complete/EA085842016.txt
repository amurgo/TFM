                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction and Background

 1. The Appellant is a male Ukrainian citizen born  20th  August  1984  who
    appealed against a decision of Judge Miller of the First-tier  Tribunal
    (the FtT) promulgated on 20th September 2016.

 2. On 12th June 2010 the  Appellant  married  an  EEA  national.   On  4th
    January 2011 he was issued with a residence card as a family member  of
    an EEA national, which was valid until 4th January 2016.

 3. The marriage ended in divorce on 25th February 2015.  On 5th  May  2015
    the Appellant applied for a  retained  right  of  residence  which  the
    Respondent granted on 23rd October 2015 valid until 23rd October  2020.



 4. On 15th January 2016 the Appellant  applied  for  permanent  residence.
    This was refused  on  29th  June  2016  with  reference  to  regulation
    15(1)(f) of The Immigration (European Economic Area)  Regulations  2006
    (the  2006  Regulations).   In  the  reasons  for  refusal  letter  the
    Respondent also referred to regulation 10(5) of the  2006  Regulations.
    The Respondent noted that  the  Appellant  had  been  granted  retained
    rights of residence on 23rd October 2015 valid until 23rd October 2020.
     It was accepted that the Appellant was divorced and that he  had  been
    exercising treaty rights since the date of  divorce.   The  application
    was refused  because  it  was  not  accepted  that  evidence  had  been
    submitted to prove that the Appellant's former spouse (the Sponsor) had
    been residing in the UK in accordance with the 2006 Regulations  for  a
    continuous five year period.

 5. It was accepted that some evidence had been submitted  in  relation  to
    the former spouse exercising treaty  rights,  such  as  word  processed
    invoices between June 2010  -  March  2015,  three  national  insurance
    documents relating to August 2010, March 2014, and October  2014,  HMRC
    tax returns for the tax years ending 2011, 2012, 2013,  and  2014,  and
    seven pay slips from Lakerthorne Group Services  dated  August  2014  -
    February 2015.

 6. The Respondent  did  not  accept  that  sufficient  evidence  had  been
    provided to prove that the former spouse was exercising  treaty  rights
    between June 2010 and March 2015 as claimed.

 7. The Appellant requesting the appeal to be decided on the  papers.   The
    FtT acceded to that request, decided the appeal on the  papers,  noting
    that the Appellant had submitted a bundle comprising 656 pages.

 8. The FtT was not satisfied that the documentary evidence discharged  the
    burden of proof, in relation to the Sponsor  exercising  treaty  rights
    for a continuous five year period up to the date  of  divorce  and  the
    appeal was dismissed.

 9. The Appellant applied for, and was granted,  permission  to  appeal  by
    Upper Tribunal Judge Lindsley.

Error of Law

10. At a hearing before me on 4th May 2017 I heard  submissions  from  both
    parties  regarding  error  of  law.   Full  details  of  the  grant  of
    permission, and the submissions made, are contained in my error of  law
    decision promulgated on 17th May 2017.  I set out below my  conclusions
    and reasons for finding an error of law and setting aside the  decision
    of the FtT;

         18.  The FtT failed to analyse and consider material evidence.  For
             example, there is evidence that at the date of  divorce,  that
             being 25th February 2015, the Sponsor  was  exercising  treaty
             rights.  There is an invoice at page 146  of  the  Appellant's
             bundle for �205, reflected in the Sponsor's bank statement  at
             page 186 of the  bundle.   The  money  was  deposited  in  the
             account on 3rd March 2015.  A pay slip dated 5th February 2015
             at page 147 of the Appellant's bundle in the sum of �703.84 is
             reflected in the Sponsor's bank statement at page 185  of  the
             bundle, the funds being deposited on 10th February 2015.

         19.  It is not evident from the FtT decision, that the  documentary
             evidence relating to the Sponsor exercising treaty rights, was
             analysed and considered.

         20.  The FtT did not consider the guidance in Samsam,  particularly
             at paragraphs 26 and 59, although it must be said that the FtT
             was not greatly assisted by the parties in this appeal, and  I
             could not locate specific reference to Samsam by either party.
              There was however reference to section 40 of the  UK  Borders
             Act 2007 in the Grounds of Appeal, which enables the Secretary
             of State to make appropriate enquiries with HMRC in  order  to
             establish whether an EEA national is exercising treaty rights.
              This is a point made in paragraph 26 of Samsam.  In paragraph
             59 it is noted  that  in  marriage  breakdown  cases,  an  EEA
             national  spouse  may  not  wish  to  cooperate  in  providing
             evidence and a  material  consideration  may  be  whether  the
             Respondent  has  previously  accepted  the  EEA  national  was
             working or otherwise exercising treaty rights.

         21.  Linked to the above  point,  is  a  failure  to  consider  the
             acceptance by the Respondent that on  the  basis  of  evidence
             provided by the Appellant in May 2015, it was accepted that he
             was entitled to a retained right of residence on divorce and a
             residence card was issued on 23rd October 2015.

         22.  With reference to adequacy of reasoning I set  out  below  the
             headnote to Budhathoki  (reasons  for  decision)  [2014]  UKUT
             00341 (IAC);

                  It is generally unnecessary and unhelpful  for  First-tier
                  Tribunal judgments  to  rehearse  every  detail  or  issue
                  raised in a case.  This leads to judgments becoming overly
                  long and confused and is not a proportionate  approach  to
                  deciding cases.  It is, however, necessary for  judges  to
                  identify and resolve key conflicts  in  the  evidence  and
                  explain in clear and brief terms their  reasons,  so  that
                  the parties can understand why they have won or lost.

         23.  The FtT decision has been described  as  brief,  but  that  in
             itself is not a fault.  The error, in my view, is a failure to
             provide adequate  reasons,  and  a  failure  to  consider  and
             analyse material evidence.

11. The hearing was then  adjourned  at  the  request  of  the  Appellant's
    representative, so  that  further  evidence  could  be  given  and  the
    decision re-made.  The Appellant had not  attended  the  error  of  law
    hearing, and the representative did not have  instructions  as  to  why
    not.

Re-making the Decision - Upper Tribunal Hearing 21st September 2017

12. At the commencement of the hearing I ascertained that  I  had  received
    all documentation upon which the parties intended  to  rely,  and  that
    each party had served the  other  with  any  documentation  upon  which
    reliance was to be placed.  Ms Solanki submitted a  skeleton  argument.
    In addition to the 695 page bundle that had been before  the  FtT,  the
    Appellant's  representatives  had   served   a   supplementary   bundle
    comprising 54 pages, and a witness statement of Jasmin Bugg, a  trainee
    solicitor, dated 20th September 2017, explaining why  the  evidence  at
    pages 47-52 of the supplementary bundle, had not been submitted to  the
    FtT, and was submitted for the first time in the supplementary  bundle,
    which was received by the Upper Tribunal on 7th  September  2017.   The
    hearing was put back to give Mr Tarlow an opportunity to  consider  the
    supplementary bundle.

13. When the hearing resumed Mr Tarlow stated that he did not object to the
    evidence at pages 47-52 of the supplementary bundle being admitted into
    evidence  as  it  was  clearly  relevant.   Mr  Tarlow   accepted   the
    authenticity of  that  evidence,  and  stated  that  in  view  of  that
    evidence, the Appellant's appeal was not opposed by the Respondent.

14. In view of that, Ms Solanki questioned whether I needed  to  hear  oral
    submissions from her, and confirmed that she relied upon  her  skeleton
    argument.  The content of the skeleton argument is comprehensive, and I
    therefore indicated that I did not need to hear oral submissions.

15. I then reserved my  decision  to  allow  me  to  consider  further  the
    documentary evidence.

My Conclusions and Reasons

16. The burden of proof is on the Appellant, and the standard of proof is a
    balance of probability.

17. The only issue that I was asked to  consider,  was  whether  sufficient
    evidence had been submitted to prove that the Appellant's former spouse
    was exercising treaty rights for the period between June 2010 when  the
    marriage took place, and  25th  February  2015  when  the  divorce  was
    finalised.

18. I  accept  that  some  documentary  evidence  was  submitted  with  the
    application, and that there is further documentary  evidence  contained
    within the initial bundle  presented  to  the  FtT.   As  noted  in  my
    conclusions when finding an error  of  law,  there  was  some  evidence
    within that bundle, referred to at paragraph 18  of  my  error  of  law
    decision, to indicate that the Sponsor was exercising treaty rights  at
    the date of divorce.  It is the Appellant's case that the  Sponsor  has
    been exercising treaty rights throughout the period of their  marriage,
    as an employee, and also in self-employment.

19. I find that there is evidence within the bundle that  at  the  date  of
    divorce in February 2015, the former spouse was undertaking both  self-
    employment and employment, as reflected in an invoice  for  �205  which
    was deposited into her bank account, and a  pay  slip  in  the  sum  of
    �703.84, which was also deposited into her bank account.

20. The evidence that should have been placed before the FtT and  was  not,
    for which the  Appellant's  solicitors  take  responsibility  (and  the
    author of the witness statement could not be at fault, as she  was  not
    employed by the firm at the relevant time), is the evidence  considered
    by Mr Tarlow, and which is contained in  the  supplementary  bundle  at
    pages 47-52.

21. I find that this evidence supplements the evidence that  was  submitted
    with the original application, and the evidence  contained  within  the
    initial bundle which was before the FtT, and which is referred to in my
    error of law decision.  The additional evidence has  been  produced  by
    HMRC and are documents referred to as SA302.  These documents relate to
    the Appellant's  former  spouse,  and  are  HMRC  tax  calculations  in
    relation to self-employment.  They relate to the tax years ending April
    2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016.  The  tax  calculation  ending  April
    2016 relates to a period after the divorce which took place in February
    2015.

22. These documents prove self-employment by the Appellant's former spouse.
     They therefore show that she was exercising treaty rights as  a  self-
    employed person, which means that she was a qualified person as defined
    by regulation 6 of the 2006 Regulations.  They do not  cover  a  period
    prior to the tax year ending April 2012, and these documents  alone  do
    not prove five years' self-employment.  However, the important point is
    that  these  documents  supplement  documentary  evidence   which   had
    previously been supplied, covering a period between June 2010 and April
    2011, which is the period not covered by  these  HMRC  documents.   The
    evidence already submitted included invoices and HMRC tax returns.

23. Mr Tarlow inspected  the  documents  and  was  satisfied  as  to  their
    authenticity and  was  satisfied  that  in  totality,  the  documentary
    evidence proved that the  former  spouse  had  been  exercising  treaty
    rights for a continuous five year period.  For that reason he  did  not
    oppose the appeal.   I  am  satisfied  that  the  documentary  evidence
    submitted does prove that  the  former  spouse  was  exercising  treaty
    rights for the duration of the marriage, that being between  June  2010
    and February  2015.   I  therefore  conclude  that  the  Appellant  has
    discharged the burden of proof and is entitled to permanent residence.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained an error of  law  and  was
set aside.

I substitute a fresh decision.  The appeal is allowed.



Anonymity

No anonymity direction was made by the First-tier Tribunal.  There has  been
no request for anonymity made to the Upper Tribunal and I  see  no  need  to
make an anonymity order.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

Because I have allowed the appeal I have considered whether to  make  a  fee
award.  I make no award.  This is because  the  required  evidence  was  not
submitted with the application.
