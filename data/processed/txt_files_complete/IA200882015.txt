Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Okoroh, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr Avery, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Nigeria (born 12th September  1972).   He
    appealed against the decision of the Respondent  dated  18th  May  2015
    refusing to grant him permanent residence in the United  Kingdom  under
    Regulation 15 of the EEA Regulations  2006,  as  the  ex-spouse  of  Ms
    Analucia Lopes, a Portuguese citizen.   It  is  claimed  that  she  was
    exercising treaty rights for at least five years up to the  point  that
    she and the Appellant divorced on 14th September 2014.

 2. The appeal was heard by Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal  Bradshaw  on
    27th September 2016 and in a decision promulgated on 29th October 2016,
    the appeal was dismissed.

 3. An application for permission to appeal was lodged and  permission  was
    granted by FtTJ Hollingworth on 17th March 2017.  The permission states
    that it is arguable that the judge  has  not  set  out  a  full  enough
    analysis for why she did not accept that the evidence submitted by  the
    Appellant was sufficient to show that Ms Lopes had been  in  continuous
    employment for the requisite  five  year  period  up  to  the  date  of
    divorce.  This was with particular reference to the set of  P60s  which
    had been submitted.

 4. A Rule 24 response  was  served  by  the  Respondent  which  in  terms,
    submitted that the judge had directed herself appropriately  and  given
    explanations,  and  thus  reasons  why  she  had  disagreed  with   the
    Appellant's case.

 5. It is convenient at this point  to  set  out  the  background  to  this
    appeal. The Appellant entered the UK  on  an  unknown  date.   On  18th
    December 2009 he married Analucia Lopes, a Portuguese  citizen  present
    in the UK.  On 16th November 2010 he was issued with a  residence  card
    as a family member of an EEA national exercising treaty rights.

 6. On 15th September 2014 the Appellant and Ms Lopes were  divorced.   The
    Appellant applied on 31st December 2014 for a permanent residence  card
    on the basis that Ms Lopes was continuously exercising treaty rights as
    a worker from 5th April 2009 to 15th September 2014.

 7. In  support  of  the  application  there  was  produced  the  following
    documents relating to Ms Lopes' employment:

         P60 for 2009/2010

         P60 for 2010/2011

         P60 for 2011/2012

         P60 for 2012/2013

         P60 for 2013/2014

    In all, these 5 P60s cover the period 6th April 2009 to 5th April 2014.
     In addition, there was a set of pay slips for  employment  at  Alvonso
    Davis Enterprises Limited for five consecutive months from May 2014  to
    September 2014. There was no payslip for April 2014 showing  employment
    and no explanation for this absence.

 8. The Respondent refused the application initially because  she  was  not
    satisfied that the P60s were the product of genuine trading  companies.
    Secondly, it was noted that the wage slips produced showed  wages  paid
    in cash which made it difficult to confirm the employment, there  being
    no evidence of wages being paid or banked.

 9. When the appeal came before the First-tier Tribunal, the judge narrowed
    the issue when she said the following:

         "It was agreed that the only issue for me to determine was  whether
         the Appellant could rely on his ex-wife's having  exercised  treaty
         rights for a continuous  period  of  five  years  to  the  date  of
         divorce".[5]

The UT Error of Law Hearing

10. Before me Mr Okoroh attended on behalf of the Appellant  and  Mr  Avery
    for the Respondent.  Mr Okoroh's submissions relied in the main on  the
    lines of the grounds  seeking  permission.   The  main  thrust  of  his
    submissions  centred  on  the  P60s  relating  to  Ms  Lopes'   claimed
    employment.

11. He submitted that the evidence of the P60s  alone  were  sufficient  to
    show continuity of employment for the requisite period.  Although  they
    are a bare statement of Ms Lopes' employment, nevertheless they  amount
    to sufficient evidence.  Likewise, when coupled with the evidence of Ms
    Lopes' pay slips there was sufficient  evidence  up  to  the  point  of
    divorce to show that Ms Lopes  was  working  and  therefore  exercising
    treaty rights.  The decision of the First-tier Tribunal should  be  set
    aside for error as  the  judge  had  not  properly  explained  why  she
    rejected the sufficiency  of  that  evidence.   The  appeal  should  be
    allowed.

12. Mr Avery defended the decision.  He submitted that the P60s  alone  did
    not, in this case, go anywhere  near  to  showing  that  Ms  Lopes  was
    continuously exercising treaty rights as a  worker  for  the  requisite
    period.  He submitted that the  judge  had  accepted  that  it  may  be
    difficult for an ex-spouse to obtain evidence but there was a  question
    mark over the minimal amount of earnings showed on the P60s.  There was
    an absence of evidence in this  case  detailing  Ms  Lopes'  employment
    history sufficient to show that she had been exercising  treaty  rights
    over the five year period.  He submitted that the  figures  simply  did
    not add up and that the judge was correct in her analysis at  [23]  and
    [24].  The decision was sustainable and should therefore stand.

Consideration

13. Both representatives were in agreement that the FtT Judge had correctly
    identified at [5] the only issue before her was whether  the  Appellant
    could rely on his ex-wife having exercised treaty rights for five years
    up to the point of divorce.

14. Mr Okoroh's challenge to the judge's decision centred on a criticism of
    her analysis in [23] when she said that a P60  does  not  of  necessity
    give a full picture of work for the tax year in question.  It gives the
    total earned in  the  tax  year  and  does  not  account  for  gaps  in
    employment or time off work generally.  Mr Okoroh's criticism ran on to
    say that the judge had  speculated  and  had  failed  to  say  why  the
    evidence of the P60s and pay slips  was  insufficient  to  satisfy  the
    Regulation.

15. I find that the FtTJ was correct in her analysis at  [23]  to  [24]  in
    concluding that the P60s were insufficient to enable the  Appellant  to
    discharge the evidential burden upon him.  I say this for the following
    reasons.

16. The Appellant's case is that his ex-wife worked continuously throughout
    the relevant period.   If  one  looks  at  the  oral  evidence  of  the
    Appellant, he is noted as saying in his evidence before the FtT at [14]
    that during the time when he and Ms Lopes were together, she only  ever
    worked part-time and she has  "certainly  done  agency  work"  at  some
    stages.  However at [20], the Appellant is recorded as saying (possibly
    discussing the employment relating to 2013/2014) that Ms Lopes  "worked
    varying hours but generally five or six hours, four or  five  days  per
    week".

17. An analysis of the P60s show the following documented earnings  for  Ms
    Lopes:

         2009/2010     �2,410

         2010/2011     �3,699

         2011/2012     �4,530

         2012/2013     �4,401

         2013/2014     �5,772

    Thus, for example taking the year ending 5th April  2010  and  applying
    the relevant minimum wage of �5.80 per hour  applicable  at  the  time,
    this equates to her working on average  only  around  eight  hours  per
    week.

18. A further analysis applied to Ms Lopes'  employment  at  Alvonso  Davis
    shows that payslips were produced for the period May 2014 to  September
    2014.  These showed five months' earnings at �350 per month (there  was
    no payslip for  April  2014).   Thus  the  earnings  at  Alvonso  Davis
    amounted to �1,750 by the end of September 2014 which, if  extrapolated
    to the tax year end, would show annual earnings of �3,850.  This  falls
    far short of what the Appellant said in evidence,  which  was  that  Ms
    Lopes generally worked five to six hours a day, four to five  days  per
    week.  The minimum hourly wage during  the  relevant  period  in  2014,
    assuming she was over 21 years of age, was �6.31 per hour.   Using  the
    average given in the Appellant's own evidence, she worked 5� hours  per
    day on 4� days per week.  Even if one were to  factor  in  4  weeks  of
    unpaid leave in the year, this  would  equate  to  �7,500  whereas  the
    projected amount at Alvonso Davis equates to �3,850 per annum only.

19. I am bound to say that the discrepancies identified in  the  above  two
    paragraphs raise a substantial question mark over whether Ms Lopes  had
    been in continuous employment throughout  the  requisite  period.  This
    question remains unanswered.   The  plain  fact  is  that  there  is  a
    conspicuous lack of evidence in this appeal  -  evidence  detailing  Ms
    Lopes' employment history.  Mr Okoroh did not seek  to  address  me  on
    these apparent discrepancies in the evidence but simply urged  upon  me
    that the "bare statements of the P60s" and the pay slips produced  were
    sufficient evidence to show that the FtT Judge had erred in  dismissing
    the appeal.  I find that the reverse is true.  The judge  has  properly
    dealt with the evidence before her.

20. Mr Okoroh has characterised the judge's findings as speculation in  the
    sense that when talking about the P60s she  says  that  they  give  the
    total earned in the tax year and do not account for gaps in  employment
    or time off work generally.  That wording may have been better  phrased
    had the judge confined her remarks to pointing out that the Appellant's
    own evidence is lacking in  demonstrating  a  proper  knowledge  of  Ms
    Lopes' employment history, but the result would have been the same.

21. The judge is correct in her conclusion that the evidence before her did
    not demonstrate that  the  Appellant  had  on  balance  discharged  the
    evidential burden upon him.  Therefore for the  foregoing  reasons,  it
    follows that the appeal before me must be dismissed.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal promulgated  on  17th  October  2016
contains no material error of law.  The decision therefore stands.

No anonymity direction is made.

The FtT's decision to make no fee award stands.
