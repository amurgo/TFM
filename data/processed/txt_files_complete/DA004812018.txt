Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Mills, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Holt


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. I shall refer in this  decision  to  the  Secretary  of  State  as  the
    'respondent'  and  to  the  respondent  as  the  'appellant'  as   they
    respectively appeared before the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. The appellant was born on 7 November 1994 and  is  a  male  citizen  of
    Portugal. On 17 July 2018, a decision was made to deport the  appellant
    to Portugal under  section  5(1)  of  the  Immigration  Act  1971.  The
    appellant appealed to the First-tier  Tribunal  which,  in  a  decision
    promulgation on 17 October 2018, allowed the appeal. The  Secretary  of
    State now appeals, with permission, to the Upper Tribunal.

 3. The appellant first  came  to  the  attention  of  the  United  Kingdom
    authorities in December 2010 when he was arrested for robbery.  Between
    7 January 2011 and  5  September  2016,  the  appellant  received  four
    convictions  for  seven  offences  including  theft   and   drugs.   In
    particular, on 3 August 2016 at Nottingham Crown Court,  the  appellant
    was convicted of producing a controlled drug  (Class  B)  possessing  a
    controlled drug with the intent to supply (heroin:  Class  A).  He  was
    sentenced  on  5  September  2016  to  total  3  years  and  10  months
    imprisonment and ordered to pay the victim surcharge of ï¿½120.

    The 2006 or the 2016 Regulations. 'imminent'; 'present'

 4. The Secretary of  State  submits  that  the  judge  applied  the  wrong
    regulations and, in consequence, failed to have regard to the fact that
    the threat posed by an individual to one of the  fundamental  interests
    of society 'does not need to be imminent.'

 5. It is clear that the judge did refer to the former regulations of  2006
    at [61]; she refers to the test in  'regulation  21(5)'.  Both  parties
    agree that the  relevant  regulations  are  the  Immigration  (European
    Economic Area) Regulations 2016 in particular, regulation  27(5)  which
    has replaced the former 2006  regulation  21(5).  The  wording  of  the
    relevant regulation is very similar to that which it replaced  although
    it does require a  decision  maker  to  have  regard  to  whether  'the
    personal conduct of the person concerned must  represent[s]  a  genuine
    present  and  sufficiently  serious  threat  affecting   one   of   the
    fundamental interests of society, taking into account past  conduct  of
    the person and that the threat  does  not  need  to  be  imminent'  [my
    emphasis].  The  respondent  argues  that,  by  applying   the   former
    regulation, the judge fell into error because she  allowed  the  appeal
    purely on the basis that there was insufficient evidence to  show  that
    the appellant poses a current threat and in doing so,  she  ignored  or
    gave insufficient weight to the report  of  OAsys  which  assessed  the
    future risk posed by the appellant of reoffending as medium,  giving  a
    percentage chance of reoffending in the next  two  years  as  56%.  The
    judges was concerned with identifying  the  existence  of  an  imminent
    threat and in consequence her analysis was flawed.

 6. I do not find that this submission has merit. First, I am satisfied the
    judge, while she does refer to the former regulation, also had  in  her
    mind the appropriate regulation which she sets out in full at [11] I am
    not satisfied that anything in the decision indicates  that  the  judge
    applied the former regulation or failed  to  have  regard  to  relevant
    regulation which she has quoted verbatim. Secondly, whilst  she  refers
    to the former regulation 21(5) she  does  not  quote  it  or  expressly
    indicate that she has applied it. Thirdly, the judge did have regard to
    the OAsys report and its conclusions (which she summarises  accurately)
    and there is no suggestion that she rejected that evidence. Rather, she
    considered it together  with  all  the  other  evidence  which  he  was
    entitled to consider, including the oral  testimony  of  the  appellant
    himself. I find that the judge's reference to  the  former  regulations
    did not lead her into error.




    The OAsys report/the appellant's evidence: Perversity?

 7. The argument advanced by Mr Mills, for the Secretary of State,  may  be
    summarised as follows. The OAsys report represented a professional  and
    objective assessment of the likelihood of the appellant reoffending  in
    the next 2 years. The percentage  chance  indicated  was  56%.  On  the
    standard of the balance of probabilities, therefore, it was more likely
    that the appellant would reoffend in the next  2  years  than  that  he
    would not. Set against that evidence,  the  appellant  himself  claimed
    that he did not intend to reoffend but that he intended to rehabilitate
    himself. The appellant, at the time  he  gave  oral  testimony  to  the
    judge, had not long left prison and there was simply no basis  for  the
    judge to accept his evidence in preference to that of  the  report.  By
    doing so, her reasoning was perverse.

 8. Having considered the decision very carefully and, as urged by Mr  Holt
    for the appellant, holistically, I  am  satisfied  the  judge  has  not
    fallen into error. First, I agree with  Mr  Holt  that  the  judge  was
    required to carry out a  robust  fact-finding  exercise.  She  had  the
    opportunity of hearing oral evidence, which the Upper Tribunal has  not
    enjoyed. I accept that the apportionment of weight to various items  of
    evidence was a matter for the judge and I do  not  find  that  she  has
    reached perverse findings or that she has carried out the  fact-finding
    exercise in anything other than a judicial manner. Another judge, faced
    with the same facts, may have reached a different outcome but  that  is
    not the point. It was open  to  the  judge  to  attach  weight  to  the
    appellant's evidence. Significantly, at [53],  it  is  clear  that  the
    judge did not simply accept the appellant's word that he  had  reformed
    his behaviour. The judge considered his evidence in the context of  his
    recently-formed family life with his partner and child. The  judge  was
    not taking at face value the evidence of an individual  whose  personal
    circumstances had not change since he had committed criminal  offences;
    the appellant circumstances had changed and  the  judge  was  right  to
    consider his evidence in the context of his new circumstances.

 9. Secondly, whilst I acknowledge, as I believe did the judge, the  weight
    properly attaching to the OAsys report, it does not follow that if such
    a report indicates a likelihood of reoffending greater  than  50%  that
    such an opinion would inevitably outweigh all other evidence  and  lead
    inexorably to the  conclusion  that  an  individual  must  represent  a
    present threat.  In  essence,  Mr  Mills  suggested  that  the  judge's
    acceptance of the appellant as  a  reformed  character  was  premature,
    coming to soon after his release  from  custody.  Indeed,  he  proposed
    that, if I were to find an error of law and set aside the decision,  it
    would be appropriate for there to be a new fact-finding exercise  which
    would consider the appellant and his  family's  current  circumstances.
    That is a suggestion which does not sit easily with the assertion  that
    the judge reached a perverse conclusion. Rather, it indicates that  the
    passage of time together with a lack  of  offending  might  enable  the
    appellant to succeed in his appeal on remittal. At  the  core  of  this
    appeal is the question whether it was open to the judge to  prefer  the
    evidence of the appellant so soon after his  release  from  custody  to
    that contained in the report. I find that it was. I find that the judge
    was aware of the pitfalls which might endanger her  analysis.  At  [55-
    57], she makes specific reference to Essa [2013] UKUT 00316  (IAC)  and
    MC [2015] UKUT 00520 (IAC). She noted that, 'the Tribunal  in  MC  held
    the reference to the prospects of  rehabilitation  concerns  reasonable
    prospects of a person ceasing to commit crime, not the mere possibility
    of  rehabilitation.  It  also  held  that  matters  are  relevant  when
    examining the prospects of  the  rehabilitation  of  offenders  include
    family ties and responsibilities, accommodation,  education,  training,
    employment active membership of the community and  the  like.'  I  find
    that the judge had that principle firmly in mind  when  she  considered
    the appellant's testimony and I do not accept that she simply  accepted
    the appellant's  assurances  shorn  of  any  context.  Ultimately,  she
    reached  a  decision  which  was  open  to   her   on   her   findings.
    Notwithstanding her reference to a former regulation, I find  that  she
    had proper regard to  and  applied  the  correct  regulation  and  also
    applied appropriate jurisprudence. She gave appropriate weight  to  the
    OAsys report but properly considered it together with all the  relevant
    evidence. I find that she did not err in law for the  reasons  advanced
    in the grounds of appeal or at all.
