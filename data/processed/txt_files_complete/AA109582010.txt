For the appellant:  Raza Halim (counsel instructed by Kesar & Co,

For the respondent: Miss Helen Horsley

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

       This is an appeal, by the , against the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge John Ritson), sitting at  Birmingham  on  22  September
    2010, to  a s. 83 ''upgrade'  appeal by someone  who  claims  to  be  a
    citizen of Afghanistan, born 1 September 1995. The appellant  got  into
    this country in the back of a a lorry and claimed asylum on 25 February
    2010, giving a history of having left Afghanistan six months before. On
    11 June he was refused asylum, but given leave to  remain  to  1  March
    2013, when he was 17ï¿½.

 2. On 23 December 2010 Judge Lance Waumsley, with the consent of the  Home
    Office, declared an error of law in the judge's decision, and  directed
    a re-hearing. This was listed before Irwin J and Judge Catriona  Jarvis
    on 19 January 2011; but, instead of  re-hearing  the  case  themselves,
    they gave detailed directions, written by Judge Jarvis, and running  to
    four pages. These included, by way of  a  note,  that  the  appellant's
    claimed age was accepted; but not his claim  to  be  from  Afghanistan,
    which they described as a 'key issue' for decision.

 3. Though Mr Halim recalled this issue being conceded  by  the  presenting
    officer on one of the several preliminary  hearings  which  have  taken
    place, neither the Tribunal file nor Miss Horsley's bore any indication
    of that; so it remains a live one for me to decide. Further  directions
    were given by Judge Jarvis on 8 March and 13  May  2011,  but  for  one
    reason or another it was not possible for her to hear the case  herself
    before she fell sick, and eventually it was  listed  before  me.  Since
    what I had to do amounted to a full fresh hearing, there is no need  to
    go into any of the directions here. I shall return  in  due  course  to
    what is said in them relevant to credibility.

 4. The appellant's case          as set out in his statements (25 May 2010
    and 1 March 2011, both of which he confirmed in oral  evidence)  is  as
    follows. He was born and brought up  in  Chaharbagh  village,  Qarghani
    district, Laghman province,  Afghanistan,  and  lived  there  with  his
    parents, going to school for about two years up to the age of seven  or
    eight. He had two  younger  brothers,  whose  names  he  gave  in  oral
    evidence as Mustafa and Abubakar. His father worked as  an  interpreter
    for foreign forces: he didn't know which, but he had seen  pictures  of
    him with European-looking people.  One  night  a  letter  arrived:  the
    appellant heard his father say it came from  the  Taleban,  threatening
    him and his family if  he  didn't  stop  working  for  the  foreigners.
    However his father needed the money, and went back to his job.

 5. The appellant had a maternal uncle  called  Ahmed  Shah,  living  at  a
    nearby village, whose name he didn't know, but where he and his  family
    regularly went to see him, sometimes on foot, and  sometimes  not.  One
    evening, when his father was next on leave, he and his mother  were  at
    his maternal uncle's, and his mother asked if he could stay the  night,
    which he did, while she went home to his father. Next morning  when  he
    went home, he found the family  house  burnt  down,  and  was  told  by
    neighbours that both his parents were dead: his  two  younger  brothers
    were still alive, with bandages round burns on their legs.  Because  of
    the letter, the appellant assumed that this had been an attack  by  the
    Taleban.

 6. After this, the appellant and his brothers  went  to  live  with  their
    maternal uncle. Some time passed, and his uncle told him he was getting
    old, and wouldn't be able to help him if trouble came; so he was making
    arrangements for him to leave Afghanistan. His brothers would have gone
    too; but they were still too young. In due course the appellant's uncle
    sold some land, and an agent came and collected him from  his  uncle's,
    for a destination unknown to him. On his way to this country he  passed
    through various countries: while he was in Iran, another boy  from  his
    village who was on his way west too received a phone-call from his  own
    paternal uncle, who passed on the news that the appellant's  uncle  was
    dead.

 7. It was when the lorry in which the  appellant  was  travelling  got  to
    Corby that he got out and was picked up  by  the  police.  Arrangements
    were made by the local authority to put him  in  foster  care,  with  a
    gentleman whose name he gives simply as Ray, and his  family.  Ray  was
    present at the appellant's asylum  interview  as  'responsible  adult',
    and, if I read the interviewer's  handwriting  right,  his  surname  is
    Skeen. It was good to see, not only a Northamptonshire  social  worker,
    but Mr Skeen too in court for  the  hearing:  both  he  and  the  local
    authority have clearly done their best for the  appellant.  However  Mr
    Halim realistically made no attempt to base his article 8 case for  him
    on his "private and family life" in this country, as  opposed  to  what
    would await him in Afghanistan.

 8. Cross-examined, the appellant said  he  hadn't  known,  when  asked  at
    interview on 17 May 2010, who his  father  was  working  for,  or  what
    languages he was using, because he was too young at the  time.  However
    his father had worked a month on, then a week off: when he  went  back,
    he used to leave the house in uniform. The appellant confirmed what  he
    had said in his second witness statement about his father  not  wanting
    to talk about his work (though  he  had  shown  him  the  photographs),
    because he was afraid of his children talking to others, and so putting
    the whole family at risk; but he agreed it had been no secret  that  he
    was working for foreign forces.

 9. As for why the appellant hadn't been able  to  give  the  name  of  his
    uncle's village, or any neighbouring ones, there was no bus service  in
    the area, so he hadn't needed to know it. He did know there were  other
    villages in the district, because people in his own had used to discuss
    their inhabitants and mosques; but they didn't mention their names. His
    school was only ten minutes from the family home: it wasn't  true  that
    he had been unable to say (in answer to Q22 at his interview) where his
    school was, other than that he had used to walk there "sometimes  fast,
    sometimes slow". The interpreter hadn't translated his words properly.

10. The appellant had stayed in his uncle's village with him for nearly  18
    months, till he left Afghanistan in about August 2009,  shortly  before
    he turned 14. He had no language problems in Iran,  since  his  mother,
    being a Tajik, had spoken Dari (rather than Pushtu like his father, and
    people in the area generally): Dari is  very  similar  to  the  Persian
    spoken in Iran, under the name of  Farsi.  The  appellant's  uncle  had
    given him neither any contact arrangements, nor any details about where
    he was going: his uncle had no mobile,  which  was  commoner  in  those
    days, when they cost more than people could afford.

11. In the appellant's bundle, compiled for this hearing, there is a letter
    to the appellant from the British Red Cross, dated 14 July 2010, saying
    they had started  the  process  of  tracing  his  brother  Mustafa,  in
    response to his request of 8 June. At the hearing Mr Halim produced for
    the first time a series of further letters from the Red  Cross  to  the
    appellant, each bearing a date three or four  months  after  the  last,
    going up to 15 February 2012: neither he nor his solicitors  had  taken
    the trouble to provide photocopies of these,  so  that  they  were  not
    available till after the lunch  adjournment,  when  the  appellant  had
    finished giving evidence.

12. Each of the  letters  is  headed  'Tracing  enquiry  regarding  Mustafa
    Hanifi', and none of them mentions any other name sought. Most  of  the
    letters  are  signed  by  Tim  Hollis,  of  the   British   Red   Cross
    International Tracing and Messaging Service at Leicester. Each of  them
    ends with a standard disclaimer, saying that the opening of  a  tracing
    request should not be taken as evidence, either that the person  sought
    is or is not missing, or does or does not exist,  with  a  similar  one
    about requests for the transmission of messages.



13. The letters seem to be in standard form, apart from the final one of 15
    February last year. That  ends  with  a  note,  in  bold  type  in  the
    original, which is worth setting out in full:

       NB: the Afghan Red  Crescent  Society  Field  Officer  reported  that
       Qarghayi is a big district of Laghman Province which includes several
       villages and it seems unfeasible to locate a person only  by  his/her
       name in such a big area, however the  Field  Officer  added  that  he
       contacted many persons at the main market of Qarghayi and  afterwards
       he went to the Qarghayi High School and asked about the sought person
       from the Head of the school  and  many  other  students.  Regretfully
       nobody recognized either the Sought Person and the  family,  nor  the
       enquirer.

       If you can provide the  following  information  we  may  be  able  to
       initiate a proper search:

         > Precise name of the village
         > Name of the nearest Mosque
         > Name of a well known person living in the neighbourhood
         > Name(s) of the villages which are near your own village

14. The appellant had said in cross-examination that he had asked  the  Red
    Cross to trace both his brothers,  Abubakar  as  well  as  Mustafa:  he
    didn't know why they hadn't mentioned Abubakar. He had no other  family
    members in Afghanistan, since his maternal uncle was dead. He confirmed
    (see his second witness statement, paragraph 21) that he had given  his
    uncle's name to the Red Cross: he says  there  that  this  was  on  his
    solicitor's advice, as not tracing him would be the only way of proving
    he was dead. In oral evidence the appellant added that he had given his
    uncle's name to help trace his brothers; but he  hadn't  been  able  to
    give the name of the mosque, or the school, as he didn't know them. The
    letter of 26 May 2011, the only one not from Mr Hollis, had given  2000
    as Mustafa's date of birth; but the appellant  said  that  hadn't  come
    from him. He  couldn't  explain  why  the  name  of  his  own  village,
    Chaharbagh, wasn't mentioned in any of the letters.

15. The 'country expert'   relied on for the appellant is Mr Mir Abas,  who
    is a British citizen of  Afghan  origin,  trading  under  the  name  of
    'Afmart I.T.A.B. Interpreting/Translation &  Associate  Bureau'.  After
    taking his degree in engineering at Kabul, he was a junior diplomat  at
    the Afghan Embassy in London till 1992, since when he has been  engaged
    in his  present  business,  including  a  spell  at  a  United  Nations
    conference in Bonn in late November 2001 as "official translator[1] for
    the UN". He says he has translated various books from Dari  and  Pushtu
    into English, and also follows the situation in Afghanistan closely and
    very keenly: he has been interviewed by the BBC and  Voice  of  America
    "... as a political analyser of Afghanistan situation.  I  am  able  to
    write reports about  the  situation  in  Afghanistan,  particularly  on
    nationality issues".

16. Miss Horsley objected to Mr Abas being treated as an expert witness  at
    all, and it is certainly not clear from the cv  he  gives  for  himself
    what specific expertise he could have on nationality  issues.  However,
    it is certainly not necessary for a 'country expert' to be an  academic
    or a journalist, and I prefer to consider his evidence on  its  merits,
    and then make up my own mind whether or not he should be treated as  an
    expert, and if so, how far. He does not give any details about  himself
    or his own place of origin, beyond what is in his cv, and cites by  way
    of sources only the 'Provisional Gazetteer of  Afghanistan',  and  that
    only for the information as to there  being  400  villages  in  Laghman
    province.

17. The main part of Mr Abas's report, headed 'Interview',  consists  in  a
    sort of questionnaire administered by him to  the  appellant.  Mr  Abas
    records that the appellant is  fluent  in  both  Pushtu  (his  father's
    language) and Dari (his  mother's),  which  as  he  mentions  are  both
    official languages in Afghanistan. The only evidence-based  support  he
    gives for this assessment, however, is the appellant's ability, at Q32,
    to give the right  answer  to  a  simple  sum  in  Dari.  The  previous
    questions vary from topography specific to Laghman province, which  the
    appellant answers correctly (at Qs. 5 -  7),  to  ones  about  his  own
    village at Qs. 8 - 10. Here the appellant is unable to give the name of
    his village headman (malik), though he knows he is a  Pushtun.  As  for
    the head of the mosque, he knows only that people  called  him  'Mullah
    Saheb', which is of course a title, rather than a  name:  'Monsieur  le
    curï¿½' would be a familiar European equivalent.

18. There are quite a  number  more  questions  about  Laghman,  and  about
    Afghanistan generally, most of which Mr Abas says  the  appellant  gets
    right. However, the only one specifically about  his  own  village  for
    which Mr Abas records what he regards as a correct  answer  is  Q.  23,
    where the appellant says the people there speak both Pushtu  and  Dari.
    Since Mr Abas does not claim any specific knowledge of  his  own  about
    the village, and the appellant does no more than locate  it  in  Qargha
    district (clearly the same as the Qarghayi referred to in the Red Cross
    letters), about an hour's drive from Laghman city, it is  hard  to  see
    how he can vouch for this with any degree of expertise.

19.  The  directions  given,  so  far  as  relevant  to   the   appellant's
    credibility, appear at paragraphs 17 - 19 of  the  original:  they  are
    helpfully set out in Mr Halim's skeleton argument,  together  with  the
    only specifically authoritative material relied on.  The  passage  from
    the directions reads:

  17. It does not appear that at any stage since his arrival in the UK on 25
      September 2010 the  respondent  has  taken  any  steps  to  facilitate
      contact between the appellant and his family, it having been  accepted
      that he was an unaccompanied child on arrival in the UK (although  the
      appellant produced evidence to show that he  had  personally  been  in
      contact with the Red Cross on 8 June 2010);
  18. This is despite Article  19  of  Council  Directive  2003/9/EC  of  27
      January 2003 laying down minimum standards for the reception of asylum
      seekers ("The Reception Directive") and Regulation 6(1) of the  Asylum
      Seekers (Reception Conditions) Regulation 2005, as well  as  the  1989
      UNCRC; and the respondent's Asylum  Policy  and  Process  Instruction,
      including currently the Asylum Process Guidance on  Asylum  Claims  of
      Children of September 2010, all which plainly show that it is accepted
      that it is the responsibility of the Home Secretary to take  steps  to
      facilitate contact between child and family, always assuming  that  to
      be a safe and appropriate course in the best interests of the child.
  19. Whilst there is, in general, an evidential  burden  on  a  person  who
      asserts, that must be considered in the light of the  responsibilities
      of the Home Secretary in these particular circumstances as set out  in
      the law referred to  above.  Further,  the  correct  approach  to  and
      treatment of the evidence of children is one that takes properly  into
      account the characteristics of children as well as of  the  individual
      child and it is not, in general, appropriate to attribute to  a  child
      the same degree and nature of knowledge, understanding, motivation and
      basic education in relation to any given aspect of  a  case,  as  may,
      rightly or wrongly, be attributed to an  adult.  The  use  of  adverse
      credibility findings as the  method  of  exclusion  of  a  child  from
      international protection is not indicated by the guidance, and greater
      weight is to be given to background, expert and professional  evidence
      (see e.g. the UNHCR Handbook (Geneva 2000)).

18. The material referred to by Mr Halim comes from the UNHCR's  Guidelines
    on International Protection: Child Asylum Claims under  Articles  1(A)2
    and 1(F) of the 1951 Convention and/or 1967 Protocol  relating  to  the
    Status  of  Refugees  ['the  UNHCR  child  guidelines'].  The  selected
    paragraph follows:

        72. Some children may omit  or  distort  vital  information  or  be
        unable to differentiate the imagined from reality.  They  also  may
        experience difficulty relating to abstract notions, such as time or
        distance. Thus, what might constitute a lie in the case of an adult
        might not necessarily be a lie in the case of a child.

19. Mr Halim also mentions that the UNHCR child guidelines cite  a  Finnish
    Government report: this is the part selected by him

        There are also cultural differences in what kind  of  behaviour  is
        expected of a child of a particular age. In this respect there is a
        possibility of misinterpretation  of  behaviour  in  the  interview
        situation. One also has to bear in  mind  that  a  child's  outward
        behaviour and level of understanding may be in  contradiction  with
        each other. Asylum-seeking unaccompanied minors may try to  present
        a more mature role than befits  their  age  because  of  the  heavy
        responsibility of the role that is placed  on  their  shoulders  by
        their family; the child feels that he/she has to  manage  the  task
        given by the parents and will try to present  a  brave  face,  even
        though he/she may not totally grasp the  reasons  for  having  been
        sent away from the home country and is experiencing insecurity.

20. Findings of fact       The directions  given  by  Irvine  J  and  Judge
    Jarvis of course have to be treated with respect: however, it must also
    be borne in mind that

     a) they do not purport to be a final determination of any issue in the
        case, except so far as necessary  to  decide  that  the  first-tier
        judge had made an error of law, which required a fresh hearing;
     b) they were given, as long ago as January 2011, in the context of  an
        ongoing issue about the duty of the Secretary of State to trace the
        relations of unaccompanied minors, about which a good deal more has
        since been said by the higher courts;
     c) so far as they may have been intended to  include  rulings  on  the
        general approach to be taken to the credibility of an unaccompanied
        minor, they were not submitted, in the form of a final decision  or
        at all, to the Tribunal's Reporting Committee, the body  in  charge
        of regulating which decisions appear, either as  'reported'  or  as
        country guidance  decisions,  with  a  view  to  authorizing  their
        citation in other cases.

21. I do not approach the first task in  hand,  which  is  the  very  basic
    judicial one of finding the facts in issue, with any  specific  outcome
    in mind, least of all of finding a "...method of exclusion of  a  child
    from international protection". I simply have to discover the truth, so
    far as relevant, and bearing in mind the burden and standard of  proof,
    which in this case, as in all asylum appeals, is on  the  appellant  to
    persuade me that the facts on which he relies are at  least  reasonably
    likely to be true. In doing so, I shall very  much  bear  in  mind  the
    UNHCR child guidelines, and, so far as they approve them, those set out
    by the Finnish Government.

22. This appellant is an intelligent young man, whose  English  (he  hardly
    had to resort to the Tribunal interpreter at all)  do  him,  the  Skeen
    family  and  his  school  here  (from  which  he  has  a  good  report)
    considerable credit. His present language skills however are rather  by
    the way, because the main questions to be decided are

     a) where he had come from (meaning of course his  country  of  origin)
        when he arrived in this country and was interviewed back  in  March
        2010, when he was only 14ï¿½;
     b) what his  and  his  family's  history  there  had  been,  with  any
        significant developments since; and
     c) whether he now has any friends or relations to look  after  him  if
        returned there now, so far as he may still need them at 17ï¿½?

23. I have read Mr Abas's report  with  some  interest:  it  represents  an
    attempt to meet on behalf of an  appellant  the  objective  more  often
    aimed at by the familiar kind of  questionnaire  administered  in  Home
    Office interviews. The difficulty in each case is that the  information
    which vouched for the correctness of the answers is validated  only  by
    the claimed knowledge of the interviewer. While Mr Abas may  very  well
    know very much more about Afghanistan  from  personal  experience  than
    most, if not all Home Office interviewers, he  gives  no  more  details
    about his own life there than the engineering degree he took  in  Kabul
    in 1981, and his service at the Foreign Ministry there from 1983 -  89.
    As for any published sources, with one minor exception, there are none.



24. In my view Mr Abas's claim to be considered  as  an  expert  on  things
    Afghan generally is something which ought not to be taken for  granted,
    certainly till his expertise has been tested by subjecting  himself  to
    cross-examination, and perhaps considered in a 'reported  decision'.  I
    do not propose to have this decision 'reported'; but  the  Home  Office
    may cite it in any appeal where these or any other solicitors  seek  to
    rely on Mr Abas, or anyone in a similar position, without  calling  him
    to give oral evidence. The evidential  basis  Mr  Abas  gives  for  the
    appellant's language skills, one of the few points where his experience
    as an interpreter does suggest he can be regarded as an expert witness,
    is particularly sparse.

25. Having said that, I see no reason not to accept Mr Abas's view  on  the
    individual case in hand, to the extent that this  appellant  does  come
    from Afghanistan. So far as I  can  verify  the  information  from  his
    validation of the appellant's answers from my own  judicial  experience
    and general knowledge, which I can for Qs. 29, 33 - 34, and  38  -  41,
    those do all seem to be correct, though I question how far the names of
    the days of the  week  may  be  unique  to  Afghanistan.  That  decides
    question (a) in the appellant's favour.

26. Questions (b) and (c) may be taken together, in the light of my  answer
    to  question  (a).  Mr  Halim  urged  on  me  the  consistency  of  the
    appellant's answers in giving his history at different times: certainly
    the  information  he  has  provided  has   contained   no   significant
    inconsistencies. However,  the  more  salient  question  in  this  case
    involves what the appellant has not   said:  in  turning  to  this,  of
    course I do very much bear in mind his age at the relevant times.

27. Dealing with the points on which the appellant  was  cross-examined  in
    the order already set out, I shall start  with  7.  When  he  says  the
    events which led him to leave Afghanistan took place, the appellant was
    a boy of no more than 12ï¿½. With that in mind, I should not regard it as
    unreasonable for him not to have any detailed or precise  knowledge  of
    his father's work as an interpreter. What does cause me difficulty with
    his case on that point is the explanation  now  given  in  his  present
    witness  statement,  taken  by  his  clearly  experienced   specialized
    solicitors, and confirmed in oral evidence by him.  There  cannot  have
    been any particular reason perceived by his father to keep the  details
    of his work from his children, when as the  appellant  acknowledged  he
    used to leave the family home for the army camp  where  he  worked,  in
    uniform for all to see.

28. Turning to 8, I accept that the appellant might well not have known the
    name of his uncle's village when he was  simply  visiting  it,  however
    regularly, with his family: as he points out, they either walked or got
    a lift, and clearly there would have been no bus,  with  or  without  a
    name on it, that he needed to look out for. On the other hand,  by  the
    time the appellant left Afghanistan, he had spent 18 months  living  at
    his uncle's, and was nearly 14. In those circumstances, I do not accept
    that he can have been unaware of the name of the village.

29. Nor do I accept that the appellant could have been unaware of the names
    of other villages in the area, since he says he  heard  people  talking
    about them. Not remembering all the names might have  been  one  thing;
    suggesting that people somehow managed to discuss the  villages,  their
    inhabitants and mosques without mentioning the names of  the  locations
    involved is quite another. I do not know, nor is there any evidence  as
    to whether mosques in rural Afghanistan are referred to  by  individual
    names, as opposed to those of the villages where they stand[2]; and  so
    I do not set any store by the appellant's failure to give the  name  of
    his.  However  I  do  not  accept  that  the  appellant,  at  14ï¿½  when
    interviewed, would have been incapable of mentioning  that  his  school
    had been in the same village where he lived.

30. The last point is  of  less  importance  in  itself;  but  the  general
    difficulty is  that  this  appellant  has  in  my  view  shown  himself
    reluctant to give information, which might  be  verifiable,  about  his
    home  village  and  surrounding  area.  This  difficulty   comes   into
    particularly sharp relief with the points raised at 10  -  11.  I  have
    already given my view that this appellant is a very  intelligent  young
    man, and he must be well able to understand the importance of getting a
    favourable answer to my question (c), in terms of  the  effect  of  the
    authorities on the  treatment  of  unaccompanied  minors,  particularly
    those from Afghanistan.

31. While the primary duty was on the Home Office to trace any relations he
    might have in his country of origin, and despite the disclaimer on  the
    Red Cross letters, the appellant's solicitors  quite  sensibly  advised
    him to make a tracing request for those  of  his  relations  who  might
    still be alive. None of the Red Cross letters mentions any  other  name
    than that of the appellant's brother Mustafa: the appellant said in his
    oral evidence that, on his solicitors' advice, he also  gave  them  the
    name of his maternal uncle.

32. I do not set any store by the appellant's apparent failure  to  mention
    his brother Abubakar, as well as Mustafa: it would not have  been  easy
    for the Red Cross to trace a boy of that  age,  and  someone  like  the
    appellant might well have thought it would add nothing to name him. Nor
    do I see any particular significance in the appellant's denial that  he
    had given a date of birth for Mustafa: it is  possible  that  he  could
    have forgotten doing so.

33. However, the name of the appellant's village would have  been  such  an
    elementary piece of information that I do not accept that, even at just
    under 15 when the Red Cross  inquiries  started,  he  would  have  been
    unable to give it. Even  if  that  had  been  so,  he  knows  the  name
    (Chaharbagh) perfectly well now, and has  not  suggested  that  he  had
    forgotten it and then remembered it again. This  takes  me  to  what  I
    consider  the  salient  part  of  the  evidence  about  the  Red  Cross
    inquiries: see 13.

34.  On 15 February 2012 the Red Cross  sent  the  appellant  the  detailed
    letter referred to there; while  he  might  have  had  some  difficulty
    replying to their inquiries without any help at all, he  has  not  only
    had Mr Skeen and the Northamptonshire social services to turn to;  but,
    at least since 15 August last year, when they represented him  on  what
    turned out to be an abortive hearing, the services of  his  experienced
    specialist solicitors. They have produced the Red Cross  letters;  but,
    though Mr Halim chose  in  his  skeleton  argument  (paragraph  21)  to
    present this as a case of  "... ongoing co-operation with the Red Cross
    - engaged at the A's instigation", there has been no evidence at all of
    any attempt to answer the detailed request for information which  might
    have helped in tracing the appellant's family, contained in the last of
    them.

35. While the appellant's own evidence was that he didn't know the names of
    any neighbouring villages, I have rejected that, for the reasons  given
    at 29; more importantly, he has never claimed to have forgotten, or not
    to have known the name of his own village.  I  do  not  accept  that  a
    professionally represented appellant, even one  of  his  age,  who  had
    received the letter of 15 February, could have failed to pass  on  that
    basic and vital information at any time between 15 August 2012  and  29
    May 2013, if he really didn't know where his family were, and genuinely
    wanted help in tracing them.

36. I also do not accept, for the reasons already given  at  28,  that  the
    appellant could have been unaware of the name of his  uncle's  village,
    or failed to give that too, whether his uncle was dead or  not,  if  he
    genuinely wanted to help trace his family as a whole. Nor do  I  accept
    that he could have given the Red Cross his uncle's name as  he  claims:
    they  have  been  punctilious  throughout,  as  one  would  expect,  in
    recording what information they had, and what they needed.

37. I bear in mind not only the appellant's  age,  but  the  dicta  in  the
    authorities to which Mr Halim referred me on this point (per  Neuburger
    LJ in HK [2006] EWCA Civ 1037 and per  Sedley  LJ  in  Gheisari  [2004]
    EWCA Civ 1854, both to the effect that the inherent unlikelihood of  an
    account does not mean, at least in this field, that it  is  necessarily
    untrue.  However, given this appellant's  sustained,  and  in  my  view
    deceitful attempt to present himself as all alone  in  Afghanistan,  if
    not the world, I am not prepared to accept that he is, as he claims, an
    orphan of parents murdered by the Taleban; or that  he  has  been  left
    without any relations to turn to in his home area.

38. Conclusions     Those findings of fact answer questions  (b)  and  (c),
    and decide the appeal against the appellant, so far as Refugee or Human
    Rights Convention risk on return is concerned, whether  based  on  past
    events, or (including any claim under article 15 (c), not warranted  by
    the general situation for those of the appellant's age with families to
    turn to), the appellant's current likely position in Afghanistan.  They
    also dispose of his article 8 claim, based as it is  on  what  he  says
    awaits him there. If this appeal were to succeed at all, it could  only
    be on the basis of the Home Office's admitted failure to  make  tracing
    inquiries of their own about his family.

39. There are in my view two irrefutable answers to a claim on that  basis.
    The first is a question of general principle: it could not possibly  be
    right to extend this country's protection to  someone  because  of  the
    failure of its authorities to investigate a  state  of  affairs  which,
    once known, would have disentitled him from that very thing. The second
    is firmly based on authority: while in EU (Afghanistan) & others [2013]
    EWCA Civ 32 the Court of Appeal accepted, following KA (Afghanistan)  &
    others [2012] EWCA Civ 1014, that a failure to carry out  the  duty  to
    trace might be relevant to judicial consideration of an asylum or human
    rights claim, they made it very clear, not least by their decisions  in
    the individual cases concerned, that it would  not  be  relevant  where
    carrying it out would have made no real difference. That in my view  is
    the position in the present case.
