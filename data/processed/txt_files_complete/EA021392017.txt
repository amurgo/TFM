Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The Appellant is a citizen of Brazil born  on  4  December  1966.   She
    appeals against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Geraint-Jones
    QC dated 30 April 2018 dismissing her appeal against the refusal  of  a
    residence card  under  Regulation  7(1)(c)  of  the  Immigration  (EEA)
    Regulations 2006.

2.   Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge  Grubb  on  20
    November 2018 for the following reasons:

         "The judge did not accept that the appellant was dependent  on  her
         son-in-law.  It is arguable that the judge placed excessive  weight
         upon his conclusion that the appellant had used deception by coming
         to the UK as a visitor and in doing  so  failed  to  give  adequate
         reasons why she did not accept the  evidence  of  dependency  given
         orally at the hearing.  Further, the judge also seems to have found
         that she was not dependent because it was a matter of choice rather
         than necessity.  This is arguably a misunderstanding of the concept
         of dependence in the 2006 Regulations after Lim v ECO  [2015]  EWCA
         Civ 1383."


Immigration History

3.   The Appellant arrived in the UK on or about 25  November  2015  with  a
    visit visa valid for six months. She did not leave the UK when her visa
    expired but made an application for a residence card on the basis  that
    she was an adult dependent relative in ascending line to the wife of an
    EEA citizen. Her application  was  refused  by  the  Respondent  on  25
    January  2017  on  the  basis  that  there  was  insufficient  evidence
    submitted and she had failed to  demonstrate  that  she  was  genuinely
    dependent upon her EEA family member or their spouse.


The Judge's Findings

4.   The judge summarised the oral evidence of the Appellant,  her  daughter
    and her daughter's husband at paragraphs 5 to 11 of  the  decision.  He
    then concluded at paragraph 12 onwards:

         "12. I am in no doubt that the appellant was  untruthful  when  she
             said that when she  arrived  into  this  country  it  was  her
             intention to remain here only as  a  temporary  visitor.  That
             much is clear from the witness evidence given by her  daughter
             and the appellant's own initial evidence to  the  effect  that
             when she arrived  it  was  her  intention  to  regularise  her
             position before her visa expired.


         13.  Accordingly, I find as a fact that the appellant deceived  the
             Entry Clearance Officer into granting her a  visit  visa.  The
             appellant did not intend to come here as a genuine visitor but
             intended cynically to  abuse  the  immigration  laws  of  this
             country and remain as an illegal overstayer on the basis  that
             it would provide her with the opportunity to allege  that  she
             was a dependent relative of her daughter and son-in-law.


         14.  However, the mere fact that somebody uses deceit  against  the
             immigration authorities of this  country  is  not  necessarily
             fatal to an application or an appeal, especially as there  are
             areas within immigration law  where  the  higher  courts  have
             failed to consider such conduct to be especially relevant.   I
             need not  set  out  examples  in  this  Determination  for  it
             suffices for me simply to record that the fact of such  deceit
             is not necessarily fatal."


         ...


         17.  The real issue in this appeal  is  whether  I  can  or  should
             accept the evidence given to the effect that the appellant  is
             a dependent relative of her  son-in-law  (not  her  daughter).
             Such dependence has been squarely put on the  basis  that  the
             appellant resides in the same accommodation  as  her  daughter
             and son-in-law and that  each  of  them  gives  her  ï¿½100  per
             calendar month as pocket money.


         18.  The appellant ha (sic)  initially  desisted  from  giving  any
             evidence about her personal circumstances  or  the  extent  to
             which, if any, she owns property or assets.   This  is  highly
             relevant because for somebody to  be  dependent  upon  another
             means just that.  It is not enough for a person to manufacture
             an appearance of dependency when that person would  be  or  is
             capable of maintaining herself in her home country so  as  not
             to be dependent upon the identified relative.   In  answer  to
             questions asked by me the appellant said she lived in a rented
             flat in Brazil but that she had no or no significant assets.


         19.  My starting point is that there was, as  I  find,  plainly  an
             intention  on  the  part  of  the  appellant  to  deceive  the
             immigration authorities of this country  when  she  came  here
             purportedly as a temporary visitor  notwithstanding  that,  at
             that  time,  she  had  every  intention  of   remaining   here
             permanently. I reject as untruthful her later evidence to  the
             effect that she had intended to return to Brazil but that  her
             daughter and son-in-law decided that they were concerned about
             her should she return to Brazil. I am equally  satisfied  that
             the appellant's daughter and son-in-law connived,  or  at  the
             very  least  condoned,  her  determined  deception   practised
             against the Entry Clearance Officer.


         20.  In the foregoing circumstances I must exercise  great  caution
             before I accept the evidence given by  the  appellant,  or  in
             support of her appeal,  given  that  she  has  demonstrated  a
             willingness to deceive and to give evidence which is  entirely
             self-serving and designed to procure an outcome that she wants
             to procure. When I add that to the  fact  that  the  appellant
             rather obviously desisted from giving  any  relevant  evidence
             about her circumstances whilst she lived in Brazil,  including
             details  of  her  accommodation,  employment,  savings  and/or
             connections, it leads me to concluding  that  the  appellant's
             evidence has been tailored to procure a desired outcome.


         21.  The evidence given by the appellant, her daughter and her son-
             in-law is assertive in nature and relies substantially on  the
             assertion that the appellant is provided with accommodation by
             her daughter and son-in-law.  In circumstances where I do  not
             consider the appellant to be a reliably truthful witness, I do
             not accept the implied (but not express)  assertion  that  the
             appellant would be unable to afford to house herself in Brazil
             whilst working in the kind of employment  that  she  seems  to
             have given up when she decided that she would relocate to  the
             United Kingdom.


         22.  The mere fact that the appellant resides with her daughter and
             son-in-law does not make her their dependent,  let  alone  her
             son-in-law's dependent.  Any  such  dependency  will  only  be
             established if she lives with them as a  matter  of  necessity
             rather than choice. I do not consider that  the  preponderance
             of evidence allows me to conclude that  such  residence  is  a
             matter of necessity rather than a matter of choice.  This is a
             case where, quite plainly, the appellant has decided that  she
             will reside in the United Kingdom and has laid the  ground  to
             procure her desired outcome by deceiving the  Entry  Clearance
             Officer and then  claiming  dependency  based  upon  assertion
             rather  than   a   detailed   disclosure   of   her   personal
             circumstances and assets.


         23.  For the foregoing reasons the appellant fails to  persuade  me
             that it is more probable than not that she is truly  dependent
             upon her daughter and/or son-in-law. I have little doubt  that
             it is an alleged dependency  of  convenience  to  procure  the
             outcome which the appellant wishes to procure."


Submissions

5.   Mr Bellara relied on the very detailed grounds submitted in support  of
    the application.  He submitted that the judge's comment at paragraph 15
    where he states "I have to consider  whether  the  deceitful  appellant
    meets the requirements of regulation 7(1)(c) of the  2006  Regulations"
    was unhelpful and suggested the judge had  a  degree  of  pre-judgment.
    There was no assessment of the Regulation anywhere in the decision. The
    test for dependency was that set out in Reyes [2013] UKUT 314 namely:

         "First, the test of dependency is a purely factual  test.   Second,
         the court envisages questions of dependency and must not be reduced
         to a  bare  calculation  of  financial  dependency  but  should  be
         construed broadly to involve a holistic examination of a number  of
         factors including financial, physical and social conditions, so  as
         to establish whether there  is  dependence  that  is  genuine.  The
         essential focus has  to  be  on  the  nature  of  the  relationship
         concerned and on whether it is one characterised by a situation  of
         dependence  based  on   an   examination   of   all   the   factual
         circumstances,  bearing  in  mind  the  underlying   objective   of
         maintaining the unity of the family.  It seems to us that the  need
         for a wide-ranging fact-specific approach is indeed enjoined by the
         Court of Appeal in SM (India):  see  in  particular  Sullivan  LJ's
         observations at [27]-[28].  Third, it is clear from the wording  of
         both Article 2.2 and regulation  7(1)  that  the  test  is  one  of
         present not past dependency. Both  provisions  employ  the  present
         tense.  Fourth (and this may have relevance to what  is  understood
         by present dependency), interpretation of the meaning of  the  term
         must be such as not to deprive the provision of its effectiveness."

6.   Mr Bellara submitted that the issue in  this  appeal  was  whether  the
    Appellant could accommodate and support herself and this had  not  been
    addressed by the First-tier Tribunal Judge. She had not  desisted  from
    giving evidence about her finances as stated by the judge and he failed
    to apply the guidance in Lim v Entry Clearance Officer [2015] EWCA  Civ
    which states:

         "The critical question is whether the claimant  is  in  fact  in  a
         position to support himself or not, and Reyes now makes that  clear
         beyond doubt in my view. That is a simple matter of  fact.   If  he
         can support himself there is no dependency, even  if  he  is  given
         financial material support by  the  EU  citizen.  Those  additional
         resources are not necessary to enable him to meet his basic  needs.
         If, on the other hand, he  cannot  support  himself  from  his  own
         resources, the court will not  ask  why  that  is  the  case,  save
         perhaps where there is an abuse of rights. The fact that he chooses
         not to get a job  and  become  self-supporting  is  irrelevant.  It
         follows that on the facts of this case there was no dependency. The
         appellant had the funds to support herself.   She  was  financially
         independent and did not  need  the  additional  resources  for  the
         purpose of meeting her basic needs."

7.   Mr Bellara submitted that the judge focused on  the  discrepancy  given
    in oral evidence but failed to refer to Lim or Reyes in  the  decision.
    This was essential to show that the judge had  considered  the  general
    guidance. In Lim  a  potential  ability  to  support  oneself  was  not
    determinative. It was a question of real  dependency  and  whether  the
    Appellant was able to  support  herself.  This  was  missing  from  the
    decision. The judge failed  to  address  whether  the  Appellant  could
    support herself without assistance from her family.

8.   On behalf of the Respondent, Ms Brocklesby-Weller  submitted  that  the
    Appellant had failed to discharge the burden of proof.  The  judge  was
    entitled to  make  credibility  findings  and  he  adopted  a  holistic
    approach to the evidence. He acknowledged at paragraph 14  that  deceit
    was not fatal to the application but found that the Appellant's failure
    to detail her  personal  circumstances  and  provide  evidence  of  her
    finances meant that she had failed to show real dependency.  The  judge
    correctly identified the issue at paragraph 17 of the decision  and  at
    paragraph 18 found that there  was  a  complete  lack  of  evidence  of
    personal assets. At paragraph 19 the judge found that given the lack of
    credibility and lack of other objective  evidence  of  the  Appellant's
    circumstances the oral testimony in itself was insufficient to  satisfy
    the  Regulations.   The  Appellant  had  dis-ingenuine  intentions  and
    therefore the judge was entitled to treat the rest of her evidence with
    circumspection. The Appellant has said she would return to Brazil which
    suggests she had a life to return to. The judge did not accept that she
    was unable to pay rent given her claim that she intended to return. The
    judge identified these two factors as the reasons for why her testimony
    was rejected and, at paragraph 23, the judge put all  factors  together
    in concluding that the dependency was not real.

9.   In relation to  paragraph  22,  Ms  Brocklesby-Weller  submitted  that,
    although it may contain an erroneous sentence, it did not amount  to  a
    misdirection in law. She accepted that the Appellant's  dependency  did
    not have to be that of  necessity  but  one  of  real  dependency.  She
    submitted that it was apparent, when paragraph 22 was read  in  context
    with the judge's other findings, that he did not accept the Appellant's
    oral evidence for a number of reasons and there was no  other  evidence
    of her personal circumstances or financial assets.   Given  that  there
    was  no  independent  evidence  other  than  the  oral  testimony,  his
    rejection of her oral evidence meant that the Appellant had  failed  to
    show that she was dependent upon her son-in-law for her basic needs and
    she did not have funds to be able to support herself.

10.  In response to these submissions, Mr  Bellara  submitted  that  it  was
    clear from paragraph 22 that the judge  had  applied  the  wrong  legal
    test, the error was material and the decision should be  set  aside.  A
    failure to properly apply Lim was the basis upon which  permission  was
    granted and  it  was  clear  from  paragraph  22  that  the  judge  had
    misdirected himself in law.


Discussion and Conclusions

11.  On reading the decision as a whole I am satisfied that  the  judge  did
    not pre-judge the issue and his conclusion that the Appellant had  been
    deceitful was open to him on  the  evidence  before  him.  The  judge's
    approach was consistent with AK (Failure to assess witnesses' evidence)
    Turkey [2004] UKIAT 00230 which was relied on in the grounds of appeal.



12.  The judge assessed the evidence of all three witnesses at paragraphs  5
    to 11 and found  that  the  Appellant  had  lied  to  the  ECO  in  her
    application for a visit visa. His reasons for coming to this conclusion
    were set out at paragraphs 12 to 14.

13.  Having found  that  the  witnesses  were  not  reliable  and  that  the
    Appellant was deceitful in her previous application the judge then went
    on to assess whether he could accept the evidence of dependency.  There
    were no documents to support the assertion made by all three  witnesses
    that the Appellant was dependent on  her  son-in-law.  The  judge  gave
    adequate reasons for why he could not accept the oral evidence on  this
    point,  namely  the  Appellant   had   not   disclosed   her   personal
    circumstances in Brazil in her witness statement and  no  evidence  was
    led on this in examination-in-chief.

14.  I reject Mr Bellara's submission that the judge should  have  put  this
    point to the Appellant if it was of some concern to him. I  am  of  the
    view that it is not for the judge to cross-examine a  witness  but  for
    the Appellant to discharge the burden upon her of providing evidence to
    prove, on the balance of probabilities, that she was dependent  on  her
    son-in-law. She has simply failed to provide any evidence,  other  than
    her assertion given in her oral testimony, to show that the  dependency
    was real and genuine.  A further  reason  is  that  the  Appellant  had
    employed deceit to obtain a visit visa and her daughter and  son-in-law
    at the very least  had  condoned  such  action.   These  were  adequate
    reasons for not accepting the oral testimony of the three witnesses and
    for finding that their evidence could not be relied upon.

15.  Paragraphs 21  and  22  make  it  clear  that  there  was  insufficient
    evidence of dependency.  The oral evidence was unreliable  and  in  the
    absence of any other evidence the Appellant  had  failed  to  show  she
    satisfied  the  Regulations.  The  judge  assessed  credibility,   then
    addressed the Regulations and gave adequate reasons for  concluding  at
    paragraph 23 that the Appellant's dependency on her son-in-law was  not
    genuine.

16.  Although the judge did not refer to Lim or Reyes he did apply the  test
    therein. The sentence in paragraph 22 which states "Any such dependency
    will only be established  if  she  lives  with  them  as  a  matter  of
    necessity rather than choice" was not material  when  the  decision  is
    read as a whole. The judge focused on the nature  of  the  relationship
    and whether it was characterised by a situation of dependence based  on
    all the circumstances of the case. The Appellant had not shown that she
    was not in a position to support herself.  She had not shown that  ï¿½100
    was necessary to enable her to meet her basic needs  and  she  had  not
    shown that she did not have funds  in  order  to  be  able  to  support
    herself because she failed to provide sufficient evidence  of  her  own
    resources.

17.  I find that the judge's finding, that the  evidence  of  the  Appellant
    and her witnesses was not reliable, was open to  him  on  the  evidence
    before him and he gave adequate reasons for coming to that  conclusion.
    Given the lack  of  any  documentary  evidence  to  support  this  oral
    testimony, his conclusion that the  Appellant  had  failed  to  provide
    sufficient evidence to show that she satisfied  Regulation  7(1)(c)  of
    the 2006 Regulations was open to the judge on the evidence before  him.
    The judge properly directed himself in  law  and  a  failure  to  refer
    specifically to relevant authorities was not material in this case. The
    judge had applied the correct test to the facts as he  found  them  and
    there was no error of law in his decision to dismiss the appeal.

18.  Accordingly, I find that there was no  error  of  law  in  the  judge's
    decision dated 30 April 2018 and I dismiss the Appellant's appeal.
