                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge M Symes, promulgated on 22nd April 2015, following a  hearing  at
    Richmond on 13th March 2015.  In the determination, the  judge  allowed
    the appeal of ND.  The  Respondent  Secretary  of  State,  subsequently
    applied for, and  was  granted,  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.



The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a male, a citizen of Brazil, who was born on  2nd  May
    1973.  He appeals against the decision of the  Secretary  of  State  to
    refuse further leave to remain and issue directions against  him  under
    Section 47 of the IANA 2006 in a decision made on 21st August 2014.

The Appellant's Claim

 3. The Appellant's claim is that the  Appellant  had  married  his  former
    fianc�e, AH, a British citizen by birth.  She  was  in  full-time  work
    with a garden centre group.  She earned �14,000 as  a  sales  assistant
    and waitress per annum.  She had savings of �41,350.  She owned a flat.
     Yet, the application had been refused for his right to remain  in  the
    UK on the  basis  that,  although  he  had  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    relationship with AH, he could not show that his sponsoring wife earned
    an income above �18,600, as required by the Immigration Rules.

The Judge's Findings

 4. The judge heard evidence from SH, the sponsoring wife's mother, who had
    said  that  she  had  encouraged  them  to  resolve   the   Appellant's
    immigration status by leaving the  country  and  returning  with  entry
    clearance.  The sponsoring wife herself gave evidence to say  that  she
    would face hardship in Brazil because she could not speak the  language
    there.  She did not want to leave the UK for a long period because  she
    was working here and she had always worked.  She  would  also  find  it
    very difficult to be separated from her mother because her mother drank
    heavily and had a problem with alcoholism.  She had a  sister  but  her
    sister suffered from bipolar disorder for which she was thus  receiving
    treatment and she was in no position to look after  the  ailing  mother
    (see paragraphs 13 to 14).

 5. The judge observed that it had become apparent that the Appellant could
    not satisfy  the  financial  requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules,
    although all other aspects of the Rules  were  satisfied,  because  the
    sponsoring wife's admissible earnings were  only  �3,000,  and  because
    additional rental income of  �650  monthly  could  not  make  good  the
    shortfall, even  taken  with  her  savings,  which  had  been  slightly
    diminished by her giving her mother over �5,000 to invest in an ISA for
    her (see paragraph 20).  The appeal would also fail under the five year
    route (see paragraph 21).

 6. Therefore, what the judge was left with was a consideration of the case
    outside the  Rules.   He  gave  consideration  to  whether  there  were
    "exceptional  circumstances"  and  whether  there   were   "compelling"
    circumstances such as to  produce  "unjustifiably  harsh  consequences"
    which would outweigh the public interest.  He gave consideration to the
    leading authorities on this matter (see paragraph 22).  The judge  went
    on to hold that, "It is perfectly clear that family life is established
    in this case.  The Appellant and his  Sponsor  are  in  a  genuine  and
    subsisting relationship.   This  relationship  was  of  several  years'
    duration".  He concluded that it

         "Has already endured through  a  period  where  both  lived  abroad
         whilst he sought entry clearance.  It is clear that  the  Sponsor's
         family life with her vulnerable mother would be compromised if  she
         left the country: the fact that she has done so  previously  hardly
         diminishes the strain that will be put on her  mother  and  sister.
         If anything it worsens it" (paragraph 23).

 7. Looking at the situation outside  the  Rules,  the  judge  went  on  to
    observe that the application had failed for reasons that were

         "Essentially technical: not because the Sponsor in fact lacked  the
         relevant income, but because their earnings could not be  evidenced
         via the strict requirements under  Appendix  FM-SE,  for  technical
         rather than substantive reasons" (paragraph 26).

 8. Curiously, however, the judge then concluded that, "The appeal  against
    refusal to vary leave to remain is allowed under the Immigration Rules"
    (see page 7).

Grounds of Application

 9. The grounds of the application state that the judge  found  that  there
    were no insurmountable obstacles to  the  Appellant  continuing  family
    life  outside  the  UK.   However,  the  Rules   remain   substantially
    unsatisfied.

10. On 15th June 2015, permission to appeal was granted.

Submissions

11. At the hearing before me,  Mr  Kandola,  appearing  on  behalf  of  the
    Respondent Secretary of State, stated that he would place reliance upon
    paragraphs 20 to 21 of the determination because these  make  it  quite
    clear that the Appellant could not satisfy the  financial  requirements
    and could also not succeed under the five  year  route.   However,  the
    judge had not been able to show why the Appellant succeeded  under  the
    human rights grounds either.

12. For her part, Ms Fielden submitted that the judge plainly  intended  to
    allow  the  appeal  outside  the  Immigration  Rules  because,   having
    concluded at paragraphs 20 and 21 that the Appellant could not  succeed
    under the Immigration Rules, he then went on at  paragraph  22  to  say
    that, "That leaves the case outside the Rules".  Consideration was then
    given to the position outside the Rules with references to "exceptional
    circumstances", and to "unjustifiably  harsh  consequences".   He  said
    that these outweighed the public interest in this case.  The  fact  was
    that the mother had a  problem  with  alcoholism.   She  was  seriously
    dependent on the sponsoring daughter.  The other daughter  had  medical
    problems and was in no position to assist.

13. Moreover, at paragraph 23, the judge sets out the considerations as  to
    why the appeal succeeds outside the Immigration Rules given that  there
    is  a  genuine  and  subsisting  relationship  and,  given   that   the
    relationship has endured through a period of life  lived  abroad,  with
    now added strains to having to envisage that situation again  were  the
    Appellant and his sponsoring wife to leave to go to Brazil once more.

14. In reply, Mr Kandola submitted that the fact was that Appendix  FM  and
    EX.1 were not satisfied.  There were no insurmountable obstacles.  This
    is because the Appellant and his sponsoring wife had already  lived  in
    Brazil.   Secondly,   under   Section   117B,   the   public   interest
    considerations were such  that  the  Appellants  were  not  financially
    independent.

15. At the end of the submissions, I asked both representatives to indicate
    what remedy they were seeking of this Tribunal.  Both agreed that given
    the confusion in the manner in which the appeal had been  allowed,  the
    appropriate course of action was for this Tribunal to remit the  matter
    back to the First-tier Tribunal, to be heard  by  a  judge  other  than
    Judge Symes.

Error of Law

16. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by the judge did involve
    the making of an error on a point of law (see  Section  12(1)  of  TCEA
    2007) such that I should set aside the decision.  In what is  otherwise
    a comprehensive and thorough determination, with detailed consideration
    being given to the leading authorities on  the  financial  requirements
    attests, and the  principle  of  "exceptional  circumstances",  and  of
    "unjustifiably harsh  consequences",  the  judge  nevertheless,  causes
    confusion at the end in  allowing  the  appeal  under  the  Immigration
    Rules.  Yet, the judge had earlier concluded that, "It became  apparent
    that the Appellant could not satisfy the financial requirements of  the
    Immigration Rules ..." (paragraph 20).

Remaking the Decision

17. I have remade the decision on the basis of the findings of the original
    judge, the evidence before him, and the submissions that I  have  heard
    today.  I am allowing this  appeal  only  to  the  extent  that  it  is
    remitted back to a Judge of the First-tier Tribunal, other  than  Judge
    Symes.  My reasons are as follows.

18. Whereas it is clear that the judge makes clear  that  the  judge  makes
    important  findings  of  fact,  namely  that  this  is  a  genuine  and
    subsisting relationship, and also observes that the Appellant could not
    meet the technical requirements of the Rules, although funds did exist,
    and whilst the judge is absolutely right in noting Lord  Bingham's  oft
    forgotten statement in EB (Kosovo) [2008] UKHL  41  (at  paragraph  12)
    that,

         "It will rarely be proportionate to uphold an order for removal  of
         a spouse if there is a close and genuine bond with the other spouse
         and that spouse cannot reasonably be expected to follow the removed
         spouse to the  country  of  removal",  (see  paragraph  28  of  the
         determination),

    the fact is that these matters must now be considered in the context of
    the Court of Appeal's judgment in Agyarko [2015] EWCA  Civ  440,  which
    defines how "insurmountable obstacles" must be approached as  a  matter
    of law.  I am perfectly aware, that the judge was of the view that,

         "It is clear that the Sponsor's family  life  with  her  vulnerable
         mother would be compromised if she left the country: the fact  that
         she has done so previously hardly diminishes a strain that it  will
         put  on  her  mother  and  sister.   If  anything  it  worsens  it"
         (paragraph 23).

    Nevertheless, regard  must  be  given  to  Agyarko  in  any  subsequent
    determination of the issues.  Accordingly, whereas I direct  that  this
    matter  go  before  another  judge  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  all
    favourable findings of fact are  to  be  preserved  in  favour  of  the
    Appellant.

Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an  error  of
law such that it falls to be set aside.  I set aside  the  decision  of  the
original judge.  I remake the decision as follows.  This appeal is  remitted
to the First-tier Tribunal to be heard by a judge  other  than  Judge  Symes
with all favourable findings to be preserved.  The  Appellant's  Counsel  is
to provide a skeleton argument; and any new evidence is to be submitted  two
weeks before the hearing, the financial evidence is  to  be  updated;  there
are to be four witnesses, and the matter is to be set down for three  hours.
 The hearing centre is to be Hatton Cross.

No anonymity direction is made.
