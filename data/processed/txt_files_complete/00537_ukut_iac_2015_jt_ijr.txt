R (on the application of JT) v Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department
(s.94B NIAA 2002 certification) IJR [2015] UKUT 00537 (IAC)




                     The Queen on the application of JT
                           (ANONYMITY ORDER MADE)
                                                                   applicant


                                   versus




                 Secretary of State for the Home Department
                                                                  respondent




                      Before Upper Tribunal Judge Gill


Having considered  all  documents  lodged  and  having  heard  the  parties'
respective representatives, Ms B Asanovic of Counsel instructed  by  M  &  K
Solicitors on behalf  of  the  Applicant  and  Mr  J  Anderson  of  Counsel,
instructed by the Government Legal Department on behalf  of  the  Respondent
at a hearing at Field House on 10 August 2015


1.    The strength or otherwise of an underlying Article 8 case is  relevant
    to a decision by the respondent whether to certify a case  under  s.94B
    of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002,  in  that  it  may
    disclose a case without a specific case being advanced by the applicant
    as to why temporary separation whilst an appeal is pursued from  abroad
    may lead to a real risk of serious irreversible harm.

2.    In passing s.94B into  law,  Parliament  has  plainly  and  unarguably
    envisaged the possibility of family members, including children,  being
    separated from the individual being  removed  for  a  temporary  period
    whilst an appeal is pursued from abroad  as  well  as  the  possibility
    that, in some cases, appeals  pursued  abroad  will  succeed.  It  also
    envisaged  the  possibility  of  some   appeals   from   abroad   after
    certification under s.94B succeeding under Article 8. It is not  enough
    for an individual resisting removal  pursuant  to  certification  under
    s.94B merely to rely upon general assertions of the impact of temporary
    separation from family  members  including  children.   There  must  be
    specific engagement with the reasons why it is said  that  there  is  a
    real risk of serious irreversible harm during such  temporary  absence,
    particularly if the underlying substantive claim does not on  its  face
    raise the possibility that the impact on the  family  members  will  be
    beyond what one may generally assume will be  the  impact  when  family
    members are separated.

3.    The judgment of the majority of the European Court of Human Rights  in
    De Souza Ribeiro v France (Application No.22689/07) - HEJUD [2012] ECHR
    2066 did not state in terms that  a  suspensive  remedy  was  necessary
    whenever a claim is not manifestly ill-founded in relation  to  Article
    8. What the  majority  spoke  of  was  the  need  to  have  "sufficient
    procedural safeguards and thoroughness by an appropriate domestic forum
    offering  adequate  guarantees  of  independence   and   impartiality".
    Judicial  review  proceedings  are  such  an   appropriate   procedural
    safeguard.


Decision by Upper Tribunal Judge Gill:

      1.    The application for a stay of the proceedings  pending  judgment
                following the grant by the Court of Appeal of permission  in
                R (Byndloss and others)  v  SSHD  [2015]  EWCA  Civ  678  is
                refused.
      2.    The application for  permission  to  bring  judicial  review  is
                                 refused.

 1. The applicant is a national of  Sri  Lanka.   He  seeks  permission  to
    challenge the lawfulness of a decision of the  respondent  of  2  March
    2015 to refuse his Article 8 human rights claim and to certify it under
    s.94B[1] of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (the "2002
    Act").  If I am not minded to grant permission, Ms  Asanovic  requested
    that I stay these proceedings pending judgment following the  grant  of
    permission by the Court of Appeal in R (on the application of  Byndloss
    and another v SSHD) [2015] EWCA Civ 678.

 2. The effect of the certification under s. 94B is that the applicant  may
    only pursue an appeal after he has left the United Kingdom.

 3. The decision of 2 March 2015 followed the making of a deportation order
    on 20 February 2015 under s.32(1) of the UK Borders Act 2007 (the "2007
    Act") on the ground that the applicant was  a  foreign  criminal.   The
    criminal conviction which precipitated  the  deportation  order  was  a
    conviction on 4 September 2013 at the  Central  Criminal  Court  of  an
    offence of violent disorder for which the applicant was sentenced to  a
    period of three and a half years' imprisonment.

 4. The applicant was remanded in custody on 10 May 2013.  He was convicted
    and sentenced on 4 September  2013.   He  was  taken  into  immigration
    detention on  7  February  2015.   He  was  released  from  immigration
    detention on 27 May 2015.  Accordingly, he was on remand, in prison  or
    in detention for a total period of two  years.   At  the  time  of  his
    release from immigration detention, his child was 9 years old.

 5. The immigration history is  as  follows.   The  applicant  entered  the
    United  Kingdom  illegally  and  claimed  asylum  when  encountered  in
    December 1999.  His claim was refused and he was  served  with  illegal
    entry papers on 10 May 2001.  His appeal rights  were  exhausted  on  5
    July 2005.  He made an application under the Assisted Voluntary  Return
    Scheme to return to Sri Lanka.  That application was  approved  and  he
    was removed to Sri Lanka in July 2005.  He then made an application for
    entry clearance as the spouse of a British citizen, a marriage that was
    entered into at a time when he had no  right  to  live  in  the  United
    Kingdom permanently.  His application for entry clearance  was  refused
    but his appeal against that decision was allowed.  He was then  granted
    entry clearance following which he returned to the UK on 17 July  2007.
    On 14 September 2009, he was granted indefinite leave to remain.

 6. In the decision letter dated 2 March 2015, the respondent took the view
    that the applicant had been lawfully present in the UK for a period  of
    six years one month as at the date of the  conviction  on  4  September
    2013.

 7. The applicant's criminal history is set out in full in the reasons  for
    the decision.  The applicant has several convictions beginning from May
    2001.  The decision letter shows that he has nine convictions for about
    fifteen offences of which the most serious  was  the  conviction  of  4
    September 2013.

 8. In the decision letter, the respondent accepted that the applicant  had
    a genuine and subsisting relationship with his British  citizen  spouse
    and child.  The child was born in the UK in April 2006.  The respondent
    considered  her  duty  under  s.55  of  the  Borders,  Citizenship  and
    Immigration Act 2009. She accepted  that  the  child  was  sufficiently
    integrated within British society and  that  it  may  be  in  her  best
    interests to remain  in  the  UK.   However,  she  concluded  that  the
    exceptions in paragraphs 399 and 399A of the Statement  of  Changes  in
    the Immigration Rules HC 395 (as amended) (the "IRs") did not apply and
    that there were no "very compelling circumstances" over and above those
    described in paragraphs 399 and 399A.

 9. I shall now summarise the reasons for the decision. The respondent  did
    not accept that it would be unduly harsh for the child to live  in  Sri
    Lanka as she considered that  the  applicant  who  she  considered  had
    sufficient awareness of the linguistic, cultural and  social  norms  of
    Sri Lanka could support the child to adapt to life in  Sri  Lanka.  She
    did not accept that it would be unduly harsh for the child to remain in
    the UK even if the applicant were to be deported. Although she accepted
    that the child was dependent on the applicant, she did not accept  that
    the child was primarily dependent upon him  for  her  financial  needs,
    subsistence or accommodation which the respondent considered  had  been
    "readily provided" by the child's mother (the applicant's spouse) prior
    to the applicant's imprisonment.   She  therefore  concluded  that  the
    exception in paragraph 399(a) did not apply.

10. In relation to  the  applicant's  relationship  with  his  spouse,  the
    respondent considered  that  the  applicant's  spouse  was  not  wholly
    dependent on the applicant for accommodation, subsistence  and  finance
    as  the  respondent  considered  she  had  demonstrated   through   her
    employment and other matters referred to at  page  7  of  the  decision
    letter.  She accepted that the applicant had demonstrated a  degree  of
    dependence on his wife.  She did not accept that their relationship was
    formed at a time when the applicant was in the UK lawfully or during  a
    time when his immigration status was not precarious.  This was  because
    she considered that the documentation submitted demonstrated  that  the
    marriage had been entered into prior to the applicant having any lawful
    leave in the United Kingdom.  She did  not  accept  that  it  would  be
    unduly harsh for the applicant's wife to live in Sri Lanka or  that  it
    would be unduly harsh for her to remain in the United Kingdom whilst he
    was  abroad  given  that  in  the  respondent's  view  the   wife   had
    demonstrated  a  high  degree   of   independence   having   undertaken
    responsibilities for accommodation, finance and  subsistence  for  both
    herself and her child.

11. The respondent then considered the wife's mental health  problems.   It
    was  said  that  she  suffered  from  poor  concentration,   difficulty
    sleeping, low mood and being anxious and  tired.   While  she  accepted
    that support provided for  by  the  social  services  could  not  be  a
    substitute for the physical and emotional support  that  the  applicant
    would be  able  to  give  his  wife  as  a  husband,  she  nevertheless
    considered that the family would be effectively supported and cared for
    in the United Kingdom  through  the  social  services.   She  therefore
    concluded that the exception in paragraph 399(b) did not apply.

12. She went on  to  consider  the  right  to  private  life  exception  in
    paragraph 399A.  No issues have been raised on the  applicant's  behalf
    in relation to this aspect of the respondent's assessment. Accordingly,
    I shall not summarise the respondent's reasons for concluding that this
    exception did not apply.

13. The decision letter also deals with other aspects  of  the  applicant's
    case, such as his Article 3 claim based on his medical condition. These
    matters have not been relied in the grounds or in submissions before me
    in relation to the challenge to the s. 94B certification.

14. The applicant's case concerning the respondent's  decision  to  certify
    his case under s.94B may be summarised as follows.

15. Firstly, reliance is placed upon the judgment of the  Strasbourg  Court
    in De Souza Ribeiro v France (Application No.22689/07) -  HEJUD  [2012]
    ECHR 2066.  In particular, reliance is placed upon paragraphs 82 and 83
    of the judgment  of  the  majority.   In  considering  Article  8,  the
    majority said that, at paragraph 83:

          "... it is not imperative in order for a remedy  to  be  effective
         that it should have automatic suspensive effect.  Nevertheless,  in
         immigration  matters,  where  there  is  an  arguable  claim   that
         expulsion threatens to interfere with the alien's right to  respect
         for his private and family life, Article  13  in  conjunction  with
         Article  8  of  the  Convention  requires  that  States  must  make
         available to the individual concerned the effective possibility  of
         challenging the deportation or refusal-of-residence  order  and  of
         having the relevant  issues  examined  with  sufficient  procedural
         safeguards  and  thoroughness  by  an  appropriate  domestic  forum
         offering adequate guarantees of independence and impartiality...."

16. Although the majority did not state that a suspensive  remedy  must  be
    given in Article 8 cases, Ms Asanovic relied upon the opinion of Judges
    Pinto De Albuquerque and Vu?ini? stating, inter alia:

         "... When the  case  is  not  manifestly  ill-founded,  a  stay  of
         execution of the appealed decision is called for by the very nature
         of the review proceedings.   In  other  words,  either  the  appeal
         against an expulsion or removal order is manifestly ill-founded and
         therefore the reviewing authority is  in  a  position  to  take  an
         immediate decision on it, making the suspension of the  effects  of
         the  appealed  expulsion  order  otiose:  or  the  appeal  is   not
         manifestly ill-founded and a refusal  of  suspensive  effect  could
         seriously  compromise  the  very  aim  of   the   judicial   review
         proceedings and deprive the guarantee provided to the appellant  of
         its meaning...."

17. Ms Asanovic submitted that it is at least arguable, taking the opinions
    of Judges Pinto De Albuquerque and Vu?ini? together with  the  majority
    decision, that the appropriate test in relation to the phrase  'serious
    irreversible harm' in s.94B is whether there is an arguable  Article  8
    claim.  She also relied upon the judgment of the  Strasbourg  Court  in
    Nunez v Norway reported at [2011]  ECHR  1047.   In  that  case,  as  a
    consequence of  an  exclusion  order,  the  children  of  the  claimant
    affected by the decision would have been separated  from  their  mother
    for a period of two years because that was the  period  for  which  the
    exclusion order against the claimant  applied.   The  court  considered
    that there was a breach of Article 8 in that case.

18. In my judgment, it is unarguable that the opinions of Judges  Pinto  De
    Albuquerque and Vu?ini? in the Ribeiro case set the test  for  deciding
    when it is unlawful for the Secretary of State to certify a case  under
    s.94B.  In the first place, this was the view  of  two  judges  from  a
    panel of seventeen judges in total who decided the case.  The  majority
    did not state in terms that a suspensive remedy was necessary  whenever
    a claim is not manifestly ill-founded in relation to Article  8.   What
    the majority spoke of was  the  need  to  have  "sufficient  procedural
    safeguards and thoroughness by an appropriate domestic  forum  offering
    adequate guarantees of independence and impartiality".   The  views  of
    the majority of fifteen judges are to be preferred over the minority of
    two judges.

19. These judicial review proceedings are unarguably  such  an  appropriate
    procedural safeguard.  Ms Asanovic accepted that,  speaking  generally,
    judicial review proceedings are an adequate remedy. In my view, that is
    also unarguably so even in cases of certification under s.94B.  If,  in
    an individual case, there is  evidence  of  serious  irreversible  harm
    during the period of temporary absence whilst  the  appeal  is  pursued
    abroad which the respondent has not considered or if she has materially
    erred in law in her consideration of the evidence before her and  there
    will be a real risk of serious irreversible harm, then judicial  review
    proceedings will be available to the claimant in question.

20. The reality is  that,  in  passing  this  legislation,  Parliament  has
    plainly and unarguably envisaged the  possibility  of  family  members,
    including children, being separated from the individual  being  removed
    for a temporary period whilst an appeal is pursued from abroad as  well
    as the possibility that, in some cases,  appeals  pursued  abroad  will
    succeed. It also envisaged the possibility of some appeals from  abroad
    after certification under s.94B succeeding under Article 8.

21. Nunez can be distinguished on the ground that there  was  an  exclusion
    order in that case for two years with the result that the parent  could
    not return within the period of the exclusion order.  I agree  with  Mr
    Anderson that the current case is unarguably different.  The  applicant
    may return if he wins his appeal.

22. Secondly, reliance has been placed on the strength  of  the  underlying
    case to demonstrate  that  the  decision  to  certify  under  s.94B  is
    arguably unlawful.  However, in the  decision  letter,  the  respondent
    considered  the  substantive  claim  before  she  turned  to  the  s.94
    certification issue as is clear from my summary of the decision letter.
    In relation to the substantive claim, she considered the case  advanced
    by the applicant in considerable detail.  The grounds assert  that  the
    applicant has an arguable Article 8 claim before a Judge of the  First-
    tier Tribunal but they make no attempt to argue that the respondent has
    omitted  any  relevant  consideration  or  considered  facts  that  are
    irrelevant.  Nothing was said by Ms Asanovic in  this  respect  at  the
    hearing.

23. In my view,  it  is  plain  that  the  strength  or  otherwise  of  the
    underlying case is relevant to a decision by the respondent whether  to
    certify a case under s.94B, in that, it may disclose a case  without  a
    specific case being advanced by  the  applicant  as  to  why  temporary
    separation whilst an appeal is pursued from abroad may lead to  a  real
    risk  of  serious  irreversible  harm.   Thus,  the  approach  of   the
    respondent in considering the  substantive  Article  8  case  first  is
    unarguably correct.

24. In assessing the strength of the underlying  Article  8  claim  in  the
    context of the exceptions in paragraphs 399(a) and (b) and 399A of  the
    IRs, the respondent did unarguably consider the best interests  of  the
    applicant's child.  The grounds do not contend otherwise.

25. Having considered the substantive case, the respondent then  considered
    whether there was a real risk  of  serious  irreversible  harm  if  the
    applicant is removed and during the period of  his  absence  whilst  he
    pursued an appeal. Generally speaking at this point, I accept that  the
    respondent would be required to consider any  evidence  that  has  been
    presented to her that there would  be  such  a  real  risk  of  serious
    irreversible harm if removal were to take place pending the outcome  of
    any appeal.  If such evidence is presented and it relates to  children,
    then the Secretary of State may have to engage once again with the best
    interests of the children pursuant  to  her  duty  under  s.  55.   The
    substantive case may also reveal obvious points in this  regard  beyond
    the stress and emotion that  one  would  normally  anticipate  will  be
    experienced by family members who are separated from each other.

26. In the instant case, the relevant  paragraph  of  the  decision  letter
    reads:

         "Consideration has been given  to  whether  your  Article  8  claim
         should be certified  under  section  94B  of  the  2002  Act.   The
         Secretary of State has considered whether there  would  be  a  real
         risk of serious irreversible harm if you were to be removed pending
         the outcome of any appeal you may bring.  The  Secretary  of  State
         does not  consider  that  such  a  risk  exists  because  there  is
         insufficient evidence to  demonstrate  that  such  a  risk  exists.
         Therefore it has been decided to certify your Article 8 claim under
         section 94B and any appeal you may bring can only be heard once you
         have left the United Kingdom."

27. I emphasise the phrase  'because  there  is  insufficient  evidence  to
    demonstrate that such a risk exists". Ms Asanovic  accepted  before  me
    that there was limited evidence.  In fact, my attention  has  not  been
    drawn to any evidence of the impact on the applicant's child  of  being
    temporarily separated from the  applicant.   As  I  said  earlier,  the
    statutory scheme passed by Parliament,  in  particular  s.94B,  plainly
    envisages the possibility of family members, including children,  being
    separated from the individual being removed for a temporary period,  as
    well as the possibility of  some  appeals  pursued  from  abroad  after
    certification under s.94B succeeding. It is unarguably not  enough  for
    an individual resisting removal pursuant to certification  under  s.94B
    merely to rely upon general  assertions  of  the  impact  of  temporary
    separation from family  members  including  children.   There  must  be
    specific engagement with the reasons why it is said  that  there  is  a
    real risk of serious irreversible harm during such  temporary  absence,
    particularly if the underlying substantive claim does not on  its  face
    raise the possibility that the impact on the  family  members  will  be
    beyond what may generally be anticipated.

28. In the instant case, the applicant spent a total period of two years on
    remand, in prison and in immigration detention.  By  the  time  he  was
    released, his child was nine years  old.  Accordingly,  the  child  was
    separated from the applicant on a daily basis for two out of  her  nine
    years.  My attention has not been drawn to any evidence that was before
    the respondent of the impact on the child of being separated  from  the
    applicant in this way during this two year period.   My  attention  has
    not been drawn to any evidence that was before the  respondent  of  the
    impact on the child of being separated from  the  applicant  whilst  he
    pursues his appeal from abroad.

29. In all of these circumstances, and for the reasons  I  have  given,  in
    particular the absence of any specific evidence of serious irreversible
    harm to the applicant's child during the period of his  absence  whilst
    he pursues an appeal from abroad, I have concluded that the decision of
    the respondent to certify this claim under s.94B is unarguably  lawful.



30. I have taken into account the fact that the Court of Appeal has granted
    permission in the Byndloss case[2].  I do not consider that  the  grant
    of permission by the Court of Appeal means that I must grant permission
    or a stay of these proceedings.  I have given my reasons  for  refusing
    permission and for the same reasons I also refuse the application for a
    stay of the proceedings.

    Permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal

31. Ms Asanovic did not make an application for permission to appeal to the
    Court of Appeal. I have  considered  whether  to  grant  permission  to
    appeal, as I am obliged to do by virtue of rule 44(4B) of the  Tribunal
    Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008. I refuse  permission  to  appeal
    because there is no arguable error of law.

      Costs

32. The costs of preparing the Acknowledgment of Service are to be paid  by
    the Applicant to the Respondent, summarily assessed in  the  sum  of  �
    320.

      ANONYMITY ORDER
      I make an  order  under  r.14(1)  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
    Tribunal) Rules 2008 prohibiting the disclosure or publication  of  any
    matter likely to lead members of the public to identify the applicant's
    child. To that end, the applicant's name has been anonymised as I  take
    the view that disclosure of his (unusual) name may lead members of  the
    public to identify the child. No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall
    directly or indirectly identify  the  applicant  or  his  child.   This
    direction applies to both the applicant and to the respondent.  Failure
    to  comply  with  this  direction  could  lead  to  contempt  of  court
    proceedings.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notification of appeal rights
A refusal by the Upper Tribunal  of  permission  to  bring  judicial  review
proceedings,  following  a  hearing  is  a   decision   that   disposes   of
proceedings.
A party may appeal against such a decision to  the  Court  of  Appeal  on  a
question of law only. Any party who wishes to appeal  should  apply  to  the
Upper Tribunal for permission, at the  hearing  at  which  the  decision  is
given. If no application is made, the Tribunal must nonetheless consider  at
the hearing whether to give or refuse permission to appeal (rule  44(4B)  of
the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008).
If the Tribunal refuses permission, either in response to an application  or
by virtue of rule 44(4B), then the party wishing to  appeal  can  apply  for
permission from the Court of Appeal itself. This must be done by  filing  an
appellant's notice with the Civil Appeals Office  of  the  Court  of  Appeal
within 28 days of the date the Tribunal's decision on permission  to  appeal
was given (Civil Procedure Rules Practice Direction 52D 3.3(2)).

[1] Section 94B provides:
Appeal from within the United Kingdom: certification of human rights  claims
made by persons liable to deportation
(1)   This section applies where a human rights claim has  been  made  by  a
      person ("P") who is liable to deportation under-
      (a)   section 3(5)(a) of the Immigration Act 1971 (Secretary of  State
    deeming deportation conducive to public good), or
       (b)  section  3(6)  of  that  Act  (court  recommending   deportation

(2)   The Secretary of State may certify  the  claim  if  the  Secretary  of
  State considers that, despite the appeals process not having been begun or

[10] In granting permission, the Court of Appeal said that it was  important
that there be an authoritative and early  decision  of  the  Court  for  the
guidance of tribunals and courts on the grounds which took  issue  with  the
lawfulness of s.94B, its correct construction  and  the  approach  which  it
requires for the guidance.  However,  Lord  Justice  Underhill  specifically
said that he would prefer not to express a definitive view that the  grounds
were arguable.
