Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 I make an order prohibiting the disclosure or publication  of  any
    matter likely to lead members of the public to identify the children of
    the Respondent (also "the claimant").  Breach  of  this  order  can  be
    punished as a contempt of court. I make this  order  because  the  case
    concerns the welfare of children who may be harmed  by  publicity  that
    identifies them,

 2. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against a decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal to allow the appeal of the respondent,  hereinafter
    "the claimant", against the decision of the Secretary of  State  on  24
    October 2017 to refuse her leave to remain  on  human  rights  grounds.
    The claimant is subject to deportation following her being sentenced to
    two and a half years' imprisonment for  offences  of  dishonesty.   The
    details of the offences are summarised at paragraph 15 of  the  refusal
    letter where the Secretary of State said:

         "You were convicted on 11 December 2012 at Derby  Crown  Court  for
         eleven offences including making false  oath  or  declaration  with
         reference to marriage, entering the United Kingdom without leave, 2
         counts of possession of false identity documents  with  intent  and
         four counts of possession of false identity, dishonestly failing to
         notify  a  change  of  circumstances  for  receipt  of  immigration
         benefits and assisting unlawful immigration into EU member state."

 3. The claimant entered the United Kingdom in 2002 and  has  continued  to
    live there but for most of that time she has lived a lie. In short, the
    claimant had cheated the immigration  system  by  entering  the  United
    Kingdom pretending to be someone that she was not.  The claimant  is  a
    citizen of Ghana.  She pretended to be someone  from  Sierra  Leone  in
    need of international protection. She claimed benefits to which she was
    not entitled and used her improperly obtained status to facilitate  her
    husband to the United Kingdom. These  offences  are  amongst  the  most
    serious examples of breach of immigration law by an individual.  Sierra
    Leone was in a state of disorder. There were many credible  reports  of
    undisciplined, often very young, soldiers  rampaging  through  civilian
    communities committed atrocities including rape and brutal amputations.
    Ghana, in contrast, was peaceful and  enjoyed  a  growing  economy  and
    maturing  political  structure.  The  claimant  has   cynically   taken
    advantage of the dire situation that existed in Sierra Leone to  obtain
    dishonestly status and public funds to which she was not entitled.  She
    denied the offences when she was caught. Hers is the kind of  offending
    that brings disrepute to a humane international code  that  intends  to
    protect people who cannot live safely in the countries  of  which  they
    are nationals and which offending, understandably, at least  creates  a
    risk of a person in genuine  need  being  disbelieved  because  of  the
    suspicion that offences like these inevitably generate. The claimant is
    clearly a foreign criminal and clearly liable for deportation.

 4. However she is also the mother of four children who were each  born  in
    the United Kingdom and are each British citizens.  Her first  child,  a
    daughter, TAA, was born in May 2002.  Her first son, DJA, was  born  in
    May 2005.  Her second son, TKKA, was born in  September  2007  and  her
    second daughter EKA was born in February 2009.  The Secretary of  State
    accepted that the claimant was in a "genuine  and  subsisting  parental
    relationship" with the children and they lived  together  as  a  family
    unit.  The Secretary of State further accepted that it would be "unduly
    harsh for your children to return to Ghana with you".

 5. The reasons for accepting these things are given and are  unremarkable.
    They children are British citizens who have  each  spent  their  entire
    lives in the United Kingdom where they are being educated.

 6. The Secretary of State also accepted that the claimant is  married  and
    is in a genuine and subsisting relationship with her husband.   However
    the relationship was not established  when  the  claimant  was  in  the
    United Kingdom lawfully and the Secretary of State did not accept  that
    the claimant's relationship with her husband  was  a  reason  to  avoid
    deportation under the Immigration Rules.

 7. When the case came before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  the  judge  there
    accepted that the effects of removal would be unduly harsh and  allowed
    the appeal. However that is a very gross simplification of  a  decision
    that is complex and in many ways unsatisfactory and before  I  consider
    the grounds I look carefully at what the First-tier  Tribunal  actually
    decided.

 8. Its decision begins, worryingly, by saying that  the  claimant  appeals
    against the decision "to make a deportation order  against  her".   She
    does not.  This is a human rights based appeal and is an appeal against
    a decision to refuse her leave to remain on human rights grounds.

 9. The judge records evidence from the claimant about the difficulties the
    children experienced when she was in prison and  the  need  for  social
    service intervention.  Her husband was willing to work  and  had  jobs,
    first as a warehouse operator and then, after he had  obtained  an  HGV
    license, a driving job.  However he could not work  when  the  claimant
    was in prison.

10. The claimant's husband gave evidence and confirmed  that  he  found  it
    very difficult to look after four children and hold down a job.

11. More importantly there was evidence from an independent social  worker,
    one Gideon Boadu.  Mr Boadu had produced reports dated 19 January  2015
    and 27 February 2018.  In preparing the reports the witness had  spoken
    to teachers at the children's school and someone  who  worked  for  the
    county council social services.

12. In summary there were no concerns about the children when  the  parents
    were together but  the  children  were  distressed  by  their  mother's
    absence.  The First-tier Tribunal  Judge  made  important  findings  at
    paragraph 40 which is one of two extremely long paragraphs  that  would
    have benefitted from some subdivision.  However  in  paragraph  40  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge said:

         "In essence the effects of the [claimant's]  deportation  would  be
         devastating upon the family.  Mr Boadu noted that all four children
         presented with significant  mental  health  difficulties.   It  was
         noted that Mr [A] had  struggled  to  cope.   The  reality  of  the
         position  is  that  the  [claimant]  and  her  husband  face  great
         financial difficulty in the event of Mr [A]  not  working.   During
         the first period when the [claimant] was away from  the  family  Mr
         [A] was unable to work.  The benefits which were paid were stopped.
          He had difficulty finding employment which would let him meet  his
         responsibilities in looking after the children.   Matters  were  so
         bad that he struggled to provide food.  He  had  difficulty  paying
         the rent.  He had difficulty paying  the  bills.   Housing  benefit
         from Derby Council was withdrawn.  Mr [A] was told  that  he  could
         not receive public funds.  There was no entitlement for him  to  do
         so.  This was because he had been granted a residence card based on
         derivative rights."

13. The judge then accepted evidence showing that  the  claimant's  husband
    had received an overpayment of tax credits of almost  ï¿½18,000  and  the
    need to repay that added to  his  stress.   The  judge  considered  the
    possibility of the family being helped by  neighbours  or  friends  and
    said that he found "that the plain reality  of  the  position  is  that
    outside help would not be available on a permanent basis to  cater  for
    the circumstances which I have described",  the  "circumstances"  being
    the need to provide care when the claimant's husband went to work.

14. It was clearly the judge's view that removing the mother (that is, "the
    claimant") from the family would be unduly harsh for the children which
    is the statutory test required by section 117C(5) of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

15. One of the reasons for that conclusion is the financial consequences of
    the claimant's husband to reduce his income to  be  available  for  the
    children or to provide care. However the judge was also clear that  the
    problems were not only financial.  He said:

         "Mr [A] continued to work on the footing which has been  explained.
         Significant  problems  then  developed.   Mr  [A]  was   completely
         dependent on the family  friends  who  have  been  referred  to  to
         provide assistance in caring for the children both before and after
         school.  It was either necessary for someone to stay at the  family
         home from the time to which I have referred in order to  enable  Mr
         [A] to go to work or for Mr [A] to take the children to the home of
         someone else so that they could look after the children  there.   I
         accept the evidence which shows the emotional damage which was done
         to the children while their mother was in prison and while she  was
         detained.  I find their behaviour deteriorated.  I do not find that
         they were able to continue with their education in  the  same  way.
         It was necessary for the two older  children  to  be  referred  for
         counselling.  I  have  accepted  the  reports  of  Mr  Boadu.   His
         qualifications and experience are clear.  It is equally clear as to
         how the foundations for his conclusions have been established.  The
         sources are given.  I find that the reality of the position is that
         the  emotional  damage  upon  the  children  impacted  upon   their
         education.  I find that the  confirmation  of  causation  has  been
         provided by the effect of the  return  of  the  [claimant]  to  the
         family.  I find that Mr Boadu is supported by the views of  Mrs  H,
         the head teacher at [the children's] Primary School.  I  find  that
         the reality of the position is that the [claimant] has played  such
         an important role in the upbringing of all of the children that the
         effect  of  her  removal  would  reflect  the  centrality  of   the
         importance of her role in the emotional and supported contexts.   I
         find that the corollary of this is that Mr [A] cannot  on  his  own
         provide for the emotional and supportive needs for the children  as
         they have developed as they had been met by their  mother  and  the
         exacerbation of the position because of the removal of their mother
         would have the impact on Mr [A] of him being placed in the position
         of being less able to cope with the consequences."

16. The Decision and Reasons continues in the same vein.  At  paragraph  42
    the judge said:

         "I take into account all the factors relevant to the history of the
         [claimant] and her offending.  I  take  into  account  all  matters
         appertaining to policy.  I find for the reasons which I  had  given
         that it would be unduly harsh for the children  to  remain  in  the
         United Kingdom without their mother.  I find the Immigration  Rules
         are met.  I find that compelling circumstances exist  which  enable
         me to proceed to consider  whether  there  would  be  a  breach  of
         Article 8 outside the Rules."

17. The judge then allowed the appeal.  It is plain that  his  main  reason
    for allowing the appeal arose from concerns about  the  rights  of  the
    children.

18. The decision is challenged on three grounds settled by Mr I Jarvis  who
    is a particularly experienced Senior  Presenting  Officer.   Mrs  Aboni
    relied on the grounds.

19. The first ground needs special consideration.  It is  headed  "Material
    misdirection in law/fact - the duty of the Local Authority to a  family
    where basic needs are not being met".

20. The grounds contend that the First-tier Tribunal Judge, having accepted
    the evidence of Mr Gideon Boadu that "the local authority would have to
    take the children into care because there would be  no  money  for  the
    family", went on to conclude at paragraph 40 "In the event  of  failure
    on the part of Mr [A] to earn enough money to look after  the  children
    and with the risk of destitution overtaking the family the  clear  risk
    arises of the children having to go into care".

21. It was the Secretary of State's contention that that finding should not
    have been made.  It is based on a false premise.  There would be  money
    for the family.  The contention  that  money  would  not  be  available
    because Mr [A] was in the United Kingdom because of  derivative  rights
    of residence and therefore  disqualified  from  receiving  benefits  is
    wrong.  This understanding was  then  explained  with  reference  to  a
    decision of the Court of Appeal.  The ground contends that it was wrong
    in law to conclude that the children could be destitute and taken  into
    care and this wrong finding  wrongly  influenced  the  conclusion  that
    there was undue harshness flowing from the mother's removal.

22. I consider if the premise of  this  ground,  namely  that  the  alleged
    erroneous understanding  of  the  law  impacted  significantly  on  the
    finding that there would  be  undue  harshness  in  the  event  of  the
    claimant's removal, is sound.  The possibility of  the  children  being
    taken  into  care  clearly  excised  the  First-tier  Tribunal  because
    provision was made  for  written  submissions  to  be  sent  after  the
    hearing.  I  have  read  the  written  submissions  prepared  by  Ms  E
    Rutherford of Counsel for the claimant dated 24 April 2018.  These drew
    attention to the evidence that the family  were  suffering  financially
    and defended criticisms that the  expert  was  acting  as  an  advocate
    rather than giving impartial opinion evidence.

23. I find paragraph 15 of Ms Rutherford's written submissions particularly
    pertinent and I set it out below:

         "During his  evidence  an  issue  emerged  regarding  the  family's
         finances and what would arise if Mr  [A]  was  unable  to  work  to
         provide for the children considering his  lack  of  entitlement  to
         access public funds.  Mr Boadu was clear that if the children  were
         destitute and there was no entitlement to  public  funds  then  the
         children could be taken into care.  He stated  that  initially  the
         Local Authority would look to see what support  could  be  provided
         but if none could be and Mr [A] was unable to work and  the  family
         were destitute the children  could  be  taken  into  care.   It  is
         submitted that the evidence  is  that  the  family  are  struggling
         financially and has significant  amounts  of  debt.   The  evidence
         shows that Mr [A] is not entitled to claim benefits and has in fact
         received a demand  that  he  repays  tax  credits  that  have  been
         incorrectly paid to him.  The  evidence  shows  that  he  has  been
         overpaid a total of ï¿½17,931.  Debt collection agencies are  already
         pursuing him over a sum of just over ï¿½5,000.  If he  is  unable  to
         work he will have no source of income.   Further  it  appears  that
         reducing his hours or changing jobs and returning to warehouse work
         is not a realistic solution.  Should he do this his income would be
         reduced.  He has provided evidence of his earnings in 2014-2015 and
         2015-2016.   Plainly  the  amounts  that  he   would   obtain   are
         significantly below  that  which  the  family  require  to  support
         themselves as evidenced  by  the  amount  of  debt  that  they  had
         previously accrued and  continue  to  accrue  despite  his  current
         income.  Any reduction in that income will be  disastrous  for  the
         family.  It is submitted  that  the  evidence  shows  that  in  the
         absence of [the claimant], Mr [A] would be unable  to  continue  in
         his present employment.  It is clear that the family are struggling
         on the present earning  and  the  reduction  due  to  him  changing
         employment or him not working at all will place the family in  very
         difficult financial circumstances and there is  a  very  real  risk
         that they will be left destitute."

24. The further submissions on behalf of the respondent are signed  by  the
    Presenting Officer Mr Luke Tallis and are dated  14  May  2018.   These
    contend that the evidence does not  support  the  conclusion  that  the
    family are struggling financially as they claim.  He said that the bank
    accounts show substantial credits during times when  the  claimant  was
    detained.  He said there were no care proceedings.  He then noted  that
    the First-tier Tribunal Judge had stated that the claimant was to serve
    evidence relating to her current income capable of being earned by  the
    claimant's husband both before and after he qualified as an HGV  driver
    and whether B&Q could provide flexible hours, B&Q being  his  employer.
    The required evidence was not produced and  its  absence  was  said  to
    support Mr Tallis's contention that the claimant's husband and claimant
    were not being straightforward about the difficulties they faced in her
    absence.

25. I have also considered Counsel's skeleton argument  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  Again I summarise it by quoting a  leading  paragraph.  Even
    allowing for some slight grammatical drift in the  final  sentence  the
    point is clear.  Ms Rutherford said in paragraph 4:

         "It is submitted  that  this  is  a  close  family  and  that  [the
         claimant] is an integral part of it.  The evidence  is  clear  that
         while she was in prison the entire family struggled  to  cope.   Mr
         [A] struggled to maintain his employment which  of  course  enabled
         him to provide for his family and to care for  the  children  while
         [the claimant] was in prison.  Due to the pressures of  caring  for
         the children on his own he had to  leave  his  employment  and  the
         family  required  financial  assistance.   The  children  struggled
         emotionally and all four presented with mental health difficulties,
         T and D were referred for counselling.  Social services  were  also
         contacted in order to provide  the  family  with  assistance.   The
         children's school have confirmed that they have  noticed  a  marked
         deterioration gather children'(sic) performance at school and their
         behaviour."

26. The skeleton argument went on to assert that the evidence  showed  that
    the situation had normalised after the claimant's return to the family.
     It is clear to me that the case before the First-tier Tribunal was not
    argued on the minutiae of what benefits were available or  whether  the
    claimant's husband was getting all that he was entitled to get but that
    the breakdown in family  relations  caused  by  her  absence  was  very
    significant.

27. I have looked again at the report and addendum prepared  by  Mr  Gideon
    Boadu.  The report was completed in January 2015 and  the  addendum  in
    February 2018.  It would be utterly astonishing and rather worrying  if
    removing the mother did not cause an adverse reaction in the  children.
    However it is right to remember that the adverse reaction presented not
    only in bad behaviour but in children needing psychiatric  support  and
    in one case descending into self harm.

28. I am very doubtful that the First-tier  Tribunal  made  sound  or  even
    clear findings about the family's entitlement to  benefits.   The  case
    was not put on the basis of precise sums.  The evidence that  money  is
    owed to the Revenue and other sources seems to be perfectly  sound  and
    not challenged.  It may very well be that the  claimant's  husband  did
    not manage as well as some people might have managed.  It may  well  be
    that he was keen to keep his job possibly because his skills  lie  more
    in driving a lorry or working in a warehouse than  in  making  a  home.
    His evidence is that he found it very difficult, in fact impossible, to
    be an effective full-time single parent.  Financial difficulties played
    a part but poverty was not the point.  The social worker's evidence was
    that the children are suffering in the absence of their  mother.   Some
    criticism is made of the  social  worker's  impartiality  but  no  good
    reason has been given to doubt it.

29. I find  the  social  worker's  conclusions  entirely  unremarkable  and
    referenced to their sources, much as did the First-tier Tribunal.   The
    First-tier Tribunal Judge's conclusion in paragraph 40 where  he  said:
    "I find that the reality of the position is that disintegration of  the
    family would follow.  I find that this result would follow  even  if  a
    family were able to remain solvent", was entirely open to the judge and
    entirely reasoned albeit that  the  reasons  were  somewhat  buried  in
    paragraphs that are presented disappointingly.

30. With great respect to Mr  Jarvis's  grounds  (and  Mr  Jarvis  did  not
    present the case to the First-tier Tribunal) this is  a  case  of  Aunt
    Sally  knocking.   The  decision  was  not  made  because  of  a  wrong
    impression of the benefits but because there was  practical  experience
    of the father not coping.  There is no point or merit in ground 1.

31. The other grounds can I find be dealt with in a brisker way.

32. The second point is that there is a "Material failure to make  findings
    on matters materially in  dispute  between  the  parties".  This  is  a
    challenge arising from the absence of corroborating evidence  from  the
    people who are said to have provided  care  and  assistance.   This  is
    particularly important because the claimant's husband is the subject of
    a suspended sentence of imprisonment because of his commenting offences
    similar  to,  but  less  serious  than,  the  claimant's.   The   judge
    particularly wanted documentary evidence about  the  support  from  the
    family.

33. This criticism does not amount to an error of law.

34. The evidence of the children's behaviour is in the independent evidence
    of the social worker based on his own observations and what the  school
    has told him.  I do not regard it as a material error  that  the  judge
    did not say more about the evidence that he had not got whether or  not
    requested in further directions.

35. The third  point  is  indifferent  in  kind  and  refers  to  "Material
    misdirection in law: the approach to the public interest".

36. The judge is rightly criticised for not showing any express  regard  to
    the requirements of Part 5A of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum
    Act 2002.  It is an extraordinary omission but I agree  with  Mr  Vokes
    that the material test, namely "is  separation  unduly  harsh  for  the
    children" was identified and applied.

37. It cannot be said that the judge trivialised the offending.  He said in
    paragraph 41 that "it is clear that the nature of the offending of  the
    [claimant] strikes at the heart of the system  being  operated  by  the
    [Secretary of State]". In the same paragraph he refers to his taking "a
    serious view of the offending".  It was clearly the judge's  view  that
    the effects of the children were unduly harsh.   There  is  nothing  to
    suggest that the judge was unaware of the importance of  deporting  the
    claimant even though a model self-direction  is  conspicuously  absent.
    Indeed he  began  his  deliberations  at  paragraph  41  by  referring,
    inappropriately but understandably because the decision of the  Supreme
    Court in KO  (Nigeria)  &  Ors  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department (Respondent) [2018] UKSC 53 had not been handed down, to the
    need to consider the offences to inform his decision about  whether  it
    would be unduly harsh for the children to remain in the United  Kingdom
    without their mother.  He then went on to express  his  disapproval  of
    the offence.  If anything the judge has applied too strict a  test.  It
    is regrettable that the judge did not direct himself expressly that the
    public interested lay in the claimant being deported but it  cannot  be
    said that the judge failed to appreciate the importance of deportation.
    He was deciding a "deportation appeal" and referred to  the  claimant's
    behaviour "striking at the very heart of the system". He did not  allow
    the appeal because he undervalued the need for deportation. He  allowed
    the appeal because he was concerned for the claimant's children.

38. There is nothing important in the criticism  that  the  judge  did  not
    state expressly that he accepted the claimant's husband's evidence that
    one the children had self-harmed. It is clear the decision was based on
    accepting the evidence of the  husband  and  of  the  school  that  the
    children suffered when the claimant was locked up and that there was  a
    big improvement when the claimant returned. The  fact  that  the  local
    authority withdrew support  indicates  that  thing  improved  when  the
    family adjusted to the claimant being in custody. It does not mean that
    there was no cause for concern. The judge clearly accepted the evidence
    that one of the children "self-harmed" and  that  happened  in  October
    2016, some years have local authority involvement ceased.

39. I must address directly paragraph 17 of the grounds asserting that  the
    adverse effect on the children is a normal consequence  of  deportation
    rather than a basis for finding undue  harshness.   Removing  a  parent
    from a child  is  a  very  serious  step.   It  clearly  concerned  the
    sentencing judge before he carried out his duties. Removing a parent in
    circumstances where the relationship with the  child  is  going  to  be
    fractured and where reunion in the child's country  of  nationality  is
    not going to be possible  for  at  least  ten  years  and  maybe  never
    possible, is an extremely serious step but it is what  is  required  by
    deportation.  Nevertheless different families  will  cope  differently.
    At one extreme the deported parent's presence might harm the family and
    that parent's absence will do nothing  but  improve  the  life  of  the
    child.  At the other extreme a child might be entirely dependent on the
    parent who is to be removed and removal would wreck the  child's  life.
    This case is not quite in the second of my postulated extremes  but  is
    not very far from it.  There are four children to consider  here.   Two
    of them female, one of them still very young.   It  is  uncontroversial
    that they will benefit from  their  mother's  presence.   Although  the
    judge did not spell it out in terms he clearly had the  best  interests
    of the children in mind and was of the view that their  best  interests
    lay in remaining in the United Kingdom with their mother. That  is  not
    determinative. This is a case where the absence of the mother has  been
    tested.  The father has done his best.  He has not managed.  The  lives
    of the children have deteriorated. The children needed much support and
    although their circumstances improved so that local  authority  support
    ceased they were far from ideal. The family is heavily  in  debt  (this
    does not depend on the correct understanding of benefits law, it  is  a
    fact that has occurred).  Unlike the case of WZ (China) v  SSHD  [2017]
    EWCA Civ 795 this is not a case where the welfare of the  children  was
    resolved by the mother giving up work.  Rather it  is  a  case  of  the
    welfare of the children diminishing when the father did his  inadequate
    best.

40. It is an unattractive feature of arguments of this kind that  the  less
    effective a parent is the more likely the other parent  is  to  achieve
    the desired (by her) result of avoiding  deportation.   However  it  is
    important to remember that this case, and indeed in my experience  most
    human rights appeals following a deportation decision do  not  turn  on
    the interests and welfare of the person to be deported but the  effects
    that  removal  would  have  on  innocent  people,  typically  children.
    Parliament has provided that for foreign  criminals  not  sentenced  to
    more than four years' imprisonment  can  avoid  deportation  where  the
    effects on children would  be  unduly  harsh.  Albeit  in  a  decidedly
    suboptimal way that is what this judge has decided here.  At  paragraph
    46 of his decision the judge unequivocally decided that  "it  would  be
    unduly harsh for the children to remain in the United  Kingdom  without
    their mother".  He was entitled to conclude that and although I do  not
    want in any way  to  commend  his  structure  or  organisation  of  the
    Decision and Reasons  I  find  that  the  necessary  points  have  been
    considered and rational conclusions reached and that  the  decision  is
    not materially wrong in law.

41. It follows that I dismiss the Secretary of State's appeal.

42. I do not know what leave the Secretary of State will grant the claimant
    as a result of this decision. The claimant must understand  that  there
    is nothing in the First-tier Tribunal's decision or my consideration of
    it that gives her the slightest reason to think  that  her  criminality
    has been in any way excused or overlooked. If, as might happen, she  is
    permitted to stay for the sake of the children, she must not assume for
    a moment that she has established a human right to  remain  after  they
    have achieved their majorities.
