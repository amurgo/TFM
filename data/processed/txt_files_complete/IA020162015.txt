                       (ANONYMITY DIRECTION NOT MADE)
                                                                  Respondent

                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appeal

 1. Although the appellant at this hearing is the Secretary of  State,  for
    the purposes of this decision I refer to the parties as  they  were  in
    the First-tier  Tribunal.   This  is  a  resumed  hearing.   The  Upper
    Tribunal, at a hearing on 30 November 2015, found an error of  law  and
    set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal promulgated on 21 May
    2015.  The error of law decision is appendixed  to  this  Decision  and
    Reasons.



Remaking the Decision

 2. I rely on the background to this case set out in the  appendixed  error
    of law decision.  Although the panel hearing the error of law  decision
    had been initially disposed to remake the  decision  on  the  available
    evidence, the panel concluded that the case should be re-listed  for  a
    further hearing.

 3. In particular, it was noted that the  appellant's  sponsor  claimed  to
    have two British Citizen children one of whom lived with  her  and  the
    appellant.  However, this was not a feature of  the  appellant's  claim
    that was alluded to by the  First-tier  Tribunal  although  it  clearly
    bears relevance to an assessment both under paragraph EX.1. of Appendix
    FM and potentially Article 8 outside of the Rules.

 4. The panel therefore made directions set out in the appendixed  decision
    requiring the appellant to file and serve a bundle with copies  of  the
    birth certificates and passports of the sponsor's children and evidence
    in relation to the current circumstances of the children.  It was  also
    envisaged that witness statements  would  be  provided  from  both  the
    appellant and sponsor.  The Secretary of State was directed to file and
    serve a bundle of any further evidence to be relied on.

 5. The resumed hearing therefore came  before  me.   Directions  were  not
    complied with by either party.  Mr Msaki was  in  attendance  with  the
    sponsor.  However, he had written a letter to  the  Tribunal  dated  30
    January 2016 requesting the Upper Tribunal to  discontinue  or  not  to
    resume the appeal as it was indicated that Mr  Msaki  had  submitted  a
    fresh application to the Home Office and did not  wish  to  pursue  the
    appeal before the Upper Tribunal as he considered the fresh application
    to be the preferred  remedy.   In  reply  the  Tribunal  wrote  to  the
    appellant on 2 February 2016 advising him that it was the Home Office's
    appeal which was before  the  Upper  Tribunal  and  the  appellant  was
    therefore not in a position to withdraw the appeal.  It  was  indicated
    that the Tribunal would have required confirmation from the Home Office
    that they wished to withdraw the appeal.

 6. Ms Sreeraman took instructions at my direction and indicated  that  the
    Home Office was not minded to  withdraw  the  initial  decision  of  12
    December 2014 as this would potentially cause greater difficulties  for
    the appellant, who now had a fresh application before  the  respondent.
    It was noted that Ms Sreeraman was aware that this was  in  the  system
    although it had initially been returned to the appellant on  the  basis
    of a  technicality.   The  appellant  indicated  before  me  that  this
    technicality  had  been  resolved  and   the   application   had   been
    resubmitted.

 7. Mr Msaki confirmed to me that he had not complied with  the  directions
    alluded to above as he was of the view that he wished  to  pursue  only
    the fresh application before the respondent and he indicated to me that
    he did not wish to give evidence before  the  Tribunal.   I  considered
    that the appellant was not legally represented before me.  However  the
    appellant has had considerable opportunity to take advice, if required,
    in relation to his immigration matters and to provide any  evidence  or
    information that he might want to be considered in connection with this
    appeal (including as set out in  the  Decision  on  Error  of  Law  and
    Directions promulgated on 4 January 2016.  I was satisfied  that  there
    was no unfairness to the appellant in proceeding.

 8. In terms of remaking the decision I considered the respondent's refusal
    letter and Ms Sreeraman's submissions together with Mr Msaki's lack  of
    compliance with the relevant directions and the lack  of  any  evidence
    before me that might address the issues the Tribunal  set  out  in  our
    decision on the error of law dated 22 December  2015.   In  particular,
    although I took into consideration that Mr Msaki and his  sponsor  were
    available before the Tribunal, there was no evidence, as  directed,  in
    relation to the circumstances of  the  children  (for  example  witness
    statements, reports from their schools or similar and/or information or
    evidence from  the  children's  father  and/or  evidence  as  to  their
    relationship with the appellant).

 9. It was not disputed that the  appellant  did  not  meet  the  terms  of
    Appendix FM, in particular the terms of Appendix FM-SE in  relation  to
    demonstrating that his sponsor's income was as claimed.  The  specified
    evidence was not provided.  I also note, as indicated in the  error  of
    law decision, that although the judge was satisfied that at the date of
    appeal the appellant had shown that his sponsor was earning  ï¿½20,564.88
    per annum, this was on the basis of an  inaccurate  assessment  of  the
    evidence.

10. Although the appellant indicated before me that he did not  attend  the
    last hearing because he did not receive the  letter,  nevertheless  the
    appellant was in a position to produce documents including  a  skeleton
    argument and an appendixed bundle for that previous hearing.  I did not
    accept that explanation.

11.  I  accept  Ms  Sreeraman's  argument  that  the  appellant   had   not
    demonstrated that he met the requirements of Appendix FM in relation to
    his partner.  I also accept that it had not been demonstrated that  the
    appellant met the requirements of the parent route under Appendix FM.

12. In relation to Appendix FM EX.1. the following requirements need to  be
    met:

         "EX.1.   This paragraph applies if

                (a)

                    (i)     the  applicant  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting
                        parental relationship with a child who -

                        (aa)   is under the age of 18 years; or  was  under
                             the age of 18  years  when  the  applicant  was
                             first granted leave  on  the  basis  that  this
                             paragraph applied;

                        (bb)   is in the UK;

                        (cc)   is a British citizen or has lived in the  UK
                             continuously  for  at  least  the  seven  years
                             immediately preceding the date of  application;
                             and

                    (ii)   it would not be reasonable to expect the child to
                        leave the UK; or

                (b)     the  applicant  has   a   genuine   and   subsisting
                    relationship with a partner who is in the UK  and  is  a
                    British citizen, settled in the UK or  in  the  UK  with
                    refugee leave or humanitarian protection, and there  are
                    insurmountable  obstacles  to  family  life  with   that
                    partner continuing outside the UK.

         EX.2.    For the purposes  of  paragraph  EX.1.(b)  'insurmountable
                obstacles' means the  very  significant  difficulties  which
                would  be  faced  by  the  applicant  or  their  partner  in
                continuing their family life together  outside  the  UK  and
                which could not be overcome or  would  entail  very  serious
                hardship for the applicant or their partner."

13. In light of the lack of adequate evidence before me I am not  satisfied
    that it has been demonstrated that the  appellant  has  a  genuine  and
    subsisting parental relationship with either of the sponsor's  children
    (and, as noted in the error of law decision, it was  stated  that  only
    one of  the  sponsor's  children  lives  with  the  appellant  and  the
    sponsor). In addition it was also not established given the failure  to
    comply with directions that the appellant  has  demonstrated  that  his
    sponsor does indeed have children and that those children  are  British
    citizens.  Therefore the  appellant  is  not  in  a  position  to  meet
    paragraph EX.1.(a).

14. In relation to EX.1.(b), although I accept that  the  appellant  has  a
    genuine and subsisting relationship with a partner, again, in light  of
    the lack of any evidence before me I am not satisfied that it has  been
    demonstrated that there are insurmountable  obstacles  to  family  life
    with that partner continuing outside the UK, bearing in mind  the  lack
    of any adequate evidence before me.  I have also taken into account the
    relevant jurisprudence including that  Appendix  FM  does  not  include
    consideration of the question whether it would be  disproportionate  to
    expect an individual to return to his home country  to  make  an  entry
    clearance application to re-join family members in  the  U.K  and  that
    there may be cases in which there are no  insurmountable  obstacles  to
    family life being enjoyed outside the UK where temporary separation  to
    enable an individual to make an application for entry clearance may  be
    disproportionate.  However it for the individual  to  provide  evidence
    that any such temporary separation  will  interfere  disproportionately
    with protected rights. (R (on the application of Chen) v  Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department) (Appendix FM  -  Chikwamba  -  temporary
    separation - proportionality) IJR [2015] UKUT 189 (IAC) applied).

15. There was no evidence before me of any hardship that might be caused in
    requiring the appellant to make an application outside the UK,  as  the
    evidence indicated that he still has family in Tanzania and  there  was
    no adequate evidence that it would cause  undue  hardship.   I  am  not
    satisfied that it has been demonstrated that  the  appellant  can  meet
    either of the limbs of EX.1.  I am further  not  satisfied,  given  the
    lack of any adequate evidence before this Tribunal, that  it  has  been
    demonstrated that there is anything not sufficiently  considered  under
    Appendix  FM  which  would  require  an  assessment  outside   of   the
    Immigration Rules in respect of Article 8.

16. Further, in the alternative, I am not satisfied that any assessment  of
    Article 8 outside of the Immigration Rules would  produce  a  different
    result, and I have considered Section  117  of  the  2002  Act.   I  am
    satisfied that any interference with family or private  life  would  be
    proportionate.  The appeal is therefore dismissed  in  the  alternative
    under Article 8.

17. Therefore, as indicated at  the  hearing,  I  dismiss  the  appellant's
    appeal; as noted above  the  appellant  intends  to  rely  on  a  fresh
    application before the respondent.  That  is  not  a  matter  for  this
    Tribunal.

Notice of Decision

The Judge of the First-tier Tribunal made an error of law and  his  decision
to allow the appeal under Article 8 is set aside.   I  remake  the  decision
dismissing the appeal under the Immigration Rules.

No anonymity direction was sought or made.
