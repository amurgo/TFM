Representation:

For the Appellant: In person
For the Respondent: Mr Dnwyicz, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS




     1. This is an appeal against a determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
        Judge Fletcher-hill promulgated on 14 March  2014  which  dismissed
        the appellant's appeal against the refusal of leave to remain as  a
        Tier 4 (General) Student.


     2. The only ground of appeal was whether the First-tier  Tribunal  was
        correct to find that the appellant had not shown that  he  had  the
        requisite funds of ï¿½1,600 for the period 11 July to 7 August 2013.

     3. The respondent's Rule 24 letter dated 12 June  2014  conceded  that
        the determination of the First-tier Tribunal disclosed an error  on
        a point of law such that it should be set aside and re-made.

     4. Mr Dnwyicz confirmed that position at the  hearing  before  me  and
        also conceded that the bank statement  provided  by  the  appellant
        with his original application did, in fact, show the required funds
        for the required period and appeared to have been  misread  by  the
        respondent and the First-tier Tribunal.

     5. I was in agreement with the position taken by the respondent at the
        hearing and found an error of law in the decision of the First-tier
        Tribunal such that it was set aside to be re-made.  I  re-made  the
        appeal as allowed under the Immigration Rules relating  to  Tier  4
        (General) Migrants.

Decision

     6. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal discloses an error  on
        a point of law and is set aside to be re-made.


     7. I re-make the appeal as allowed under the Immigration Rules.
