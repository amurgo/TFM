Representation

For the Appellant:     Mr Nasim, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Ms Everitt, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant is a national of Pakistan born on 12  January  1983.   He
    appealed against the respondent's decision taken  on  15  May  2013  to
    refuse to issue  a  Residence  Card  as  confirmation  of  a  right  of
    residence in the UK under European community law as the  brother-in-law
    of an EEA national exercising treaty rights in the UK.  He claims to be
    an extended family member of  an  EEA  national  and  her  spouse  (his
    younger  brother)  under  Regulation  8(1)  of  the  Immigration  (EEA)
    Regulations 2006.  In a determination promulgated on  31  January  2014
    the First-tier Tribunal dismissed his  appeal  under  the  Regulations.
    His grounds of  appeal  also  relied  on  Article  8  of  the  European
    Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.  At  paragraph  11
    of the determination the  FtT  found  that  the  issue  did  not  arise
    because, reading shortly, it was said in the reasons for refusal letter
    that in the event of the appellant's not making a  voluntary  departure
    from the UK a separate decision might  be  made  at  a  later  date  to
    enforce his removal.  The FtT found, at paragraph 12, that there was at
    that time no interference with the appellant's  Article  8  rights  and
    that it was open to him to make a separate human  rights  claim  if  so
    advised or alternatively to appeal against any  removal  decision  that
    might in due course be made.

2.   Permission to  appeal  the  decision  was  refused  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal on 8 April 2014 and  permission  was  sought  from  the  Upper
    Tribunal.  Paragraph 2 of the grounds submitted to the  Upper  Tribunal
    was to the effect that the FtT, in its  determination,  and  the  Judge
    refusing permission to appeal had made an error of law.  Paragraph 3 is
    in the following terms:

        "3.  It is submitted that the appellant is extended  family  member
           of his brother as claimed." [sic].


     The remainder of the grounds refer to Article 8 considerations.

3.   Permission to appeal was granted, the following reasons being given  by
    the Upper Tribunal Judge:

        "It is arguable that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  erred  in  law  by
        refraining from determining the appeal on Article  8  ECHR  grounds
        notwithstanding the statement  made  in  the  respondent's  refusal
        notice and quoted by the judge at [11].  The appeal  raises  issues
        including the application of the principles enunciated in JM [2006]
        EWCA Civ 1402 to appellants  relying  upon  the  Immigration  (EEA)
        Regulations 2006."


4.   Before us Mr Nasim submitted that the refusal to decide the  Article  8
    issue was an error of law and this was conceded by Ms Everitt  for  the
    Secretary of State.  Indeed the Rule 24 notice had conceded the  point.
    We are quite satisfied that the concession on behalf of the  respondent
    was properly made and have no difficulty in finding  an  error  of  law
    established.

5.   Mr Nasim drew our attention to paragraph 3 of  the  grounds  of  appeal
    which we have mentioned above.  He seemed  to  be  submitting  that  he
    should be allowed to argue that the appellant was  an  extended  family
    member in terms of the Regulations and was making  no  concession  that
    the determination of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  was  correct  in  that
    regard.  This was not, however, the  basis  upon  which  permission  to
    appeal  was  granted  and  we  refused  to  allow  the  matter  of  the
    Regulations to be  ventilated.   Paragraph  3  did  not  in  any  event
    constitute a ground  of  appeal,  being  merely  an  assertion  of  the
    appellant's position.  We decided however that we  should  re-make  the
    decision insofar as it proceeded on a consideration of Article 8 and we
    heard evidence and submissions.





The Evidence

6.   The appellant adopted a statement  dated  16  January  2014.   In  that
    statement he said that he came to the United Kingdom on 7 May 2007 on a
    valid student visa.  His brother arrived in the UK in 2009.  Since  the
    latter had been in the  UK  he  had  been  financially  supporting  the
    appellant.  His brother and his wife,  a  Spanish  national,  had  been
    married since August 2011 and they now had a  one-year  old  son.   His
    brother had been supporting him financially by  depositing  money  into
    his account as well as occasionally giving him cash in hand as  "pocket
    money".  When he and his brother lived in Pakistan they  lived  at  the
    same address.  His brother had been working in the United  Kingdom,  as
    had his wife, who was a self-employed jeweller.  She was registered  as
    self-employed and was  exercising  her  treaty  rights  in  the  United
    Kingdom.

7.   In oral evidence he said that he  used  the  money  he  was  given  for
    personal things such as mobiles,  going  out  with  friends,  food  and
    drink.  He could not return to Pakistan because he had  nothing  there.
    He had sold all of his property in that country and had been  here  for
    more than seven years.  While he was able to work  here  he  worked  in
    Foot Locker but his job finished in 2012 and he had  not  worked  since
    then because he was not allowed to.   He  had  intended  to  study  but
    having paid his fees the two colleges he was to attend closed down.  He
    still wished to study.  In cross-examination he  said  that  his  uncle
    paid the college fees and his father paid the visa fees.   His  brother
    gave him money for shopping.  Both his parents were still  alive.   His
    uncle lived in America but his parents lived in Pakistan.  He said that
    his father was a farmer and had distributed all of his property to  his
    children.  The appellant had sold his share.  His parents  were  living
    with his younger brother and he could not go there.  They  had  nothing
    to give him and could not support him.  He was asked if his brother  in
    the UK could still give him money if he went to Pakistan but he said he
    was living with him and his brother provided his food as well as giving
    him extra money.  It would take him ages to find a job in Pakistan.  He
    was not working in the UK at the moment, it was not easy to get work in
    Pakistan and he was now over 30 years of age.  He had  paid  his  taxes
    when he was able to work in this country and had obeyed the law.

8.   The  appellant's  brother  Hassan  Abbas  adopted  his  statement.   He
    confirmed that he came to the United Kingdom in 2009 and married  on  5
    August 2001.  He and his wife now had one young son.  He and his family
    lived with the appellant at the same address in Watford.  He  had  been
    supporting his brother while he was in the United Kingdom by giving him
    cash in hand or putting money into his account.  In Pakistan they lived
    at the same address.  He confirmed that his wife was exercising  treaty
    rights in the United Kingdom, being self-employed as  a  jeweller.   In
    oral evidence he was asked what impact there would be on  him  and  his
    family if the appellant were to go back to Pakistan.  In answer to that
    question he said that his brother spent time with him and did not  have
    anything left back home, having sold his own property, so it  would  be
    terrible for him.  When the question was asked again he said  that  his
    brother helped him a lot at home  with  his  child  as  well  as  going
    shopping.

9.   In cross-examination he  said  that  he  put  �37  into  his  brother's
    account on a weekly basis.  If he went back to Pakistan he  would  give
    him money.  He was asked if the appellant could live with  his  parents
    and his younger brother.  He said his brother recently got married  but
    that his parents lived in the house the family used to  live  in.   The
    brother who got married lived in a different place.  There was  another
    younger brother living at the family home who was still studying.  Even
    if he provided money to his brother in Pakistan that would not help him
    there.  It would not be enough.  He would  not  be  able  to  build  up
    enough to get married for example.

10.  The final witness was Laura Izquierdo Perez.

11.  She adopted her statement, which  confirmed  that  she  was  a  Spanish
    national and had been married to the appellant's brother  since  August
    2011.  She and her husband had a young son aged one and they all  lived
    in Watford with the appellant.  The appellant  had  always  lived  with
    them since she had been living with her  husband  and  the  latter  had
    always supported the former financially.  He gave him money on a weekly
    basis,  sometimes  cash  or  sometimes  by  way  of  deposit  into  the
    appellant's bank account.

12.  In cross-examination she said that her husband usually provided  around
    �50 a week to the appellant.

Submissions

13.  Ms Everitt submitted that article 8 was  not  engaged.   The  appellant
    and his brother were grown up and he lived  with  his  brother  out  of
    convenience or perhaps financial necessity because he could  not  work.
    While he helped with his brother's child and with  shopping  there  was
    nothing which took the case beyond the usual family ties.   As  far  as
    private life was concerned, the appellant had been in the UK more  than
    seven years  but  a  lot  of  that  time  was  without  leave  and  was
    precarious.  There had not been much evidence about private life  other
    than the fact that he worked in  Foot  Locker  and  had  made  abortive
    attempts to study in two colleges.  He would have support when he  went
    back to Pakistan.  She pointed out  the  discrepancy  in  the  evidence
    between that of the appellant and that of his brother  in  relation  to
    where the parents lived.

14.  Mr Nasim referred to paragraph 8 of the  determination  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal and  under  reference  to  Dauhoo  said  that  there  was
    evidence of financial dependency.  It was clear that the appellant  and
    his brother saw themselves as a family unit.  Mr Nasim referred to  the
    evidence of the support provided by the appellant in  relation  to  the
    child and the shopping.  There would not be much for the  appellant  in
    Pakistan and he would have difficulty in obtaining a job.  Family  life
    was clearly established and it would be  disproportionate  if  it  were
    broken up.  He drew  our  attention  to  evidence  of  bank  statements
    showing money being paid to the appellant by his brother.





Discussion

15.  We have no difficulty in accepting that the appellant has been in  this
    country for over seven years and has been living with his  brother  and
    his wife since at least August 2011.  We are satisfied that he  assists
    with childcare from time to time and with shopping.  We  are  satisfied
    also that his brother supports him financially.   The  bank  statements
    bear that out as does the testimony, written and oral, which was placed
    before us.  The bank statements contain  various  figures  for  "pocket
    money" ranging from �25 to �150 but we understand that the amount  will
    change from time to time and it seems to us that a figure of about  �50
    a week reasonably reflects the level of financial support provided.

16.  Having said all that, and mindful of  the  Razgar  tests,  we  are  not
    satisfied that Article 8 is engaged at all.  Leaving aside the question
    of finance at the moment there is nothing in the evidence  which  leads
    us to the conclusion that there is anything between the brothers  other
    than the usual family ties.  We accept that the appellant lives in  his
    brother's house effectively as a non-paying guest, albeit  contributing
    to some extent to the performance of household tasks.  The money  which
    the appellant receives does not seem to us to take the matter very far.
     His own description of it as being for mobiles and going out with  his
    friends chimes with the description of it in the bank statements and in
    his statement as "pocket money".  None of  this,  either  alone  or  in
    combination, is sufficient to elevate this to the sort of  family  life
    which is required.

17.  It may be that some private life has  been  established  here  but,  if
    there is, the only evidence we heard about it was  the  fact  that  the
    appellant worked for a time with  Foot  Locker  and  had  two  abortive
    courses of study.

18.  In the circumstances we are not persuaded that either  family  life  or
    private  life  have  been  established  so  that  Article  8   has   no
    application.

19.  Even if we are wrong in  this  we  are  perfectly  satisfied  that  the
    removal of the appellant  will  be  in  accordance  with  the  law  and
    necessary for the upholding of proper immigration control and  that  it
    will be proportionate.

20.  The evidence was to the  effect  that  the  appellant's  brother  would
    continue to support him financially and the appellant  has  not  proved
    that he would be unable to live with his parents, in  the  family  home
    where he grew up.  In reaching this conclusion  we  bear  in  mind  the
    discrepancy previously referred to.  It may be that he will  have  some
    difficulty in obtaining work but if that is so he will be in  precisely
    the same position he is in at the moment.  He will doubtless be able to
    maintain contact with his brother and his family through  modern  means
    of communication.  Effectively there was nothing in the evidence  which
    tended to show that his removal would be disproportionate.




Decision

21.  We allow the appeal against the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    only in respect that there has been an error of law consisting  of  the
    failure to deal with the question of the application of Article 8 ECHR.
     We re-make the decision in that  regard  and  dismiss  the  appeal  on
    Article 8 grounds for the reasons herein before stated.
