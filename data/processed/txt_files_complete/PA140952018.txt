Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr. J. Gazzain, Counsel instructed by United
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr. L. Tarlow, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the Appellant against  a  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge O'Brien, promulgated on 27 February 2019,  in  which  he
    dismissed the Appellant's appeal against the Respondent's  decision  to
    refuse a grant of asylum.
 2. As this is an asylum appeal, I make an anonymity direction,  continuing
    that made in the First-tier Tribunal.


 3. Permission to appeal was granted as follows:-

         "It is arguable that having accepted the appellant's evidence as to
         his  personal  history  in  Afghanistan  the  Judge's  failure   to
         expressly consider ï¿½7.7.2 of  the  respondent's  COI  "Afghanistan:
         unaccompanied children" (1  April  2018),  which  addresses  "bacha
         bazi", adversely impacted upon the consideration as to whether  the
         appellant could reasonably relocate  within  Afghanistan  with  the
         support of extended family members."

 4. The Appellant attended the hearing.

 5. Mr. Tarlow accepted on behalf  of  the  Respondent  that  the  decision
    involved the making of a material error of law.  He asked that I remake
    the decision allowing the Appellant's appeal on asylum grounds.  Taking
    this into account, I set the decision aside and  remade  the  decision,
    allowing the Appellant's appeal.

Decision and Reasons

 6. At [40] the Judge states,

         "The Appellant's account of being used by a local  commander  as  a
         dancing boy for his  amusement  and  pleasure  is  consistent  with
         background evidence.  It also lacks any specific political  element
         or allegations of  physical  abuse  that  one  might  expect  in  a
         fabricated account; put simply, in my judgment  the  account  seems
         too sophisticated to be made up.  I accept that  it  is  reasonably
         likely to be true."

 7. At [44] and [45] he states:

         "I am not satisfied that the Appellant was  persecuted  because  of
         imputed political opinion but am satisfied that it was  because  of
         his  membership  of  a  particular  social  group:  young  men   in
         Afghanistan.  Even if I were wrong about that,  I  would  still  be
         satisfied that the Appellant faced a real risk of serious  harm  on
         return arising from sexual abuse.


         Given that the Appellant's  abusers  worked  for  a  pro-government
         militia working closely with the police against the Taliban,  I  am
         satisfied that the Appellant would not have  sufficient  protection
         from the state on return."

 8. Mr. Tarlow accepted that, having found the Appellant's  account  to  be
    true, the appeal should have been allowed with reference  to  paragraph
    7.7.2 of the CPIN  Afghanistan:  Unaccompanied  children,  April  2018.
    This paragraph states:

         "There is a culture of silence and shame that prevents  bacha  bazi
         victims and their families from  seeking  assistance.  Victims  and
         their families reportedly face social  isolation,  particularly  if
         the boy becomes well known in bacha bazi circles. Those who try  to
         complain to authorities also face threats from perpetrators or  are
         fearful due to the high status of perpetrators  who  are  sometimes
         officials or  police.  Running  away  has  reportedly  resulted  in
         beatings. Victims are frequently themselves punished, detained when
         seeking assistance, or revictimized."

 9. The Judge found that the Appellant was at  risk  on  return,  and  that
    there was no sufficiency of protection.   However,  having  made  these
    findings, he found that the Appellant could  relocate  in  Afghanistan.
    This conclusion is at odds with the finding that he would not  be  able
    to avail himself of state protection.  The Judge has not explained  how
    the Appellant's extended family would be able to protect him, if  there
    is no protection from the state.  The CPIN makes clear that the culture
    of silence and shame will prevent both the  Appellant  and  his  family
    from seeking assistance, and that his  family  will  also  face  social
    isolation.


10. I find that the evidence set out in the Respondent's own guidance shows
    that there was a risk on return to the Appellant.  The Judge's findings
    should have led to the  Appellant's  appeal  being  allowed  on  asylum
    grounds.  He failed to take the evidence in the CPIN into account.   It
    was submitted by Mr. Tarlow that this was a material error of law  and,
    as stated above, he asked  me  to  remake  the  decision  allowing  the
    Appellant's appeal.

11. I thanked Mr. Tarlow for his approach to this appeal.

Notice of Decision

12. The decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  involves  the  making  of  a
    material error of law and I set the decision aside.

13. I remake  the  decision  allowing  the  Appellant's  appeal  on  asylum
    grounds.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.


Signed                                  Date 19 May 2019

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

I have allowed the appeal.  In the event that a fee  has  been  paid  or  is
payable, I have considered making a fee award.  I have  decided  to  make  a
fee award for the whole fee paid as the Appellant's account was found to  be
true, and the Respondent's own guidance indicates that he  is  therefore  at
risk on return.
