                    ON AN APPLICATION FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW

                              APPROVED JUDGMENT
                     - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -



MR JUSTICE COLLINS:


1.  This is an application for  judicial  review  of  the  decision  of  the
    Secretary of State originally made on 18 March 2016 whereby she refused
    the application made by the applicant for indefinite leave to remain in
    this country on the basis of him meeting the requirements of Tier 1.


2.   The basis of the refusal was that it transpired that he  had  made  tax
    returns, in particular for the year ending April 2013,  which  did  not
    coincide with the figures put to the Secretary of State in relation  to
    his earnings.

3.   It is important to note that it was, on the  face  of  things,  in  his
    interests to reduce the amount on which he had to pay tax  when  making
    his returns to Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, but it  assisted  his
    application for  leave  to  remain  the  higher  the  income  he  could
    establish because  more  points  were  awarded  for  higher  levels  of
    earnings.

4.   The discrepancy was relied on by the respondent and  the  decision  was
    that there had been a deliberate failure to provide correct figures and
    that meant that the applicant fell foul, and they put it that  way,  of
    the  requirements  of  paragraph  322(5)  of  the  Immigration   Rules.
    Paragraph 322 is a provision which justifies the refusal  of  leave  to
    remain on a number of specific grounds even if, on the face of  it,  an
    individual might qualify in relation to the grounds he relies on.   322
    provides and I quote:-

         "In addition to the grounds for refusal of extension  of  stay  set
         out in Parts 2-8 of these Rules, the following provisions apply  in
         relation to the refusal of an  application  for  leave  to  remain,
         variation of leave to enter or remain or,  where  appropriate,  the
         curtailment of leave ...

         Grounds on which leave to remain and variation of leave to enter or
         remain in the United Kingdom are to be refused

         ...

         (5)  the undesirability  of  permitting  the  person  concerned  to
             remain in the United Kingdom  in  the  light  of  his  conduct
             (including convictions which  do  not  fall  within  paragraph
             322(1C),  character  or  associations  or  the  fact  that  he
             represents a threat to national security ...".

5.   There is no doubt, and the applicant accepted that the figures that  he
    put to HMRC were not correct.  He had employed a firm of accountants in
    order to produce the relevant  figures  and  there  is  in  the  bundle
    information from the  accountants,  a  firm  called  Oasis  Accountants
    Limited, dated 12 February 2013, and what the accountant said,  so  far
    as material, was that in accordance with the  applicant's  instructions
    and to assist him to fulfil his funding for the requirement in relation
    to extension of leave to  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom,  they  were
    pleased to put together  the  financial  statements  for  the  relevant
    period, which was a period ending 1 January 2013.

6.   The then application that was being referred to was, it would seem,  an
    application which was approved  in  March  2013  when  he  was  granted
    further leave to remain as a Tier 1 (General)  Migrant  until  3  March
    2016. So it seems that, on the face of  it,  the  information  obtained
    from the accountants was for that purpose, and what the  figures  given
    by the accountants were that, in a detailed trading and profit and loss
    account for the relevant period, the operating profit was �29,972. When
    it  came  to  submitting  the  relevant  tax  return,  the  information
    submitted was not at all the same. What was then stated  was  that  the
    turnover amounted to �29,555 and then there  were  deducted  what  were
    described as allowable business expenses which included costs of  goods
    bought, car, van and travel expenses, a significant sum of  �8,500  for
    wages, salaries and other staff costs, and  �1,100  odd  for  rent  and
    rates, and the total of such expenses was said  to  amount  to  �17,700
    odd, so that the net profit  was  �11,818,  and  there  was  a  further
    deduction in relation to investment allowance  of  �400,  so  that  the
    taxable sum, or rather the sum upon which tax was due to be  paid,  was
    �11,418.

7.   What the applicant now says in relation to that is in a statement  that
    he made long after the decision with which we are concerned as follows.
     He says that he had  already  submitted  copies  of  the  amended  tax
    returns, as indeed he had, and he was not properly advised by his  then
    accountants.   What  he  says  in  the  statement  in  that  regard  at
    paragraphs 9 to 13 is as follows:-

     "9. At the time of my applications to the  Secretary  of  State  I  did
              genuinely believe that my income was accurately stated in  my
              management accounts.

     10. At the time of my official tax  returns  I  had  sought  assistance
              from an accountant and he  advised  me  additional  heads  of
              expenses that can be charged from my income.

     11. It was only once I had seen (he names the  firm),  accountants  who
              filed my 2010-2011 and 2012-2013 amendments, I realised  that
              I was ill-advised previously.

     12. I could not charge certain items as business expenses  therefore  I
              had to submit amends to the tax returns.

     13. I submit that at no stage did I deliberately  try  to  deceive  the
              Secretary of State or HMRC."

8.   What he  said  when  he  was  asked  about  this  in  relation  to  the
    application that he made for the permanent leave to remain is  set  out
    in the refusal letter.  He was asked:-

         "Q   -   Are you satisfied  that  the  self-assessment  tax  return
                  submitted to HMRC accurately  reflect  your  self-employed
                  income?

         A    -   You ticked 'No' to indicate you are not satisfied that the
                  self-assessment tax return  submitted  accurately  reflect
                  your income and added a note that states: 'for  the  years
                  2010-11 & 2012-13 I have already sent the revised  version
                  last year to HMRC after consulting new accountant.  Letter
                  of acknowledgement attached.'

         At your appointment on 08 February 2016 ...  you  were  interviewed
         about your earnings.  Question 6 of the interview asked:

         Q    -   You have identified that there have been  errors  in  your
                  tax return for the years 2010-11 and 2012-13. How did  you
                  come to realise these errors?

         A      -     Immigration   Solicitor   noticed    when    preparing
                  applications."

     and the decision maker went on to say this:-

     "Were it accepted that the figure declared to the Home  Office  was  an
         accurate representation of your earnings between February  2012  to
         January 2013, your actions in failing to declare your  earnings  in
         full to HM Revenue & Customs would  lead  your  application  to  be
         refused under paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration  Rules  based  on
         your character and conduct, as it would be considered that you have
         been deceitful or dishonest in your  dealings  with  HM  Revenue  &
         Customs."

9.   The decision maker went on to accept  that  it  would  not  necessarily
    follow that if the figure declared to the Home Office was accurate  and
    the failure to notify customs appropriately  would  not  inevitably  be
    culpable, but the point was made that there would have been  a  benefit
    to him in the low figure to the Revenue and the higher  figure  to  the
    Secretary of State and the decision was that in  the  circumstances  it
    was believed that dishonesty had been established and  accordingly  his
    presence in the United Kingdom was not conducive to the public good.

10.  There is no question but that the test to be  applied  in  establishing
    dishonesty is on the balance of probabilities, but it  has  often  been
    said that the more serious an  allegation  the  greater  the  level  of
    probability, if that is the right way of putting it,  that  has  to  be
    established, and there is  no  question  that  in  order  to  establish
    dishonesty the higher level of the balance has to be applied, albeit it
    is still the balance of probability.  Mr Sharma submits too  that  when
    one looks at the terms of 322(5) and the guidance that is applied,  the
    conduct relied on must be at a high level in order to justify a finding
    that it was non-conducive to an individual to remain.   The  references
    are to character or associations and convictions, but it is made  clear
    that the existence of a conviction is not necessary, and  a  threat  to
    national security, and there was no question of that  arising  in  this
    case. But if a false tax return, or indeed any  false  information  has
    been given knowingly to the Secretary of State or to another Government
    body for any purpose, that  would  suffice,  but  it  is  necessary  to
    establish that it was done deliberately and was not simply a mistake or
    a result of poor advice.

11.  The difficulty, as I see it in the case put by the applicant,  is  that
    he has asserted that he was given particular advice which would  enable
    him to put in the  expenses  that  he  relied  on  to  reduce  his  tax
    liabilities, but there is no evidence produced from either the original
    accountants, Oasis, who made the report, or any  subsequent  accountant
    who may have spotted the error and dealt with it.  If it were  accepted
    by a representative of the accountants that he  was  so  advised,  that
    would be an exceedingly powerful point  in  his  favour.   Equally,  of
    course, it would be damaging to him if it was  not  accepted  that  any
    such advice had been given.  The difficulty as I see it that  he  faces
    is that the report from Oasis could  not  be  clearer.   It  refers  to
    profit and the profit will be what is earned over  and  above  expenses
    that have been properly incurred. That is the only sensible meaning  to
    be attached to profit, and so it is to say the least  strange  that  he
    felt able to include the expenses against that figure.  Furthermore, it
    is perhaps, as I have said, surprising that we have had  no  supporting
    evidence at all to deal with the error that he says was a genuine error
    and it, of course, is a fact that the Oasis report was obtained with  a
    view to the making of the application, and that was the figure that was
    put in the application.

12.  Mr Sharma submits that there has been no clear indication as  to  which
    of the amounts the respondent alleges to have been  dishonest,  but  it
    seems to me that if  one  looks  at  this  sensibly,  it  is  the  HMRC
    submission that was the wrong one, and indeed  that  is  the  effective
    approach of the Secretary of State if one looks at the decision  letter
    as a whole.

13.  There was an administrative review sought and obtained.  The  applicant
    in his submissions in effect indicated that it was a mistake,  that  he
    was someone who would not have put anything dishonest and he had worked
    hard in order to establish his right to remain in this country  and  it
    would hardly have been either in his interests or likely that he  would
    have thrown that away by making any false representation, either to the
    Home Office or to the Customs. The review upheld the decision that  had
    been made.

14.  There was a further point that in  the  decision  letter  there  was  a
    refusal to accept the figure of �26,716 which was said to amount to the
    profit for the year ending 31 January 2016 and the Secretary  of  State
    did not accept those earnings were from genuine employment.

15.  In the review application it was said that evidence could  be  produced
    to establish that, but that was said not to be material which a  review
    would accept and essentially that if there was to  be  any  such  extra
    evidence it would need to be made with a fresh application.

16.  That point, that is to say reliance in any  event  on  the  failure  to
    accept the �26,000 odd figure, only arises if I am with  the  applicant
    on what I will call "the dishonesty point".  I must say that since,  as
    it seems to me, the only real basis for relying  on  dishonesty  is  in
    what was submitted to the Revenue  &  Customs  and  since  the  �26,676
    figure is in conformity with the �29,000 figure put forward  by  Oasis,
    it does not seem to me that if that had stood on its own it would  have
    been a proper basis for refusal.

17.  I put it that way because it is and  has  to  be  accepted  that  as  a
    result of a decision of the Court of Appeal in The Queen (Giri)  v  The
    Secretary of State [2015] EWCA Civ 784 the  approach  that  I  have  to
    adopt is to consider whether the decision of the Secretary of State was
    a rational decision.  It is not for me to remake the  decision  because
    there is no right of appeal and thus the right is limited  to  judicial
    review.  Mr Sharma submits that there should be a greater  flexibility,
    particularly where deception is involved  and  there  is  no  right  of
    appeal which should enable the court  in  a  proper  case  to  consider
    facts.  Indeed, in a subsequent case called McVey it was  indicated  by
    Mr Justice Silber that there should be an application to cross-examine.
    That is something that is open, yet in fact, in  the  context  of  this
    case relates to the second ground, which I  will  come  to,  but  as  a
    matter of principle, if there is a factual  issue  it  is  possible  in
    certain circumstances, if it considers it is essential in the interests
    of justice to do so for the court to allow that  there  can  be  cross-
    examination, even if it is not a case which falls within the  precedent
    fact exemplified by the age assessment decision in the Supreme Court, M
    v Croydon, or which itself stem from Khawaja v The Secretary  of  State
    in relation to deception used to obtain leave to enter.

18.  Since the only remedy is judicial review, as I say,  it  must  be  that
    unless prevented by some matter which it  cannot  overcome,  the  court
    will try to do justice if it can. But the  general  rule  for  judicial
    review is that one looks at the material that was before the  Secretary
    of State when the decision was made, and of course it would  have  been
    open to  the  applicant  to  have  produced  evidence  to  support  his
    contention in relation to the wrong information  given  to  HMRC  which
    went beyond merely his assertions; that he did not do.  Furthermore, it
    is interesting to note that in the tax return the box which is there to
    indicate whether he has had any advice was left blank, and  accordingly
    there is no indication that he did receive advice.

19.  I do understand the concerns of the applicant, but I am afraid that  it
    is impossible in my judgement to say that the Secretary of State  acted
    irrationally in concluding  as  she  did.   Even  now,  the  supportive
    information has not been provided  and  it  was  clearly  open  to  the
    Secretary of State to  rely  on  the  advantage  to  the  applicant  in
    understating for tax purposes his income and giving the true figure  in
    relation to his application, because unless one  disregards  the  Oasis
    report, and there is no good reason  to  do  so,  it  is  difficult  to
    believe that that was not a true figure which was produced.

20.  There is a further point raised by  the  applicant  and  that  is  that
    there has been a failure to comply with the guidance that a decision to
    refuse on 322(5) has to  be  approved  by  a  senior  caseworker.   The
    Secretary of State has produced a statement from Hilary Grace  who  was
    the senior caseworker for the Sheffield Service Centre  which  was  the
    relevant centre which dealt with the application in question.  There is
    produced what are described as the GCID records which are filled out in
    order to indicate the progress of an application.  There is no specific
    indication that the decision maker referred  the  matter  to  a  senior
    caseworker. However, what is said in relation to 18 March, which is the
    date of the decision, is that the relevant documents were sent  to  the
    Admin Review Team, although as I say, it is not said in terms  that  it
    was submitted to a senior caseworker and that  is  something  that  the
    guidance requires.  In the statement this is said and I quote:-

         "7.  ... It is standard procedure in Premium Services that  a  case
             must be referred to a Senior Caseworker  if  a  caseworker  is
             proposing to refuse an  application.   Once  the  decision  to
             refuse is approved  by  the  Senior  Caseworker,  the  refusal
             letter must also be approved by the Senior  Caseworker  before
             the decision can be finalised and notice of decision served on
             the applicant.

         8.   I can confirm that I was in the office on 18 March  2016,  and
             that the caseworker who made the  decision  is  aware  of  the
             process for referring cases to a  Senior  Caseworker  when  an
             application falls for refusal.

         9.   I can therefore state with a high degree of certainty that the
             case was referred to me for approval of the refusal,  and  for
             checking the refusal letter on 18 March 2016,  before  it  was
             finalised ..."

    That statement was made on 15 February  2017,  so  some  eleven  months
    after the events in question.  It is perhaps  not  entirely  surprising
    that she does not recall in terms, particularly as there is nothing  in
    the GCID notes which indicate that it was referred to  her.  Mr  Sharma
    submits, and one can understand why, that that  is  not  sufficient  to
    indicate that there was indeed the referral that was necessary.  It  is
    known that the Administrative Review Team does involve consideration by
    a senior caseworker, but furthermore, as it seems to me, I have no good
    reason to doubt that the necessary procedure was gone through.

21.  There is one further matter I should  deal  with  before  leaving  this
    case. Going back to the first ground, Mr Sharma relies  upon  the  fact
    that HMRC has not taken any steps to impose a penalty.  There is, as  a
    report which has been presented indicates, a power to impose a  penalty
    in relation to any late return or amendment of  a  return  and  it  is,
    under the relevant legislation incumbent upon HMRC to consider  in  any
    given case whether it is appropriate to impose a penalty.   Of  course,
    it may be in a given case  appropriate  to  go  further  and  institute
    criminal proceedings.  One can well  understand  that  HMRC  would  not
    institute criminal proceedings unless there was a very good  reason  to
    do so and the fact that that has not occurred it does not help one  way
    or the other, but there is some force in the submission that  the  fact
    that no penalty has been imposed, which would be the case if  HMRC  did
    not  take  the  view  that  there  was  any  carelessness,  let   alone
    dishonesty, then why should the Home Office, or UKBA as  it  then  was,
    take a different view which was a  view  that  indeed  there  had  been
    deliberate failure to put forward the appropriate correct sums, and  it
    was not merely carelessness.  It seems to me that I  do  not  think  Mr
    Malik in the end really felt able to contradict this, but  that  it  is
    only if there was a deliberate failure to produce proper  figures  that
    322(5) should probably be applied.  If he was indeed badly  advised  or
    if it was mere carelessness, that would  not  on  its  own  suffice  to
    justify 322(5).

22.  The difficulty again here is that we have no evidence from the  Revenue
    as to whether they did consider the question of penalty or what  steps,
    if any, they decided to take and the reasons why they decided  as  they
    did.  It, in my judgement, cannot be assumed that in every case, having
    regard to what one knows to be the pressures on HMRC, that  they  would
    have gone through  the  exercise  that  maybe  they  should  have  gone
    through, and decided that they were satisfied that there was  not  even
    carelessness.  It seems to me that in  any  given  case,  depending  on
    amounts, depending on the circumstances, HMRC may well decide that  the
    effort in reaching particular conclusions frankly is not  justified  in
    all the circumstances.  I am afraid I do not think that the  fact  that
    HMRC has decided not to take  further  action  can  indicate  that  the
    decision of the Secretary of State is one which was irrational.

23.  It follows that in all the circumstances, I am  bound  to  say  with  a
    degree of regret, I cannot find that  this  application  is  made  out.
    Accordingly it must be dismissed.
