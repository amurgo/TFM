                           Decision and Directions


 1. The claimant appeals against the decision of Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal C H O'Rouke  who,  following  a  hearing  on  26  April  2018,
    dismissed her appeal in a decision promulgated 2  May  2018  against  a
    decision of the respondent of 21 November  2017  to  refuse  her  human
    rights claim of 29 September 2016.

 2. In his decision letter, the respondent stated that he was not satisfied
    that the appellant satisfied the suitability requirement  in  S-LTR.4.2
    because he considered that she had submitted  a  fraudulently  obtained
    TOEIC certificate from  Educational  Testing  Service  ("ETS")  in  her
    application of 19 November 2013 for leave  to  remain.  The  respondent
    considered that she therefore could not benefit from the exceptions  in
    EX.1 of Appendix  FM  and  she  could  not  meet  para  276ADE  of  the
    Immigration Rules. He therefore considered the  appellant's  Article  8
    claim outside the Immigration Rules on  the  basis  that  she  did  not
    satisfy the requirements for leave  to  remain  under  the  Immigration
    Rules. He concluded that there were no exceptional circumstances in the
    appellant's case that warranted the grant of leave  to  remain  on  the
    basis of Article 8 outside the Immigration Rules.

 3. The judge found that the appellant had fraudulently obtained her  TOEIC
    certificate for reasons which he set  out  at  para  21(i)-(v)  of  his
    decision. He therefore found that she  did  not  meet  the  suitability
    requirement in S-LTR.4.2. He also concluded that  she  could  not  rely
    upon EX.1 of Appendix FM or para 276ADE of the  Immigration  Rules.  He
    concluded that she could not meet the requirements of  the  Immigration
    Rules.

 4. The judge then considered her Article 8 claim outside  the  Immigration
    Rules.  In  his  consideration  of  s.117B(6)   of   the   Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (the "2002 Act") and the  circumstances
    of the appellant's child who  was  a  qualifying  child  as  a  British
    citizen, he considered the guidance  of  the  Court  of  Appeal  in  MA
    (Pakistan) [2016] EWCA Civ 705. This included guidance  to  the  effect
    that "a court or Tribunal should not simply  focus  on  the  child  but
    should  have  regard  to  the  wider  public  interest  considerations,
    including the conduct and immigration history of the parents".

 5. The judge considered  the  appellant's  Article  8  claim  outside  the
    Immigration Rules in detail,  as  well  as  the  circumstances  of  the
    appellant's child and whether it was reasonable for the child to  leave
    the United Kingdom. He concluded that the  decision  was  proportionate
    stating, inter alia, that "The  strong  public  interest  in  requiring
    those who would wish to obtain leave to remain in the UK to comply with
    and respect the Rules and the appellant's flaunting of that requirement
    provides the 'good, cogent reasons' for the child's removal from  [sic]
    UK" (para 29(viii) of his decision).

 6. At the hearing before me, Ms Shaw and Mr Walker agreed that  the  judge
    had erred by failing to consider whether  to  exercise  his  discretion
    under S-LTR.4.2 in the appellant's favour. It  was  also  agreed  that,
    through no fault of his own, he erred in his consideration  of  whether
    it would be reasonable for the appellant's child to  leave  the  United
    Kingdom, in that, he took  into  account  the  appellant's  conduct  in
    obtaining a fraudulently issued  TOEIC  certificate,  contrary  to  the
    guidance of the Supreme Court in KO (Nigeria) [2018] UKSC 53 which  was
    delivered on 24 October 2018, i.e. after his decision was made.

 7. I entirely agree with the parties that the judge  did  err  in  law  as
    described in the preceding paragraph.

 8. Mr Walker also agreed with Ms Shaw's  submission  that  the  judge  had
    erred in  law  in  his  consideration  of  whether  the  appellant  had
    fraudulently obtained the TOEIC certificate. Mr Walker agreed  with  Ms
    Shaw that the judge had not applied the guidance in SM and Qadir [2016]
    UKUT 229 (IAC). Although the question whether the judge  had  erred  in
    law in this respect was a matter  for  me,  I  was  nevertheless  in  a
    difficult position. After having carefully considered the  position,  I
    decided that, the errors described at para 6 above were sufficient  for
    the Upper Tribunal to set aside the judge's decision. I  therefore  set
    his decision aside.

 9. In deciding the extent to which any findings should stand, I took  into
    account the fact that Mr Walker had agreed with Ms Shaw that the  judge
    had  erred  in  his  consideration  of  whether   the   appellant   had
    fraudulently obtained her TOEIC certificate. On that basis,  I  decided
    not to preserve any findings of fact and to remit  the  appeal  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal, as Ms Shaw had requested  and  as  Mr  Walker  had
    agreed, for a fresh hearing on all issues.

Notice of Decision

The decision of Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  O'Ruorke  involved  the
making of errors on points of law such that his decision  falls  to  be  set
aside. The decision was set aside.

The appellant's appeal against the respondent's decision is remitted to  the
First-tier Tribunal for a fresh hearing on the merits on all issues.
