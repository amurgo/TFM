                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This appeal to the Upper Tribunal by the  Secretary  of  State  first
       came before Upper Tribunal Judge Coker sitting  at  Manchester  on  6
       October 2016.

    2. It was an appeal by the Secretary of State against a decision of  the
       First-tier Tribunal (Judge Gladstone) who had allowed the Appellant's
       appeal on human rights grounds on 7 January 2016.

    3. The appeal arose as a result of a decision taken by the Secretary  of
       State on 22 December 2014 to deport the Mr Olusanya and to refuse his
       human rights claim.  His  human  rights  claim  was  certified  under
       section 94B of the Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  The  deportation
       order was signed on 15 January 2015 and he was  deported  on  26  May
       2015.

    4. Judge Coker found that the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  had  made  a
       material error of law and  set  the  decision  aside  retaining  some
       factual findings. She adjourned the matter at that stage to be listed
       for a resumed hearing before an Upper Tribunal Judge.

    5. Thus the matter came before me.

    6. Unfortunately, what had not been noticed by the  First-tier  Tribunal
       or previously by the Upper Tribunal is that this is a case where  the
       deportation decision was made in the window of  time  which  deprived
       the Appellant of a right of appeal.

    7. The case of Nkomo (Deportation: 2014 rights of  appeal)  [2016]  UKUT
       285 (IAC) confirms that a person against whom a deportation  decision
       was made in the period 10 November 2014 - 5 April 2015  may  have  no
       right of appeal if the decisions actually made carry rights of appeal
       only under the new appeals provisions.  The  decision  in  this  case
       having been made on 22 December 2014, within that period  means  that
       this Appellant has no right of appeal.

    8. Accordingly the appeal  by  the  Secretary  of  State  to  the  Upper
       Tribunal is allowed and in re-deciding  the  appeal  the  Appellant's
       original appeal against Secretary of State's  decision  is  dismissed
       for want of jurisdiction.

    9. There has been no application for an anonymity order  and  I  see  no
       justification for making one.


Signed   Date 8th November 2016

Upper Tribunal Judge Martin
