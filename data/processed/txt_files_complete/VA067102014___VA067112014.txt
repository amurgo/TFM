                            DECISION AND REASONS
                             EXTEMPORE JUDGMENT

1.   The original Appellants were Mrs  Maqsood  and  her  son  and  to  ease
    following this decision I shall  continue  to  refer  to  them  as  the
    Appellants although this is an appeal by the Entry  Clearance  Officer.
    The Appellants had applied for entry clearance  to  seek  to  join  the
    Sponsor.  The appeal had come for hearing  before  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Oliver at the Hatton Cross Hearing Centre.  By way of a  Decision
    and Reasons promulgated on 3 September 2015 the judge had  allowed  the
    Appellants' appeals on human rights grounds.  The  Secretary  of  State
    sought permission to appeal.  Permission was granted and the matter has
    come before me for hearing today.  This is my extempore decision.

2.   The Entry  Clearance  Officer  grounds  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge's be decision be overturned raised the following matters.  It was
    said that the determination was a very short one.  Article 8  has  been
    used, in reality, as a dispensing power.  There  were  no  findings  of
    fact in relation to matters which were raised such as  the  Appellant's
    date of birth.  There was also a suggestion that the Appellant  had  no
    financial ties to her home country.  This had required a  finding.   It
    was said that immigration control cannot be dealt with in  the  cursory
    way that it was.  Paragraph 10 of the judge's decision  was  inadequate
    and in any event paragraph 10  makes  no  sense  where  it  says  "it's
    important" and then "less important".  In any event  the  matters  were
    significantly underplayed from the ECO's side of  the  balance.   There
    was no real engagement with Article 8.  I was  referred  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal's decision in the case of  Kaur  (visit  appeals;  Article  8)
    [2015] UKUT 487 (IAC) and in particular paragraph 27  where  the  Upper
    Tribunal said in part of that paragraph:

         "Overall, unless an Appellant can show that  there  are  individual
         interests at stake covered by Article 8 of a particularly  pressing
         nature so as to  give  rise  to  a  strong  claim  that  compelling
         circumstances may exist to justify the grant  of  LTE  outside  the
         Rules (see SS (Congo) at [40] and [56]), he is exceedingly unlikely
         to succeed.  That  proposition  must  also  hold  good  in  visitor
         appeals."

    It was submitted that the matter ought to be remitted to a new judge at
    the First-tier Tribunal so that he or she  could  deal  with  both  the
    legal and factual disputes.

3.   Mrs Price in her submissions said that there was no material  error  of
    law.  The judge had allowed the case on human rights grounds only.   He
    took into account all the points raised by the Respondent.  In relation
    to the allegation in respect of the date of birth it was up to the Home
    Office to provide HOPOs in a court to make those arguments.  In reality
    they just want a second bite of the cherry.  They were not there to  do
    their job.  All matters that  were  alleged  were  taken  into  account
    including  that  another  application  could  be  made.   The   judge's
    reasoning is all there.  I should take into account Lord Bingham's five
    points and that family life was engaged.  That was then set  out.   The
    question was had there been a legal application  of  matters.   It  was
    said that although appeal rights had  been  taken  away,  human  rights
    grounds can still be used when there are close family  ties.   That  is
    why Article 8 rights remain but there are no  appeals  under  paragraph
    41.  There was a lawful application here.  To get to the background  of
    the matter you need to see the previous history.  There was no evidence
    of repeated applications and there was no deception or  the  like.   It
    was said that an older case of Palais [2002] UKIAT 05119  ought  to  be
    taken into account.  It was disproportionate to refuse the application.
     There was no material error of law.

4.   Mr Kotas said in reply that there was no "second bite  of  the  cherry"
    because the matters were raised in the original ECO refusal.  It  would
    have been different if they had not  been.   I  invited  Mrs  Price  to
    reply.  She said  that  the  judge  had  said  he  is  satisfied  about
    intention.  In reality this was a very  minor  thing  which  was  being
    raised, that the refusal letters can raise all  sorts  of  things,  the
    judge did deal with matters adequately and  that  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer's appeal ought to be dismissed.

5.   In coming to my decision, as I indicated during the  discussion,  I  do
    not have any difficulty with the principle that there can be legitimate
    Article 8 claims from family members who seek to join a Sponsor here in
    the United Kingdom for the purpose of a visit.  Even more so when  that
    family visit involves a child as this case seems to. That principle  is
    enshrined by the fact that there can be out of country appeals based on
    human rights. The Judge was not wrong in  considering  a  human  rights
    appeal. That is not really the basis of the  ECO's  appeal.   The  real
    issue which arises is whether the First-tier  Tribunal's  decision  and
    reasons adequately sets out for both parties why it was that  they  won
    or lost. In my judgment it is abundantly clear that the Entry Clearance
    Officer did raise  factual  issues  in  the  refusal  letter  dated  28
    September 2014.  That letter raised specific and clear  reasons  as  to
    why  the  Appellants'  applications  for  entry  clearance  were  being
    refused. Part of the decision said:

         "We contacted your spouse in the UK regarding  his  Sponsorship  to
         you.  However he could not answer basic questions about you such as
         your age or date of birth and referred to you as  his  fianc�e.   I
         would expect your spouse of over two years to know this information
         about you and be clear on his relationship to  you  and  also  know
         your child.  I do not find it credible that your spouse is not able
         to answer this  information  and  I  am  not  satisfied  that  your
         relationship is as you have claimed."

6.   It is  abundantly  clear  that  there  was  a  specific  factual  issue
    highlighted to the Appellants. Namely why was it that the Sponsor could
    not get basic things right?  Was it really his wife that  sought  entry
    to the United Kingdom or was she only his fianc�e.  What is her age  or
    what is her date of birth?  Did the Sponsor now know  these  things?  I
    accept of course that getting a call during a working  day  might  take
    one by surprise but that simply does not answer the question.  Why  was
    the Sponsor not able to say that this application related to his  wife?
    In my judgment the Entry Clearance Officer's grounds which  state  that
    there was a failure to resolve a conflict of fact is made  out.   There
    was a failure by the judge  to  make  a  finding  in  respect  of  this
    important matter.  He needed to say one way or the other  whether  this
    was a matter he accepted or not.  It was not enough for him to say that
    this was a husband and wife case.  It needed to be  set  out  in  clear
    terms why the findings were being made in favour of the Appellants  and
    against the Entry Clearance Officer.  In my judgment it means that  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal is fatally flawed in  that  respect
    in any event.  However, even if I am wrong about that,  the  judge  has
    indeed failed to explain why there cannot be other ways in  which  this
    family could seek to continue their life as  they  currently  do.   The
    judge has indicated in his decision that there would  be  a  sufficient
    incentive for the Appellant to comply with the Immigration Rules and in
    terms of having to leave the United Kingdom but there is a  failure  to
    deal with  Article  8  in  the  required  lawful  way.   I  accept  the
    submission on behalf of the Entry Clearance Officer  that  the  law  is
    clear.  Article 8 is not a general dispensing power.  There have to  be
    good reasons as to why an appeal is being allowed in respect of Article
    8.  It cannot simply be said that there is an equal balance  of  public
    interest when  dealing  with  immigration  control  against  all  other
    matters.  There is an imbalance in terms of assessment in favour of the
    Respondent.

6.   Further and in any event there  are  other  credibility  aspects  which
    were not dealt with adequately.  The Sponsor said he could  not  go  to
    visit Pakistan because he feared he might be at risk because of a  land
    or property dispute.  That goes against the fact that he  has  recently
    married there and that he has visited Pakistan.  Therefore  it  appears
    clear that the Sponsor could continue to make visits to  Pakistan.  Nor
    was there apparently a response from the Appellants and the Sponsor  as
    to why they could not meet in a different third country  (not  here  in
    the United Kingdom) if  Pakistan  really  was  too  dangerous  for  the
    Sponsor. I accept that the Judge's task was perhaps made more difficult
    by the  non-attendance  with  no  apparent  reason  by  a  Home  Office
    Presenting Officer, but that did not  mean  that  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer's refusal letter had any  less  weight.  The  burden  of  proof
    remained on the Appellants to deal with that refusal letter.

7.   Therefore this appeal by the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  succeeds.  The
    First-tier Tribunal's does not adequately deal with  factual  or  legal
    matters. I accept that short decisions can be sufficient and are to  be
    commended, but if the main issues are not dealt with in such  decisions
    then, as in this case, the decisions will show material errors of  law.
    I conclude that there has not therefore been a sufficient hearing and I
    direct that the matter be remitted to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  where
    there will be a rehearing in respect  of  all  matters.   None  of  the
    findings from the First-tier Tribunal's decision are to remain.
