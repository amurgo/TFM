Representation

For the Appellant:     Mr S Whitwell, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondents:   Miss S Haji, counsel (instructed by Immigration
Chambers)

                            DECISION AND REASONS

  1. For the sake of convenience I shall refer  to  the  appellant  as  the
     secretary of state and the respondents as "the claimants."


  2. The claimants' applications made on 16  February  2013  for  leave  to
     remain in the UK as joint  Tier  1  entrepreneur  migrants  under  the
     points based system were refused by the secretary  of  state  in  each
     case on the basis that they were not entitled to any points in respect
     of access to funds as required under Appendix  A  of  the  Immigration
     Rules. It was contended in accordance with paragraph 39, Table  4d  of
     Appendix A of the Rules that the claimants  had  to  show  on  a  date
     falling  within  three  months  immediately  prior  to  the  date   of
     application that they had access to not less than �50,000.  For  money
     held in the UK only, the account must be in the applicant's  own  name
     only or both names for an entrepreneurial team.


  3. It was contended that the first claimant  who  had  formed  a  Tier  1
     Entrepreneurial team with the second  claimant  supplied  his  Halifax
     current account statements from 17 September 2012 to 15 January  2013.
     During that period, the balance was consistently below �50,000  within
     the three months preceding his application.


  4. He had also supplied Barclays Cash Card  account  statements  from  14
     June 2012 to 12 December 2012, a Barclays  current  account  statement
     from 3 December 2012 to 23 January 2013 and an Every Day Saver Account
     from 18 June 2012 to 23 January 2013. The  combined  savings  totalled
     less than �50,000 on any given day in the three months preceding their
     applications.


  5. Nor had they  submitted  any  evidence  demonstrating  that  they  had
     registered with HM Revenue and Customs as self employed, or registered
     as the director of a new or existing business, as required under Table
     4(d).


  6. The first claimant had stated that he had access to funds  of  �25,000
     being made available to him by the second claimant.  As  evidence,  he
     produced a declaration from Mr Butt. However, there was no letter from
     the financial institution in which Mr Butt's funds were held that  was
     supplied to establish that the funds are accessible to the claimant as
     specified in paragraph 41-SD(a)(i) of Appendix  A.  Nor  was  there  a
     declaration from a legal representative establishing that  the  letter
     of permission supplied  was  valid,  as  specified  in  paragraph  41-
     SD(b)(ii) of Appendix A.


  7. Further, the first claimant was  awarded  no  points  for  maintenance
     under Appendix C. The Halifax bank statements that  he  supplied  were
     dated to 15 January 2013 only and  were  accordingly  not  within  one
     month of his application date.


  8. Insofar as the second claimant's reasons for  refusal  are  concerned,
     the same contentions are  made  in  respect  of  access  to  funds  as
     required under Appendix A. In his case, he had provided a  declaration
     from the first claimant but no  letter  had  been  supplied  from  the
     financial institution where Mr Malhi's funds are held. Nor was there a
     declaration from a  legal  representative.  The  second  claimant  was
     however awarded ten points for maintenance (funds) under Appendix C.


  9. In each case the secretary of state stated that the decision had  been
     made not to request additional  documentation  or  to  consider  their
     applications exceptionally under paragraph 245AA  of  the  Immigration
     Rules, as it was not anticipated that addressing the omission or error
     would lead to a grant of leave.


      The proceedings before the First-tier Tribunal: 27 June 2014


 10. In a short determination First-tier Tribunal Judge Lobo allowed  their
     appeals under the Immigration Rules. He set out the requirements under
     the rules [4-6].


 11. He stated that 'on the files' were  the  bundles  of  the  respondent,
     which included the  applications,  the  refusal  letters,  notice  and
     grounds of  appeal  and  the  documents  which  accompanied  both  the
     application and the appeal [7]. The claimants relied on  a  bundle  of
     182 pages including signed witness statements, and other documents  in
     support of their appeals (that bundle is before the Upper Tribunal).


 12. He stated that he had read and considered all the papers  before  him.
     The whole of the documentation set before  him  has  assisted  him  in
     arriving at his conclusions [9].


 13. He set out a summary of the reasons for refusal, namely that they  had
     failed to provide satisfactory evidence that  they  had  the  required
     �50,000 for the specified period prior to their applications. They had
     failed to provide the "specified document", namely evidence that  they
     were registered with HMRC.  In  addition,  he  noted  that  the  first
     claimant  failed  to  provide  evidence  that  he  had  the  �900  for
     maintenance for the required period of time.


 14. Judge Lobo's conclusions are set out at paragraph 13. He found "on the
     evidence" that:


     a) both claimants made statutory  declarations  confirming  that  they
        each possessed in excess of �25,000 in personal bank  accounts  and
        that they mutually agreed that the funds  were  available  to  each
        other - bundle pp. 33-34);


     b) solicitors acting for the  claimants  at  the  time  confirmed  the
        preparation and making of each statutory declaration;


     c) each claimant sent to the secretary of state their application  via
        solicitors' letter, each letter reciting the documents  which  were
        sent and which included evidence that each claimant is  a  director
        of AR Digital Ltd; that it is registered with HMRC  and  there  was
        evidence of contract and invoices with clients;


     d)  that the first claimant had, in a personal account  with  Halifax,
        in excess of �26,000 and  that  the  second  claimant  had  in  his
        personal bank accounts both  savings  and  current,  in  excess  of
        �25,000. He referred to pages 131 to 133 and 136 to 151. The  first
        claimant's account with Halifax showed that he held  in  excess  of
        �28,000 on 13 February 2013.


 15. The documentation provided by  the  first  claimant  included  further
     copies of his current account statement. The statement bears the stamp
     of the Halifax bank (Ilford) dated 17 June 2014.


 16. Insofar as the second claimant is concerned, Judge Lobo stated that he
     had shown in his personal bank accounts with  Barclays,  both  savings
     and current, that he had in excess of �25,000. He  referred  to  pages
     136-151 of the claimants' bundle.


 17. Again, these are statements  produced  after  the  date  of  decision,
     including his statement as at 12 March 2013  indicating  his  balances
     with Barclays exceeding �26,000. The Barclays statement  at  page  138
     showed that he had in excess of �25,000 in his account on  23  January
     2013. However, on 28 January 2013,  �25,200  was  transferred  to  his
     Every Day Savers account. The relevant credit is shown  at  page  141,
     indicating that on 28 January 2013, he had �26,209.10 in his  account.
     On 18 February 2013, �25,200 was transferred to his cash card  account
     with a description in the bank statement "Ref: Investment".


 18. Judge Lobo found that as a consequence 'of the  decided  facts',  each
     claimant  persuaded  him  that  they  fulfilled  the  requirements  of
     Appendix A and the first claimant had also fulfilled the  requirements
     under Appendix C.


 19. On 7 October 2014, Upper Tribunal Judge O'Connor granted the secretary
     of state permission to appeal. It was arguable that the  Judge  failed
     to determine the issue of whether the required  funds  were  available
     with reference to paragraph 41-SD(a)(i) and (b)(ii) of Appendix A, and
     in the alternative, failed to provide  legally  adequate  reasons  for
     concluding  that  such  specified  documents  were  provided  to   the
     secretary of state with the applications.


 20. Mr Whitwell relied on the secretary of state's grounds supporting  the
     application for permission. He referred to paragraph 7 of the grounds,
     where it is asserted that the Judge failed to make any finding  as  to
     whether a legal representative declaration was submitted at  the  time
     of and in support of the claimant's applications. The Judge found that
     the solicitors acting for them at the time confirmed  the  preparation
     and making of each statutory declaration.


 21. However, I have  had  regard  to  the  claimants'  former  solicitors,
     Consilium Chambers LLP, who sent an accompanying letter in support  of
     the claimants' applications, dated 13 February  2013.  The  solicitors
     confirm that the 'enclosed original statutory  declaration'  was  made
     under oath and was signed before Mr Syed Akhtar, their  solicitor,  on
     13 February 2013. He stated that he checked the signatories'  identity
     documents which were original Pakistani passports.  In  the  event  Mr
     Whitwell did not pursue that particular ground.


 22. He submitted in reliance on the other grounds that the Judge had given
     inadequate  reasons  for  his  finding   that   they   fulfilled   the
     requirements of paragraph 245DD(b) of the rules. The  bank  statements
     submitted with the application  failed  to  demonstrate  the  required
     funds on any given day in the three months preceding the  application.
     He failed to make any finding as to whether the bank account statement
     submitted with the application demonstrated  the  possession  of  such
     funds on any one given day.


 23. Nor did the claimants provide bank  letters  demonstrating  access  to
     each other's funds. The Judge had failed  entirely  to  consider  that
     ground of the original refusal. The claimants also  failed  to  submit
     evidence demonstrating registration with  HMRC  as  self  employed  or
     registration as the director of a new or existing business. The  Judge
     had failed to consider whether evidence produced at  the  hearing  had
     been submitted at the time of and in support of their applications. Ms
     Haji accepted that the Judge had not been entitled  to  rely  on  post
     decision evidence, having regard to the provisions  of  s.85A  of  the
     Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.


 24. He submitted that the  first  claimant  failed  to  provide  documents
     demonstrating possession  of  �900  for  the  period  specified  under
     Appendix C and E of the Immigration Rules. It is  contended  that  the
     Halifax Bank statements supplied by the first claimant were dated only
     until 15  January  2013,  which  was  not  within  one  month  of  the
     application date.


 25. Mr Whitwell  submitted  that  the  bank  statements  produced  in  the
     claimants' bundle, which were  considered  by  the  Judge  related  to
     events post dating the date of the decision.  It  is  clear  from  the
     claimants'  bundle  that  the  bank  statements   from   Halifax   are
     duplicates, which were only printed on 17 June  2014.  The  statements
     are at page 133 and 134.


 26. On behalf of the claimants, Ms Haji submitted that paragraph 41-SD (a)
     referred to  specified  documents  to  show  evidence  that  money  is
     available to  invest.  The  sub  paragraphs  (a)(i)  and  (a)(ii)  are
     disjunctive. The claimants relied  on  paragraph  41-SD(a)(ii),  which
     refers to specified documents required for money held in the UK  only.
     In that  case,  only  a  recent  personal  bank  or  building  society
     statement from each UK financial institution holding the funds,  which
     confirms the amount of  money  available  to  the  applicant  (or  the
     entrepreneurial team if applying under the provisions of paragraph  52
     of this appendix), needs to be supplied.


 27. Those statements had  to  satisfy  various  requirements  set  out  in
     (a)(ii)(1) to (7). Accordingly, the statements must be  originals  and
     not copies; the bank must be in the UK and regulated by the  Financial
     Services Authority; the money must be in cash in the account  and  not
     consist of assets such as stocks and shares; the account  must  be  in
     the applicant's own name only or both  names  for  an  entrepreneurial
     team; and not in the name of a  business  or  third  party.  The  bank
     statement must be on the institution's official stationery  confirming
     the claimant's name and,  where  relevant,  the  entrepreneurial  team
     partner's name, the account number, the date of the statement and  the
     financial institution's name and logo.


 28. In paragraph 41-SD(a)(ii)(6) it is provided that  the  bank  statement
     must have been issued by an authorised official  of  that  institution
     and produced within the three months immediately before  the  date  of
     the application.


 29. If the statements are  printouts  of  electronic  statements  from  an
     online account, they must either be accompanied by a supporting letter
     from the bank or bear the official stamp of the bank  in  question  on
     each page of the statement.


 30. With regard to the latter requirement, it is evident that  the  second
     claimant, Mr  Butt,  did  produce  to  the  secretary  of  state  bank
     statements of that nature for both the current account and  the  Every
     Day Saver Account. The statement is not on the institution's  official
     stationery. They do however contain the correct number of his accounts
     and are described as "view account entries". It appears that copies of
     that statement were produced in accordance with the requirements under
     paragraph 41-SD before the First-tier Tribunal from pages 136 onwards.
     As noted, these are updating statements for  the  period  13  December
     2012 to 12 March 2013. Statements were also produced  for  the  First-
     tier Tribunal  right  up  to  6  June  2014.  All  that  evidence  was
     inadmissible.


 31. Ms Haji produced a schedule prepared by her solicitors summarising the
     combined totals of the money available  in  each  claimant's  account.
     (Although the schedule refers to "2014"  it  is  evident  that  it  is
     intended to relate to 2013).


 32. As at 15 February 2013, the combined total was �53,223.36. The date of
     the application was 16 February 2013.


 33.  Ms  Haji  submitted  that  the  claimants  had  accordingly  met  the
     requirements with regard to access to funds. The first claimant had an
     amount in excess of �31,833 in his Halifax account on 15 January 2013.
     That evidence had been supplied to  the  respondent  as  part  of  the
     application.  Mr  Butt  also  produced  evidence  to  the  respondent,
     referred to as the "view account entries" for January 2013. He had  in
     excess of �24,500 in his current account between  17  and  23  January
     2013.


 34. Accordingly, although  Mr  Butt  did  not  present  that  evidence  in
     accordance with paragraph 41-SD(a)(ii)(5), the secretary of state  was
     nevertheless in possession of statements.


 35. Ms Haji submitted that in those circumstances, the secretary of  state
     should,  in  accordance  with  paragraph  245AA  of  the  rules,  have
     requested the claimant to produce  the  originals  before  making  the
     decision.  Copies had been made available at the time


 36. She referred to the requirement that the bank statement must have been
     issued by an authorised official of the bank and produced within three
     months immediately before the date of the  application.  It  is  clear
     that the statements were produced within the three months  immediately
     before that date.


 37. Ms Haji also submitted that the  Judge  had  accepted  the  claimants'
     evidence, and in particular their assertions that the bank  statements
     and documents referred to had been submitted to the secretary of state
     as evidence of funds. Both claimants ahd stated that they  'failed  to
     understand' how the bank statements provided  were  not  part  of  the
     bundle from the Home Office.  In  the  event,  they  produced  stamped
     printouts again to show that the funds were  available.   That  showed
     that there would have been no reason why they would not have been sent
     and accordingly supported their claim that they had been  produced  to
     the secretary of state.


 38. Similarly, the claimants contended that the cover letter  provided  by
     their  previous  solicitors  listed  the   letter   from   the   legal
     representative as required under the Appendix. It is accordingly  "not
     understandable" why the Home Office contends that this  had  not  been
     provided.


 39. Mr  Malhi  had  stated  in  his  witness  statement  that  his  former
     solicitors'  firm  was  closed  down  and  he  was  unable  to  obtain
     confirmation from them. This also applied with regard to  the  current
     appointment report. The claimants themselves took the report from  the
     Companies House website whilst at the  solicitors'  office.  That  had
     also been mentioned in  the  covering  letter.  They  had  established
     therefore that they had been appointed directors of a new business, no
     more than three months prior to the date of application. The Companies
     House report produced meant that they  met  the  specified  evidential
     requirements in that regard.


 40. He contended that if the Home Office had  mistakenly  misplaced  their
     documents and they therefore did not have them available at  the  date
     of decision, they should simply have  asked  for  further  information
     under paragraph 245AA of the rules.


 41. In his witness statement, Mr Butt stated that on 23 January  2013,  he
     had over �25,000 in his cashcard account.  Therefore,  on  that  date,
     both he and his partner had  access  to  over  �50,000  in  funds.  He
     contends that his partner had provided stamped  bank  statements  from
     his Halifax account up to 13 February 2013, showing that on 21 January
     2013 and after that date, they both had access to over  �50,000.  That
     was within three months before the date of the application.


 42. He explained that having received a call from his bank, he was advised
     not to place large amounts in the current account for lengthy periods.
     Accordingly, he transferred the sum into his Saver account,  and  then
     provided statements of that account as evidence of funds.


     Assessment


 43. In her reasons for  refusal,  the  secretary  of  state  contended  in
     respect of both claimants that there had been no letter provided  from
     the respective financial institutions where their partner's funds  are
     held to establish that those funds are accessible to both as  required
     under paragraph 41-SD(a)(i) of Appendix A.


 44. I have had regard to Table 4 under Appendix A. Each  claimant  applied
     for leave to remain on the basis that he had been last  granted  leave
     as a Tier 1 (Post Study Work) Migrant. Accordingly, they had  to  show
     that on a date falling within the three months  immediately  prior  to
     the date of application that they had registered  with  HMRC  as  self
     employed or registered a new business in which he is  a  director,  or
     registered as a director of an existing business. In addition,  it  is
     provided that they must have access to not less than �50,000  -  Table
     4(d)(v).


 45. Although the secretary of state contends in the refusal  reasons  that
     Table 4(d) requires that the applicant must have access  to  not  less
     than �50,000 on a date falling within  the  three  months  immediately
     prior to the date of application, it is evident that the  three  month
     requirement, as seen from its context under Table 4(d)(iii) relates to
     the registration requirements which I have set out. The access to  not
     less than �50,000 is a separate requirement under the Table.


 46. Furthermore, the claimants are relying on  paragraph  41-SD(a)(ii)  of
     Appendix A as the money that they hold is in the UK only. Accordingly,
     the letter referred to at paragraph  41-SD(a)(i)  does  not  apply  to
     their application. As noted 41-SD(a)(ii) is  in  the  alternative  and
     relates to monies held in the UK bank accounts.


 47. It is provided in 41-SD(a)(ii) that the bank statement must have  been
     issued by an authorised official  of  that  institution  and  produced
     within the three months immediately before the date of application.


 48. It is evident that the bank statements relied on evidencing access  to
     �50,000 were produced within the three months immediately  before  the
     date of the application. The schedule produced by the  claimants,  and
     which has not been disputed, indicates that  as  at  15  January  2013
     onwards the claimants had access to cash in excess of �50,000.


 49. The evidence produced to the secretary of state by Mr Butt with regard
     to his respective Barclays accounts were however  not  in  a  form  as
     specified by paragraph 41-SD of Appendix A.


 50. In those  circumstances,  the  claimant  had  failed  to  produce  the
     appropriate specified evidence.


 51. The document they submitted in that respect was in the  wrong  format,
     alternatively, the document is a copy and not the original. I have had
     regard to version 2.0 of  the  guidance  relating  to  PDS  Evidential
     Flexibility. This sets out documents which it may be  appropriate  for
     the case worker to request. Those in respect of Tier  1  Entrepreneurs
     refers to evidence that is copied instead  of  an  original.  It  also
     includes missing information from the required  letters  or  documents
     which cannot be readily ascertained by the case worker.


 52. The secretary of state contended in the refusal letters  that  despite
     the production of bank statements by Mr Butt up to 23 January 2013, he
     had less than �50,000 on any given day in the three  months  preceding
     the application.


 53. It is also contended that his team member, Mr Malhi, had supplied bank
     statements from 17 September 2012 to 15 January 2013,  which  together
     with his own savings totalled less than �50,000 on any  given  day  in
     the three months preceding his application.


 54. However, on 15 January 2013, Mr Malhi had a  closing  balance  in  his
     Halifax account in the amount of �31,833.31. The respondent  also  had
     regard to Mr Butt's saver account from 18  June  2012  to  23  January
     2013. The secretary  of  state  contended  that  their  joint  savings
     totalled less than �50,000 on  any  given  day  in  the  three  months
     preceding their application. However, as indicated, the combined total
     of the claimants' funds was in excess of �50,000 from 15 January 2013.




 55. As required in paragraph 41-SD(a)(ii)(6),  the  bank  statements  must
     have been issued and produced within three months  immediately  before
     the date of the application.


 56. There was accordingly evidence produced showing that the claimants had
     access to not less than �50,000 as confirmed by bank statements issued
     by an authorised official of the  respective  banks,  and  which  were
     produced within the three months immediately before the  date  of  the
     application.


 57. Judge Lobo found that each claimant had in excess of �25,000 in  their
     respective bank accounts with Halifax and Barclays. Accordingly,  they
     fulfilled the requirements of Appendix A  and  insofar  as  the  first
     claimant is concerned, Appendix C as well.


 58. At the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal, the claimants  produced
     bank statements in proper form. That evidence post dated the  date  of
     decision. It is evident that Judge Lobo accepted that  evidence,  even
     though it was not admissible. The bank statements for example produced
     by Mr Malhi related to the company's account. Mr Butt produced  copies
     of his Barclays statements in proper form. However, the originals were
     not produced.


 59. Judge Lobo, without any reasoning, accepted  that  the  claimants  had
     shown access to funds in the required amount. However, he did not make
     an explicit finding as to whether the bank statements  submitted  with
     the application demonstrated possession of the necessary funds on  any
     one given day.


 60. I have also had regard to the application forms of each  claimant,  in
     which they have identified their respective bank  accounts  contending
     that each had at least �25,000 in their account so that the  total  of
     money available to them was at least  �50,000.   Bank  statements  had
     been submitted at the time, albeit not in proper form.


 61. The secretary of state did have evidence from Mr Malhi that as  at  15
     January 2013, he had  �31,833.31  in  his  Halifax  account.  Mr  Butt
     produced evidence to the respondent showing that he held �24,562.83 in
     his Every Day Saver account.


 62. Accordingly, apart from the account being in the incorrect format, the
     evidence produced to the secretary of state indicated that from  about
     17 January 2013 onwards, amounts in excess of �50,000 were held  as  a
     combined total.


 63. The claimants had however not produced the originals of  that  account
     which is a requirement under  paragraph  41-SD  as  referred  to.  The
     originals have since been produced.  They are however  not  admissible
     evidence.


 64. In the circumstances, they should have been given  an  opportunity  to
     produce the originals of that bank  statement.  To  that  extent,  the
     decision was not in accordance with the law and the immigration rules.


 65. Mr Butt  has  produced  original  bank  statements  from  Barclays  in
     compliance with paragraph 41-SD covering the same period as the copies
     sent to the secretary of state, namely account entries from 1  January
     2012 to 23  January  2013  in  the  Every  Day  Saver  account  number
     33068195, sort code 20-44-22. It appears  that  Mr  Butt  also  had  a
     current account 73711358 with sort code 20-20-20, which is a different
     account to the Every Day Saver account referred to.


 66. The findings of Judge Lobo were not supported  by  full  reasons.   He
     allowed the appeals outright under the Rules without proper  analysis.
     However, the appeal should only  have  been  allowed  to  the  limited
     extent that the decision was not in accordance with  the  law  as  the
     claimants had not been given the opportunity of producing the original
     bank statements referred to. The combined total  in  their  respective
     accounts however appeared to exceed �50,000 from at least  21  January
     2013.


 67. The making of the decision by the First-tier Judge thus  involved  the
     making of an error on a point of law.


 68. I accordingly set aside the determination of the  First-tier  Tribunal
     and remake it by  substituting  a  decision  allowing  the  claimants'
     appeals to the limited extent on  the  basis  that  the  secretary  of
     state's decision was not in accordance with  the  law.  The  claimants
     accordingly await the making of a lawful decision.


           No anonymity direction is made.
