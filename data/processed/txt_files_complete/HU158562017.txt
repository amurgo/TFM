For the Appellant:     Mr Brissett (Legal Representative)
For the Respondent:    Mr Melvin (Senior Home Office Presenting Officer)

                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. This is the Appellant's appeal  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge Carroll promulgated on the 28th February 2019, in which
      she dismissed the Appellant's appeal against the Respondent's decision
      to refuse her entry clearance on Human Rights grounds.


   2. The Appellant Mrs Fabian is a Nigerian citizen. Her sponsor, Mr  [SF],
      is a British citizen.  On the 5th December 2016, the Appellant  sought
      entry clearance to the  United  Kingdom  as  Mr  [F]'s  spouse.   That
      application was refused by the Respondent in a decision  letter  dated
      the 12th October 2017, on the grounds  that  the  Respondent  was  not
      satisfied that the Appellant and her sponsor were  in  a  genuine  and
      subsisting relationship or that  they  intended  to  live  permanently
      together in the United Kingdom. The Respondent also was not  satisfied
      that  the  sponsor  met  the  minimum  income  requirements   of   the
      Immigration Rules. It was said that the Appellant  had  not  submitted
      any sponsor finance documentation and had not  completed  an  Appendix
      II.  The Respondent was further not satisfied that the  sponsor  would
      be adequately accommodated in the UK without recourse to public funds.




   3. That decision was appealed to the First-tier Tribunal, and that appeal
      was heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge Carroll at Taylor House on  the
      15th  February  2019,  who  although  being  satisfied  regarding  the
      genuineness  and  subsisting  nature  of  the  relationship  and   the
      accommodation  and  the  English  language   requirements,   was   not
      satisfied, when considering the Article 8 claim initially through  the
      lens of the Immigration Rules that the Appellant had demonstrated that
      the financial requirements of Appendix FM were met.  The Judge went on
      to find that there were no exceptional or compelling circumstances  to
      mean that the  decision  was  disproportionate  for  the  purposes  of
      Article 8 outside of the Rules, such as to amount to a breach  of  the
      Appellant's Human Rights.  The First-tier Tribunal Judge found that:


           "The sponsor is in a salaried employment and must demonstrate an
           income of  a  minimum  of  �18,600.   The  material  period  for
           documentation relating to his employment is six months prior  to
           the date of application in December 2016.  In his oral  evidence
           the  sponsor  said  that  all  of  the  documentation  had  been
           submitted with the Visa Application Form.   I  have  no  way  of
           verifying this.  However, the employment documentation  relating
           to the sponsor which appears at page 12  and  following  of  the
           principal bundle does not cover the relevant period.   There  is
           one letter of the 1st July 2016 on the headed paper  of  Barratt
           London in which it is said that the sponsor's salary with effect
           from the 1st July 2016 will be �20,910  per  annum.   There  are
           also two offers of employment; one of these is  dated  the  16th
           October 2017 and there is also a contract  of  employment  dated
           the 13th October 2018 (page 12).  The bundle also contains a P60
           for the sponsor but this is for the tax year to  the  5th  April
           2015.  There are also a number of  payslips  but  none  for  the
           period July to December 2016.  I note also that a  large  number
           of the payslips submitted (for 2017) do not show  the  sponsor's
           name.

           6.    In the light of this very limited evidence, the  Appellant
           does  not  satisfy  the  financial  requirement  provisions   of
           Appendix FM (E-ECP.3.1)".

   4. Within the Grounds of Appeal it  is  argued  that  the  Learned  Judge
      failed to place adequate or sufficient weight on the documents  placed
      before her, especially a document dated the 1st July 2016 at  page  17
      of the bundle from Barratt London, which i stated that  the  sponsor's
      salary had been reviewed with effect from the 1st July 2016 and  would
      be �20,910 per annum representing a 2% increase.  This is said to show
      that the sponsor met the �18,600 threshold  before  the  date  of  the
      application in December 2016.  It is argued that the  Judge's  failure
      to take account of that letter resulted in a material error of law and
      that further the sponsor's  2016  payslips  showed  that  he  met  the
      financial threshold. It is argued that all of the required information
      including letters  from  employers,  payslips  and  Tax  Returns  were
      provided before making the application.  It is argued that  the  Judge
      failed to consider payslips from Barratt for the  period  between  the
      24th June 2016 to December 2016.  It was further argued that the Judge
      failed to consider the payslips from the 24th  June  2016  to  October
      2017 and the salary increase.  It was further argued  that  the  Judge
      failed to consider all the  Halifax  bank  statements  from  May  2016
      evidencing the sponsor's salary. It is argued  that  the  decision  is
      wrong, unfair and unreasonable in the "Wednesbury sense" and that  the
      Appellant should have been given the benefit of  the  doubt.   It  was
      further argued that the Judge failed to strike a fair balance for  the
      purposes of Article 8.


   5. Within the Appellant's Skeleton Argument it is further argued that the
      issue is the financial requirements of Appendix FM and whether or  not
      the financial criteria had been satisfied by  the  Appellant  and  her
      sponsor. It is further argued the Appellant and her sponsor's  Article
      8 rights will need to be considered.  It is argued that the  Appellant
      and sponsor have  undergone  emotional  anguish  through  the  appeals
      process. It is said that the First-tier Judge was not assisted at  the
      hearing as there  was  no  Respondent's  bundle  before  her  and  the
      Secretary of State was not represented at the hearing.  It  is  argued
      that the Appellant and her sponsor  have  fully  complied  with  legal
      requirements and that she should be allowed to  enjoy  her  Article  8
      rights with her sponsor and that the failure of  the  Home  Office  to
      furnish a bundle or a representative  should  not  be  blamed  on  the
      Appellant.  The Upper Tribunal was invited to substitute its  decision
      in place of the one made by Judge Carroll and to allow the appeal.


   6.  Although  permission  to  appeal  was  initially  refused,   it   was
      subsequently granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Reeds on  the  20th  June
      2019, who found that the grounds asserted that the Judge erred in  her
      approach to the assessment of the sponsor's financial circumstances by
      failing to take into account evidence relevant to the requisite period
      under Appendix FM-SE and also later evidence that had  been  provided.
      She granted permission on the basis that it was unclear what  material
      had been before the Judge and whether in the circumstances  there  had
      been an error of approach on assessing the evidence, which might  have
      had a material bearing  on  the  outcome.   It  was  stated  that  the
      Appellant's representative would be required to demonstrate  what  had
      been before the Judge at the hearing date.  It was only on that  basis
      that permission to appeal was granted.


   7. I am most grateful to Mr Melvin for having provided a  Rule  24  Reply
      dated  the  31st  July  2019.   It  is  therein  stated  that  due  to
      operational difficulties the Respondent did not attend the  First-tier
      Tribunal hearing.  It was acknowledged by the Respondent  that  if  it
      could be shown that there was cogent evidence  before  the  First-tier
      Tribunal that the financial requirements of Appendix FM-SE were met in
      the six months  prior  to  the  application  (July-December  2016)  as
      asserted in the Grounds of Appeal  then  the  appeal  should  succeed,
      given  all  of  the  other  areas  appeared  satisfied.   However  the
      Respondent opposed the appeal and submitted that  the  Judge  directed
      herself appropriately.


   8. In addition to the Grounds of Appeal and the Skeleton Argument and the
      Rule 24 Reply, I also heard  oral  submissions  from  Mr  Brissett  on
      behalf of the Appellant and Mr Melvin, Senior Home  Office  Presenting
      Officer on behalf of the Secretary of State.  Mr Brissett argued  that
      all of the required information had been submitted to the Home  Office
      with the application and that the Appellant should  not  suffer  as  a
      result of the Respondent having failed  to  produce  a  bundle  or  to
      attend at the First-tier Tribunal hearing.  He further argued that the
      First-tier Tribunal Judge had the  sponsor's  contract  of  employment
      showing his level of employment prior to the application and that  the
      Judge failed to give sufficient weight to  it.   He  argued  that  the
      decision was both irrational and unfair.


   9. He said that there was no criticism of Judge Carroll in not  having  a
      full bundle, and conceded  that  the  payslips  contained  within  the
      Appellant's bundle as stated by Judge Carroll  appeared  to  have  the
      name of the employee missing at the top, but he argued that  that  was
      simply an error in photocopying, and that only part of the wage  slips
      had been photocopied rather than the entire wage slips. He stated  the
      back of the wage slips also had not been photocopied. He said that  he
      had checked the employee reference number, which he  said  related  to
      the sponsor.  He asked me to allow the  appeal,  submitting  that  the
      court ought to carry out a proportionality exercise for  the  purposes
      of Article 8.


  10. Mr Melvin submitted that the grant of permission to  appeal  had  been
      specific in nature and that it was for  the  Appellant  to  show  what
      documentation was before the First-tier Tribunal  and  submitted  that
      the Judge could only decide the appeal on the basis  of  the  evidence
      that she had before her.


   My Findings on Error of Law and Materiality


  11. Although the Appellant has  now  sought  to  submit  further  bundles,
      following the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Carroll  including
      a 54-page bundle sent to the Tribunal on  the  21st  May  2019  and  a
      further 93-page bundle sent to the Tribunal on  the  26th  July  2019,
      which contain  payslips,  P60  and  bank  statements.  However,  these
      bundles were not before First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Carroll  when  she
      made her decision.  The only bundle of evidence before  Judge  Carroll
      when she made her decision was the original Appellant's bundle running
      to 190 pages.  As she correctly stated in her decision the sponsor had
      said that all the documentation  had  been  submitted  with  the  visa
      application form, but she had no way of verifying that.


  12.  Having read her decision it is clear that the judge did take  account
      of the letter of the 1st July 2016 saying that  the  sponsor's  salary
      with effect from the 1st July 2016 would be �20,910, and took  account
      of the employment letter dated the 16th October 2017 and the  contract
      of employment dated the 13th October 2018, together with the  contract
      of  employment  with  HML  Concierge,  in  respect  of  the  sponsor's
      employment from the 13th October 2018.  The  Judge  also  noted  quite
      correctly that the bundle contained a P60 for the sponsor for the  tax
      year ending the 5th April 2016 and that within the bundle that she had
      before her, there were no payslips relating to the period for the  six
      months prior to the application between July to December 2016 and that
      a large number of the payslips submitted in  2017  did  not  show  the
      sponsor's name.  That is now agreed by the Appellant,  who  says  that
      that was a photocopying error.  However,  although  Mr  Brissett  says
      that he had checked the  employee  number  and  that  relates  to  the
      sponsor, there  was  no  evidence  before  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
      Carroll to show to whom those payslips for 2017 related.  There is  no
      way that she would have known if that employee  reference  related  to
      the sponsor.


  13. Judge Carroll correctly found that she did not  have  wage  slips  for
      July to December 2016.   Therefore,  when  initially  considering  the
      Article 8 claim through the lens of the Immigration Rules,  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge Carroll quite correctly found that  the  Appellant  did
      not satisfy the financial provisions of Appendix FM in that regard  as
      the specified evidence  in  Appendix  FM-SE  had  not  been  provided.
      Although clearly being a Human Rights claim, the court was considering
      the application  as  at  the  date  of  the  hearing,  when  initially
      considering the application through the lens of the Immigration Rules,
      the court did have to consider what evidence there was and whether  or
      not the specified evidence was available to establish the level of the
      sponsor's  income.   The  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  did  not   have
      sufficient evidence to show that the  provisions  of  the  Immigration
      Rules were met.  She  was  also  entitled  to  find  that  although  a
      subsequent employment of contract had been provided, the payslips from
      2017 did not show to whom they related.


  14. It is  for  the  Appellant  to  prove  her  case  on  the  balance  of
      probabilities, it was not for the  Respondent  to  disprove  it.   The
      Appellant was represented at the  appeal  hearing,  and  seemingly  no
      request was made for any adjournment in order to be  able  to  provide
      further documentation, or to be able to  obtain  clarification  as  to
      what  documentation  was  submitted  with  the  application   to   the
      Respondent.  I was told by Mr Brissett that the  Appellant  asked  for
      the appeal to go ahead before Judge Carroll despite the non-attendance
      of any representative on behalf of the Secretary of State and the lack
      of the Respondent's bundle, and in such circumstances the Judge  could
      only decide the case on the evidence presented before her.


  15. The existence of simply the employer's letter from the 1st July  2016,
      would be insufficient to establish that the financial  requirement  of
      Appendix FM-SE were met, without evidence of the requisite wage  slips
      and proof of payments into the bank account.  The decision  of  First-
      tier Tribunal Judge Carroll does not disclose any  material  error  of
      law, and the Judge made findings which were perfectly open to  her  on
      the evidence presented to her.


  16. Although Mr Brissett asked me to take account of  the  further  bundle
      submitted, in which full copies  of  the  wage  slips  were  provided,
      together with wage slips for the requisite period,  as  stated  above,
      there was no evidence that these documents were  actually  before  the
      First-tier  Tribunal  Judge,  therefore  I  have  no  jurisdiction  to
      consider those, whilst initially considering whether or not the First-
      tier Tribunal Judge had materially erred.  Until  the  Upper  Tribunal
      considers that the First-tier Tribunal Judge has made a material error
      of law, it is not in a position to consider further evidence, such  as
      to undertake a re-hearing.


  17. It is clearly open to the Appellant and her sponsor to make a  further
      application for entry clearance, submitting fresh evidence to show the
      rules are met now.  However, in the absence of any  evidence  to  show
      that the First-tier Tribunal Judge made a material error of  law,  the
      Upper  Tribunal  has  no  discretion  simply  to  substitute  its  own
      assessment based on the new evidence submitted.






Notice of Decision


The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge  Carroll  does  not  disclose  any
material error of law and is maintained.


I make no Order in respect of anonymity, no such Order  having  been  sought
before the First-tier Tribunal Judge or before me.
