                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1) This is an appeal with permission against a decision by  Judge  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal Pygott allowing an appeal both under Article 8  and
    also on the grounds that the Secretary of State's decision was  not  in
    accordance with the law.   The  appeal  was  dismissed  on  asylum  and
    humanitarian protection grounds and under Articles 2 and 3.  Before the
    Upper Tribunal  the  appellant  is  the  Secretary  of  State  and  the
    respondent, Mr Muhamed Ali Nuhu is  hereinafter  referred  to  as  "the
    claimant".

 2) The claimant was born on 27 August 1960 and is a national of  Tanzania,
    originating from the island of Zanzibar.  The claimant has been in  the
    UK since December 1995, when he claimed asylum.  His asylum  claim  was
    refused in 1997 and a subsequent appeal was dismissed in 1999.  In  the
    asylum appeal in 1999 it seems that the  adjudicator  accepted  to  the
    lower standard of proof that the claimant had been active  in  politics
    in Zanzibar and had faced detention  by  the  police.   After  he  left
    Zanzibar, however, he lived in Dar-es-Salaam, where he had stayed  with
    an  uncle  for  two  months.   The  adjudicator  did  not  believe  the
    claimant's evidence that throughout this time  he  had  never  ventured
    outside, or that movements in every locality were monitored.

 3) It appears that following the unsuccessful appeal in 1999 the  claimant
    was due to be removed but removal was postponed to allow  the  claimant
    to make further representations.  These were not accepted, however,  as
    a fresh claim.  There was then a period between 2000 and 2008 when  the
    claimant was not in contact with the Secretary of State.  It seems that
    around the end of 2008 the claimant made an application  for  leave  to
    remain on the basis of 14 years' residence.  This was  refused  by  the
    respondent on the basis that removal  directions  had  been  issued  in
    1999.  It was pointed out  in  response  on  behalf  of  the  claimant,
    however, that the application had also included claims  under  Articles
    2, 3 and 8 and these had not been  addressed  by  the  respondent.   It
    seems the respondent did not make a decision on the human rights claims
    made in 2008 until May 2014.  It was a removal  decision  made  in  May
    2014 which gave rise to the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal.

 4) So far as the asylum grounds were concerned, the Judge  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal noted that before coming to the UK the claimant had  been
    able to live in the mainland of Tanzania with his uncle for two  months
    without  experiencing  problems.   He  left  Tanzania  using  his   own
    passport.  The judge considered that in the highly unlikely event  that
    the authorities in Zanzibar were still  looking  for  the  claimant  he
    would be able to relocate elsewhere, particular as he had stayed on the
    mainland, bearing in mind that, as the claimant  acknowledged,  he  had
    been out of the country for nearly 19 years.

 5) The Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  then  turned  to  the  Article  8
    grounds.  The judge found that the claimant has no family life  in  the
    UK as he has no relatives here.  There was not a great deal of evidence
    of private life in the UK.  The claimant still had family  in  Tanzania
    with  whom  he  was  in  contact   either   directly   or   indirectly.
    Nevertheless he had been in the UK for 18� years and has friends  here.
    The judge therefore accepted that the claimant has a  private  life  in
    the UK and that Article 8 was engaged.

 6) The judge went on to find that the claimant was in continual touch with
    the respondent either directly or through various solicitors and his MP
    from November 2008.  In 2009 the claimant sought consideration  of  his
    case under the Legacy Programme and the  Secretary  of  State  accepted
    that the case  was  eligible  under  this  programme.   The  judge  was
    particularly concerned by a six year delay by the Secretary of State in
    dealing with the claimants human rights  claims  and  referred  to  the
    decision of the House of Lords in EB  (Kosovo)  [2008]  UKHL  41.   The
    judge concluded that the delay by the Secretary  of  State  in  dealing
    with the claimant's case  tipped  the  balance  of  proportionality  in
    favour of the claimant because the delay was "indicative  of  a  system
    that was dysfunctional".

 7) The Judge of the First-tier Tribunal then went on to  consider  whether
    the Secretary  of  State's  decision,  against  which  the  appeal  was
    brought, was in accordance with the law.  The Secretary  of  State  had
    referred in the reasons for refusal letter to  paragraph  353B  of  the
    Immigration Rules, which applied where  a  person  was  facing  removal
    after the consideration of further submissions  made  by  that  person.
    The judge found that in considering the claimant's case under paragraph
    353B the Secretary of State had  misapprehended  material  facts.   The
    claimant had been seeking to  comply  with  immigration  control  since
    2008, not 2010 as alleged by the Secretary of State, and there had been
    a delay in making a decision by the Secretary  of  State  of  5�  years
    rather  than  3�  years.   This  delay  had  occurred   notwithstanding
    exhortations by or on behalf of the claimant for his case to  be  dealt
    with.

 8) In the application for permission to  appeal  the  Secretary  of  State
    challenged the judge's conclusions under Article 8 by reference to  the
    case of Nasim [2014] UKUT 00025 and the decision of the  Supreme  Court
    in Patel [2013] UKSC72.  According to the Upper Tribunal in Nasim,  the
    case of Patel recognised Article 8's limited utility  in  private  life
    cases that were far removed from protection of  an  individual's  moral
    and physical integrity.  The Secretary of State pointed  out  that  the
    judge had made no  reference  to  the  claimant's  moral  and  physical
    integrity and had failed to make any direction in relation to the  case
    of Nasim.  The claimant's private life did not reach the high threshold
    required to remain in the UK in accordance with Nasim.  Delay could not
    be determinative on its own.  In addition, the judge erred in remitting
    the case back to the  Secretary  of  State  for  reconsideration  under
    paragraph 353B.

 9) At the hearing before me Mr Walker, for the Secretary of State,  relied
    on the grounds set out in the application  for  permission  to  appeal.
    The first ground was a failure to consider private life properly and to
    give effect to the case of Nasim.  There was no interference  with  the
    claimant's physical or moral integrity.  The claimant still had ties to
    Tanzania and he had no family life in the UK.  The  judge  had  further
    erred in seeking to allow the appeal as not in accordance with the  law
    under paragraph 353B.  Taken together these points showed confusion and
    ambiguity in relation to the findings made.

10) For the claimant, Miss Howorth accepted that the judge had not directed
    herself towards Nasim.  That case was concerned primarily with  foreign
    students applying for leave for post-study work.     The  circumstances
    of the current claimant could be distinguished from  the  circumstances
    under consideration in Nasim and the claimant was towards the other end
    of the scale from the appellants in that case.  The Secretary of  State
    had a policy for legacy cases and in the light of that  policy  it  was
    not appropriate for the judge to have referred specifically  to  Nasim.
    Even had the judge done so the outcome was  likely  to  have  been  the
    same.

11) The point was raised as  to  whether  the  claimant  had  suffered  any
    prejudice from the delay by the Secretary of State in dealing with  his
    claim and whether the claimant had failed to attend for removal in 1999
    as he was expected to do.  Reference was made to paragraph 34, in which
    the case of EB (Kosovo) was mentioned.  At the time  the  claimant  was
    due to be removed in  1999  his  solicitors  were  in  touch  with  the
    Secretary of State and they advised the  claimant  not  to  attend  for
    removal because they were in the process of making an appeal.  This was
    pointed out in the claimant's witness statement.   The  judge  did  not
    reject this explanation.

12) Mr Walker submitted  that  there  was  no  specific  reference  in  the
    determination to the case law in respect of the Legacy Programme.

Discussion

13) I have carefully considered the arguments advanced  on  behalf  of  the
    Secretary of State in seeking to challenge the judge's  decision  under
    Article 8.  It seems to me that the difficulty  for  the  Secretary  of
    State is in showing that the judge reached a  decision  which  was  not
    open to her upon the facts as found by her.  The main issue  raised  by
    the Secretary of State in this  regard  was  that  the  judge  did  not
    properly direct herself by reference to the case of  Nasim.   I  accept
    the submission by Ms Howorth,  however,  that  this  decision  was  not
    entirely in point so far as the  circumstances  of  this  claimant  are
    concerned.  The judge properly followed the Razgar steps and had regard
    to the case of EB (Kosovo), which is a decision of the House  of  Lords
    relevant to the question of delay by the  Secretary  of  State  in  the
    consideration of a claim.  In essence the judge found that a  delay  by
    the Secretary  of  State  of  nearly  6  years  in  responding  to  the
    claimant's human rights claim, by which time the claimant had  been  in
    the UK for over  18  years,  was  sufficient  to  tip  the  balance  of
    proportionality in favour of the claimant.  This was a conclusion which
    the judge was entitled to reach for the reasons which were given.

14) The Secretary of State asserted in the application  for  permission  to
    appeal that there was no private life that would qualify under  Article
    8 on a "stand alone basis" and that delay cannot  be  determinative  on
    its own.  The decision of the judge, however, was that he  duration  of
    residence combined with the delay in considering the  claimant's  human
    rights claim  together  rendered  the  Secretary  of  State's  decision
    disproportionate.  This was as already stated, a decision the judge was
    entitled to make.

15) Where I take issue with the Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal  was  in
    allowing the appeal on the basis that it was not in accordance with the
    law, for the reason that the  Secretary  of  State  had  misapprehended
    material facts when considering the appeal under paragraph 353B.  As  I
    read the effect of that provision, had the Secretary of  State  made  a
    decision in favour of the claimant under paragraph 353B this would have
    led to no different outcome from a decision in favour of  the  claimant
    under Article 8.  In other words, after the judge found  in  favour  of
    the claimant under Article 8 it was no  longer  necessary  to  consider
    also the effect of paragraph 353B.  The decision of the judge to  allow
    the appeal to the limited extent that the decision under paragraph 353B
    was not in accordance with the law is to an extent  contradictory  with
    the decision allowing  the  appeal  under  Article  8  and  results  in
    uncertainty and possible inconsistency.  For this reason I accept  that
    the judge erred in allowing the appeal on the ground that the Secretary
    of State's decision was not in accordance with  the  law  and  on  this
    point only I would amend the decision by dismissing the appeal on  this
    ground.

16) On the principal issue, however, the judge was entitled  to  allow  the
    appeal under Article 8 and the  judge's  decision  is  upheld  on  this
    ground.

17) The judge made an order for anonymity on the basis that the claimant is
    an asylum seeker and to protect the privacy and safety of him  and  his
    family.  The asylum claim is no  longer  of  any  significance  to  the
    outcome of the appeal and I do not consider that the facts as found  by
    the judge suggest that the claimant's family would be  in  any  danger.
    Accordingly, I will vary the anonymity order and lift it.

18) The judge of the First-tier Tribunal further found that no fee was paid
    or payable and therefore there could be no fee award.  This  aspect  of
    the decision remains unchanged.

Conclusions

19) The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law insofar  as  the  judge  erred  in
    allowing the appeal on the basis that the Secretary of State's decision
    was not in accordance with the law.

20) The decision is set aside to this limited extent only.  The decision by
    the judge allowing the appeal under Article 8 shall stand.

Anonymity

21) The First-tier Tribunal made an anonymity order  and  for  the  reasons
    given above I lift that order.
