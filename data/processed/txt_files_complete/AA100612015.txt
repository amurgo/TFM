                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, a citizen of Albania born in June 1998, arrived  in  the
    United Kingdom in November 2014  and  claimed  asylum.  His  claim  was
    refused by the respondent on 19 June 2015 and he appealed against  that
    decision. His appeal was heard by the First-tier  Tribunal  and,  in  a
    decision promulgated on 24 May 2016, was dismissed on all grounds.

 2. Following a grant of permission to appeal against that decision, it was
    found, at an error of law hearing on 27 July 2016, that the  First-tier
    Tribunal had made errors of law  in  its  decision.  The  decision  was
    accordingly set aside and directions made for it to be re-made.

 3. In a consent order signed by both parties, and in an accompanying email
    from Mr Deller  of  the  Home  Office  dated  23  September  2016,  the
    respondent requested the Tribunal's consent for the withdrawal  of  the
    respondent's case that the appellant was not entitled to refugee status
    and gave consent to the Tribunal  summarily  allowing  the  appellant's
    appeal on the basis that the decision under appeal was contrary to  the
    United Kingdom's obligations under the Refugee Convention.

 4. In light of the above, the appellant's appeal is allowed on  the  basis
    that his  removal  from  the  UK  would  breach  the  United  Kingdom's
    obligations under the Refugee Convention.



DECISION

 5. The original Tribunal was found to have made an error of law. I re-make
    the decision by allowing the appellant's appeal.
