Representation

For the Appellant:     Mr Z Nasim, Counsel instructed by Pioneer Solicitors


For the Claimant: Mr P Duffy, Senior Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant appeals with permission against the  decision  of  First-
    tier  Tribunal  Judge  Clark  dismissing   the   appeal   against   the
    Respondent's decision to refuse leave as a Tier 4 (General) student and
    removal directions under section 47  of  the  Immigration,  Asylum  and
    Nationality Act 2006.




 2. The Appellant appealed against the decision  of  Judge  Clark  and  was
    granted permission to appeal by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Andrew.  The
    basis upon which permission was granted may be summarised as follows:


      i) The Appellant did not and does not have a CAS and therefore  cannot
         meet the requirements of the Rules in relation to  his  application
         as a Tier 4 student, however it is an arguable error of law for the
         Judge to have made no findings in relation to the allegations under
         paragraph 322(1A) of the Immigration Rules which is relevant to any
         future applications the Appellant may make.  It  was  not  arguable
         that the judge did not consider Article 8 ECHR when it  was  not  a
         ground of appeal before him.






 3. I was provided with a Rule 24 response from the Respondent wherein  she
    appeared to accept that the judge was obliged to make findings  on  the
    matter of paragraph 322(1A) which, on the evidence  before  the  judge,
    demonstrated that the Respondent had not discharged the burden of proof
    and therefore the appeal against that part of the refusal  should  have
    been upheld.





    Discussion


 4. At the close of submissions, I indicated that although  there  appeared
    to be an error of law as stated in the Rule 24 Reply my decision  would
    follow in writing. That decision follows hereafter. I find  that  there
    was an error of law in the decision such that it should be  set  aside.
    My reasons for so finding are as follows.





 5. In relation to the Rule 24 Reply, Mr Duffy confirmed that the
    concessions made within were maintained and should be taken as read. Mr
    Duffy accepted that the judge should have made findings in relation to
    the paragraph 322(1A) reason for refusal. Mr Nasim indicated that there
    was no basis to support the judge's conclusion at �12 that he was
    unable to make any finding in relation to the assertion of supplying a
    false ESOL certificate in light of the statement earlier at �7 that
    there was no further evidence to adduce from the Respondent and no
    information as to the basis for the assertion that the ESOL certificate
    was false.


 6. Both advocates agreed that the 322(1A) matter should be disposed of in
    the Appellant's favour in light of the failure by the Respondent to
    provide any evidence discharging the burden of proving the assertion of
    falsity.


 7. Mr Nasim attempted to persuade me to consider other errors of law in
    the decision; however, given that the solicitors for the Appellant did
    not seek to renew the grounds for permission in light of the limited
    nature of the grant by Judge Andrew, I was not minded to entertain such
    a late application.

 8. Given that both advocates were in agreement that the failure to decide
    the paragraph 322(1A) matter amounted to a discrete error in the
    decision and both agreed that that issue should be remade in the
    Appellant's favour, I could discern no reason not to follow the course
    that they jointly proposed and requested me to follow.

    Error of Law
 9. In light of the above agreement and concession by the Respondent, I
    find that the decision of Judge Clark involved the making of an error
    of law in relation to the discrete issue of paragraph 322(1A) and
    consequently, I set aside paragraph 12 of the decision alone.



10. I reach this conclusion due to the discussion above and given that the
    Respondent accepts that the matter should have been addressed as
    material to future applications and that it should fall to be decided
    in the Appellant's favour. I also noted that this formed a ground of
    appeal and consequently, the issue should have been decided to provide
    a comprehensive decision and to assist both parties in relation to a
    previous allegation of falsity, which would have a material impact on a
    future application that Mr Nasim indicated his client would likely
    make.




11. I find that in the absence of any evidence demonstrating falsity in the
    ESOL certificate either before the First-tier Tribunal or before me
    that the Respondent has, as she admits, failed to discharge the burden
    of proof upon her and consequently this limb of the appeal falls to
    succeed as the Respondent has not proven that the either the ESOL
    document was false, nor that the Appellant used deception.




12. However, as the Appellant was not given permission to challenge the
    findings in relation to his inability to submit a CAS, the appeal still
    unfortunately fails. Nonetheless, the Appellant is of course entitled
    to make a further application within 28 days of this appeal coming to a
    close, should he be so advised.





    Decision

13. The appeal to the Upper Tribunal is allowed.




14. Paragraph 12 of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  is  set  aside
    concerning the conclusion on paragraph 322(1A). The Appellant's  appeal
    is remade in relation to that discrete issue in the Appellant's favour.
    However, the appeal must still fail as in the absence  of  a  CAS,  the
    Appellant failed to meet the Immigration Rules.




15. The remaining findings and decision of Judge Clark are preserved.


    Anonymity

16. The First-tier Tribunal did not make an  anonymity  order.  I  was  not
    invited to make any such order and in any event, I  see  no  reason  to
    make such an order.






    Fee Award


17. As the appeal remains refused, the Appellant remains  unentitled  to  a
    fee award.
