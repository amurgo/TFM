Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr T Royston of Counsel instructed by Switalskis
                    Solicitors Huddersfield
For the Respondent:    Mr M Diwnycz, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Iraq whose date of birth is  recorded  as
    5th March 1990.   On  29th  September  2015  he  made  application  for
    international protection as a refugee. On 7th January 2016  a  decision
    was made to refuse the application and the Appellant appealed.  On 23rd
    September 2016 his appeal was heard by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal
    Pickup sitting at Manchester.

 2. The basis of the claim was that following  the  death  of  his  father,
    caused by an ISIS bomb detonated in his cafï¿½, he approached  the  local
    government on several occasions to seek compensation which was refused.
     In consequence, he and others  denied  compensation,  twice  attending
    protests against the refusal to grant it.  During the  second  protest,
    which  he  attended  with  his  mother  and  sister,  the   authorities
    intervened with the  result  that  a  person  was  killed  and  others,
    including friends of his, were arrested.  The Appellant  escaped.   His
    mother and sister returned home but he, the  Appellant,  went  to  stay
    with a friend in Sulaymaniyah.  Approximately  30  minutes  after  they
    left  the  demonstration  his  mother  and  uncle  contacted  him,  the
    Appellant, to warn him not to return as the  authorities  were  looking
    for him.   The  Appellant  was  advised  to  leave  the  country  which
    eventually he did.

 3. Material to the findings of the judge were: whether the Appellant had a
    Civil Status Identification Document (CSID); whether one might  readily
    be obtainable; and whether return was feasible in the Appellant's case.
     Having found that return was not  feasible  in  the  Appellant's  case
    relying on paragraph 170 of the case of  AA  (Article  15(c))  Iraq  CG
    [2015] UKUT 544, the judge dismissed the appeal on all grounds.

 4. Not content with that decision by Notice dated 18th October  2016  with
    grounds prepared by Mr Royston, application was made for permission  to
    appeal to the Upper Tribunal.  On 1st November 2016 Judge of the First-
    tier Tribunal Adio granted permission.

 5. Much is not in dispute before me.  Mr Diwnycz concedes that  the  judge
    failed to consider the risk to the Appellant by any inability to obtain
    a CSID within a reasonable time.  That is accepted by Mr Diwnycz to  be
    not only an error of law but a material one.  It is not  necessary  for
    me to go behind any concession and I do not do so.  That the  error  is
    material means that I have to consider whether to re-make the  decision
    or remit it.  In the circumstances of this  particular  case  with  the
    need for no further evidence to be called it was  entirely  appropriate
    that I should move on to re-make the decision.

 6. The agreed issue for me is this:

         "Given that the Appellant would not easily be able to obtain a CSID
         because he has no relevant documents which would enable him to  use
         the embassy in London, no family contacts and no support and  given
         that he is from a contested area  where  there  is  no  alternative
         Civil Affairs office in Baghdad, would it be unreasonable to expect
         the Appellant to relocate to Baghdad? (It is common ground that the
         Appellant is a refugee in his home area)."

 7. Relevant to my findings are paragraphs 179 and 187 of the  decision  of
    AA in the Upper Tribunal:

         "179. Dr Fattah in  his  most  recent  report  indicates  that  the
             starting position  is  that  in  order  to  obtain  a  new  or
             replacement CSID  a  person  usually  had  to  return  to  the
             governorate where his or her birth was  registered  and  where
             the primary family registration book is held i.e. in the local
             Population Registration/Civil Status office.  He  went  on  to
             explain that there are 300 Population Registration offices  in
             Iraq which are responsible to a central Civil  Status  Affairs
             Directorate."

 8. As I have already said the Appellant falls into a category  of  persons
    who would not be able to do that.

         "187.     An Iraqi national's ability to obtain CSID is  likely  to
             be severely hampered if they are unable to  go  to  the  Civil
             Status Affairs office of their home governorate because it  is
             in an area where Article 15(c) serious harm is occurring.   As
             a result of the violence, alternative CSA offices  for  Mosul,
             Anbar and Saluhaddin have  been  established  in  Baghdad  and
             Kerbala.  The evidence does not demonstrate that the  'central
             archive', which exists in Baghdad,  is  in  practice  able  to
             provide CSIDs to those in need of them.  There  is  however  a
             National Status Court in Baghdad,  to  which  a  person  could
             apply  for  formal  recognition  of  identity.   The   precise
             operation is, however, unclear."

 9. Notwithstanding the various  concessions  and  the  evidence  that  was
    accepted by the Judge, I was concerned by what appears at paragraph 170
    and which was referred to by Judge Pickup in  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    namely that the issue of a CSID only would be relevant where return  is
    feasible.

10. Mr Royston submitted that the guidance was  wrong  on  the  point.   Mr
    Diwnycz did not seek to  argue  against  that  but  the  common  ground
    appears to be (I have dictated this decision  before  the  parties  and
    there was no descent from this) that whereas in the case before  me  we
    are concerned with internal relocation rather than a  person  returning
    to their home area as a refugee then the question of reasonableness  is
    relevant and it is not reasonable to expect someone  to  return  to  an
    area which they cannot access.

11. Mr Diwnycz also helpfully at this stage of my dictation of the decision
    reminded me of that which is set out at paragraph 203 of AA which reads
    as follows:

         "On the evidence before us, whilst we accept that for a person  who
         has no family or other support in Baghdad and  who  also  does  not
         have a CSID, and cannot obtain one reasonably soon  after  arrival,
         it would be unreasonable and unduly harsh to relocate  to  Baghdad,
         for the generality of Iraqis,  despite  difficulties  that  may  be
         experienced  in  respect  of  such  matters  such  as   access   to
         healthcare, education and jobs,  we  consider  that  relocation  to
         Baghdad is safe and not unreasonable or unduly harsh -  one  reason
         being that a person could only  be  returned  to  Baghdad  if  such
         person has a current  or  expired  Iraqi  passport  or  a  laissez-
         passer".

12. Mr Diwnycz was right to take into paragraph 203 it clearly encapsulates
    the facts relevant to this particular case.  In the circumstances in re-
    making the decision I find that it would be unduly harsh to expect  the
    Appellant to return and relocate internally and in those  circumstances
    he is entitled to the status and relief sought.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained a material  error  of  law
and is set aside.  I re-make the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and
find that the Appellant is entitled to and does succeed  in  his  appeal  on
asylum grounds.  Necessarily the humanitarian  protection  appeal  does  not
fall to be considered.  Necessarily however the Appellant succeeds on  human
rights grounds (3 and 8).

No anonymity direction is made.
