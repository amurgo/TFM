Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr D O'Callaghan, Counsel, instructed by Hackney Law
Centre
For the Respondent:    Ms M Tanner, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS



 1. The appellant is a national of Ghana, who was born on 5 May  1984.   He
    entered this  country  on  5  July  2008  as  a  working  holidaymaker,
    permission having been granted for this purpose valid from 30 May  2008
    until 30 May 2010.  His visa had been granted in Cyprus,  to  where  he
    returned on 26 September 2008.  He then returned to the UK on  10  July
    2009, having obtained his degree in Cyprus.  His visits to the UK  have
    always been lawful and but for the circumstances set out below,  it  is
    not suggested that he would not have abided by all  the  conditions  of
    his visa.

 2. For the purposes of this appeal it is relevant  to  note  there  is  no
    suggestion that when he first entered this country, or when he returned
    from Cyprus, the appellant was aware that he was anything other than  a
    fit young man with no serious medical condition.

 3. While in this country,  lawfully,  in  or  about  September  2009,  the
    appellant was diagnosed with  end  stage  renal  failure.   It  is  not
    necessary for the purposes of this determination to set out the precise
    extent of his illness.  It is sufficient that I record that he was  and
    remains required to undergo regular dialysis, three times a  week,  and
    that should this treatment stop, he will die, probably within a week to
    ten days.

 4. There is no doubt whatsoever but that this appellant is very  seriously
    ill indeed; he is currently being kept alive because of  the  treatment
    he is continuing to receive under the NHS.

 5. On 3 June 2010, that is  very  shortly  after  his  visa  expired,  the
    appellant applied for leave to remain outside the Immigration Rules  on
    human rights grounds.

 6. This application was refused by the respondent on  26  September  2011.
    The refusal letter is dated the same date.

 7. The appellant appealed against this decision, and his appeal was  heard
    before Immigration Judge Braybrook, sitting at Taylor House on 22 March
    2012, but in a determination dated 6 April 2012 and promulgated  on  13
    April 2012, Judge Braybrook dismissed the appellant's appeal.

 8. The appellant appealed against this decision and was granted permission
    to appeal by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  McDade  on  2  May  2012.   In
    setting out the reasons for granting permission, Judge McDade stated as
    follows:

         "1.   The  appellant  has  applied  for  permission  to  appeal   a
             determination of Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal  Braybrook
             promulgated on 13th April 2012  in  which  she  dismissed  the
             appellant's appeal against the Secretary of State's refusal to
             grant him leave to remain in the United Kingdom under  Article
             3 of the ECHR.

         2.   The grounds of application for permission  to  appeal  assert,
             inter alia, that the judge has failed to take a proper account
             of the difficulty in accessing dialysis treatment in Ghana and
             the fact that were the appellant fail to do so he  would  face
             death within ten days.

         3.   The judge has properly cited the case  of  N  although  it  is
             arguable that too strict a construction has been placed on  it
             in the appellant's circumstances and that she has not properly
             considered   the   appellant's   difficulties   in   accessing
             treatment...".

 9. Standard directions were sent to the parties along with  the  grant  of
    permission and the appeal then came before me in September 2012.

10. On 20 September 2012, I considered this appeal on the papers and  found
    that Judge Braybrook's determination had contained a material error  of
    law, such that her decision must be set aside and re-made by the  Upper
    Tribunal.  I made this Decision on the papers for  reasons  which  were
    set out within my decision, in the following terms:

         "1.  No response having been received from the  respondent  to  the
             directions issued by Principal Resident Judge Southern,  which
             were  served  on  the  parties  together  with  the  grant  of
             permission to appeal, and in particular the respondent  having
             not made any submissions as to the need for an  oral  hearing,
             this Tribunal determines without a hearing, pursuant  to  Rule
             34 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008  that
             the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Braybrook
             contains a material error of law, such that her decision  must
             be set aside and remade by the Upper Tribunal.  My reasons for
             so finding are as follows.

         2.   The appellant was diagnosed with acute kidney failure in  2009
             while in this country lawfully.  The medical  evidence,  which
             was accepted by the First-tier Tribunal,  was  that  he  needs
             regular dialysis and that without it  he  will  die,  probably
             within about ten days.  It is also acknowledged that  dialysis
             is available in Ghana but at a very significant  cost  and  at
             very limited locations.  The cost is getting  on  for  �10,000
             per year, and it is said  in  the  grounds  that  dialysis  is
             available only in Accra and Kamasi.

         3.   Judge Braybrook's reasoning supporting her  finding  that  the
             appellant had  not  established  that  there  was  no  funding
             available to  pay  for  his  treatment  from  members  of  his
             extended family is in my judgment  inadequate,  in  particular
             where she appears  to  rely  on  the  appellant's  failure  to
             provide an "explanation why on an earlier occasion  his  uncle
             had been willing to help fund the appellant's holiday  in  the
             UK", because the costs of this holiday would clearly have been
             much less than the cost of the treatment he would require  for
             dialysis in Ghana.  There also appears to be no  consideration
             of whether logistically the appellant would actually  be  able
             to be placed on dialysis  within  ten  days  of  returning  to
             Ghana, even if the funds for  this  treatment  could  be  made
             available.

         4.   Even though the appellant does not appear to have argued  that
             his appeal should be allowed under Article 8, as distinct from
             under  Article  3,  I  consider  that  this  aspect   of   the
             Appellant's case should have been considered, particularly  in
             the absence of a sustainable finding as to whether or not  the
             Appellant would be able to access the treatment he would  need
             within the very limited timeframe available.  I consider  that
             Judge Braybrook's failure to consider the appeal under Article
             8 was also a material error of law.

         5.   When considering whether it was proportionate  for  Article  8
             purposes to remove this appellant now, in circumstances  where
             it had arguably not been established that his treatment  could
             be continued immediately on  return,  Judge  Braybrook  should
             also have  had  in  mind  (and  this  Tribunal  will  have  to
             consider) the decision of the Court of  Appeal  in  JA  (Ivory
             Coast) and ES (Tanzania) v SSHD [2009] EWCA Civ 1353.

         6.   The position  of  people  such  as  this  appellant  who  have
             suffered  renal  failure  while  in  this  country  has   been
             considered by this Tribunal in GS, which was remitted back  to
             this Tribunal by the Court of Appeal; it is  likely  that  the
             decision in this case will have been promulgated  before  this
             appeal is relisted."

11. I also directed that the appeal was  to  be  listed  before  me  for  a
    hearing on the merits and the parties were given permission  to  adduce
    further evidence with regard to whether or not the appellant  would  be
    likely to be able  to  commence  treatment  on  return  to  Ghana.   In
    particular, I gave permission to the respondent to adduce  evidence  of
    any steps she may have taken before the  hearing  to  ensure  that  the
    appellant would be able to access  treatment  which  was  available  in
    Ghana immediately on his return, and for  what  period  such  treatment
    would be expected to continue without any financial contribution  being
    provided by or on behalf  of  the  appellant.   I  directed  that  this
    evidence should be filed with the Tribunal  and  served  on  the  other
    party by no later than seven days before the hearing.

12. The respondent chose not to adduce evidence of steps  taken  to  ensure
    that the appellant would be able to access any treatment  available  in
    Ghana immediately on his return (she had taken no steps) and before the
    hearing, the Tribunal's decision in GS & EO (Article 3 - health  cases)
    India [2012] UKUT 00387 had been promulgated.

The Hearing

13. I heard evidence from the appellant, who was  cross-examined.   I  also
    heard submissions on behalf of both parties.  I recorded  the  evidence
    and submissions contemporaneously and  my  notes  of  the  hearing  are
    contained within my Record of Proceedings.  Accordingly,  I  shall  not
    set out verbatim everything which was said during  the  course  of  the
    hearing, but shall refer below only to such parts of the  evidence  and
    submissions as are necessary for the purposes of this determination.  I
    have, however, had regard to  everything  which  was  said  during  the
    course of the hearing as well as to all  of  the  very  many  documents
    contained within the file.

14. At the outset, Ms Tanner accepted that the respondent  had  written  to
    the appellant confirming that his application would be dealt with as an
    in-time application, and that this remained the case.   Accordingly  he
    should be treated as someone who has remained in this country  lawfully
    pursuant to section 3C of the Immigration Act 1971.   The  letter  from
    the respondent of 8 November 2010 confirmed that the application  would
    be treated as an in-time Article 8 application outside the  Rules.   Ms
    Tanner also stated that she only wished to ask the appellant  questions
    with regard to how much his father was  paying  for  the  education  at
    university and college of two of his siblings.  She would be submitting
    that whether or not the father would choose to pay for the  appellant's
    medical treatment in Ghana was a question of priorities.

15. The appellant relied on the witness statements which he  had  made  and
    gave further evidence as to his current  medical  condition.   For  the
    purpose of these proceedings I can summarise this as being that  he  is
    very seriously ill indeed and that he is dependent  at  the  moment  on
    assistance which is being provided by the Hackney Migrant Centre  which
    is a charity based in Hackney.  This charity  provides  him  with  food
    every week.  It also provides him with other assistance.

16. In cross-examination, the appellant was asked detailed questions  about
    his finances, in particular as to how  much  his  father  was  earning.
    Although the appellant was not able to provide  detailed  figures,  his
    best estimate was that his father would earn about 600 to 800 cedies  a
    month if his crops were doing well and the market  was  good,  but  his
    income would fluctuate.  (This would equate to between �200  and  under
    �300 per month).  Certainly, he did not have a lot of money coming  in.
    So far  as  his  sponsorship  was  concerned  when  he  was  a  working
    holidaymaker, his uncle had sponsored him for his air  fare  which  was
    about �600.  He had earned money while he was  being  educated,  during
    the vacation.

17. Ms Tanner did not seek to challenge in cross-examination the  assertion
    made by Mr O'Callaghan that the evidence showed that the tuition/living
    costs of the appellant's two siblings currently being educated amounted
    to around 4,000 cedies per year (2,000 each) (which was under �1,500 in
    total).

Submissions

18. At the outset, Ms Tanner made it clear that the  respondent's  position
    was that she did not intend to do anything to ensure that  transitional
    arrangements were in place  should  the  appellant  be  returned.   Her
    position was that even if this appellant could not afford dialysis, and
    the consequence would be that if returned he would die, that still  did
    not place any obligation on this country.  This country did not have  a
    moral responsibility with regard to this appellant.

19. It was clear from the decision in GS that an  appeal  under  Article  3
    could not succeed.  It was however accepted that in  GS,  at  paragraph
    85(8) at page 23, the Tribunal had considered Article 8 and had  found,
    at paragraph 85(8)(b) that "in principle Article 8 can be  relied  upon
    in  cases  of  this  sort".   This  was  because   removal   in   these
    circumstances would on  the  face  of  it  engage  Article  8(1).   The
    appellant's physical and moral  integrity  would  be  affected  as  per
    Bensaid v UK [2001] 33 EHRR 10.

20. However, the Tribunal in GS acknowledged that  Article  8  was  not  an
    absolute right, and the economic well-being of  the  country  would  be
    relevant when considering proportionality.  This was a weighty matter.

21. It was acknowledged that the Tribunal in GS, at paragraph 85(8)(c)  did
    consider that the type of leave which an applicant  had  was  relevant.
    In the cases considered there, the applicant had no leave,  whereas  in
    this case this appellant had 3C leave pending the outcome.   The  court
    in GS had stated that it would be very rare for an appellant to succeed
    under Article 8 if he had absolutely no right to be in the UK,  but  it
    was acknowledged that that was not the case here.

22. Although in the refusal letter, it was said that the appellant had  not
    established a private life in this country, this  was  not  now  relied
    upon.  For the purposes of  this  appeal,  it  was  accepted  that  the
    appellant did have a private life in this  country.   It  was  accepted
    that the fact that he was receiving life saving treatment without which
    he would be dead was part of his physical and moral integrity.

23. The issue for this Tribunal was how far Article 8 could be engaged when
    Article 3 was not breached.  In this case, although it was argued  that
    the appellant would be unable to afford the treatment and  it  was  not
    widely available, it was not suggested that he would  be  discriminated
    against with regard to the availability of treatment,  nor  would  such
    treatment  be  unavailable  because  of  internal  turmoil  within  the
    country.

24. In this case, the Tribunal had to consider, on the evidence  presented,
    to the balance of probabilities, whether it could be believed that  the
    appellant's father was in as poor a financial position as claimed.   On
    the evidence presented, it would seem  that  the  appellant's  father's
    income fluctuated.  The appellant could not say what it was but claimed
    it was around �300 per month.  The cost of the treatment  would  appear
    to be �1,600 per two months, plus living accommodation.

25. The Tribunal also had to consider the type of family support,  physical
    and emotional, which the appellant could expect  to  receive.   On  the
    evidence, both his father and uncle had supported him when he wanted to
    travel abroad and the family also continued to support his two siblings
    who were in further education.  This did  not  indicate  anything  more
    than the normal support provided to children.  This  support  would  be
    open to the appellant.

26. Ms Tanner submitted further that following GS, although it was relevant
    whether or not an applicant was in the UK lawfully, that was  just  one
    aspect of what had to be considered.  It would still be unusual  for  a
    case to succeed under Article 8 unless that  case  would  also  succeed
    under Article 3.  The Tribunal should not give undue  emphasis  to  the
    fact that the appellant was in this country lawfully.  Article 8 should
    not be used as a back-door to mop up  cases  which  could  not  succeed
    under Article 3.  The  respondent  would  also  re-emphasise  that  the
    public interest has to be of paramount importance in such cases.

27. For completeness, Ms Tanner wished the Tribunal to be reminded, without
    criticising the Tribunal, that Article 8 had not been raised before the
    First-tier Tribunal, or in the grounds.

28. In response to this last point, I reminded Ms Tanner that I had  raised
    Article 8  myself, having in mind the decision of the Court  of  Appeal
    in JA (Ivory Coast).

29. On behalf of the appellant, Mr O'Callaghan relied  on  the  submissions
    which are cogently made in his skeleton argument.  With regard to  this
    Tribunal's consideration of Article  8,  although  this  had  not  been
    argued in the First-tier Tribunal and was not argued  in  the  grounds,
    the Tribunal was entitled to look at the application and,  if  a  point
    was obvious, take it.  Further, it was open to the respondent  to  have
    challenged this by way of reply, but the respondent chose not to do so.
     The appellant's main arguments can be summarised as follows:

30. The appellant was in this  country  lawfully  when  he  became  unwell,
    having been here for over a year.  Because  his  application  is  being
    treated as having been made in-time, he  is  entitled  to  remain  here
    until his appeal has been determined, and accordingly he is entitled to
    receive  healthcare  treatment  in  this  country.   His  treatment  is
    accordingly lawful.  The  medical  evidence  was  clear.   He  required
    dialysis, three times per week, for four hours at a time,  and  without
    this treatment he would die within seven to ten days.

31. The Tribunal had to bear in mind that people on dialysis such  as  this
    appellant  were  subject  to  infection.   This  appellant   had   been
    hospitalised for two weeks recently and also  in  December  2011.   Two
    places had been  identified  in  Ghana  where  dialysis  treatment  was
    available, in Accra and Kumasi, but they were respectively four  and  a
    half hours and five  hours  from  where  his  parents  lived  and  this
    appellant could not be expected to travel to either one of  them  three
    times a week.  So looking at the cost of medical  care,  together  with
    accommodation and living expenses, the appellant  would  have  to  find
    about �13,000 per year.

32. On the basis of the evidence before the court, these funds were  simply
    not available.  Although the appellant's uncle had  agreed  to  sponsor
    the air flight of the appellant when he was a working holidaymaker, the
    sum required for this journey was far less than the sums required  now.



33. It was accepted on behalf of the appellant that in light of GS (India),
    the appellant could not succeed under Article 3.

34. The appellant relied on the decision of  the  Court  of  Appeal  in  JA
    (Ivory Coast), although this authority had not been referred to  in  GS
    (India).  It was the appellant's case that there was an  assumption  of
    responsibility in this  case.   The  appellant  was  lawfully  in  this
    country and receiving medical help.  The responsibility remained  until
    this country was able to return him in circumstances where he would not
    die within about ten days.  The point  was  not  whether  or  not  this
    country  should  assume   responsibility   forever,   but   when   such
    responsibility would be ended.  In suicide  cases,  it  was  recognised
    that a person at risk of suicide  could  not  be  returned  until  this
    country had ensured that he or she  would  have  appropriate  care  and
    support on return.  That is when responsibility would come to  an  end.
    The  appellant  did  not  seek  to  argue  that  this  country  had   a
    responsibility forever, but it did not end the moment  of  return.   An
    appropriate period of care should be ensured.

35. In answer to a question from the Tribunal as to what it  was  suggested
    such an appropriate period would be, Mr O'Callaghan replied that  every
    case was fact-specific.  However, in this case, the respondent had said
    she would not take any steps.  In  suicide  cases,  arrangements  would
    normally be made to ensure that someone would meet the returnee at  the
    airport and/or that that person was placed into hospital on return.  In
    this case, the appellant's position was that he should not be  returned
    unless and until arrangements had been made to ensure that he would not
    die, painfully, almost immediately.

36. In terms  of  proportionality,  Mr  O'Callaghan  relied  on  the  Huang
    approach.  There had to be a fair balance between, on the one hand  the
    public interest but on the other hand the  deleterious  effect  upon  a
    person of having to leave the country  in  circumstances  such  as  the
    present.  As per Sedley LJ, in particular at paragraphs 16 and 17 of JA
    (Ivory Coast), the appellant  was  not  required  to  show  exceptional
    circumstances "as compelling" as those in D.  The  fact  that  in  this
    case this appellant was in this country lawfully was important.  It was
    a weighty factor.

Discussion

37. I am grateful to both Ms Tanner and Mr O'Callaghan for the careful  and
    balanced way in which their submissions were  presented.   I  make  the
    following findings of fact.

38. The appellant should be treated as a  person  whose  presence  in  this
    country has always been lawful.  At the time when he was diagnosed with
    renal failure, he was in this country lawfully, and  he  had  not  been
    aware before he came here that his health would deteriorate in the  way
    in which it did.  This is not what might sometimes be  described  as  a
    case of "health tourism".

39. The appellant is only alive today because of the care which he has been
    receiving, lawfully, under the NHS.  He is also dependent on assistance
    which is given to him by the Hackney Migrant Centre, a charity based in
    Hackney, both in the form of food but also in the form  of  advice  and
    other assistance.

40. The appellant is very seriously ill indeed.   Unless  he  continues  to
    receive regular dialysis treatment he will die, probably  within  seven
    to ten days of this treatment being discontinued.  If  he  were  to  be
    removed, he would need to  receive  treatment  immediately  before  his
    flight, but in any  event,  his  situation  on  return  would  be  very
    dangerous indeed.  There are only two places in Ghana where dialysis is
    currently available, one in Accra and the other in Kumasi.  The cost of
    this treatment is around �10,000 per year.  Also, because the appellant
    could not travel from his parents' home to either of these places three
    times a week (the journey time is far too long) he would need  to  find
    about another �3,000 per year for accommodation and  subsistence.   The
    subsistence would in those  circumstances  be  fairly  basic,  and  the
    appellant would be on his own.

41. Although the evidence relating to what income is currently available to
    the appellant's family is not entirely clear, I  am  satisfied  on  the
    balance of probabilities that the income available to  the  appellant's
    family is substantially below the sums which would be required  to  pay
    for his ongoing treatment.  I also take into account that  despite  the
    indication from this Tribunal, in the directions which I gave, that the
    Tribunal would take into consideration  any  transitional  arrangements
    which might have been made, the  respondent  has  made  no  attempt  to
    secure at the very least that there would be  continuity  of  treatment
    for at least a limited period following the appellant's return.

42. In these circumstances, I conclude, on the  balance  of  probabilities,
    that it is more likely than not that if  returned  now  this  appellant
    would die within seven to ten days.

43. As accepted on behalf of the appellant, following the decision  of  the
    Presidential Tribunal in GS (India), which I regard as binding  on  me,
    the appellant's appeal cannot succeed under Article  3.   Treatment  is
    available in Ghana, and it is clear from cases  such  as  N,  that  the
    inability to pay for such  treatment  does  not  found  a  claim  under
    Article 3.  However, as was made plain by the Court  of  Appeal  in  JA
    (Ivory Coast), that does  not  necessarily  preclude  an  appeal  under
    Article 8 succeeding.  I have in mind in particular the observations of
    Sedley LJ at paragraphs 16 and 17 of JA (Ivory Coast), as follows:
         "16. This court has more than once stressed the need for structured
             decisions on proportionality. One of the elements  of  such  a
             structure capable of having a bearing  here  is  the  need  to
             relate the proportionality of  an  interference  with  private
             life to the purpose for which it is said to be necessary. Here
             the  prescribed  purposes  are,  or  include,   the   economic
             wellbeing of the  country,  which  cannot  afford  to  be  the
             world's hospital, and the prior right of a settled  population
             to the benefit of  its  inevitably  finite  health  resources.
             Against these may legitimately be weighed both the moral  duty
             to help others in need and the fact that  the  United  Kingdom
             has until  recently  found  it  both  morally  compelling  and
             economically possible to extend such help  to  the  appellants
             and others like them,  alongside  and  not  evidently  to  the
             detriment of the settled population.
          1. There is no fixed relationship between Article 3  and  Article
             8. Typically a finding of a violation of the former may make a
             decision on the latter unnecessary;  but  the  latter  is  not
             simply a more easily accessed version of the former. Each  has
             to be  approached  and  applied  on  its  own  terms,  and  Ms
             Giovannetti is accordingly right not to suggest that  a  claim
             of the present kind must come within Article  3  or  fail.  In
             this respect, as in others, these claims are in  Mr  Knafler's
             submission distinct from cases such as D and  N,  in  both  of
             which the appellant's presence and treatment in  the  UK  were
             owed entirely to an unlawful entry."

44. Then, at paragraph 21, the court in JA (Ivory  Coast)  emphasised  that
    "the alien subject to expulsion in both D and N were foreign  nationals
    who had never been lawfully admitted to the United Kingdom", which  was
    contrasted (at paragraph 22) with "the present appellants" who "are  in
    a significantly different legal position from D and N".  The court then
    continued (at paragraph 22) as follows:

         "This in turn, as Ms Giovannetti contingently concedes, gives  them
         a toehold on Article 8"... [While there should not be]  exaggerated
         importance   [given   for]   the   notion    of    assumption    of
         responsibility... [nonetheless] the question is whether  in  either
         case the true toehold  is  sufficient  to  enable  them  to  resist
         removal. This must depend in large part on  the  remainder  of  the
         material facts...".

45. It is important to note that the Presidential Tribunal  in  GS  (India)
    was specifically not invited to consider the applicants' appeals before
    them under Article 8.  This was stated by  the  Tribunal  at  paragraph
    85(8)(a) where the Tribunal also stated that "in  those  circumstances,
    we do not express any conclusions on the issue [regarding Article 8]".

46. However, the Tribunal in GS (India) then went on to find as follows, at
    paragraph 85(8)(b):

         "However, in principle Article 8 can be relied on in cases of  this
         sort.  The removal of the individual would,  on  the  fact  of  it,
         engage Article 8(1) on the basis of an interference with his or her
         private life as an aspect of that individual's physical  and  moral
         integrity" (see Bensaid v UK [2001] 33 EHRR 10)...".

    At paragraph 85(8)(c) the Tribunal then stated as follows:

         "It may be that although, in principle, the scope of Article  8  is
         wider than that of Article 3, in practical terms... in a case  like
         this where the claimant has no right to  remain  [my  emphasis]  it
         will be a  'very  rare  case'  indeed  where  such  a  claim  could
         succeed... that reality may lie at the heart of the majority's view
         of the Strasbourg Court  in  N  v  UK  when,  having  rejected  the
         individual's claim under Article 3, stated that no "separate issue"
         arose under Article 8...".

    Then, at paragraph 85(8)(d), referring to the minority in N  v  UK  who
    had "disagreed with the failure to address  Article  8",  the  Tribunal
    found as follows:

         "We see some force in this.  If it be the case that the  Article  3
         threshold is an exceptionally high  one  because  of  the  absolute
         character of the prohibition and concerns that  Contracting  States
         could be swamped by health tourism claims by people with  no  prior
         connection to the state in question seeking to enter or  remain  to
         gain  access  to  expensive  medical  treatment,   an   Article   8
         proportionality analysis might yield a different outcome  in  other
         cases, possibly where the  claimant  had  a  lawful  permission  to
         reside in the host state before the disease was diagnosed".

47. No doubt because the Tribunal in GS (India) had  not  been  invited  to
    consider the application under Article 8, there is no reference in that
    decision to JA (Ivory Coast).

48. It is clear, in my judgment, that this is a  case  where  at  the  very
    least this appellant has a "toehold" on Article 8 (as per Sedley LJ  in
    JA (Ivory Coast)).  His case is, as was the case of the  appellants  in
    JA (Ivory Coast) clearly distinct from cases such as D and N, where the
    applicants were not in this country  lawfully  and,  in  the  words  of
    Sedley LJ at paragraph 17, their "presence and treatment in the UK were
    owed entirely to an unlawful entry".  While it is of course  absolutely
    right that a factor which must be given great weight  is  the  economic
    wellbeing of the  country  "which  cannot  afford  to  be  the  world's
    hospital" (again as per Sedley LJ at paragraph 16 of JA (Ivory Coast)),
    in a case such as the present, this factor should be given less  weight
    than it would in a case either of premeditated entry for the purpose of
    obtaining  healthcare  which  would  be  unavailable  otherwise  in  an
    applicant's home country or a case where that applicant had never  been
    entitled to be in this country in the first place.

49. This is, in my judgment, just the sort of case where, in the  words  of
    Upper Tribunal Judge Grubb, giving the decision of the Tribunal  in  GS
    (India) at paragraph 85(8)(d), "an Article 8  proportionality  analysis
    might yield a different outcome in  other  cases,  possibly  where  the
    claimant had a lawful permission to reside in the host state before the
    disease was diagnosed".

50. In terms of the exercise this Tribunal is  required  to  carry  out  in
    light of the guidance given by Lord  Bingham  in  Razgar,  I  find,  as
    accepted on behalf of the respondent, that this appellant does  have  a
    private life in this country, and that his  removal  would  engage  his
    Article 8 rights, because  it  would  affect  his  physical  and  moral
    integrity.  The removal would be lawful, and would be necessary in  the
    sense that it would be required  for  the  economic  wellbeing  of  the
    country.  However, as it so often is, the real question is whether that
    removal would be proportionate.

51. In light of all the factors set out above, I do not consider  that  the
    removal of this appellant now would be proportionate. I make  it  clear
    that I am not in this determination seeking to set out  precisely  what
    steps the respondent ought  to  have  taken  in  this  case  to  ensure
    continuity of care, or for how long such continuity of care should have
    been arranged.  Nor am I suggesting that this appellant is entitled  to
    be treated at the expense of the NHS forever.  I am also not suggesting
    that the respondent must always ensure continuity of care, particularly
    in circumstances where either an applicant has  come  to  this  country
    with a pre-existing condition of which he or she was  aware,  with  the
    implicit purpose of receiving treatment  for  that  condition  in  this
    country, or where an applicant had  no  lawful  right  to  be  in  this
    country.   However,  the  circumstances  in  this  case  are   entirely
    different, and I give great weight to what Sedley LJ at paragraph 16 of
    JA (Ivory Coast) considered to be "the moral duty  to  help  others  in
    need" (albeit that this must  obviously  be  considered  against  other
    factors justifying removal in any given case).

52. The stark facts in this particular case are, on my  findings,  that  if
    returned now, in circumstances where no arrangements have been made for
    this  appellant  to  receive  continuing  care,  on  the   balance   of
    probabilities he would be  dead  within  ten  days.   As  the  cost  of
    providing  continuity  of  care  for  at  least  a  limited  period  is
    relatively low, I do not consider that the economic wellbeing  of  this
    country is so threatened by this appellant's continued presence (or  by
    the cost of ensuring continuity of care for a limited period  following
    return) that this country now can properly just turn its  back  on  him
    and cut off his only means of survival.  However severe this  country's
    economic difficulties might be, they are not so severe  as  to  justify
    this appellant's removal now without ensuring at the  very  least  that
    his care will be continued on return for a period which would allow him
    a chance of securing further financial backing to enable his  treatment
    to continue.  In other words, his removal now, in these  circumstances,
    would not be proportionate.

53. It follows that this appellant's appeal must succeed,  and  I  will  so
    order.

Decision

I  set  aside  the  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Braybrook  as
containing a material error of law, and substitute the following decision:

The appellant's appeal is allowed, on human rights grounds, Article 8.
