                                   Before

                      DEPUTY UPPER TRIBUNAL JUDGE JUSS

                                   Between

                        mrs Najmeh Shokripoormasooleh
                                                                   Appellant

                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     No attendance
For the Respondent:    Mr Neville Smart (HOPO)


                CONSENT TO WITHDRAWAL OF THE APPELLANT'S CASE
  (Pursuant to Rule 17(2) of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules
                                    2008)


 1. The Appellant sought permission to appeal against the decision of Judge
    Gillespie promulgated on 7th November 2013, following a hearing on  6th
    November 2013, whereby the judge upheld the decision of the  Respondent
    Secretary of State, against the appeal of the  Appellant,  against  the
    refusal of entry clearance as the spouse of  Mr  Hussein  Zahadi  under
    Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.  Following the Appellant's appeal
    against that decision, on 12th  May  2014,  permission  to  appeal  was
    granted.

 2. However, at the hearing before me  on  4th  July  2014,  there  was  no
    attendance by the Appellant or of anybody on her behalf.  The clerk  of
    the Tribunal informed me that there had been a written request that the
    Appellant wished to withdraw  the  appeal  to  the  original  decision.
    Pursuant to the  Upper  Tribunal  (Rule  17(2))  Rules,  I accordingly
    consented to the withdrawal by the Appellant with the consequence  that
    the original decision of the Immigration Judge now stands.
