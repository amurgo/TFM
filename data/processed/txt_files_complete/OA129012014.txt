                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. For ease of reference, I will refer to the parties as they were  before
    the First-tier Tribunal. Thus,  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  is  the
    Respondent and Mr Qureshi is the Appellant.

 2. This is an appeal by the Respondent against the decision of  First-tier
    Tribunal  Judge  Morgan  (hereafter,  the  judge)   who   allowed   the
    Appellant's appeal under Article 8 outside  of  the  Immigration  Rules
    (the Rules).  That appeal was in  turn  against  the  decision  of  the
    Respondent, dated  26  August  2014,  refusing  entry  clearance  under
    Appendix FM to the  Rules,  with  reference  to  Appendix  FM-SE.   The
    refusal was based solely on the ground that  the  Appellant  could  not
    satisfy the financial requirements of the Rules.

The hearing before the judge.

 3. The judge found the Appellant's wife's evidence to be  wholly  credible
    (see paragraph 6).  He went on to find that because of their particular
    financial circumstances as at the date of application,  and  presumably
    date of decision, the Appellant was unable to satisfy the  requirements
    of the Rules in respect of finances (see paragraph 10).

 4. The judge then considered the case on Article 8 grounds outside of  the
    Rules.  In paragraph 12 he stated that the Appellant had  been  refused
    visit visas on three occasions with no right of appeal.   At  paragraph
    22 the judge cited the case of Mostafa  [2015]  UKUT  00112  (IAC)  and
    found that as at the date of hearing the Appellant was able to  satisfy
    the financial requirements of the Rules. This, it was said, was capable
    of being a weighty factor in the Appellant's favour.  At  paragraph  23
    the judge made reference to the fact that there were children  involved
    in this case including one recently born to  the  Appellant's  wife  in
    this country.  The judge found that the refusal of leave to  enter  was
    disproportionate.  At paragraph 24 the judge made reference to part  5A
    of the 2002 Act as amended.  He stated that the Appellant "is  able  to
    satisfy the requirements of entry clearance and this was  foreseeable".
    The judge went on to state that the Appellant would not be a burden  on
    the taxpayer and this weighed in his favour.  Finally the judge  stated
    that "the weight to be attached to  effective  immigration  control  is
    significantly reduced by  the  (Appellant's)  ability  to  satisfy  the
    income requirements of the  Immigration  Rules  for  those  seeking  to
    remain in the United Kingdom on the basis of marriage".

 5. The Respondent sought permission to appeal  on  the  basis  of  alleged
    misdirections in law, relating in particular to the  cases  of  Mostafa
    and AM (Malawi) [2015] UKUT  0260  (IAC).   Permission  to  appeal  was
    granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Landes  in  a  detailed  decision
    dated 25 September 2015.

The hearing before me

 6. At the hearing before me the Appellant was represented by his wife, Mrs
    Qureshi (the sponsor).  I took time to explain the proceedings  to  her
    and ensured that she understood what was being  said  at  all  material
    times.

 7. Mr Avery submitted that there were no real factual disputes in  respect
    of  the  judge's  findings  on  particular  issues.   However,  he  had
    misdirected himself in material ways as to the relevant law as set  out
    in the grounds  of  appeal.  These  errors  were  material.   Mr  Avery
    submitted that a fresh application could have been made and that it was
    possible that such an  application  might  succeed  in  light  of  what
    appeared to be the Appellant's improved financial position.  In respect
    of the best interests of children these are of course relevant but  the
    fact that a fresh application could readily be made and the failure  to
    have met the Rules in this case  rendered  the  decision  under  appeal
    proportionate.

 8. The sponsor made certain observations  to  me.   She  appreciated  that
    perhaps they  had  made  some  mistakes  in  respect  of  the  original
    application regarding their financial position, but  these  proceedings
    had taken a long time to be resolved.  She  currently  has  savings  of
    �103,648 held in accounts in the United Kingdom in her name and that of
    her husband.  She remained working as  a  carer  earning  approximately
    �21,500 per annum gross.  She  also  received  rental  income  from  an
    investment property.  She did not believe that she could  have  made  a
    fresh application before now because of the need to resolve the current
    case.

Error of law decision

 9. I find that the judge did make  material  errors  of  law.   First,  at
    paragraph 22 he misdirected himself  as  to  the  case  of  Mostafa  by
    finding that the Appellant's ability to satisfy the Rules  has  at  the
    date of hearing was capable of being a weighty factor, in  his  favour.
    That is incorrect: in entry clearance cases, the relevant date is  that
    of the decision under appeal.

10. Second, this error is effectively  repeated  in  paragraph  24  of  the
    decision.

11. Third, the judge has failed to take  account  of  the  decision  in  AM
    (Malawi) when considering the effect of the Appellant's ability  to  be
    maintained: this is not a factor which would weigh in  his  favour  but
    rather one that would not count against him.

12. Finally, when seen in the context of the previous error on what was the
    relevant date, the judge was also wrong  to  have  concluded  that  the
    weight to  be  attached  to  effective  immigration  control  could  be
    significantly reduced by the Appellant's ability to satisfy the  income
    requirements of the Rules.

13. These errors were material to the outcome of the appeal because if  the
    errors had not been made  they  could  have  affected  the  outcome  in
    respect of Article 8 outside of the Rules.  In light of the above I set
    aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

Remaking the decision

14. There was no suggestion that I should do  otherwise  than  re-make  the
    decision myself on the basis of the evidence before me. This I  proceed
    to do.

15.  I make it very clear that the only issue in this case  throughout  has
    been the ability to meet the financial requirements of the Rules as  at
    the date of decision.  More particularly, it was the ability to satisfy
    the evidential requirement within  Appendix  FM-SE.  I  find  that  all
    requirements under Appendix FM, save for  that  relating  to  financial
    requirements were as at the  date  of  decision  and  continue  to  be,
    satisfied by the Appellant.

16.  However,  I  find,  as  did  the  judge  below,  that  the   financial
    requirements were not met as at the date of decision, with reference to
    the evidential requirements of Appendix FM-SE.  That is no criticism of
    the Appellant or his wife.  They  had  taken  a  particular  course  of
    action in respect of their financial arrangements,  perhaps  not  quite
    knowing the relatively complex and particular requirements of  Appendix
    FM-SE.  Nonetheless it is a  fact  that  a  material  and  a  mandatory
    element of the Rules has not been met.  Therefore the appeal must  fail
    under the Rules.

17. Given that there are, and  were  children  involved  in  this  case,  I
    consider the At 8 claim outside of the Rules.  It was  and  is  in  the
    children's best interests to be living with both of their parents, that
    their best interests  is  a  primary  consideration  for  me.  I  place
    significant weight upon those best interests.  However they are not  of
    course a 'trump card'.  I take into account the important fact that the
    requirements of the Rules are not met.  I take  into  account  that  in
    respect of the previous refusals of visit visas  there  would  in  fact
    have been a right of appeal attached to those refusals, albeit on human
    rights grounds only, and that  again,  not  wishing  to  criticise  the
    Appellant, he could have exercised that right of appeal in  respect  of
    seeking entry clearance to visit his wife  and  his  children  in  this
    country prior to making the application for settlement.

18. I take into account the fairly lengthy period  that  it  has  taken  to
    resolve the application. This was as a result of the  Appellant's  case
    being stacked up waiting for the decision of the Court of Appeal in  MM
    (Lebanon) [2014] EWCA Civ 585.  This was an unfortunate delay, but  not
    one that in my view represents a compelling circumstance in this  case.



19. Importantly, as Mr Avery has pointed out, it has always  been  open  to
    the Appellant and sponsor to make a fresh application.  Given that  the
    only area of dispute has been that of the financial  requirements,  and
    given what I accept are the improved financial situation of the couple,
    there are as far as I can see no obstacles to a fresh application being
    made, both  once  the  original  refusal  was  made  and  at  any  time
    thereafter.  This avenue is significant in that it gives effect to  the
    important public interest in maintaining effective immigration  control
    through operation of the Rules:  those  seeking  entry  to  the  United
    Kingdom ought to established that they can  meet  the  requirements  of
    those Rules unless there are compelling or  exceptional  circumstances.
    There are no such circumstances in this case.

20. With reference to the circumstances as at  the  date  of  decision  and
    bearing in mind as I do the best interests of the children, I  conclude
    that  the  Respondent's  refusal  of  entry   clearance   was   not   a
    disproportionate interference with the Respondent's  family  life.   In
    this case, the combined weighty factors of  the  failure  to  meet  the
    Rules, the importance of  effective  immigration  control  through  the
    Rules, and the ability of the Appellant to make a new application,  all
    go to outweigh the best interests of the two children.

21. I add this. On the documentary evidence provided at the hearing, I find
    as a fact that as of 6 January 2016 the Appellant  and  his  wife  have
    savings of �103,648 held within United Kingdom institutions.  I  accept
    that the Respondent's wife was and continues to be a carer with a gross
    annual income of about �21,500.  I also find that she  receives  rental
    income.  In my view it  is  likely  (I  put  it  no  higher)  that  the
    financial requirements of Appendix FM (with reference to  Appendix  FM-
    SE) could now  be  met.  However,  there  would  have  to  be  a  fresh
    application by the Appellant, something that I mentioned to her at  the
    hearing.   This  is  an  avenue  that  she  needs   to   give   careful
    consideration to.

Notice of Decision

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.

I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

I re-make the decision by dismissing the appeal under the Immigration  Rules
and on human rights grounds.

No anonymity direction is made.
