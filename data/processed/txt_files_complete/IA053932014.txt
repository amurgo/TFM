                           MISS SINTHU SIVAGUMARAN


                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms S Ong, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr P Saini of Messrs Berkleys Solicitors

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The Secretary of State appeals, with permission, against a decision  of
    Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Handley  who  in  a  determination
    promulgated on  31  March  2014  allowed  the  appeal  of  Miss  Sinthu
    Sivagumaran against a decision of the Secretary of State to refuse  her
    leave to remain as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant.

2.   Although the Secretary of State is the appellant in the  appeal  before
    me I will for ease of reference refer to her as the respondent  as  she
    was the respondent in the First-tier Tribunal.  Similarly I will  refer
    to Miss Sinthu Sivagumaran as the appellant as she was the appellant in
    the First-tier Tribunal.

3.   The appellant applied on 10 October 2013 for leave to remain as a  Tier
    1 (Entrepreneur).

4.   In the application form she stated that she was relying on  money  from
    a venture capital firm, Equinox Venture  Capital  and  she  produced  a
    letter from Morgan  Reach  Certified  Chartered  Accountants  which  it
    appears stated that  she  had  access  to  the  sum  of  �50,000.   She
    confirmed that she had studied at Birmingham City University  receiving
    a BA Degree in International  Business.   To  show  that  she  had  the
    necessary sums for maintenance she produced bank statements starting on
    24 June when the account was opened with a nil balance but  into  which
    on 1 July had been paid �624.40 and on 2 July a further  sum  had  been
    paid bringing up the amount in the account to �1,016.19.  The following
    bank account statement showed steady balances of over �1,000 as  did  a
    bank statement issued on 23 September 2013 - that bank statement  being
    the last bank statement prior to the date of application.

5.   On 15 January 2014  her  application  was  refused.   She  was  granted
    points for access  to  funds,  funds  held  in  a  regulated  financial
    institution and funds disposable in the United Kingdom as well  as  for
    her knowledge of the English language.  However she received no  points
    for maintenance.

6.   The letter of refusal stated that:-

         "You have claimed 10 points for maintenance (funds) under 245DD(d)
         and Appendix C of the Immigration Rules but the Secretary of  State
         is not satisfied that the documents you have provided  demonstrated
         that you have been  in  possession  of  sufficient  funds  for  the
         specified period as laid out  in  Appendix  C  of  the  Immigration
         Rules."

7.   The reason for the decision was:-

         "You provided Barclays Bank statement's (sic) to  demonstrate  that
         you have been in possession of at least �900 of available funds for
         a consecutive 90 day period ending no more than 31 days before  the
         date of your application.


         We have assessed the maintenance requirement  from  the  period  26
         June 2013 to 23 September 2013.  From  the  evidence  provided  you
         have not demonstrated that you have maintained the minimum level of
         available funds required throughout this full  90  day  period,  as
         specified under Appendix C of the Immigration Rules.  It is because
         from 26 June 2013 to 23 September 2013 the level of funds available
         fell below �900 e.g. on 26 June your statement shows a  balance  of
         �0, further on 1 July 2013 your statement shows you had  a  balance
         of �616.90.


         We have therefore been unable to award points for maintenance."

8.   The appellant's grounds of appeal stated that

         "... the balance checked for 1 July does not apply, because  though
         the statement is from 1 July 2013 the balance was held from 2  July
         2013 to 12 October 2013 (the application date) and constitutes more
         than the required 90 days."

9.   Before Judge Handley (who considered the  appeal  on  the  papers)  the
    appellant provided a further  bank  statement  dated  23  October  2013
    showing a start balance on 24 September of �1,310 but showing a balance
    on 14 October of �912.  A  document  entitled  "  grounds  of  appeal",
    submitted just before the  appeal was  determined,   alleged  that  the
    respondent had erroneously calculated the maintenance from 23  June  to
    23 September 2013 and asserted that the  appellant had  made  available
    two bank statements as evidence of maintenance and  accidently  omitted
    one and that that fact was corroborated  and could  be  ascertained  by
    referring to the application form submitted  where  the  appellant  had
    clearly ticked confirmed that she had maintenance funds for a period of
    90 days.  It was therefore implied from her actions that the  appellant
    had access to the relevant funds for the relevant period of 2  July  to
    12 October and that the Secretary of State should have ascertained from
    the appellant that she had enough money up to 12 October  -   the  date
    of application.  It was for  the  respondent  to  scrutinise  the  bank
    statements in order to ascertain whether a bank statement from a series
    or sequence was missing.  It was stated that the Secretary of State had
    been under an obligation under the  evidential  flexibility  policy  to
    ascertain from the appellant whether a bank statement from a series was
    missing and that it was unfair that that had not  been  done.   It  was
    argued that the Secretary of State should have afforded  the  appellant
    an opportunity to provide a missing bank statement from a series.

10.  The grounds went on to refer  to  the  terms  of  paragraph  245AA  and
    various reports relating to the "flexibility policy"  as  well  as  the
    determination of the Tribunal in Rodriguez (Flexibility Policy)  [2013]
    UKUT 00042 (IAC).

11.  Reference was also made to the appellant's subsisting private  life  in
    Britain.

12.  Judge Handley considered the  submissions  made  and  stated  that  the
    appellant had presented bank  statements  with  the  notice  of  appeal
    covering the period from 26 June to 23 October 2013.   He  noticed  the
    balance on 2 July of �1,016 and that the account remained in excess  of
    �900 until  14  October.   He  concluded  that  this  showed  that  the
    appellant had the requisite funds available to her during the  relevant
    period.  He stated that he accepted  that  the  appellant  had  made  a
    "minor error" in not sending the final page of the bank  statement  and
    that had she done so her application would not have  been  refused  for
    the reasons given in the refusal letter.  He said  that  the  appellant
    was aware of the requirement to have �900 available for a 90 day period
    and had indicated so in her application form.  It was also  clear  that
    she had those funds  available  to  her  for  that  period.   He  found
    moreover that she should have been afforded an opportunity of producing
    the missing document.  He  therefore  found  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules had been met.

13.  The Secretary of State appealed arguing  that  the  judge  should  have
    considered the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Rodriguez [2014] EWCA
    Civ  2  regarding  the  Secretary  of  State's  obligations  under  the
    evidential flexibility policy.  The grounds  referred  to the fact that
    the Court of Appeal had made it clear that


         "Requests for information should not be speculative and that  there
         must be sufficient reasons to believe that any  evidence  requested
         existed.  Furthermore the evidential policy  was  not  designed  to
         give an applicant the opportunity first to  remedy  any  defect  or
         inadequacy in the application or supporting documentation so as  to
         save the application refusal after substantive consideration."

    It was therefore stated that the Secretary of State had been  under  no
    obligation to request further documents from the appellant.

14.  At the hearing of the appeal before me it was agreed  that  a  relevant
    issue was the meaning of the term "series".

15.  Ms Ong submitted that a series was a number of  documents  starting  at
    the beginning and ending with the  final  document  provided.   As  the
    appellant had produced documents in a series - the bank statements came
    one after the other then that was the series which  had  been  provided
    and from which none were missing.  There was therefore  no  requirement
    on the Secretary of State to ask for a further document.

16.  In reply Mr Saini stated that  a  series  was  effectively  a  line  of
    documents and that if one were missing whether it be within the  middle
    of a number of documents or at the beginning or at the  end  then  that
    should be requested under the provisions of paragraph 245AA.  There did
    not have to be a particular beginning or end of the series that related
    to the subject matter.

17.  Moreover that document should, under the provisions of paragraph  245AA
    be requested if there was an  insufficiency  in  the  application.   He
    pointed out that the application had not been refused until 15  January
    2014 and that there had therefore been ample time for the Secretary  of
    State to have asked for the missing document and moreover there  was  a
    duty of public law fairness to allow an opportunity for the document to
    be produced.  He pointed out that under the provisions of Section 3C(5)
    of the 1971 Immigration Act it was possible to vary an  application  up
    to the point of decision and that the whole purpose of paragraph  245AA
    was because the Secretary of State considered that it was only fair  to
    alert an applicant to a deficiency in the application and in  so  doing
    the Secretary of State was exercising the public law duty of  fairness.



18.  It was obvious from the application form that the appellant had  missed
    out one document and therefore it was appropriate to request the  final
    document in the series.

19.  He argued that the  reference  to  the  Court  of  Appeal  judgment  in
    Rodriguez was effectively irrelevant as this was a case relating to the
    provisions of Rule 245AA.  It was a question of the Rules  rather  than
    policy.  He pointed out in fact that  Judge  Handley  had  not  himself
    referred to the determination of the Tribunal in Rodriguez.  He  argued
    moreover that the grounds of challenge were merely a disagreement  with
    conclusions which the judge was  entitled  to  reach  on  the  evidence
    before him.

Discussion
20.  I have considered the terms of  paragraph  245AA  of  the  Rules.   The
    relevant sub-paragraph is (b) which reads as follows:-

         "If the applicant has submitted specified documents in which:


         (i)  some of the documents in a sequence  have  been  omitted  (for
             example, if one bank statement from  a  series  is  missing);"



     then that should be requested from the applicant.

21.  I have considered various definitions of a series; the term  implies  a
    sequence  or a run  or a succession  of documents.  I have come to  the
    conclusion that I do not accept Ms Ong's submission that  a  series  of
    documents must be one where the documents at the beginning and the  end
    of the series must be provided and it must  be  one  of  the  documents
    between those which is missing.  I  see  no  reason  why  a  series  of
    documents from which one is missing cannot be  a  document  before  the
    first which has been produced or that after the  last  which  has  been
    produced.  However  the  difficulty  is  that  the  documents  for  the
    relevant 90 day period must be documents which lead up to the  date  of
    application and therefore documents which are available at the date  of
    application but, in error, have not been submitted.

22.  In this case the reality is that no such document exists.  Although  it
    appears from the bank statements that in the 90 day period prior to the
    application the applicant had over �900 in  her  account  there  is  no
    document  in  existence,  that  was  available  to  submit   with   the
    application that showed that.  Therefore even  if  the  respondent  had
    asked for that document it did not exist.  The Rules  require  evidence
    to be submitted with the application that the requirements of the Rules
    are met.  That piece of documentary evidence was not available  at  the
    date of application and I do not consider that a statement  dated  well
    after the application can be taken into account.

23.  The judge allowed the appeal on the basis that he considered  that  the
    necessary funds were available for the 90 day  period.   However  those
    funds had to be evidenced by  documentary  evidence  and  there  is  no
    documentary evidence which was available at the  date  of  application,
    the  relevant  date,  which  would  have  shown  that  the  maintenance
    requirements of the Rules were met.

24.  I consider that the judge made a material error of law in not  focusing
    on  the  documentary  evidence  that  was  available  at  the  date  of
    application rather than on the funds which were available.

25.  I therefore set aside the decision of the Immigration Judge.

26.  In re-making the decision,  for  the  same  reasons  I  find  that  the
    appellant did not produce  and  indeed  has  not  produced  documentary
    evidence, available at the date of application which  showed  that  the
    appellant met the financial requirements of  the  Rules.   I  note,  of
    course, that Mr Saini argued that the appellant would  be  entitled  to
    vary her application after the date of application and before the  date
    of decision.   However  the  application  was  not  so  varied  by  the
    appellant and  there  is  no  requirement  under  the  Rules  that  the
    respondent should ask an appellant if he or  she  wishes  to  vary  the
    application so as to strengthen the application.

27.  For these reasons I re-make the decision and dismiss this appeal.
