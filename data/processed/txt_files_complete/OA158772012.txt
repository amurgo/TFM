Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms S Shafaatulla, instructed by J. R. Rahman
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Mathews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a national  of  the  United  States  of  America.   He
    encountered his fianc�e, Jillian Morrison, on Facebook.   They  decided
    they would like to get to know each other better.  After they had  been
    in contact electronically for over a year the  appellant  came  to  the
    United Kingdom as a visitor.  He met and stayed with her  and  returned
    to the USA on the last date allowed by his visa,  having  been  in  the
    United Kingdom for one day short of six months.   It  was  during  that
    time that they decided to get married.  The appellant's fianc�e  has  a
    sixteen-year old daughter who is at school in Scotland.  The  appellant
    presently has no dependants.  It is therefore  hardly  surprising  that
    they hoped to be able to live together  in  the  United  Kingdom  after
    their marriage.
 2. Following his return to the United  States,  therefore,  the  appellant
    applied on 25 April 2012 for entry clearance with a view to marriage to
    his fianc�e.  On 18 July 2012 his application was refused.  The refusal
    was based on paragraphs 290 and 320(18) and (19) of  the  Statement  of
    Changes in Immigration Rules, HC395 as they were  on  that  date.   The
    substantive requirements for fianc�es are those in para 290, and it  is
    now accepted that those requirements were met.  The refusal under  para
    320 was maintained by the Entry Clearance Officer, however, and was the
    subject of an appeal to Judge Quigley of the First-tier  Tribunal,  who
    after examining the circumstances of the  case  dismissed  the  appeal.
    The appellant now has permission to appeal to this Tribunal.

 3. Paragraph 320(18) and (19) read as follows:

        "Grounds on which entry clearance or  leave  to  enter  the  United
        Kingdom should normally be refused
        ...
        (18)   save  where  the  Immigration  Officer  is  satisfied   that
             admission would be justified for strong compassionate  reasons,
             conviction in any country including the United  Kingdom  of  an
             offence  which,  if  committed  in  the  United   Kingdom,   is
             punishable with imprisonment for a term of  12  months  or  any
             greater punishment or, if committed outside the United Kingdom,
             would be so punishable if the conduct constituting the  offence
             had occurred in the United Kingdom;
        (19)  where, from information available to the Immigration Officer,
             it seems right to refuse leave to  enter  on  the  ground  that
             exclusion from the United Kingdom is  conducive  to  the  pubic
             good; if, for example, in the light of the  character,  conduct
             or associations of the person seeking  leave  to  enter  it  is
             undesirable to give him leave to enter;

 4. Those paragraphs were relevant to the appellant's application,  because
    he has a criminal record in the  USA.   The  precise  content  of  that
    record is not absolutely clear.  The documents available to the  First-
    tier Tribunal and to us mention the  commencement  of  proceedings  for
    some very serious  offences,  but  having  examined  the  material  for
    ourselves we are perfectly  satisfied  that  the  appellant's  relevant
    convictions were for the following offences only: First, burglary of  a
    dwelling house, the circumstances being that he entered as a trespasser
    a neighbour's house and abstracted electricity from it for his own use,
    and, secondly, breach of bail or failure to attend court.  The combined
    sentence was five years imprisonment, apparently imposed on 4 May 2006.
     We have no access to any sentencing remarks.

 5. Before the First-tier Tribunal Judge there was a report from a Scottish
    solicitor,  giving  his  opinion  that,  if  those  offences  had  been
    committed in Scotland, the penalty would  have  been  very  much  less.
    Permission to appeal to this Tribunal  was  granted  primarily  on  the
    ground that Judge Quigley had not given sufficient  attention  to  that
    opinion.  Before us, Miss Shafaatulla argued that, if the  reality  was
    that, if they had been committed in Scotland, the  offences  would  not
    have attracted a custodial sentence, or only a short  one,  they  would
    not come within the wording of  para  320(18):  "if  committed  in  the
    United Kingdom, is punishable with imprisonment for a  term  of  twelve
    months or any greater punishment".

 6. There is no merit in that argument.  An offence is  "punishable"  in  a
    particular manner if the relevant statute (or, in the case of a  common
    law offence, the common law) permits that level of punishment  for  the
    offence as defined.  For immigration purposes the same concept  appears
    in s.3(6) of the Immigration Act 1971, which reads as follows:

           "... a person who is not a British citizen shall also be  liable
           to deportation from the United Kingdom if, after he has attained
           the age of 17, he is  convicted  of  an  offence  for  which  is
           punishable  with  imprisonment  and   on   his   conviction   is
           recommended for deportation by a court empowered by this Act  to
           do so".

 7. It is to be noted that the word used in  s.3(6)  is  "punishable",  not
    "punished":  that  distinction  demonstrates,  if  demonstration   were
    needed, that the meaning of "punishable" is directed not to the  actual
    punishment imposed, but to that which could have been imposed.  For the
    purpose of showing whether the appellant came within  s.  320(18),  the
    solicitor's opinion was entirely irrelevant.  There is  no  doubt  that
    housebreaking (burglary in England) is "punishable", both  in  Scotland
    and in England, with imprisonment for more than twelve months.

 8. Judge Quigley erred in treating the report as though it  were  relevant
    to the application of s. 320(18) to the appellant.

 9. That error perhaps made little or no difference to her determination of
    the appeal; but there have been at least three other errors in  dealing
    with the appellant's case.  We will deal  with  them  in  chronological
    order.  First, the Entry Clearance Officer misunderstood the meaning of
    para 320(18).   After  setting  out  the  wording  of  those  two  sub-
    paragraphs and noting the appellant's  conviction  for  "at  least  one
    criminal offence that could have carried a custodial sentence for  more
    than twelve months if that offence would have occurred  in  the  United
    Kingdom", the Entry Clearance Officer wrote this:


           "I have considered if there are any compassionate  circumstances
           of your application, however I note that you are  seeking  entry
           to the United Kingdom purely for settlement purposes.  I am  not
           satisfied that any such  circumstances  have  been  demonstrated
           that are of a sufficiently compelling nature for me to  exercise
           the powers of discretion granted to me by paragraph 320(18)  and
           (19) of the Immigration Rules.   The grounds of 320(18) and (19)
           therefore apply".

10. The Entry Clearance Manager's review simply confirmed the  decision  in
    those terms.

11. Para 320(18) sets out a process which is not that adopted by the  Entry
    Clearance Officer or the Entry Clearance Manager.  They each appear  to
    have thought that it would be the "compassionate reasons" envisaged  by
    the sub-paragraph that would motivate the application of the discretion
    envisaged by the word "normally" in the heading to that  part  of  para
    320.  That is wrong.  If there are "strong compassionate reasons", para
    320(18)  does  apply  at  all.   The  normal  refusal  under  para   18
    specifically applies only when the relevant officer is  not  "satisfied
    that admission would be justified for  strong  compassionate  reasons".
    Thus, deciding that there are no strong  compassionate  reasons  causes
    the question of discretion in sub-para  (18)  to  arise:  it  does  not
    answer it.  See F v ECO New York [2013] UKUT 00309 (IAC).

12. The second error was that the First-tier Tribunal Judge clearly thought
    that the appellant's criminal record was very much more extensive  than
    it was.  She set out  what  she  regarded  as  "quite  a  catalogue  of
    criminal  behaviour",  but  that  included  offences  with  which   the
    appellant was  charged  but  not  convicted,  and  offences  (including
    failing to stop at a road junction) which are not said to be punishable
    with imprisonment if committed in the United Kingdom.  In our judgement
    she misunderstood the evidence before her.

13. The third error relates to her decision under para  320(18)  and  (19).
    Although at para [23] of her determination, the judge sets out what she
    regards as potential  "compassionate  circumstances",  she  appears  to
    reach no judgement on whether para 320 (18)  applies;  and  so  far  as
    concerns sub-para (19), she says simply that she is "not  persuaded  by
    the argument that the Entry Clearance Officer erred in law by applying"
    it.  Her task was to decide, or additionally  to  decide,  whether  the
    discretion in  paras  320(18)  and  (19)  should  have  been  exercised
    differently.   She appears to have made no such decision.

14. The First-tier Tribunal Judge's errors  would  each  be  sufficient  of
    themselves to justify the setting aside of her determination and we  do
    so.

15. Looking at the matter anew, we have to decide whether it was  right  to
    refuse  the  appellant  entry  clearance,  given  that  he  meets   the
    substantive requirements of para 290.  We cannot condone his  offences,
    but it is clear that the penalty of five years imprisonment  represents
    a reaction to them which is at a quite different  level  from  what  it
    would be if the offences were committed in the United  Kingdom.   There
    have been no recent offences, and there is a strong measure of  support
    from community leaders who know him.  There is no  suggestion  that  he
    was any danger to the public of the United Kingdom when  he  was  here,
    lawfully as a visitor, within the twelve months before his application.
     He deserves credit for his decision, despite  the  permanence  of  the
    relationship he was entering into, to leave his  fianc�e  in  order  to
    return to the United States to make his application.

16. Looking at the matter as a whole we take the view  that  there  are  no
    such  "compassionate  reasons"  as  to   remove   para   320(18)   from
    consideration, but that  the  discretion  conferred  by  that  sub-para
    should have been exercised in the appellant's favour, taking his entire
    history into account.  In our judgement para 320(19) does not apply  to
    his case: there is no good reason for considering that he is  a  person
    whose exclusion is conducive to the public good.
17. For the foregoing reasons, having set aside the decision of the  First-
    tier Tribunal,  we  substitute  a  decision  allowing  the  appellant's
    appeal.
