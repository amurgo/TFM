                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

    1. The appellant is a national of Iran who came to the United Kingdom in
       October 2013.He has made a number of unsuccessful applications to
       remain. He initially claimed protection on the basis he had been
       lampooning clerics and officials in Iran and this placed him at risk.
       He also claimed that en route to the United Kingdom he experienced a
       conversion to Christianity. He also refers to keeping a Facebook
       account which reveals his conversion.

    2.  His original application was refused and his appeal was
       unsuccessful. At one stage he appealed to the Upper Tribunal which
       set aside an earlier decision of the First-tier Tribunal and remitted
       the matter back. However, the proceedings in the Upper Tribunal were
       not anonymized and were published on the directory of decisions
       freely available on the Internet.

    3. The appellant made further representations which were treated as a
       fresh claim. These were refused by the respondent on 20 June 2018.
       His appeal then came before First-tier Tribunal Judge J L Bristow at
       Birmingham on 6 August 2018. In a decision promulgated on 10 August
       2018 it was dismissed.

    4. First-tier Tribunal Judge Bristow heard from a Mr G V from the
       Christian church the appellant attended. The judge referred to an
       earlier decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Ford who rejected his
       claim about lampooning and concluded he was not wanted by the
       authorities because of any political opinion. The earlier judge had
       also rejected his claim conversion. First-tier Tribunal Judge J L
       Bristow referred to the Devaseelan principle.

    5. First-tier Tribunal Judge J L Bristow assessed the evidence about the
       appellant's conversion. The judge put limited weight upon the
       evidence of Mr GV who was from the church he attended. Whilst the
       judge accepted he was genuinely expressing his belief in the
       appellant but the judge was not satisfied the church had an adequate
       process of scrutiny.

    6. With regard to the published Upper Tribunal decision identifying the
       appellant, the judge noted it set out his claim including his claimed
       conversion. The decision records that the claim was not found to be
       credible. On this basis First-tier Tribunal Judge J L Bristow
       concluded that even if came to light it would not place the appellant
       at risk because the claim had been rejected.

The Upper Tribunal

    7. Permission to appeal was granted on the basis the judge failed to
       adequately assess the risk to the appellant at the point of return
       because of the published material on his Facebook page and in the
       Upper Tribunal decision about his claim conversion. AB and Others
       (internet activity - state of evidence) Iran [2015] UKUT 0257
       (IAC)was cited as it covers monitoring of blogging activity.

    8. Mr S Woodhouse appeared in the First-tier Tribunal hearing and has
       continued to represent the appellant now. I was referred to the
       grounds upon which permission was sought. In terms of the risk from
       online publications he pointed out the judge had accepted at
       paragraph 51 of the decision there was publication. The appellant's
       claim in the Upper Tribunal decision has not been anonymized. Mr
       Woodhouse argued that this risk was not abated by the argument that
       the Upper Tribunal rejected the claim. Rather, the claim had been
       remitted for determination de novo to the First-tier Tribunal. A
       further point he developed was the way the judge dealt with the
       evidence from the church, particularly that of Mr M V. I was referred
       to the Scottish decision of the Inner House  TF and MA v The
       Secretary of State for the Home Department [2018] CSIH 58 which
       analysed in detail the assessment of conversion claims and supportive
       evidence from church members.

    9. Mr Walker accepted that the judge did not adequately deal with the
       risk to the appellant because his name and claimed conversion was in
       the Upper Tribunal decision. This decision was publicised and was not
       anonymized. The judge was also rather dismissive of the church
       representatives. Having heard the arguments advanced he was in
       agreement that they indicated a material error of law.

   10. Having considered the points made I find there should have been a
       fuller analysis of the likely risk to the appellant at the point of
       return given the published material. The First-tier Tribunal judge
       did not have the benefit of the Scottish cases analysing church
       witnesses. I am in agreement with the parties that the decision does
       materially err in law and should be set aside. All parties agree the
       matter should be remitted for a de novo hearing in the First-tier. Mr
       Woodhouse is in agreement that there is no new evidence in relation
       to the claim in relation to imputed political opinions. It was
       therefore agreed that this was not being pursued at the rehearing.

Decision.

The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Bristow materially errs in law
and is set aside. The matter is remitted for a rehearing de novo in the
First-tier Tribunal.

       There have now been a number of cases in relation to conversions and
       the use of church witnesses which the parties may wish to consider:

       (ii)   SA (Iran) v Secretary of State for the Home Department (Iran)
       [2012] EWHC 2575

       (iii)  TF and MA v The Secretary of State for the Home Department
       [2018] CSIH 58.
