For the Appellant:     Mr E Nicholson (for Rainbow Solicitors)
For the Respondent:    Mr D Clarke (Senior Presenting Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is the appeal of Arshad [M], a citizen of Pakistan born 3  April
       1967, against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal (Judge  Watson)
       of 28 January 2019 dismissing his appeal on  asylum  grounds,  itself
       brought against the refusal of his human rights claim of 5 June 2018.



    2. The Appellant entered the UK on 22 June 2017 with a visit visa  valid
       to 18 December 2017. He applied for indefinite leave to remain on  28
       September 2017, an application that was refused on 5 June 2018.

    3. The Appellant had married his wife, the Sponsor Ms [B], on 15  August
       2000, in the UK. His wife entered the UK  in  2007  and  subsequently
       became a British  citizen.  Ms  [B]  had  visited  the  Appellant  in
       Pakistan over time. The Appellant's last UK visit began  on  22  June
       2017, and the application leading to  this  appeal  was  made  on  28
       September 2017.

    4. The Appellant's case before the First-tier Tribunal  was  essentially
       as follows. He was a businessman regularly travelling between the  UK
       and Pakistan.  He  maintained  his  relationship  with  his  wife  by
       visiting regularly, using the visit route  to  the  maximum  possible
       extent permitted by the Rules so as to remain in the UK for at  least
       half the time. This was realistic as he could maintain  his  business
       (which involved trading between the  UK  and  Pakistan)  from  either
       country. A family dispute had made  relations  with  the  Appellant's
       parents difficult at one time though they were now dead.

    5. They have four children, [F], [A], [Z] and [AA], aged 16, 14, 8 and 2
       at the date of the hearing below. In the Appellant's absence  Ms  [B]
       was  their  primary  carer.  However,   these   arrangements   became
       unrealistic as his wife's mental health had  deteriorated  in  recent
       times, such  that  she  was  unable  to  adequately  care  for  their
       children,  particularly  [A]  who  had  a  condition  called   Turner
       mosaicism requiring regular monitoring and growth hormone injections.



    6. Before the First-tier Tribunal there was  medical  evidence  that  Ms
       [B]'s physical health had deteriorated due to her anxiety as  to  the
       Appellant's immigration status. Anti-depressants had in fact led to a
       worsening of her stress-induced symptoms and she had been referred to
       Berkshire Adult Mental Health Services. The doctor  opined  that  she
       faced a likely deterioration in both her own health and her  capacity
       to care for the children without the Appellant.

    7. The First-tier  Tribunal  accepted  that  the  Appellant  had  always
       complied with immigration control and that there had been  some  kind
       of family dispute in the past with the Appellant's parents. Now  they
       were deceased, there was no reason why the Appellant's wife could not
       live in Pakistan. There was evidence  showing  remittances  from  the
       Appellant in Pakistan to his UK family, and  a  bank  account  showed
       funds of ï¿½68,000 held as of September 2016; various documents  showed
       evidence of his business's operations  in  2016,  and  confirmed  the
       Appellant's ownership of a house in Pakistan. Ms  [B]  suffered  from
       headaches and was  being  treated  with  antidepressants.  There  was
       medical evidence confirming [A]'s condition. Ms [B] was clearly  able
       to attend appointments with [A], and had done so for many years.

    8. The First-tier Tribunal  found  that  there  were  no  insurmountable
       obstacles to life in Pakistan. Ms [B] could cope with life  there  if
       required, albeit she might prefer to live in the  UK.  The  Appellant
       could not meet the requirements  of  the  Exception  provision  under
       Appendix FM, as this required him to satisfy the "parent"  definition
       which was not possible unless he had  sole  parental  responsibility.
       There were no unjustifiably  harsh  consequences  occasioned  by  the
       refusal, and essentially family life could continue as at present via
       visits between the UK  and  Pakistan.  There  was  nothing  shown  to
       adversely affect the children's welfare if their father  returned  to
       Pakistan, as they could continue their schooling and healthcare under
       their mother's supervision.

    9. Grounds of appeal contended that the First-tier Tribunal had erred in
       law in failing to determine the appeal by reference to the  mandatory
       statutory criteria governing the best interests  of  British  citizen
       children.

   10. The First-tier Tribunal granted permission to appeal on 7 March  2019
       on the basis the exception under the Immigration  Rules  should  have
       been considered.

   11. Before me Mr Clarke accepted that there were clear material errors of
       law in the decision, particularly the failure to  apply  the  section
       117B(6) legal framework. Given that there were in fact  four  British
       citizen children involved in the case, there was  only  one  rational
       outcome to the appeal, and he emphasised that the Secretary of  State
       could have no  reasonable  objection  to  the  appeal's  success.  Mr
       Nicholson expressed his agreement with admirable concision.

  Findings and reasons

   12. I accept that the First-tier Tribunal made material errors of law  in
       this appeal.

   13. Section 117B(6) of NIAA 2002 states:

           "117B Article 8: public interest  considerations  applicable  in
           all cases

           ...

           (6)   In the case of a person who is not liable to  deportation,
           the public interest does not require the person's removal where-

                (a)    the person has  a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
                relationship with a qualifying child, and

                (b)    it would not be reasonable to  expect  the  child  to
                leave the United Kingdom."

   14.  Quite  how  the  centrality  of  that  provision  to  the   appeal's
       disposition  eluded  the  First-tier  Tribunal  is  unclear;  it  was
       certainly not down to any lack of direction from Mr Nicholson,  whose
       written submissions had clearly referenced it. Given the stance taken
       by the Respondent on the appeal, it is clearly appropriate to proceed
       to remake the decision without any further hearing.

   15. The Appellant's childrens' nationality is  of  particular  importance
       because  it  brings  into  play  considerations  going  beyond  those
       present, for example, in the case of a foreign national child who has
       established seven years of residence in  the  UK.  As  was  noted  by
       Baroness Hale in ZH [2011] UKSC 4 relevant considerations in removing
       a British citizen child include  the  potential  deprivation  of  the
       practical benefits of that citizenship, "and of  its  protection  and
       support, socially, culturally and medically, and in many  other  ways
       evoked by, but not confined to,  the  broad  concept  of  lifestyle."
       However, these distinct benefits of British citizenship  were  simply
       not considered at all.

   16. The key question is the reasonableness of the departure from  the  UK
       of the British citizen  children.  Jackson  LJ  in  EV  (Philippines)
       [2014] EWCA Civ 874 at [35] stated: "A decision as to what is in  the
       best interests of children will depend on a number of factors such as
       (a) their age; (b) the length of time that they have been  here;  (c)
       how long they have been in education; (c) what stage their  education
       has reached; (d) to what extent they have become distanced  from  the
       country to which it is proposed that they return; (e)  how  renewable
       their connection with it may be; (f) to what extent  they  will  have
       linguistic, medical or other difficulties in adapting to life in that
       country; and (g)  the  extent  to  which  the  course  proposed  will
       interfere with their family life ..."

   17. Azimi-Moayed [2013] UKUT 197 (IAC) states that as a starting point it
       is in the best interests of  children  to  be  with  those  of  their
       parents who are their primary carers. If  a  parent  has  no  further
       right to remain in the United Kingdom then it is to be expected  that
       it is in the interests of a dependent child  to  follow  them  absent
       some particular reasons to the contrary. Stability and continuity  of
       social and educational provision, and an  upbringing  consonant  with
       the cultural norms of the society to which their parents belong,  are
       usually in their best interests.

   18. Elias LJ in MA (Pakistan) [2016] EWCA Civ 705  explained  that  wider
       public interest considerations had to  be  taken  into  account  when
       assessing the reasonableness of a child's relocation, beyond its best
       interests. The fact that a child has been here for seven  years  must
       be given significant weight when  carrying  out  the  proportionality
       exercise as was shown by the Secretary of State's published  guidance
       from August 2015 in which it is expressly stated that once the  seven
       years' residence requirement is satisfied, there need to  be  "strong
       reasons" for refusing leave, because after such a period of time  the
       child will have put down roots and  developed  social,  cultural  and
       educational links in the UK such that  it  is  likely  to  be  highly
       disruptive if the child is required to leave the  UK.   Nevertheless,
       it may be reasonable to require the child to leave  where  there  are
       good cogent reasons, even if they are not compelling.

   19. In MT and ET Nigeria [2018] UKUT 88 (IAC) the Upper Tribunal examined
       the best interests of the child where the  mother  and  daughter  had
       lived in the UK for around a decade (for the latter, from the age  of
       four to fourteen) by the time of the appeal hearing.  The  First-tier
       Tribunal found that the daughter had no memory  of  Nigeria  and  was
       well integrated in school and socially; it was clearly  in  her  best
       interests to remain in the UK. However, her mother had overstayed her
       original visit visa, pursued a false  asylum  claim  and  received  a
       community order for using a false document to obtain employment.  The
       uprooting from school and loss of her friends were  no  different  to
       the common experience of any child whose parents decided  to  make  a
       significant move abroad or otherwise.

   20.  The  Upper  Tribunal  disagreed  with  the   First-tier   Tribunal's
       assessment. It relied on MA Pakistan for the proposition  that  seven
       years' residence in the UK "establishes  as  a  starting  point  that
       leave should be granted unless there  are  powerful  reasons  to  the
       contrary". As it put it, it  was  necessary  to  look  for  "powerful
       reasons" why a child who has been in the United Kingdom for over  ten
       years should be removed, notwithstanding that her best interests  lie
       in remaining. Accordingly the mother was merely a somewhat run of the
       mill immigration offender who came to the United Kingdom on  a  visit
       visa, overstayed, made a claim for asylum that was found to be  false
       and who has pursued various legal means of remaining  in  the  United
       Kingdom: these were not sufficiently powerful reasons  to  counteract
       the child's best interests when assessing reasonableness: the  appeal
       was accordingly allowed.

   21. Drawing together the threads above, it is clear that, when  assessing
       the reasonableness of a child's relocation, stability and  continuity
       of social and educational provision, and an upbringing consonant with
       the cultural norms of the society to which their parents belong,  are
       usually in their best interests.   General  speaking  greater  weight
       will attach to the private life of children who have been  developing
       private life connections outside the family unit, and as  a  rule  of
       thumb residence from the age of  four  upwards,  when  the  child  is
       developing external ties, is particularly important.  For  qualifying
       British citizen children such as those present here, the Secretary of
       State needs to establish "strong reasons" justifying  the  childrens'
       departure as "reasonable".

   22. It is difficult to imagine a stronger case for  satisfaction  of  the
       partner route than one where there are not  less  than  four  British
       citizen children involved, two at a stage  of  their  schooling  when
       disruption could have significant consequences, and where one  has  a
       medical  condition  in  relation  to  which  she  has  established  a
       treatment regime in this country. It is also clear that the  mother's
       ability to care for the children will  be  significantly  compromised
       without her husband being able to  live  with  them  on  a  permanent
       basis. The elder children have lived in the  UK  for  much  of  their
       lives, the younger ones for all their lives. The other  section  117B
       factors of precariousness of residence, English language  proficiency
       and financial independence do not carry any significant weight  here:
       the Appellant's application during a period when he was present as  a
       visitor was essentially driven by  force  of  circumstances,  and  he
       clearly speaks English and is a successful businessman.

   23. Accordingly the appeal is allowed.

Decision

There is a material error of law in the decision appealed.

I remake the decision on the appeal by allowing the appeal.
