                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is an appeal by the Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department
    against the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Buckwell  and  Mr
    Jameson JP, sitting at Taylor House on 20 August 2014, in  which  by  a
    determination promulgated on 2 September 2014 they allowed  the  appeal
    of the claimant, Mr Okafor, against the decision of  the  Secretary  of
    State to make an order for his deportation to Nigeria as  a  result  of
    the commission of a criminal offence.

2.   The appeal was allowed both under the  provisions  of  the  Immigration
    (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 and by reference to Article 8
    of the European Convention for  the  Protection  of  Human  Rights  and
    Fundamental Freedoms.

3.   The determination sets out  the  salient  facts.   The  claimant  is  a
    citizen of Nigeria, born in 1958, whose immigration history is that  he
    entered the United Kingdom for the first time in July 1998 with an  EEA
    family permit. He then left the country  and  returned  with  a  second
    family permit in July 1999.  Again he left and once  more  returned  in
    June 2000, by reference to the EEA family permit.  He applied  for  the
    issue of a residence card, which was issued in July 2000,  valid  until
    2004. He was stated to be the family member of an EEA national  present
    in the United Kingdom.   He was granted  indefinite  leave  to  remain,
    according to the determination, under the EEA Regulations  in  February
    2004.  I am unsure of that matter; but it  is  immaterial  for  present
    purposes.

4.    An  application  for  naturalisation  for  British  citizenship   was,
    however, refused in March 2008.  The claimant returned  to  Nigeria  in
    March 2006.  It is not known for sure when  he  re-entered  the  United
    Kingdom but he came to the attention of the authorities in  2010,  when
    he was arrested for certain offences.  On 5 November 2010 the  claimant
    was convicted at Kingston-upon-Thames Crown Court  for  an  offence  of
    theft.  He was sentenced to five years'  imprisonment.   There  was  no
    appeal against the conviction or sentence.  The claimant  was  released
    from prison in March 2013.

5.   The offence for which the claimant was  imprisoned  arose  as  follows.
    The claimant was a solicitor of the Supreme Court. In the course of his
    practice as a solicitor he in effect defrauded various third parties of
    a total sum of some �633,000.   The  seriousness  of  that  offence  is
    underlined by the remarks of the judge who sentenced  the  claimant  to
    imprisonment. Amongst other matters, it was emphasised that because the
    money in question had not proved traceable,  the  Solicitors  Indemnity
    Fund had in effect had to shoulder the burden.  It seems that the money
    was dissipated in large part by the claimant in Nigeria.

6.   The panel heard evidence in that regard from  the  claimant.   He  said
    amongst other things that he had spent money in Nigeria  upon  his  own
    medical treatment and particularly upon treatment for a heart condition
    of his brother.  The sums  in  question  mentioned  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal at paragraph 23 of its determination amount to a total of some
    �52,000.

7.   At paragraph 25, it is  recorded  that  the  claimant  was  asked  some
    questions about his financial position, to which he replied that he did
    not have funds to move elsewhere  in  Nigeria  in  order  to  undertake
    treatment for his renal  condition  (to  which  I  shall  turn  in  due
    course).  Asked whether he had assets, the claimant referred to a  home
    in his village.

8.   The Secretary of State contended that the seriousness  of  the  offence
    and the consequences of it were such  as  to  make  it  appropriate  to
    deport the claimant pursuant to regulation 19 of the 2006  Regulations.



9.   The claimant's case as put  forward  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  was
    essentially as follows.   It was contended that he had  committed  what
    in effect was a one-off offence which was unlikely to be repeated.   He
    had received appropriate remedial training whilst  in  prison.  He  had
    shown no indication either before or since that offence  of  committing
    any other criminal offences.   He was as a consequence not a person who
    represented  a  genuine,  present  and  sufficiently   serious   threat
    affecting one of the fundamental  interests  of  society,  such  as  to
    render deportation appropriate.

10.  Furthermore, in  considering  the  proportionality  of  the  claimant's
    removal, great emphasis was placed upon his medical state.   In  short,
    he is suffering from  a  serious  renal  condition  which  renders  him
    dependent upon very regular dialysis. He is also on a waiting  list  to
    receive a new kidney. It seems from  the  evidence  that  the  claimant
    attempted whilst in Nigeria to obtain relief  from  this  condition  by
    seeking forms of traditional medicine which did not prove  satisfactory
    and that this lay behind his decision to return to the United Kingdom.

11.  The panel noted the seriousness of the offence.   That  is  plain  from
    paragraphs 45 of the determination.

12.  At paragraph 51, they noted, as I  have  already  indicated,  that  the
    claimant was previously of good character and there was

          "no evidence of a suspicion of a commission of any  other  offence
         since  his  discharge  from  prison.   I  find  that  he  did  take
         opportunities in prison to undertake further education  but  we  do
         not find on our assessment of the evidence in the round that on the
         current facts before us that the  claimant  represents  a  genuine,
         present and sufficiently serious threat to our society  to  justify
         removal".

13.  The panel then turned to the issue of  Article  8.   They  set  out  at
    paragraph 52 relevant case law.  They then noted at  paragraph  54  the
    significant health difficulties that the claimant faced.

14.  At paragraph 55, the panel came to the conclusion that if the  claimant
    had not otherwise succeeded in his appeal  then  "It  would  have  been
    appropriate for the  respondent  to  consider  that  the  appellant  be
    permitted  some  discretionary  leave  pending  a  potential   [kidney]
    transplant".  The panel noted that the information regarding  the  need
    for a transplant was not before the Secretary of State  when  she  took
    her decision to deport but that nevertheless it was relevant  to  their
    consideration of the Article 8 issue.

15.  Having set out their  conclusions  regarding  the  EEA  Regulations  at
    paragraph 57, at paragraph 58 the panel said this:

         "Additionally but in the alternative we  would  find  that  in  the
         particular circumstances the respondent would not  be  entitled  to
         apply Article 8 to the ECHR  in  response  to  the  engagements  of
         Article 8(1) ECHR rights with respect to  the  family  and  private
         life of the appellant in relation to Article 8 ECHR.   That  aspect
         of her decision would not be in accordance with the requirements of
         section 6(1) of the Human Rights Act 1998."

16.  The Secretary of State sought and obtained permission  to  appeal  that
    decision on a number of grounds. The first concerns the  issue  of  the
    claimant's financial circumstances.   It is contended that the claimant
    failed to provide an explanation as to what he did with the money  that
    he had obtained fraudulently from third parties.   The  grounds  submit
    "As he has not paid the money back it is submitted that he may still be
    benefiting from it".   This  led  to  the  assertion  that  whilst  the
    claimant may have been found to have been of good character  previously
    "his subsequent offending clearly shows he was not.  There was planning
    and preparation in advance of the actual theft of the money so this was
    not a one-off opportunistic crime".

17.  The panel's findings on the issue of funds are,  I  consider,  somewhat
    problematic.  I have taken account of the submissions Miss Nnamani  has
    put forward in this regard. It is plain from a number  of  passages  in
    the remarks of the sentencing judge that the view may  well  have  been
    taken that it was not possible to recover  any  money  because  it  was
    dissipated.   The matter, however, is far from clear, particularly when
    one looks at the details of sums expended in respect of the  claimant's
    own health needs in Nigeria and those needs of his brother, which  were
    recorded by the panel.

18.  It is perfectly possible for a Tribunal to come to the conclusion  that
    the entirety of the �600,000 or more has in effect been lost  and  that
    no significant part of these funds would be available to the  claimant,
    were he to be required to return to Nigeria  and  pay  for  the  health
    treatment there.  However, it is in  my  view  imperative  that  proper
    findings of fact should be made on this issue  and  I  find  myself  in
    agreement with the submission  of  the  Secretary  of  State  that  the
    determination is flawed for this reason.

19.  A further matter arises from this.   If,  following  investigation,  it
    does turn out that the entirety of that money has been lost, then  that
    is an issue which falls to be considered  in  the  context  of  whether
    deportation would be appropriate under the  2006  Regulations.   I  say
    that, because it reveals an aspect of this case which  the  panel   did
    not take into consideration; namely, whether it is proportionate to let
    a claimant who has stolen such a large sum and either dissipated it  or
    hidden it from view, to return to the United Kingdom  and  then  resist
    removal on the basis of his health needs.

20.  The second matter is whether or not the relevant  requirements  of  the
    Regulations have been met in this case.  In other words, is this a case
    where the personal  conduct  of  the  claimant  represents  a  genuine,
    present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one  the  fundamental
    interests of society?

21.  The panel came to the conclusion that the  claimant  would  not  repeat
    his  offence.   In  doing  so,  they  failed  to  have  regard  to  the
    submissions of the Secretary of State set out in the letter of refusal,
    upon which the Presenting Officer relied at the hearing.  It  is  true,
    as Miss Nnamani says, that paragraph 41 of the decision  letter  is  in
    error in assuming that the applicant did not undergo relevant  training
    programmes whilst in prison.  I do not,  however,  consider  that  that
    materially affects the thrust of paragraphs 43 and 44 of  the  decision
    letter, where the Secretary of State set out the nature of the  offence
    and that "It is considered reasonable to conclude that you  are  likely
    to reoffend should you find yourself in need of finances in the  future
    and continue to pose a risk of harm to the public or a section  of  the
    public".

22.  And then at paragraph 44:

          "The  seriousness  of  the  offence  in  the  light  of  the  full
         circumstances of its perpetration is indicative  that  you  pose  a
         significant threat to the safety and security of the public of  the
         United Kingdom.  It is considered that  should  you  reoffend  your
         offence will be of a similar or more serious nature and  that  your
         deportation is justified on serious grounds of public policy."

23.  In other words,  what  the  Secretary  of  State  was  saying  was  the
    frequently encountered and well-established principle that a person who
    may be at low risk of reoffending may nevertheless  pose  a  threat  by
    reason of the nature of the offence that he or she has committed,  such
    that, if recommitted, there would be serious consequences.

24   Miss  Nnamani,  with  her  characteristic  thoroughness,  attempted  to
    counter  this  by  saying  that,  taken  in  the  round,  the   panel's
    conclusions were sound.  It is, however, my view that  they  were  not.
    This is not to say that, on a re-evaluation of  the  matter,  the  view
    could  not  be  taken  that,  in  all  the  circumstances  and   having
    appropriate regard to the Secretary of State's views, the claimant  may
    still not be found to represent a sufficiently serious threat. But  any
    such finding would need  to  be  taken  by  express  reference  to  all
    relevant matters, including, importantly, the views of the Secretary of
    State, representing the public interest.  This  was  not  done  by  the
    panel.

25.  I turn finally to the issue  of  Article  8.   Any  problems  with  the
    Article 8 findings would, I agree with Miss Nnamani, be immaterial,  if
    there were no errors in relation to the EEA Regulations.  However,  for
    the reasons I have given, that is not the case.

26.  So far as Article 8 is concerned, the panel in my  view  committed  two
    discrete but related errors.  Firstly, it is with respect impossible to
    reconcile the comments  made  at  paragraph  55  of  the  determination
    regarding  the  potential  appropriateness  of   being   granted   some
    discretionary leave pending a potential transplant with  the  firm  and
    unparticularised statement  in  paragraph  58  that  deportation  would
    violate Article 8 of the ECHR.  This is particularly so, given that the
    case law referred to in paragraphs 52 and  54 is somewhat partial.

27.  The second error that the panel committed was in not having  regard  to
    the matters required to be looked at  by  reason  of  Part  5A  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  That set  of  provisions
    came into force at the end of July 2014, with  immediate  effect.   The
    hearing in the present case took place on 20  August.   In  particular,
    section 117C has important  things  to  say  regarding  the  view  that
    Parliament has expressed of where the public interest lies in the  case
    of a person who has committed a criminal offence leading to a  sentence
    of imprisonment of four years or more.

28.  For these reasons, I  find  that  there  are  material  errors  in  the
    determination of the First-tier Tribunal.  I have considered whether it
    is appropriate to proceed at the Upper Tribunal level to reconsider the
    relevant matters and make findings of fact where appropriate.   In  all
    the circumstances, I do not consider that it is appropriate.  There  is
    a need for fresh-fact finding in this case and the application to those
    facts of the relevant law.  The nature and extent of that task are such
    that I consider it is in all the circumstances proportionate  for  this
    matter to be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal, for an entirely fresh
    consideration of all relevant issues.

29.  For these reasons the Secretary of State's appeal is allowed.
