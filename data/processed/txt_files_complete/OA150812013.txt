Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms Carina Ward, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr Chris Avery (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Simpson promulgated on 1st April 2014,  following  a  hearing  at
    Taylor House on 25th March  2014.   In  the  determination,  the  judge
    allowed the appeal of Zamira  Vatnikaj.   The  Respondent  subsequently
    applied for, and  was  granted,  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.





The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a female, a citizen of Albania, who was born  on  26th
    May 1986.  She appealed against the decision  of  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer, dated 21st June 2013, refusing her leave to enter  the  UK  as
    the spouse of a person present and settled in the UK, who  was  also  a
    British citizen, namely, Mr Lazer Vatnikaj.

The Appellant's Claim

 3. The Appellant's claim raised that her husband was an Albanian  citizen,
    who had lived in the UK for the past sixteen years, was settled in this
    country,  had  taken  British  citizenship,  and  had   always   worked
    gainfully, never claiming  state  benefits  (paragraph  4).   When  her
    husband visited Albania subsequently they met, became engaged, and were
    married with the blessings of both their parents and  on  10th  January
    2014 a son was born to them, who is now a  British  citizen  (paragraph
    5).  The Appellant herself underwent extreme complications which almost
    deprived her of her life, following the birth of her son.  The  Sponsor
    produced wage slips and letters from his two employers.  He produced  a
    payslip from Stockvale Catering  dated  20th  June  2013  which  showed
    gainful employment and he also showed his  employment  with  the  Lemon
    Tree Restaurant.  His combined income was the equivalent of �21,777.

The Judge's Findings

 4. The judge was satisfied that the Appellant earned almost  �22,000  from
    his two employments and there was no issue  relating  to  accommodation
    (paragraph 11).  The judge was also satisfied that family life  existed
    between the Appellant, her husband and their young  son  and  that  the
    decision of the Respondent interfered with his family  life  in  a  way
    that was not reasonable and proportionate.  The  judge  did  take  into
    account the balance of interests of the Respondent against those of the
    Appellant, and whilst it was accepted that the Appellant could not meet
    the technical requirements of the Immigration Rules, he  could  succeed
    under free-standing Article 8 jurisprudence (paragraph 13).  The appeal
    was allowed.

Grounds of Application

 5. The grounds of application state that with respect  to  the  Article  8
    ECHR, a separate assessment should have been carried out whether  there
    were compelling circumstances, which were not recognised by the  Rules,
    following the judgment in Gulshan [2013] UKUT 00640, and the failure to
    do so rendered the judgment unsafe.

 6. On 29th May 2014, permission to appeal was granted.

Submissions

 7. At the hearing before me on 22nd July  2014,  Mr  Avery,  appearing  on
    behalf of the Respondent Secretary of State, submitted that there  were
    a number of errors in the determination of the judge.  First, there was
    no evidence of a second employment so the Sponsor's annual gross income
    was in doubt at the date of the application.  Second, as far as Article
    8 was concerned, the judge had disregarded the requirements of Appendix
    FM because it was not clear from  the  information  supplied  that  the
    Sponsor was receiving income from his employment which could be matched
    with the bank statement.  Finally, the case  of  Gulshan  had  made  it
    clear that it was necessary to show compelling circumstances before  an
    appeal could be allowed under Article 8 ECHR grounds.

 8. For her part, Ms Ward relied upon her helpful  skeleton  argument.   In
    essence, Ms Ward submitted that, although the judge had  not  in  terms
    referred to Gulshan [2013] UKUT 00640, it was plain that  the  approach
    in that case was one that informed the judge in coming to his decision.



 9. This is clear from the fact that, the judge recognises  at  the  outset
    that the Appellant cannot succeed under the Immigration Rules.  He then
    has regard to factors that are clearly "exceptional" in the sense  that
    there is the birth now of a child who is a British citizen child and of
    a father who is settled in the UK and has always worked and  been  able
    to provide for himself and his family, in  circumstances  where  family
    life exists and has been unquestioned.

10. All this was set out at paragraphs 11 to 13 of the  determination.   In
    particular, the judge was clear that

         "The husband is an industrious man who at the time  of  application
         was holding down two  employments  together  earning  him  annually
         almost �22,000, well exceeding the �18,600 threshold.  There is  no
         issue about their intention to live together permanently  or  about
         accommodation" (paragraph 11).

11. In these circumstances, it was clear that the judge was able  to  leave
    the code of the Immigration Rules and consider the position under free-
    standing Article 8 jurisprudence.  Secondly, it was simply not the case
    that the income that the Sponsor claimed to earn was not  reflected  in
    the bank account.  The failure to meet the Immigration Rules was not on
    this account at all.  The reason why the Appellant  could  not  succeed
    under the Immigration Rules was because the Sponsor had, at the time of
    the application been unable to  provide  a  letter  from  his  employer
    confirming his employment, although such a letter was provided  at  the
    hearing before Judge Simpson.

12. Finally, and in any event, Ms Ward  submitted  that  under  the  latest
    jurisprudence of MM (Lebanon), the court had made it clear in the words
    of Lord  Justice  Aikens  that  normally  "References  to  'exceptional
    circumstances' in the code will nonetheless  entail  a  proportionality
    exercise".  The quote went on to say that  if  the  Rules  were  not  a
    "complete code" then "The proportionality test will be more  at  large,
    albeit guided by Huang tests  and  the  UK  and  Strasbourg  case  law"
    (paragraph 134).

13. Clearly, therefore, submitted Ms  Ward,  Strasbourg  jurisprudence  was
    entirely relevant to the situation before the judge in this case.

14. In reply, Mr Avery submitted that he had nothing further to add.



No Error of Law

15. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  did  not
    involve the making of an error on a point of law such that I should set
    aside the decision of the original judge and remake the decision  under
    Section 12(1) of TCEA 2007.  My reasons for so concluding are that this
    is nothing more than a disagreement with  the  decision  of  the  judge
    below by the Respondent.  It is well established  that  for  the  Upper
    Tribunal to intervene in a case such as this, the decision  below  must
    be shown as "perverse" or "irrational" and that this is  "a  very  high
    hurdle" see R (Iran)  [2005]  EWCA  Civ  982  at  paragraph  11.   That
    threshold has not been crossed in submissions before this  Tribunal  to
    me.

16. It is clear that the judge had held that the Appellant could  not  meet
    the strict requirements of the Immigration Rules.  The  judge  did  not
    then allow the appeal under the Immigration Rules.  Instead, he  looked
    at the position under the Human Rights Act.  He was aware that,  "There
    is no mention of the  application  being  considered  of  human  rights
    grounds" by the Entry Clearance Officer (see paragraph 10).   In  doing
    so, he set out the relevant  circumstances  which  were  clearly  of  a
    "compelling" nature  in  the  appeal  before  him,  setting  these  out
    carefully at paragraphs 11 to 13,  and  making  sure  that  these  were
    weighed "In the balance [with] the interest of the  Respondent  against
    those of the Appellant" (paragraph 13).

17. A genuine family life existed between the Appellant,  her  Sponsor  and
    the infant  child  and  they  enjoyed  family  life,  which  was  being
    prevented now by the Respondent's decision.  But most importantly,  the
    judge took into account "The interests of  the  child  which  are  best
    served by living in a loving family atmosphere with  both  his  parents
    which leads me to the conclusions that  the  Respondent's  decision  is
    disproportionate and cannot stand" (paragraph 13).

18. All of this was done without a reference to Section 55 BCI  2009  under
    which the "best interests of the child"  would  plainly  have  led  the
    judge under domestic law to the same conclusion.  In short, there is no
    error of law here and certainly no  "material"  error  of  law  in  the
    determination.  The determination stands.

Decision

19. There is no material error of law in  the  original  judge's  decision.
    The determination shall stand.

20. No anonymity order is made.
