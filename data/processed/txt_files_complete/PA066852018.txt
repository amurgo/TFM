Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Murphy, Counsel, instructed by City Heights
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms Everett, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is the remaking of the decision in the appellant's appeal  against
    the respondent's refusal of his protection and human rights claim.




 2. The appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh. He sought leave to remain  in
    the UK on the basis that he is an openly gay man of Hindu heritage,  in
    a relationship with a male partner of Muslim faith. He claimed  adverse
    treatment in Bangladesh as a result  of  a  gay  relationship  in  that
    country, following which he  had  suffered  attacks  and  had  to  flee
    Bangladesh, and his parents also suffered adverse attention and had  to
    flee that country.


 3. In terms of the appellant's immigration  history  as  recorded  in  the
    respondent's  subsequent  decision  to  refuse  his  application,   the
    appellant first entered the UK on 23 January 2010 on a Tier 4 (General)
    Student visa, valid until 31 July  2013.   The  appellant's  leave  was
    curtailed in 2012, but that curtailment was reconsidered  in  2014  and
    'not pursued'. On 23 July 2013, whilst the appellant  still  had  valid
    leave to remain, he applied for further leave to remain  as  a  Tier  4
    (General) Student, which was  refused.  The  refusal  was  subsequently
    maintained on 25 August 2015.  The appellant was served with notice  of
    liability to removal on 11 August 2017 and claimed asylum on 5 November
    2017. The respondent refused the appellant's application in a  decision
    (the 'Refusal Letter') dated 15 May  2018.    The  respondent  accepted
    that the appellant came from Bangladesh but did  not  accept  that  the
    appellant was gay as claimed. The Refusal  Letter  did  not  go  on  to
    consider whether the appellant would be likely to conceal his sexuality
    out of fear of persecution; if he were perceived  as  gay,  whether  he
    would suffer  adverse  interest  at  a  level  such  as  to  amount  to
    persecution; or the sufficiency of protection or viability of  internal
    relocation in Bangladesh.




 4. On 3 October 2019,  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Courtney  (the  'FtT')
    dismissed the appellant's appeal against the refusal of his  protection
    and human rights claims. She did not accept that the appellant was gay,
    for the reasons summarised at ï¿½6 of the error-of-law decision  of  this
    Tribunal.


 5. The appellant  lodged  grounds  of  appeal,  the  gist  of  which  were
    summarised by First-tier Tribunal Judge Fisher, granting permission  on
    14 November 2018, as being  that  the  FtT  had  erred  in  failing  to
    consider the  evidence  of  the  appellant's  partner  and  the  second
    witness, HH, whose honesty was not challenged.


 6. This Tribunal set aside the FtT's decision, allowing the appeal without
    any  preserved  findings  of  fact.   This  Tribunal  regarded  it   as
    appropriate to remake the decision, noting the availability of evidence
    and narrowness of the issues (albeit their seriousness).


The core of the Appellant's claim


 7. The appellant says he is a gay man and that he has a well-founded  fear
    of persecution by reason of his sexuality. He fears the family  of  his
    ex-lover, the Islamic militants who he says would take  action  against
    him due to Facebook entries, the authorities (given  that  sex  between
    men is a crime in Bangladesh) and Islamic extremists whom the appellant
    says have threatened him.

The gist of the respondent's refusal

 8. The core point taken against the appellant in the  Refusal  Letter  was
    that the respondent did not accept that the appellant is gay  in  light
    of:

      a. Asserted inconsistences as to  whether  the  appellant  had  had  a
         relationship in Bangladesh

      b. The appellant's claimed fear  of  persecution  while  asserting  an
         ignorance in laws prohibiting homosexuality in Bangladesh

      c. The fact that the appellant's  documentary  evidence  of  gay  club
         memberships post-date the appellant's protection claim

      d. The similarity of letters from supporters of the appellant.

 9. The respondent also did not accept  the  authenticity  or  accuracy  of
    hospital  treatment  said  to  corroborate  the   alleged   attack   in
    Bangladesh.

10. The respondent further took issue with the  late  stage  at  which  the
    appellant claimed asylum, referring to section 8 Asylum and Immigration
    (treatment of Claimants etc) Act 2004 in light of the appellant  having
    arrived in the UK in  2010  on  alternative  rejected  bases  but  only
    claiming asylum in 2017 following service of a notice of  liability  to
    removal.

The issues in this appeal


11. The sole issue in remaking the FtT's decision is whether the  appellant
    is gay. Credibility is a key issue.

12. At the hearing, the respondent accepted that if the appellant  is  gay,
    he would have a well-founded fear  of  persecution  by  reason  of  his
    sexuality, and questions of living openly,  sufficiency  of  protection
    and internal relocation were not in issue.

Documents

13. The appellant provided an electronic bundle  of  documents  running  to
    some 322 pages, including:

     a.  witness statements from himself, his asserted partner HH, Mr  Hizir
        Tezgel and his girlfriend  Ms  Ozlem  Sungurlu,  Mr  William  George
        Brewis and Mr Rezaul Karim Fakir

     b. Various supporting letters, ID cards  of  the  appellant's  parents,
        lodger  agreements,  copies  of   Facebook   entries,   photographs,
        membership cards

     c. News reports and Home Office Country Policy  and  Information  Note,
        version 3.0, dated November 2017.

14. The respondent referred us  to  the  most  recent  Country  Policy  and
    Information Note (CPIN), version 4.0, dated April 2020.

The Hearing

15. The appellant attended the hearing and gave evidence through a  Bengali
    interpreter. HH, Mr William George Brewis and  Mr  Rezaul  Karim  Fakir
    appeared as witnesses. All were cross-examined.

The appellant's submissions/evidence at the hearing

Written statement

16. The key points arising from the appellant's witness statement were that
    he was a national of Bangladesh born into a conservative Hindu  family.
    He became aware of his sexuality in May 2008  when  he  was  around  17
    years old. He was in a homosexual relationship  in  Bangladesh  with  a
    Muslim man, RM, from November 2008 to 7 April 2009.  This  relationship
    ended when, on  7  April  2009,  RM's  elder  brother  discovered  them
    engaging in sexual relations. The same day, the elder brother  attacked
    the appellant and exposed the relationship to the appellant's  parents,
    threatening them to keep the relationship a secret. The appellant  felt
    forced to flee for his life. He came to the UK on 23 January 2010.

17. Since being in the UK, the appellant said he  had  noticed  gay  people
    being accepted in society and so felt able to life openly as a gay  man
    himself. He initially had many casual relationships with men he met  at
    gay clubs but has been in a serious relationship  with  HH,  a  Muslim,
    since October 2015. The appellant and HH first met in January 2015  but
    were separated from March to September 2015. Since 31 October 2015 they
    have been living as a gay couple.

18. The appellant claimed asylum on 15 November 2017 following an  incident
    where HH on 17 October 2017 drunkenly posted  intimate  photographs  of
    the two of them together on Facebook. As a  result  of  this  incident,
    HH's parents became aware of their relationship and threatened to  kill
    the appellant if he returned to Bangladesh. The appellant also received
    threatening telephone calls from unknown numbers.

19. The appellant says his family were  'tortured'  as  a  result  of  this
    incident, and as Hindus, were also tortured due to the appellant  being
    in a homosexual relationship with a Muslim man.  His family were forced
    to flee Bangladesh in December  2017  due  to  the  threats  they  were
    receiving.  They are now living in India. His father and  brother  have
    disowned him and his mother  is  the  only  one  supporting  him.  Some
    extended family members remain in Bangladesh but the appellant says  he
    will suffer prejudice and ill treatment from them.

20. The appellant says he has a genuine fear  of  persecution  from  Muslim
    fundamentalists, Bangladeshi society in general,  his  extended  family
    members, RM's elder brother  and  Bangladesh  as  a  state,  being  the
    government/army and the police. It is a criminal  offence  to  practice
    homosexuality in Bangladesh and he fears for his life. If  returned  he
    will be forced to live discreetly.

21. The appellant says he suffers from severe depression and mental  health
    issues and has attended MIND counselling sessions. He considers he will
    become mentally insane if returned.  He has also contacted his local MP
    Mr Clive Efford for assistance with his asylum application.

The appellant's oral evidence

22. In oral evidence the appellant said he  first  came  to  the  UK  as  a
    student. He confirmed that he applied for a student  visa  in  December
    2009 after the incident with RM (this was verified by reference to  the
    visa application dated 8 December 2009). After that incident he was  in
    hospital for two weeks and only his mother and brother  came  to  visit
    him. His father and other brothers did  not  come.  He  applied  for  a
    student visa after it became clear his  life  was  in  danger.  Between
    leaving his home area in April 2009 and arriving in the UK  in  January
    2010, the appellant stayed in Dhaka having  been  taken  there  by  his
    mother and brother  who  arranged  a  house  for  him.  They  told  the
    appellant not to leave the house unless it was essential. He had one or
    two friends in Dhaka. His friend helped him with his passport.

23. The appellant confirmed that when he came to study in the UK  he  never
    thought of going back to Bangladesh. He sought legal advice when making
    his further student application in the UK and asked how could  he  stay
    here. The lawyer, a legal advisor, told him he could apply under  human
    rights and even stay for a long time but even then could be refused. He
    could not recall when this was.

24. The appellant confirmed his sexuality was exposed to his parents  as  a
    result of the incident with RM, when RM's brother told the  appellant's
    family that their son had done bad things with  RM.  The  brother  said
    nobody should know about the matter otherwise it would be bad  for  the
    appellant's parents' dignity.

25. The appellant used to go to college but  the  college  shut  down.  His
    mother paid for the course from Bangladesh. When he  first  arrived  at
    the airport one of his friend's cousins collected him and he stayed  at
    that friend's house for two days. He then lived in a house in  Dulston,
    saying one of his college friends used to live  there  and  helped  him
    arrange the house. The appellant has no relatives in the UK.

26. The appellant confirmed the address  where  he  and  HH  first  resided
    together was one address, but recently  they  had  moved  to  a  second
    address. The appellant was  shown  a  letter  dated  18  December  2017
    addressed to HH at a third address which was at  odds  with  the  claim
    that they were living together at the first address. The appellant said
    he did not know how HH managed to receive that letter at  that  address
    as they were living together at the time, and thought  it  was  because
    HH's address had not been changed with his GP. The  appellant  said  he
    had not seen the letter and HH had not told him about it but he knew HH
    had not changed his address with his GP. The appellant was directed  to
    the fact that the letter formed part of the documents given in  support
    of his claim at his Asylum Interview. The appellant said  he  did  give
    the letters for HH's medical conditions but didn't know the old address
    was on the letter; he had told HH to change his address with the GP and
    it was not something that affected the appellant.

27. The appellant was then  directed  to  printouts  from  his  doctor  and
    prescriptions for his medication in the appellant's bundle  which  both
    showed another, fourth, address. The appellant explained that he  first
    came to the UK, he saw the doctor  near  the  fourth  address  as  that
    doctor saw lots of Bangladeshi people and was easy  to  understand;  he
    had not changed his address with this doctor. He did live at the fourth
    address a long time ago, maybe 2013-2014.

28. The appellant was directed to the lodger agreements  at  pages  130-133
    appellant's bundle, none of which contains an  address.  It  was  noted
    that they are all between the landlord and appellant and  HH,  for  one
    double room at a rent of ï¿½300 per month. The appellant confirmed  these
    related to the first address. They had to pay rent there but could  not
    pay it on time and did not have a good relationship with the  landlord.
    The first address is the address used by the  appellant's  MP  when  he
    wrote on 15 June 2018. The appellant explained that the reason why  the
    MP had his current address whilst his GP had an old address is  because
    he doesn't receive letters from his GP,  only  emails  and  phonecalls.
    Medicine is ordered via an app.  He  kept  his  GP  as  he  speaks  his
    language. He used to travel  some  way  to  see  this  GP  but  doesn't
    currently due to covid.

29. The appellant confirmed he currently lives at the second  address  rent
    free, having starting living there in January 2020. The appellant  said
    he found this address  having  seen  small  stickers  on  a  window  in
    Whitechapel asking for a caretaker. Him and HH share one of  two  rooms
    in the house and are able to live rent free as they take  care  of  the
    landlord. The landlord does not pay for this care  but  sometimes  buys
    food for the appellant and HH and gives them money to buy him shopping.
    Otherwise, the  appellant  is  not  working  and  neither  is  HH.  The
    appellant does not have a proper bank account but has a monzo card.

30. In answer to whom was supporting him financially, the appellant replied
    that he and HH do not spend much money and live a very simple life.  If
    they need money they ask their friend Mr Fakir. The appellant said  his
    parents do not support him financially as their situation is  now  very
    bad and they cannot afford it. The appellant said he sometimes contacts
    his mother. His father signed a statement in support of  him  but  does
    not to talk to him.

31. The appellant confirmed he was a non-practising Hindu and HH is a  non-
    practising Muslim. He said he had lived with HH for around  five  years
    and their relationship was serious.   They have discussed marriage  and
    had an appointment at East London Registry Office last year  but  could
    not get married due to ID problems. They have not thought about  having
    children.

32. The appellant said HH has no family in the UK but his family are  aware
    that the appellant and HH are together. They did not live near  to,  or
    know, each other in Bangladesh.

33. The appellant said before 2017 he did not know about  asylum;  he  only
    knew that asylum could be sought for political reasons or problems like
    war. He confirmed that between 2015 and  2017  he  had  no  immigration
    leave to be in the  UK  but  he  never  thought  about  going  back  to
    Bangladesh. He did not contact the Home Office at the time  because  he
    understood them to have given some kind of contract to a company called
    Capita from whom he used to receive phonecalls saying  they  were  told
    they had to catch and deport him, so he went into hiding. When  he  was
    in hiding his friends sometimes helped him and his mother supported him
    from Bangladesh before he claimed asylum.

34. The appellant confirmed HH was studying when he came to the UK and  did
    not finish his course. HH never told the appellant why he didn't finish
    his course but said colleges frequently get shut  down.  The  appellant
    didn't think HH had immigration leave when they met.

35. In answer to whether he and HH ever discussed getting legal advice, the
    appellant said they didn't think about it when they found each other as
    they were living in a good situation and were  always  scared  that  if
    they contacted the Home Office they may be returned to  Bangladesh.  HH
    was not working when they met; he repeated that sometimes their  friend
    helped them and they lived a simple life.

36. The appellant confirmed he and HH did not live together when they first
    met and he thought HH was living in Stratford. He never asked who  paid
    for HH's studies. They first met in a club. He was able to go to  clubs
    because his mother sent him money from Bangladesh. In answer to what HH
    was living  on  in  2015,  the  appellant  thought  maybe  HH's  family
    supported him as well but they did not talk about it  and  before  they
    started living together he did not ask. They started living together at
    the end of October 2015. The appellant thought HH's parents, his mother
    in particular, were supporting him from 2015-2017.  The  appellant  has
    never spoken to HH's mother. Before the asylum claim, HH's parents  did
    not know they were living together, they only found out  when  HH  sent
    posts to Facebook.

37. The appellant confirmed he met Mr Fakir towards the  end  of  2017.  In
    answer to whether he knew when Mr Fakir claimed asylum,  the  appellant
    said he didn't know when he made the claim but Mr Fakir told  him  once
    it had been granted. The appellant was unclear about when he understood
    Mr Fakir to have applied for and/or been granted asylum.  Initially  he
    said Mr Fakir did not tell him when exactly it was granted but told him
    it had been granted due to his homosexuality. The appellant thought  Mr
    Fakir already had asylum when they first  met.  They  did  discuss  the
    appellant's immigration status and that was why Mr  Fakir  was  at  the
    hearing, to support the appellant. The appellant said they did not talk
    about it when they first met but once they got to know each other  well
    the appellant asked Mr Fakir what can be done  about  claiming  due  to
    homosexuality and Mr Fakir confirmed it  was  possible.  The  appellant
    then said he met Mr Fakir after the appellant had made the  claim,  and
    it was after he told Mr Fakir that he had made a claim  that  Mr  Fakir
    had agreed to help him. He made the claim for asylum, and then  met  Mr
    Fakir towards the end of 2017. The appellant was questioned again about
    whether, when they first discussed asylum on grounds of  homosexuality,
    Mr Fakir said he had already been granted asylum - the  appellant  said
    yes, because he was homosexual and he met him at the gay club with  his
    friend. The appellant didn't know the date  when  he  became  aware  Mr
    Fakir had been granted asylum but he thought it was before they met and
    it was after the appellant had claimed asylum.

38. The appellant met Mr Brewis in November 2019 and visited him frequently
    at Mr Brewis's house in the Kennington  area,  sometimes  spending  the
    night. The appellant discussed his claim with Mr  Brewis  who  said  he
    would give evidence. Mr Brewis never visits the appellant; he  goes  to
    Mr Brewis as he lives alone. The appellant knew Mr Brewis and Mr  Fakir
    knew each other but did not know how they met.

HH

Written statement

39. In his statement HH confirmed he is a national of Bangladesh, was  born
    in a strict Muslim family,  identifies  as  a  homosexual  and  is  the
    appellant's partner. He has been in a relationship with  the  appellant
    since 31 October 2015 and living together for the past 2.8 years  (this
    appears to be a typographical error - the timeframe having been carried
    over from a previous version of  the  statement).  They  first  met  in
    January 2015 at GAY Late Club in Soho. As their  friendship  progressed
    they found out they were both homosexuals. Whilst they  have  different
    religions, they have experienced the same struggles as  homosexual  men
    from  Bangladesh.  HH's  religion  is,   he   stated,   an   enemy   of
    homosexuality.

40. HH has always identified as  a  homosexual.  He  was  in  a  homosexual
    relationship with a Muslim partner in Bangladesh, which terminated when
    their sexuality was exposed.  He  was  badly  beaten  up  whilst  being
    intimate with his partner. He had to flee Bangladesh on 1 December 2009
    to save his life.

41. HH and the appellant live openly in the UK as a gay couple.

42. On  17  October  2017  HH  drunkenly  posted  intimate  photographs  on
    Facebook, after which his family became  aware  of  his  sexuality  and
    relationship with a Hindu male and sent online abuse and threats to the
    appellant, also via Facebook. The appellant also  received  threatening
    telephone calls from unknown numbers.

43. HH considers both he  and  the  appellant  would  face  persecution  in
    Bangladesh due to their past homosexual relationships there.

HH's oral evidence

44. HH gave evidence through the Bengali interpreter.

45. HH confirmed that he and the appellant get raised eyebrows and  stifled
    jeers  from  the  Muslim  community  in  the  UK   because   of   their
    homosexuality. When they go out they hold hands  and  walk  freely  but
    this is against their religion. HH is not a practising Muslim  and  the
    appellant is not a practising Hindu.

46. HH and the appellant met in 2015 at a gay nightclub. At the time HH was
    not working. His friends were helping him financially. He got financial
    support from his parents in 2015 but they have disowned him now and  do
    not support him.

47. In answer to what he was living on now, HH said where they live at  the
    moment they do not pay rent because  the  landlord  is  very  kind  and
    elderly and they look after him. They moved to their current address in
    January 2020.  In terms of buying food or clothes, HH's friend Mr Fakir
    helps sometimes and they do not buy too many clothes.

48. When HH first met the appellant, the appellant was not working. It  was
    after about seven months that they discussed their  immigration  status
    and the fact that neither of them had a right to be  in  the  UK.  When
    they began living together they discussed getting  some  legal  advice.
    They decided they could not go to Bangladesh as  they  were  homosexual
    and would be killed. They spoke  to  an  immigration  lawyer  and  then
    claimed asylum. Prior to 2017 HH had not taken any legal  advice  about
    staying in the UK.

49. HH confirmed he knew Mr Fakir and that he had been granted  asylum,  he
    thought in 2017. They met three years ago. When asked whether Mr  Fakir
    already had asylum when HH met him, HH said "I met him  in  the  club".
    When asked again whether Mr Fakir has asylum when they met, HH  replied
    "not in the club, but afterwards'. HH said Mr Fakir was granted  asylum
    after they met and was granted it as a homosexual man. When  questioned
    again whether Mr Fakir was granted asylum before or after  HH  has  met
    him, HH said "I can't remember, I know him last three years".  He  said
    they were very close friends. When asked  about  how  soon  into  their
    relationship did HH and Mr Fakir talk about asylum issues, being gay in
    Bangladesh and the difficulties they faced, HH said "When  I  made  the
    application for asylum, sometime before that". When asked if  this  was
    sometime before the appellant applied, HH said "there was  an  incident
    for us through Facebook and then we went to the club, we spoke to Fakir
    and David". HH then said Mr Fakir suggested applying for  asylum.  When
    questioned whether, following this suggestion, HH asked Mr Fakir if  he
    himself had been granted asylum, HH  replied  "nah,  David  is  British
    nationality". HH later said Mr Fakir didn't  tell  them  about  asylum,
    David did, and Mr Fakir was not with David at the time.

50. HH said before 2017 he did not know asylum  could  be  claimed  on  the
    basis he was a homosexual from Bangladesh. When asked when he found out
    Mr Fakir had been granted asylum on this basis, HH said  after  he  had
    got it; he didn't remember when; "when he got  it  he  told  us".  When
    asked whether they celebrated together HH said "we had  drinks  because
    sometimes when we get together we  drink  beer".  When  pressed  as  to
    whether HH was told by Mr Fakir that he had  been  granted  asylum,  HH
    could or  would  not  answer  the  question  directly,  giving  several
    different incoherent answers.

51. HH confirmed the appellant was not in touch with his  family  in  India
    because they don't like the appellant and HH's homosexuality. HH didn't
    know when the appellant was last in touch with his mother but knows  he
    used to talk to her. He confirmed they were still in touch in 2017  but
    didn't remember about 2018. She knew the appellant had  claimed  asylum
    in the UK because they made a statement in support  of  him.  HH  later
    said that the appellant does talk to his mother.

52. HH  confirmed he did not know the appellant in Bangladesh. He  did  not
    know how far away their homes in Bangladesh were from  each  other  but
    thought it would take 3-4 hours to drive the distance.

53. HH said he did not have a proper bank account  but  a  monzo  card.  Mr
    Fakir was the only person  providing  him  with  support  by  sometimes
    giving him pocket money. If HH needed money he would tell Mr Fakir  and
    he would provide maybe ï¿½100 cash. The last time was around a month ago.



54. HH was shown the letter dated 18 December 2017 addressed to him at  the
    third address. He confirmed this was not the correct address for him at
    that time. He said he used to live there a long time  ago  but  had  no
    idea why they would write to him there, perhaps they had  found  it  on
    their system. He did not have any ID which could be  a  reason  why  he
    didn't change the address. When  he  got  his  ID  card  as  an  asylum
    applicant he changed the address. He got the card  after  he  made  the
    claim but he could not remember the date. HH then said he did have  the
    card at the date of the letter.

55. HH confirmed that between March and September 2015, HH was  in  Ireland
    because an agent took him there to claim asylum. He  did  not  maintain
    contact with the appellant during this time.

Mr Fakir

Written statement

56. Mr Fakir's statement states that he has known the appellant for  around
    three years, having (along with Mr Fakir's partner SR) met him  and  HH
    at GAY Late in Soho.  They later met up in many places  and  socialised
    together. They were delighted to  meet  a  gay  couple  from  the  same
    country as them and were fully aware of how difficult it is  being  gay
    in Bangladesh which is a Muslim country.

57. Mr Fakir and his partner SR recently obtained asylum in the UK as being
    a gay couple. Spending lots of time  together,  he  came  to  know  the
    appellant was suffering from severe depression. Mr  Fakir  states  that
    the situation for homosexuals in Bangladesh  is  life  threatening  and
    refers to incidents  of  violence  and  harassment  against  homosexual
    people.

Mr Fakir's oral evidence

58. Mr Fakir gave evidence through the Bengali interpreter. He confirmed he
    had been granted asylum status on the basis of his sexuality  in  2018.
    He made his claim in 2017, probably in January.

59. Mr Fakir has known Mr Brewis for around a year now  and  has  a  casual
    physical relationship  with  him.  Mr  Fakir's  relationship  with  the
    appellant and HH is a close one.

60. When Mr Fakir first met the appellant in 2017 he didn't know  that  the
    appellant had no basis to stay in the UK but came  to  know  when  they
    became close, roughly in 2017-2018. Mr Fakir told the appellant he  had
    claimed asylum only once it had been granted.  The  appellant  told  Mr
    Fakir the appellant had also applied after finding out  that  Mr  Fakir
    had been granted asylum. They did not discuss it before because "in the
    beginning it was not necessary to talk about these things",  they  were
    not good things to talk about. When Mr  Fakir  was  granted  asylum  he
    became brave enough to discuss it. After that they  discussed  it  more
    often and grew closer. Mr Fakir remembers telling the appellant and  HH
    that he had been granted asylum. Mr Fakir had a party where he rented a
    restaurant and provided food. His solicitors and three  or  four  other
    people were there however the appellant and HH were not there.  At  the
    time they were still new friends, it had not even been a year. When  Mr
    Fakir told them it was face to face and their  reaction  was  good  and
    they told Mr Fakir that they had also claimed.

61. Mr Fakir confirmed he works and sometimes supports the appellant and HH
    financially because they have problems and they are  good  friends.  He
    sometimes gives them money, last time was ï¿½100 probably last month.  Mr
    Fakir said when the appellant and HH had a visa they were able to  work
    and  earn  money.  He  didn't  know  if  anyone  else  supported   them
    financially. They had known Mr Brewis for around  a year but he  didn't
    know if Mr Brewis was helping them or not.

62. Mr Fakir confirmed that he, the appellant, HH  and  Mr  Brewis  met  up
    regularly (more so before  lockdown).  Mr  Fakir  did  not  go  to  the
    appellant and HH's house but they came to Mr  Fakir's  house,  although
    mostly they go to Mr Brewis's house.

63. Mr Fakir said it was perhaps not surprising that the appellant couldn't
    remember whether Mr Fakir had been granted asylum before or after  they
    met because the appellant was mentally not right, being  depressed  and
    coming to court three or four times.

Mr Brewis

Written statement

64. Mr Brewis confirmed he is a British national born  in  London,  retired
    and living a gay life. He is a close friend of the appellant and HH. He
    met them in November 2019 at She  World,  a  LGBT  club  in  Stratford,
    through their common friend Mr Fakir.

65. The appellant and HH frequently visit Mr Brewis's flat, at least once a
    month, and stay overnight most of the  time.  There  is  absolutely  no
    doubt that they are a sweet gay couple. As a gay man, Mr  Brewis  finds
    the appellant and HH are very loving and caring to each other. They are
    afraid of having to give up their gay life and would be  devastated  if
    they had to return to Bangladesh.

Mr Brewis's oral evidence

66. Mr Brewis gave his evidence in English. He described himself as  a  gay
    flamboyant man. He has a casual relationship with Mr Fakir,  they  have
    sex with each other. There used to be other men but  that  has  stopped
    due to Covid. The appellant and HH used to come and have a drink,  they
    stayed over sometimes and slept in the front room. Mr Brewis calls  the
    appellant 'Baboo'. Mr Brewis never visits them,  they  always  come  to
    him, it has always been that way. He doesn't travel to them.

67. When asked how he knows the appellant and HH are gay, Mr Brewis said he
    was claustrophobic so there are no doors in his house  other  than  the
    bathroom door. One night he got up  to  get  a  drink  and  heard  them
    kissing and cuddling as he walked past. He took no notice and went back
    to bed. When asked how he knew  they  were  kissing  and  cuddling,  Mr
    Brewis said "you know the noise", he did have a "little look" but  only
    slightly. They had the nightlight on and he saw  them  kissing  on  the
    lips. However, he knew before this that they were gay,  having  met  at
    She World. They became close friends because the appellant and HH  were
    friends with Mr Brewis's friend, Mr Fakir.

68. Mr Fakir has been Mr Brewis's friend and  occasional  partner  for  2-3
    years now. They never discussed when Mr Fakir was granted  asylum,  but
    he did know Mr Fakir had asylum. When asked why they didn't discuss it,
    Mr Brewis said there are some things in his  life  he  hadn't  told  Mr
    Fakir, the conversation just never came up.  Mr  Brewis  did  not  know
    anything about Mr Fakir's immigration status when they met, or that  he
    was Bangladeshi. Mr Brewis did ask what Mr Fakir was doing  in  the  UK
    and Mr Fakir said to get a job and a better life.

Written Statement of the  appellant's  parents  (neither  attended  to  give
evidence)

69. This statement confirmed that the appellant's parents currently live in
    India and are practising Hindus. They had to flee Bangladesh  to  India
    after their lives were threatened following the  appellant's  sexuality
    with a Muslim boyfriend being exposed  on  Facebook  in  October  2017.
    After this, many people in Bangladesh became  hostile  to  them.  Their
    house was vandalised and they were physically  assaulted  day  in,  day
    out. In the last few years they had been marginalised and under  threat
    for being  Hindu.  When  the  appellant's  sexuality  was  exposed  the
    hostility increased. Besides local extremist and fundamentalist groups,
    the brother of the appellant's previous partner,  RM,  used  his  local
    political  muscle  to  attack  them.  RM's  brother  had  always   been
    vindictive to the family as the appellant and  RM  were  caught  in  an
    intimate moment by RM's brother in April 2009.

70. They went to the police station to file  a  complaint  but  the  police
    threatened them too and informed RM's brother. Due to the threats  that
    ensued they had no option but to flee. The threats are of  killing  the
    appellant if he returns to Bangladesh.

71. The statement is accompanied  by  copies  of  the  parent's  ID  cards,
    confirmed as genuine by a notary in Bangladesh.

Witness statements of Mr Tezgel and Ms Oslem Sungurlu (neither  attended  to
give evidence)

72. Mr Tezgel is a friend of the appellant,  having  met  him  at  work  in
    January 2013. He found out about the appellants' homosexuality in 2013.
    They are still in regular contact. The appellant and HH regularly  meet
    up with Mr Tezgel and his girlfriend Ms Sungurlu. The  appellant  lives
    freely and openly as a gay man in the UK; he and HH make a  very  happy
    couple.

73. Ms Sungurlu has known the appellant since December 2017 having met  him
    through her boyfriend Mr Tezgel. The appellant and HH come  for  dinner
    regularly and they all spend time together hanging out.  The  appellant
    and HH are a sweet and loving couple. The appellant  lives  freely  and
    openly as a gay man in the UK.

The respondent's closing submissions

74. The respondent relied on the Refusal Letter  and  all  challenges  were
    maintained. It was not accepted that the appellant is a  gay  man,  nor
    his accounts of what  had  happened  in  Bangladesh  and  the  Facebook
    incident. Even with the new evidence adduced,  the  Presenting  Officer
    asserted that the appellant was not credible. There  seemed  to  be  an
    extraordinary lack of communication between the parties in relation  to
    Mr Fakir's grant of asylum and claim, for example the  appellant  could
    not even remember if Mr Fakir already had asylum in  2017.  Mr  Fakir's
    response was very evasive and inadequate. It  was  surprising  that  Mr
    Brewis did not know when Mr Fakir was granted asylum, in light of their
    statements referring to the terrible  situation  in  Bangladesh.  There
    were also different explanations given as to  the  different  addresses
    referred to for the appellant and HH.

75. The appellant's evidence in relation to his parents  was  extraordinary
    in saying that he continued to be supported only  by  his  mother  when
    both parents drafted a statement in support.

76. There was a discrepancy between the appellant and HH in relation to the
    legal advice they have sought. The appellant said they had spoken to  a
    legal advisor in relation to asylum and was told they may  get  limited
    leave whereas HH said no enquiry had been made.

77. The Presenting Officer appreciated both the appellant and HH  were  now
    here illegally and that it was a point relating to section 8 Asylum and
    Immigration (Treatment of  Claimants  etc)  Act  2004  that  they  both
    arrived on student visas, which they both went on to renew and  claimed
    asylum many years later. Not much can  be  said  about  what  they  are
    living on; they may be working illegally and not wish  to  say  so.  It
    seems implausible that they  have  been  living  on  basically  nothing
    except the odd handout for years.

The appellant's closing submissions

78. The appellant's' representative said there was no real  reason  in  the
    Refusal Letter to deem the appellant anything but credible and we would
    look in vain for clear inconsistencies. The only point  the  Presenting
    Officer has raised of substance is the pedantic one that Mr Brewis knew
    Mr Fakir had asylum but did not know when it had been granted.  However
    they are in a casual  sexual  relationship  and  it  is  a  stretch  to
    criticise him for his lack of knowledge.

79. As regards the addresses, this was adequality clarified. The  appellant
    explained there are apps and he gets emails. The GP has the old address
    which has not been changed but it is not a  point  that  the  claim  or
    credibility turns upon.  HH further explained that he did not  seek  to
    change the address until he was able to, having obtained his ID card.

80. In terms of legal advice, the appellant and HH had not even met at that
    stage.

81. As regards what they are living on, this is akin to  the  old  'Mr  and
    Mrs' television show where couples are asked questions about each other
    and it is funny when they are caught out. The point is that even people
    who know each other very well say different things. Overall, they  were
    actually very consistent in what they said, about the house being  rent
    free, the elderly landlord whom they  look  after  providing  food,  Mr
    Fakir  giving  them  cash  sometimes,  that  the  appellant  is  not  a
    practising Hindu and HH is not a practising Muslim, they met  in  2015,
    they moved to their current address in January 2020. They were  put  to
    the 'Mr and Mrs' test and were consistent.

82. As it is an asylum claim, it needs to be looked at through  the  'glass
    half full' lens  when  deciding  to  the  lower  standard  whether  the
    appellant is a gay man. We were invited to say  that  Mr  Fakir  was  a
    credible witness who has been recognised as a  gay  man.  There  is  no
    reason to deem him anything  other  than  credible.  In  terms  of  the
    appellant and HH's own credibility, they were consistent. They all said
    they go to Mr Brewis's house. He had seen them physically  intimate  in
    bed kissing. Is there a reasonable degree of likelihood that Mr  Brewis
    is telling the truth? Certainly to the lower standard. He turned up  to
    this Tribunal of his own volition. Therefore,  on  the  lower  standard
    clearly they are in gay relationship and the appellant is a gay man.

 The Law

 Asylum protection

83. Paragraph 334 of the Immigration Rules states that the  appellant  will
    be granted asylum if the provisions of that paragraph apply. The burden
    of proof rests on the appellant to satisfy us that he falls within  the
    definition  of  a  refugee  in  Regulation  2  of   the   Qualification
    Regulations, as read with Article 1(A) of the  Refugee  Convention.  In
    essence, the appellant has to show  that  that  there  are  substantial
    grounds for believing that he is outside his country of nationality  by
    reason of a well-founded fear of persecution for a  Refugee  Convention
    reason and is unable or unwilling, owing to such fear, to avail himself
    of the protection of that country.

84. When considering the appellant's general credibility in the context  of
    Paragraph 339 of the Immigration Rules and section 8 of the  2004  Act,
    we were conscious that section 8 was only an element to  be  considered
    in relation to the appellant's credibility and was not determinative.

85. We have noted the respondent's  asylum  policy  instruction  on  sexual
    orientation and asylum claims, version 6 dated 3 August 2016, pages  33
    to 34, which requires the respondent's officers  to  consider  possible
    reasons for  someone  not  disclosing  their  sexuality  at  the  first
    available opportunity,  for  example  because  of  feelings  of  shame;
    cultural implications; and painful memories. The  instruction  suggests
    that a failure to mention sexuality at the main  asylum  interview  may
    call into question the credibility of the claim, unless there are  good
    reasons for not having mentioned it, but that all  factors  had  to  be
    considered in the round.

ECHR

86. The burden of proof rests with the appellant to satisfy us  that  there
    are substantial  grounds  for  believing  that,  as  a  result  of  the
    respondent's decision, he will be exposed  to  a  real  risk  of  death
    contrary to Article 2 or serious harm in breach of  Article  3  of  the
    ECHR.

Findings of fact

87. We considered all of the evidence presented to us, whether we refer  to
    it specifically in these findings or not.

Events in Bangladesh

88. The Respondent says in the Refusal Letter that it was inconsistent that
    the appellant was not aware of the laws on being gay in Bangladesh.  We
    disagree. The appellant was seventeen at the time and, given  both  the
    appellant's and the country background evidence, being gay  was  not  a
    subject that would  necessarily  have  been  discussed  such  that  the
    appellant could have  been  expected  to  be  knowledgeable  about  the
    relevant law. It is also clear from the way the Asylum Interview Record
    question was phrased that  the  appellant  could  have  understood  the
    question to have been requesting details of the  specific  law,  rather
    than whether  homosexuality  was  illegal  in  general.  The  appellant
    confirms this was his view of the  question  in  paragraph  29  of  the
    detailed grounds of appeal.

89. We are conscious that in asylum claims there  is  often  little  or  no
    documentary evidence  to  support  the  appellant's  testimony.  It  is
    therefore perhaps understandable why there is no  documentary  evidence
    of the appellant's relationship with RM beyond the hospital  notes.  We
    cannot attribute much weight to those notes as, even translated they do
    not describe why the appellant was  in  hospital,  what  (if  any)  his
    injuries were and what treatment he  received.  But  beyond  this,  the
    respondent has not challenged events in Bangladesh  in  any  meaningful
    way and  the  statement  from  the  appellant's  parents  confirms  the
    appellant's  account  of  events  both  prior  and  subsequent  to  the
    appellant  leaving  Bangladesh.  Whilst  there  is  some  inconsistency
    between the appellant saying his  father  has  disowned  him,  and  his
    father signing a witness statement in his support, we do not find  this
    to be of much consequence in the claim as a whole. In the round and  to
    the lower standard, we find the appellant's account of his relationship
    in Bangladesh, the way it ended and his  reasons  for  leaving,  to  be
    credible.

Delay in claiming asylum

90. We have considered the appellant's general credibility in  the  context
    of paragraph 339 of the Immigration Rules and section  8  of  the  2004
    Act. In doing so, we were conscious that section 8 was only an  element
    to be considered in relation to the appellant's credibility and was not
    determinative. While the appellant did not claim asylum  on  the  basis
    that he was gay until 5 November 2017, being after he was  served  with
    notice of liability to removal on 11 August  2017  and  after  previous
    refusals  of  leave  to  remain  as  a  student,  we  considered   what
    explanations there might be for his delay  in  doing  so.  The  reasons
    provided, if truthful, would provide an explanation for  the  delay  in
    doing so. These were effectively that:

 a. the appellant was not aware that asylum could be claimed on  the  basis
    of sexuality

 b. the appellant did not want  to  contact  the  Home  Office  because  he
    understood them to have instructed Capita to catch and deport him

 c. the appellant had no reason to claim asylum until the Facebook incident
    in 2017 because prior to that he  had  leave  as  a  student  and  when
    further leave was refused, despite living here illegally, he was  in  a
    'good situation'

 d. the appellant had not sought legal advice in relation to his  sexuality
    prior to being in a relationship with HH, he  had  only  sought  it  in
    relation to his student visa

 e. it was only when he met Mr Fakir that he knew for certain  that  asylum
    could be claimed on grounds of sexuality

91. We find the first explanation to be fairly credible. The appellant  was
    very young in Bangladesh and only had one relationship  which,  if  the
    account is true (and we have found there to be a reasonable  degree  of
    likelihood that it was), ended in a traumatic way. The  appellant  fled
    and later took the easiest route  out  of  the  country,  being  via  a
    student visa which his family funded. At this stage the only people who
    knew about  his  sexuality  were  his  parents,  his  partner  and  his
    partner's elder brother, who had told the appellant's  parents  not  to
    tell anyone else. There was therefore no reason for the  appellant  not
    to use his own passport to leave the country. Having arrived in the  UK
    with leave, he had no reason to then claim asylum  straight  away.  His
    education may have been limited  by  the  initial  curtailment  of  his
    student  leave  and  subsequent  inability  to  attend  further  study.
    Although he attended gay nightclubs, he did not begin  attending  LGBTQ
    support networks until November 2017, which networks  might  have  been
    able to inform the appellant as to the options open to him.  Indeed  he
    may have found ELOP by searching for networks that  could  assist  with
    asylum claims based on sexuality, by 2017 having received legal  advice
    and met Mr Fakir (see below). On the other hand, his attendance at such
    networks coming after his claim for asylum could be seen as  a  cynical
    attempt to bolster his claim.

92. The second explanation is credible in light of the first (see paragraph
    90(b) above). When the appellant was refused further leave, if he truly
    did not know it was possible to  claim  asylum  on  the  basis  of  his
    sexuality, he would not have known to  do  so  and  in  fact  had  good
    reason, so he thought, for avoiding contact with the Home Office.

93. The third explanation is less credible in the sense that the  appellant
    had by this stage been living in the UK illegally for  over  two  years
    with another gay man. Although he says threats were  made  against  him
    and his family as a result of the Facebook incident  in  October  2017,
    there was nothing to suggest that the threat of deportation as a result
    of this incident had suddenly become more imminent, or that he would be
    tracked down in the UK by those making the threats. Rather, the fear of
    what would happen upon return markedly increased. We accept  that  with
    this increase in fear could have sparked the  need  to  legitimise  the
    appellant's ability to be in the UK to avoid the  risk  of  being  sent
    back to Bangladesh. However, this would necessarily be on the basis  of
    accepting the Facebook incident as not having been contrived.

94. We were very conscious of the Facebook incident  occurring  in  October
    2017 when the appellant had been served with a notice of  liability  to
    removal barely two months earlier. It is more realistic that  any  fear
    of being returned to Bangladesh was sparked by the removal notice which
    would have had definite consequences for  the  appellant  in  terms  of
    deportation rather than the Facebook incident which entailed none.

95. We therefore find the reason that the appellant claimed asylum when  he
    did was as a direct result of the notice of liability  to  removal  and
    not the Facebook incident. It is  not  possible  to  know  whether  the
    Facebook incident was contrived and although it goes to credibility  in
    terms of whether the appellant  is  willing  to  deceive  in  order  to
    bolster his claim, it is only one of the factors to  be  considered  in
    the round when assessing the core question of whether or not he is gay.
    There are several printouts from Facebook showing the  posts  from  the
    time, with unofficial translations of the  threats  that  followed.  We
    would note though that there is little  evidence  beyond  the  parent's
    statement to show that the post 'went viral' and reached a  significant
    number of people in Bangladesh.  We  do  not  know  how  many  Facebook
    'friends' the appellant had prior to the post or who these friends were
    and what their connections were. We do not know  what  the  appellant's
    privacy settings were in order to determine whether the post  was  only
    visible to 'friends' or the general public. However, it speaks  to  the
    credibility of the impact of the incident (whether  contrived  or  not)
    that the appellant's father was willing to sign a statement  confirming
    the effect of the Facebook incident on them, in that  it  led  to  them
    leaving Bangladesh, in circumstances  when  his  father  had  otherwise
    ceased all contact. It would be understandable that a  father  who  was
    ashamed of his son's behaviour would want his  son  to  appreciate  the
    negative impact it had also had on them.

96. The fourth explanation is more credible. Although it  is  unclear  when
    exactly legal advice was sought by the appellant and HH together, it is
    apparent that it was not before 2015.  The  appellant  said  he  didn't
    think about it when him and HH found each other  as  they  were  living
    well and were scared of the Home Office sending them back. HH said they
    discussed getting legal advice when they began living together,  having
    decided they could not return to Bangladesh as they would be killed.

97. The fifth explanation would potentially have been credible were it  not
    for the unclear answers given by both the appellant and  HH  concerning
    when exactly Mr Fakir told them (if he did) that he had claimed and was
    granted asylum, and when they told him they had claimed asylum. HH  was
    particularly evasive on this point. By all accounts the  appellant  and
    HH met Mr Fakir towards the end of 2017. The Facebook incident occurred
    in October 2017. It may be that the appellant and HH were reluctant  to
    clarify the timeline of events because they did not  want  it  to  look
    like they had made their claim up  bearing  in  mind  the  similarities
    between their claim and that of Mr Fakir i.e. they are homosexual, from
    Bangladesh and (for HH and Mr Fakir) Muslim. Or it  may  be  that  they
    have in fact 'borrowed' from Mr Fakir's own  claim.  We  do  not  know.
    Again, it is one of the factors to be  considered  in  the  round  when
    assessing the core question of whether or not he is gay.

98. We felt that Mr  Fakir  was  a  generally  credible  witness.  He  gave
    straightforward answers to questions without hesitation.   His  account
    of supporting the appellant  and  HH  financially  tallied  with  their
    accounts  and  he  also  confirmed  the  details  of  his   and   their
    relationship with Mr Brewis. Like the respondent, we found it  hard  to
    believe the appellant and HH had managed to survive for so long on  the
    occasional handout from Mr Fakir but this does not go to the core issue
    at stake.

99. In the round, we find the appellant's reasons for  not  seeking  asylum
    prior to November 2017 not to be credible. He knew he was gay prior  to
    coming to the UK. He knew he was under threat in Bangladesh; it is  why
    he left. Once his student visa application was refused he knew  he  was
    in the  UK  illegally.   After  October  2015  he  knew  he  was  in  a
    relationship with a gay man also from  Bangladesh  who  was  also  here
    illegally. They both attended gay  nightclubs  and  so  arguably,  even
    without formal membership of organisations such as  ELOP,  they  had  a
    network by which they could have become aware of the ability  to  claim
    asylum. Asylum is also something discussed regularly in  the  media  in
    the UK. The appellant had met his friend Mr Tezgel via work in 2013 and
    they discussed the appellant's situation, thereby  opening  up  another
    potential avenue for finding out about asylum. We do not know what  the
    work was or what access the appellant had to television,  internet  and
    other media within it, but he was out 'in the world' so  to  speak  and
    likely to be exposed to information. By his own account  he  also  used
    Facebook which carries information on and links to a range of  matters.



100. Having concluded that the appellant's reasons for not  claiming  asylum
    earlier are not credible, we are mindful that section 8 of the 2004 Act
    is merely a start of the assessment of the appellant's credibility  and
    that we have to consider all of the evidence round.

101. Despite not claiming asylum until late 2017, the appellant had  already
    been in a homosexual relationship  with  HH  for  two  years.  This  is
    corroborated by HH and Mr Tezgel whom he met in  2013.  If  the  lodger
    agreements are genuine they would also attest to the appellant  and  HH
    being in a relationship since October  2015.  However  it  is  hard  to
    attach much weight to these documents as they do not contain an address
    and  there  is  no  identification  or  other  documentation  from  the
    landlord. There are no other letters or  documents sent  to  the  first
    address from before October 2017. What we have  are  documents  showing
    different addresses for  each  of  the  appellant  and  HH.  They  both
    explained this as being due to them not having changed their  addresses
    at their respective GPs. However it is entirely unclear how HH received
    the letter dated  18  December  2017  from  'Partners  NHS  letter  for
    counselling', an entity separate from his GP, when it was  sent  to  an
    old address.

102. As to HH, we did not find him to be generally credible. He  was  vague,
    changeable and, at times, positively evasive when  questioned.  We  did
    not get to the bottom of how he  received  a  letter  sent  to  an  old
    address when he was supposed to be living with the appellant  elsewhere
    and we could not ascertain when he discussed asylum with Mr  Fakir.  He
    gave a different account to Mr Fakir of the celebrations that  followed
    Mr Fakir being granted asylum. We have seen no independent evidence  as
    to HH's account of happened to him  in  Bangladesh  and  it  does  seem
    questionable that he would have suffered the exact  same  fate  as  the
    appellant in terms of being 'caught in the act' and beaten  up.  It  is
    therefore difficult to attach much weight to his testimony. But the key
    issue in this claim is whether or not the appellant is gay, and whether
    or not he is in a relationship with  HH  goes  to  the  heart  of  that
    question.  Whilst  we  have  found  HH  himself  not  to  be  generally
    credible, the fact of his relationship with the appellant is  confirmed
    by other, credible, witnesses.

103.  Numerous  undated  photographs  appeared  in  the  appellant's  bundle
    showing the appellant and HH together, often kissing and touching  each
    other, sometimes partially clothed. There are other photographs of  the
    two of them with other people,  in  different  situations  and  wearing
    different clothes, both during the day and at night, and notably a  few
    feature Mr Brewis and Mr Fakir.  Without  explanations  of  what  these
    photos are intended to show and when and where they were taken,  it  is
    difficult to attach much weight to them overall but we accept that they
    do show the appellant and HH having affectionate physical contact  with
    each other on more than one occasion.

104. In addition to Mr Tezgel's statement (albeit we were  mindful  that  he
    did not attend to give evidence),  the  evidence  of  Mr  Brewis  is  a
    powerful indicator of the appellant and HH being in a gay  relationship
    and his evidence was not challenged by the Respondent.   Mr  Brewis  is
    independent from all concerned and had no reason to be  anything  other
    than truthful in saying he considered  the  appellant  to  be  gay  and
    having witnessed him and HH kissing. The fact that the appellant and HH
    had not mentioned, relied on, or even been aware that Mr Brewis had  so
    witnessed them in our view adds credence to his testimony. We found  Mr
    Brewis to be an honest and straightforward witness who was  very  clear
    about what he did and did not know about the appellant and HH.

105. In conclusion, in  assessing  the  appellant's  case  by  reference  to
    paragraph 339L of the Immigration Rules, on the one hand we  find  that
    the appellant did delay claiming asylum at  the  earliest  opportunity,
    and  noting  the  respondent's  guidance,  there  was   no   reasonable
    explanation for that delay, noting the gap between when  the  appellant
    was openly gay and when he eventually claimed asylum at least two years
    later in 2017 after receiving the removal notice. On the other hand  we
    find as compelling and certainly more than meeting the lower evidential
    burden of proof, the unchallenged evidence of Mr Brewis in  particular.
    Whilst HH was challenged as to  parts  of  his  evidence,  he  was  not
    challenged in any meaningful way on the core assertion that he was in a
    gay relationship with the appellant.

106. In summary and despite concerns around the  delay  in  the  appellant's
    claim of asylum we find that the appellant has established his  general
    credibility for the purposes of paragraph 339L and  that  the  evidence
    points to his being a gay man.

107. We find that the appellant is in a subsisting relationship with  HH  in
    light of the corroborating evidence from Mr Brewis and,  to  an  extent
    the appellant's parents. Mr Tezgel and Ms Sungurlu also attest  to  the
    relationship from the time when they each met the appellant and HH.

108. As stated the Respondent accepts that if the appellant is  gay  (as  we
    have found he is) he would live openly as a gay man and  would  have  a
    well-founded fear of persecution were he to be returned to Bangladesh.

Conclusions

Asylum

109. On the basis of our findings set out above,  we  have  found  that  the
    appellant does have a genuine  and  well-founded  fear  of  persecution
    based on being a gay  man  and  that  he  would  only  choose  to  live
    discreetly in Bangladesh because of fear of criminal prosecution,  were
    he to be returned to Bangladesh .

ECHR

110. Whilst the appellant  has  not  referred  us  to  evidence  as  to  the
    specific  individualised  risk  of  his  death  which  would  otherwise
    contravene article  2  (noting  that  there  had  been  gay  people  in
    Bangladesh who had been murdered, as referred to in  the  news  article
    produced and CPIN, but the evidence was not  clear  enough  as  to  the
    level of risk for gay people not acting as activists), we are satisfied
    that he would be at risk of serious harm in breach of article 3,  based
    on the deteriorating environment for members of  the  LGBTQ  community,
    noting the CPIN (Bangladesh: Sexual orientation and gender identity and
    expression) dated April 2020 and pages 233 -  322  of  the  appellant's
    supplemental bundle, which include the 2017 CPIN and articles referring
    to members of the LGBTQ community receiving threats and harassment  and
    suffering incidents of violence, including from members of the  police,
    and extremists.

111. In respect of the appellant's private life, we conclude  that,  despite
    the appellant  having  entered  and  remained  in  the  United  Kingdom
    unlawfully since 2010, there would  nevertheless  be  very  significant
    obstacles to his integration into Bangladesh. This  is  solely  on  the
    basis of his being gay. The fact that there are such  very  significant
    obstacles is a weighty consideration for the  purposes  of  his  appeal
    outside the Immigration Rules under article 8.

112. In short, in weighing up the appellant's claim under article 8, on  the
    one hand, there is a public aim  in  immigration  control.  Noting  the
    provisions of section 117B of the 2002 Act, we attach little weight  to
    such of the appellant's private life  developed  whilst  unlawfully  in
    United Kingdom.  On  the  other  hand,  the  appellant's  inability  to
    integrate into Bangladesh because of a well-founded fear of persecution
    and the risk of harm to him is an even weightier factor, and ultimately
    we  conclude  that  the  refusal  of  his  leave  to  remain  would  be
    disproportionate in the context of a claim under article 8.

Decision

113. The appellant's appeal on asylum grounds is upheld.

114. The appellant's appeal on humanitarian grounds is upheld.

115. The appellant's appeal on human rights grounds is  upheld  (articles  3
    and 8 but not 2).

Anonymity directions

As a result of this determination pursuant to Rule 13 of the Tribunal
Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Rules
2014, unless and until a tribunal or court directs otherwise, we have
ordered that the appellant and HH are granted anonymity. No report of these
proceedings shall directly or indirectly identify them or any member of
their families. This direction applies both to the appellant and to the
respondent. Failure to comply with this direction could lead to contempt of
court proceedings. The parties shall be at liberty to apply for discharge
of this order.

                            DECISION AND REASONS

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.



 1. These are a written record of the oral reasons given for my decision at
    the hearing.




 2. This is an appeal by  the  appellant  of  the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Courtney ("FtT") promulgated on 3 October 2019, by which
    she dismissed the appellant's appeal against the  respondent's  refusal
    on 15 May 2018 of his protection and human rights claims.


 3. In essence, the  appellant's  claims  involved  the  following  issues:
    whether, as a Bangladeshi national he  was  gay  and  had  had  both  a
    relationship in Bangladesh which, when discovered, had  led  him  being
    forced to flee; and had also had a  relationship, which was ongoing, in
    the UK.  The core points taken against the appellant by the  respondent
    related to asserted inconsistencies in whether the appellant had had  a
    relationship in Bangladesh;  his  claimed  fear  of  persecution  while
    asserting an ignorance in laws prohibiting homosexuality in Bangladesh;
    the fact that his documented evidence of gay club membership post-dated
    the appellant's protection claim; and the similarity  of  letters  from
    supporters.   In  addition,  the  respondent   did   not   accept   the
    authenticity or accuracy of hospital treatment said to corroborate ill-
    treatment in Bangladesh.




 4. The respondent further took issue with the  late  stage  at  which  the
    appellant  claimed  asylum,  referring  to  the  well-known   statutory
    provision of section 8 of the 2004 Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of
    Claimants, etc.) Act 2004, having arrived in the UK in 2010 and  having
    previous claims, on alternative bases rejected but only claiming asylum
    in 2017.


 5. In summary, the respondent did not accept that the appellant is gay.

The FtT's decision

6. The  FtT  was  not  impressed  by  various  aspects  of  the  appellant's
   evidence, finding that social media evidence had been circulated and seen
   by a limited number of  people  and  was  contrived  by  the  appellant's
   claimed partner. She did not accept the plausibility of  the  appellant's
   claim to have engaged in sexual acts in Bangladesh  when  family  members
   were in the same property ([36]); inconsistencies about the arm on  which
   the appellant claims to have slashed himself with his  partner's  initial
   (39]; she placed limited weight  on  a  tenancy  agreement  which  merely
   established potential cohabitation with a  claimed  partner  ([44]);  she
   placed limited weight  on  photographs  which  did  not  depict  physical
   contact between the appellant and his partner;  ([47]);  and  she  placed
   limited weight on membership cards for a gay club  which  post-dated  the
   appellant's claim.  The FtT was particularly  impressed  by  one  of  the
   witnesses who appeared to be evasive and when contradicting himself, then
   complained of headaches. A second witness who claimed to  have  witnessed
   the appellant and his partner kissing in front of them could  not  'save'
   the appellant's claim which in other respects, lacked credibility ([67]).
   The FtT also drew adverse inferences from the lateness of the appellant's
   asylum claim.

7. Having considered the evidence as a whole, the FtT did  not  accept  that
   the appellant is a gay man.

The grounds of appeal and grant of permission

8. The appellant lodged grounds of appeal which are  lengthy,  the  gist  of
   which were summarised  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Fisher,  granting
   permission on 14 November 2018, as  being  that  the  FtT  had  erred  in
   failing to consider the evidence  of  the  appellant's  partner  and  the
   second witness, whose honesty was not impugned.

9. The grant of permission was not limited in its scope.

The hearing before me

The appellant's initial submissions

10. Mr Murphy argued that it was not sufficient for the  FtT  to  rely  upon
   the authority of AB (Witness corroboration  in  asylum  appeals)  Somalia
   [2004] UKIAT 00125, for the proposition that an honest witness could  not
   'save' a weak case.  What was said here is that in  the  absence  of  any
   finding that the appellant's friend was not being truthful, the  FtT  had
   failed to explain why she did not accept the appellant's claim  to  be  a
   gay man, when a third party witness claimed to have seen the appellant in
   physical contact with  his  partner;  and  the  appellant's  partner  had
   attested in evidence, to the fact of their relationship.

The respondent's submissions

11. Mr Lindsay asserted that the FtT's decision  needed  to  be  read  as  a
   whole, which made clear that the FtT did not accept  that  the  appellant
   and his claimed partner  were  in  a  gay  relationship  and  there  were
   findings  on  various  aspects  of  all  of  the  evidence.   There   was
   specifically no requirement to refer to each and every piece of  evidence
   and  the  self-directions  on  the  evaluation  of  the   evidence   were
   unimpeachable.  The FtT  was entitled to rely on section 8  of  the  2004
   Act in relation to the lateness of the appellant's claim of  asylum;  the
   limited nature of any photographic evidence at paragraph  [47];  and  the
   fact that had the relationship been genuine there would  have  been  more
   evidence available.

The appellant's response

12. Mr Murphy argued that while other findings and analysis of the  evidence
   might be said to support the FtT's reasoning, that  avoided  the  central
   issue, to which there was answer, that the FtT had failed to explain  why
   she did not accept the evidence of the appellant's partner that they were
   in a gay relationship; or the evidence of a witness who  had  claimed  to
   have witnessed the appellant and his partner embracing and kissing.

Discussion and conclusions

13. I accept the force of Mr Murphy's argument that whilst the  concerns  on
   a number of aspects of the appellant's claim are ones which it  was  open
   to the FtT to consider, nevertheless there was a gap which  goes  to  the
   heart of this appeal, of whether and why  the  FtT  did  not  accept  the
   evidence of the appellant's partner that he was in  a  relationship  with
   the appellant.  This was despite it being apparent that the  partner  had
   given evidence in  cross-examination.   Whilst  the  FtT  criticised,  at
   paragraph [57], the posting by the claimed partner of material on  social
   media which was said to be contrived, nevertheless the FtT did not go  on
   to analyse the central issue of the partner's oral testimony  as  to  the
   genuineness of the relationship.

14. I also accept Mr Murphy's submission that in relation to a  witness  who
   had, as referred to at paragraph [66] of the decision,  claimed  to  have
   seen them hugging and kissing in front of him,  it  was  unexplained  why
   that evidence was not accepted or if it were accepted, how that was  then
   consistent with the finding that the appellant is not gay.

15. Where, as in this case, the credibility of the appellant is the  central
   issue in this case, I regard those  two  crucial  gaps  in  findings  and
   analysis as undermining the FtT's decision.  In the circumstances  it  is
   unsafe and cannot stand.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains an error of law, such  that
it must be set aside without any preserved findings of fact.

Disposal

16. With reference to paragraph  7.2  of  the  Senior  President's  Practice
   Statements and the narrowness of the  legal  issues,  I  regarded  it  as
   appropriate that the Upper Tribunal remakes the FtT's decision which  has
   been set aside.

Directions

17. The following directions shall apply  to  the  future  conduct  of  this
   appeal:

   a) The Resumed Hearing will be listed before Upper Tribunal Judge  Keith
      or any other Upper Tribunal Judge sitting at Field House on the first
      available date, time estimate 3 hours, to enable the  Upper  Tribunal
      to substitute a decision to either allow or dismiss the appeal.

   b) The appellant shall no later than 14 days before the Resumed  Hearing
      with  the  Upper   Tribunal   and   serve   upon   the   respondent's
      representative  a  consolidated,  indexed,   and   paginated   bundle
      containing all the documentary evidence  upon  which  he  intends  to
      rely. Witness statements in the bundle must  be  signed,  dated,  and
      contain a declaration of truth and shall stand  as  the  evidence  in
      chief of the maker who shall be made available for  the  purposes  of
      cross-examination and re-examination only.

   c) The respondent shall have leave, if so advised, to file  any  further
      documentation he  intends  to  rely  upon  and  in  response  to  the
      appellant's evidence; provided the same is filed no later than 7 days
      prior to the Resumed Hearing.

   d) The anonymity directions continue to apply.
