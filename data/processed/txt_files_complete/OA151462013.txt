For the Respondent:    Mr P Deller, Senior Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant appeals to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal dismissing his appeal against the  decision  by  an
    Entry Clearance Officer to refuse to issue her with entry clearance  as
    the spouse of a  person  present  and  settled  here.   The  First-tier
    Tribunal did not make an anonymity order, and I do  not  consider  that
    such an order is warranted for these proceedings in the Upper Tribunal.

 2. The appellant is a national of Sri Lanka, whose date  of  birth  is  26
    July 1984.  In her application form, she said she  had  first  met  her
    sponsor in person in July  2011  at  the  airport  in  Colombo.   Their
    relationship had begun on 20 June  2008,  and  had  been  conducted  by
    telephone and Skype since that date.  They had entered into an arranged
    marriage at St Mary's Cathedral in Colombo on 6  September  2011.   She
    and her sponsor  communicated  in  Tamil.   Her  sponsor  worked  as  a
    customer assistant for Tesco.   He  commenced  this  employment  on  25
    February  2012,  having  previously  worked  as  a  staff  member   for
    McDonald's Restaurants Limited.

 3. At paragraph 3.21 the appellant certified  that  her  sponsor's  annual
    income before tax from his current salaried employment met or  exceeded
    the financial requirement that she had to meet.

 4. On 27 June 2013 an Entry  Clearance  Officer  in  Chennai  refused  the
    appellant's  application,  as  she  had  not  provided  the   specified
    documents to show her sponsor's annual income from employment.  On  the
    evidence provided, her sponsor's gross income from his employment  with
    Tesco was �0 per annum.  This was because she had failed to  produce  a
    complete set of six months of  payslips  which  predated  the  date  of
    application by 28 days  or  less.   The  payslip  for  March  2013  was
    missing.  She had  also  not  provided  a  letter  from  her  sponsor's
    employer which satisfied the requirements of the Family Migration Rules
    as evidence of the sponsor's gross income from his employment.

The Hearing before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

 5. The appellant's appeal came  before  Judge  Mark  Eldridge  sitting  at
    Hatton Cross in the First-tier  Tribunal.   Although  the  sponsor  was
    present at the hearing, Mr Shaw informed the judge that he did not wish
    to call any evidence.  In his subsequent determination, Judge  Eldridge
    acknowledged that the appellant had now provided her husband's  payslip
    for the most recent month, namely March 2013.  She had thus  now  shown
    that her husband's total gross earnings were �8,847.50 over six months.
     This equated to an annual  figure  of  �17,695,  which  represented  a
    shortfall of �905.

 6. The judge went on to consider whether the shortfall could  be  made  up
    for by savings.   He  answered  this  question  in  the  negative.   He
    concluded at paragraph 18 as follows:

         The appellant has failed to show she can meet  the  requirement  of
         the Rules.  Even if the  missing  documents  could  be  overlooked,
         which they cannot, the income required is more than �900 short  and
         the savings inadequate.   The  appeal  must  fail.   The  appellant
         cannot meet the financial requirements of Appendix FM.

 7. The judge went on to address a submission from Mr Shaw that  he  should
    follow the decision of Blake J in MM, and find that the requirements of
    the Rules are excessive and a figure of �13,500 or  thereabouts  should
    be applied.  Judge Eldridge rejected this submission.  He  went  on  to
    address Article 8 in paragraph 20:

         Article 8 was never a ground in this appeal - either in the  appeal
         notice or at the hearing.  For the sake of completeness I am  bound
         to say  that,  even  if  it  had  been,  I  would  have  found  the
         respondent's decision proportionate.  The economic interests of the
         country are at the heart of the Rules  and  the  justification  for
         them.   I  would  not  have  found  there   were   the   compelling
         circumstances envisaged by Sales J in his decision  in  R  (On  the
         application of Nagre) v Secretary of State for the Home  Department
         [2013] EWH 720  (Admin)  as  justifying  consideration  beyond  the
         Rules.  As it is that is not a matter I have to consider.

The Application for Permission to Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

 8. Mr Shaw settled the appellant's application for permission to appeal to
    the Upper Tribunal, arguing that the judge had been wrong to reject  MM
    by reference to Gulshan (Article 8 -  new  Rules  -  correct  approach)
    [2013] UKUT 640.  Although MM was mentioned  in  Gulshan,  it  was  not
    overruled and remained the law.  Mr  Shaw  also  took  issue  with  the
    judge's statement in paragraph [20] that Article 8 was never  a  ground
    of appeal.  He had expressly pleaded in his  skeleton  argument  before
    the First-tier Tribunal that refusal of  the  application  would  be  a
    disproportionate breach of the appellant's and her husband's  right  to
    family life.

The Grant of Permission to Appeal

 9. On 30 June 2014 First-tier Tribunal Judge Page  granted  the  appellant
    permission to appeal on Article 8 grounds, holding that all grounds  of
    appeal under Article 8 were arguable.

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

10. At the hearing before me, Mr Deller produced the decision of the  Court
    of Appeal in MM (Lebanon) and others v Secretary of State for the  Home
    Department [2014] EWCA Civ 985, which overturns the decision of Blake J
    relied on by Mr Shaw before the First-tier Tribunal.  I  adjourned  the
    hearing  so  as  to  give  Mr  Shaw  an  opportunity  to  consider  the
    ramifications of the Court of Appeal decision.  On  the  resumption  of
    the hearing, Mr Shaw acknowledged that one of the key points he  relied
    upon below fell away.  He no longer submitted  that  the  judge  should
    have found the sponsor's income to be adequate,  by  reference  to  the
    "lower appropriate figure" of around �13,500 championed by Blake  J  in
    MM.  But he submitted it was still the case that it  was  open  to  the
    court to find that a refusal on financial grounds was disproportionate.
     The sponsor's income  still  fell  below  the  required  threshold  of
    �18,600.  It was not known when the sponsor's earnings would meet  that
    threshold.

Discussion

11. The judge appears to have been in error insofar as he held that Article
    8 had not been raised at the hearing.  But the error was not  material,
    as the judge nonetheless addressed the precise point raised by Mr  Shaw
    in his skeleton argument, which was the proportionality of the refusal.
    He not only went on to address it in paragraph [20], but he had already
    engaged with the  arguments  which  underpinned  the  Article  8  claim
    earlier in his determination: namely, the "near-miss" argument and  the
    reliance  on  MM.  I  consider  that  the  judge's   determination   is
    impeccable, and I can find no fault whatsoever in his reasoning.

12. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Page said it was arguable  that
    the judge should have allowed the appeal under Article 8 because  there
    was only a shortfall of �905 in the  required  income  of  �18,600.   I
    disagree.  It was not open to the  judge  to  allow  the  appeal  under
    Article 8 simply because the husband failed to meet the required income
    threshold by only a small margin.

13. As the judge rightly directed himself in paragraph [20], he could  only
    allow the appeal under Article 8 if the high threshold test set out  by
    Sales J in Nagre, and endorsed by the Upper Tribunal  in  Gulshan,  was
    met.  There was no evidence that there were insurmountable obstacles to
    family life being conducted by the couple in Sri Lanka,  and  that  was
    not part of the appellant's case.  In  the  absence  of  insurmountable
    obstacles to family life being carried on in  Sri  Lanka,  there  would
    have to have been compelling circumstances not sufficiently  recognised
    by the Immigration Rules to justify a grant of entry clearance  to  the
    appellant outside the Rules.

14. It was open to the judge to find that there were  not  such  compelling
    circumstances on the evidence that was before him.  The only compelling
    circumstance specifically relied on in support of the Article  8  claim
    was the near miss under the  Rules,  and  that  did  not  constitute  a
    compelling circumstance.

15. It was not the appellant's case before the First-tier Tribunal that her
    husband would not be able to meet the financial  threshold  of  �18,600
    for the foreseeable future.  But even if it had been, the  judge  could
    only consider the circumstances appertaining at the date of the refusal
    decision in his Article 8 assessment.

16. The only other relevant evidence bearing  upon  the  assessment  of  an
    Article 8 claim outside the Rules  was  a  letter  in  the  appellant's
    bundle from the appellant's church  in  Sri  Lanka  testifying  to  the
    appellant's upset at not being granted  entry  clearance  to  join  her
    husband in the UK.  But the appellant's upset  did  not  constitute  an
    exceptional  or  compelling  circumstance.  On  the  face  of  it,  the
    interference consequential upon the lawful refusal  decision  was  only
    temporary in that it  was  open  to  the  appellant  to  make  a  fresh
    application, relying on more up-to-date evidence of annual earnings. So
    there was no error on  the  part  of  the  judge  in  not  specifically
    addressing this piece of evidence  as  part  of  his  discussion  of  a
    putative Article 8 claim.

Decision

17. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal does not contain  an  error  of
    law, and accordingly the decision stands.  This  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal is dismissed.
