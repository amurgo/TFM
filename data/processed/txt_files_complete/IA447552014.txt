Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms Vatich, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr T Wilding, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born  on  1st  July  1935.   The
    Appellant was last admitted to the United Kingdom on 9th May 2011 on  a
    visit visa until 10th October 2011.   She  applied  for  further  leave
    which was granted until 14th August 2014.   On  12th  August  2014  the
    Appellant applied for  a  residence  card.   On  21st  October  2014  a
    decision was made to refuse to issue a residence card  as  confirmation
    of a right of residence under European Community law as  the  dependent
    family member of an EEA national exercising treaty rights in the United
    Kingdom.

 2. The Appellant appealed and the appeal came before Judge of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Baldwin sitting at Richmond on 17th August  2015.   In  a
    decision and reasons promulgated on 25th August  2014  the  Appellant's
    appeal under the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006 was dismissed.

 3. On 8th September 2015 the Appellant lodged Grounds  of  Appeal  to  the
    Upper Tribunal.  Those grounds were considered by Judge of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Osborne on 7th January 2016.  The grounds  asserted  that
    the judge had recorded that the Appellant's evidence  was  inconsistent
    with that of the Sponsor.  They contended that  the  Appellant  clearly
    did not understand the question that was put to her upon the  issue  of
    money received.  The Sponsor had provided his pay slips to confirm that
    he was exercising his treaty rights in the UK.  The  judge  found  that
    the bank statements did not correspond with the pay slips but the judge
    did not consider that the pay slips clearly stated that the Sponsor was
    given cash in hand and that this  money  was  being  deposited  in  the
    Sponsor's bank account which was clearly labelled as Giro  Credit.   It
    was contended that the judge made a material error of law and had taken
    into account that the Sponsor's wages were  being  transferred  by  the
    employer which was incorrect and that the  judge  had  found  that  the
    Appellant and the Sponsor did not live together upon the basis that the
    Appellant stated she lived  at  a  different  address.   Judge  Osborne
    considered that that again was a misunderstanding by the Appellant  who
    had stated in oral evidence that she lived near a mosque  and  did  not
    know the exact name of the road.   He  considered  that  the  Appellant
    might have misunderstood the question and  that  it  was  possible  the
    judge had erred by failing to give sufficient weight to the documentary
    evidence.  Further Judge Osborne considered that it was  arguable  that
    the judge had erred in law in failing to  consider  Article  8  of  the
    European Convention of Human Rights.

 4. On 11th January 2016 the Secretary of State responded to the Grounds of
    Appeal pursuant to Rule 24.  The  Respondent  opposed  the  Appellant's
    appeal and submitted that the Judge of the First-tier Tribunal directed
    herself appropriately.  The Secretary of State contended that the issue
    of the pay slips and bank  statements  not  tallying  was  one  of  the
    reasons given by the judge for rejecting  the  evidence  and  that  the
    judge's findings were sound.  Furthermore any  error  with  respect  to
    this was not material as clearly the Appellant  could  not  demonstrate
    prior dependency or prior membership of the EEA national household.  As
    this was an EEA application with no removal directions  the  judge  was
    correct not to consider Article 8.

 5. It is important to consider what happened thereafter at this  stage  so
    as to fully set out the position  as  it  ultimately  came  before  me.
    Thereafter the case appeared for consideration  by  way  of  directions
    following the decision in TY (Sri Lanka) [2015] EWCA Civ 1233.  I  made
    a direction that leave to the Appellant's representatives be granted to
    provide written reasons as to why the appeal on the issue  pursuant  to
    Article 8 should not be dismissed  and  directed  that  the  matter  be
    listed for hearing on the first available date.  That hearing came back
    before me on 17th June 2016.  Ms Vatich was in attendance on behalf  of
    the Appellant.  At that hearing the Home Office Presenting Officer  was
    Mr Norton.  I gave directions

      i) that it was recorded that the issue as to  whether  the  judge  had
         materially erred in law in his decision of 17th  August  under  the
         Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006 remained to be  determined;  and



     ii) list the matter for hearing for  error  of  law  before  any  Upper
         Tribunal  Judge  or  Deputy  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  on  the  first
         available date 28 days hence.

 6. Thereafter the matter came to be considered  by  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    Perkins acting as Duty  Judge  when  it  was  contended  by  the  legal
    representatives that I had made a finding that  there  was  a  material
    error of law in the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge.   The
    file was redirected back to me.  I took the opportunity  to  listen  in
    depth to the transcript of  the  hearing  which  fortunately  had  been
    recorded.  Two facts were clear.  Firstly I had erred in referring  the
    matter to any  Upper  Tribunal  or  Deputy  Upper  Tribunal  Judge.   I
    specifically reserved the matter to myself.  Secondly, however,  I  had
    made it clear on more than one occasion during the hearing that  I  had
    made no finding as to whether there was or was not a material error  of
    law in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  under  the  2006
    Regulations.  That matter remained extant for  hearing.   That  clearly
    was the case as I had heard no evidence nor submissions.  What had been
    conceded was that following TY (Sri Lanka) there was no  extant  appeal
    that could proceed under Article 8.

 7. It was on that basis that I arranged for the matter to be  relisted  at
    the first available date for hearing before me and  I  gave  directions
    that all parties should attend albeit that the initial  aspect  of  any
    appeal would be as to whether or not there was a material error of  law
    in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge and indeed if I found
    that there  was  not  then  there  would  be  no  further  evidence  or
    submissions before me.

 8. It was on that basis the matter was relisted for hearing before  me  on
    26th August 2016.  The Appellant and her Sponsor appeared.   Ms  Vatich
    who by now was familiar with this matter appeared again  on  behalf  of
    the Appellant.  On this occasion the Secretary of State was represented
    by her Home Office Presenting Officer Mr Wilding.

Submissions on Error of Law

 9. Ms Vatich made brief submissions, pointing out that the  Sponsor  is  a
    taxi driver who works in a cash society and that it is  cash  that  was
    transferred on his behalf for the benefit of the Appellant in  Pakistan
    and that the only evidence available was  that  of  the  parties.   She
    acknowledged that the pay slips provided did not  show  cash  transfers
    but that there was evidence that the Sponsor was being paid in cash and
    that the giros  and  bank  statements  showed  there  was  evidence  of
    financial dependency.  Further she submits that  the  judge  failed  to
    make any findings on documents produced, including a  letter  from  the
    taxi  company,  the  Sponsor's  motor  insurance  documents,  his  taxi
    licence, pay slips, and bank statements, all of which she submits  show
    that he was a qualified person within the UK and  that  by  failing  to
    make findings on these documents the judge had materially erred in law.



10. Mr Wilding submitted that there was  a  bundle  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  He is unaware what additional documents were put in and that
    the evidence does not refer to other documents.  He submits however  it
    is difficult to see how a  certificate  of  insurance  would  establish
    anything other than the fact that the Appellant was a taxi  driver  and
    does not show that he is actually earning money.

11. He takes me to paragraph 19 of the decision, contending that  it  shows
    clearly that the pay slip and bank statement  evidence  provided  could
    refer to other evidence and that the judge was entitled  to  find  that
    she was not satisfied that the Sponsor had been paid  as  claimed.   He
    submitted that it was as a matter of law not sufficient for the Sponsor
    to be a  qualified  person  and  that  there  must  be  an  element  of
    dependency by the Appellant.  He submits that  the  grounds  amount  to
    little more than disagreement and that there is no evidence  that  this
    point was not understood by the  Sponsor  or  Appellant  and  that  the
    findings were open to the judge on the findings that were  before  her.



The Law

12.  Areas  of  legislative  interpretation,  failure  to  follow   binding
    authority or to distinguish it with adequate reasons, ignoring material
    considerations  by  taking  into  account  immaterial   considerations,
    reaching irrational conclusions  on  fact  or  evaluation  or  to  give
    legally inadequate reasons for the decision and procedural  unfairness,
    constitute errors of law.

13. It is not an arguable error of law for an Immigration Judge to give too
    little weight or too much weight to a factor, unless  irrationality  is
    alleged.  Nor is it an error of law for an Immigration Judge to fail to
    deal with every  factual  issue  of  argument.   Disagreement  with  an
    Immigration Judge's factual conclusion, his appraisal of  the  evidence
    or assessment of credibility, or his evaluation of risk does  not  give
    rise to an error of law.  Unless an Immigration Judge's  assessment  of
    proportionality is arguable as being  completely  wrong,  there  is  no
    error of law, nor is it an error of law for an Immigration Judge not to
    have regard to evidence of events arising after his decision or for him
    to have taken  no  account  of  evidence  which  was  not  before  him.
    Rationality is a very high threshold and a conclusion is not irrational
    just because some alternative explanation has been rejected or  can  be
    said to be possible.  Nor is it necessary to  consider  every  possible
    alternative  inference  consistent   with   truthfulness   because   an
    Immigration Judge concludes that the story is untrue.  If  a  point  of
    evidence of significance has been ignored or misunderstood, that  is  a
    failure to take into account a material consideration.

Findings on Error of Law

14. It is difficult to  put  myself  in  the  position  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge because it remains unclear as to exactly what  documents
    were before the First-tier Tribunal and what was not.   Ms  Vatich  had
    the benefit of being present.  She refers  me  to  documents  which  do
    include pay slips and bank statements that are not referred to  by  the
    First-tier  Tribunal  Judge.   Whilst  acknowledging  that  it  is  not
    incumbent upon a judge to refer to every document, bearing in mind  the
    submissions that are made, namely that the Sponsor has provided his pay
    slips to confirm he is exercising his treaty rights,  the  Sponsor  was
    employed as  claimed  and  that  the  Appellant  has  been  financially
    dependent on the Sponsor when in Pakistan, when looked at alongside the
    failure of the First-tier Tribunal Judge to refer to all  documents,  I
    consider the correct approach in the interest of  justice  is  to  find
    that there were material errors of law as a result of  the  failure  to
    consider those documents or at least to refer to them, and to set aside
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal and to proceed  to  rehear  the
    matter.

The Rehearing

15. The matter proceeds  to  rehearing  today  with  the  consent  of  both
    parties.  Both indicate they are ready to proceed and there is  nothing
    to be gained by having a further adjournment.  Both sides indicate they
    would wish me to determine the outstanding issue on the rehearing.  The
    Appellant attends and gives her name.  She does not know  her  address.
    She acknowledges she lives with her son.  The  Sponsor  indicates  that
    she does believe that a witness statement was made but  it  is  pointed
    out that that witness statement is undated  and  unsigned.   She  would
    wish to rely on it as her evidence-in-chief but she cannot confirm that
    she ever did sign it or  that  it  was  signed  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  Certainly nobody attending  before  me  appears  to  have  a
    signed copy.  It is clear that the witness statement  was  provided  by
    instructed solicitors.  She states  that  her  son,  i.e.  the  Sponsor
    supports her financially and that he did so in Pakistan and in  the  UK
    and that she lives with him.  She further states within that  statement
    that she has no one to return to in Pakistan and that  she  is  elderly
    and unable to return to Pakistan on her own.  She points out  that  she
    was previously dependent upon another son in Pakistan who died in 2009.



16. Under cross-examination from Mr Wilding the  Appellant  states  she  is
    financially dependent upon her sons because she cannot depend upon  her
    daughters.  It is pointed out to her that when she entered the  UK  she
    said she was dependent upon her  daughter  and  not  her  son  and  she
    replies that that was because she was attending her daughter's  wedding
    and since then she has been dependent upon her son and that there is no
    one else to support her.

17. The Appellant's Sponsor then attended to give evidence.  Her Sponsor is
    her son Mr Mohammed Farooq Malik.  He produced further  documents  upon
    which he sought to rely.  These consisted of:-

       . A letter from his accountants dated 9th February 2016 stating  that
         he should be in a position to comfortably afford the monthly rental
         with relevant bills and deposit on the flat he wished to rent.

       . A letter from his accountants giving  details  of  the  Appellant's
         self-employment as a minicab driver.

       .  His  Transport  for  London  taxi  licence  dated  January   2016.



       . Temporary permit enabling him to drive dated 2004.

       . His car insurance details.

       . Details of his badge issued by Transport for London, it expires  in
         2017.

    In addition he relies on a P45  dated  22nd  December  2015  from  B  M
    Chauffeurs Limited stating that at the relevant period he  was  earning
    �3,943.50 per annum.  No accounts have been produced.  He advises  that
    he is paid in cash.  That constitutes the  totality  of  the  Sponsor's
    evidence.

18. Under cross-examination from Mr  Wilding  the  Sponsor  is  asked  that
    although he now states he is paid cash,  was  that  the  case  when  he
    worked for B M  Chauffeurs  Limited.   The  Sponsor  states  that  some
    payment was made to him by cheque.   He  is  asked  as  to  whether  he
    accepts he stopped working for B M Chauffeurs Limited in November  2015
    and he agrees.  He acknowledges he has not produced  any  accounts  for
    2016 or bank  statements  for  the  present  year  and  that  the  only
    statements produced are his 2014 statements from  Barclays  PLC.   When
    asked as to how he pays for his gas and electricity he states that they
    are included with his rent which he pays by cash in the sum  of  �1,200
    per month.  He is referred by Mr Wilding to the bank accounts for  June
    and July and Mr Wilding takes him to those bank statements and is asked
    as to where within them is there anywhere to be  found  an  amount  has
    been taken to pay rent.  Significantly, the Sponsor is unable to  reply
    to this question.

19. Mr Wilding inquires as to his family in the UK and he states he has one
    brother and two sisters, that he sees them occasionally.

20. Under re-examination the Sponsor is still unable to advise as to why he
    has not produced a tax return, but points out that his family  consists
    of, two sisters and a brother in the UK, a further brother in  Pakistan
    and one in Italy.

21. The Appellant further relied on the evidence of Tasneem Noor Malik  who
    is the Appellant's daughter.   She  confirms  and  adopts  her  witness
    statement of 26th August 2016 advising she has never provided financial
    support to the Appellant, but that she was  the  person  who  sent  the
    invitation in support of the Appellant's visit visa  application.   She
    contends that her mother was financially supported by the Sponsor  when
    in Pakistan and since her arrival in the UK.  She is at pains to  point
    out that it is the Sponsor and not her who supports the Appellant.

22. On  cross-examination  by  Mr  Wilding  Miss  Malik  states  she  is  a
    receptionist at a GP practice and  that  the  Sponsor  is  the  closest
    person to the Appellant and financially dependent upon him.

Submissions

23. Ms Vatich asked me to  find  the  Sponsor  a  credible  and  consistent
    witness and contends that the Appellant has always been dependent  upon
    the Sponsor.  Ms Vatich acknowledges that the Appellant came to the  UK
    for her daughter's wedding but that is the  extent  of  the  dependency
    upon the daughter and that  the  main  responsibility  falls  upon  the
    Sponsor.  She contends that there is  no  limit  available  as  to  the
    Sponsor's earnings because he is paid  in  cash  but  that  only  small
    amounts are needed and submits that the  Appellant  has  satisfied  the
    Regulations by being dependent upon the Sponsor both  in  Pakistan  and
    the UK and because he is a qualified person.  She asked me to allow the
    appeal.

24. Mr Wilding submits that there is no evidence (or at best looking in the
    Appellant's favour a complete lack of it) as to the Sponsor's status as
    a qualified person.  He points out it is notable that no  evidence  has
    been provided as at today's date with regard to this and that there  is
    no evidence relating to the Sponsor's income and that he  has  produced
    no tax returns despite knowing that he had to do so.  He  submits  that
    in such circumstances it is impossible for Mr Malik to show that he  is
    a qualified person and for his appeal to succeed.  He submits the  only
    evidence is his oral testimony that he  is  working  and  he  gives  no
    evidence as to how much work he does or of his income  and  to  use  Mr
    Wilding's words "the appeal does not even get  off  the  ground.".   He
    submits that the position has not changed at all from that  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal and that the evidence shows that  the  findings  of
    the First-tier Tribunal Judge were correct.

25. He submits that it is unclear even now as to how the Sponsor was  paid;
    that there is no evidence as to his bank giros or  transfers  and  that
    the evidence only provided from employers relates to  pay  slips  which
    are wholly incomplete and fail to show that the Sponsor was a qualified
    person.  He points out that there is a  knock  on  effect  consequently
    relating to the submission that there is a dependency by the  Appellant
    and that the Tribunal has no idea of the level of dependency.   All  we
    do know he submits is that in real life there  is  an  acceptance  that
    children help out and on the balance of probabilities he  submits  that
    the Appellant is dependent upon all children and not the  Sponsor.   He
    submits that the evidence would have to be far more compelling for  the
    appeal to succeed and that dependency is not one of choice and he asked
    me to dismiss the appeal under the Regulations.

26. In brief response Ms Vatich points out that the Appellant has  a  multi
    visa and that she stayed on in the UK after the death  of  her  son  in
    Pakistan.  She contends that  there  is  substantial  evidence  of  the
    Sponsor being qualified and reminds me that there  is  no  limit  to  a
    qualified person's earnings.

Findings

27. I reminded myself of the  relevant  law.   The  Sponsor  is  a  Belgian
    national who appears to be exercising his treaty rights working in  the
    UK.  The basis upon which the Sponsor can become a qualified person  is
    set out at paragraph 6 of the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006 and  I
    can give due consideration to this  paragraph.   The  Appellant  states
    that she is a direct family member pursuant to paragraph 7(i)(c) of the
    2006 Regulations.  I accept that she is a family member.  It is however
    necessary for her to show that she is a dependent direct relative.   As
    was quite properly identified by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  the
    burden of proof is on the Appellant and the standard of  proof  is  the
    balance of probabilities.

28. It is  difficult  not  to  express  an  element  of  sympathy  for  the
    Appellant.  She is an elderly lady.  She appears, with due  respect  to
    her, to be completely clueless  to  these  proceedings.   She  has  not
    signed a witness  statement  for  the  hearing  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.   Her  instructing  solicitors  have  not  remade  a  witness
    statement nor has she apparently ever gone through the evidence that is
    required.  Despite having been in this country  now  for  a  number  of
    years she does not know the address  at  which  she  lives  and  merely
    states that it is her son  who  supports  her.   It  is  not  disputed,
    firstly, that another son, who clearly provided support, passed away in
    2009 nor, secondly, is it seemingly disputed that there  is  a  further
    son living in Pakistan.  Mr Wilding generously gave the  Appellant  the
    benefit of the doubt  in  not  challenging  too  strongly  her  witness
    statement albeit that it was unsigned.  But even  at  the  hearing  the
    Appellant was unable to confirm its truth.

29. Consequently the burden falls on  the  Sponsor.   It  is  difficult  to
    conceive of a worse prepared case and a complete lack  of  evidence  to
    show that the Sponsor meets the Regulations and that the  Appellant  is
    dependent upon him.  I gave the Appellant the benefit of the doubt that
    the  judge  having  failed  to  refer  to  certain  documents   (listed
    previously) may not have been given due consideration to  the  entirety
    of the evidence and consequently materially erred in law.  When  looked
    at in the round and looked at alongside  the  additional  documentation
    provided by the Sponsor it is difficult to see how any further  support
    to  the  contentions  made   by   the   Sponsor   through   his   legal
    representatives that he is a qualified person supporting his mother  as
    his dependant and thereby meeting the requirements  of  the  Rules  has
    been shown on a balance of probabilities.  Ms Vatich in her submissions
    asked me to find that the Sponsor has been credible and consistent.   I
    find that he has lacked credibility in just about  every  part  of  his
    evidence.  His only consistency has been  in  his  failure  to  provide
    proper supportive and documentary evidence.  It is  very  difficult  to
    know what the Sponsor does in the UK.  He claims to  have  earnings  in
    the region of �3,900 per annum.  He claims to work as a taxi driver  on
    a cash basis.  There are no receipts.  There are no accounts.  There is
    no documentary evidence as to how he  pays  his  rent  and  importantly
    there is a complete  lack  of  documentary  evidence  showing  that  he
    supports his mother and that she is dependent upon him.

30. It is the submission  of  Mr  Wilding  that  the  Appellant  is  almost
    certainly dependent upon all of her children albeit that  there  is  no
    evidence to that effect before me, but he contends  that  that  is  the
    only conclusion that can be reached bearing in mind that  there  is  no
    documentary evidence available.  The Sponsor's oral testimony was quite
    simply lacking in any form of consistency or credibility.  The lack  of
    evidence he has failed to provide to show that he is a qualified person
    and that there is a dependency provided by his  financial  position  is
    stark.  Even knowing what the outstanding issues were  and  bearing  in
    mind that it was always possible that this matter  was  to  proceed  to
    rehearing, the failure of  the  Appellant's  instructed  solicitors  to
    produce documentary evidence or reason for lack of it is telling.  That
    may not be a failing of the solicitors.   Having  had  the  benefit  of
    listening to evidence orally from the Sponsor it may well be that he is
    completely incapable of providing that documentation.   It  is  however
    for the Sponsor/Appellant to discharge the burden of proof.

31. Even looking at the matter afresh  and  taking  into  account  all  the
    evidence that is now before me,  the  only  evidence  that  is  of  any
    consequence or remotely credible  is  the  oral  testimony  of  Tasneem
    Malik.  That in itself does not discharge the  burden  of  proof.   The
    findings made by the First-tier Tribunal Judge  at  paragraph  19  with
    regard to the provision of pay slips have not been  further  clarified.
    The position  regarding  accommodation  has  not  been  taken  further.
    Importantly the evidence endorsed the view on a rehearing, as described
    at paragraph 21 in the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge's  decision,  namely
    there has been a failure to provide  credible  evidence  and  that  the
    findings are such that the Appellant has failed to discharge the burden
    of proof under the 2006 Regulations and the  appeal  must  consequently
    therefore be dismissed.

32. I add a caveat paragraph.  There are two issues within this appeal that
    cause me concern.  The first relates to the  position  of  the  Sponsor
    within the UK bearing in mind his quite glaring lack of credibility and
    his failure to show that  he  is  a  qualified  person  under  the  EEA
    Regulations and secondly I have seen the Appellant.  She is clearly  an
    elderly and frail lady.  Whether as a matter of  fact  it  is  remotely
    conceivable that she can return to Pakistan is a matter for others  and
    not for this Tribunal.

Notice of Decision

33. For all the reasons given above this is an Appellant who as a matter of
    law does not satisfy the  requirements  of  the  Immigration  (European
    Economic Area) Regulations 2006 and the appeal is dismissed.

34. No anonymity direction is made.
