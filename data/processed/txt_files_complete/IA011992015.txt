For the Respondent:    No appearance by the Appellant (who was
unrepresented)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. This is an appeal by the Appellant hereinafter called the Secretary of
      State against a decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Herbert OBE  who
      sitting at Hendon Magistrates' Court  on  6  January  2016  and  in  a
      decision subsequently promulgated on  12  January  2016,  allowed  the
      appeal of the Respondent (hereinafter called the Claimant)  a  citizen
      of France born  on  2  November  1991  against  the  decision  of  the
      Secretary of State dated 24 November 2014 to make a deportation  order
      by virtue of Section 5(1) of the Immigration Act 1971.


   2. The immigration history of the Claimant as set out by the Secretary of
      State in her ICD3237 is as follows:

         "There is no record  of  the  Claimant's  entry  into  the  United
         Kingdom.  The Claimant stated that he arrived in the United Kingdom
         in 1995.  According to Home Office records  on  25  May  2000,  the
         Claimant was granted  a  residence  permit  for  five  years  as  a
         dependant of his father, Mr Sylvian Yaba.  On 21 June 2005  he  was
         granted indefinite leave to remain as a dependant of  his  father's
         application.  His mother and sibling were also granted in line.


         On 1 February 2011, the Claimant  was  cautioned  by  the  British
         Transport Police for travelling on a  railway  without  paying  the
         fare.


         On 9 August  2007,  the  Claimant  appeared  at  Camberwell  Green
         Juvenile  Court  for   robbery   and   sentenced   to   supervision
         requirements  for  nine  months  at  �100.00   costs   and   �18.50
         compensation.


         On 6 December 2007  the  Claimant  appeared  at  Camberwell  Green
         Juvenile Court for taking  a  motor  vehicle  without  consent  and
         sentenced to 56 days' curfew, disqualified  from  driving  for  six
         months.  His driving licence was endorsed and he was ordered to pay
         �20.00 costs.


         On 23 November 2009, the Claimant  appeared  at  Camberwell  Green
         Magistrates' Court for  theft,  shoplifting  and  sentenced  to  12
         months conditional discharge and �60.00 Costs.


         On 23 March 2012, the Claimant was convicted at Blackfriars  Crown
         Court for theft from a person sentenced to  6  months  imprisonment
         consecutive, wholly suspended for 24 months, 120  hours  of  unpaid
         work  requirement,  supervision  requirement  programme  that   was
         subsequently varied on  6  July  2012,  to  40  hours  unpaid  work
         requirement, consecutive.


         On 14 May 2012, the Claimant appeared at  North  Kent  Magistrates
         Court for travelling on a  railway  without  paying  the  fare  and
         sentenced to a �400.00 fine, �85.00 costs, �4.40  compensation  and
         �15.00 surcharge.


         On 27 February 2013, the Claimant was convicted at Woolwich  Crown
         Court for attempted  robbery  and  commission  of  further  offence
         during an operational period of a suspended sentence order.  He was
         sentenced to 12 weeks imprisonment wholly suspended for 24  months,
         150 hours unpaid work requirement, 100 days curfew requirement with
         electronic  tagging  on  counts  1  and   8   months   imprisonment
         consecutive, wholly suspended for 24 months.


         On 25 September 2013, the Claimant appeared at South  East  London
         Magistrates Court for theft and committed to the crown  court  with
         sentence for unconditional bail.


         On 9 December  2013,  the  Claimant  appeared  at  Central  London
         Magistrates for travelling on a railway without paying a  fare  and
         fined �400.00 and �35.00 costs.


         On 10 December 2013, the Claimant appeared at  South  East  London
         Magistrates Court for common assault and  sentenced  to  12  months
         conditional discharge and �15.00 victim surcharge.


         On 17 February 2014, the Claimant was  convicted  at  the  Central
         Criminal Court for robbery and  commission  of  a  further  offence
         during the operational period of a suspended sentence  order.   The
         Claimant was sentenced to 19 months imprisonment and �120.00 victim
         surcharge on count 1 and 11 months imprisonment on count 2,  making
         a total of 30 months' imprisonment in relation to which he did  not
         appeal against his conviction or sentence.


         On 30 April 2014, the Claimant  was  convicted  at  Central  Crown
         Court for theft and commission of  a  further  offence  during  the
         operational period of a suspended sentence order and  sentenced  to
         28 days imprisonment, concurrent.


         In light of his conviction the Claimant was served with  a  notice
         of liability letter on 13 June and 7 August  2014  in  relation  to
         which response was received on 13 August 2014."


3.   The First-tier Tribunal Judge in taking account  of  the  Secretary  of
    State's letter of refusal, noted at paragraph 33 of his  decision  that
    the Secretary of State had "taken the view that time  spent  in  prison
    does  not  constitute  residence  for  the   purposes   of   the   2006
    Regulations."


4.   The Judge in continuing his reasoning over paragraphs 34 to 37  of  his
    decision concluded at paragraph 38 that:

         "I therefore find as a matter of fact that the  statement  by  the
         (Secretary of State) that there was simply no evidence  as  to  the
         (Claimant's) residence in the United Kingdom  for  more  than  five
         years appears to be erroneous."


5.   The Judge's reasoning in that regard was as follows:

     "34.     In terms of  residence  the  Respondent  calculated  that  the
             Appellant entered the United Kingdom in 1995 but as there  was
             no evidence to substantiate the date of entry  the  Respondent
             stated the Appellant's residence from 25 May 2000 when he  was
             granted residence for five years as a dependant of his partner
             Mr Sylvian Yaba a French national.

     35. On 21 June 2005 he was granted indefinite  leave  to  remain  as  a
             dependant  on  his  father's  application.    The   Respondent
             therefore only recognised the five year continuous  period  of
             residence from May 2000 to May 2005.  The Respondent  did  not
             accept that he had been continuously resident  in  the  United
             Kingdom for ten years as he had not provided any evidence.

     36. Pausing there that decision appears to  fly  in  the  face  of  the
             Respondent's own  known  case  where  it  is  clear  that  the
             Respondents having cited the Appellant's criminal  convictions
             from 9 August 2007 through to 10  December  2013  whereby  the
             nature of the sentences that were passed, suspended  sentences
             for supervision, fines taken  into  account,  curfews,  unpaid
             work requirements, conditional bail and the commission of  the
             actual offences themselves which clearly predates any sentence
             by several weeks or months.  There  is  overwhelming  evidence
             that this Appellant had been resident in  the  United  Kingdom
             between 2007 and 2014 when he was  sentenced  at  the  Central
             Criminal Court on 17 February 2014.

     37. The only period that there  appears  no  documentary  evidence  for
             relates to the period between 21 June 2005 and 9 August  2007.
             This is the period when the Appellant was  granted  indefinite
             leave to remain as a dependant of his father's application and
             therefore there is a strong presumption that the  reason  that
             was done was to  provide  for  his  residence  in  the  United
             Kingdom.

     38. I therefore find as a matter of fact  that  the  statement  by  the
             Respondent there was simply no evidence as to the  Appellant's
             residence in the United  Kingdom  for  more  than  five  years
             appears to be erroneous."

6.   The Judge noted at paragraph 47 that the Secretary  of  State  accepted
    that the Claimant had acquired a permanent right of  residence  in  the
    United Kingdom  "even  on  the  basis  of  his  five  years  that  they
    assessed."

7.   For the sake of completeness and for the purposes of  clarity  I  pause
    there to set out below as to what the Secretary of State had to say  in
    that regard over paragraphs 22 to 25 of her refusal letter:

     "22.     You claim to have entered the  UK  in  1995  but  provided  no
             evidence  to  substantiate  your  date  of   entry.    However
             according to Home Office records  on  25  May  2000  you  were
             granted a residence permit for five years as  a  dependant  of
             your father Mr Sylvian Yaba a French  national.   On  21  June
             2005  you  were  granted  indefinite  leave  to  remain  as  a
             dependant of your father's application.

     23. It is accepted that you have been resident in the UK in  accordance
             with the 2006 Regulations for  a  continuous  period  of  five
             years as explained above.  From the information available from
             our records on 25 May 2000 you were granted a residence permit
             for  five  years  as  a  dependant  therefore  you  have  been
             exercising your Treaty Rights for a continuous period of  five
             years in accordance with the EEA Regulations.

     24. It is not accepted that you have been continuously resident in  the
             UK for ten years  in  accordance  with  the  2006  Regulations
             because you have not provided any evidence.

      25.  Consequently  consideration  has  been  given  to  whether   your
             deportation is warranted on serious grounds of public policy."



   8.     I must say that at first glance, it was difficult to understand as
      to how the Claimant needed the grant of indefinite leave to remain  as
      a French citizen but upon closer examination it is  apparent  that  it
      was granted parasitic to his father's grant.  However he  remained  an
      EEA national and it follows that if, as in this case, deportation  was
      subsequently  sought,  that  involved   the   2006   EEA   Regulations
      notwithstanding the grant of indefinite leave to remain. The effect of
      the deportation order made under Section 5 of the Immigration Act 1971
      was to invalidate the grant of ILR.


   9.    This of course raises an important difference, because as such, the
      Immigration Rules did not apply and the Claimant was entitled  to  the
      additional protection to which an EEA national is entitled.   As  held
      in Straszewski [2015] EWCA Civ 1245,  the  EEA  2006  Regulations  (as
      amended) not least in terms  of  Regulation  21  (as  applies  in  the
      present case) comprise a regime entirely separate from the Immigration
      Rules and that any derogation from the right to free movement in  them
      must be strictly construed.

  10. Whilst in cases involving the deportation of foreign  criminals  under
      Section 32 of the UK Borders Act 2007 it is well-established that  the
      need to  deter  other  potential  wrongdoers  and  to  reflect  public
      revulsion of the  offence  in  question  are  aspects  of  the  public
      interest in deportation and as such important factors for the decision
      maker to take into account -  the  origin  and  purpose  of  the  2006
      Regulations however are fundamentally different.

  11. EEA nationals are entitled to exercise treaty rights and an  important
      purpose of the Regulations is to protect and support the treaty rights
      to free movement in a case where the removal of an  EEA  national  may
      prima facie interfere with the exercise of his treaty  rights  and  it
      was for the member state to justify such action.

  12. Regulation 21(5) provides that a decision to remove  an  EEA  national
      with a permanent right of residence has to be based exclusively on the
      personal conduct of the person  concerned  and  matters  that  do  not
      directly  relate  to  the  particular   case   relating   to   general
      considerations  of  general  prevention,  do  not  justify  a  removal
      decision.

  13. The grounds upon which the Secretary of State obtained  permission  to
      appeal to this Tribunal were  concisely  reflected  in  the  grant  of
      permission by Upper Tribunal Judge Blum dated 22 June 2016 (and indeed
      in the passages to which Mr Duffy referred me in his submissions to me
      today) as follows

     "The Judge evaluated the decision to deport  the  Appellant  under  the
         Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 on the  basis
         that the Appellant had resided for a continuous period of at  least
         ten years prior to the decision and that his removal could only  be
         justified on imperative grounds of public  security  in  accordance
         with Regulation 21(4) of the 2006 Regulations (at [69] and [70]).

     It is arguable that the Judge failed to  apply  MG  (Prison  -  Article
         28(3)(a) of Citizens Directive)  Portugal  [2014]  UKUT  392  (IAC)
         which considered the judgment  of  the  Court  of  Justice  of  the
         European Union in C-400/12 SSHD v MG with respect to the meaning of
         the 'enhanced protection' provision.  The CJEU case made clear that
         the ten year period should be calculated by counting back from  the
         date of the expulsion decision and that, in principle,  periods  of
         imprisonment interrupted the continuity of the period of residence.
           A  period  of  imprisonment  during  those  ten  years  did   not
         necessarily  prevent  a  person  from   qualifying   for   enhanced
         protection if that person was sufficiently integrated, even  though
         according to the same judgment, a  period  of  imprisonment  had  a
         negative impact insofar as establishing integration was  concerned.
         It is arguable the Judge's consideration of integration, which  was
         relatively cursory, was not done in the manner required by  MG  and
         Ahmed Warsame v SSHD [2016] EWCA Civ 16  (on  the  basis  that  the
         Appellant fell within the 'maybe' category identified by Warsame at
         [9] and [10]."

14.  Longmore LJ who gave the leading judgment in  Warsame  had  this  inter
         alia to say

     "9. Be all that as it may, Mr Greatorex  submits  that  FV  (Italy)  on
             which the second Upper Tribunal determination depended  is  no
             longer good law.  He further  submits  that  any  sentence  of
             imprisonment in the ten years  before  the  deportation  order
             must in principle  prevent  an  applicant  from  accruing  ten
             years' residence.  He accepts that there is a 'maybe' category
             of cases under MG (Portugal) where a person has resided in the
             host  state  during  the  ten  years  prior  to  imprisonment,
             depending on an  overall  assessment  of  whether  integrating
             links have been broken and that in  such  cases  it  might  be
             relevant to determine by way of overall assessment, the degree
             of integration in the host member state or the extent to which
             links with the original member state have been broken...

     10. For my part I accept those  submissions  and  accept  that  in  the
             light of MG (Portugal) the decision based on FV  Italy  cannot
             be sustained.  It cannot be said that Mr Warsame had not  been
             in prison in the ten years preceding the expulsion nor can  it
             be said there was a  ten  year  period  of  residence  between
             Easter 1998 and March 2007 when he received the first sentence
             of imprisonment.  Nor is there any finding from  the  Tribunal
             below that there were  ten  qualifying  albeit  non-continuous
             years of residence ... there is thus no basis for saying  that
             what Mr Greatorex categorised as the  'maybe'  aspects  of  MG
             (Portugal) are applicable in this case."

15.  At paragraph 66 of the First-tier Tribunal Judge's decision, he  stated
    that he had found "overwhelming evidence .. that there was a period  of
    continuous residence (for the Claimant) from  1995  until  the  present
    time.  That continuity having been broken by his incarceration in  2014
    ..."  Thus the Judge accepted that there was  an  interruption  in  the
    Claimant's continuity of residence  counting  back  from  the  date  of
    decision.  At paragraph 67 the Judge considered as he was  entitled  to
    do, what happened before and concluded that he was satisfied  that  the
    Claimant "had some nineteen years of residence in  the  United  Kingdom
    and not the five years as claimed by the (Secretary of State)."

  16. Absent from that  conclusion,  was  the  all  important  reference  to
      "continuous residence."  Contrary to the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge's
      interpretation, the reference by the Secretary of State to five  years
      was simply  to  accept  that  the  Claimant  qualified  for  permanent
      residence.  This was not an assertion that the period of residence was
      only five years.


  17. At paragraph 68 the Judge looked at the circumstances and continued

         "This is also supported by his list of previous convictions  which
         run for almost every year between 2007  and  2014.   This  has  the
         fundamental effect therefore  on  the  law  which  applies  to  the
         (Claimant's) case and therefore there is a fundamental  mistake  in
         the (Secretary of State) assessment that the (Claimant) is not only
         an EEA national resident for five years but  an  EEA  national  who
         under Regulation 21 enjoys the protection of the  higher  test  for
         obtaining deportation."

18.  The Judge continued at paragraph 69 as follows:

         "This can only be affected on the basis  that  there  are  serious
         grounds of public  policy  or  public  security  and  that  an  EEA
         national has resided in the UK from the  continuous  period  of  at
         least ten years prior to  the  deportation  decision  may  only  be
         deported on imperative grounds of public security."


  19. Thus at paragraph 70, the Judge concluded  that  he  found  that  "the
      (Claimant) can only  be  deported  on  imperative  grounds  of  public
      security."


  20. The Secretary of State maintains, that in reaching that  finding,  the
      Judge failed to properly consider the  requirements  under  Regulation
      21(4) of the 2006 Regulations that the Claimant  had  resided  in  the
      United Kingdom for a continuous period of at least ten years "prior to
      the relevant decision."  Reference is made to the  ruling  in  the  MG
      case where the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled that:

         ".. the ten year period of residence ..  must,  in  principle,  be
         continuous and must be calculated by counting back from the date of
         the decision ordering the expulsion of the person concerned .."


    and that


         "a period of  imprisonment  is,  in  principle,  capable  of  both
         interrupting the continuity of the  period  of  residence  for  the
         purposes of that provision of affecting the decision regarding  the
         grant of the enhanced protection provided for thereunder even where
         the person concerned resided in the host member state for  the  ten
         years prior to imprisonment ..."


    21.  The Secretary of State thus contends that in light of that ruling,
    the Judge  ought  to  have  considered  the  ten  years  prior  to  the
    deportation decision and that


         "Given that a period of imprisonment is capable of interrupting the
         continuity of the period of residence, it  is  submitted  that  the
         First-tier Tribunal should not have considered that the  (Claimant)
         automatically benefited from the enhanced protection of  Regulation
         21(4) as he had not resided in the United Kingdom for a  continuous
         period of at least ten years prior to the relevant decision"


    and that as such, the findings of the Judge at  paragraphs  68  and  70
    demonstrated a material misdirection (and misunderstanding) of the  law
    "and was thus inadequately reasoned."


  21. Thus the appeal came before me today on 25 July 2016,  when  my  first
      task was to decide whether the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
      Judge disclosed an error or errors on a point of law such as may  have
      materially affected the outcome of the appeal.


  22. The Claimant was not present having not been brought to court  by  the
      Prison Service.  In that regard I was informed by my clerk  and  I  in
      turn informed Mr Duffy for the Secretary of State, that  the  Claimant
      had apparently been disruptive and non-compliant and that when  TASCOR
      had arrived at the prison to collect him, a risk assessment  was  made
      when it was concluded that to bring him to court would need a crew  of
      four that was not logistically possible.  I thus explained to Mr Duffy
      that I could proceed with the hearing  of  the  Secretary  of  State's
      appeal in the Claimant's absence only if it was in  the  interests  of
      justice to do so.  I would therefore receive  Mr  Duffy's  submissions
      and then decide whether I could proceed with the appeal to  the  Upper
      Tribunal without having to hear from the Claimant.   Mr  Duffy  agreed
      that that was the best course indeed in the interests of justice.

  23. In that regard I was further mindful of the  provisions  of  paragraph
      38(b) of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal)  Rules  2008  namely,
      that if a party failed to attend a hearing, the Upper  Tribunal  might
      proceed with the hearing if the Upper Tribunal considered that it  was
      in the interests of justice to proceed with the hearing.

  24. Having heard Mr Duffy's submissions and having considered the evidence
      as a whole, I have concluded that it would  be  in  the  interests  of
      justice to proceed and conclude this hearing as I am satisfied for the
      reasons that I shall now give, that notwithstanding the absence of the
      Claimant but given the representations before me, the conclusion  that
      I have reached would be the same.

  25. I find that the Secretary of State's challenge in this regard has been
      made out not least for the reasons given in the grounds  of  challenge
      (above).  It is apparent that at paragraphs 67 and 69 of his  decision
      the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  was  looking   at   the   Claimant's
      accumulated period of residence  of  nineteen  years  as  he  saw  it,
      whereas he had already correctly stated  at  paragraph  66,  that  the
      period of residence counting back  from  the  date  of  the  expulsion
      decision was broken by the Claimant's imprisonment.

  26. The decision of the Court of Justice (above)  was  considered  by  the
      Upper Tribunal in MG (Prison - Article 28(3)(a) of Citizens Directive)
      Portugal [2014] UKUT 00392 (IAC) where the Tribunal concluded that:


         "The judgment should be understood as  meaning  that  a  period  of
         imprisonment during those ten years does not necessarily prevent  a
         person from qualifying for enhanced protection if  that  person  is
         sufficiently integrated.  However, according to the same  judgment,
         a period of imprisonment must have a  negative  impact  insofar  as
         establishing integration is concerned."


    The  fact  that  different  concepts  are  in  play   in   respect   of
    qualification for permanent residence and access to the  highest  level
    of protection against removal, is evident from the  vocabulary  of  the
    relevant provisions of the Directive and the EEA  Regulations  and  the
    significance and purpose  of  the  distinction  is  reinforced  by  the
    recitals to the Directive.


    27. Thus in respect of qualification for permanent  residence,  Article
    16 of the Directive requires that the EEA national must have


         "resided legally for a continuous period of five years ..."


    and the EEA Regulations demand that the EEA national must have:


         "..  resided  in  the  United  Kingdom  in  accordance  with  these
         Regulations for a continuous period of five years  ..."(underlining
         added).


    28. By  contrast,  in  order  to  qualify  for  the  highest  level  of
    protection against removal, Article 28(3) (a) of  the  EEA  Regulations
    provides that a relevant decision may not be taken except on imperative
    grounds in respect of the EEA national who:


         "has resided in the United Kingdom for a continuous  period  of  at
         least ten years prior to the relevant decision."


29.  It follows from  MG,  that  the  Judge  was  required  to  consider  in
    particular, two matters.  Firstly, could he conclude counting back from
    the date of decision, that the Claimant had enjoyed a continuous period
    of ten years' residence unbroken by a period of  imprisonment?  I  find
    for the above reasons, that on the evidence  before  him,  the  Judge's
    conclusion should have been that the Claimant had failed to do  so  and
    that in consequence the Judge materially erred in law.

30.   The  second  matter  the   Judge   had   to   consider   was   whether
    notwithstanding the above, the Claimant's integrating  links  with  the
    United Kingdom (the Member State) were such that it did not necessarily
    disqualify him from the  highest  level  of  protection.   This  indeed
    coincides with the Secretary of State's grounds that further  challenge
    in my view appropriately, that the Judge's decision did not  take  into
    account that:

         ".. the issue of integration is not  solely  related  to  temporal
         factors as relied upon by the FTTJ at paragraph 76 but  requires  a
         qualitative assessment that is absent from the determination."


31.   I  pause  there  to  set  out  below  paragraph  76  of  the   judge's
    determination in which he had this to say:

         "This is an Appellant who is clearly well integrated into  life  in
         the United Kingdom in any event.  He has been here since the age of
         4 years of age and his list of criminal convictions in any event by
         themselves ought not to determine his susceptibility to removal  by
         themselves."


32.  I also set out for the  sake  of  completeness,  paragraph  77  of  his
    decision as follows:

         "I find that the Appellant is socially  and  culturally  integrated
         into the United Kingdom as one would expect from a person  who  has
         been here from the age of 4 years of age to his current status  and
         age as an adult."


33.  The Secretary of State's challenge continues as follows:

         "It is submitted that the commission of criminal offences indicates
         that the Appellant has rejected societal values while his offending
         history showed a disregard for  fellow  citizens  and  demonstrated
         anti-social behaviour.  Furthermore following MG 'the imposition of
         a prison sentence by the National Court is such as to show that non-
         compliance by the person concerned with the values expressed by the
         Society of the host Member State in its criminal law Case  C-400/12
         and Case C-378/12 at [31].'"


34.  The Secretary of State's grounds continue:

         "The Appellant was sentenced to 30 months' imprisonment in February
         2014.  The decision of the SSHD to deport the Appellant was made on
         24 November 2014.  Clearly the Appellant had received  a  custodial
         sentence in the ten years preceding  the  expulsion  decision.   At
         [69] the FTTJ appears to pick  up  a  [pre-imprisonment]  ten  year
         period and does not consider the relevant issue in accordance  with
         Onuekwere v SSHD and SSHD v MG ... the SSHD asserts that given  the
         index cluster of your sentence the  Appellant  cannot  prima  facie
         rely on imperative grounds and the FTTJ does not explicitly rely on
         or adequately engage with the 'maybe' category as articulated in MG
         and Warsame ..."


35.      I agree.  I am satisfied that in the present case, what the  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge needed to but failed to do, was to consider whether
    notwithstanding the Claimant's period of imprisonment  and  mindful  of
    the guidance with the case law to which  I  have  above  referred,  the
    Claimant was not disqualified from  the  highest  level  of  protection
    notwithstanding the fact that as found by the Judge  the  Claimant  had
    been here for nineteen years.  The fact is that the Judge failed to  do
    that and as such he materially erred in law.

   36. It was a material error, because in consequence of his  reasoning  we
    do not know whether if he had taken the correct approach he would  have
    reached the same decision.

   37.      On the evidence before him, the Judge should have  concluded  in
    principle, that the Claimant  did  not  have  the  enhanced  protection
    because counting back from the  date  of  the  expulsion  decision  the
    Claimant did not have ten years' continuous residence.   The  error  he
    made was that he failed to say that it was necessary to balance the ten
    year  period  before  the  Claimant's  imprisonment  against  what  the
    position  was  in  principle  and  ask  himself  if  the  Claimant  was
    sufficiently integrated despite the period of imprisonment such  as  to
    be entitled to the enhanced level of protection.

38.  The Judge simply failed  to  appreciate  that  once  the  Claimant  was
    sentenced to a term of imprisonment he had lost the enhanced protection
    and could only get it back by showing that despite the imprisonment the
    Claimant's integrated links were  such  as  to  bring  him  within  the
    principles of MG.

 39.  I find that the Judge's reasoning simply and further  failed  to  take
    into account the continuous offending of the  Claimant  that  indicated
    the best example of not having so integrated. I therefore find that the
    Judge's  conclusion  the  Claimant  was  well-integrated  was  in   the
    circumstances a perverse decision.  The Judge appears to have concluded
    that he was entitled  to  focus  alone  on  the  Claimant's  length  of
    residence as he found it to be, while disregarding the behaviour of the
    Claimant that arguably demonstrated a lack of integration.

   40. I have  however  concluded,  not  least  given  the  absence  of  the
    Claimant before me today, that the interests of justice  require  there
    to be a need to properly assess whether the Claimant is entitled to the
    lower or enhanced level of protection under the 2006  EEA  Regulations.
    That is the test that needs to be applied and for which there needs  to
    be a full and careful consideration.

    41. Mr Duffy has asked that  in  those  circumstances,  the  appropriate
    course is to remit this case to be reheard before a First-tier Tribunal
    Judge other than First-tier Tribunal Judge Herbert OBE at  the  hearing
    centre at Taylor House. Having considered how the decision should be re-
    made I find myself in agreement with that proposal.  This  will  be  on
    the basis that First-tier Tribunal Judge Herbert applied the wrong test
    and so there has been no assessment at all.  His findings of  fact  can
    thus be preserved but not the conclusions that he drew from them.  That
    will be a matter of fresh assessment  by  another  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge, taking account of any further  evidence  that  the  parties  may
    produce at the fresh hearing.

   42.  I am not told because he is not  here  but  would  as  a  matter  of
    prudence assume, that the Claimant will intend to give oral evidence in
    relation to which no interpreter will be require. I am  unaware  as  to
    whether  he  would  intend  to  call   further   witnesses.   In   such
    circumstances, I would suggest that it would be appropriate  that  this
    matter be given a time estimate of three hours.

43.  Thus there  are  I  find,  highly  compelling  reasons  falling  within
    paragraph 7.2 of the Senior President's Practice Statement  as  to  why
    the decision should not be re-made by the Upper Tribunal.

44.  The appeal of the Secretary of State is  thus  allowed  to  the  extent
    that the appeal shall now be remitted to a  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    other than First-tier Tribunal Judge Herbert OBE to  the  Taylor  House
    Hearing Centre to be heard on the first available date.

Notice of Decision

The making of the previous decision did involve the making of  an  error  or
errors on a point of law and I order that it shall not stand.

No anonymity direction or request for such anonymity has been made  at  this
stage.
