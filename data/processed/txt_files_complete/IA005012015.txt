               THE Secretary of State FOR THE Home Department

For the Respondent/Claimant:    Mr S Nwachwu, Moorehouse Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Secretary of State  appeals  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  against  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal (Judge M Symes sitting at  Richmond
    on 22 July 2015) allowing the claimant's appeal against the decision of
    the Secretary of State to refuse to issue him  with  an  EEA  residence
    card confirming his right to reside in the United Kingdom as the spouse
    of an EEA national  exercising  treaty  rights  here.   The  First-tier
    Tribunal did not make an anonymity direction, and  I  do  not  consider
    that  the  claimant  requires  to  be  accorded  anonymity  for   these
    proceedings in the Upper Tribunal.

Reasons for Granting Permission to Appeal

 2. On 9 December 2015  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Frankish  granted  the
    Secretary of State permission to appeal for the following reasons:

         "2.  The application for permission to appeal asserts that the  FTJ
             wrongly rested solely on Devaseelan [2003] Imm AR  as  to  the
             sponsor not having entered a marriage of convenience.   In  so
             doing, he has omitted to address the question of  whether  the
             sponsor was a qualified person exercising treaty rights  under
             Reg 6 per Boodhoo [2013] UKUT 346.

         3.   Reading the determination indicates an arguable error  arising
             from the application of Devaseelan  without  consideration  of
             Reg 6".

Relevant Background

 3. On 30 May 2014 the claimant, a national of Austria, attended a marriage
    registry at Brent  Civic  Centre  with  a  view  to  marrying  Lovelyna
    Eromonsele, an Austrian national.  They had met at the TREM  Church  in
    Nigeria, and their relationship had started in 2012.  They  had  become
    engaged on 31 July 2013.  He had come  to  the  United  Kingdom  on  21
    January 2014, and his sponsor had joined him in  the  UK  around  March
    2014.

 4. At the marriage registry they were met  by  Immigration  Officers,  who
    prevented the wedding from going ahead.  The sponsor  was  served  with
    removal directions  for  her  alleged  abuse  of  treaty  rights.   The
    claimant was granted temporary admission, and subsequently both he  and
    the sponsor were informed that they could continue with their  marriage
    plans.  The sponsor found work with the Redeemed Evangelical Mission on
    2 June 2014, and the couple married on 16 June 2014.

 5. On 15 August 2014 the claimant made a second  application  for  an  EEA
    residence card, which was refused on 21 October 2014 on the ground that
    the marriage entered into on 16  June  2014  was  one  of  convenience.
    Additionally, attempts to  contact  the  sponsor's  place  of  work  by
    telephone had failed.

 6. While the claimant's appeal against  this  decision  was  pending,  the
    sponsor's appeal against removal directions was heard by Judge Courtney
    in the First-tier Tribunal in January 2015.  Judge Courtney allowed the
    sponsor's appeal, as the Secretary of State had not satisfied her  that
    the case involved a marriage of convenience.

The Hearing Before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

 7. Mr Nwachwu appeared on behalf of the claimant before Judge Symes. There
    was no appearance  on  behalf  of  the  Secretary  of  State.   In  his
    subsequent decision, the judge noted at paragraph [4] that  the  second
    reason for rejecting the claimant's application for  a  residence  card
    was that attempts to contact his sponsor's place of work  by  telephone
    had failed.  Under the heading of "Marriage of Convenience", the  judge
    set out his findings on the marriage of convenience issue at paragraphs
    [10] to [14].  The first two of  these  paragraphs  quoted  extensively
    from Papajorgji and the guidance from the Commission  to  the  European
    Parliament and Council which is annexed to it.  He continued:

         "12. The starting point for my assessment of the case is the  prior
             determination by Immigration Judge Courtney.  The  approach  I
             should take  to  those  findings  is  set  out  in  Devaseelan
             (Secretary of State for the Home Department v D (Tamil) [2002]
             UKIAT 00702): in short her determination is the  authoritative
             historic resolution of the case, although  I  am  entitled  to
             take account subsequent facts.

         13.  Whilst I appreciate that the Appellant's appeal  represents  a
             different case to that of his wife, as she is an EEA  national
             entitled to a registration certificate whereas he is  a  third
             country national  family  member  seeking  a  residence  card,
             nevertheless the cases arise in the context of the closest  of
             family members involving precisely the same fact  pattern  (ie
             the reality of their relationship) as was considered by  Judge
             Courtney.  It seems to me that Devaseelan principles do  apply
             here, see generally AA (Somalia) [2007] EWCA Civ 1040.  In any
             event my own thinking on the case fully accords with  that  of
             Judge Courtney, whose findings  set  out  above  I  gratefully
             adopt.

         14.  I do not accept that the Respondent has established  that  the
             Appellant and EEA Sponsor were in a marriage of convenience".

Reasons for Finding an Error of Law

 8. The decision of Judge Courtney was solely directed at the  question  of
    whether the Secretary of State had made out her case that the sponsor's
    removal was justified on the grounds of abuse of rights  in  accordance
    with Regulation 21B.  This provides that the abuse of a right to reside
    includes:

    (c)  entering, attempting to enter or assisting another person to enter
         or  attempt  to  enter,  a  marriage  or   civil   partnership   of
         convenience.

 9. Judge Courtney did not make any finding on the question of whether  the
    sponsor was exercising treaty rights as a worker, as this  was  not  an
    issue before her.

10. Mr Nwachwu sought to defend the decision of Judge Symes on  the  ground
    that his findings on the marriage of convenience issue also included in
    passing a finding that the sponsor was a qualified  person.   In  order
    for the sponsor to be, "an EEA  national  entitled  to  a  registration
    certificate", the judge must  have  found  that  she  was  a  qualified
    person.

11. The difficulty with this proposition is  twofold.   Firstly,  that  the
    judge has not engaged with the reason given in the refusal  letter  for
    disputing that the sponsor was in  employment  as  claimed.   Secondly,
    about a year had elapsed since the  sponsor  claimed  to  have  entered
    employment with the Redeemed Evangelical Mission, and the judge  needed
    to take into account "subsequent facts"  pertaining  to  the  sponsor's
    claimed exercise of treaty rights.  His finding that  the  sponsor  was
    entitled to a registration certificate is not supported by reference to
    contemporaneous evidence of the exercise of treaty rights,  or  by  any
    discernible reasoning beyond reliance on the earlier decision of  Judge
    Courtney.  As previously canvassed,  Judge  Courtney  did  not  make  a
    finding that the sponsor was a qualified person.

12. As the judge failed to make a reasoned finding on the issue whether the
    sponsor was a qualified person at the date of the hearing  before  him,
    his decision to allow the appeal outright was erroneous in law.

The Remaking of the Decision

13. Having informed the parties of my ruling on the error of  law  question
    (with extended written reasons to follow in due course), I  invited  Mr
    Nwachwu to tender the sponsor as a witness.

14. Her evidence was  that  she  worked  as  a  personnel  assistant.   Her
    employer was called Terry Services.  Her wages, which  were  paid  into
    her bank account, came from TM Logistics, which was the  same  business
    entity.   My  attention  was  directed  to   the   documents   in   the
    supplementary bundle which had been prepared for  the  hearing  in  the
    Upper Tribunal.  These documents included a run of bank  statements  in
    the sponsor's name.   These  bank  statements  showed  the  payment  of
    monthly wages into her account from  TM  Logistics.   The  most  recent
    payment shown in the bank statements (which ran from July  2015  to  18
    January 2016) was a payment of �1,236.66 from TM Logistics on 6 January
    2016.

15. The bundle also contained pay slips issued by  Terry  Services  to  the
    sponsor over the same period.  I noted that the net pay  amounts  shown
    in the pay slips matched the wages being paid  into  her  bank  account
    from TM Logistics.

Findings on Remaking

16. Regulation 16(2) provides that in the case of a worker, confirmation of
    the  worker's  engagement  from  his  employer  or  a  certificate   of
    employment is sufficient proof for the purposes of paragraph (1)(b).

17. There is not a letter from the sponsor's employer,  or  a  contract  of
    employment.  However, I consider that the evidence  of  the  pay  slips
    taken in conjunction with the  sponsor's  bank  statements  constitutes
    sufficient proof that the sponsor is  exercising  treaty  rights  as  a
    worker, and is  therefore  a  qualified  person  for  the  purposes  of
    Regulation 6.  Her general credibility on the topic of the exercise  of
    treaty rights as a worker is reinforced by the other documents  in  the
    supplementary bundle, which show that she was formerly employed by  the
    Redeemed Evangelical Mission, but that employment with them  ceased  at
    the end of September 2015, as  evidenced  by  a  P45  that  the  former
    employer issued, showing that her accrued earnings for the relevant tax
    year up until 30 September 2015 were just over �5,000.  I am  satisfied
    on the evidence provided that the sponsor  began  her  employment  with
    Terry Services at the beginning of July 2015, and that she continues to
    be employed by Terry Services at the date of the hearing before me.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  contained  an  error  of  law,  and
accordingly the  decision  is  set  aside  and  the  following  decision  is
substituted: this appeal under the Regulations 2006 is allowed.

I make no anonymity direction.
