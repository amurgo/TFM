Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr C Avery, a Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr F Mehmood, Abbott, Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The respondent, Prasad Bhagawanrao Shinde, was born on 4 December  1978
    and is a male citizen  of  India.   I  shall  hereafter  refer  to  the
    respondent as "the appellant" and to the Secretary  of  State  as  "the
    respondent", as they were respectively before the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. The appellant was refused leave to enter the United Kingdom on  3  June
    2013 at which date his continuing leave to enter/remain was  cancelled.
    The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal (Judge  P  J  Clarke)
    which, in a determination promulgated on 26 February 2014, allowed  the
    appeal.  The respondent was granted permission to appeal to  the  Upper
    Tribunal by Judge Grant on 14 March 2014.

 3. The appellant had come to the United Kingdom first in 2007 as a student
    and subsequently obtained a Tier 1 visa on 29 November  2011.   He  was
    granted leave to remain as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant  on  12  February
    2013.  He returned to India for a holiday and came back into the United
    Kingdom on 3 June 2013.  Upon his return,  he  was  interviewed  by  an
    Immigration Officer.  The First-tier Tribunal at [10(xii)] provides  an
    account of the appellant's interview with the Immigration Officer:

         I have been provided with a copy of the interview notes (which  are
         in some cases hard to follow) and  a  typed  copy.   At  Q48,  [the
         appellant] was asked how he could earn �23,000  in  India,  how  he
         could do that, when he was not in India, he replied, 'it's a  lie.'
         At Q49 he stated that he had not declared this to HMRC.  At Q50  he
         claimed to have earned �26,465 in  India  for  his  company  Shinde
         Instance, how could he do that when he was living  in  the  UK;  he
         replied 'it's all a lie.'  At Q51 he was reminded that he said that
         in the period May - November 2012 he had only four -  five  clients
         [in the UK - Q40] and also that he had earned only �11,000  in  the
         two years since the company was set up.  No comment was  made.   At
         Q52 he was asked if he had made up the figure.  No comment was made
         [it is unclear from the interview record whether the appellant said
         'no comment' or that he made no comment].

 4. The judge goes on to record that, in a witness statement, the appellant
    has claimed that he did not say "it's a lie" in answer to questions 48,
    50, 51 and 52.  There was evidence  from  the  appellant  that  he  had
    become stressed and tired following his long flight from India.

 5. At [12] the judge considered  the  account  of  what  had  happened  at
    Heathrow Airport.  The judge found that the  appellant  had  failed  to
    indicate to the  Immigration  Officer  that  he  had  been  "tired  and
    stressed" and he did not say  anything  to  the  interviewing  officers
    about his "family problems."  The judge found that  the  appellant  was
    probably tired following his flight.  He found that the  appellant  had
    not chosen to read the interview record although he had been given  the
    opportunity to do so.  The judge found that it was  "likely  that  [the
    appellant] did not fully understand what he was  signing."   The  judge
    concluded that there was "nothing in the  evidence  before  [me]  which
    justifies any criticism of the Immigration Officer.  He was entitled to
    rely on the information he had been  given  by  the  appellant  at  the
    airport."

 6. The judge  then  went  on  to  consider  the  "income  claimed  in  the
    appellant's  [visa]  application  form."   The  judge   considered   it
    important to determine whether the appellant had been in receipt of the
    income detailed in that  form.   At  [16]  the  judge  found  that  the
    documents were "internally consistent" and as a  consequence  reliable.
    He concluded that he was  "thus  satisfied,  not  without  considerable
    doubt, that [the appellant] has the income he claims from his  business
    in India."  The judge did, however, have a number of concerns regarding
    the appellant's income from his business in the United Kingdom.  He was
    not satisfied that he had "a clear and full  picture  of  his  business
    receipts."  The judge found it difficult to accept that  the  appellant
    had received no income at all from April - November 2012 or again  from
    November  2012  to  April  2013.   He  observed  that  these  might  be
    "matters...of interest to HMRC, although there may be an  explanation."
    At [18] the judge concluded that the  appellant  did  have  the  income
    which brought  him  within  "the  appropriate  band"  required  by  the
    Immigration Rules.

 7. I find that there is a serious problem with the judge's approach to the
    evidence in this case.  Despite finding that  the  Immigration  Officer
    could rely upon the contents of the appellant's interview  in  deciding
    to curtail his existing leave and refuse him leave to enter the  United
    Kingdom, that finding does not appear to have had  any  influence  upon
    the judge's assessment of the documentary evidence which the  appellant
    had submitted with his application.  The  grounds  of  appeal  describe
    this as a "unlawful separation of the evidence".  I agree.  Although he
    accepted that the appellant was probably tired after his  long  flight,
    the judge has effectively found that the appellant  knew  what  he  was
    doing when he said that the sums which claimed to have earned  both  in
    India and the United Kingdom were all "a lie."  I do not understand why
    the judge should have failed to give weight to those admissions when he
    proceeded to consider the remainder of the appellant's evidence. In the
    light of the admissions, it was clearly necessary for the judge to give
    clear and adequate reasons for finding that, although he may have  lied
    to the immigration authorities in the past, the appellant was otherwise
    a witness of truth. However, he did not do  so.  Accordingly,   I  find
    that the judge's approach was flawed and that the determination  should
    be set aside.

 8. I told the representatives at the hearing that I proposed to remake the
    decision in the Upper Tribunal.  I indicated that I could find no error
    of law in the judge's finding that the interview record  was  reliable.
    I indicated that I saw no reason to revisit the judge's  finding  that,
    although he may have been tired, the appellant had been aware  of  what
    he was saying when he gave answers at interview.  Mr Mehmood,  for  the
    appellant, offered no further submissions.

 9. I have considered the documentary evidence and, like Judge Clarke, I am
    not satisfied that this evidence provides a clear and full  picture  of
    the appellant's business activities.  That  observation,  coupled  with
    the appellant's own admissions that the financial details which he  had
    provided were not true or accurate, lead me to conclude the Immigration
    Officer was fully entitled to deny the appellant entry  and  to  cancel
    his existing leave to remain.  By his own admission the  appellant  had
    acted dishonestly in providing false particulars in support of his last
    application for a visa.  In the circumstances, the appeal  against  the
    respondent's decision is dismissed.









DECISION

10.  The determination of the First-tier Tribunal which was promulgated  on
    26 February 2014 is set aside.   I  have  remade  the  decision.   This
    appeal is dismissed.






Signed                              Date 15 May 2014
