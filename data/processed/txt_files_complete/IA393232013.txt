                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Secretary of State appeals to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal allowing the claimant's appeal  against  the
    decision by the Secretary of State to refuse to issue her with  an  EEA
    residence card as confirmation of her derivative right of residence  in
    the UK under Regulation 15A of the Immigration (EEA) Regulations  2006.
    The First-tier Tribunal did not make an anonymity direction, and  I  do
    not consider that the claimant or her daughter  needs  to  be  accorded
    anonymity in these proceedings before the Upper Tribunal.

 2. The claimant is a national  of  Ecuador,  whose  date  of  birth  is  1
    February 1969.  She entered the United Kingdom on 16 June 2003.  On  16
    November 2007 she gave birth to a child, Julia.  Julia's father was  Mr
    Masimo Laurenza, an Italian national exercising treaty  rights  in  the
    United Kingdom.  On 18  November  2010  District  Judge  Wicks  made  a
    financial order in the Uxbridge County Court  under  the  Children  Act
    1989.  He ordered that the respondent  father  (Mr  Laurenza)  pay  the
    applicant mother (the claimant) for the benefit of  the  child  (Julia)
    periodical payments of ï¿½180 per month, the first payment to be made  on
    15 December 2010 by way of standing order until the child attained  the
    age of 17 years, the death of the father or further order of the court,
    whichever event occurred first.

 3. In  2011,  2012  and  2013  the  claimant  made  three  successive  and
    unsuccessful applications for a residence card as the primary carer  of
    Julia.

 4. In the third and last refusal dated 3 September 2013 the  Secretary  of
    State  advanced  two  main  reasons  for   rejecting   the   claimant's
    application.   The  first  was  that  the  claimant  did  not   satisfy
    Regulation 15A(2).  This was because Julia was not residing in  the  UK
    as  a  self-sufficient  person.   The  evidence  submitted  failed   to
    demonstrate sufficiently that Julia had  sufficient  funds  or  had  an
    income from another source that would be sustainable over a  period  of
    time during her period of residence in the United Kingdom.

 5. Alternatively, the claimant did not satisfy Regulation  15A(3).   There
    was no evidence that Julia's father  was  a  legitimate  EEA  national.
    Furthermore, the department had requested evidence to  demonstrate  the
    daughter's father was residing in the  United  Kingdom  and  exercising
    treaty rights after his daughter's  birth  and  on  her  entrance  into
    education.  The department required evidence that Mr  Laurenza  resided
    in the UK as a worker in September 2012,  when  her  daughter  formally
    entered education, and this evidence had not been provided.

The Hearing Before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

 6. The claimant's appeal against the third refusal  decision  came  before
    Judge Dineen sitting at Hatton Cross in the First-tier Tribunal  on  26
    June 2014.  Mr Boyle appeared  on  behalf  of  the  claimant,  and  the
    respondent was represented by Ms Carver.  In his  subsequent  decision,
    Judge Dineen said at paragraph [5] that the  only  outstanding  matters
    between  the  parties  were  whether   the   claimant   satisfied   the
    requirements of subparagraph 4 of Regulation 15A by  establishing  that
    she was the primary carer of  her  daughter  Julia,  and  that  if  the
    claimant was required to leave, Julia would be unable to continue to be
    educated in the UK.

 7. In paragraphs [6] to [17] of his decision, Judge  Dineen  set  out  the
    claimant's case.  In paragraphs [18] and [19} he  summarised  the  case
    put forward by Ms Carver on behalf of the Secretary of  State  as:  (a)
    relying on the contents of  the  refusal  letter;  and  (b)  making  no
    admission as to whether the claimant was Julia's primary carer.

 8. The judge's findings are succinctly set out at paragraph [20]  onwards.
    He had taken into account all the evidence, and he was  satisfied  that
    the claimant was a  truthful  witness.   Her  evidence  was  consistent
    within itself, and consistent with the available documentary  evidence.
    He was satisfied that Mr Laurenza played no part in Julia's  life,  and
    that there was no other person who did so with regard to her day-to-day
    care.  If the claimant had  to  leave,  Julia  would  clearly  have  to
    accompany her back to Ecuador.  She would  therefore  not  be  able  to
    continue her education in the UK.  So  the  judge  allowed  the  appeal
    under the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006.

The Application for Permission to Appeal

 9. A member of the Specialist Appeals  Team  settled  an  application  for
    permission to appeal on behalf of the Secretary of State to  the  Upper
    Tribunal.  The judge had  materially  misdirected  himself  in  law  in
    stating that the  only  outstanding  matter  between  the  parties  was
    whether the claimant was the primary carer of Julia.   In  the  refusal
    letter, the claimant was advised that as there was no evidence to  show
    that the father of the EEA national child was exercising treaty  rights
    when the child entered into formal education, the  Secretary  of  State
    did not consider that Regulation 15A(3) had been met.  Furthermore, the
    refusal letter stated that the claimant had not  produced  evidence  to
    show that the EEA national had comprehensive sickness  insurance  cover
    in the UK, or sufficient resources not to become a burden on the social
    assistance of the United Kingdom during her period  of  residence.   So
    Regulation 4(1)C had also not been complied with.

The Grant of Permission to Appeal

10. On 1 December 2014 First-tier Tribunal Judge Levin  granted  permission
    to appeal for the following reasons:

         Given that the judge failed to  consider  and  make  findings  upon
         whether the [claimant] met the criteria of Reg 15A(3)(b) and (c) of
         the EEA Regs as he was required to  do  by  Reg  15A(4)(a),  it  is
         arguable that the judge's finding that the [claimant] was  entitled
         to derivative right of residence was as  a  result  of  a  material
         error of law.

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

11. At the hearing before me, Mr Boyle drew my attention to  his  extensive
    Rule 24 response and to the evidence which had been served on the Upper
    Tribunal casting further light on the proceedings in the First-tier.

12. The claimant's appeal before the  First-tier  Tribunal  was  originally
    listed for hearing at Hatton Cross on 3 March 2014.  On that day  Judge
    Behan granted an adjournment request made by Mr Boyle and directed  the
    Secretary of State to use her  powers  to  obtain  evidence  (including
    evidence from other  governmental  bodies)  as  to  whether  Mr  Masimo
    Laurenza continued to reside in the UK;  the  times  at  which  he  had
    exercised treaty rights in the UK; and the fact that he was an  Italian
    national.

13. In advance  of  the  hearing  before  Judge  Dineen,  the  Home  Office
    Presenting Unit served a witness statement from Phillip Morris of  HMRC
    setting out the results of his examination  of  HMRC  computer  records
    with regard to Mr Laurenza's employment as an airport baggage  handler.
    The records showed that he had been continuously  employed  in  the  UK
    from the child's birth  to  date,  and  that  his  residential  address
    remained the same  as  the  address  he  had  given  in  the  financial
    statement which he had made in the maintenance proceedings heard by the
    county court in 2010.

Discussion

14. As a result of the evidence tendered by HMRC, the point raised  by  the
    Secretary of State under Regulation 15A(3) fell away, and apparently Ms
    Carver conceded this.  Also, Mr Boyle did not argue in the  alternative
    that Julia met  the  requirements  for  self-sufficiency  contained  in
    Regulation 4.  Thus for the reasonable reader of the decision  who  was
    not privy to what passed at the hearing, it was  misleading  for  Judge
    Dineen to indicate  that  the  Respondent  continued  to  rely  on  the
    contents of the refusal letter.  In fact, Ms Carver's stance on  behalf
    of the Secretary of State was merely a non-admission of a  point  which
    had not been put in issue in the refusal letter, which was whether  the
    claimant was Julia's primary carer.

15. However, I do not find  that  the  lack  of  clarity  in  the  decision
    translates into a material error of law.  The  judge  is  shown  to  be
    correct in holding earlier in his decision that the sole  issue  before
    him under Regulation 15A was whether the claimant met  the  requirement
    of being Julia's primary carer, and whether in consequence Julia  would
    be unable to continue to be educated  in  the  United  Kingdom  if  the
    claimant was required to leave.  The judge gave  adequate  reasons  for
    finding in the claimant's favour on these questions.

16. Even if  there  had  not  been  satisfactory  evidence  of  the  father
    exercising treaty rights at the time that  Julia  entered  into  formal
    education, the claimant would still have  qualified  for  a  derivative
    residence card. This  is  apparent  from  Ahmed  (Amos;  Zambrano;  Reg
    15A(3)(c) [2006] EEA Regs) [2013[ UKUT 00089 (IAC) which Mr  Boyle  was
    going to deploy at the hearing in March 2014 if his adjournment request
    had been unsuccessful.  In Ahmed, a panel  consisting  of  Mrs  Justice
    Lang and Upper Tribunal Judge Storey said this at paragraph [73]:

         In Teixeira the  Court  of  Justice  made  plain  that  it  is  not
         necessary for the child to be in education in the UK at a time when
         an EEA national parent is continuing to meet the condition that  he
         is exercising treaty rights in the host member state.

17. The panel went on in paragraph [74] to cite with approval  the  opinion
    of Advocate General Kokott in Teixeira  (European  citizenship)  [2009]
    EWECJ C-480/08 as follows:

         Contrary  to  the  view  taken  by  some  of  the  parties  at  the
         proceedings, the exercise of a right of access to education cannot,
         therefore, in any  way  be  predicated  on  the  child's  retention
         throughout the period of its education  of  its  special  right  of
         residence under Article 10(1)(a) of Regulation no.1612/68, and thus
         on its continuing right to settle with a parent who  is  a  migrant
         worker.  If that were not the  case,  children  of  former  migrant
         workers in particular, would for the most part lose  the  right  of
         access to education under Article 12, since  the  parent  who  'has
         been employed' in the host member state will frequently  have  left
         that state after having been employed there, and it will  therefore
         no longer be possible for that parent simply to live with the child
         in a common family home.

18. The significance of this passage is that the claimant did not  have  to
    show that the claimant's father was even in  the  United  Kingdom,  let
    alone exercising treaty rights in the United Kingdom, at  the  date  of
    Julia's entry into formal education.

19.  Finally,  the  panel  noted  at  paragraph  [77]  that  there  was   a
    governmental concession acknowledging that the child did not have to be
    in education at a time when the EEA national parent was working in  the
    UK.  This was made by the DWP in the context of the Czop litigation.

Notice of Decision

20. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not  contain  an  error  of
    law, and accordingly the decision stands.   The  Secretary  of  State's
    appeal to the Upper Tribunal is dismissed.

Anonymity

No anonymity direction made.
