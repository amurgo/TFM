Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr P. Duffy, Home Office Presenting Officer.
For the Respondent:    Ms K. Joshi, Legal Representative, instructed by A.
                    Bajwa & Co. Solicitors.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant (referred to as "the SSHD") appeals against the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal (FTT), promulgated on 26 June 2017, in which
    FTT Judge Frankish allowed the appeal by  the  Respondent  (Mr  Folkes)
    under section 82(1) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002
    ("NIAA 2002") against the SSHD's decision to deport him and  to  refuse
    his human rights claim, dated 9 September  2016.  FTT  Judge  Robertson
    granted the SSHD permission to appeal on 19 July 2017.

 2. Mr Folkes is a Jamaican national who has been living in  the  UK  since
    2001. He has an adult daughter in Jamaica  and  he  has  fathered  four
    children in the UK from three different relationships. On 6 July  2007,
    Mr Folkes was convicted of rape, and sentenced to 6 years imprisonment.
     This sentence triggered the automatic deportation provisions in the UK
    Borders Act 2007 ("UKBA 2007").


 3. The main issues in the appeal were:


        i. the approach which the Tribunal should adopt to the SSHD's fresh
           decision to deport Mr Folkes given that, at an earlier appeal in
           2010, the Upper Tribunal  had  held  that  the  exception  under
           section 33(2)(a) UKBA 2007 applied and it would be in breach  of
           article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights ("ECHR") to
           deport him;  and


       ii. whether the FTT failed to apply  correctly  the  test  of  "very
           compelling circumstances" which outweighed the  public  interest
           in  deportation,  as  set  out  in  paragraph  398(a)   of   the
           Immigration Rules and section 117C(6) NIAA 2002, when  assessing
           Mr Folkes' changed family circumstances.


    Facts


   4. Mr Folkes, whose date of birth is 12 November 1975, is  now  aged  41.
      He was born and brought up in Jamaica, by his mother, who was a single
      parent.  They were poor, and so he had to work part-time from a  young
      age, and he had a limited education.  He left  home  at  age  16,  and
      later worked as a miner. At the date of his  application,  his  mother
      was still alive and living in Jamaica.  He has a  brother  there  too.
      He also fathered a daughter in Jamaica, and though he placed no weight
      on that relationship, the FTT found that "he clearly has a  degree  of
      relationship with his daughter in Jamaica as he knew that  she  is  24
      and self-sufficient".


   5. On 9 December 2001, he entered the UK as a visitor on a 6 month  visa,
      when he was aged 26.  He applied for leave to remain as a  student  on
      20 May 2002, but the application was rejected on 13 June 2002, and  he
      remained in the UK without leave.


   6. Between about January 2002 and November 2002, he was in a relationship
      with [TB]. Their son, [TF], was born on [ ] 2003, and is now aged 14.


   7. In July 2002, he met [LW], a British citizen.  They became engaged  in
      April 2003, and  they  married  on  15  November  2003.   [LW]  had  a
      daughter, [D], from a previous relationship who was born in  September
      1993, who became Mr Folkes' step-daughter.  She is now aged 24.


   8. On 11 March 2004, he applied for leave to remain as the  spouse  of  a
      settled person.  The application was refused, but on 16 November  2005
      he was granted three years discretionary leave  to  remain,  until  16
      November 2008.


   9. On [ ] 2005, [LW] gave birth to their son, [RF], who is now  aged  12.
      He is a British citizen.


  10. In August 2006, Mr Folkes had an affair with a woman which lasted  for
      4 to 5 weeks.


  11. On 27 October 2006 he was arrested, after raping a woman whom  he  was
      visiting at her home. On 6 July 2007, he  was  convicted  of  rape  at
      Harrow Crown  Court  and  sentenced  to  6  years  imprisonment.   His
      custodial term ended on 24 May 2010, but he was  held  in  immigration
      detention until 10 October 2010.


  12. On 10 May 2010, the SSHD notified him that automatic deportation would
      take effect, as the statutory exceptions did not apply to his case.  A
      deportation order was served upon him.


  13. On 11 May 2010, he appealed to the FTT. His appeal was dismissed on 10
      June 2010, on the basis that the interference with family life  caused
      by deportation would not be disproportionate to the legitimate aim  of
      preventing disorder and crime.


  14. On 2 July 2010, he was granted  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
      Tribunal. In a decision promulgated on 24 September  2010,  the  Upper
      Tribunal allowed his appeal, holding that it would be disproportionate
      to deport him on the basis of the article  8  rights  of  his  family,
      namely, his wife [LW], his stepdaughter [D], his son [R], and his  son
      [T].


  15.  After  his  successful  appeal,  he  was  released  from  immigration
      detention, and went to live in a hostel.  He did not  return  to  live
      with his wife [LW].  He left her after discovering that she  had  been
      in a relationship with another man whilst he was in  prison.   He  has
      had intermittent contact with her and the children since then.  At one
      stage he maintained fortnightly contact with the children but  by  the
      date of the FTT hearing, he had not seen the children for  3ï¿½  months,
      because of a breakdown in his relationship with [LW], and  he  thought
      he would need to apply for a court order in order to see them. By  the
      date of the appeal before us, some 4 months later,  the  position  had
      not changed. He had not had contact with the children for many  months
      and believed he would not be able to resume contact  without  a  court
      order.  At the date of the hearing before us, he had not applied for a
      court order.


  16. In about March 2011, Mr Folkes began a relationship with [DF], whom he
      knew from Jamaica. She is a Jamaican national with indefinite leave to
      remain in the UK.  On [ ] 2012, [DF] gave birth to their son, [L], who
      is now aged 5.  He is a British citizen. [DF] has two  children,  aged
      13 and 9, whose father sees them "when he feels like it" according  to
      her evidence to the FTT.  At the hearing before us, at which [DF]  was
      present, it was confirmed that the two older children had  no  regular
      contact with their father.


  17. On [ ] 2012, his wife [LW] gave birth to their daughter  [R],  who  is
      now aged 4. She is a British citizen.   Despite  the  birth  of  their
      child, Mr Folkes insisted at the  FTT  hearing,  and  at  the  hearing
      before us, that his marriage had broken down in 2010.


  18. Following the decision of the Upper  Tribunal,  the  SSHD  granted  Mr
      Folkes discretionary leave to remain but only for periods of 6  months
      at a time. He was granted leave on 22 October 2010; 15 July  2011  and
      25 November 2013.   On 9 May 2014, Mr Folkes submitted an  application
      for a further period of leave, without disclosing the changes  in  his
      family circumstances.


  19. On 15 June 2015, he was served with a notice of intention  to  deport,
      based upon the conviction in  July  2007.   His  solicitors  submitted
      representations on 10 July 2015 setting out reasons why he should  not
      be deported, relying upon the successful appeal to the Upper  Tribunal
      in September 2010.


  20. On 9 September 2016, the SSHD sent  a  decision  letter  refusing  his
      human rights claim,  on  the  grounds  that  the  public  interest  in
      deporting a foreign criminal  outweighed  his  right  to  private  and
      family life, and it would not be unduly harsh for his  wife  [LW]  and
      their children [R] and [R] to relocate to Jamaica with  him,  if  they
      chose to do so.  Mr Folkes would be able to maintain contact with  [T]
      via Skype, email etc., and [T] could visit him.   As  to  his  private
      life, the SSHD noted that he was a self-employed builder who would  be
      able to utilise his skills to obtain work  in  Jamaica,  and  that  he
      would be able to maintain contact with friends in the  UK  via  modern
      means of communication. The application for a further period of  leave
      to remain, submitted on 9 May 2014, was refused in this letter.


  21. The SSHD's notice of intention to deport and the decision letter of  9
      September 2016 were based upon the false assumption  that  Mr  Folkes'
      family circumstances had not changed, and his marriage with  [LW]  was
      subsisting.  The SSHD was unaware of his relationship  with  [DF]  and
      the birth of their son [L].  Mr Folkes' solicitors did  not  refer  to
      the change of circumstances in their written  representations  to  the
      SSHD; we do not know whether they were aware of them.


     Legal framework

     (1) Automatic deportation under the UKBA 2007

22. Under section 32(5) UKBA 2007, the SSHD must automatically deport, as a
    "foreign criminal", a person who is not a  British  citizen,  following
    conviction for a criminal offence for which he has been sentenced to 12
    months imprisonment or more, unless he falls within the  exceptions  in
    section 33.


  23. By section  33(2)(a),  automatic  deportation  does  not  apply  where
      removal under a deportation order would breach a  person's  Convention
      rights.


  24. Section 32(4) UKBA 2007 provides that,  for  the  purpose  of  section
      3(5)(a) of the Immigration Act 1971,  the  deportation  of  a  foreign
      criminal is conducive to the public good.  By section  33(7),  section
      32(4) continues to  apply,  despite  the  application  of  section  33
      exceptions.

    (2) Article 8 ECHR


  25. By virtue of section 6(1) of the Human Rights Act 1998, it is unlawful
      for a public authority to act in a way which is  incompatible  with  a
      Convention right.


  26. Mr Folkes claimed that his removal would be in breach of the "right to
      respect for private and family life" under article 8(1) ECHR.  Article
      8(2) provides:

      "There shall be  no  interference  by  a  public  authority  with  the
           exercise of this right except such as in accordance with the law
           and is necessary in a democratic society  in  the  interests  of
           national security, public safety or the economic  well-being  of
           the country, for the prevention of disorder or  crime,  for  the
           protection of health or morals, or for  the  protection  of  the
           rights and freedoms of others."


    (3) Best interests of children


  27. By virtue of section 55 of the Borders,  Citizenship  and  Immigration
      Act 2009, in making decisions  on  deportation,  the  SSHD  must  have
      regard to the need to safeguard and promote the  welfare  of  children
      who are in the UK.

  28. The House of Lords, in ZH (Tanzania) v Home Secretary [2011] 2 AC 166,
      held that, in the application of article  8(2),  the  children's  best
      interests should be treated as  "a  primary  consideration",  to  give
      effect to art. 3.1 of the UN Convention on the Rights  of  the  Child.
      Nationality and the rights of citizenship are of particular importance
      in assessing the best interests of any  child.   Thus,  the  decision-
      maker must ask whether it is reasonable to expect the child to live in
      another country, and to be deprived of the opportunity to exercise the
      rights of a British citizen.  However, even if it is found  to  be  in
      the best interests of the child to remain in the UK, that  factor  can
      be outweighed by the strength of  "countervailing  considerations"  in
      favour of removal (per Lady Hale at [29] - [33]).


  29. In Zoumbas v Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2013]  UKSC
      74, Lord Hodge, delivering the judgment of the Court,  summarised  the
      principles to be applied, at [10]:


           "(1) The best interests of a child are an integral part  of  the
              proportionality assessment under article 8 ECHR;


           (2) In making that assessment, the best  interests  of  a  child
              must be a primary consideration, although not always the only
              primary consideration; and the child's best interests do  not
              of themselves have the status of the paramount consideration;


           (3)    Although the best interests of a child can be  outweighed
              by the cumulative effect of other  considerations,  no  other
              consideration can be treated as inherently more significant;


           (4)    While different judges might approach the question of the
              best interests of a child in different ways, it is  important
              to ask oneself the right questions in an  orderly  manner  in
              order to avoid the risk that the best interests  of  a  child
              might be undervalued when other important considerations were
              in play;


           (5)    It is important  to  have  a  clear  idea  of  a  child's
              circumstances and of what is  in  a  child's  best  interests
              before  one  asks  oneself  whether   those   interests   are
              outweighed by the force of other considerations;


           (6)    To  that  end  there  is  no  substitute  for  a  careful
              examination of all relevant factors when the interests  of  a
              child are involved in an article 8 assessment; and


           (7)    A child must not be blamed for matters for  which  he  or
              she is not responsible, such as the conduct of a parent."


(4) Sections 117A - D NIAA 2002

  30. Since 28 July 2014, sections 117A-D NIAA  2002  have  set  out  public
      interest considerations which a  court  or  tribunal  must  take  into
      account in an appeal based upon article 8:



           "117A Application of this Part

           (1) This Part applies where a court or tribunal is  required  to
           determine whether a decision made under the Immigration Acts-


              (a) breaches a person's right  to  respect  for  private  and
              family life under Article 8, and


              (b) as a result would be unlawful  under  section  6  of  the
              Human Rights Act 1998.


           (2) In considering the public interest question,  the  court  or
           tribunal must (in particular) have regard-


              (a) in all cases, to the  considerations  listed  in  section
              117B, and


              (b) in cases concerning the deportation of foreign criminals,
              to the considerations listed in section 117C.


           (3) In subsection (2), "the public interest question" means  the
           question of whether an interference with  a  person's  right  to
           respect for private and family life is justified  under  Article
           8(2).



           117B Article 8: public interest considerations applicable in all
           cases

           (1) The maintenance of effective immigration controls is in  the
           public interest.


           (2) It is in the public  interest,  and  in  particular  in  the
           interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that
           persons who seek to enter or remain in the  United  Kingdom  are
           able to speak English, because persons who can speak English-


              (a) are less of a burden on taxpayers, and


              (b) are better able to integrate into society.


           (3) It is in the public  interest,  and  in  particular  in  the
           interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that
           persons who seek to enter or remain in the  United  Kingdom  are
           financially independent, because such persons-


              (a) are not a burden on taxpayers, and


              (b) are better able to integrate into society.


           (4) Little weight should be given to-


              (a) a private life, or


              (b) a relationship formed with a qualifying partner,


           that is established by a person at a time when the person is  in
           the United Kingdom unlawfully.


           (5) Little weight should be given to a private life  established
           by a person at a time when the person's  immigration  status  is
           precarious.


           (6) In the case of a person who is not  liable  to  deportation,
           the public interest does not require the person's removal where-


              (a)  the  person  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting   parental
              relationship with a qualifying child, and


              (b) it would not be reasonable to expect the child  to  leave
              the United Kingdom.


           117C Article 8: additional  considerations  in  cases  involving
           foreign criminals


           (1) The deportation  of  foreign  criminals  is  in  the  public
           interest.


           (2)  The  more  serious  the  offence  committed  by  a  foreign
           criminal, the greater is the public interest in  deportation  of
           the criminal.


           (3) In the case of a foreign criminal ("C")  who  has  not  been
           sentenced to a period of imprisonment of four years or more, the
           public interest requires C's deportation unless Exception  1  or
           Exception 2 applies.


           (4) Exception 1 applies where-


              (a) C has been lawfully resident in the  United  Kingdom  for
              most of C's life,


              (b) C is socially and culturally  integrated  in  the  United
              Kingdom, and


              (c)  there  would  be  very  significant  obstacles  to   C's
              integration into the country to which C  is  proposed  to  be
              deported.


           (5) Exception 2 applies where C has  a  genuine  and  subsisting
           relationship  with  a  qualifying  partner,  or  a  genuine  and
           subsisting parental relationship with a  qualifying  child,  and
           the effect of C's deportation on the partner or child  would  be
           unduly harsh.


           (6) In the case of a foreign criminal who has been sentenced  to
           a period of imprisonment of at  least  four  years,  the  public
           interest requires deportation unless there are  very  compelling
           circumstances, over and above those described  in  Exceptions  1
           and 2.


           (7) The considerations in subsections (1) to (6) are to be taken
           into account where a court or tribunal is considering a decision
           to deport a foreign criminal only to the extent that the  reason
           for the decision was the  offence  or  offences  for  which  the
           criminal has been convicted.





           117D Interpretation of this Part

           (1) In this Part-


              "Article 8" means Article 8 of  the  European  Convention  on
              Human Rights;


              "qualifying child" means a person who is under the age of  18
              and who-


              (a) is a British citizen, or


              (b) has lived in the United Kingdom for a  continuous  period
              of seven years or more;


              "qualifying partner" means a partner who-


              (a) is a British citizen, or


              (b) who is settled in the United Kingdom (within the  meaning
              of the Immigration Act 1971 -  see  section  33(2A)  of  that
              Act).


           (2) In this Part, "foreign criminal" means a person-


              (a) who is not a British citizen,


              (b) who has been  convicted  in  the  United  Kingdom  of  an
              offence, and


              (c) who-


                  (i) has been sentenced to a period of imprisonment of  at
                  least 12 months,


                  (ii) has been convicted of an  offence  that  has  caused
                  serious harm, or


                  (iii) is a persistent offender.


           (3) ......
           (4) ......
           (5) ......"

    (5) Immigration Rules

  31. The considerations set out in section 117C NIAA 2002 are reflected  in
      the Immigration Rules (last amended 10 August 2017) which provide,  so
      far as is material:


           "Deportation and Article 8





           A398. These rules apply where:


              (a) a foreign criminal liable to deportation claims that  his
              deportation  would  be  contrary  to  the  United   Kingdom's
              obligations under Article 8 of the Human Rights Convention;


              (b) ....


           398. Where a person  claims  that  their  deportation  would  be
           contrary to the UK's obligations under Article 8  of  the  Human
           Rights Convention, and


              (a) the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive to
              the public good and in the public interest because they  have
              been convicted  of  an  offence  for  which  they  have  been
              sentenced to a period of imprisonment of at least 4 years;


              (b) the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive to
              the public good and in the public interest because they  have
              been convicted  of  an  offence  for  which  they  have  been
              sentenced to a period of imprisonment of less  than  4  years
              but at least 12 months; or


              (c) the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive to
              the public good and in the public interest  because,  in  the
              view of the Secretary of State, their  offending  has  caused
              serious harm or they are a persistent offender  who  shows  a
              particular disregard for the law,


           the Secretary of State in assessing  that  claim  will  consider
           whether paragraph 399 or 399A applies and, if it does  not,  the
           public interest in deportation will only be outweighed by  other
           factors where there are very compelling circumstances  over  and
           above those described in paragraphs 399 and 399A.


           399. This paragraph applies  where  paragraph  398  (b)  or  (c)
           applies if -


              (a)  the  person  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting   parental
              relationship with a child under the age of 18 years who is in
              the UK, and


                  (i) the child is a British Citizen; or


                  (ii) the child has lived in the UK  continuously  for  at
                  least the 7 years immediately preceding the date  of  the
                  immigration decision; and in either case


                       (a) it would be unduly harsh for the child to live in
                       the country to which the person is  to  be  deported;
                       and


                       (b) it would be unduly harsh for the child to  remain
                       in the UK without the person who is to  be  deported;
                       or


              (b) the person has a genuine and subsisting relationship with
              a partner who is in the  UK  and  is  a  British  Citizen  or
              settled in the UK, and


                  (i) the relationship was formed at a time when the person
                  (deportee) was in the UK lawfully and  their  immigration
                  status was not precarious; and


                  (ii) it would be unduly harsh for that partner to live in
                  the country to  which  the  person  is  to  be  deported,
                  because of compelling circumstances over and above  those
                  described in paragraph EX.2. of Appendix FM; and


                  (iii) it would be unduly harsh for that partner to remain
                  in the UK without the person who is to be deported.


           399A. This paragraph  applies  where  paragraph  398(b)  or  (c)
           applies if -


              (a) the person has been lawfully resident in the UK for  most
              of his life; and


              (b) he is socially and culturally integrated in the UK; and


              (c)  there  would  be  very  significant  obstacles  to   his
              integration into the country to which it is  proposed  he  is
              deported.


           399B. Where an Article  8  claim  from  a  foreign  criminal  is
           successful:


              (a) in the case of a person who is in the  UK  unlawfully  or
              whose leave to enter  or  remain  has  been  cancelled  by  a
              deportation order, limited leave may be granted  for  periods
              not exceeding 30 months and subject to such conditions as the
              Secretary of State considers appropriate;


              (b) in the case of a person who has not been  served  with  a
              deportation order, any limited leave to enter or  remain  may
              be  curtailed  to  a  period  not  exceeding  30  months  and
              conditions may be varied to such conditions as the  Secretary
              of State considers appropriate;


              (c) indefinite leave to enter or remain may be revoked  under
              section 76 of the 2002 Act and  limited  leave  to  enter  or
              remain granted for a period not exceeding 30  months  subject
              to such  conditions  as  the  Secretary  of  State  considers
              appropriate;


              (d) revocation of a deportation order does not  confer  entry
              clearance or leave to  enter  or  remain  or  re-instate  any
              previous leave.


           399C. Where a foreign criminal who has previously been granted a
           period of limited leave under  this  Part  applies  for  further
           limited leave or indefinite  leave  to  remain  his  deportation
           remains conducive to the public good and in the public  interest
           notwithstanding the previous grant of leave."

    (6) Application of the legislation and the Immigration Rules


  32. In Hesham Ali (Iraq) v Secretary of  State  for  the  Home  Department
      [2016] UKSC 60, the Supreme Court held that the Immigration Rules  are
      not a complete code which  exhaustively  governs  the  decision-making
      process; to that extent MF (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ  1192  (per  Lord
      Dyson at [44]) was mistaken or misunderstood.  They  were  a  relevant
      and   important   consideration   in   the   tribunal's   article    8
      proportionality assessment (per Lord Reed at  [53]).  However,  Hesham
      Ali's case pre-dated the introduction of sections  117A-D  NIAA  2002,
      and so these provisions were not considered by the Supreme Court.


  33. In NE-A (Nigeria) v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2017]
      EWCA Civ 239, the Court of Appeal distinguished between the status and
      effect of the Immigration Rules  and  the  legislative  provisions  in
      sections 117A-D NIAA 2002.  Sir Stephen Richards said, at  [14],  that
      sections 117A-D NIAA 2002 were intended to provide  for  a  structured
      approach to the application of article 8 which would  produce  in  all
      cases a final result which was compatible with article 8, if  properly
      applied. This was also the agreed starting point before the  Court  of
      Appeal in Ruppiah v  Secretary of State for the Home Department [2016]
      EWCA Civ 803 (per Sales LJ at [45]).


  34. The approach which tribunals should now adopt was helpfully  described
      by Hickinbottom LJ giving the judgment  of  the  Court  of  Appeal  in
      Secretary of State for the Home Department v KE (Nigeria) [2017]  EWCA
      Civ 1382, at [30] to [36]:


            "30. The statutory provisions in sections 117A-117D are law (cf
           the Immigration Rules: see Ali at [17]). However,  both  section
           117C and the relevant Immigration Rules set out policy,  in  the
           sense  that  they  provide   a   general   assessment   of   the
           proportionality exercise that has to be performed under  article
           8(2) where there is a public interest  in  deporting  a  foreign
           criminal but countervailing article 8 factors. The force of  the
           assessment in section 117C is, of course, the greater because it
           directly  reflects  the  will  of  Parliament.   The   statutory
           provisions thus provide  a  "particularly  strong  statement  of
           public policy" (NA (Pakistan) at [22]), such that "great weight"
           should generally be given to it and cases in which  that  public
           interest will be outweighed, other than those specified  in  the
           statutory provisions and Rules themselves, "are likely to  be  a
           very small minority (particular in non-settled cases)"  (Ali  at
           [38]), i.e. will be rare (NA (Pakistan) at [33]).


           31. But the  required,  heavily  structured  analysis  does  not
           eradicate all judgment on the part of the decision-maker and, in
           its turn, the  court  or  tribunal  on  any  challenge  to  that
           decision-maker's decision. It is  well-established,  and  indeed
           self-evident, that relative human rights (such as the  right  to
           respect for family and private life under article  8)  can  only
           ultimately be considered on the facts of  the  particular  case.
           The structured approach towards the article 8(2) proportionality
           balancing exercise required by the 2002 Act and the  Immigration
           Rules does not determine the outcome of  the  assessment  in  an
           individual case.


           32. Whether an exception in paragraph 399  or  399A  applies  is
           dependent upon questions that require case-specific  evaluation,
           such as whether in all of the  circumstances  it  would  not  be
           reasonable for a child to leave the United Kingdom or whether in
           all of the circumstances there are insurmountable  obstacles  to
           family life outside the United Kingdom.


           33. More importantly for the purposes of this appeal,  where  an
           offender  has  been  sentenced   to   at   least   four   years'
           imprisonment, or otherwise falls outside the paragraph  399  and
           399A exceptions, the decision-maker, court or tribunal entrusted
           with the task must still consider and assess whether  there  are
           "very compelling circumstances" that justify  a  departure  from
           the general rule that such offenders should be deported  in  the
           public interest. That requires the decision-maker to  take  into
           account, not only that  general  assessment  (and  give  it  the
           weight appropriate to such an assessment  made  by  Parliament),
           but also the facts and  circumstances  of  the  particular  case
           which are not - indeed, cannot - be taken into  account  in  any
           general assessment. As Lord Reed, giving the majority  judgment,
           said in Ali :


               "49. ... It is necessary to feed into the analysis the facts
               of  the  particular  case  and  the   criteria   which   are
               appropriate to the context, and, where a court is  reviewing
               the decision of another authority, to give  such  weight  to
               the judgment of that authority as  may  be  appropriate.  In
               that way, relevant differences between, for  example,  cases
               where lawfully settled migrants are  facing  deportation  or
               expulsion, and cases where an alien is seeking admission  to
               a host country, can be taken into account.


               50. In summary, therefore, the tribunal carries out its task
               on the basis of the facts as it finds  them  to  be  on  the
               evidence before it, and the law as  established  by  statute
               and  case  law.  Ultimately,  it  has  to   decide   whether
               deportation is proportionate in the particular  case  before
               it, balancing the strength of the  public  interest  in  the
               deportation of the offender against the  impact  on  private
               and family life. In doing so,  it  should  give  appropriate
               weight  to  Parliament's  and  the  Secretary   of   State's
               assessments of the strength of the general  public  interest
               in  the  deportation  of  foreign  offenders...,  and   also
               consider all  factors  relevant  to  the  specific  case  in
               question. The critical issue for the tribunal will generally
               be whether, giving due weight to the strength of the  public
               interest on deportation of the offender in the  case  before
               it, the article 8 claim is sufficiently strong  to  outweigh
               it. In general, only a claim which is very strong  indeed  -
               very compelling, as it was put  in  [MF  (Nigeria)]  -  will
               succeed."


           See also [53] to similar effect.


           34. Therefore, as Lord Reed emphasises, whatever the seriousness
           of the offences or length of sentence, the ultimate question  is
           the same - would deportation be in breach of article 8 - but the
           sentence  imposed  affects  the  approach  to  the  exercise  of
           assessing proportionality for article 8(2) purposes. If it is at
           least four years' imprisonment, any decision-maker  must  attach
           very considerable weight to the general assessment of the public
           interest in deporting foreign criminals, now directly adopted by
           Parliament in statute, under which such a sentence represents  a
           level of offending in  respect  of  which  the  public  interest
           almost always outweighs countervailing considerations of private
           or family life, only being outweighed by countervailing  factors
           which are very compelling (see Ali at [46]). Where  there  is  a
           challenge to a decision involving  the  article  8(2)  balancing
           exercise by a decision-maker on behalf of the Secretary of State
           in an individual case, as I have already described, the court or
           tribunal must give that general assessment  substantial  weight,
           because it is endorsed by Parliament; and it must also take into
           account - but no more than take into account -  the  application
           of that general assessment to the facts of the specific case  by
           the  original  decision-maker  (OH  (Serbia)  at  [15(d)]).   As
           independent judicial  bodies,  on  hearing  a  challenge  to  an
           executive decision in an individual case, it is the duty of  the
           court or tribunal to make its own findings of the relevant facts
           and then make its own assessment of the proportionality  of  the
           proposed deportation (Ali at [46]).


           35. Since Ali, the 2014 Act has  intervened,  encapsulating  the
           relevant  Government  policy  in  statute  rather  than   merely
           Immigration Rules. However,  in  my  view,  the  principles  and
           approach expounded  by  Lord  Reed  still  apply;  although,  in
           considering the appropriate weight to be given the assessment of
           the strength of the general public interest in  the  deportation
           of foreign offenders,  any  decision-maker,  court  or  tribunal
           conducting the article 8(2) exercise has to bear  in  mind  that
           that is  now  incorporated  into  statute,  and  so,  even  more
           starkly, reflects the will of Parliament.


           36. In NA (Pakistan) at [37], Jackson LJ considered the  correct
           approach to a case in which section  117C(6)  ("very  compelling
           circumstances") applies:


               "... [I]t will often be sensible first to  see  whether  his
               case  involves  circumstances  of  the  kind  described   in
               Exceptions 1  and  2,  both  because  the  circumstances  so
               described set out particularly significant  factors  bearing
               upon respect for private life (Exception 1) and respect  for
               family life (Exception 2) and because  that  may  provide  a
               helpful basis on which an assessment  can  be  made  whether
               there are 'very compelling  circumstances,  over  and  above
               those described in Exceptions 1 and 2' as is required  under
               section 117C(6). It will then be necessary to  look  to  see
               whether any of the factors falling within the  Exceptions  1
               and 2 are of such force, whether by themselves or  taken  in
               conjunction with any other relevant factors not  covered  by
               the circumstances described in Exceptions 1  and  2,  as  to
               satisfy the test in section 117C(6)."


              I respectfully commend such an approach."


  35. We have also borne in mind the guidance given  by  Jackson  LJ  in  NA
      (Pakistan) [2016] EWCA Civ 662, at [38] - [39]:


           "38. Against that background, one may ask what is  the  role  of
           the Strasbourg jurisprudence? In particular, how does  one  take
           into account important decisions  such  as  ?ner  v  Netherlands
           (2007) 45 EHRR 14 and Maslov  v  Austria?  Mr  Southey  QC,  who
           represents KJ  and  WM,  rightly  submits  that  the  Strasbourg
           authorities have an important  role  to  play.  Mr  Tam  rightly
           accepted that this is correct. The answer is that the  Secretary
           of State and the tribunals and courts will have  regard  to  the
           Strasbourg jurisprudence when applying the tests set out in  our
           domestic legislation. For example, a tribunal may be considering
           whether it would be "unduly harsh" for  a  child  to  remain  in
           England without the deportee; or it may be  considering  whether
           certain circumstances are sufficiently "compelling" to  outweigh
           the high public interest in deportation  of  foreign  criminals.
           Anyone applying these tests (as required by our  own  rules  and
           legislation)  should  heed  the  guidance   contained   in   the
           Strasbourg authorities. As we have stated above, the  scheme  of
           Part 5A of the 2002 Act and paras. 398-399A of the 2014 rules is
           to ensure compliance with the requirements of Article 8  through
           a structured approach, which is intended to ensure  that  proper
           weight is given to the public  interest  in  deportation  whilst
           also having regard to other relevant factors  as  identified  in
           the Strasbourg and domestic  caselaw.  The  new  regime  is  not
           intended to produce violations of Article 8.


           39. Even then it must be borne in mind  that  assessments  under
           Article 8 may not  lead  to  identical  results  in  every  ECHR
           contracting state. To the degree allowed  under  the  margin  of
           appreciation and bearing in mind that the ECHR  is  intended  to
           reflect  a  fair  balance  between  individual  rights  and  the
           interests of the  general  community,  an  individual  state  is
           entitled to assess the public interest which  may  be  in  issue
           when it comes to deportation of foreign criminals and to  decide
           what weight to attach to it in the particular  circumstances  of
           its society. Different states may make different assessments  of
           what weight  should  be  attached  to  the  public  interest  in
           deportation of foreign offenders.  In  England  and  Wales,  the
           weight to be attached to the public interest in  deportation  of
           foreign offenders has been  underlined  by  successive  specific
           legislative interventions: first by enactment of the  2007  Act,
           then by promulgation of the code in the 2012 rules  and  now  by
           the introduction of further primary legislation in the  form  of
           Part 5A of the 2002 Act and the new  code  in  the  2014  rules.
           Statute requires that in carrying out Article 8  assessments  in
           relation to foreign criminals the decision-maker must  recognise
           that the deportation of foreign criminals is "conducive  to  the
           public good" (per section 32(4) of the 2007  Act)  and  "in  the
           public interest" (per section 117C(1) of the 2014 Act)."


  36. Thus, the case law of the ECtHR remains relevant to the issues  to  be
      considered by the tribunal  under  section  117C  NIAA  2002  and  the
      Immigration Rules.  In Hesham Ali, Lord Reed reviewed the case law  of
      the ECtHR on whether the deportation of a foreign  offender  would  be
      incompatible with article 8 rights:


           "25. The question whether the deportation of a foreign  offender
           would be incompatible with article 8 has been considered by  the
           European  court  in  numerous  judgments.  In  cases  concerning
           "settled migrants", that is to say persons who have been granted
           a right of residence in the host country, the court has accepted
           that the withdrawal of that right may constitute an interference
           with the right to respect for private and/or family life  within
           the meaning of article 8. If there is an interference,  it  must
           be justified under article 8(2) as being "in accordance with the
           law", as pursuing one or more of the legitimate aims set out  in
           that  paragraph,  and  as  being  "necessary  in  a   democratic
           society", that is to say justified by a pressing social need and
           proportionate to the  legitimate  aim  pursued.  The  court  has
           treated the legitimate aim pursued by deportation, on the  basis
           of  a  person's  conviction  of  a  criminal  offence,  as   the
           "prevention of disorder or crime" (although  there  are  also  a
           small number of cases in which public safety has  been  accepted
           to be an additional aim): see, for example, AA v United  Kingdom
           [2012] Imm AR 107, paras 53-54. In practice, the critical  issue
           is generally whether  the  "necessity"  test  is  met.  In  that
           regard, the court has often said that the task of the  court  or
           tribunal applying article 8(2) consists in ascertaining  whether
           the  decision  struck  a  fair  balance  between  the   relevant
           interests, namely the  applicant's  right  to  respect  for  his
           private and family life, on the one hand, and the prevention  of
           disorder or crime, on the other.


           26. In a well-known series of judgments the court  has  set  out
           the guiding principles  which  it  applies  when  assessing  the
           likelihood that the  deportation  of  a  settled  migrant  would
           interfere with family life and, if so,  its  proportionality  to
           the legitimate aim pursued. In Boultif v Switzerland  (2001)  33
           EHRR 50, para 48, the court said  that  it  would  consider  the
           nature  and  seriousness  of  the  offence  committed   by   the
           applicant; the length of the applicant's  stay  in  the  country
           from which he or she is to be expelled; the time  elapsed  since
           the offence was committed and  the  applicant's  conduct  during
           that period; the nationalities of the various persons concerned;
           the applicant's family situation, such  as  the  length  of  the
           marriage, and other factors expressing the  effectiveness  of  a
           couple's family life; whether the spouse knew about the  offence
           at the time when he or she entered into a  family  relationship;
           whether there are children of the marriage,  and  if  so,  their
           age; and the seriousness of the difficulties which the spouse is
           likely to encounter in the country to which the applicant is  to
           be expelled. Two  further  factors  were  mentioned  in  ?ner  v
           Netherlands (2006) 45 EHRR 14, para 58: the best  interests  and
           well-being of the children, in particular the seriousness of the
           difficulties which any children of the applicant are  likely  to
           encounter in the  country  to  which  the  applicant  is  to  be
           expelled; and the solidity of the social,  cultural  and  family
           ties with the host country and with the country of  destination.
           In Maslov v Austria [2009] INLR 47, paras 72-75, the court added
           that the age of the  person  concerned  can  play  a  role  when
           applying some of these criteria. For  instance,  when  assessing
           the nature and seriousness of the offences, it has to  be  taken
           into account whether the person committed them as a juvenile  or
           as an adult. Equally, when assessing the length of the  person's
           stay in the country from which he or she is to be  expelled  and
           the solidity of the social, cultural and family  ties  with  the
           host country, it makes a difference whether the person  came  to
           the country during his or her childhood or youth,  or  was  even
           born there, or whether he or she only came as an adult. Some  of
           the factors listed in these cases relate to the strength of  the
           public interest in deportation: that is to say,  the  extent  to
           which the deportation of the person concerned will  promote  the
           legitimate aim pursued. Others relate to  the  strength  of  the
           countervailing interests in private and family  life.  They  are
           not exhaustive.


             ...


           29 Where children are involved, their best interests are said by
           the court to be of paramount importance (by which  it  does  not
           mean to say that they  are  determinative:  see  Jeunesse,  para
           109). Whilst  alone  they  cannot  be  decisive,  they  must  be
           afforded significant  weight.  Accordingly,  national  decision-
           making bodies should in principle advert to and assess  evidence
           in respect of the practicality, feasibility and  proportionality
           of any removal  of  a  non-national  parent  in  order  to  give
           effective protection and sufficient weight to the best interests
           of the children directly affected by it  (Jeunesse,  paras  108-
           109)."




    Issue 1: the effect of the Upper Tribunal's decision in 2010

  37. Mr Folkes submitted that the SSHD was not entitled  to  make  a  fresh
      deportation order because she was bound by the  determination  of  the
      Upper Tribunal in 2010 which held that deportation  would  breach  the
      article 8 rights of his family members. He submitted that  the  issues
      were  settled  by  the  previous  determination:  see  Devaseelan   v.
      Secretary of State for the Home Department [2002]  UKAIT  00702.   The
      doctrine of res judicata applied.


  38. The SSHD submitted that she was entitled  to  make  a  fresh  decision
      because the  law  had  changed  since  the  Upper  Tribunal  made  its
      determination in 2010.  Further or  in  the  alternative,  Mr  Folkes'
      personal circumstances had changed and  so,  applying  the  principles
      established in Devaseelan, the previous determination was  merely  the
      starting point, and the application of article 8 had to be assessed on
      the basis of the changed circumstances.


  39. In our judgment, the FTT was correct to conclude that the SSHD was not
      entitled to disregard the 2010 decision and deport  Mr  Folkes  merely
      because there had been a change in the law since  2010,  but  she  was
      entitled to re-consider his case in the light of  the  change  in  his
      family circumstances.


  40. We agree with the SSHD's submission that the principle of res judicata
      does not mean that a successful appeal against deportation renders  an
      applicant immune from deportation at  a  later  date.   He  remains  a
      "foreign criminal" for the purposes of the UKBA 2007,  as  defined  in
      section 32(1).  Section  32(4)  provides  that,  for  the  purpose  of
      section 3(5)(a) of the Immigration Act  1971,  the  deportation  of  a
      foreign criminal is conducive to the public good.  By  section  33(7),
      section 32(4) continues to apply, despite the application  of  section
      33 exceptions.


41. The same principle underlies paragraph 399C of the  Immigration  Rules
    which provides that where a foreign criminal who has  previously  been
    granted a period of limited leave applies for further limited leave or
    indefinite leave to remain his deportation remains  conducive  to  the
    public good and in the public interest  notwithstanding  the  previous
    grant of leave.


  42. In Hesham Ali (Iraq) v Secretary of  State  for  the  Home  Department
      [2016] UKSC 60, Lord Reed (giving a majority  judgment)  explained  at
      [12], that the likely explanation for the  deportation  of  a  foreign
      criminal continuing to be conducive to the public good, even where  it
      has been held that removal would breach  his  Convention  rights,  was
      that the circumstances which may render deportation incompatible  with
      the Convention may be temporary.  He said:


           "For example, the risk of a breach of article 3 in  the  country
           to which the person would be deported may disappear .... Section
           32(4) keeps open the possibility of automatic deportation  under
           section  32(5)  in  the  event   of   a   material   change   of
           circumstances." (our emphasis)


  43. In our view, such  a  material  change  of  circumstances  could  also
      include a change in the family circumstances which previously led to a
      grant of leave under article 8.


  44. The Upper Tribunal in 2010 made its determination pursuant to the UKBA
      2007 (which provided in section 32(4) that deportation  of  a  foreign
      criminal was conductive to the public  good)  and  article  8.   These
      provisions are still applicable. However, in 2010 the  Upper  Tribunal
      made its article 8 assessment based upon the  case  law,  whereas  now
      there  is  a  structured  decision-making  framework,  in  which  both
      Parliament and the SSHD have set out policy considerations  which  are
      to be applied to the article 8 assessment.  There  has  not  been  any
      statement, whether in law or policy, to suggest  that  decisions  made
      prior to these  changes  ought  to  be  re-considered  under  the  new
      framework, regardless of any material change of circumstances.  In our
      view, this would be a significant departure from usual practice  which
      we would expect to be clearly signalled if it was intended.


  45. We do not consider that  the  change  which  has  taken  place  -  the
      codification of article 8 policy considerations  -  is  sufficient  to
      justify a departure from the well-established principles in Devaseelan
      which were approved by the Court of Appeal in Djebbar v  Secretary  of
      State for the Home Department [2004] EWCA Civ 804.   These  principles
      were affirmed by the Upper Tribunal in AS &  AA  (Effect  of  previous
      linked determination) Somalia [2006] UKAIT 00052, and approved by  the
      Court of Appeal at [2007] EWCA Civ 1040.  Applying those principles to
      this case, the 2010 determination stood unchallenged, as  it  was  not
      successfully appealed by the SSHD (the representatives could not  tell
      us whether the SSHD had sought to appeal or not). As an assessment  of
      the matters that were before the Upper Tribunal in 2010, it should  be
      regarded as unquestioned.  The FTT was not hearing an  appeal  against
      the 2010 decision. The 2010 determination was the appropriate starting
      point.  Thereafter, the FTT was entitled to take into  account  events
      which had occurred since the date of the 2010 determination.   Because
      of the passing of time, and  changes  in  circumstances,  the  outcome
      could legitimately be different.


    Issue 2: whether the FTT failed to apply correctly the test of "very
    compelling circumstances" which outweighed the public interest in
    deportation


  46. After examining the evidence, the  FTT  concluded  that,  although  Mr
      Folkes had developed his private and family life whilst  his  position
      was arguably precarious, it was reasonable for him  to  think  he  was
      "home and dry after his successful determination" in 2010  (at  [29]).
      The FTT Judge said:


           "29. ... I find that the facts, subject to the shifting array of
           personnel,  are  essentially  the  same  as  in  the  successful
           determination. The appellant has avoided any further  crime  and
           gives some evidence of being a hard worker. Seven years on, with
           no real change to the legal (as opposed to  actual)  aspects  of
           the  appellant's   personal   circumstances   (i.e.   subsisting
           relationship,  child   and   contact   arising   from   previous
           relationships), the respondent seeks to pull the rug from  under
           his feet by ceasing his sequential leaves to remain. That she is
           entitled to do under the law but subject to  article  8  rights.
           Nonetheless,  the  last  seven  years   since   the   successful
           determination  demonstrate  additional   social   and   cultural
           integration. Above all, however, this is a case combining  S117C
           very compelling circumstances and an unduly harsh effect on  the
           partner and children. The appellant plays a role in the lives of
           three children by previous relationships. He plays a big role in
           the life of his child by his current relationship. It is  a  not
           inconsiderable factor in the equation that he has been a leading
           a lawful life as a family man during the seven years  since  the
           successful determination. To pull that particular rug  from  his
           feet by reason of changes in the law  amounts,  I  conclude,  to
           circumstances  which  invoke  the  saving  provisions  of   very
           compelling circumstances and unduly harsh effect of partner  and
           children under S117C."


  47. The SSHD submitted that the FTT failed to apply the requisite test  to
      the facts which he found, adopting too low a threshold, and failing to
      identify very compelling circumstances.  The FTT's assessment that his
      circumstances were essentially the same as before, for the purposes of
      article  8,  albeit  "with  a  change  of  personnel",   was   "overly
      simplistic", as the  changes  were  significant.    Although  the  FTT
      recognised that the SSHD was entitled to  re-consider  the  article  8
      claim,  it erred in  characterising  the  SSHD's  decision  to  refuse
      further leave  as unfairly "moving the goalposts"(at  [10]  and  [13])
      and "pulling the rug out from under his feet" (at [29]).


  48. Mr Folkes submitted that the FTT correctly applied the requisite  test
      and was right to find that his deportation would have an unduly  harsh
      effect on his children and current partner [DF], and that  there  were
      very compelling circumstances over and above this which outweighed the
      public interest in deportation.   Ten  years  had  elapsed  since  his
      conviction in May 2007 during which time he had not re-offended and he
      had re-integrated into society.   His private and family life  in  the
      UK had deepened, as he and his partners  expected  that  he  would  be
      allowed to remain in the UK, following his successful appeal in  2010,
      and two further grants of discretionary leave to remain.

  49. The Upper Tribunal in 2010 decided that it would  be  disproportionate
      to deport the Appellant on the basis of the article 8  rights  of  his
      family members - his wife [LW], his step-daughter [D],  and  his  sons
      [R] and [T].


  50. However, the Upper Tribunal in 2010 proceeded on the  evidence  before
      them that, upon release from prison/immigration detention,  Mr  Folkes
      would resume living as a family with [LW], [D], and [R]. In  fact,  as
      the FTT Judge found at [15], the Upper  Tribunal  was  "hoodwinked  in
      allowing the appeal on the basis of the interests of  the  Appellant's
      wife and children. What they were not told was that the marriage  was,
      in practice, in severe jeopardy by the time they heard  evidence  from
      the parties. It came to an end in actuality  and  physical  separation
      immediately afterwards".


  51. We heard that, after his release from immigration detention in October
      2010, Mr Folkes never returned to live at the family home.  In 2011 he
      began a new relationship with [DF].  Although he initially  maintained
      intermittent contact with  [LW],  even  to  the  extent  of  fathering
      another child by her in 2012, by the date of the FTT  hearing  he  and
      [LW] had fallen out, and she would no longer allow him  to  see  their
      children.  The FTT accepted his evidence that,  although  he  had  not
      seen the children for about 3ï¿½ months, he wished  to  restore  contact
      and could do  so  if  he  made  the  effort,  including  taking  court
      proceedings.   This was over-optimistic since,  by  the  date  of  the
      hearing before us, he had not repaired the rift  with  [LW],  had  not
      applied to a court for contact, and had  not  seen  the  children  for
      about 7ï¿½ months.  Thus, he no longer had any relationship  with  [LW],
      and his relationship with their children was fragile.


  52. In 2010, the Upper Tribunal placed weight upon the  position  of  [D],
      his step-daughter, who was then aged 17 and a child of the family  (at
      [40] and [43]).  She was aged 9 when Mr Folkes met [LW], he had been a
      part of her life since then, and had been a good step-father  to  her.
      If her mother had to move to Jamaica with Mr Folkes and [R], she would
      be placed in a difficult situation.  Her life was in the UK, where she
      enjoyed contact with her natural father.  But she was still  dependent
      upon her mother and she was part of the family unit.  By the  time  of
      the FTT hearing in 2017, [D] was a young adult, aged 24,  and  was  no
      longer a consideration in the article 8 assessment.


  53. In deciding that there would be a disproportionate  effect  on  [LW]'s
      article 8 rights, the Upper Tribunal took into account  that  she  was
      born and brought up in the UK and she remained close to her family and
      foster parents, whom she visited regularly.  She had only been once to
      Jamaica for a two week holiday when she found that Mr  Folkes'  mother
      lived in a shanty house.  She told the tribunal  that  she  could  not
      settle in Jamaica. She had supported the family whilst Mr  Folkes  was
      in prison and continued to work.


  54. In our view, the FTT erred in equating [DF]'s position  with  that  of
      [LW], as they were quite different.  Unlike [LW] who had no ties  with
      Jamaica, [DF] was a Jamaican national, who came from the same area  as
      Mr Folkes.  Whereas [LW] gave evidence that  she  would  not  move  to
      Jamaica, [DF] gave evidence to the FTT that if Mr Folkes was  deported
      to Jamaica, she and her children would go with him.  We consider  that
      this was a crucial distinction between [DF] and [LW].


  55. In our judgment, the FTT identified the correct legal test, but failed
      to apply it to the facts of this case.  We agree with  the  SSHD  that
      the FTT erred in treating the current circumstances as essentially the
      same as before.  At [18], the FTT Judge said "the facts in  the  first
      determination have been reconstituted all over again with a change  of
      personnel: [DP] as the current baby mother in a sequence of four:  one
      in Jamaica, [TB], [LW] and [DP]". However, the changes in  Mr  Folkes'
      private  and  family  life  were  significant,  and  the   article   8
      considerations needed to be re-assessed.  In view of these changes, it
      was inapt to characterise the SSHD's decision as "pulling the rug from
      under his feet", and to  treat  that  as  a  factor  weighing  against
      deportation. Moreover, Mr Folkes' position remained precarious, as  he
      was only given periods of 6 months  leave.  In  our  view,  the  FTT's
      erroneous approach infected the entire  decision-making  process,  and
      called into question whether the "very compelling circumstances"  test
      had been applied with sufficient rigour.


  56. In view of the FTT's failure to apply the correct legal  test  to  the
      evidence, we set the decision aside and re-make it.


    The article 8 assessment


  57. It was common ground that Mr Folkes was a  foreign  criminal  who  had
      been sentenced to a period of imprisonment in excess of 4  years,  and
      therefore he fell within  section  117C(6)  NIAA  2002  and  paragraph
      398(a) of the Immigration Rules.  The public interest in  deportation,
      for the legitimate aim under article 8 ECHR of preventing disorder  or
      crime, would only be outweighed by other factors if  there  were  very
      compelling circumstances  over  and  above  those  described  in  sub-
      sections 117C(4) or (5) NIAA 2002.  It was agreed that  Mr  Folkes'  4
      children and 2 step-children were qualifying children for the purposes
      of section 117D NIAA 2002 and [DF] was a qualifying partner.

  58. Mr Folkes relied upon the case of MN-T (Colombia) v Secretary of State
      for the Home  Department  [2013]  EWCA  Civ  893  in  support  of  the
      proposition that the strengthening of family and private life during a
      period of delay in effecting removal ought to be taken into account in
      the evaluative exercise under article 8.  In EB (Kosovo)  v  Secretary
      of State for the Home Department [2008] UKHL 41,  [2009]  1  AC  1159,
      Lord Bingham said, at [14] - [16], that delay in the  decision  making
      process could be relevant to an article 8 claim if,  for  example,  it
      has resulted in the applicant developing closer  personal  and  social
      ties and forming relationships in the expectation that he is not going
      to be removed. In both those cases it was alleged that  the  SSHD  had
      delayed either in implementing deportation or in  making  a  decision,
      neither of which applies here. However, we accept that, insofar as  Mr
      Folkes' private and family life has strengthened during  the  time  he
      has spent in the UK since 2010, this is a factor which should be taken
      into account.

    (1) Criminality and rehabilitation


  59. Rape is a very serious crime and there is a strong public interest  in
      deporting a person convicted of such a  serious  offence.   Mr  Folkes
      pleaded not guilty but he was convicted after a trial. The  sentencing
      judge increased the minimum 5 year sentence  due  to  the  aggravating
      factors, namely, that it occurred in the victim's home late at  night;
      her young son was in the room next door; after she thought he had left
      the flat, he returned  and  continued  to  frighten  her.   The  Upper
      Tribunal recorded that he was not  assessed  as  "dangerous"  for  the
      purpose of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, and concluded  that  he  did
      not present a danger to the public.   He  did  not  complete  the  Sex
      Offenders Treatment Programme in prison because he denied  his  guilt,
      but, according to the Upper Tribunal, he undertook to complete  it  in
      the community as a condition of his licence.  The Upper Tribunal found
      that Mr Folkes  had  addressed  his  behaviour  and  acknowledged  the
      seriousness of his offence.


  60. In assessing his criminality, and the risk of re-offending, it  is  an
      important point in his favour that he has not been  convicted  of  any
      other offences, before or since the offence of rape.  Ten  years  have
      now elapsed since he was convicted, and he has been in  the  community
      for 7 years, without incident.


  61. Mr Folkes submitted witness statements from a range of individuals who
      praised his integrity, hard work, community activities and  commitment
      to friends and family.

    (2) Mr Folkes'partner, [DF]


  62. Mr Folkes has been in a relationship with [DF] since  2011,  and  they
      are now living together. [DF] is a Jamaican national  with  indefinite
      leave to remain in the UK.  Mr Folkes and [DF]  knew  one  another  in
      Jamaica, as they both came from the same area. [DF]  was  working  for
      Freezone where Mr Folkes' brother was the manager, and where Mr Folkes
      also worked for a time.  [DF] gave evidence to  the  FTT  that  if  Mr
      Folkes was deported to Jamaica, she and her  children  would  go  with
      him.  The FTT discounted this evidence as "unrealistic" at  [29],  for
      reasons  relating  to  her  children,  which  we  address  below  when
      considering the children's best interests.  As far as  [DF]  alone  is
      concerned, we consider that she could reasonably  return  to  live  in
      Jamaica with Mr Folkes, if she wished to do so.  If she chose  not  to
      do so, she could visit him there and keep in contact via modern  means
      of communication.








    (3) Best interests of the children


  63. We have set out above the principles to be applied when assessing  the
      best interests of children.  The Upper Tribunal  in  Azimi-Moayed  and
      Others [2013] UKUT 00197 helpfully  summarised  the  principles  which
      have emerged from the case law of the  Upper  Tribunal  to  assist  in
      determining appeals where children are affected:


           "(1) As a starting point it is in the best interests of children
           to be with both their parents and  if  both  parents  are  being
           removed from the United Kingdom then the starting point suggests
           that so  should  dependant  children  who  form  part  of  their
           household unless there are reasons to the contrary.


           (2) It is generally in the interests of children  to  have  both
           stability and continuity of social and educational provision and
           the benefit of growing up in the cultural norms of  the  society
           to which they belong.


           (3) Lengthy residence in a  country  other  than  the  state  of
           origin  can  lead  to  development  of  social,   cultural   and
           educational ties that it would be inappropriate to  disrupt,  in
           the absence of compelling reason to the contrary.  What  amounts
           to lengthy residence is not  clear  cut  but  past  and  present
           policies have identified seven years as a relevant period.


           (4) Apart from the terms of published policies  and  rules,  the
           Tribunal notes that seven years from age four is  likely  to  be
           more significant to a child than the first seven years of  life.
           Very young children are focussed on their  parents  rather  than
           their peers and are adaptable.


           ..."


  64. The witness statements submitted by Mr Folkes praised him  as  a  good
      father to his children. The FTT said that he had been described  as  a
      model father (at [20]).


  65. [T] is now aged 14.  He is a British citizen and lives with his mother
      [TB]. Mr Folkes abandoned [TB] when  she  was  pregnant,  but  he  has
      maintained contact with his son. The Upper Tribunal found in 2010 that
      Mr Folkes saw [T] weekly, and that he visited Mr Folkes and  his  wife
      [LW] in their home, until Mr Folkes went to prison.  Mr Folkes kept in
      touch with him from prison by telephone and by sending him cards.  The
      Upper Tribunal concluded  that  deportation  was  not  in  [T]'s  best
      interests, because contact would  be  limited  to  correspondence  and
      occasional visits.


  66. The FTT Judge recorded  that  Mr  Folkes  said  little  about  [T]  in
      evidence, other than that he still maintained contact  with  him.  The
      FTT concluded that Mr Folkes "clearly remains a figure of some  degree
      of significance to [T]" (at [29]) and that if Mr Folkes was  deported,
      the contact would cease save for correspondence.  He  considered  that
      Skype would involve too much maternal cooperation to be realistic.


  67. In our judgment, it is in [T]'s best interests for Mr Folkes to remain
      in the UK so that [T] can have regular direct contact  with  him.   We
      accept that, as the SSHD said in her decision  letter,  [T]  would  be
      able to maintain a limited  relationship  with  [T]  from  abroad  via
      modern means of communication, such  as  telephone,  email,  Facebook,
      FaceTime, Skype etc. and that [T]  would  be  able  to  visit  him  in
      Jamaica.  We  do  not  consider  that  [T]  would  need  his  mother's
      assistance  to  use  Skype  at  age  14.   However,  a  long  distance
      relationship would be second-best for [T].


  68. [R] is now aged 12.  He is a British citizen and lives with his mother
      [LW].  The Upper Tribunal recorded in 2010  that  he  had  behavioural
      difficulties and was seen in the Active Child Clinic, but rejected the
      suggestion  that  his  condition  was  triggered  or  exacerbated   by
      separation from his  father.  The  Upper  Tribunal  accepted  that  Mr
      Folkes' wife [LW] had difficulty in providing for the family  as  well
      as caring for [R] whilst Mr Folkes was in prison.   It  also  accepted
      that she did not wish to  uproot  her  life  in  England  to  move  to
      Jamaica, though it did not rule out the possibility  that  the  family
      would move to Jamaica with Mr Folkes.  The Upper Tribunal made several
      reference to [LW] standing by Mr Folkes and forgiving him, and plainly
      envisaged that they  would  resume  family  life  if  his  appeal  was
      allowed.  It was on this basis that the Upper Tribunal concluded  that
      deportation would be disproportionate because of the article 8  rights
      of [R] and the other members of the family.   We  now  know  that  the
      marriage was already in jeopardy and that it ended shortly  after  the
      Upper Tribunal's determination.


  69. Mr Folkes has not lived with [R] for some ten years, since he was sent
      to prison in 2007.  [R] visited Mr Folkes in prison and Mr Folkes  had
      fortnightly contact with him after his release from detention in 2010.
       There was evidence that  he  took  [R]  to  school  and  to  football
      training. However, he has not seen [R] at all for the last 7ï¿½  months,
      because of the breakdown in the relationship with his mother [LW].  He
      believes that contact will not resume unless ordered by a  court,  but
      he has not applied for a court order as yet.  The FTT found that their
      relationship would be limited  to  correspondence  if  Mr  Folkes  was
      deported, as [LW] would not cooperate in setting up Skype  calls.  The
      FTT concluded that Mr Folkes "clearly remains a figure of some  degree
      of significance" to [R] (at [29]) and it would be contrary to his best
      interests for  Mr  Folkes  to  be  deported  because  of  the  limited
      opportunities for contact. We agree that it is in [R]'s best interests
      for Mr Folkes to remain in the UK so that [R] can have regular  direct
      contact with him.  We accept  that  they  will  be  able  to  maintain
      limited contact through modern means of communication, but this  would
      be inferior to face-to-face contact between father  and  child.   That
      said, there is a  real  risk  that  Mr  Folkes  will  not  resume  any
      meaningful contact with [R], even if he does remain in the UK.


  70. [R] is now aged 4. She is a British citizen who lives with her  mother
      [LW].  The relationship between her parents had ended before her birth
      and so she has never spent much time with Mr Folkes.  As with [R],  Mr
      Folkes had fortnightly contact with her until  the  breakdown  in  his
      relationship with [LW], but he has had no contact  with  her  for  the
      last 7ï¿½ months. He  believes  that  contact  will  not  resume  unless
      ordered by a court, but he has not applied for a court order  as  yet.
      The FTT found that Mr Folkes "clearly remains a figure of some  degree
      of significance" to [R] (at [29]) and it would be contrary to her best
      interests for Mr Folkes to be deported because  of  the  reduction  in
      contact. We agree with  the  FTT  that  it  would  be  in  [R]'s  best
      interests to have face-to-face contact with Mr Folkes, particularly as
      she is so young, though even if he remains in the UK, there is a  real
      risk that contact will not resume.


  71. [L] is now aged 5.  He is a British citizen who lives with his  mother
      [DF] and Mr Folkes.  The FTT found that Mr Folkes played a big part in
      [L]'s life (at [29]). Plainly, it is in [L]'s best interest for him to
      live in a family unit with both parents, if possible.   If  Mr  Folkes
      was deported, and [L] remained in the UK, they would only have limited
      contact, which would not be in his best interests. Presumably this was
      one of the reasons why [DF] gave evidence that she wished to  relocate
      to Jamaica with her children if Mr Folkes was deported.


  72. The FTT found that it would not be in [L]'s best interests to live  in
      Jamaica with his parents as he would  be  raised  in  a  "crime-ridden
      ghetto".  Both Mr Folkes and [DF] gave evidence to the  FTT  that  the
      area from which they originated was impoverished and had a high  crime
      rate.  Whilst we recognise that the quality of life in Jamaica may  in
      some respects be inferior to the UK, we cannot agree  with  the  FTT's
      assessment that it is in  the  best  interests  of  a  child  born  to
      Jamaican parents not to live in Jamaica because of  the  economic  and
      social conditions there. As Mr Folkes and [DF] would be  returning  to
      their home  neighbourhood,  they  would  know  how  to  protect  their
      children from the dangers there.  They would also have the  option  of
      relocating within Jamaica.


  73. [DF] has two children by her ex-husband, who are now aged  9  and  13.
      Mr Folkes has a good relationship with his step-children, described by
      the FTT as "useful".  The FTT Judge said he accepted  [DF]'s  evidence
      that she valued her relationship  with  Mr  Folkes  and  his  paternal
      relationship with all three children (at [21]).  In  evidence  to  the
      FTT, [DF] expressed a low opinion of her ex-husband and said  he  sees
      their children "when he feels like it".  At the hearing before us,  we
      were told there was no regular contact  between  [DF]'s  children  and
      their father.  Whilst we recognise  the  importance  of  the  children
      maintaining contact with their father, they would be able to  keep  in
      touch via Skype, FaceTime etc, and on visits to the UK.   No  evidence
      was adduced to suggest that a move to Jamaica would be an unacceptable
      interference with their private lives (culture, school, friends  etc.)
      in the UK. In our view, the question as  to  what  is  in  their  best
      interests is finely balanced as their relationship with  their  father
      appears to be minimal. Their mother  is  likely  to  be  in  the  best
      position to decide whether they  should  re-locate  to  Jamaica  as  a
      family with their mother and Mr Folkes, or  remain  in  the  UK  in  a
      single parent family with their mother.

    (4) Immigration history, private and family life


  74. Mr Folkes arrived in the UK as a young adult aged 26 and has been here
      for 16 years, which is a  lengthy  period.   We  accept  that  he  has
      developed a strong private life in the UK, with friends and  community
      ties, as well as employment.   However, he was brought up  in  Jamaica
      and worked there before he came to the UK.  Despite his concerns about
      finding work and accommodation, we consider that he will be able to re-
      integrate into life in Jamaica.  He has relatives there and his skills
      as a builder ought to assist him in finding work.


  75. Mr Folkes developed his private and family life in the UK when he knew
      that he was here unlawfully or that his stay was precarious.  That  is
      a factor which reduces the weight to be accorded to  his  private  and
      family life. In Jeunesse v Netherlands (2015) 60 EHRR  17,  the  ECtHR
      said, at [108]:

           "Another important consideration  is  whether  family  life  was
           created at a time when the persons involved were aware that  the
           immigration status of one of them was such that the  persistence
           of that family life within the host state would from the  outset
           be precarious. It is the Court's well-established case law that,
           where this is the case, it is likely only to be  in  exceptional
           circumstances that the removal of the non-national family member
           will constitute a violation of art. 8."


    This consideration is (in part) reflected in subsections (4) and (5) of
    section 117B NIAA 2002.

  76. Mr Folkes remained in the UK without leave  from  the  expiry  of  his
      visit visa in mid-2002  until  he  was  granted  leave  to  remain  in
      November 2005.  During that period when he was in the  UK  unlawfully,
      he entered into a relationship with Tricia and fathered his  son  [T];
      and he  married  [LW]  and  fathered  his  son  [R].   Thereafter  his
      immigration status remained precarious  throughout.   He  was  refused
      leave to remain as a spouse, and only  given  discretionary  leave  to
      remain for 3 years in November 2005.  After his successful deportation
      appeal, he was only given consecutive periods of  leave  of  6  months
      duration, and should have been aware that a  change  in  circumstances
      could result in a re-consideration of his  article  8  claim.   During
      this time, he entered in a relationship with [DF] and her two children
      and fathered his son [L].  He also had a further child with [LW].


  77. When he applied for a renewed grant of leave on 9 May 2014, he  misled
      the SSHD by failing to disclose that he was no longer living with  his
      wife [LW] and their children, and had a new partner, [DF], and a child
      [L]. He gave the family home as his address though he  was  no  longer
      living there.  The SSHD did not discover the true  position  until  Mr
      Folkes appealed to the FTT.


    Conclusions


78. We are not satisfied that there are very compelling reasons,  over  and
    above those described in Exceptions 1  and  2  in  section  117C  which
    outweigh the public interest in deportation in this  case.   Mr  Folkes
    does not meet the requirements of Exception 1 or 2.  He does  not  meet
    the  requirements  of  Exception  1  because  he  will  not  face  very
    significant obstacles to integrating into Jamaica, for the  reasons  we
    have explained.  As to Exception 2, we accept that it  is  not  in  the
    best interests of Mr Folkes' children for him to be  deported,  because
    face-to-face contact is more meaningful than long-distance contact.  It
    is a realistic option for his partner [DF] to re-locate to Jamaica with
    her children.  However, that would deprive [DF]'s two older children of
    face-to-face contact with their natural father. If [L] remains  in  the
    UK, the separation from his father and the lost opportunity to grow  up
    in a home with both parents present would not be in his best interests.
     For  these  reasons,  we  conclude  that  the  effect  of  Mr  Folkes'
    deportation would be very harsh  upon  some  or  all  of  the  children
    referred to above; had the offence of which he was convicted been  less
    serious such that he had been imprisoned for below 4  years,  we  might
    just have been persuaded that the effect on  his  children  was  unduly
    harsh, such that the requirements of Exception 2 were met, because  the
    public interest in his deportation would in  those  circumstances  have
    been  marginally  lower.  We  acknowledge  that  deportation  will   be
    upsetting for [DF] if she decides to remain in the UK, but  we  do  not
    consider that it would be harsh in all the circumstances.


  79. However, the best interests of children  do  not  override  all  other
      factors, for the purposes of section 117D(6) and article 8.  Mr Folkes
      has been in the UK for many years, during which time he has  developed
      a strong private life, and rehabilitated himself since his  conviction
      over ten years ago.  Nonetheless, we are satisfied  that  he  will  be
      able to re-integrate into life in Jamaica. We bear  in  mind  that  Mr
      Folkes has a chequered immigration history.  Parliament  has  declared
      that the deportation of a foreign criminal is conducive to the  public
      good and the public interest requires deportation for those  sentenced
      to a term of  imprisonment  of  4  years  or  more.  Having  carefully
      considered all relevant factors, and weighed them in the  balance,  we
      have  been  unable  to  find  very  compelling  circumstances  against
      deportation, over and above those  in  Exception  2,  as  required  by
      section 117C(6). Mr Folkes was convicted of a very serious  crime  and
      given a lengthy prison sentence.  In our judgment,  deportation  is  a
      proportionate response,  and  the  interference  with  his  article  8
      rights, and the article 8 rights  of  his  partner  and  children,  is
      justified in this case.


DECISION

    The First-tier Tribunal Judge made an error on a point of law and we re-
    make the decision in the following terms:


    The appeal by the  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department  is
    allowed.  Mr  Folkes'  appeal  on  human  rights  grounds  against  the
    Secretary of State for the Home Department's decision to deport him  is
    dismissed.
