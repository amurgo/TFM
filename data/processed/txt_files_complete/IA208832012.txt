                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                                  O M OLOBA

                                                                  Respondent


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    1. This is an appeal against a  determination  by  FtT  Judge  Balloch,
       promulgated  on  11/1/13.   It  comes  before  me  pursuant  to  the
       following directions, issued on 4/3/13:


           Parties  may  wish  to  submit  on  how  recent  authority,   in
           particular  Khatel  and  others  (s85A;  effect  of   continuing
           application) [2013] UKUT 00044 (IAC), bears on this case.

           It is noted that the SSHD's decision of 14 September 2012 states
           that the date of award of the appellant's eligible qualification
           was 30 May 2012.

           Parties have a further 14 days from the date of issue  of  these
           directions to serve on the UT and  on  each  other  any  further
           written submissions  concerning  the  disposal  of  the  appeal.
           Failing a response from the SSHD within the time limited by this
           direction, the Tribunal is likely to assume that the  appeal  is
           no longer insisted upon, and to issue a determination without  a
           hearing, dismissing the SSHD's appeal to the UT,  and  directing
           that the determination of the FtT shall stand.

    2. No response from the SSHD is on file.


    3. The SSHD's appeal to the UT is dismissed.  The determination of  the
       FtT shall stand.

    4. No order for anonymity has been requested or made.
