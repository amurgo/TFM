                                                                   Appellant

                          mr FRANCIS CHINEDU ONYELA
                        (NO ANONYMITY DIRECTION made)
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr McVeetie, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Unrepresented


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. I do not make an anonymity direction in this matter.

 2. The respondent in these proceedings was the appellant before the First-
    tier Tribunal.  From hereon I have referred to the parties as they were
    in the First-tier Tribunal so  that,  for  example,  reference  to  the
    respondent is a reference to  the  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department.

 3. The appellant is a  citizen  of  Nigeria  and  on  April  15,  2015  he
    requested a reconsideration of a decision, taken by the  respondent  to
    refuse his application for leave to remain on human rights grounds. The
    respondent considered the application but refused it on April 20, 2016.



 4. The appellant appealed that decision on May 6, 2017 and the appeal came
    before Judge of the First-tier Tribunal M Davies on February 28,  2017.
    In a decision promulgated on March 7, 2017  Judge  Davies  allowed  the
    appeal to the  extent  that  he  remitted  the  decision  back  to  the
    respondent for not being in accordance with the law.

 5. The respondent appealed that decision on March 14, 2017  on  the  basis
    that Paragraph 37 of Schedule 9 to the Immigration  Act  2014  repealed
    sections 87 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002.  That
    section had previously enabled a Judge to remit a decision back to  the
    respondent for not being in accordance with the law. Judge of the First-
    tier Tribunal Bird found an arguable error in law on September 8,  2017
    and the matter was listed before me today.

 6. The appellant accepted the Judge had erred for the reasons given by the
    respondent in her grounds of appeal as set out above. I concurred  with
    the grounds of appeal.

 7. I told the appellant I would remit the case back to Judge of the First-
    tier Tribunal M Davies for a further hearing in the First-tier Tribunal
    in light of Part 3 Section 7.1 to 7.3 of  the  Practice  Statement  and
    that the appellant should provide statements from both himself and  the
    mother of their child along with  any  other  evidence  he  felt  would
    assist his case.

 8. Unusually I direct that the case be re-listed before Judge Davies so he
    can deal with the article 8 issues that remain outstanding.

    NOTICE OF DECISION

 9. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.  I remit the human rights  appeal
    back to the First-tier Tribunal for a fresh hearing on this issue.
