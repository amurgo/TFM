     DECISION PURSUANT TO RULE 40(3)(a) OF THE TRIBUNAL PROCEDURE (UPPER
                            TRIBUNAL) RULES 2008

 1.  The  appellants  are  citizens  of  Nepal,  born  in  1977  and  1979,
    respectively. They appealed to the First-tier Tribunal ("FtT")  against
    decisions dated 5 November 2018 and 10 August  2018,  respectively,  to
    refuse entry clearance as  the  dependent  children  of  an  ex  Gurkha
    soldier.  The FtT dismissed the appeal of each appellant.

 2. At the hearing before me on 19 December 2019 it was agreed between  the
    parties that the FtT erred in law in relation to each appellant for the
    reasons advanced in the grounds of  appeal  upon  which  permission  to
    appeal was granted, as further explained in the skeleton argument dated
    18 December 2019, and in particular in relation to:

    (i)  the conclusion that there was no documentary evidence of the first
         appellant's divorce ; and

    (ii)     the finding that the first appellant's account  of  events  is
         inconsistent with "cultural norms"; and

    (iii)    the application of the correct test for family life in  Gurkha
         cases; and

    (iv)     a failure to consider relevant evidence, for example  evidence
         of financial support from the sponsor.

 3. It was also agreed between the  parties  that  the  errors  of  law  in
    relation to each appellant are such as to require  the  decision(s)  of
    the FtT to be set aside and for the appeals to be remitted to  the  FtT
    for a hearing de novo.

 4. In the circumstances, I set aside the decision of the FtT for error  of
    law and remit the appeals to the FtT for a hearing de novo, in  respect
    of each appellant, before a judge other than First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    Khawar, with no findings of fact preserved.

 5. In remitting the appeals I have had regard  to  paragraph  7.2  of  the
    Practice Statement of the Senior President of Tribunals.

 6. Pursuant to rule 40(3)(a) of the Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)
    Rules 2008, no reasons (or further reasons) are required, the  decision
    being made with the consent of the parties.


Upper Tribunal Judge Kopieczek                            dated 19/12/19
