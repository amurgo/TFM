Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Afghanistan born on 1st January 1994.

 2. The Appellant arrived in the United Kingdom on or about 29th May  2008.
    He claimed asylum approximately a month later on 25th June  2008.   His
    application for asylum was refused but  he  was  granted  discretionary
    leave  to  remain  until  1st  August  2012,  in  accordance  with  the
    Respondent's policy relating  to  unaccompanied  minors.   He  appealed
    against the refusal but his appeal was dismissed on 26th November  2008
    by Immigration Judge  Pooler.   Thereafter  his  appeal  rights  became
    exhausted.

 3. On 29th June 2012 the Appellant applied for further  leave  to  remain.
    His application was refused by the Respondent  on  6th  June  2014  and
    directions were given for his removal  from  the  United  Kingdom.   An
    appeal against that decision was dismissed by Judge of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Matthews in a determination dated 16th  September  2014.   The
    appeal hearing in the First-tier Tribunal took place on  2nd  September
    2014.

 4. The Appellant's representatives applied for permission  to  appeal  and
    permission was granted in the First-tier Tribunal on 9th October  2014.
    The judge who granted permission  considered  it  arguable  that  Judge
    Matthews erred in law in that he failed to give proper  weight  to  the
    expert report of Dr Giustozzi and that he failed to give proper  weight
    to the evidence of Jane  Oakley,  whose  letter  was  also  before  the
    Tribunal at the appeal hearing.

 5. The Respondent's representative filed a Rule  24  response  dated  20th
    October 2014.  The response contends that the First-tier Judge directed
    himself appropriately and that the Appellant's Grounds of Appeal are no
    more than  a  lengthy  expression  of  disagreement  with  the  judge's
    findings.

 6. Thus the matter came before me in the Upper Tribunal for  an  error  of
    law hearing on 5th  January  2015.   Representation  was  as  mentioned
    above.  I had before me all the documents which were before the  First-
    tier Tribunal.  In addition, I have taken into account the  Appellant's
    consolidated bundle submitted by his solicitors on 26th November  2014,
    a bundle of case law and a skeleton argument prepared by  Mr  Draycott.
    At the end of the hearing I reserved my decision which I now give.

 7. The Appellant's initial asylum claim was refused on 30th September 2008
    and his appeal against that refusal was dismissed by Immigration  Judge
    Pooler in a determination dated 25th November 2008.  Judge Matthews has
    referred to this determination and, at paragraph 15 of his decision and
    reasons, has referred to the principles set out  in  Devaseelan  [2002]
    UKIAT 00702.  Judge Matthews points out that in his latest  appeal  the
    Appellant is not advancing a significantly different factual account of
    his experiences in Afghanistan to that put before Judge Pooler.   Judge
    Matthews has correctly taken into account Judge  Pooler's  findings  as
    his starting point.

 8. The circumstances of the Appellant's initial claim are set out by Judge
    Pooler in his decision from paragraph 7 onwards.  His claim  was  based
    on his father's claimed activities as a commander  with  Hizb-i-Islami.
    The Appellant was told by his mother that his father  was  a  commander
    and for as long as the Appellant could remember  his  father  had  been
    away from home for two or three months at a time, returning for periods
    of between ten and fifteen days.  The Appellant's  father  was  brought
    home in 2007 having been wounded by the authorities.  Subsequently  the
    Appellant's house was attacked.  In interview he said that  there  were
    three attacks, the first of which occurred one month after  his  father
    had recovered from his injuries and  rejoined  Hizb-i-Islami.   At  the
    time of the first attack the  Appellant  was  in  the  house  with  his
    mother, grandmother and siblings.  A second attack took  place  ten  or
    fifteen days later when the Appellant, his mother, his grandmother  and
    his brother were present.  Two  months  later  the  Appellant's  father
    returned  home.   The  house  was  subject  to  an  attack  at   night.
    Subsequently the Appellant saw the dead bodies of his  father's  friend
    and two other men.  His father was missing.

 9. The Appellant and other members of his family fled to the house of  his
    maternal uncle.  After the attack a message  was  sent  to  the  family
    saying that they would be killed.  The Appellant was told by his  uncle
    that  he  would  be  next  as  he  was  the  eldest  male.   Therefore,
    arrangements were made for the  Appellant  to  be  taken  to  Iran  and
    eventually to the United Kingdom.

10.  As  Mr  Draycott  has  pointed  out  in  his  skeleton  argument   and
    submissions, Judge Pooler made a  number  of  findings  which  were  in
    favourable to the Appellant.  He accepted the  Appellant's  account  of
    his father's involvement with  Hizb-i-Islami.   He  accepted  that  the
    Appellant's father was a commander although he noted that there was  no
    evidence to suggest that the father was anything  other  than  a  local
    commander.  There was no  evidence  to  suggest  that  the  Appellant's
    father was known outside his local area.  Judge  Pooler  also  accepted
    that the Appellant's father was wounded in combat by the authorities.

11. It is pertinent to note that Judge Pooler had the benefit of  a  report
    by Dr Giustozzi.  Judge Pooler rightly paid  careful  attention  to  Dr
    Giustozzi's report but concluded, at paragraph  23,  that  it  did  not
    establish that the Appellant would be at risk on return.  Judge  Pooler
    said this:

         "While I accept Dr Giustozzi's  expert  evidence  that  clashes  in
         Kunar have been very frequent, the appellant  must,  if  he  is  to
         succeed in this appeal, satisfy me that he as an  individual  would
         be at real risk for a Convention reason.  I am not  satisfied  that
         the appellant, at the age of 14 and having no history  of  personal
         involvement with Hizb-i-Islami, would be individually  targeted  by
         reason of an imputed political opinion.  Dr Giustozzi describes the
         appellant as 'a likely target for arrest and interrogation' but  he
         has not satisfied me that the appellant as an individual  would  be
         at real risk in spite of the evidence in his report that as many as
         15,000 people have been detained by the authorities for questioning
         in Afghanistan".

12. Judge Pooler further concluded, having taken into account  the  Country
    of Origin Report on Afghanistan  that  he  was  not  satisfied  on  the
    evidence that the Appellant would  effectively  be  left  to  fend  for
    himself as a street child in Kabul.  Further, there was no evidence  to
    suggest that the Appellant's uncle would be unable to make arrangements
    for the Appellant to be brought from Kabul to his home area.  The uncle
    had after all been able to arrange for  the  Appellant's  journey  from
    Afghanistan to the United Kingdom.  Judge Pooler was not  satisfied  on
    the evidence that contact with the Appellant's family could not be made
    and that arrangements for his accompanied travel from  Kabul  to  Kunar
    could not be put in place.

13. Judge Pooler's determination has not been  successfully  challenged  on
    appeal.  His findings are  valid  and  subsisting  and  Judge  Matthews
    rightly adopted  them  as  his  starting  point  when  considering  the
    Appellant's most  recent  appeal.   However,  at  paragraph  15,  Judge
    Matthews has rightly confirmed that it is his duty to consider all  the
    evidence before him as to risk to the Appellant, and  his  evidence  on
    the issue of attempts to contact his family, and make his own  findings
    and conclusions since they are inevitably matters that are  capable  of
    changing  over  the  period  that  has  elapsed  since  Judge  Pooler's
    decision.

14. The main thrust of Mr Draycott's argument is that Judge Matthews failed
    to give sufficient weight to the evidence of Dr Giustozzi, a well-known
    expert on Afghanistan, whose evidence has been accepted by  courts  and
    Tribunals on many occasions.  Mr Draycott acknowledged that a judge  is
    not obliged to accept the opinion of a well-known  expert  but,  if  he
    declines to accept it, then cogent reasons for  so  doing  need  to  be
    given.

15. As I have already pointed out, Dr Giustozzi's  evidence  in  the  first
    appeal did not satisfy Judge Pooler that the Appellant's  claim  should
    succeed, even on the low  standard  of  proof.   That  finding  remains
    undisturbed.

16. It is clear from  Judge  Matthews'  decision  that  he  has  given  due
    consideration to Dr Giustozzi's  further  report.   This  is  mentioned
    first at paragraph 14 and then at paragraph 16 the judge states -

         "I note the further export report and  have  considered  that  with
         care, I shall address it contents in relation to my own findings as
         to the present risk on return.  I do not accept, as stated  in  the
         further  report,  that  there  has  been  any  misunderstanding  in
         Immigration Judge Pooler's mind as to the assertions of the  expert
         in the report prepared for the first appeal".

17. There is further reference at paragraph 19 where Judge Matthews  states
    -

        "On the evidence it could not be established  who  was  responsible
        for the attacks (on the Appellant's home).   I  have  reviewed  the
        further expert report before me and note that at  page  21  onwards
        views are  expressed  as  to  the  attacks  being  typical  of  the
        Arabakai, but the authorities cannot be ruled out as  perpetrators.
        I still find, on a fresh analysis of this  area  of  the  evidence,
        that the perpetrators of the attacks cannot be established".

18. Moving on to paragraph 27 of the decision, at that point Judge Matthews
    explains why he has declined to accept Dr Giustozzi's  latest  opinion.
    He states -

         "I diverge from the expert opinion before  me  because  the  expert
         finds that the Appellant is at risk due to his father's activities,
         but in my judgment the evidence does not indicate that his father's
         activities were the cause of attacks on the family home,  nor  does
         it show any interest in the Appellant individually  or  his  family
         beyond the inevitable risks  that  are  inherent  in  residence  in
         modern Afghanistan".

19. It is trite law to say that a First-tier Judge does not have to  accept
    the opinion of an expert witness, no matter  how  well  respected  that
    expert may be.  However, Mr Draycott is also correct to point out  that
    if the expert's opinion is to be rejected, then adequate  reasons  have
    to be given.  The weight to be given  to  the  evidence  of  an  expert
    witness is essentially a matter for the Tribunal Judge.  I am satisfied
    that in this case  Judge  Matthews  has  given  a  clear  and  adequate
    explanation in support of his decision to diverge from  Dr  Giustozzi's
    opinion.

20. Permission to appeal was also given on the basis  that  Judge  Matthews
    arguably failed to give proper weight to the evidence  of  Jane  Oakley
    and that his conclusion that the Appellant would have  the  support  of
    his mother and younger siblings failed to reflect the  evidence.   This
    is a matter which was also relied upon by Mr Draycott in submissions.

21. Mr Draycott is correct in pointing out that nowhere in his decision and
    reasons does Judge Matthews make any direct reference to a letter dated
    2nd July 2014 from Jane Oakley, which is at page 44 in the  Appellant's
    bundle.  Ms Oakley is employed by an organisation  called  Futures  and
    expresses the opinion that the Appellant suffers  either  from  a  mild
    learning disability or autism.  I have to consider whether the  failure
    to make findings in respect of this letter amounts to a material  error
    of law.

22. The first point to note, as I observed  during  the  hearing,  is  that
    there is nothing in the letter to suggest that Ms Oakley  is  qualified
    to diagnose or give an opinion  on  learning  difficulties  or  autism.
    Furthermore, it appears from her letter that there has never  been  any
    formal diagnosis to that effect.  Ms Oakley refers to the fact that the
    Appellant has never been formally assessed but that it is  her  opinion
    that he may have "mild learning difficulties  or  beyond  the  autistic
    spectrum".

23. In this context Judge Matthews has made explicit reference at paragraph
    21 to evidence from Mrs B Bassett, the Appellant's after-care  personal
    adviser.  Mrs Bassett is described as an experienced youth  worker  and
    personal adviser.  Judge Matthews noted her evidence to the effect that
    the Appellant had required support in  setting  up  his  own  flat  and
    arranging utility services.  Mrs Bassett explained in her evidence that
    when the Appellant lost his  first  employment  he  was  slow  to  seek
    jobseekers allowance despite her support and advice and that he  needed
    to do so urgently in order to  secure  housing  benefit.   Mrs  Bassett
    described the Appellant's behaviour  as  displaying  naivety  and  some
    unrealistic optimism at times.

24. Judge Matthews  accepted  (paragraph  22)  that  the  Appellant  needed
    support and was at times na�ve, and he was willing to  find  that  this
    went  beyond  a  simple  language   barrier   and   betrayed   cultural
    differences.  But he also found that the Appellant had been  successful
    in independently establishing himself and had  done  so  in  a  culture
    other than his own native culture.  The judge noted that the  Appellant
    needed more support than some care leavers but he  found  that  was  in
    part due to language and cultural differences.  He did  not  find  from
    the evidence that the Appellant has been unable to move to  independent
    living or that he lacked drive and motivation.  The  judge  also  found
    that the cultural matters that have contributed to  the  support  level
    required would not be relevant in Afghanistan.

25. The judge concluded that the Appellant  was  neither  an  unaccompanied
    child nor an orphan.  He has  never  been  approached  for  any  forced
    recruitment and he is now an adult.  The judge did not find a basis for
    any risk of persecution for a Convention reason that requires  a  grant
    of asylum.  In his decision on human rights, the judge found  that  the
    Appellant was born and lived in  Afghanistan  for  the  first  fourteen
    years of his life.  The judge found that his family remained there.  He
    speaks the local language.   The  judge  was  not  persuaded  that  the
    Appellant's six years in the UK have resulted in him no  longer  having
    real ties to  Afghanistan,  in  the  form  not  only  of  his  cultural
    background but also close family ties.

26. Article 8 has been assessed in accordance with  the  five  step  Razgar
    guidance at paragraph 44 onwards.  It is not argued on the  Appellant's
    behalf that he could satisfy the requirements of the Immigration  Rules
    so far as private life in this country is concerned.

27. As is noted in the grant of permission to appeal, the grounds submitted
    by Mr Draycott extend to ten pages which is  a  page  longer  than  the
    determination which they seek to challenge.  The Respondent's  Rule  24
    response argues that the grounds are nothing more than a  very  lengthy
    disagreement with the findings of the First-tier Judge.

28. In my view the First-tier Judge  has  made  clear  findings  which  are
    supported by cogent reasons.   The  determination  discloses  that  the
    judge has considered the appeal in the round as he is required  to  do.
    Having given careful consideration to the arguments, I am not persuaded
    that the First-tier Tribunal's decision discloses a material  error  of
    law such that it falls to be set aside.  I uphold the determination and
    dismiss the appeal.

No anonymity direction is made.
