Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms A Fijiwala, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms A Heller, Counsel


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. The respondent to this appeal is a citizen  of  Jamaica  born  on  12
       April 1969. The appellant is the Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
       Department, who has appealed with the permission  of  the  First-tier
       Tribunal against a decision  of  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
       Griffith, allowing the respondent's appeal against a decision of  the
       Secretary of State, dated 15 July 2014, to  remove  her  to  Jamaica,
       having refused her application for leave to remain  on  human  rights
       grounds. The Secretary of State refused the application for leave  on
       human rights grounds, having found Ms Isaacs could not succeed  under
       Appendix FM or paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration Rules, HC395,  and
       there were no exceptional circumstances for the purposes of Article 8
       of the Human Rights Convention.

    2. It is more convenient to refer to the parties as they were before the
       First-tier Tribunal. I shall therefore refer to Ms Isaacs from now on
       as "the appellant" and the Secretary of State as "the respondent".

    3. After an error of law hearing on  5  June  2015  I  set  aside  Judge
       Griffiths's decision and directed that the appeal should be  re-heard
       de novo in the Upper Tribunal. A copy of my decision to set aside the
       decision of the First-tier Tribunal is appended to this decision.

    4. I was not asked and saw no reason to make an anonymity direction.

    5. The appellant arrived in the UK as a visitor on 6 October 2000,  aged
       31. Having overstayed her leave to enter she claimed asylum, although
       this was later denied by the appellant, who said the application  had
       been made without her knowledge. The appellant was  notified  of  her
       liability to removal  on  22  May  2007.  She  made  a  human  rights
       application on 25 March 2013 but this was refused  on  22  June  2013
       without a right of appeal. Fresh representations were made on 20 July
       2013,  which  led  to  the  decision  now  appealed.  In  her   fresh
       representations, the appellant relied on her 12-year residence in the
       UK and her long-term relationship with Mr Franklyn Grant,  a  British
       citizen.

    6. At the beginning of the hearing Mrs Heller explained  she  would  not
       argue the appellant could meet the Immigration Rules either in  terms
       of family or private life. The case was pursued outside the rules.

    7. The appellant and Mr Grant attended the hearing to give evidence. The
       evidence and submissions have been recorded in full in my  record  of
       the proceedings. In reaching my conclusions and  making  findings  of
       fact I have taken into account all the oral and documentary  evidence
       even if I do not refer to all of it in this decision. At the  end  of
       the hearing I reserved my decision.

    8. In immigration cases the burden of  proof  generally  lies  upon  the
       appellant with respect to any assertions of fact which she makes. The
       standard of that proof is the balance of probabilities.

    9. With specific reference to Article 8, concerning the right to private
       and family life, it is for the appellant to show that, as at the date
       of the appeal hearing, she has established family and/or private life
       in the United Kingdom and  that  her  removal  as  a  result  of  the
       respondent's decision would interfere  with  one  or  both  of  those
       established rights in a significant way. It is for the respondent  to
       justify any interference caused. The respondent's decision must be in
       accordance with the law and amount to a proportionate response in the
       light of all the known factors and circumstances.

   10. I make the following findings of fact.

   11. The evidence was not the subject of serious challenge by Ms Fijiwala,
       who did not cross-examine the appellant and only asked Mr Grant a few
       questions. The reasons for refusal letter accepts there is a  genuine
       and subsisting relationship between the appellant and Mr Grant and Ms
       Fijiwala confirmed that was her stance also. I find as fact they have
       been in a long-term relationship and that they  have  lived  together
       since early 2013. They have now cohabited for more  than  two  years.
       They have discussed marriage but have not yet made  firm  plans.  The
       appellant is  now  46  years  of  age  and  has  resided  in  the  UK
       continuously since her arrival in October 2000. Mr Grant is a British
       citizen of Jamaican origin, aged 61. He came to the UK as  a  visitor
       in 2001 and was granted indefinite leave to remain in 2011.  He  then
       returned to Jamaica for a 4-week holiday to  see  his  grandchildren.
       The appellant has lost touch with her relatives in Jamaica. Mr  Grant
       would not consider relocating to Jamaica because he does not think he
       would be able to find employment at his age. He is  self-employed  in
       construction here and he supports the appellant. The  couple  have  a
       close circle of friends and relatives in the UK. They attend  church.
       The appellant is particularly close to her uncle, Carlton  (known  as
       "Tom"), who has cancer, and her cousin, Peggy, who has lupus. She has
       been seeing Carlton most days since his condition has  worsened.  The
       appellant has been studying on a catering course and  she  wishes  to
       complete her course.

   12. It is conceded the appellant does not meet the  requirements  of  the
       rules, which are designed to reflect  the  UK's  obligation  to  give
       effect to Article 8 of the Human Rights Convention.  The  reason  the
       rules are not met is that the appellant cannot meet the  requirements
       for 'partner', as discussed in my earlier decision.  Mrs  Heller  did
       not seek to argue the appellant had no ties with  Jamaica  given  she
       lived there for 30 years before coming to the UK. I have kept in mind
       the greater specificity given to aspects of the public  interest,  as
       revealed in the rules. The rules set clear indicators of what must be
       weighed in the balance and the importance to be given to the  factors
       set out in them.

   13. However, despite Ms Fijiwala's arguments to the contrary, I find this
       is a case in which it is necessary to proceed  to  the  second  stage
       assessment of Article 8 principles in line with European and domestic
       case law (Singh & Khalid v SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ 74). The correct test
       is  whether  there  are  compelling  circumstances  not  sufficiently
       recognised under the rules to require a grant of  leave  outside  the
       rules on the basis of Article 8. Ms Fijiwala  relied  on  SSHD  v  SS
       (Congo) & Ors [2015] EWCA Civ 387 in which the Court  held  that  the
       general  position  is  that  compelling  circumstances  need  to   be
       identified to support a claim for leave outside the rules. This is  a
       demanding test, reflecting the reasonable  relationship  between  the
       rules themselves and the proper outcome of the application of Article
       8 in the usual run of cases. When considering the question of whether
       leave should be granted under Article 8 I  should  give  considerable
       weight to the Secretary of State's view, as reflected in the rules.

   14. I find the key features of this case which  show  the  potential  for
       hardship  are  as  follows.  This  is  a  longstanding   relationship
       involving cohabitation  of  more  than  two  years.  The  appellant's
       difficulty with paragraph GEN.1.2 of Appendix FM  could  easily  have
       been surmounted by a quick marriage but Mr Grant explained  they  did
       not wish to rush into it for immigration purposes. Mr Grant is not in
       the first flush of youth and he has given a reasonable explanation as
       to why he  does  not  wish  to  relocate  to  Jamaica.  Removing  the
       appellant could potentially  lead  to  the  complete  destruction  of
       family  life  in  this  case.  In  my  view  these  are   exceptional
       circumstances which meet the demanding test described.

   15. I therefore come to the Article 8 assessment outside the  rules.  The
       appellant seeks to resist removal on the basis of her protected right
       to enjoy her private and family life in the UK. I  must  approach  my
       evaluation of this question in stages by reference to the five  steps
       set out in paragraph  17  of  Razgar  [2004]  UKHL  27,  an  approach
       confirmed in EB (Kosovo) [2008] UKHL 41. Those steps are as follows:

           Will the  proposed  removal  be  an  interference  by  a  public
           authority with the exercise of the applicant's right to  respect
           for his private or (as the case may be) family life?

           If so, will such interference have consequences of such  gravity
           as potentially to engage the operation of Article 8?

           If so, is such interference in accordance with the law?

           If so, is such interference necessary in a democratic society in
           the  interests  of  national  security,  public  safety  or  the
           economic well-being  of  the  country,  for  the  prevention  of
           disorder or crime, for the protection of health  or  morals,  or
           for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others?

           If so, is such  interference  proportionate  to  the  legitimate
           public end sought to be achieved?


   16.  This  is  a  case  in  which  the   determinative   issue   is   the
       proportionality of the decision. The appellant and Mr  Grant  plainly
       enjoy family life. I accept this is a serious, long-term relationship
       and that it shows the necessary degree of commitment and endurance to
       come within the concept of family life for the purposes of Article  8
       (Kroon v Netherlands (1995) EHRR 263).

   17. I do not think it is reasonable to expect Mr Grant to start again  in
       Jamaica in order to pursue family life there. Removing the  appellant
       as  a  consequence  of  the  decision  would  clearly  amount  to   a
       significant interference with the enjoyment of family life. I bear in
       mind that the requirement to show  a  significant  interference  with
       family or private life should not be  read  as  meaning  the  minimum
       level of severity required  is  a  special  or  high  one  (see,  for
       example, AG (Eritrea) [2007] EWCA Civ 801, paragraph 27).

   18. On the other hand, removing the appellant  would  be  lawful  in  the
       sense that it would be in accordance with the  Immigration  Acts  and
       Rules and would be in pursuit of the legitimate  aim  of  maintaining
       effective immigration controls, which is an aspect of the  prevention
       of disorder. Removal is necessary because there is no other means  of
       maintaining immigration controls in these circumstances.

   19.  I  come  to  proportionality.  My   approach   to   the   issue   of
       proportionality is guided by the House of Lords decision in Huang and
       Kashmiri [2007] UKHL 11. The ultimate question for me is whether  the
       refusal of leave to enter or remain, in the circumstances  where  the
       life of the family (or private life) cannot reasonably be expected to
       be enjoyed elsewhere,  taking  full  account  of  all  considerations
       weighing in favour of refusal, prejudices the family life (or private
       life) of the applicant in a manner sufficiently serious to amount  to
       a breach of  the  fundamental  right  protected  by  Article  8  (see
       paragraph 20). Decisions taken pursuant to the  lawful  operation  of
       immigration controls will be proportionate except in  small  minority
       of exceptional cases, identifiable on a case-by-case  basis  (Razgar,
       paragraph 20). However, that does not mean that there is a legal test
       of exceptionality or that any formula can be devised  to  ensure  the
       expectation that only a small  minority  of  cases  will  succeed  in
       practice (AG (Eritrea)). I have  therefore  assessed  the  degree  of
       interference  in  this  case  and  balanced  it  against  the  public
       expectation that the rules are applied.

   20. In assessing the public interest I must take account of  the  factors
       listed in section 117B of the 2002 Act, as follows:

           "117BArticle 8: public interest considerations applicable in all
           cases

           (1) The maintenance of effective immigration controls is in  the
           public interest.

           (2) It is in the public  interest,  and  in  particular  in  the
           interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that
           persons who seek to enter or remain in the  United  Kingdom  are
           able to speak English, because persons who can speak English-

                (a) are less of a burden on taxpayers, and

                (b) are better able to integrate into society.

           (3) It is in the public  interest,  and  in  particular  in  the
           interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that
           persons who seek to enter or remain in the  United  Kingdom  are
           financially independent, because such persons-

                (a) are not a burden on taxpayers, and

                (b) are better able to integrate into society.

           (4) Little weight should be given to-

                (a) a private life, or

                (b) a relationship formed with a qualifying partner,

           that is established by a person at a time when the person is  in
           the United Kingdom unlawfully.

           (5) Little weight should be given to a private life  established
           by a person at a time when the person's  immigration  status  is
           precarious.

           (6) ..."

   21. The appellant has explained how she sought to extend  her  leave  and
       also  that  she  was   ill-advised   in   the   initial   stages   by
       representatives who  were  subsequently  investigated  by  the  OISC.
       However, she has never been granted leave after entry  and  her  stay
       has always  been  at  best  precarious  and  at  worst  illegal.  She
       established her private life ties and, ultimately,  her  family  life
       ties with Mr Grant in the knowledge she might have to leave  the  UK.
       Accordingly, little weight can be given to it when  set  against  the
       public interest in  maintaining  immigration  controls.   accept  the
       appellant speaks English and is supported by Mr Grant. However, these
       matters do not weigh significantly against the public interest.

   22. Ms Fijiwala made submissions on the application to this case  of  the
       principles established in Chikwamba [2008] UKHL 40. In that case,  in
       considering the Home Office's policy of requiring people to  go  back
       to obtain entry clearance, which is set  out  in  paragraph  37,  the
       House of Lords overturned the decision of the Court of Appeal to  the
       effect  that  firm  immigration  control  required   consistency   of
       treatment between aspiring immigrants and waiving the requirement for
       prior entry clearance was unfair to others who were content  to  take
       their place in the entry clearance queue.

   23. Lord  Brown  described  the  real  rationale  behind  the  policy  as
       deterrence. He continued:

           "42. Now I would certainly not say that such an objective is  in
           itself necessarily objectionable. Sometimes, I accept,  it  will
           be reasonable and proportionate to  take  that  course.  Indeed,
           Ekinci still seems to me  just  such  a  case.  The  appellant's
           immigration history was appalling and he was being  required  to
           travel no further than to Germany and to wait for no longer than
           a month for a  decision  on  his  application.  Other  obviously
           relevant  considerations  will  be  whether,  for  example,  the
           applicant has arrived in this country illegally (say,  concealed
           in the back of a lorry) for good reason or  ill.  To  advance  a
           genuine asylum claim would, of course,  be  a  good  reason.  To
           enrol as a student would not. Also relevant  would  be  for  how
           long the Secretary of State has delayed in dealing with the case-
           see in this regard EB (Kosovo) v Secretary of State for the Home
           Department [2008] UKHL 41. In  an  Article  8  family  case  the
           prospective length and degree of family disruption  involved  in
           going abroad for an entry clearance certificate will  always  be
           highly relevant. And there may  be  good  reason  to  apply  the
           policy if the ECO abroad is better placed than  the  immigration
           authorities here to investigate the claim,  perhaps  as  to  the
           genuineness of a marriage  or  a  relationship  claimed  between
           family members, less good reason if the  policy  may  ultimately
           result in a second section 65 appeal  here  with  the  appellant
           abroad and unable therefore to give live evidence.

           43. As matters presently stand the published policy  appears  to
           apply routinely to all Article 8 family life cases  irrespective
           of whether or not the rules apply:

                "A person who claims that he  will  not  qualify  for  entry
                clearance under the rules is not in any better position than
                a person who  does  qualify  under  the  rules-he  is  still
                expected to apply for entry clearance ..."

           And for the reasons given  in  para  36  above  it  is,  indeed,
           entirely understandable why someone outside the rules should not
           be better off. Oddly, however, when  asked  to  explain  why  in
           those circumstances the appellant in Beoku-Betts v Secretary  of
           State for the Home Department [2008] UKHL 39, seeking to  remain
           here to enjoy family life with his emotionally dependent mother,
           was not first required to apply for entry clearance abroad,  the
           Secretary of State (in a post-hearing note) said:

                "Mr Betts did not ... on the face  of  it  fall  within  the
                scope of any relevant immigration rule  designed  to  enable
                him to enjoy family life in the  United  Kingdom.  In  those
                circumstances it was not argued that Mr Betts should  return
                to Sierra Leone to apply for entry  clearance  to  join  his
                family in the United Kingdom."

           I cannot reconcile that explanation with the stated policy.  Nor
           has any explanation been offered as to why the  policy  was  not
           applied also to the appellant Mr Kashmiri in Huang, who did  not
           qualify under a rule  requiring  entry  clearance  but  who  was
           asserting a family life claim to remain here under Article 8.

           44. I am far from suggesting that the Secretary of State  should
           routinely apply this policy in all but exceptional cases. Rather
           it seems to me that  only  comparatively  rarely,  certainly  in
           family cases involving children, should an Article 8  appeal  be
           dismissed on the basis that it would be proportionate  and  more
           appropriate for the appellant to apply for  leave  from  abroad.
           Besides the considerations already mentioned, it should be borne
           in mind that the  1999  Act  introduced  one-stop  appeals.  The
           Article 8 policy instruction is not easily reconcilable with the
           new streamlined approach. Where a  single  appeal  combines  (as
           often it does) claims both for asylum and for  leave  to  remain
           under Article 3 or Article 8, the  appellate  authorities  would
           necessarily have to dispose  substantively  of  the  asylum  and
           Article 3 claims. Suppose that these fail. Should the Article  8
           claim then be dismissed so that it can be advanced abroad,  with
           the prospect of a later, second section 65 appeal if  the  claim
           fails before the ECO (with the  disadvantage  of  the  appellant
           then being out of the country)? Better surely that in most cases
           the Article 8 claim be decided once and for all at  the  initial
           stage. If it is well founded, leave should be granted.  If  not,
           it should be refused."

   24. The facts of this appeal are different from those in that case.   The
       appellant came to the UK as a short-term visitor. She understood  the
       terms of her leave to enter.  Chikwamba  concerned  a  failed  asylum
       seeker from Zimbabwe, married to a  refugee  from  Zimbabwe,  with  a
       child of the marriage. That it was  disproportionate  to  expect  the
       appellant to return to Zimbabwe, with or  without  her  child,  where
       conditions were "harsh and unpalatable", and remain  there  for  some
       months in order to obtain entry clearance to return to the UK at  her
       own expense was overwhelmingly clear (paragraph  46;  see  also  Lord
       Scott). In contrast, the appellant in this case will have  to  remain
       in Jamaica for no more than a maximum of 90 days while an application
       for entry clearance is processed. 92% of applications  are  processed
       in 60 days. Mr Grant acknowledged he would be able to cope with  such
       a short separation and  he  also  has  the  option  of  visiting  the
       appellant during that time.

   25. The Court of Appeal in KH (Pakistan) v Secretary  of  State  for  the
       Home Department [2012] EWCA Civ 1054 confirmed that the assessment is
       fact-sensitive and emphasised that the House of Lords had  identified
       certain factors as potentially relevant,  including  the  prospective
       length and degree of disruption to  family  life  and  whether  other
       family members are settled in the UK. In R  (on  the  application  of
       Chen) v SSHD (Appendix  FM  -  Chikwamba  -  temporary  separation  -
       proportionality) IJR  [2015]  UKUT  00189  (IAC)  it  was  held  that
       Appendix FM does not include consideration of the question whether it
       would be disproportionate to expect an individual to  return  to  her
       home country to make an entry clearance application to re-join family
       members in the  UK.  There  may  be  cases  in  which  there  are  no
       insurmountable obstacles to family life being enjoyed outside the  UK
       but where temporary separation to enable an  individual  to  make  an
       application for entry  clearance  may  be  disproportionate.  In  all
       cases, it will be for the individual to place before the Secretary of
       State  evidence  that  such  temporary  separation   will   interfere
       disproportionately with protected rights.

   26. To answer the question whether there is a sensible reason to  enforce
       the policy, I note there is no evidence showing  that  the  financial
       requirements  of  Appendix   FM,   coupled   with   the   documentary
       requirements set  out  in  Appendix  FM-SE,  can  be  met.  There  is
       therefore very good reason to require the appellant to submit herself
       to the process of  applying  for  entry  clearance  so  that  a  full
       analysis of this point may  be  undertaken  by  the  entry  clearance
       officer. It would not be a 'futile  exercise'.  Temporary  separation
       for this purpose would not involve a  significant  interference  with
       family life currently enjoyed. I set little store by the  appellant's
       evidence that she could not be separated from her  uncle  or  cousin,
       both of whom are very unwell. It would be unfortunate that they would
       be deprived of the appellant's support which  they  no  doubt  value.
       However, her absence  can  be  assumed  to  be  temporary  while  she
       arranges her visa and it has not been  shown  there  would  be  harsh
       consequences for the individuals concerned.

   27. The respondent's decision to remove is proportionate  and  I  dismiss
       the appellant's appeal on Article 8 grounds.

NOTICE OF DECISION

    The appeal is dismissed.

    No anonymity direction has been made.






                               Signed   Date 14 August 2015


                               Judge Froom, sitting as a Deputy Judge of
                               the Upper Tribunal



                                  APPENDIX

    1. The respondent to this appeal is a citizen  of  Jamaica  born  on  12
       April 1969. The appellant is the Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
       Department, who has appealed with the permission  of  the  First-tier
       Tribunal against a decision  of  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
       Griffith, allowing the respondent's appeal against a decision of  the
       Secretary of State, dated 15 July 2014, to  remove  her  to  Jamaica,
       having refused her application for leave to remain  on  human  rights
       grounds. The Secretary of State refused the application for leave  on
       human rights grounds, having found Ms Isaacs could not succeed  under
       Appendix FM or paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration Rules, HC395,  and
       there were no exceptional circumstances for the purposes of Article 8
       of the Human Rights Convention.

    2. It is more convenient to refer to the parties as they were before the
       First-tier Tribunal. I shall therefore refer to Ms Isaacs from now on
       as "the appellant" and the Secretary of State as "the respondent".

    3. I was not asked and saw no reason to make an anonymity direction.

    4. The appellant arrived in the UK as a visitor on 6 October 2000,  aged
       31. Having overstayed her leave to enter she claimed asylum, although
       this was later denied by the appellant, who said the application  had
       been made without her knowledge. The appellant was  notified  of  her
       liability to removal  on  22  May  2007.  She  made  a  human  rights
       application on 25 March 20013 but this was refused on  22  June  2013
       without a right of appeal. Fresh representations were made on 20 July
       2013,  which  led  to  the  decision  now  appealed.  In  her   fresh
       representations, the appellant relied on her 12-year residence in the
       UK and her long-term relationship with Mr Franklyn Grant,  a  British
       citizen.

    5. At the appeal hearing before Judge Griffith, at which the  respondent
       was  not  represented,  submissions  were  made  to  the  effect  the
       appellant  fell  within  paragraph  EX.1  of  Appendix  FM   of   the
       Immigration Rules, HC395. It was argued  there  were  'insurmountable
       obstacles' to family life continuing outside the UK. Alternatively  a
       "freestanding" Article 8 assessment should be conducted  outside  the
       rules.

    6. The judge heard oral evidence from the appellant and from  Mr  Grant.
       She was told the appellant and Mr Grant  had  been  cohabiting  since
       2013 and that they planned to marry. The appellant thought she  would
       find it difficult to find work as a chef and Mr Grant did not want to
       live in Jamaica because of the violence. Mr Grant has adult  children
       in Jamaica. The judge found both  witnesses  credible.  She  accepted
       they were in a genuine and subsisting relationship and concluded they
       were partners for the purposes of paragraph GEN.1.2 of  Appendix  FM,
       although she did  not  say  why  she  reached  this  conclusion  (see
       paragraph 28). The judge therefore went on to consider whether  there
       were insurmountable obstacles to family life continuing  in  Jamaica.
       She set out the definition of 'insurmountable obstacles' provided  in
       paragraph EX.2 of the rules and directed  herself  in  terms  of  the
       guidance given in Izuazu (Article 8  -  new  rules)  [2013]  UKUT  45
       (IAC), a case promulgated before paragraph EX.2 was inserted into the
       rules.

    7. The judge began her consideration of the facts at paragraph  32.  She
       noted the appellant had been in the UK since 2000  and  for  most  of
       that time had not had leave. However, she appeared to have been badly
       served by her first legal representatives.  The  fact  she  had  made
       attempts to  regularise  her  stay  should  not  be  discounted.  The
       appellant was now 45 years of age and had been  absent  from  Jamaica
       for 14 years. There was no evidence she had ever returned  there  and
       the judge accepted the appellant had no close family  members  there.
       She plays a significant part in the  lives  of  her  extended  family
       members in the UK. There was  no  evidence  she  had  ever  practised
       deception or been in trouble with the police. Mr Grant was  60  years
       of age and had lived in the UK for 13 years. He had expressed concern
       that he would not be able to find work  in  Jamaica  and  he  had  no
       savings. It would not be reasonable to expect him to move to  Jamaica
       with the appellant. There was a risk Mr Grant would have no means  of
       supporting the appellant. The judge concluded, in paragraph 36,  that
       the difficulties the couple would face on return to Jamaica would  be
       very  considerable  and  would  involve  an  unreasonable  degree  of
       hardship. Therefore, the appellant succeeded under paragraph EX.1(c).
       In view of her finding on family life the judge did not go on to make
       findings under paragraph 276ADE.

    8. The grounds seeking permission to appeal argue  the  judge  erred  in
       finding the appellant met the requirements of  paragraph  GEN.1.2  of
       Appendix FM. It was unclear whether the judge found the appellant was
       a fianc�e. There was no evidence the couple planned to  marry  within
       six months (see  paragraph  D-ECP.1.1  of  Appendix  FM).  The  judge
       therefore erred in going on to look at paragraph  EX.1.  In  applying
       the test of insurmountable obstacles, the judge erred by  applying  a
       reasonableness test and, in any event, the found facts did not  reach
       the high threshold of insurmountable obstacles set out  in  paragraph
       EX.2.

    9. Designated First-tier Tribunal Judge  Coates  granted  permission  to
       appeal to argue both grounds.

   10. No rule 24 response has been filed on behalf of the appellant.

   11. I heard submissions as to whether the judge made a material error  of
       law. Ms Brocklesby-Weller's submissions followed the grounds  seeking
       permission to appeal. Ms Heller replied but effectively accepted  the
       judge erred in finding the appellant and Mr Grant were  partners  for
       the purposes of paragraph GEN.1.2. She  pointed  out  the  definition
       contains the phrase "unless the context otherwise requires" which had
       not, to her knowledge, been the subject of any guidance. She did  not
       press me to find this extension of the definition of 'partner' should
       apply, particularly as it was unclear on what  basis  the  judge  had
       found it did apply. Ms Heller did  not  argue  the  judge  must  have
       regarded them as fianc�s  given  the  definition  of  'fianc�'  found
       elsewhere in Appendix FM.

   12. I find the judge made a material  error  of  law  in  concluding  the
       couple were partners. The absence of reasons for this  conclusion  on
       her part is indicative of  her  misdirection.  At  the  time  of  the
       application, the couple had only been living together for a period of
       approximately 11 months. The definition in paragraph GEN.1.2  sets  a
       minimum period of cohabitation akin to marriage prior to the date  of
       application of two years. That test was plainly not met on the  facts
       found by the judge. She set out the evidence  in  paragraph  22  that
       they had lived together for about one and a half years. That  was  in
       November 2014 which means they began cohabiting in around  May  2013.
       The date of application was 23 April 2014.  The  error  was  material
       because, if the judge had found the couple were not  partners,  there
       would have been no consideration under  paragraph  EX.1.  The  appeal
       will have to be re-heard. The parties agreed this should  take  place
       in the Upper Tribunal.
