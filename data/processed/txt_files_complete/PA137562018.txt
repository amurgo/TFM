For the Appellant:     Mr J Frost, instructed by Migrant Legal Project
(Cardiff)
For the Respondent:    Mr C Howells, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 (SI 2008/2698) I/we make an anonymity  order.   Unless  the  Upper
    Tribunal or court directs otherwise, no  report  of  these  proceedings
    shall directly or indirectly identify the  appellant.   This  direction
    applies to both the appellant and to the respondent and  a  failure  to
    comply with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.

 2. This is the determination of the Upper Tribunal remaking  the  decision
    in respect of the appellant's international protection claim  following
    the decision of the Upper Tribunal (DUTJ J F  W  Phillips)  sent  on  9
    August 2019 setting aside  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    dismissing the appellant's appeal.

Introduction

 3. The appellant is a citizen of Iraq who comes from Kirkuk City.  He  was
    born on 10 February 1991.  He is Kurdish.

 4. The appellant came to the United Kingdom  in  March  2008  and  claimed
    asylum.  The basis of his claim  was  that  his  father  was  a  police
    officer in Kirkuk City and involved with the Ba'ath Party.  His  father
    had been killed and the appellant had subsequently been threatened.

 5. On 20 August 2009, the Secretary of State refused the appellant's claim
    for asylum.  The appellant appealed and, in a determination sent on  29
    August 2009, Judge Alakija dismissed  the  appellant's  appeal  on  all
    grounds.  Judge Alakija accepted that  the  appellant's  father  was  a
    police officer and a  member  of  the  Ba'ath  Party.   However,  Judge
    Alakija did not accept that the appellant had been targeted because  of
    his father's position and, as a consequence, the judge found  that  the
    appellant had not established that he would be at risk on return.

 6. The appellant made subsequent submissions which were  rejected  by  the
    Secretary of State and which, following a  number  of  judicial  review
    proceedings, resulted in a reconsideration.  On 12 November  2018,  the
    Secretary of State refused  the  appellant's  claim  for  international
    protection.

The Appeal to the First-Tier Tribunal

 7. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.  In a  determination
    sent on 1 April 2019, Judge Fowell dismissed  the  appellant's  appeal.
    The appellant did not pursue  any  asylum  claim  before  Judge  Fowell
    relying, instead, upon Article 15(c)  of  the  Qualification  Directive
    (Council Directive 2004/83/EC) and Articles 3 and 8 of the  ECHR.   The
    judge found that the level of risk of indiscriminate violence in Kirkuk
    City was not such as to  engage  Article  15(c)  of  the  Qualification
    Directive.  Further, the judge found that the  appellant  could  safely
    return to Kirkuk City via the IKR in possession of  a  laissez  passer.
    Judge Fowell further concluded that the appellant's removal  would  not
    breach Article 8 of the ECHR.

The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

 8. The appellant appealed to the Upper Tribunal.  Permission to appeal was
    granted by the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Feeney) on 7 May 2019.

 9. Following an error of law hearing on 11 July 2019, DUTJ J F W  Phillips
    allowed the appellant's appeal and set aside the decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal.  He was satisfied that Judge Fowell  had  erred  in  law
    departing from the (then) relevant country  guidance  decisions  in  AA
    (Iraq) v SSHD [2017] EWCA Civ 944  and  AAH  (Iraqi  Kurds  -  internal
    relocation) Iraq CG [2018] UKUT 212  (IAC).   Further,  the  judge  had
    erred in concluding that the appellant could safely  return  to  Kirkuk
    City using a laissez passer document which was not the required form of
    ID such as a Civil Status Identity Document ("CSID").   Judge  Phillips
    adjourned the appeal for a resumed hearing in  the  Upper  Tribunal  in
    order to remake the decision restricted to three issues:

        1. whether the appellant would be at real  risk  of  indiscriminate
           violence contrary to Art 15(c) in Kirkuk City;

        2. whether the appellant can safely return to Kirkuk City; and

        3. if the appellant cannot be returned to Kirkuk City whether there
           is an internal relocation alternative.

10. The appeal was further adjourned on 5 March 2020 as  the  parties  were
    not in a position to proceed.

11. Following that adjournment, in the light of the COVID-19 crisis the  UT
    issued directions for the further conduct of the  appeal.   Ultimately,
    on 24 August 2020 the UT (UTJ Sheridan) directed  that  the  appeal  be
    dealt with as a remote hearing.

12. Neither party objected to that direction and on 10  December  2020  the
    appeal was listed at the Cardiff Civil  Justice  Centre  for  a  remote
    hearing by Skype for Business.  I was based in court with Mr Frost, who
    represented  the  appellant,  and  Mr  Howells,  who  represented   the
    Secretary of State, joining the hearing by  Skype.   In  addition,  the
    appellant joined the hearing by Skype and gave oral evidence through an
    interpreter who also joined the hearing by Skype.

The Issues

13. The respresentatives identified the issues in their respective skeleton
    arguments produced by Mr Frost (dated 10 December 2020) and Mr  Howells
    (dated 14 May 2020).  As a result of a number of  points  made  orally,
    the issues identified by Judge Phillips were narrowed down.

          1. Has the appellant established that in Kirkuk City he would  be
             exposed  to  a  real  risk  of  serious  harm   arising   from
             indiscriminate violence  contrary  to  Article  15(c)  of  the
             Qualification Directive?

          2. Can the appellant safely return and travel to Kirkuk City  and
             live there safely with the necessary documentation such  as  a
             CSID, an Iraqi Nationality Identity Document ("INID")  or,  as
             the respondent contends, a 'Registration Document (1957)'?

          3. Although Judge Phillips identified as a third  issue  that  if
             the appellant could not safely live in Kirkuk  City  could  he
             internally  relocate,  Mr  Howells  in  his  oral  submissions
             conceded that the Secretary of State did not contend that  the
             appellant could internally relocate either to Baghdad  or  the
             IKR.  That, therefore was not an issue before me.

          4. It is unclear to what extent the appellant can, or does,  rely
             upon Article 8 of the ECHR.  Judge Fowell dismissed his appeal
             on that basis and his adverse finding was  not  challenged  in
             the grounds of appeal.  That is  clear  from  Judge  Phillips'
             decision which does not identify Article 8 as an issue  to  be
             determined by the UT in  remaking  the  decision.   Mr  Frost,
             however, raised Article  8  in  paragraphs  47  -  49  of  his
             skeleton argument.  However, he made no  oral  submissions  in
             relation to Article 8.  Indeed, Article 8 was  not  raised  in
             the submissions of either representative.

The Law

14. In relation to the  appellant's  humanitarian  protection  claim  under
    Article 15(b), the appellant must establish that there are  substantial
    grounds for believing that if returned to Iraq there  is  a  real  risk
    that he would suffer serious harm contrary to Article 15(b).

15. Likewise, in relation to Article 15(c)  the  appellant  must  establish
    that there are substantial grounds for believing that  if  returned  to
    Iraq there is a real risk that he would suffer serious harm as a result
    of indiscriminate violence.

16. In relation to Article 3, the appellant must establish that  on  return
    to Iraq there are substantial grounds for believing  that  there  is  a
    real risk that he would be  subjected  to  torture  or  to  inhuman  or
    degrading treatment or punishment.

The Evidence

17. The appellant put into evidence a substantial bundle of documents.  The
    documents relied upon by Mr Frost were principally the following:  five
    witness statements from the appellant dated 2 October 2009 (E15 -  18),
    11 May 2017 (E14), 23 August 2018 (E12 - 13), 14 March 2019 (E8  -  11)
    and 27 February  2020  (E1  -  2).   In  addition,  he  relied  upon  a
    translation of an Iraqi government document concerned with the issue of
    CSIDs in Kirkuk (F2 - 3).  Further, he relied  upon  a  statement  from
    Mark Shepherd from Migrant Legal Project dated 3 February 2020  (E47  -
    48).  Mr Frost also relied upon the two  psychiatric  reports  from  Dr
    Buttan and Dr Battersby dated 15 March 2019 (E20 -  46)  and  22  March
    2020 respectively.  Finally, Mr Frost relied upon a number  of  country
    background documents in Section F of the appellant's  bundle:  iMMAP  -
    Iraq Humanitarian Response (Jan - August 2020) (F5 -  11);  and  Middle
    East Institute, ISIS's dramatic escalation in Syria  and  Iraq  (4  May
    2020) (F30 - 32) in relation to the risk of indiscriminate violence  in
    Kirkuk.  The file also contained an expert report from Dr R Fatah dated
    3 April 2020.  This report relates to a  different  individual  to  the
    appellant and Mr Frost neither placed reliance upon it nor did he  draw
    it to my attention at the hearing or in his skeleton argument.

18.  Mr  Howells  relied  on  the   CPIN,   "Internal   Relocation,   Civil
    Documentation and Returns, Iraq" (June 2020) ("CPIN  (June  2020)")  in
    relation to documentation.  He also relied upon a  translation  of  the
    death certificate of the appellant's father (page 11 of the appellant's
    bundle) setting out, Mr Howells' submitted, the family book details  of
    the appellant's father.

19. Both representatives relied upon,  and  referred  me  to,  the  country
    guidance decision of SMO and others (Article 15(c); identity documents)
    Iraq CG [2019] UKUT 400 (IAC) (hereafter "SMO").

20. All the new material was admitted under rule  15(2A)  of  the  Tribunal
    Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (SI 2008/2698 as amended) without
    objection from either representative.

The Appellant's Evidence

21. At Mr Frost's invitation, and with Mr Howells' concurrence,  given  the
    evidence about the appellant's mental health  I  agreed  to  treat  the
    appellant as a vulnerable witness within the Presidential Guidance Note
    No  2  of  2010,  "Child,  Vulnerable  Adult  and  Sensitive  Appellant
    Guidance".  I told the appellant that, if  during  the  course  of  his
    evidence he wished to have a break, he should indicate that to me.   Mr
    Frost indicated, based upon the medical evidence,  that  the  appellant
    might become agitated when giving his evidence.  In the result,  I  did
    not discern the appellant doing so and the appellant did  not  ask  for
    any breaks during the period in which he gave his evidence.

22. In his oral evidence, the appellant was unable formally  to  adopt  his
    written statements other  than  the  most  recent  statement  dated  27
    February 2020.  He said he could not recall  his  previous  statements.
    The appellant appears to have been in a similar position  before  Judge
    Fowell where, as the judge pointed out in paragraph 20,  he  remembered
    his recent statement but struggled  to  adopt  his  earlier  statements
    saying he could not remember them.  Before me, it was  agreed  that  if
    any matter in his earlier statements was put to the appellant, then  it
    should be clearly read out to the appellant.  As  will  be  clear,  the
    appellant does, in fact, dispute the contents, to some extent,  of  his
    earlier statements in relation to what is said about continuing contact
    with his family in Iraq.

23. In cross-examination, the appellant was asked whether he had been in  a
    relationship in the UK with a Polish woman between 2017 and  2018.   He
    confirmed that he had and that they had communicated with each other in
    English.  He also agreed that he had been to college in the UK for four
    years and had been taught in English.

24. The appellant was asked about his relatives in Iraq  when  he  left  in
    2008.  He agreed that he had left behind his mother,  two  sisters  and
    maternal uncle.  He agreed that he had  other  relatives  in  Iraq  but
    because of his father's involvement with the Ba'ath Party, his   family
    were unhappy and he had no relationship with them.  He said that he had
    last been in contact with his family in Iraq a "very  long  time  ago".
    He could not remember exactly but then said it was 2009 - 2010.  He had
    then been in contact with his mother.  He was  asked  why  he  had  not
    mentioned that he had lost contract with his mother in  his  statements
    in 2017 and 2018.  He replied that he had not been asked about that and
    he had only answered what he had been asked about.  He  said  that,  in
    relation to his statements, he had told his solicitor when he had  last
    had contact with his family.

25. The appellant was asked why in his 2017 statement (at para 4),  he  had
    said that his mother and sisters lived in Kirkuk but he  did  not  know
    where and why did he know, then, that they were still in Kirkuk  if  he
    had had no contact with them since 2009 - 2010.  He replied  that  when
    he had been asked about this, he had told his representatives  that  he
    had been in contact with them in Kirkuk but did not  know  now  whether
    they were alive or not.

26. The appellant was asked why in his statement he had said in relation to
    his mother that he was "occasionally in contact".  He said that he  had
    mentioned that he lost contact with his mother in 2009 -  2010  because
    of a problem concerning his sister's marriage.  He had never said  that
    he was in contact with his mother "occasionally".  He said  that  might
    have been an interpretation problem.  He was asked why in  paragraph  6
    of his statement in 2017 he had given detail  concerning  his  mother's
    health including that she had been hospitalised with a heart attack and
    he had lost contact with her in 2009  -  2010.   He  replied  that  his
    answer related to what he knew when he was last  in  contact  with  her
    even though it was in the present tense.

27. The appellant was asked about  his  maternal  uncle  and  when  he  had
    discovered that he was dead.  He said he had discovered  that  in  2010
    when he was in contact with  his  mother.   Two  weeks  later  he  lost
    contact with his family.  He was asked why he had only  mentioned  that
    his uncle was dead in his 2020 statement.  And why, given he  had  made
    four statements, attended an  appeal  hearing  in  Birmingham  and  had
    spoken to two doctors all since 2010, he had made  no  mention  of  the
    fact that his uncle had died.  He replied that he had  not  been  asked
    about his uncle and at the appeal he had  been  asked  questions  about
    matters years apart.  He said that he had  not  had  contact  with  his
    uncle for ten years.

28. The appellant was asked about his answer  in  his  screening  interview
    which gave his address in Kirkuk.  He agreed that was the address  from
    fifteen years ago.  When he was asked why he could  not  write  to  his
    family at that address, he replied "from where?" He then said  that  he
    not only gave his address but submitted to  the  Home  Office  all  the
    proofs about his father.

29. The appellant was asked why, if the judge in his 2009  appeal  had  not
    believed he was telling the truth on all aspects of his  asylum  claim,
    why he should be believed now.  The appellant  said,  in  a  number  of
    answers, that he was being honest  and had told  the  truth.   He  said
    that if he was not believed, he could not make anyone believe him.   He
    was honest.

30. The appellant was asked about a document (Iraqi NID card) that he  said
    in his screening interview in 2008 (at 9.2 and  9.3)  he  had  left  in
    Iraq.  He said that a CSID was like an ID in his country.  He was asked
    whether he had one of these documents and  he  said  he  did  not  know
    because back home he did not keep his ID as he was  a  child.   He  was
    asked whether he needed his CSID  for work and study in Iraq.  He  said
    he did not need a CSID for his work and for study, he was a  child  and
    his parents had ID.  Asked whether he had any ID documents in  Iraq  he
    said "I don't know".  He said that  he  was   being  asked  about  what
    happened fifteen years ago and that was very  difficult  for  him.   As
    regards the Iraqi NID card that he said he had left at his mother's and
    which he said was a renewed document issued in Kirkuk in 2004, he  said
    that he could not remember talking about it.  He said he  did  not  now
    remember that document.  He was asked why his family  in  Kirkuk  could
    not send that original document to him, the appellant said he  was  not
    in contact with his family and so who was he supposed to ask.

31. The appellant was asked a number of questions about his mental  health.
    He was asked whether he last took any medication for his mental  health
    and he said he had been to see a doctor about a month or so ago and  he
    had been given tablets to  calm him down and help him to sleep.  He had
    a blood test and a few weeks ago but had not received the results back.
     He said that he had received counselling but not continuously  -  only
    two sessions.  He said he could not handle it and he was told not to go
    back.  The last session was on 21 March 2020 at 11.30am in Plymouth.

32. The appellant was asked how many years he had spent in school  in  Iraq
    and he said seven years - something like that.  He was asked why he had
    said that he had hoped to become a doctor or architect when talking  to
    Dr Buttan.  He said he enjoyed school and he was good at school  before
    Saddam was toppled.  Even in this country he had been doing  very  well
    he said.  He agreed that he had certificates in this country in English
    and computer skills.  He said college had been free but now he  had  to
    pay for it and it was expensive and he could not afford it.

33. As regards work, he said that he had worked as a carpenter in Iraq with
    his uncle but no-one else.  In the UK he had volunteered  in  a  coffee
    shop that helped volunteers by serving food.  When it was  pointed  out
    to him that he had told Dr Battersby that he  had  done  jobs  such  as
    painting, gardening and helping in a shop, he agreed and said how  else
    was he expected to live.  When it was put to him that his mental health
    had not stopped him studying or working in the UK, the  appellant  said
    that he was not up to studying anymore and that he could not settle  in
    the job.  He would do one for two days then quit and  then  do  another
    one.

34. Finally, when it was pointed out him that the UK authorities would,  on
    his voluntary return to Iraq, pay him �1,500, the appellant  said  that
    he had no family, no ID, nothing and he had been living in the  UK  for
    thirteen years.  He had no-one in Iraq and what was he supposed  to  do
    with �1,500.

35.  In  re-examination,  the  appellant  was  asked  about  his   evidence
    concerning the detail of his mother's  health  which  he  gave  in  his
    witness statement in 2007.  He said that he had learnt about her health
    before he had lost contact with  his family.  He said he had only  been
    asked about his mother in 2017.

The Submissions

     The Respondent

36. I will deal  with  Mr  Howells'  submissions  as  follows:  first,   in
    relation to findings based upon the appellant's evidence; secondly, the
    Art 15(c) issues; and thirdly, the risk on return based upon an absence
    of documentation.

37. As regards the appellant's evidence, both in his oral  submissions  and
    in paragraph 14 of his skeleton argument, Mr Howells invited me to make
    an adverse credibility finding and conclude that the appellant was  not
    to be believed that he had lost contact with his family in Iraq or,  if
    he had, I should find that he could re-establish contact with them.

38. First, Mr  Howells  submitted  that  I  should  treat  the  appellant's
    evidence with caution.  He had been found not to be  wholly  honest  by
    Judge Alakija in his 2009 appeal.

39. Secondly, on his evidence, the appellant had lost contact with his four
    relatives in Iraq in 2009 - 2010 but had not mentioned that  until  his
    2019 appeal statement.  In between, Mr Howells submitted, he had made a
    number of statements without mentioning it.  Mr Howells relied upon the
    appellant's evidence in  his  2017  statement  where  he  said  he  had
    "occasional" contact with his mother.  He  had  also  referred  to  his
    mother's health condition clearly in the  present  tense.   Mr  Howells
    submitted that  the  statement  from  his  legal  representative,  Mark
    Shepherd went nowhere near  explaining  why  the  appellant  repeatedly
    referred to his family in the present tense in his evidence and did not
    raise the fact that he had lost  contact  with  them  until  2019.   Mr
    Howells reminded me that the appellant's English was good; his evidence
    was that he had a Polish partner who whom he communicated in English.

40. Thirdly, as regards  the  death  of  his  maternal  uncle,  Mr  Howells
    submitted that the first time that the appellant mentioned this was  in
    his February 2020 statement despite his evidence being  that  he  found
    out in 2010 that his uncle had died.  Mr  Howells  submitted  that  the
    appellant had given no credible explanation why it took him  ten  years
    to refer to his uncle having died.  He had  made  statements  in  2017,
    2018 and 2019 without mentioning it.  He had not  mentioned  it  to  Dr
    Buttan or to Dr Battersby.  There was no mention of it  at  the  appeal
    hearing in March 2019 before Judge Fowell.   This  was  his  last  male
    relative in Iraq and it was not credible that it  would  take  him  ten
    years to mention it.

41. Mr Howells invited me to  find  that,  not  only  was  the  appellant's
    mother, uncle and sister still living in Kirkuk, but also that  he  was
    able to contact them.

42. Mr Howells submitted that, with such a finding, I should also  conclude
    that the appellant could obtain ID documents from his family in Iraq.

43. As regards the appellant's claim under Art 15(c), Mr Howells  submitted
    that in SMO, the Upper Tribunal had concluded that there was in general
    no risk to civilians of indiscriminate violence engaging Art 15(c).  He
    referred me to the evidence at [25] - [50] and the Tribunal's  findings
    at [251] - [257].

44. Mr Howells submitted that the issue was whether, applying the 'sliding-
    scale' assessment, the appellant had established an Art 15(c) risk.  Mr
    Howells submitted, referring to [313] of SMO, that the appellant  could
    not could not establish a relevant personal characteristic  based  upon
    his opposition to the government of Iraq or IKR or that  he  was  in  a
    minority.  The former did not arise on the facts as he was not a critic
    and, in Kirkuk City as a Sunni Kurd, he as not in a minority but  in  a
    substantial part of the population.

45. The only potentially relevant characteristic,  Mr  Howells'  submitted,
    was the appellant's "disability", i.e. his mental health.   Mr  Howells
    relied upon  the  absence  of  any  evidence  of  treatment  which  the
    appellant was receiving under  the  NHS  for  his  mental  health.   He
    accepted that Dr Buttan in her report, which was twenty months old, had
    concluded  that  the  appellant  was  suffering  from  mild  PTSD   and
    adjustment disorder - mixed anxiety and depressive reaction.   However,
    the appellant was not taking any medication or any therapy for it.   He
    had not received any medication as Dr Buttan's  report  envisaged.   As
    regards Dr Battersby's more recent report in March 2020, she noted that
    the appellant was not  currently taking any medication as  he  did  not
    like any side effects and he had not  had  any  counselling.   She  had
    diagnosed him as suffering from moderate PTSD and  moderate  depressive
    disorder.  As regards Dr Battersby's observation that  the  appellant's
    risk of suicide was at its highest at a time when he might be  informed
    of his deportation, Mr Howells confirmed that  in  those  circumstances
    appropriate measures would be taken to reduce any risk of self-harm  or
    suicide.  He submitted that on his return to Iraq, the appellant  would
    have family in Kirkuk with whom he could live.  He  was  not  receiving
    any medication and, in considering whether he was  at  'enhanced'  risk
    under Art 15(c), the evidence was that he had no physical  disabilities
    and he said he did not go out very much.  Mr Howells submitted that  it
    was difficult to see how, even taking the  evidence  about  his  mental
    health problems at its highest, that the  level  of  risk  required  to
    engage Art 15(c) was reached

46. As regards the issue concerning the appellant's risk on return  without
    documentation,  Mr  Howells  acknowledged  that,  following  SMO,   the
    appellant  would  be  at  risk  if  he  returned  without  relevant  ID
    documentation.

47. First, Mr Howells pointed out that the appellant said he had left an ID
    card with his mother in Iraq.  It was unclear whether that was a  CSID.
    He was in contact with his family and could obtain this.

48. Secondly, as regards replacement documentation, Mr Howells accepted  in
    the light of the recent CPIN (June 2020) that it was unlikely that  the
    appellant could obtain a replacement CSID from the Iraqi Embassy in the
    UK even though, from his father's death certificate, he would have  the
    relevant information concerning his family's records.  Mr Howells  also
    accepted that the appellant could not obtain an INID from the Embassy -
    that was a biometric document which could only be obtained from a local
    CSA office.  However, Mr Howells submitted that it was unclear from SMO
    whether the CSA office in Kirkuk City had moved from issuing  CSIDs  to
    only issuing INIDs.  He accepted that the UT had  said  it  was  likely
    that the office in Kirkuk only issued  INIDs  now  (at  [430])  but  Dr
    Fatah's evidence (set out at [369]) was that a CSID could  be  obtained
    in Kirkuk which was in his evidence in June 2019.  Mr Howells, however,
    accepted that the appellant's evidence, set out  at  F1  -  F4  of  the
    bundle, showed that INIDs were being issued in Kirkuk.

49. Thirdly, therefore, Mr Howells relied upon the CPIN  (June  2020)  that
    acknowledged that a person could obtain from the Iraqi Embassy  in  the
    UK a 'Registration Document (1957)' as a step to obtaining  a  CSID  or
    INID from their local CSA office in Iraq.  He acknowledged that the  UT
    in SMO had not considered whether the  'Registration  Document  (1957)'
    was an ID document which allowed an individual to safely travel  within
    Iraq.  He submitted, however, that in SMO at [361] the  Upper  Tribunal
    had recognised that the 'Registration  Document  (1957)'  was  a  civil
    status document.  There was, he acknowledged, a  gap  in  the  evidence
    concerning a person's ability to use this document to travel.  However,
    he submitted it was most unlikely that the Iraqi  Embassy  would  issue
    such a document as a step to obtaining a CSID or INID in  a  local  CSA
    office if it was not intended  that  that  person  could  travel  there
    safely to obtain one of those  documents.   Otherwise,  the  individual
    would be stranded in Baghdad unable to travel.

50. Mr Howells, therefore, invited me to dismiss the appellant's appeal  on
    humanitarian protection grounds and under Art 3 of the ECHR.

    The Appellant

51. Mr Frost relied upon his written detailed skeleton  argument  which  he
    developed relatively briefly in his oral submissions.

52. First, as regards the appellant's evidence, he invited me to accept the
    appellant's evidence that he had lost contact with his family in  Iraq.
    He asked me to bear in mind the appellant's level of English  and  that
    he was a vulnerable witness.  He relied upon the  statement  from  Mark
    Shepherd explaining the omission to  mention,  in  earlier  statements,
    that the  appellant  had  lost  contact  with  his  family.   Mr  Frost
    submitted that it was not crucial, in all the circumstances,  that  the
    appellant sometimes was  recorded  as  using  the  present  tense  when
    referring to his family.  In relation to the rejection of  his  earlier
    asylum claim, Mr Frost submitted that the judge had not disbelieved the
    whole of the appellant's claim.  The appellant had said that he did not
    accept that he had given false evidence previously but  his  claim  had
    now moved on and there was no  fresh  evidence  so  it  was  no  longer
    pursued.

53. In relation to Art 15(c), Mr Frost placed reliance upon  the  'sliding-
    scale' assessment set out in  SMO.   He  relied  upon  the  appellant's
    personal circumstances, in particular his mental health.  He  submitted
    that this put the appellant at enhanced risk.  He relied upon the  EASO
    2019 Report (at F121 -  122)  of  the  bundle  referring  to  "societal
    discrimination", a lack of health services in Iraq and, in  particular,
    services for mental health did not meet demand.   He  relied  upon  the
    report statement that:

         "records that there is sadly discrimination,  inadequate  provision
         of healthcare and a high risk  of  violence,  particularly  against
         those with mental illness".

    He accepted that there was no evidence of treatment being given to  the
    appellant for his mental health within the NHS but he relied  upon  the
    two psychiatric reports and the diagnosis that the  appellant  suffered
    from  moderate  PTSD  and  adjustment  disorder  -  mixed  anxiety  and
    depressive reaction.  He also relied upon Dr Battersby's  comment  that
    the appellant was at a moderately high risk of suicide if he  returned.
    Mr Frost submitted that the appellant would have no family  to  support
    him on return.  In addition, he relied upon the background evidence, in
    particular at F1 - 4, F5 - 11 and F30 - 32 of increased  ISIS  activity
    and increased security threat in recent months.  Applying the 'sliding-
    scale', Mr Frost submitted that the  appellant  reached  the  threshold
    under Art 15(c).

54. Thirdly, in relation to  documentation  Mr  Frost  submitted  that  the
    appellant does not  have  a  CSID  or  INID.   He  submitted  that  the
    appellant could not obtain either document from the  Iraqi  Embassy  in
    the UK and he relied  upon  the  CPIN  at  para  2.6.17.   Further,  he
    submitted that on the basis of the evidence  concerning  the  issue  of
    INIDs by the appellant's local CSA office in Kirkuk  City,  his  family
    could not obtain a CSID from that office and he would have to apply  in
    person to obtain an INID.  Mr Frost  submitted  that  the  respondent's
    proposal that the appellant  should  obtain  a  'Registration  document
    (1957)' from the  Iraqi  Embassy  in  the  UK  which  would  allow  the
    appellant to travel within Iraq was speculation not  supported  by  the
    evidence.  Mr Frost invited me to find that the appellant does not have
    a relevant ID document, and could not obtain one before return to Iraq,
    that would allow him to travel safely to Kirkuk from Baghdad  to  which
    he would be returned.

55. In those circumstances, Mr Frost invited me  to  allow  the  appeal  on
    humanitarian protection grounds under Art 15(b)  of  the  Qualification
    Directive and Art 3 of the ECHR.

Discussions and Findings

     The Outstanding Factual Issue

56. The appellant's case is that he left his family in Kirkuk City in  2008
    when he came to the UK - that was  his  mother,  his  two  sisters  and
    maternal uncle.  His case now is that he has not been in  contact  with
    any of them since 2009 - 2010 and, in fact, he discovered in 2010  that
    his maternal uncle had been killed.

57. On this issue, I  do  not  accept  the  appellant's  evidence  for  the
    following reasons.

58. First, the appellant has not relied upon a crucial part  of  his  claim
    until,  at the earliest, 2018.  The appellant did not mentioned that he
    had lost contact with his family in his written  statement  of  11  May
    2017. Even then he made no reference to having lost contact as long ago
    as 2009-2010 as he now claims.  The first possible disclosure is in his
    2018 statement when he said that he had  "not  had  contact"  with  his
    family since his last (i.e. 2017) statement.  That is not  an  explicit
    statement that he has lost contact, certainly from when he  now  claims
    in 2009-2010.  Indeed, it appears to only relate to a period since  the
    2017 statement.  The loss of contact is not  made  explicit  until  his
    statement of 2019 where he says he has "no contact with  my  family  in
    Kirkuk for a long time" and it is not until his February 2020 statement
    that he says specifically that he has had no contact with  them  "since
    2009 or 2010".

59. Indeed, in his statement of 11 May 2017 the  appellant  said  something
    inconsistent with his claim that he had already lost contact  with  his
    family.  There, in paragraph 4 he said this: "My mother and two sisters
    still live in Kirkuk but I do not  know  where.   My  sisters  are  now
    married and I am not in contact with them.  My mother is elderly.  I am
    occasionally in contact with her."  He refers to  his  family,  in  the
    present tense, as still living in Kirkuk  and  he  specifically  states
    that he is "occasionally in contact"  with  his  mother.   Further,  in
    paragraph 6 he gives  a  number  of  details  concerning  his  mother's
    health, including that she has diabetes and a heart  condition  and  he
    has learnt that she was hospitalised with a heart attack.

60. The appellant contests what is said in his May 2017 statement  that  he
    was "occasionally in contact" with his  mother.   In  his  most  recent
    statement of February 2020 he says that  his  earlier  statements  were
    given where no interpreter was present.  He  states  that  although  he
    does speak and understand English  to  a  reasonable  extent,  he  does
    "struggle and have concatenation problems".  He says  that  it  is  not
    correct to say that he was, at the time of his statement,  occasionally
    in contact with his mother.  He states: "I was  in  occasional  contact
    with her up until 2010 when our relationship broken down".  In his oral
    evidence, the appellant stated that he had never said that  he  was  in
    contact  with  his  mother  occasionally  -  that  may  have  been   an
    interpreter problem.  He said that what he had said about  his  mother,
    and her health, was what he had learnt when  he  was  in  contact  with
    them.  He said that he was not in contact with them now and he did  not
    know whether they were alive or dead.

61. In addition, the appellant relies upon a  witness  statement  from  his
    legal representative, Mark Shepherd dated 3  February  2020.   In  that
    statement he states that  he  previously  took  instructions  from  the
    appellant in English in 2015, 2017 and  2018  including  preparing  the
    short statements of the appellants in 2017 and 2018.  At paras 5  -  6,
    Mr Shepherd says this:

         "5.  I became aware when preparing his  appeal  in  2019  that  the
             appellant had poor  mental  health  which  was  affecting  his
             concentration, particularly in a second  language,  and  so  I
             decided to prepare his appeal with a Sorani  interpreter.   In
             reviewing  those  previous  statements  prepared  without   an
             interpreter (2017 and  2018)  it  became  clear  there  was  a
             factual error with regard  to  his  contact  with  his  mother
             (please see appellant's statement dated 27/02/2020).

         6.   I am preparing this statement as I hope that he Tribunal  will
             not prejudice the  appellant.   It  was  our  mistake  in  not
             preparing all this (sic) statements with a Sorani  interpreter
             to ensure their accuracy."

62. It is important to see what Mr Shepherd says and what he does not  say.
    He attests that a  mistake  was  made  in  the  earlier  statements  in
    referring to the appellant as  having  said  he  was  "occasionally  in
    contact" with his mother  (the  2017  statement)  and,  presumably,  in
    failing to mention in that statement (and apparently accepting the same
    in respect of the 2018 statement) that the appellant had  lost  contact
    with his family.  He says that the mistake arose, in effect, due to the
    absence of an interpreter.   That  explanation  does  not  explain  the
    complete omission of a matter which, as must have  always  been  clear,
    was crucial to the appellant's claim, namely whether he has any  family
    in Kirkuk who could assist him on return or, potentially, assist him in
    obtaining documentation  to  return  safely.   Mr  Shepherd  offers  no
    explanation as to how the absence of an interpreter led to that  matter
    not being addressed at all.

63. As regards the specific statement made by the  appellant  in  his  2017
    witness statement that  he  was  "occasionally  in  contact"  with  his
    mother, that has obviously not in itself been mistranslated.  At  least
    in his most recent written statement the appellant does not  deny  that
    he was occasionally in contact with his mother but states that  it  was
    before he lost contact with her in 2009-2010.  In  his  oral  evidence,
    the appellant was a little more emphatic but he had never said that  he
    had been in contact with his mother "occasionally"

64. In assessing these explanations, I bear in mind that the appellant  was
    legally represented throughout.  Mr Shepherd's statement post-dates the
    hearing before Judge Fowell in March 2019 when  it  was  very  much  in
    issue what if any contact the appellant had with his family in Iraq.  I
    have no doubt that Mr Shepherd is relaying, via his written  statement,
    the appellant's instructions that he did  not  say  what  is  contained
    within his 2017 statement.  Mr Shepherd does not, however, specifically
    state, as drifted in and out of the appellant's oral answers, that  the
    reason why it is not stated that the appellant had  lost  contact  with
    his family is because he was never asked about that.  It  is  difficult
    to understand how, over the course of more than ten  year'  litigation,
    the important fact about whether the appellant  has  contact  with  his
    family in Iraq - if it is the case - was not mentioned in 2017 and  was
    not fully articulated until his 2020 statement.  If, as  the  appellant
    claims, he lost contact with his family in  2009  -  2010,  I  find  it
    highly improbable that that he would not have raised it earlier so that
    it would  have  emerged  and  found  a  prominent  place  in  his  many
    statements that he has given since 2010.

65.  Secondly,  Mr  Howells  placed  some  weight  on  the  fact  that  the
    appellant's statements refer to his  family  in  Iraq  in  the  present
    tense.  The appellant's explanation as to how he came to  be  referring
    to his family's circumstances in the present tense including the detail
    of his mother's health, despite having no contact with  them  for  some
    years is not plausible. Although that is  not  a  determinative  factor
    bearing in mind that the appellant was either  giving  his  account  in
    English or through an interpreter, it nevertheless merits some weight.

66. Thirdly, in his statement in 2018 the appellant does  acknowledge  that
    he has had no  contact  with  his  family  since  his  last  statement.
    However, his account given there is inconsistent with what he now says,
    namely that he lost contact with them  in 2009-2010.  In para 6 of  his
    2018 statement he says: "I have not had contact with my family in  Iraq
    since my last statement.  I currently have no contact with  any  family
    member in Iraq." This is not susceptible to  a  nuanced  reading.   The
    appellant is explicitly saying he has had no  contact  since  his  last
    statement.  He is not saying he has had no contact since 2009-2010.

67. Fourthly, it is striking that the appellant's failed to  mention  until
    his 2020 statement that he has known since 2010 that his maternal uncle
    is dead.  He makes no mention of that in any of his witness  statements
    or indeed in what he said to Dr Buttan or Dr Battersby.  Further, it is
    not, however, as if he did not  refer  to  his  uncle  in  his  earlier
    statements.  His uncle is, for example,  extensively  referred  to  his
    2019 witness statement, not least in the role he  played  in  assisting
    the appellant to leave Iraq.  At  no point does the appellant say  that
    he discovered in 2010 that his uncle had been killed.  This  is  raised
    for the first time in his  statement  of  February  2020.   Remarkably,
    before Judge Fowell at the March 2019 appeal hearing, it was  also  not
    raised by the appellant nor was it claimed by  him  that  he  knew  his
    uncle was dead having been told in  2010  despite  the  fact  that  the
    appellant was cross-examined about his uncle  (see  para  21  of  Judge
    Fowell's determination).

68. In reaching my conclusions on this issue I bear in mind  the  evidence,
    to which I will refer to later, in relation to the  appellant's  mental
    health in the reports of Dr Buttan and Dr Battersby.  I  also  bear  in
    mind what is said by Mr Shepherd in his  witness  statement.   However,
    nothing in that material  leads  me  to  conclude  that  there  is  any
    satisfactory explanation as to why the appellant failed to mention that
    he had lost contact with his family in 2009-2010 and, at that time,  he
    had discovered that his maternal uncle had died.  There is no  credible
    explanation why it took him ten years to specifically state that he had
    discovered that his uncle had died.  I do not accept that there is  any
    satisfactory explanation for not explicitly identifying earlier that he
    had lost contact with his mother (and sisters) in 2009-2010.  I  accept
    Mr Howells' submissions that that case is in a number of respects, as I
    have  identified,  inconsistent   with   what   he   had   said   about
    "occasionally" being in contact with his mother in 2017 and the textual
    context in which he spoke of his family in Iraq in his  statements.   I
    have already dealt with the evidence of Mr  Shepherd  and  I  need  not
    repeat that here.  I accept Mr Howells' submission,  although  this  is
    only a minor matter, that the appellant has in fact a good facility  in
    English.  He communicated with a former Polish partner in  English  and
    he has been to college for four years in the UK and completed a  number
    of courses in English.

69. For these reasons, therefore, I reject the appellant's evidence that he
    has lost contact with his family in Iraq.  I do not accept his evidence
    that his maternal uncle has died.  In his oral evidence, the  appellant
    gave the address of the family home in Kirkuk  City.   I  am  satisfied
    that he remains in contact with them and has the ability to contact his
    mother and maternal uncle, not least as he knows  the  address  of  his
    family home in Kirkuk City.

70. I have made that finding on the basis of all the evidence before me.  I
    have done so without regard, in particular, to Judge Alakija's  partial
    adverse credibility finding made in the appellant's 2009 appeal.   That
    appeal was some time ago and, in a number of  respects,  Judge  Alakija
    accepted what the appellant said.

71. Also, I have not taken into account that Judge Fowell in  fact  made  a
    specific finding  on this issue in para 33 of his  determination  where
    he stated: "I therefore conclude that [the  appellant]  is  in  contact
    with his family in Kirkuk or at least is able to do so."  Judge  Fowell
    accepted that the appellant had a maternal uncle there, as well as  his
    mother.  That finding was not, in fact, challenged in  the  grounds  of
    appeal which led DUTJ Phillips to set  aside  Judge  Fowell's  decision
    and which, in these proceedings, I am remakimg.  He did  not,  however,
    specifically preserve Judge Fowell's finding and, at the hearing before
    me, neither representative referred to  Judge  Fowell's  finding.    It
    could be said that, given that that finding was not challenged,  as  an
    unchallenged finding, it stood.  As I have said, I have not begun  from
    that base position as I was not invited to do so at  the  hearing.   My
    finding, which I have made on the basis of all the evidence before  me,
    is  however  entirely  consistent  with  Judge  Fowell's   unchallenged
    finding.

    The Article 15(c) Claim

72. Mr Frost did not contend that there was a real risk to all civilians in
    Kirkuk City of  serious  harm  arising  from  indiscriminate  violence.
    That, in my judgment, is a correct reflection of the CG decision in SMO
    (see, in particular [425(30)]).  Mr Frost  relied  upon  the  'sliding-
    scale' assessment identified in SMO.

73. In SMO & Others  the  UT  adopted  the  'sliding-scale'  approach  when
    applying Art 15(c) based  upon  the  CJEU's  decisions  in  Elgafaji  v
    Staatssecretaris van Jutsitie (C-465/07) [2009] 2 CMLR 45 at  [39]  and
    Diakite v Commissaire g�n�ral aux r�fugi�s et aux apatrides  (C-285/12)
    [2014] 1 WLR 2477 at [31].  The UT said this (at [32]):


         "At [31] the Court [in Diakite] reaffirmed the view it expressed in
         Elgafaji at [39] that Article 15(c) also contains (what  UNHCR  has
         termed) a "sliding scale" such that "the more the applicant is able
         to show that he is  specifically  affected  by  reason  of  factors
         particular to his personal circumstances, the lower  the  level  of
         indiscriminate  violence  required  for  him  to  be  eligible  for
         subsidiary protection."  The Court thereby recognised that a person
         may still be accorded protection even when  the  general  level  of
         violence is not very high if they are able to show that  there  are
         specific reasons, over and above them  being  mere  civilians,  for
         being affected by the indiscriminate violence.   In  this  way  the
         Article 15(c) inquiry is two-pronged: (a) it asks whether the level
         of violence is so  high  that  there  is  a  general  risk  to  all
         civilians; (b) it asks that even if there is  not  such  a  general
         risk, there  is  a  specific  risk  based  on  the  "sliding-scale"
         notion."


74. The UT went on in [250(32)] to identify the 'sliding-scale'  assessment
    as follows:

         "The situation in the Formerly Contested Areas (the governorates of
         Anbar, Diyala,  Kirkuk,  Ninewah  and  Salah  Al-Din)  is  complex,
         encompassing ethnic, political and humanitarian issues which differ
         by region.  Whether the return of an individual  to  such  an  area
         would be contrary  to  Article  15(c)  requires  a  fact-sensitive,
         'sliding-scale' assessment  to  which  the  following  matters  are
         relevant."

75. At [425(33)] and [425(34)] the UT identified the  relevant  matters  or
    personal characteristics  which  were  to  be  taken  into  account  in
    applying the 'sliding-scale' assessment.  The only one relied  upon  in
    this  appeal  was  the  final  bullet  point  in  [425(34)]  which  was
    "individuals with disabilities".

76. The UT explained the basis for this factor in [312] as follows:

         "The inclusion of category (xvi) - persons with disabilities  -  is
         justifiably premised on a section of the EASO Report which  records
         that  there  is  sadly  discrimination,  inadequate  provision   of
         healthcare and a higher  risk  of  violence,  particularly  against
         those with mental illness".

77. What,  then,  is  my  assessment  of  Art  15(c)  in  this  appellant's
    particular circumstances?

78. Looking at the background material post-SMO relied upon by Mr Frost,  I
    accept  that  there  is  some  evidence  of  an  increased   level   of
    indiscriminate violence in Iraq.  The report of the  Iraq  Humanitarian
    Fund,  "iMMAP  -  Iraq  Humanitarian  Response:  ISIS   Sleeper   Cells
    Activities amid the COVID-19 Pandemic" (at F5-11) noting that:

         "From January to August 2020,  ISIS  caused  292  incidents  taking
         place mainly in Diyala, followed by Anbar,  Kirkuk,  Salah  al-Din,
         Mosul,  Erbil,  and  Baghdad,  which  experienced  fewer  incidents
         compared to other provinces".

79. In addition, Mr Frost relied upon a report by  Charles  Lister,  Senior
    Fellow and Director of MEI Countering Terrorism and Extremist Programme
    (at F30-32) that ISIS armed attacks increased by

         "At least 69% in April 2020 (171 attacks), a marked  increase  that
         comes amid U.S. military withdrawals from remote but  strategically
         key posts in Iraq, the arrival and challenges posed by COVID-19  to
         the region, and continuing political stagnation in Baghdad."

80. That document also notes that:

         "The most dramatic recent escalation in ISIS activity is common  in
         Iraq, where the group has especially increased  attacks  in  Kirkuk
         (by as much as 200%) and Diyala (with near-daily attacks)."

81. The appellant's bundle also contains an article from  the  Middle  East
    Institute, "ISIS's dramatic escalation in Syria and  Iraq"  (May  2020)
    (F30-32) noting an increase by:

         "At least 69 percent in April 2020 (171 attacks), a marked increase
         that  comes  amid  US  military   withdrawals   from   remote   but
         strategically key posts in Iraq, the arrival and  challenges  posed
         by COVID-19 to the region, and continuing political  stagnation  in
         Baghdad".

82. That report also refers to the "increased attacks in Kirkuk (by as much
    as 200%)".

83. I did not understand Mr Frost  to  suggest  that  this  evidence  would
    entitle me to depart from SMO as to the general risk to  civilians  per
    se.  In my judgment, it comes nowhere near  close  to  providing  "very
    strong grounds supported by cogent evidence"  (see  SG  (Iraq)  v  SSHD
    [2012] EWCA Civ 940 at [47]).  I do, however, take it into account when
    assessing the appellant's relevant personal characteristics  which  are
    relied upon and applying the 'sliding-scale' assessment.

84. Mr Frost relied  upon  a  number  of  further  matters,  including  the
    appellant's mental health  and  the  diagnosis  of  moderate  PTSD  and
    moderate depressive disorder from Dr Battersby in her report.  Mr Frost
    submitted,  following  SMO  at  [312],   that   a   relevant   personal
    characteristic in applying the 'sliding-scale' included a  person  with
    "disability".  Further, he relied on the EASO 2019 report  (at  F121  -
    122 of the appellant's bundle) which formed the basis for the UT in SMO
    identifying this as an additional personal characteristic.  Further, Mr
    Frost relied upon the appellant's family circumstances, in  particular,
    his claim that he was not in contact with his mother and that his uncle
    was dead.  He would have,  in  Mr  Frost's  submission,  no  family  in
    Kirkuk.  In addition, and finally, Mr Frost relied upon some background
    evidence post-dating SMO which, he submitted,  showed  an  increase  in
    ISIS-caused incidence nationwide.

85. Mr Frost placed reliance upon a passage in  the  EASO  2019  Report  as
    follows:


         "Persons  with  disabilities  face  a  wide   array   of   societal
         discrimination. The prevailing perception among the  public  is  to
         treat persons with disabilities as  charity.  According  to  UNAMI,
         persons  with  disabilities  'face  common  experiences  of   often
         multiple, intersecting and aggravated forms of discrimination which
         hinder, prevent or impair their full enjoyment of their rights  and
         their full and equal participation in all aspects of society'. This
         often  leads  to  isolation  of  persons  with   disabilities   and
         exacerbates negative psychological  effects.  Adults  and  children
         with disabilities are at  a  higher  risk  of  violence  than  non-
         disabled, and those with mental  illnesses  could  be  particularly
         vulnerable.


         Hospitals  and  other  health  services   in   Iraq   are   heavily
         concentrated in urban areas. Such facilities are either scarcely or
         not at all available for inhabitants of  the  poorer  governorates.
         Both health services and medication are available in a public and a
         private sector system. There is no public health insurance system.


         The lack of materials and specialised staff create difficulties  in
         treating high numbers of patients. In addition,  the  system  lacks
         doctors and medical staff who have reportedly left the country over
         the past years due to the conflict, lack of payment of salaries and
         corruption.


         Following the conflict against ISIL, many civilians and members  of
         the security forces have been left with injuries and  disabilities,
         which require aftercare, prosthetics, and support equipment


         Government and public  health  facilities  that  provide  secondary
         treatments to emergency care, especially those  treating  long-term
         disabilities, have difficulty providing free treatment.


         With regard to mental health, it has been reported that  there  are
         huge needs and the available  services  do  not  meet  the  demand.
         Challenges to the mental health system in Iraq include the lack  of
         funding  and  infrastructure,  limited  number  of  mental   health
         professionals, location of services, as they are often too far away
         for people to travel, as well as stigma.


         Concerning the  access  of  disabled  persons  to  the  educational
         system, USDOS has noted  reports  that  persons  with  disabilities
         experienced discrimination due to social stigma and 'many  children
         with disabilities dropped out of public school due to  insufficient
         physical access to school buildings, a lack of appropriate learning
         materials in schools, and a shortage of teachers qualified to  work
         with children with developmental or intellectual disabilities."

86. Dr Buttan, some 21 months ago, and  Dr  Battersby,  more  recently,  in
    their reports  identify  that  the  appellant  suffers  from  PTSD  and
    depressive disorder.  In her earlier report  Dr  Buttan  described  the
    appellant's PTSD as in the "mild" range and his depressive disorder  as
    "mild/moderate".  Dr Buttan also  noted  that  the  appellant  was  not
    taking any medication or receiving any therapy.  She  recommended  that
    he  be  assessed  by  a  GP  and  receive  appropriate   antidepressant
    medication and CBT.  At the time of Dr Battersby's report in 2020,  the
    diagnosis of PTSD had become "moderate" and the appellant's  depressive
    disorder also had become "moderate".  However, in  the  interim  period
    the appellant was  not  receiving  medication  as  contemplated  by  Dr
    Buttan.  It appears that the appellant did not like the side effects of
    any treatment.  He said that he had been receiving counselling - a  few
    sessions - the last one being on 21 March 2020.  That coincidentally is
    the date of the interview with Dr Battersby and may have been  confused
    by him as being a counselling session.  In any event, the appellant  is
    not receiving therapy and his evidence was that he could not handle  it
    and he was told not to go back.

87. Mr Howells invited me to give less weight to the reports as neither  Dr
    Buttan nor Dr  Battersby  had  considered  whether  the  appellant  was
    feigning or exaggerating his  symptoms  as  required  by  the  Istanbul
    Protocol.  Despite  this  submission,  given  the  experience  of  both
    doctors, in particular Dr Battersby, I do not consider this as a matter
    which both doctors must be taken to have  ignored.   I  therefore  give
    weight to their views, in particular those of Dr Battersby as they  are
    the more current.  In addition to the conditions which Dr Battersby has
    diagnosed, and which I set out above, I note what she says in paragraph
    12 about the risk of the appellant committing suicide in the UK  or  on
    return.  As regards the UK, she concludes that the "risk  of  completed
    suicide ... is moderately low (low end of moderate)".  In  relation  to
    return, Dr Battersby concludes that the risk is 'moderately high  (high
    end of moderate)'.  The highest time of risk would be  if  informed  of
    deportation.  In that case, I would  respectfully  request  that  those
    responsible for his onward care are made aware of my concerns  so  that
    appropriate measures can be put in place."

88. Mr Howells indicated that such measures would be put in place in the UK
    to affect the appellant's removal and I am  satisfied  the  risk  would
    thereby be obviated.   As  regards  the  appellant's  circumstances  in
    Kirkuk, I bear in mind that it has not been established that  he  would
    be at risk on return on the basis that he claimed to  fear  persecution
    in his original claim dismissed by Judge Alakija in 2009.  I also  bear
    in mind that the appellant would return to Kirkuk  City  where  he  has
    family, including his mother, two sisters (although they  are  married)
    and his maternal uncle.  He would, undoubtedly, have family support  in
    Kirkuk to deal both with his emotional needs and also his financial and
    accommodation needs.  I also  bear  in  mind,  and  I  find,  that  the
    appellant has a number of skills and the ability  to  find  employment.
    He accepted, in his evidence before me, that he had aspirations to be a
    doctor or architect prior to Saddam's fall.  Although those aspirations
    may not be realistic now, the appellant accepted that he  was  good  at
    school and that he had done very well  in  this  country  when  he  had
    studied both English and computer skills.   He  has  qualifications  in
    both.  He also has some experience in  the  UK  of  volunteering  in  a
    coffee shop and doing jobs such as painting  and  gardening.   He  also
    accepted that he worked as a carpenter for his  maternal  uncle  before
    leaving Iraq.

89. I accept that  the  appellant  is  suffering  from  moderate  PTSD  and
    moderate depressive disorder but he does not take  any  medication  for
    that in the UK.  The appellant will return to Kirkuk City with a family
    support network and employment opportunities.   Whilst  the  background
    evidence, to which I was referred, demonstrates that the health  system
    in Iraq is not entirely adequate or the equivalent of that in  the  UK,
    particularly including in relation to treatment for mental health, I do
    not consider that the appellant's circumstances will  give  rise  to  a
    real risk in a deterioration in his mental health such  that,  applying
    the lens of Art 15(c), that  personal  characteristic  (taken  together
    with the background evidence to which I have referred) would expose him
    to a real risk of indiscriminate violence despite the evidence of  some
    discrimination against those with mental illness.

90. Taking all these matters into account, including the  implications  (if
    any)  for  the  appellant's  mental  health  on  return,   his   family
    circumstances  in  Kirkuk  City,  I  am  not  satisfied  that  he   has
    established that there is a real risk  of  serious  harm  arising  from
    indiscriminate violence  contrary to Art 15(c) on his return to  Kirkuk
    City.

    The Documentation Issue

91. Mr Frost began his oral submissions  relying  upon  Art  15(b)  of  the
    Qualification Directive and Art 3 of the ECHR.  He submitted  that  the
    appellant would not have the necessary ID documentation  on  return  to
    Iraq and, as was recognised in SMO para (11) of the judicial  headnote,
    without such a document the appellant would not be able  to  travel  or
    live within Iraq without encountering treatment or conditions  contrary
    to Art 3 of the ECHR (and, therefore, contrary  to  Art  15(b)  of  the
    Qualification Directive).

92. It is accepted that the appellant does not  have  a  CSID  in  the  UK.
    There was also no clear evidence before me that allows me  to  conclude
    that the appellant had a CSID in Iraq which could be obtained from  his
    relatives.  The appellant's evidence was that he had an Iraqi  national
    ID card which he had left behind but he was unclear whether this was  a
    CSID.  His evidence was, that as a child, he had not had  a  CSID  only
    his parents would have had had that document.

93. Mr Howells did not pursue in his oral submissions the argument that the
    appellant could obtain an existing CSID from his family in  Iraq.   His
    oral  submissions,  reflecting,  I  think,  para  15  of  his  skeleton
    argument, were that the appellant could ask his family in Iraq to  send
    his national ID card with which  he  could  then  apply  to  the  Iraqi
    Embassy in London for a CSID using that original identity card and  the
    family   book   details   from   his   father's   death    certificate.
    Alternatively,  in  para  16  of  his  skeleton  argument,  Mr  Howells
    submitted that his relatives in Kirkuk could use that ID card  and  the
    family book details in order to obtain a CSID from the  CSA  office  in
    Kirkuk.

94. Mr Howells did not  pursue  those  final  two  arguments  in  his  oral
    submissions because, he accepted, matters, had moved on concerning  the
    obtaining of ID documents since SMO.  He accepted, based upon the  Home
    Office CPIN (June 2020) that the Iraqi Embassy  in  the  UK  would  not
    issue a CSID.   Further, he accepted that the new INID  could  only  be
    obtained in person from the  Kirkuk  CSA  office  if  they  were  still
    issuing such documents.  Mr Howells recognised that, in [430]  of  SMO,
    the UT had concluded that it was likely that the CSA office  in  Kirkuk
    had an INID terminal and  was,  therefore,  no  longer  issuing  CSIDs.
    However, he pointed to the evidence of Dr Fatah, given in June 2019, at
    [369] of SMO that CSIDs could be obtained in Kirkuk.  In  my  judgment,
    Dr  Fatah's  evidence  is  now  out  of  date.   The  evidence  in  the
    appellant's bundle at F1 - F4 clearly indicates that  the  Ministry  of
    Interior has issued "more than 165,000 national  ID  cards  for  Kirkuk
    citizens during the year 2011".  The document, whose contents I accept,
    makes plain that the CSA office in Kirkuk now has an INID terminal  (as
    the UT in SMO at [430] thought likely) and no longer issues CSIDs.  The
    appellant's family could not, therefore, even in possession of  his  ID
    card  and  family  book  details  (which  are  on  his  father's  death
    certificate) obtain a CSID from the Kirkuk CSA office as an INID  could
    only be issued to  the  appellant  in  person  as  it  is  a  biometric
    document.

95. In the light of this, Mr Howells made a submission based upon the  CPIN
    (June 2020) at paras 2.6.15 and 2.6.16 that the appellant could  obtain
    a 'Registration  Document  (1957)'  which  could  then  be  used,  with
    appropriate process, so an INID to be obtained on his return in Kirkuk.
     In addition, Mr Howells submitted  that  the   'Registration  Document
    (1957)' would allow the appellant to  travel safely to Kirkuk  City  in
    order to apply in person for an INID  at  the  local  CSA  office.   He
    pointed out that at [361] of SMO the UT considered that  this  document
    was a civil status document.  He submitted  it  was  unlikely,  if  the
    Iraqi Embassy was issuing such a document as a step to obtaining a CSID
    or INID at a local CSA  office,  that  it  was  intended  to  leave  an
    individual stranded in Baghdad unable to travel because he would be  at
    risk of Art 3 ill-treatment en route.

96. Paragraphs 2.6.15 - 2.6.16 of the CPIN (June 2020) provide as follows:


         "2.6.15  Since  SMO  was  promulgated  in  December  2019   further
         information regarding the issuance of CSIDs  in  the  UK  has  been
         obtained by the Home Office in April 2020 [see Annex I]. When asked
         to describe the process of obtaining a CSID from the Iraqi  Embassy
         in London the Returns Logistics department stated:


         'CSID cards are  being  phased  out  and  replaced  by  INID  (Iraq
         National Identification) cards. It is  not  currently  possible  to
         apply for an INID card outside of Iraq.  As  a  result,  the  Iraqi
         embassy in London are advising their nationals in the UK  to  apply
         instead for a 'Registration Document (1957)' which they can use  to
         apply for other documents such as passports or an  INID  card  once
         they have returned to Iraq.


         'The registration document  (1957)  must  be  applied  for  on  the
         applicant's behalf by a nominated representative in Iraq. In  order
         to start the application, the  individual  requiring  documentation
         would normally provide at least one copy  of  a  national  identity
         document [see  paragraph  2.6.24  for  list  of  national  identity
         documents]  and  complete  a  power  of  attorney  (to  nominate  a
         representative in Iraq) at the Iraqi embassy along with the embassy
         issued application forms.  If  they  have  no  copies  of  identity
         documents they also would need  to  complete  a  British  power  of
         attorney validated by the FCO and provide parents names, place  and
         date of birth to their nominated representative in Iraq.'


         'Once  issued  the   nominated   representative   will   send   the
         registration document (1957)  to  the  applicant  in  the  UK.  The
         process takes 1-2 months.'


         'The HO cannot apply for documentation other than  Laissez  Passers
         on someone's behalf but the embassy is willing to check to  see  if
         the individual  already  holds  documents  and  provide  copies  if
         necessary.'



         2.6.16 Based on the above information, it is highly  unlikely  that
         an individual would be able to obtain a CSID from the Iraqi Embassy
         while in the UK. Instead  a  person  would  need  to  apply  for  a
         registration document (1957) and would then apply for an INID  upon
         return to their local CSA office in Iraq."

97. The argument presented by Mr  Howells  based  upon  paragraphs  2.6.15-
    2.6.16 of the CIPN (June 2020) mirrors those  he  made  in  a  previous
    appeal heard by  (PA/03933/2019).   In  that  appeal,  I  rejected  his
    argument.  It is appropriate that I reproduce  my  reasons  here  which
    were at paras 116-119 of that  earlier  appeal  decision  signed  on  2
    November 2020:

         "116. On the face of it, the  purpose  of  issuing  a  Registration
         Document (1957) is in order to permit an individual to apply for an
         INID on return to Iraq.  Of  course,  that  document  can  only  be
         obtained by an individual attending the relevant CSA Office  (which
         issues such documents) as it is a biometric document.  Mr  Howells,
         however, submitted that possessing a Registration  Document  (1957)
         was the equivalent of possessing a CSID for the  purposes  of  safe
         travel from, for example, Baghdad to an individual's home area.

         117. The evidence from the Iraqi Embassy set out in the  CPIN  does
         not, however, contemplate the document's use in this  way.   It  is
         silent on whether the document would  allow  an  individual's  safe
         passage to their home area.  Mr Howells invited me  to  infer  that
         that was the case otherwise why would the Iraqi Embassy issue  such
         a document.  The answer to that may be that the document is  issued
         in order to allow an individual to obtain an  INID  in  their  home
         area.  That may, for example, be Baghdad itself to where there  may
         be no travel difficulties.

         118. More specifically, however,  the  Iraqi  authorities  are  not
         issuing Registration Documents (1957) in order to  facilitate  safe
         passage to an individual's home area.  The evidence from the  Iraqi
         Embassy is not concerned with  that  issue.   In  my  judgment,  it
         cannot be inferred that is the case on the  basis  of  the  limited
         evidence set out in the CPIN from the Iraqi Embassy.

         119. The UT in SMO  did  not  express  any  view  on  whether  that
         document would allow safe passage in  Iraq.   The  UT  in  SMO  was
         concerned with the relevance of a CSID, an INID, a 'laissez passer'
         or a 'certification letter'.  Neither of the latter  two  documents
         was considered by the UT to allow for such safe passage (see  [374]
         and [378]) and, as [counsel or the appellant] submitted, that  view
         was taken in the face of a (potentially) contrary position taken by
         the Iraqi Embassy itself.  Here, of course, there  is  not  even  a
         view expressed by the Iraqi Embassy. In SMO,  the  UT  referred  to
         with approval the expert evidence that Shi'a militia were  unlikely
         to find acceptable alternative forms of identification to a CSID or
         INID (see [378]).   In  the  light  of  this  evidence,  I  am  not
         satisfied that  even  if  the  appellant  obtained  a  Registration
         Document (1957) - and assuming he has not already obtained  a  CSID
         as I have concluded he could - that document would obviate any risk
         to him, for example at Shi'a militia  checkpoints  on  his  journey
         home to Kirkuk Governance.  The evidence in this appeal simply does
         not make good Mr Howells' submission as to the potential use of the
         document beyond it being a document that allows an individual, once
         in their home area, to obtain an INID."

98. The evidential position is no different in  this  appeal  and  I  adopt
    those reasons here which are, in my  judgment,  equally  applicable  to
    this appellant's  claim  and  justify  the  rejection  of  Mr  Howells'
    submission in this appeal that a 'Registration Document  (1957)'  would
    allow the appellant to safely travel from Baghdad to Kirkuk City  where
    he would then be able to obtain an INID.

99. Consequently, I accept that the appellant would not have a relevant  ID
    document which would allow him safely to travel from Baghdad (to  which
    he would be returned) to Kirkuk City which is his home  area.   As  SMO
    recognised  at  para  (11)  of  the   judicial   headnote,   in   these
    circumstances an individual such as this appellant is at real  risk  of
    serious harm contrary to Art 3 of the ECHR from Shia Militia travelling
    from Baghdad to his home area.  That risk also amounts to a  real  risk
    of serious harm contrary to Art 15(b) of the Qualification Directive.

100. For that reason, the appellant has succeeded in  establishing  that  he
    is entitled to humanitarian protection by virtue of Art 15(b) and  that
    his removal to Iraq would breach Art 3 of the ECHR.

Article 8

101. As I indicated earlier, Mr Frost did  not  raise  Art  8  in  his  oral
    submissions although he briefly referred to Art 8 in paras 47 -  49  of
    his skeleton argument.  Judge Fowell dismissed the  appellant's  appeal
    under Art 8 and that was not challenged in the grounds of  appeal.   It
    was not envisaged as being a live an issue when re-making the  decision
    by DUTJ Phillips in his error of law decision.

102. To the extent that the Art 8 decision turns upon a claim based  on  the
    matters relied upon in the appellant's humanitarian protection and  Art
    3 claims, clearly the appeal should also be allowed under Art 8 on that
    basis.  The appellant's inability to  safely  travel  from  Baghdad  to
    Kirkuk or, if he could, to live in Kirkuk without  documentation  would
    breach Art 8 as much as it amounts to a breach of  Arts  15(b)  of  the
    Qualification Directive and  Art  3  of  the  ECHR.   Having  heard  no
    argument on a wider application of Art 8, it is  on  that  basis  alone
    that I also allow the appeal under Art 8.





Decision

103. The decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  to  dismiss  the  appellant's
    appeal was set aside by DUTJ Phillips' decision dated 5 August 2019.

104. I remake the decision allowing the appellant's appeal  on  humanitarian
    protection grounds under Art 15(b) of the Qualification  Directive  and
    under Arts 3 and 8 of the ECHR.
