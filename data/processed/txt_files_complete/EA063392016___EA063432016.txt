For the Appellant:     Mr C Mupara, counsel.
For the Respondent:    Mr P Nath, Home Office Presenting Officer.


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.    This is an appeal by the appellants against a decision of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal dismissing their appeal against the respondent's decision
    of 5 March 2016 refusing their  applications  for  permanent  residence
    cards as the dependants of an EEA national, exercising treaty rights in
    the UK.

Background

2.    The appellants are citizens of Gambia born on 14  August  1964  and  3
    September 1996 respectively.  They are the wife  and  step-daughter  of
    their sponsor, a Spanish national, who has been residing in the  UK  in
    the exercise of his  treaty  rights  since  October  2008.   The  first
    appellant arrived in the UK on 25 December 2007  and  she  married  the
    sponsor on 1 March 2010.  She was issued with a residence  card  on  28
    September 2010. The second appellant came to the UK as a  dependant  in
    May 2015.

3.    On 19 October 2015 the  appellants  applied  for  permanent  residence
    cards.  In order to qualify they had to  show  that  they  were  family
    members of an EEA national who had resided in the UK with that national
    in accordance with the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations
    2006 ("the 2006 Regulations") for a continuous period  of  five  years.
    In their application they claimed that  the  sponsor  was  a  qualified
    person as he had been in or seeking employment for five years.

4.    The respondent was satisfied from  the  evidence  submitted  that  the
    sponsor was a qualified person in employment for the period April  2010
    to May 2013 and from May 2014 to April 2015.  It was claimed  that  the
    sponsor had been a job seeker for the period August 2013 to April  2014
    but that was  a period exceeding six months  and  the  appellants'  had
    failed to provide any compelling  evidence  of  their  sponsor  seeking
    employment and having a genuine chance of engagement (reg. 6(6) of  the
    2006 Regulations).

The Hearing before the First-Tier Tribunal

5.    At the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal it was argued  that  the
    appellants fell within the transitional provisions in schedule 3 of the
    European Economic Area  (Amendment)  Regulations  2012  but  the  judge
    rejected that argument and there is no appeal against that part of  the
    decision.  The judge accepted that the sponsor had been working as  set
    out in the written evidence from HMRC  and  that  he  had  claimed  job
    seekers allowance (JSA) from 20 May 2013 to 6 May 2014.  She noted that
    he had entered into a jobseeker's agreement on  23  August  2013  which
    identified the jobs he was looking for and what regular steps he  would
    take to identify jobs.

6.    The judge commented that the sponsor was recorded as having been  paid
    �290 in the period from 20 May 2013 to 6 May 2014 (referring to A29  in
    the appellants' documents) but that would only  amount  to  about  four
    weeks' worth of benefit.  She said that she had not been provided  with
    any other evidence that he was looking for work and he had not provided
    a witness statement or other documents to show what  he  was  doing  to
    find work in that period.  She said that, in the absence of  any  other
    evidence that he was looking for work and complying with his agreement,
    she found that the reason that JSA was only paid for a few weeks  in  a
    claim spanning a year was that he had been sanctioned for not complying
    with the Job Centre's requirement to look  for  work  and  to  show  he
    looked for work.

7.    On this basis the judge found that the appellants had not  shown  that
    the sponsor met the first part of condition B in reg. 6(6) of providing
    evidence that he was seeking employment  during  the  relevant  period.
    She accepted that he had started a new job in May 2014 and it  followed
    that he had started to look for work at some point, likely  to  be  put
    towards the end of the period in question, and he had  therefore  shown
    that he had a genuine chance of being engaged because that was what had
    happened at the end of the period when he  was  looking  for  work,  so
    fulfilling the second part of Condition B.  Accordingly, she  dismissed
    the appeal on the basis that it was not shown that the  sponsor  was  a
    qualified person between August 2013 and April 2014 and so far  as  the
    second appellant was concerned, she did not qualify in any  event,  not
    having accrued five years residence in  the  UK  as  required  by  reg.
    15(1)(b).

The Grounds and Submissions

8.    In the grounds of appeal, it is argued that the judge made a  material
    error in that she failed to take account of the evidence at A31 of  the
    appellants documents, a letter dated 21 September 2015 from HMRC to the
    sponsor, which confirmed that the sponsor had received �3,227  JSA  for
    the period starting 20  May  2013.   Mr  Mupara  adopted  the  grounds,
    arguing  that  the  judge  had  erred  in  law  by  proceeding   on   a
    misapprehension of the amount of JSA the sponsor had  received.   There
    had, therefore, so he submitted, been no proper basis for  the  finding
    that the sponsor had been sanctioned for not  complying  with  the  Job
    Centre's requirements.  Mr Nath questioned whether the evidence in  A31
    had been raised before the judge but accepted that, if it had, she  had
    erred by failing to take a relevant matter into account.

The Error of Law

9.    I am satisfied that the judge did  err  in  law  by  proceeding  on  a
    misapprehension of the amount of JSA paid to the sponsor  when  he  was
    out of work.  The amount of JSA received was clearly a  relevant  issue
    and the judge failed to take into account the evidence in the letter of
    21 September 2015 (A31). On  this  basis  she  erred  in  law  and  the
    decision is set aside.  The figure of �290  JSA  was  taken  from  A29,
    whereas in A31 under the sources of income for tax year ended  5  April
    2014, it is recorded that he received �3227 JSA, with a start  date  of
    20 May 2013.  The letter also recorded for tax year ended 5 April  2013
    receipt of JSA of �1704, although that entry is confusing as it shows a
    start date of 20 May 2013 and an end date of 17 March 2013.

Re-making the Decision

10.   Both representatives agreed that if I found an error of law, I  should
    re-make the decision myself and they did not seek to make  any  further
    submissions.  When reaching her findings, the judge  proceeded  on  the
    basis that the appellant had been paid �290 JSA in the period May  2013
    to May 2014.  It is impossible to reconcile the information in A29  and
    A31.  In A31 it is said that the sponsor  received  �3227  JSA  in  the
    period from 20 May 2013 whereas A29 gives a figure of �290.   A29  also
    refers to JSA of �1704 being received from  25  September  2012  to  17
    March 2013 in tax year ending April 2013, A31 giving  the  same  figure
    for that tax year but with dates of 20 May 2013 to 17 March 2013.   The
    date of 20 May 2013 is consistent with the other dates for the start of
    the receipt of JSA but the end date appears to be incorrect and in  A29
    the start date of 25 September 2012 is inconsistent  with  the  sponsor
    being employed until May 2013.

11.   On balance, I am satisfied that the figures in A31 are more likely  to
    be accurate.  I therefore find that the sponsor received JSA  of  �3227
    in tax year ending April  2014.   There  is  no  adequate  evidence  to
    support a  finding  that  the  sponsor  had  been  sanctioned  for  not
    complying with the Job Centre's requirements.  On the  evidence  before
    me I am satisfied  that  sponsor  was  seeking  employment  during  the
    relevant period.  He, therefore, meets both parts  of  Condition  B  in
    reg. 6(6) and it is shown that he was a  qualified  person  during  the
    relevant period of five years.  It follows that the first appellant  is
    entitled to a permanent resident card.  The grounds  do  not  challenge
    the finding that the second appellant did  not  qualify  for  permanent
    residence as she has not accrued five years' residence.

Decision

11.   The First-tier Tribunal erred in law such that the  decision  relating
    to the first appellant should be set aside.  I re-make the decision  by
    allowing the appeal by the first appellant.

12.   No anonymity order was made by the First-tier Tribunal.
