                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr D Brown, of Drummond Miller, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Dinwycz, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals against a determination  by  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Handley, dismissing her appeal against refusal of entry clearance
    as a spouse under Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.

 2. The appellant failed to produce all the  required  documents  with  her
    application.  It is common ground that she tendered  documents  at  the
    hearing  which,  if  produced  to  the  ECO,  would  have  enabled  her
    application to be allowed.  The judge had  some  sympathy  but  thought
    that he could not consider the documents, and so dismissed the appeal.

 3. It was conceded before us that the judge was entitled to  consider  the
    evidence, for the reasons which follow, and that the outcome  therefore
    fell to be reversed.

 4. The combined effect of The Immigration Act 2014  (Commencement  No.  3,
    Transitional and Saving Provisions) Order 2014 (SI 2014/2771)  and  The
    Immigration Act 2014  (Commencement  No.  4,  Transitional  and  Saving
    Provisions and Amendment) Order 2015 (SI 2015/371) is that sections  85
    and 85A, being in part 5 of the 2002  Act,  remain  in  force  in  form
    unamended by the 2014 Act in  relation  to  this  appeal  because  this
    appeal was pending on 6 April 2015.

 5. The introduction of the new subsections (5) and (6) of section 85,  and
    the repeal of section 85A would,  however,  have  made  no  difference,
    because the new evidence is a "matter" within section 85(4) but  not  a
    "new matter" as defined by section 85(6), so the amended section  85(5)
    would not enable its exclusion.

 6. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal  is  set  aside,  and  the
    following decision is substituted: the appeal, as originally brought to
    the First-tier Tribunal, is allowed under the Immigration Rules.

 7. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
