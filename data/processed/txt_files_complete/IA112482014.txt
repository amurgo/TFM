Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr R Claire, instructed by Messrs JM Wilson
For the Respondent:    Mr D Mills, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant, who is from Jamaica, appeals with permission against the
    decision  of  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Lloyd-Smith,  in  a
    determination promulgated on 8th October 2014, to  dismiss  her  appeal
    against refusal to grant to her a  derivative  residence  card  as  the
    primary carer of her children (who are  British)  and  to  dismiss  her
    appeal also under Article 8 ECHR.   The  children  in  question  are  a
    daughter, M, who was born on 30th May 2008 and twin sons,  OR  and  OB,
    born on 19th May 2012.

 2. In the grounds of application (which  now  stands  as  the  Grounds  of
    Appeal) it is said that the judge failed to apply Regulation 15A of the
    2006 EEA Regulations to the older child, M, had failed to have adequate
    regard to the principles in ZH (Tanzania) v SSHD  [2011]  UKSC  4  with
    regard to the best interests of the children, had failed to observe the
    statutory guidance as  to  best  interests  under  Section  55  of  the
    Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 and had  failed  to  take
    account of Section 117B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act
    2002, as amended.  In a response under Rule 24 of  the  Upper  Tribunal
    Procedure Rules it was contended that any error was not material to the
    outcome.

 3. At the commencement of the hearing Mr Mills said that  there  were  two
    elements to the appeal, derivative rights  under  the  Regulations  and
    Article 8 ECHR.  His primary  position  was  that  Article  8  was  not
    justiciable at this stage.  There had been no removal  decision.   That
    was the position taken in the refusal letter  and  he  understood  that
    that was what the Presenting Officer had said at the hearing.   He  was
    however aware of the reported decision in Ahmed  (Amos;  Zambrano;  Reg
    15A(3)(c) 2006 EEA Regs) [2013] UKUT 00089 (IAC).  Mr  Claire  for  his
    part said that the grant of permission had been made  on  all  grounds.
    He submitted that Regulation 15A(4A) was applicable in  respect  of  M,
    whose biological father had no continuing relationship  with  her.   He
    accepted that the regulation was  not  applicable  in  respect  of  the
    twins, whose biological father lived as part of the family unit and was
    himself British.  He said that the Appellant was the primary  carer  in
    respect of the children and that M would be unable  to  remain  if  she
    were required to leave the United Kingdom.  The best interests  of  the
    child were to be with her mother.  Mr Mills interjected at  this  point
    that the best interests of the child were not relevant in this context,
    although they would be in consideration under Article 8.

 4. Mr Claire continued that with regard to Article 8 the judge had  failed
    to consider Section 117B of the 2002 Act. Section 117 had been in force
    at the date of the hearing and the judge erred in failing to  refer  to
    it.  She  had  given  disproportionate  weight   to   the   Appellant's
    immigration history and had confused the best  interest  consideration,
    having weighed it in the context of the evidence as a whole rather than
    first considering the interests of each child.

 5. In response Mr Mills said that the test in Zambrano Case C-34-/9 [2011]
    ECR 1-0000 and Harrison v SSHD [2012] EWCA Civ  1736  was  a  stringent
    one, involving a British citizen being compelled to leave this country.
     It was accepted that the Appellant could not succeed in this regard on
    the basis of the twins.  The  judge  had  found  that  the  Appellant's
    partner was the de facto father of M and there was  no  reason  why  he
    could not care for her.  The principle in Zambrano was not engaged.

 6. With regard to Article 8 the primary position was  that  there  was  no
    reason for the judge to consider that but he accepted  that  there  had
    been no cross-appeal by the Secretary of State on that basis.   Section
    117 of the 2002 Act came into force on 28th  July  2014.   He  accepted
    that the judge had failed to consider in particular Section 117B(6) but
    submitted  that  the  error  was  not  material.    The   question   of
    reasonableness was for the judge and her conclusion was not irrational.
     The children were young and the partner had been born in Jamaica.

 7. He accepted that the best  interests  of  the  children  had  not  been
    considered  as  a  separate  discrete  issue.   Paragraph  20  of   the
    determination could  be  read  in  more  than  one  way  and  could  be
    interpreted as meaning that the best interests of the children were  to
    remain here but then putting that  into  the  context  with  the  other
    evidence.  He submitted that the conclusions reached were rational  and
    open to the judge.  Finally Mr Claire said that there was no  basis  in
    law for the Appellant's current partner to look after M as  he  had  no
    status in that  respect.   He  was  not  her  adoptive  parent  or  her
    guardian.  Mr Mills responded that there was no legal  requirement  for
    guardianship and the case law did not cover the point.

 8. Addressing first the matter of the claimed derivative  right  I  accept
    that the best interests of the children do not come into play  in  this
    regard.  As Mr Mills said the test is a stringent one.  It is  set  out
    with particular clarity in Harrison.  At paragraph 19 of that  judgment
    Lord Justice Elias stated as follows:

         "In my judgment by referring to action which deprives  children  of
         the 'substance of the right' the court is intending to say that the
         right may be infringed if in practice the children will  be  forced
         to leave with their ascendant relative even though  they  could  in
         theory, as a matter of strict law, remain in  the  state  of  which
         they are nationals.  It would be no answer for  the  state  to  say
         that the parents should be denied the right to remain  because  the
         children can be adopted for example.  That approach of the court is
         consistent with the fundamental tenet of EU jurisprudence which  is
         that it always looks at substance rather than form."

    In the current case the judge at first instance dismissed the appeal on
    derivative rights grounds as it appears to have been accepted that  the
    Appellant's current  partner  was  the  "de  facto  father  of  M  ..."
    (paragraph 9).  In the following paragraph the judge  stated  "In  this
    instance, given the fact that Mr Bent is a  British  citizen  he  would
    therefore be in a position to remain with the children if the Appellant
    were forced  to  leave.   Thus  the  Appellant  fails  to  comply  with
    Regulation 15A."  The Appellant's current partner has no blood or legal
    relationship with M.  The judge failed to engage with the issue  as  to
    whether, although the family currently live as a  unit,  in  reality  M
    would be able to continue to live with Mr Bent if the Appellant had  to
    leave or whether she would, in fact, have to  go  with  her  mother  to
    Jamaica.  There is some analogy here to the comments  of  Lord  Justice
    Elias that the prospect of adoption would not be an answer by the state
    to whether the substance of the EU right was affected.  The judge erred
    in this regard and I set aside her decision.

 9. With regard to issues under Article 8 Mr Mills submitted that this  was
    not a matter for the judge to consider but it had been  raised  in  the
    Grounds of Appeal, the judge did consider it, permission to  appeal  to
    this Tribunal was granted on all grounds and there was no  cross-appeal
    by the Secretary of State contending that the matter was not in  issue.
    I appreciate that there are differing views as to whether Article 8  is
    engaged in a residence card case but having  regard  to  all  of  those
    factors and to the only reported decision on the topic, namely Ahmed, I
    do regard the matter as properly before me.

10. Section 117B of the 2002 Act came into force on 28th July 2014.  It was
    not however considered by the judge in her  deliberations.   Subsection
    (6) provides that

         "In the case of a person who  is  not  liable  to  deportation  the
         public interest does not require the person's removal where -

         (a)  the person has a genuine and subsisting parental  relationship
             with a qualifying child, and

         (b)  it would not be reasonable to expect the child  to  leave  the
             United Kingdom."

    That section was  clearly  relevant  to  the  judge's  decision  making
    process and should have been addressed.  It was also the case that  the
    judge failed to make a discrete and  separate  finding  upon  the  best
    interests of the children.  At paragraph 20 of  her  determination  she
    stated "in assessing the best interests of the children  and  the  fact
    that leaving the UK would affect their education and medical  treatment
    I have to weigh that up against the other factors."  That  sentence  is
    not without ambiguity and there is no express clear finding as to  what
    the best interests of the children are.  That  should  have  been  done
    before other factors were put into the balance, the more  so  when  the
    children involved are British citizens; see the comments of  Lady  Hale
    at paragraph 33 of ZH (Tanzania) v SSHD [2011] UKSC 4.  The  judge  was
    aware of that consideration as she referred to the case at paragraph 15
    of her decision but she did not make the finding required as  to  where
    the best interests of the children lay.  I accordingly  set  aside  the
    judge's decision in that respect also.

11. I indicated that I  would  re-decide  the  appeal  as  there  was  time
    available for me to  hear  evidence  and  submissions.   The  documents
    before me consisted of the Respondent's core  bundle,  the  Appellant's
    bundle containing fifteen pages together  with  a  supplemental  bundle
    containing seven pages.

12. The Appellant gave evidence first and adopted her statement.  She  said
    that  she  had  primary  responsibility  for  the  children  and   main
    responsibility for M as her current  partner  was  not  the  biological
    father and did not have parental responsibility.  M needed  her  mother
    to clothe and wash her.  If she had to leave she would not be  prepared
    to leave the children.  Her partner was not in a position to look after
    them.  M's biological father had not been involved with her  since  she
    was 6 months old.  The last time she had seen him was  when  M  was  2�
    years old and that was to get documentation for her  British  passport.
    He had shown no fatherly affection to her.  She had no  idea  where  he
    currently was and he had no interest in M's life.

13. She continued that her partner worked  nights  but  he  would  help  in
    picking M up from school and would see her at the weekends.   He  would
    not be happy to look after M were she to leave.  She called him Dad but
    was aware that he was not her real father.  With regard to  the  twins,
    who had severe medical difficulties due to their premature  birth,  one
    was still having oxygen overnight which she had to  monitor.   She  was
    not sure whether treatment was available in Jamaica but  knew  that  it
    would be at a cost of thousands of dollars.  She was not  sure  whether
    if she had to leave she could leave the twins  with  her  partner.   In
    Jamaica she had maternal uncles, cousins and an aunt.  Her own  parents
    were here, with discretionary leave,  and  her  sister  was  a  British
    citizen.  Her partner worked as a paint sprayer and  earned  just  over
    �16,000 per annum.  She had not worked since 2011; she  had  previously
    worked as a support worker in a care home.  If they went to Jamaica she
    had nowhere to stay and it  would  be  difficult  for  her  with  three
    children.  There was a shortage of jobs.  In Jamaica she had previously
    worked in a wholesale shop and her partner had worked as a farmer.   He
    had some family in Jamaica although  his  parents  were  deceased.   In
    addition to the supply of oxygen at night the twins had numerous  other
    medical  aids  in  connection  with  walking,   occupational   therapy,
    physiotherapy and assistance with vision.  There had been contact  with
    the father of M in August 2014 but he had refused to take care  of  her
    and said it was her responsibility.

14. The Appellant's current partner, Donovan Mark Bent, also gave  evidence
    and adopted his statement.  He said he had a strong relationship with M
    but did  not  have  parental  responsibility  and  he  could  not  give
    permission for matters at school or with regard  to  her  doctor.   The
    children required the Appellant's full attention.  As a man  there  was
    much he could not do for M as she was a young girl.   For  instance  he
    could not bathe her or clothe her  and  she  needed  her  mother.   M's
    father had no contact with her and would not look after her.

15. He continued that M knew that he was not her real father.  He worked at
    nights and would see her in connection with going to school.  Asked why
    he had not adopted her he said he did not  see  himself  able  to  look
    after her as she had the needs of a girl and if the Appellant  left  he
    would not look after her.  He took the twins  to  nursery  and  brought
    them back.  When they woke in the morning  they  would  come  into  the
    parental bed.  However he said that he could not manage  the  twins  on
    his own.  Asked about medical treatment in Jamaica  he  said  that  his
    sister was training as a nurse in Jamaica and she  said  care  for  the
    twins was not possible there.  There was  not  the  equipment  nor  the
    training nor the staff available for physiotherapy, speech and language
    training or development.  The twins  could  not  stand  by  themselves.
    They needed someone with them all the time.  They needed  professionals
    to take care of them.  The family were struggling already  and  if  the
    Appellant had to leave he would not be able to manage.  The twins had a
    very low immune system and their lungs had not developed properly.

16. With regard to his own immigration history he said  that  he  had  come
    here on a marriage visa but he and his wife were separated and  he  had
    not obtained British citizenship until last year although he  had  held
    indefinite leave to remain since 2011.   He  had  no  children  by  his
    former wife.  In Jamaica he had worked as a farmer on a small  plot  at
    his parents' home.  They were deceased and an uncle was now  living  at
    the property.  It was in the country, some  100  miles  from  Kingston,
    where any medical treatment would be.  He particularly did not want  to
    go back to Jamaica because of the violence and the  high  murder  rate.
    He also said that he would not be able to obtain  the  sort  of  highly
    technical job that he was doing in a factory here and he did  not  know
    whether other work was available.

17. In submissions Mr Mills stated that the test was  high  for  derivative
    rights and as M had a British parent prima facie  the  Appellant  would
    not succeed on that basis although circumstances might  show  that  the
    test was met.  He submitted that the requirements were  not  fulfilled.
    There would be substantive disruption but that was  not  sufficient  to
    succeed.  The Appellant's partner had acted as  the  father  of  M  and
    there was no good reason why he could not continue.

18. With regard to Article 8 the Appellant did not meet the requirements of
    the Rules and the best interests were covered under the Rules.  It  was
    very unlikely that she could succeed on that  basis  as  the  partner's
    income was insufficient.  As to the test at  EX.1  that  was  the  same
    question posed as at Section 117B(6)  of  the  2002  Act  and  also  in
    Razgar.  The  Appellant  had  a  poor  immigration  history,  being  an
    overstayer since 2005.  With  regard  to  the  best  interests  of  the
    children he did not seek to say that it was not in their interests  for
    the Appellant to remain but it was reasonable for the family as a whole
    to return.  The partner had only been a British citizen for a year.  He
    accepted that the children were the crux and  he  had  no  evidence  to
    disprove the claim that care would not be available in  Jamaica.   Both
    parents had worked previously.

19. In response Mr Claire said the ultimate question was the  interests  of
    the British children in Jamaica.  The  twins  had  substantial  medical
    needs and were entitled to free medical care in the UK.   If  the  best
    interests of the children were to remain then the best  interests  also
    required the mother to be here.  There had been candid evidence by both
    witnesses.  There might be facilities for medical assistance in Jamaica
    but there would be very substantial obstacles to them  being  accessed.
    With regard to M the Appellant's current partner had  no  legal  status
    with regard to her.

20. The first issue I have  to  decide  relates  to  the  derivative  right
    claimed.  It was accepted that the Appellant  could  not  succeed  with
    regard to her relationship to the twins  as  their  biological  father,
    with parental rights, lives with them.  However inconvenient  it  might
    be for him to have to give up work  in  order  to  care  for  them  and
    however unsatisfactory to their wellbeing it is clear from the case law
    on derivative rights that the crucial  issue  is  whether  the  British
    citizen would be able to remain without the third country national.  It
    was accepted by the representative that this was the case in respect of
    the twins.

21. As for M the situation is different.  She is not the  biological  child
    of the Appellant's partner, Mr Bent.  He has no parental responsibility
    for her, he is not her guardian and he has not adopted her.  He  stated
    in evidence that he would not be able or be prepared to care for her if
    her mother were obliged to return to Jamaica.   He  clearly  felt  most
    uncomfortable about raising a female child who was not  his  own  flesh
    and blood on his own and on the balance of probabilities I find that he
    would  not  do  so.   I  accept  that  the  child  has  no  substantive
    relationship with her real father  who  has  stated  expressly  to  the
    Appellant that the child is her responsibility and  he  will  not  look
    after her.  There was no indication, or suggestion, that other  persons
    in this country could or would look after the child.  The conclusion is
    that she would be obliged to go to Jamaica with the Appellant and would
    thereby lose the reality of her rights as an EU citizen to live  within
    the Union.  As the child would lose  the  substance  of  her  right  to
    remain within the Union if the Appellant had to leave,  the  appeal  on
    the basis of Regulation 15A(4A) of the Regulations succeeds.

22. I turn now to issues arising under Article 8.  The Appellant could  not
    qualify under the parent route of the Immigration Rules as she  and  Mr
    Bent  live  together  and  neither  is  a  single  parent.   She  could
    potentially succeed under the partner  route;  as  an  overstayer  that
    route remains open to her if paragraph EX.1. applies.  However it  does
    appear that Mr Bent would be unable to meet the  finance  requirements,
    earning less than �18,600 per annum.  As Mr Mills acknowledged  EX.1(a)
    is potentially engaged.  There is no doubt that the Appellant is  in  a
    genuine and subsisting parental relationship with M and the  twins  who
    are in the United Kingdom and  are  British  citizens.   The  remaining
    question being under subparagraph (ii) of EX.1 (a) is whether it  would
    not be reasonable to expect the children to leave the  UK.   In  effect
    the same issue arises under Section 117B(6) of the 2002 Act.

23. The children are young but they are in my judgment part of  a  coherent
    family unit.  M has only just started her education.  The twins are  at
    nursery.  However there are very particular considerations applying  to
    the twins as a result of their  medical  condition,  a  consequence  of
    premature birth at 29 weeks gestation.  The Appellant gave evidence  as
    to the care necessary for the twins, in  particular  that  one  had  to
    receive oxygen at night which she had  to  supervise.   She  also  gave
    evidence, which again I accept, of the many  appointments  she  has  to
    attend for them to receive help with various aspects  of  their  lives,
    including walking, seeing and speaking.

24. A letter  in  the  Appellant's  bundle  dated  8th  July  2014  from  a
    consultant paediatrician, Dr Penny Broggio gives details of the medical
    position of the twins, OB and OR.  OR is said to  suffer  from  chronic
    lung disease due to immature lungs and still requires oxygen at  night.
    He requires medication to prevent water logging on  his  lungs  and  is
    closely monitored by a community nursing team.  He  has  suffered  from
    bowel obstruction and has short  gut  syndrome  with  associated  liver
    disease requiring significant input from the gastroenterology and liver
    teams and with that assistance is eating well  and  thriving.   He  had
    bilateral significant intraventricular haemorrhages  and  has  suffered
    some  brain  damage  from  being  born  prematurely  and  has   delayed
    development.  He has regular physiotherapy and has below knee casts  to
    help stretch his Achilles tendons.  He also  required  laser  treatment
    for problems with his eyes as a result of the premature  birth  and  is
    under follow-up scrutiny with the ophthalmology clinic.

25. OB also suffers from chronic lung disease because of immature lungs but
    is no longer taking oxygen.  He too has the  heart  problems  described
    for his brother with brain damage and delayed development as a  result.
    He too receives regular physiotherapy and attends a  child  development
    centre.  He also had the same eye problem requiring laser  therapy  and
    has possible hearing loss.  He also had to have  surgery  on  the  gut.
    The letter concludes that  the  twins  each  have  ongoing  significant
    medical problems requiring input from a number of professionals.   They
    appeared  well  cared  for  and  had  always  been  brought  to   their
    appointments. Advice given  had  been  followed.   The  mother  usually
    brought them and she was at home with  them  when  the  community  team
    called.   They  believed  she  was  providing  good  care.   From   the
    perspective of the neonatal unit and community nursing  there  were  no
    concerns about the care provided by the mother.

26. In his evidence Mr Bent said that there would be real  difficulties  in
    gaining access to appropriate treatment for the twins in Jamaica.   His
    sister, a trainee nurse there, said that she thought the treatment  was
    not available but in any event it would have to be paid for  and  would
    not be available in the country area where the family house was.

27. Not only must I  consider  whether  it  is  reasonable  to  expect  the
    children to accompany the Appellant to Jamaica.  I expressly also  have
    to consider their best  interests  as  a  primary  consideration  under
    Section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act  2009.   The
    recently reported Presidential decision in JO and  Others  (Section  55
    duty) Nigeria [2014] UKUT 00517 (IAC) gives guidance with regard to the
    degree of scrutiny necessary in carrying out this duty.

28. It was abundantly clear from the  medical  letter  and  from  the  oral
    evidence given that the twins require very particular support.  On  the
    evidence that support is unlikely to be available, certainly not to the
    same extent, in Jamaica and in any event would have to be paid for.  On
    the evidence I find it unlikely  that  the  Appellant  would  be  in  a
    position, even with the support of her partner, to be  able  to  afford
    anything like the support which she receives gratis in this country for
    the twins.  They are British citizens and are entitled as of  right  to
    that care.  The position with regard to M  is  less  clear  but  it  is
    apparent that she is doing well  at  school.   She  too  is  a  British
    citizen.  She would receive  education  in  Jamaica  but  her  material
    prosperity is likely to be adversely affected and, should she need  it,
    there would not be free medical care.

29.  I have come to the view that it would  not  be  reasonable  to  expect
    these British children to leave the United Kingdom.  The  Appellant  is
    therefore entitled to succeed under EX.1 and  with  regard  to  Section
    117B(6) of the 2002 Act, to which I must  have  regard  in  considering
    Article 8 issues outside the Rules. Following the Razgar [2004] UKHL 27
    steps, it was not in doubt and was not questioned  that  the  Appellant
    has both family and private life in this country with the other members
    of her family and that obliging her to  leave  would  have  an  adverse
    effect on those rights.  The decision would be in accordance  with  the
    law, in pursuit of legitimate aims, in particular fair  and  consistent
    immigration control, which itself comes within Section 117 of the  2002
    Act.   However  balancing  all  factors,  including   that   need   for
    immigration control, in this particular case to require  the  Appellant
    to leave this country would be disproportionate to the legitimate  aims
    pursued.



Notices of Decision



The original decision contained errors of law  and  I  have  set  aside  the
decisions then made.  I have re-made the decisions and for the  reasons  set
out above the appeal is allowed  under  the  2006  EEA  Regulations  and  on
Article 8 grounds.


There was no request for anonymity and no anonymity order is made.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

I have considered whether to make a fee award in favour  of  the  Appellant.
The appeal only succeeded as a result of the oral evidence given  before  me
which I have described above.  In those circumstances I do not make any  fee
award.
