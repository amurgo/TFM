                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant in these proceedings is the Secretary of State.  However,
    for convenience I shall now refer to the parties as  they  were  before
    the First Tier Tribunal.

2.   The Appellant is a Citizen  of  Nepal  born  on  14  March  1984.   She
    applied for leave to remain in the United Kingdom as a Tier 4 (General)
    Student Migrant.  Her application was refused by the Respondent  on  22
    July 2013.  Her appeal was heard by Judge of the  First  Tier  Tribunal
    Boyd on 13 May 2014.  He allowed the appeal under the Immigration Rules
    in a Determination promulgated on 23 May 2014.

3.   An application for permission to appeal was made by the  Respondent  on
    13 June 2014.  The grounds of application state that the Judge erred in
    his approach to Section 85A of the Nationality,  Immigration  &  Asylum
    Act 2002 as he admitted evidence he ought to have excluded.  The  Judge
    found that by the date of the Hearing the Appellant had  submitted  the
    correct financial evidence but that evidence was not submitted with her
    application  and  that  is  necessary  according  to  the  Rules.   The
    permission states that the Judge may have erred in allowing the  appeal
    by relying on evidence that ought not to have been included.

The Hearing

4.   Mr Dillon is a friend of the Appellant who appeared at the  First  Tier
    Hearing and made submissions to the Judge.

5.   The Presenting Officer made her  submissions  submitting  that  she  is
    relying  on  the  grounds  of  application  and  the  permission.   She
    submitted that the Judge relied on information which  should  not  have
    been relied on and Section 85A prohibits the Judge from doing this.

6.   I was referred to paragraph 9 of the Determination which states  "I  am
    satisfied from all the bank accounts now produced, that  the  Appellant
    has in excess of the required ï¿½1,600 for a  consecutive  period  of  28
    days falling within the 31 days prior to the date  of  the  application
    and indeed she had the required funds in her account from 3 April  2013
    right up until the date of the application on 28 June 2013, a period of
    87 days".

7.   I was asked to find that there is  a  material  error  of  law  in  the
    Judge`s Determination.

8.   I asked Mr Dillon if all the bank statements were  submitted  with  the
    application.  He referred me to a letter which is on file which  states
    that the Appellant originally went to a person who was falsely  passing
    himself off as a solicitor and legal immigration advisor. He said  that
    this was confirmed by the Solicitors  Regulations  Authority.   A  cash
    payment was made to that person and although he submitted the  relevant
    application form he did  not  complete  it  properly  and  he  sent  no
    evidence with it.

9.   I asked him if the relevant  bank  statements  were  put  in  with  the
    application form.  Mr Dillon said they were  not.   He  said  the  bank
    statement originally submitted was 3  days  out.    The  original  bank
    statement was from 25 May 2014 until 21 June 2014.  He  submitted  that
    the matter was dealt with on 28 June 2014 and the bank statement was  3
    days short of the required term.  I asked him  when  the  correct  bank
    statement was submitted and he said that was in April 2014.

10.  Mr Dillon informed me that he had had  many  conversations  with  a  Ms
    Mercer of the Home Office who told him to put all the documents  in  as
    soon as possible and when the first Hearing went ahead, Mr Liddle,  the
    Presenting Officer, assured him that everything would  be  alright  and
    Judge Boyd allowed the appeal.

11.  It is clear  that  Mr  Dillon  and  the  Appellant  were  misled.   The
    permission in this case was granted because of  a  technicality,  under
    Section 85A of the Nationality, Immigration & Asylum Act  2001.   Judge
    Boyd should not have accepted the evidence which was produced after the
    date of application.  There  is  therefore  an  error  of  law  in  his
    Determination.  Section 85A(4) states that where  exception  2  applies
    the Tribunal may consider evidence produced by the Appellant only if it
    (a) was submitted  in  support  of  and  at  the  time  of  making  the
    application to which the immigration decision related.  That is not the
    case here.

12.  The First Tier Judge relied on evidence  which  should  not  have  been
    relied on because it was not submitted with the application  and  there
    is therefore an error of law in his Determination.

Decision

13.  I  find  that  there  is  a  material  error  of  law  in  the  Judge`s
    Determination under the Immigration Rules.

14.  I set aside the First-tier Tribunal's decision.

15.  The claim under the Immigration Rules is dismissed.

16.  No Anonymity direction has been made
