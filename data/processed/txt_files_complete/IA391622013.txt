                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the Appellant's appeal against the decision  of  Judge  Brunnen
    made following a hearing at Manchester on 23rd June 2014.

Background

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of the Philippines  born  on  25th  December
    1970.  She came to the UK with leave to  remain  which  expired  on  18
    August 2012. On 9th August 2012 she applied for leave to remain in  the
    UK as a domestic servant.  The application was submitted  by  her  then
    representatives, JMS  Immigration  Consultants  and  accompanied  by  a
    cheque for the fee of ï¿½561 drawn on her former employer's joint account
    at Lloyds TSB.  The Appellant stated, and the judge accepted, that  she
    had agreed with her then employers that the fee should be deducted from
    her wages.

 3. The Respondent acknowledged receipt of the application on  20th  August
    2012 but rejected it as invalid for non-payment of a  required  fee  on
    8th October 2012.  The Respondent said that:

         "Although a cheque has been submitted there were insufficient funds
         in the account and the bank has returned the cheque unpaid."

 4. The Appellant made a fresh application on 15th October 2012  which  was
    refused on 19th March  2013  on  the  grounds  that,  at  the  date  of
    application, the Appellant did not have current leave to remain and  so
    could not satisfy paragraph 159AE(vi) of the Immigration  Rules,  which
    requires that the Appellant should not  be  in  the  UK  in  breach  of
    immigration law.  It was  against  that  decision  that  the  Appellant
    appealed to Judge Brunnen.

 5. It was agreed between the parties that if the judge were to  find  that
    the application made on 9th August 2012  was  not  fairly  and  validly
    rejected then the decision of 19th March 2013  was  not  in  accordance
    with the law.  If it was validly rejected, then the application of 15th
    October 2012 did not result in an appealable immigration decision since
    the decision did not result in the Appellant having no leave to remain,
    it having already expired when the application of 15th October 2012 was
    made.

The Appellant's Employment History

 6. The Appellant began to work for Mr and Mrs G on 28th June  2012.   They
    lived mainly in the Czech Republic and  they  returned  there  on  24th
    August 2012.  The Appellant completed her domestic duties with them  on
    30th August and on 3rd September began to work for  someone  else.   It
    appears that Mrs G told the Appellant that she wanted her to  work  for
    the family again when they returned to the UK for four weeks from  18th
    October 2012 but the Appellant told  her  that  she  could  not  comply
    because she had obtained permanent employment.  Mrs  G  threatened  her
    with withdrawal of sponsorship from the Appellant's application.

 7. The Appellant has produced substantial evidence that she has  been  the
    victim of trafficking  and  she  has  been  accepted  as  such  by  the
    competent authority.

The issue before the Judge

 8. The Appellant relied on the case of Basnet (validity of  application  -
    Respondent) [2012] UKUT 00113 which held that if the Respondent asserts
    that an application was not accompanied by a fee and therefore invalid,
    the Respondent bears the burden of proof.  In that  case  the  fee  was
    paid by credit/debit card.

 9. The Tribunal held that:

         "Validity of the application is determined not by whether  the  fee
         is actually received but by whether the application is  accompanied
         by a valid authorisation to obtain the entire fee that is available
         in the relevant bank account."

10. The Tribunal did not consider  that  the  evidential  burden  had  been
    discharged by the Respondent of demonstrating that the application  was
    not accompanied by the authorisation enabling the Respondent to receive
    the fee in question.  The Secretary of State was unable to produce  the
    billing data page, and the applicant was deprived of an opportunity  of
    checking the accuracy of the  billing  data,  and  was  not  given  any
    evidence-based specific reason why the processing had failed. In  these
    circumstances he ought to have been given an opportunity  to  re-submit
    the application before the leave expired.

11. The judge distinguished Basnet on the grounds that  in  that  case  the
    Appellant had proved that there were sufficient funds in his account at
    the material time which was crucial to the decision.  He said that  the
    difficulty in Basnet was proving whether the accurate billing data  had
    been provided by the applicant in circumstances where the only evidence
    of that data had passed into the hands of the Respondent.

12. The judge wrote as follows:

         "The situation  where  payment  is  tendered  by  cheque  is  quite
         different.   It  does  not  depend  on  the   applicant   providing
         absolutely accurate data  to  the  Respondent.   The  name  of  the
         account, the cheque number, the account number and  the  sort  code
         are printed on the cheque.  The other details have to be  completed
         by the drawer but there is not the same scope for a factual slip as
         where data for a card transaction is supplied.  In the present case
         we have a copy of  the  cheque  in  the  Appellant's  supplementary
         bundle.  The payee, the amount in words and figures  and  the  date
         are all correct.  It is  signed  with  a  signature  that  bears  a
         distinct  resemblance  to  Mr  G's  signature  on  the  application
         documents.   Payment  by  cheque  does  not  then  depend  on   the
         Respondent processing data with complete accuracy.  A cheque  is  a
         physical object which the Respondent sends for clearing.  There  is
         not the same scope for undetectable error.  It is not  a  situation
         in which it is impossible for the applicant to find  out  what  has
         gone wrong because the data he supplied has been destroyed  and  he
         has  no  means  of  knowing  whether  he   inadvertently   supplied
         inaccurate  data   or   whether   the   Respondent   processed   it
         inaccurately.  The person on whose account the cheque is drawn  can
         verify whether there were or  were  not  sufficient  funds  in  the
         account to cover the cheque and if the  cheque  has  been  returned
         unpaid, he will have been informed of this by the bank and have the
         opportunity to make appropriate enquiries if  he  believes  that  a
         clerical error has occurred."

13. The judge concluded that in the present case there was no evidence that
    there were sufficient funds in the account to cover the cheque and,  on
    the contrary, the available evidence was that the sums in that  account
    were insufficient.  He was not prepared to infer that there would  have
    been sufficient funds in the Lloyds TSB account simply  from  the  fact
    that Mr G had money at his disposal.  In the absence  of  any  evidence
    that there were sufficient funds in the account,  which  the  Appellant
    had not established, he concluded that it was more  probable  than  not
    that there were insufficient funds.

14. He recorded that Ms Warren's alternative submission  was  that  if  the
    cheque drawn on the account was returned unpaid it was unfair  for  the
    Respondent to reject the application without giving  the  Appellant  an
    opportunity  to  remedy  the  situation.   The  judge  said  that   the
    Respondent could not reasonably  be  expected  whenever  a  cheque  was
    returned unpaid to refer back to  an  applicant  before  rejecting  the
    application as invalid.  No distinction could properly be made  whether
    the cheque was drawn on the  applicant's  own  account  or  on  another
    account.  There was no analogy with the revocation of a  licence  of  a
    student's college  because  it  was  not  due  to  any  action  by  the
    Respondent that the cheque was returned unmade.

15. On that basis he dismissed the appeal for want of jurisdiction.

The Grounds of Application

16. The Appellant sought permission to appeal on the grounds that  fairness
    would dictate that, due to her  vulnerability  as  a  foreign  domestic
    worker, when it became clear to the Respondent that the only reason her
    application was refused was due to the actions  of  her  employers  (by
    having insufficient funds in their account to pay the fee)  she  should
    have been given an opportunity to re-submit the application  before  it
    was rejected as invalid.  She relied on the case of EK (Article 4 ECHR:
    Anti-Trafficking  Convention)  Tanzania   [2013]   UKUT   00313   which
    recognised that particular measures  were  needed  to  protect  foreign
    domestic workers who  had  been  trafficked  and  exploited  by  forced
    labour.

17. She also relied on Patel  (revocation  of  licence  -  fairness)  India
    [2011] UKUT 00211 which held:

         "Where the applicant is both innocent of any practice that  led  to
         loss of the sponsorship status and ignorant of  the  fact  of  such
         loss of status it seems to us that  common  law  fairness  and  the
         principle of treating applicants equally mean that each should have
         an equal opportunity to vary their application by affording them  a
         reasonable time with which to find a substitute college on which to
         base their application for an  extension  of  stay  to  obtain  the
         relevant qualification.  In  the  curtailment  cases  express  Home
         Office policy is to afford 60 days for such application to be made.



         Although we accept that there is no such policy for  refusal  cases
         fairness requires that such cases be treated in  broadly  the  same
         way.  The applicant must  be  given  an  equal  opportunity  before
         refusal of application to amend it in the way  we  have  described.
         This was clearly not done in this case.  The Home Office knew  that
         it had suspended the college in January 2010 but no one  else  did.
         The applicant could not have known that subsequently the  college's
         status as an approved Sponsor was revoked  before  his  application
         for an extension of stay was decided."

18. This was analogous to the Appellant's position because she was ignorant
    of any practice by her employers which led  to  her  application  being
    treated as invalid.

19. Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge  Kopieczek  on
    18th November 2014.

Submissions

20. Ms Warren relied on her grounds and submitted that the  judge  had  not
    engaged with her submissions. Where  the  alleged  non-validity  of  an
    application stems from a third party's actions, fairness  requires  the
    applicant to be given a chance to correct it, particularly so where the
    application is from a domestic worker. The Respondent should have  been
    alert to the potential for unfairness because the cheque was  drawn  on
    the employer's account.  The Appellant could  not  have  known  of  the
    circumstances relating  to  the  non-payment  of  the  cheque  and  the
    Respondent's  common  law  duty  of  fairness  required  her  in  these
    circumstances to go back to the Appellant because domestic workers  are
    specifically recognised as a particularly vulnerable group. States  are
    obliged to prevent and combat trafficking in persons  and  the  UK  has
    implemented a  number  of  measures  to  comply  with  its  prevention,
    deterrence and punishment obligations.

21. Second, she submitted that the Respondent had  acted  unfairly  in  not
    acting promptly on the application, thereby giving the  opportunity  to
    the employer to ensure that the funds in the bank account would not  be
    available.  The application was  made  on  15th  August  2012  but  not
    rejected until 8th October 2012. She relied on the case of Patel  cited
    in the grounds and submitted that the decision was  not  in  accordance
    with the law because the Respondent had not given  the  opportunity  to
    the Appellant to rectify the situation which was not of her making  and
    which was not known to her.

22. Mr Diwnycz submitted that there was no unfairness in  the  Respondent's
    procedures.  There was no room for accidental error in this  situation.
    If the Appellant submitted a cheque, the onus lies with her  to  ensure
    that the funds were available. The  fact  that  the  employer's  cheque
    bounced did not absolve the Appellant from  her  responsibilities.  She
    could have chosen an alternative method of payment.   Seven  weeks  was
    not a lengthy delay.  The cheque could have been presented at any  time
    before 8th October when the decision letter was written.

Findings and Conclusions

23. This issue has recently been considered by the Court of  Appeal  in  EK
    (Ivory Coast) v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 1517.  The Court  of  Appeal  held
    that the distinguishing factor between cases which could succeed on the
    basis of unfairness and those which could not was whether the Secretary
    of State bore any responsibility for the  errors  which  had  occurred.
    The so-called student fairness cases all  depended  upon  a  change  of
    position of which the Secretary of State was aware.  The  students  had
    been caught out by actions taken by the Secretary of State and  had  no
    opportunity to protect themselves.

24. In the cases where it had been concluded that there had been unfairness
    the Home Office bore substantial responsibility for  the  errors  which
    had occurred.

25. Lord Justice Sales  said:

      i) "In the present case by contrast the  Secretary  of  State  had  no
         means of knowing why the Appellant's CAS letter had been  withdrawn
         and was not responsible for its withdrawal  and  the  fair  balance
         between the public interest in the due operation of the PBS  regime
         and the individual interest of  the  Appellant  was  in  favour  of
         simple operation of the regime without further ado."

26. Lord Justice Floyd, in the minority made the same point and said:

         "Where is the line to be drawn in these classes  of  case?   To  my
         mind the principle must  be  that  where  the  Secretary  of  State
         becomes aware of a material  change  of  circumstances,  since  the
         application  was  filed  which  would  have  the  effect  that  the
         application must be refused then  (unless  it  is  clear  that  the
         applicant has been made aware of the  change  of  circumstances  or
         that the change of circumstances was the fault of the applicant  or
         that the defect  is  obviously  irredeemable)  she  must  give  the
         applicant an opportunity of dealing with the changed  circumstance.
         Such principle in my judgment strikes the right balance between the
         need for the PBS system to work efficiently  and  for  it  to  work
         fairly."

27. In this case plainly the Respondent could bear no  such  responsibility
    which rested, on the facts as found by the judge, entirely with Mr  and
    Mrs G.  Neither did she have any means of knowing why  the  funds  were
    not available in the account.

28. The delay of seven weeks is not an unreasonable one but  in  any  event
    the Secretary of State could not possibly have known that Mr and Mrs  G
    intended to, on the Appellant's  evidence,  maliciously  undermine  the
    application and indeed defraud her because she had  already  paid  them
    the fee through her wages.

29. So far  as  Basnet  is  concerned,  the  judge  was  plainly  right  to
    distinguish it.  In Basnet the Appellant could  show  that  there  were
    sufficient funds in his account and was able to  demonstrate  that  the
    application was accompanied by authorisation to obtain the  entire  fee
    which was available in the relevant bank account.   In  this  case  the
    judge  found  on  the  balance  of  probabilities   that   there   were
    insufficient funds in the account to cover the cheque.

30. Ms Warren's said that the duty does not arise in all cases but only  in
    cases where there is particular vulnerability, and  where  the  UK  has
    specific obligations  such  as  in  the  prevention  and  combating  of
    trafficking  in  persons.   It  is  difficult  to  see  how  the   UK's
    obligations under Article 4 of the ECHR or Article 2A  of  the  Palermo
    Protocol require them to alert an applicant, applying  for  a  domestic
    service visa, that there were insufficient funds in the account to  pay
    the cheque. Whilst  the  UK  has  obligations  to  prevent  and  combat
    trafficking it is difficult to see why those obligations should  extend
    to giving notice of insufficient  funds  in  an  account.    Ms  Warren
    submitted that the fact that the cheque was  drawn  on  the  employer's
    account should have alerted the Secretary of  State  to  the  potential
    problem, but the employer was sponsoring the application and there  was
    no reason at all to believe that Mr and Mrs G would have acted as  they
    did.

31. It cannot be said that  the  Respondent's  decision  is  unlawful,  and
    accordingly no error in the judge's decision.

Decision

32. The original judge did not err in law and  the  decision  stands.   The
    Appellant's appeal is dismissed.

No anonymity direction is made.
