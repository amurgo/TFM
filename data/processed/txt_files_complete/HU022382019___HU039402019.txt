                            DECISION AND REASONS

    Introduction

    1. The appellants are citizens of Sri Lanka, and are a  married  couple
       with a baby, AK, born in June 2018. The first appellant  arrived  in
       the UK on 31st May 2008 as a student, and was granted leave in  that
       capacity until 18th October 2013.  On 27th September 2013 the  first
       appellant applied for an extension of leave  as  a  Tier  1  migrant
       which was granted on 18th October 2013 until 10th October  2016.  He
       applied to extend this leave, and then varied  this  application  on
       31st May 2018 to an application for indefinite leave to remain. This
       application was refused in a decision dated 22nd February 2019.  The
       second appellant made a human rights  application  on  10th  October
       2016, and this was refused in a decision dated 18th  February  2019.
       Their appeals against these decisions were dismissed  by  First-tier
       Tribunal Judge NMK Lawrence in a determination  promulgated  on  the
       31st May 2019. Permission to appeal was granted  by  Upper  Tribunal
       Judge Mandalia and I found that the First-tier Tribunal had erred in
       law for the reasons set out in  my  decision  at  Annex  A  to  this
       decision, and set aside the decision and all of the findings of  the
       First-tier Tribunal.

    2. The matter comes before me now to remake the appeal. The hearing was
       held remotely, by Skype for Business, in light of the need to reduce
       the transmission of the Covid-19 virus and in light  of  this  being
       found to be acceptable by both parties and being a  means  by  which
       the appeal could be fairly and justly determined.  There  were  some
       issues of connectivity, particularly with the video element and some
       issues with audibility during the hearing, but  when  this  happened
       the hearing was stopped and I checked with the parties that  nothing
       had been missed and recapped so as to ensure that continuity of  the
       proceedings was maintained. The judges' computer  screen  failed  to
       connect so I conducted the hearing from the court  clerk's  computer
       screen.

    3. It was agreed that there were three  issues  on  which  the  hearing
       needed to focus: firstly, whether the first appellant had  submitted
       dishonest information to the Home Office in August 2013 or dishonest
       information to HMRC in his April 2013/ April 2014 tax return made in
       January 2015. Secondly, whether it was  undesirable  for  the  first
       appellant to be allowed to remain in the UK as a result of any  such
       conduct, and thus whether his application under  paragraph  276B  of
       the Immigration Rules fell to be refused under paragraph  322(5)  of
       the Immigration Rules. Thirdly, whether  the  refusal  of  leave  to
       remain was a disproportionate interference with the appellants'  and
       their baby daughter's right to respect for private life as protected
       by Article 8 ECHR.

Evidence & Submissions - Remaking

    4. The first appellant confirmed his name and  address  and  gave  oral
       evidence in English to the Upper Tribunal.  He  confirmed  that  his
       four statements were true and correct and  signed  by  him.  He  was
       cross-examined at length by Mr Melvin for the respondent.

    5. The key evidence of the first appellant with respect to his earnings
       in the tax  period  April  2013  to  April  2014,  and  the  claimed
       inaccuracy in his initial tax return to HMRC for this period  is  as
       follows.  The appellant explains that he only had to amend this  one
       tax return, for the tax period ending in April 2014, and he  did  so
       voluntarily, and said it would be unlikely that he would  have  done
       this dishonestly given he had paid over �37,000 in tax whilst in the
       UK and the amount underpaid was under  �6000  in  tax  and  national
       insurance contributions. The error related to his self-employed work
       for his business  BKE  IT  Solution.  His  former  solicitors,  Jein
       Solicitors, who helped him  with  his  indefinite  leave  to  remain
       application made in 2016 told him about the error. He  had  no  idea
       that it had taken place until they informed him.

    6. When the first appellant made his April 2014 tax return  in  January
       2015 he had been under emotional stress as his new wife, the  second
       appellant, had just come to the UK in November 2014 and  was  having
       difficulties adjusting to life in  this  country.  He  provided  his
       accountant with his bank  statements,  invoices  and  expenses,  but
       late, in January 2015, due to his marriage and being  distracted  by
       the issues his wife was  dealing  with.   His  accountant  was  also
       having some problems and due to the short time-frame for lodging the
       tax return on time (it was  submitted  on  28th  January  2015)  the
       accountant just checked the figures with him on the  telephone.  The
       accountant provided him with no paperwork for  this  particular  tax
       return, even after it was submitted, although he would normally have
       done this.

    7. The error in the April  2014  tax  return  came  about  because  his
       accountant, TS Accountancy, made a mistake and confused his expenses
       figures with those belonging to another client of theirs who had his
       first name as a surname. This led TS Accountancy to  deduct  �15,000
       of expenses rather than �1000 of expenses from the gross  income  of
       his business. As a result of this being their error  TS  Accountancy
       paid for the service in amending the tax  return  and  the  interest
       owing to HMRC for the late payment. The first appellant did not spot
       the error made because he is not an accountant,  he  is  a  software
       engineer, and because he relied upon his  accountancy  professionals
       he had employed to get it right. He did initially pay �4416 in  tax,
       and it did not occur to him that this was not correct.    The  first
       appellant was not able to use TS Accountancy  for  his  Home  Office
       application made in August 2013 as they were not able to take on the
       work at that time, but he has used them at all other times  as  they
       are his preferred accountancy firm.

    8. The reason the first  appellant  worked  hard  to  earn  more  self-
       employed money in this period, and at other periods when he  had  to
       make applications to the respondent for leave to  remain  (2010/2011
       and 2016/2017), compared to other times,  was  because  he  knew  he
       needed to earn enough to meet  the  threshold  for  the  immigration
       applications. As he also got married in September 2014 this explains
       why he did not have much money in his bank account as he also had  a
       lot of expenses at that time. He did not do  half  of  his  work  in
       August 2013 as contended by the Home Office in their submissions, as
       he billed in August 2013 for some of the work he had done earlier in
       that tax year.

    9. The first appellant explained that he likes his team job with KFC so
       would not choose to give it up even if his  self-employed  work  was
       going well and he was earning  a  lot  of  money,  and  further  his
       employed KFC job gives him perks such as holiday pay, sick pay and a
       pension and allows him more family time which is important given  he
       has had some very emotional stuff going on in his personal life.  He
       therefore does less self-employed work if it is not needed  for  his
       immigration applications; if there is less demand; and if  he  wants
       to spend more time with  his  family.  It  is  also  his  view  that
       although sometimes self-employment brings in a lot of  money  it  is
       not such a reliable consistent source of income.

   10. The first appellant explained that he obtains his self-employed work
       through personal  recommendation  and  word  of  mouth  through  his
       community contacts, and does not use advertising or  a  website.  He
       has done his work, installing electronic tills, CCTV and setting  up
       and repairing computers mostly for small convenience stores and off-
       licences run by members of his ethnic community, and he believes  he
       is chosen because he can provide a cheap service.  He  did  not  buy
       the hardware but let the clients do this as  they  were  mostly  VAT
       registered so it is cheaper for them to do this than for him, as  he
       is not VAT registered.  When  references  are  made  to  cabling  on
       invoices this is the work done to cable not the cost of the physical
       cables. He did not claim depreciation on his tools with HMRC as they
       remained  in  good  condition,  and  he  used  public  transport  or
       transport laid on by his clients to do his work. His claimed  travel
       costs of �784 for 2013/2014 are accurate, despite some of  the  work
       being at a distance from his home in Luton  (for  instance  jobs  in
       Wales). He had had public liability insurance in 2011  but  did  not
       renew it to save costs (even  though  this  was  only  around  �100)
       although he now accepts he should have renewed it, but at  the  time
       he did not think it necessary as he could not see that his work  was
       risky in this way. He was not accredited by  potential  associations
       for persons doing this type of work because he was offering a  cheap
       service that clients could trust. His clients would not have  chosen
       him due to his having accreditations, and further for  the  type  of
       work he did it was not compulsory to be regulated or accredited.  He
       denied the contention put to him that the invoices were  fabricated,
       and gave evidence that he had done all of this work. He had invoiced
       some of his customers with a two-year warranty and offered to  check
       the tills/CCTV after six months  but  if  the  equipment  was  still
       working with no problems then he had not always done these checks as
       there  was  no  point.  His  training  and  testing  charges  varied
       depending on the job specification and wishes of  the  customer.  He
       explained that he kept up to date via internet research and was able
       to do the work due to his degree in information technology (software
       engineering) which he had started  in  Sri  Lanka  and  finished  at
       Sheffield Hallam University. He had not done any further courses  or
       studies in the UK as this was not needed.

   11. The key evidence of the first appellant with  respect  to  his  more
       general private life application to remain is that firstly  that  he
       wishes to be here so that he can continue to visit the grave of  his
       son who was stillborn on 23rd  February  2017.  He  and  the  second
       appellant do  this  regularly  and  find  some  comfort  from  this.
       Secondly, the first appellant argues that they need to be allowed to
       remain in the UK as this is in the best interests of their daughter,
       AK, born on 10th June 2018, who has global developmental delay,  and
       is reliant on a feeding tube and a team of some 18 professionals  in
       the UK. He says that  this  team  of  expert  UK  professionals  are
       struggling to understand her rare genetic condition in  the  UK  and
       her care could not be replicated in  Sri  Lanka.  He  accepted  that
       neither he nor the UK professionals have made  any  enquiries  about
       whether it would be possible to access this package of care for  his
       daughter in Sri Lanka, but he just does  not  believe  it  would  be
       possible given that experts here were struggling.   In addition, the
       first appellant wishes to remain in the UK so  he  can  continue  to
       contribute to the UK by running his own business  BKE  IT  Solution,
       which he has now run for ten years, and to do his work as a  trainee
       manager for KFC.

   12. The evidence from TS Accountancy consists of three letters  from  Mr
       Subeasharan Kulasegaram, together with a statement  of  truth  dated
       7th December 2020 which he adopted before me. The letters dated 19th
       September 2016 and 23rd September 2016  concerning  the  appellant's
       income from self-employment during the  period  September  2015  and
       September 2016, which the respondent did not pursue as an  issue  in
       this appeal. The letter dated 14th September 2016 concerning the tax
       return made in April 2014 which was said to  be  inaccurate  because
       mistakenly expenses of �13,655 were claimed rather than �1027 due to
       an "error in our  side",  meaning  when  corrected  that  the  first
       appellant had to pay an additional �5729.07 in  tax,  and  that  his
       gross profit was �29,545 for that tax year.

   13. In oral evidence,  adduced  in  response  to  cross-examination,  Mr
       Kulasegaram explained that he had taken over TS Accountancy in  late
       November 2014 and at the same time he had had to deal with a problem
       with a leak in the ceiling of his office  (which  meant  a  move  in
       premises) and the fact that his wife had cancer  and  he  was  going
       with her to hospital (she sadly passed way in 2018),  and  the  fact
       that a lot of tax returns  were  needing  to  be  completed  by  the
       deadline of the end of January 2015. As a result he had only checked
       the appellant's figures with him on the telephone and  provided  him
       with  no  correspondence.  This  would  not  have  been  his  normal
       practice, but circumstances had led to him not doing things properly
       at that time. Fortunately, there had been no other mistakes for  any
       other clients, but with the appellant he had mixed up  his  expenses
       with those of another client also called  Kirubakaran.  He  did  not
       know he had made this mistake until it was drawn to his attention in
       2016, when he corrected it with a revised tax return. When he  found
       out he self- reported his error to his professional body, the IFA in
       September 2016, and also told them that he had filed a corrected tax
       return to address the error. He has not heard anything from the  IFA
       since that time.

   14. The medical evidence regarding the appellant's daughter, AK, born on
       10th June 2018, shows that  she  is  a  patient  of  Dr  K  Lindley,
       Consultant Gastroenterologist at Great Ormond Street Hospital and of
       Dr F Omisakin at Edwin Lobo Child Development Centre  in  Luton.  Dr
       Omisakin, in her letter of 2nd September 2020, explains that AK  has
       a rare genetic disorder associated with low  muscle  tone,  learning
       difficulties,  difficulties  feeding,  problems  with  weight  gain,
       unusual facial features and disordered breathing. There are very few
       children in the world with this condition. She is unable to  sit  or
       move independently and has very little verbal communication. She has
       to be fed by way of tube from her nose to her lower  gut,  but  this
       system may be changed to one which goes directly to her stomach.  AK
       receives physiotherapy support, support from a dietician,  and  will
       received educational and speech and language  support  in  the  near
       future. It is Dr Omisakin's view that it is in the best interests of
       AK to remain in the UK as all of her clinicians  are  working  as  a
       team, and this team work should not be disrupted particularly  at  a
       time when the Covid-19 pandemic is globally making the  delivery  of
       medical services very difficult,  and  in  addition  it  is  in  the
       interests of other families of children with this condition  for  AK
       to be allowed to remain so that information from  her  care  can  be
       shared.

   15. Mr Melvin submitted for the respondent that reliance was  placed  on
       the reasons for refusal letter of 22nd January 2019 relating to  the
       first appellant and his written submissions of 8th December 2020, as
       well as his oral submissions. He  clarified  that  the  only  points
       taken with respect to dishonesty were with regards  the  discrepancy
       between the April 2014 tax return and the August  2013  Home  Office
       application and not with respect to any other tax returns, as  there
       were some other contentions in  the  original  reasons  for  refusal
       letter.

   16. In summary it is argued by the respondent that the  first  appellant
       is refused indefinite leave to remain under paragraph  276B  of  the
       Immigration Rules because it is said he falls to  be  refused  under
       paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules because  of  discrepancies
       between his  income  declared  to  HMRC  and  the  Home  Office.  In
       particular the appellant declared self- employed earnings  of  �3270
       to HMRC for the tax year ending April 2013 and �13,655 to  HMRC  for
       the tax year ending April 2014, whereas  he  declared  annual  self-
       employed earnings of �30,242 to the Home Office in August 2013.  The
       first appellant said in interview that this discrepancy was  due  to
       human error by his accountant (TS Accountancy Ltd), who had filed  a
       correcting tax return amending the amount of the year  ending  April
       2014 to �28,518, thus making  it  consistent  with  the  information
       provided to the Home Office, and further has provided a letter  from
       TS Accountancy Ltd confirming that the error was made by  them.  The
       respondent view is however that this is  not  an  explanation  which
       satisfies the test of basic plausibility, and  further  it  was  the
       first appellant's responsibility to ensure that his tax  return  was
       accurate, and as such it was undesirable to allow the  appellant  to
       remain in the UK due to his character and conduct.

   17. Further and more specifically it is contended that:

       . There has been no explanation as to why the  first  appellant  used
         two  accountants:  one  to  deal  with  the  Home  Office  Tier   1
         application and one to make the tax return to HMRC in 2013/14.

       . There has been  no  provision  of  the  correspondence  between  TS
         Accountancy Ltd  and  the  first  appellant  with  respect  to  the
         2013/2014 submissions to HMRC.

       . There are no reasons why the first appellant did  not  realise  the
         discrepancy between his  tax  liability  and  the  figures  in  his
         application in 2013 to the respondent earlier.

       . There are no proper reasons as to why there was delay  in  amending
         and repaying the tax liability.

       . There is no proper explanation as to why the discrepancy only  came
         to light when the appellant was applying for ILR.

       . There is no proper explanation as to why TS Accountancy made such a
         large mistake in the 2013/14 tax return.

       . There is no proper explanation as to why the first appellant's self-
         employed income was higher in years when he had  to  apply  to  the
         Home Office, and lower in the years ending  April  2012,  2015  and
         2017 when applications to the respondent were not needed.

       . There is no proper explanation as to why in 2013 nearly all of  the
         self- employed earnings (�28,000) were in May to August 2013,  with
         half of them (�14,000) being in August 2013  and  this  is  not  in
         keeping with the business current account statement  of  the  first
         appellant which was overdrawn in August 2013.

       . There is no evidence of advertising, or the  purchase  of  hardware
         for the first appellant's work such as CCTV cameras or  claims  for
         ladders and motor vehicles which would have been  needed  to  carry
         out the work,  and  there  was  no  evidence  of  extensive  travel
         expenses given that many of the businesses were a long way from his
         home in Luton (only �784 was claimed in travel  expenses  for  that
         tax year), there was  also  no  evidence  of  business  and  public
         liability insurance or  that  the  first  appellant  held  Security
         Systems and Alarm Inspection Board Accreditations needed to install
         alarms,  or  the  security  equipment  installers  licence  or  the
         registered  cablers  licences  or  of  attendance  at  any  further
         training relating to the first appellant's specific areas of work.

       . There is no explanation as to why the first appellant continued  to
         work at KFC if he was/ could be making such large sums from his  IT
         business.

       . Further the fact that there are some corresponding entries in  bank
         statements for the invoices  and  the  fact  that  there  are  some
         letters from clients does not suffice as the bank statement entries
         might be easily falsely created and the client letters used some of
         the same wording and were not on headed paper and so should not  be
         given weight.

       . It is argued that the evidence of the accountant was  not  credible
         because his behaviour with respect to the 2013/2014 tax return  for
         the first appellant was not professional or plausible, and  he  had
         not provided evidence of his having reported himself to the IFA.




   18. As a result it is contended for the respondent that  I  should  find
       that the first appellant's invoices for 2013/2014 are  fictional  in
       large part, as is  the  revised  tax  return,  and  that  they  were
       deceitfully created to obtain an immigration advantage, meaning that
       discretion is properly  exercised  under  paragraph  322(5)  of  the
       Immigration Rules to refuse the first appellant under paragraph 276B
       of the Immigration Rules.

   19. It was also submitted that it would not be  contrary  to  Article  8
       ECHR to require the appellants to leave the UK and return  to  their
       country of nationality, Sri Lanka. The second appellant was  refused
       on the basis that she had no partner who qualified her to remain  on
       the basis of her marriage, as  the  first  appellant  was  correctly
       refused indefinite leave to remain, and again her  removal  was  not
       contrary to Article 8 ECHR.  It is argued that the  tragic  loss  of
       one child by the appellants, and the fact that their other child has
       severe medical issues is insufficient  to  mean  that  it  would  be
       disproportionate to remove them. This is particularly because  there
       is no evidence that the appellants' daughter could not  receive  the
       treatment she needs in Sri Lanka.

   20. Mr Gajjar relied  upon  his  updated  skeleton  argument  dated  7th
       December 2020 and  oral  submissions.  He  submits,  in  summary  as
       follows.

   21. Firstly the Upper Tribunal should find that the first appellant  has
       put forward an innocent explanation that explains  why  his  initial
       submission to the HMRC was less for tax year ending April 2014  than
       the figures given to the Home Office in August 2013 which led to the
       applicant being granted Tier 1 leave to remain.  However,  and  very
       much in the alternative, it is argued that even if he were found  to
       have made  a  dishonest  return  that  should  not  in  all  of  the
       circumstances lead to discretion being exercised to  refuse  him  on
       the basis that this made it undesirable that he should be allowed to
       remain under paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules; and even  if
       it were in some way found to be undesirable that the first appellant
       should be allowed to remain due to dishonesty  it  was  argued  that
       their removal would be disproportionate due to the appellants' first
       child being still born in February 2017 and buried in  the  UK,  and
       their second child born in June 2018  having  general  developmental
       delay, and in the context of  the  length  of  their  residence  and
       economic contribution to the UK.

   22. With respect to the primary contention that the first appellant  has
       provided a plausible innocent explanation for the HMRC/ Home  Office
       discrepancy in the amount of self-employed earnings for the tax year
       2013/2014 it is submitted that it is important that  there  is  only
       one discrepancy in the first appellant's history of  submissions  to
       HMRC, and a corrected HMRC return was made prior to the  application
       for indefinite leave to remain. In August 2013 the  first  appellant
       applied to the Home Office and relied upon �30,242 of self- employed
       income. This amount covered two tax years: 2012/2013 for which �3270
       was declared and 2013/2014 for which initially �13,655 was declared.
       The difference was  therefore  �16,925.  It  is  accepted  that  the
       respondent meets the evidential burden under paragraph 322(5) of the
       Immigration Rules due to the amount of this discrepancy.

   23. It is submitted however that the first appellant raises an  innocent
       explanation going beyond the  minimum  level  of  plausibility  with
       respect to this discrepancy and ultimately that the  respondent  has
       not shown he was dishonest.

   24. In August 2013 the first appellant submitted evidence supporting his
       claimed income of �30,242 from his  self-employed  business  BKE  IT
       Solution,  accompanied by unaudited accounts and letters  from  some
       clients, to the Home Office which was satisfied on  the  balance  of
       probabilities that it was genuine and granted him leave to remain as
       a Tier 1 migrant on this basis  on  10th  October  2013.  The  first
       appellant has a BSc in Information Technology from Sheffield  Hallam
       University and runs a business installing CCTV and electronic tills,
       repairing  PCs  and  the  like  which  is  commensurate   with   his
       qualifications, and he has explained that he uses internet  research
       to make sure he is providing the best up  to  date  service  to  his
       customers. The first appellant has explained that he does  not  need
       accreditations or further training to do this work, and that  he  is
       employed through community contacts running small convenience stores
       to do the work because he is comparatively cheap. He was  not  cross
       examined with regards to his bank statements or the  client  letters
       supporting him being forged so it would not be fair  to  take  these
       points against him, although it should be noted that the writers  of
       the  letters  have  provided  evidence  of  their  identity   and/or
       ownership of the stores and it would be  unlikely  they  would  have
       letterhead as small shop owners. It is argued that this evidence  is
       further support for the  contention  that  the  business  the  first
       appellant does is real,  and  that  he  did  not  make  a  dishonest
       application to the Home Office in 2013.  It is argued that the  fact
       that he has worked harder at his  self-employed  business  in  years
       when he had to meet the target of a certain amount of income for his
       immigration applications does not mean that the work was  not  done.
       There is nothing wrong or dubious with this pattern of work  as  the
       relevant Immigration Rules do not require continuity of income.  The
       first appellant has also given  good  reasons  why  he  prefers  his
       employed work generally in terms  of  working  as  a  team  and  the
       benefits of the PAYE system.

   25. It is argued that  the  following  stand  in  favour  of  the  first
       appellant's credibility: fact that  there  is  only  one  wrong  tax
       return in the context of others which  are  correct  and  consistent
       with information provided to the Home Office; that this  tax  return
       was corrected promptly once the error came to light and the  correct
       tax paid; and that the first appellant would have no motive  not  to
       seek to save a relatively small amount of tax and national insurance
       when he had paid �37,778 over his time in the UK.

   26. Further the self-employed discrepancy in the  original  HMRC  return
       for 2013/2014  is  explained  as  having  been  made  by  the  first
       appellant's  accountant,  Mr  Kulasegaram  of  TS   Accountancy,   a
       contention which is  properly  supported  in  this  appeal  by  oral
       testimony, letters and a statement of truth from him. Mr Kulasegaram
       says that he mixed up the first appellant's records  with  those  of
       another client whose last name was  the  same  as  this  appellant's
       first name at a time when  the  accountant  was  operating  in  very
       difficult professional and personal circumstances. It is clear  from
       the HMRC letter at page 75 of the appellant's bundle that  this  tax
       return was indeed submitted by an accountant.  It  is  to  be  noted
       that there is documentary evidence that TS Accountancy corrected the
       error without charging  the  first  appellant,  and  paid  the  late
       payment interest levy from HMRC OF �332. It is  argued  that  it  is
       plausible that the first appellant did not notice the error as he is
       not an accountant himself; because he did pay �4416 in tax for  that
       tax year;  and because he was preoccupied by the fact that his  wife
       had just arrived from Sri Lanka and  was  finding  it  difficult  to
       adapt to life in the UK. The first appellant learned  of  the  error
       only when he instructed Jein Solicitors in June 2016, which explains
       the timing of the correction of that error in September 2016. It  is
       submitted therefore the first appellant does not fall to be  refused
       under paragraph 322(5)  of  the  Immigration  Rules,  and  therefore
       satisfies paragraph 276B of the Immigration Rules.

   27. However, if  this  is  not  accepted  that  the  appellant  was  not
       dishonest with respect to this tax return, it is argued that in  any
       case discretion should be exercised under paragraph  322(5)  in  the
       first appellant's favour on the basis that: he has been  in  the  UK
       since 2008; he is working as a trainee assistant manager  and  on  a
       self-employed basis and has made a considerable tax contribution  to
       the UK through his work since his arrival; the second appellant  has
       been in the UK lawfully since November 2014; the appellants' son was
       stillborn and is buried in Luton Cemetery, and the appellants  visit
       the grave regularly and get some comfort from this; the  appellants'
       daughter has global developmental delay and is fed through  a  tube,
       has general fragile health due to a very rare genetic condition  and
       it is in her best interests to remain in  the  UK  to  maintain  her
       complex medical care package.

   28. It is also argued that to remove the appellants would be contrary to
       Article 8 ECHR because of their private life ties  with  the  UK  as
       outlined above; and further they  are  self-  supporting  and  speak
       English and it would be in the best interests of their  daughter  to
       be permitted to remain in the UK under  the  care  of  her  team  of
       professionals so that her care continues seamlessly given  her  rare
       condition and fragile health, particularly as the care package  from
       the many professionals is still being established and in the context
       of the global pandemic  affecting  health  care  in  all  countries.



Conclusions - Remaking

   29. The appellants contend firstly that they are entitled to  remain  in
       the UK on the basis of their Article 8 ECHR private life  rights  on
       the basis that the first appellant qualifies for indefinite leave to
       remain under paragraph 276B of the Immigration based on  his  having
       ten years lawful residence. This is refused by the respondent on the
       basis that he falls to be refused  under  paragraph  322(5)  of  the
       Immigration Rules, which is  in  turn  refuted  by  the  appellants.
       Secondly, the appellants claim that they are entitled to remain even
       if they do not succeed by way of paragraph 276B of  the  Immigration
       Rules due to their private life ties with the UK, and in  particular
       the medical problems of their daughter AK, making  their  removal  a
       disproportionate interference with their Article 8 ECHR rights.

   30. The respondent has to show under paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration
       Rules firstly sufficient evidence to raise the  issue  of  fraud  or
       deception, and thus show that she can meet  the  evidential  burden.
       The appellant should, if contesting  the  application  of  paragraph
       322(5), then raise an innocent explanation which will  continue  the
       consideration of the issue  if  it  satisfies  a  minimum  level  of
       plausibility. If that is done  then  the  Secretary  of  State  must
       establish fraud took place on the balance of probabilities,  showing
       thereby that the innocent explanation should  be  rejected,  if  the
       application is properly to be refused under this provision.

   31. In R (on the application of Khan) v SSHD  (Dishonesty,  tax  return,
       paragraph 322(5)) [2018] UKUT 384 (IAC) it is held that where  there
       is a significant difference in the  income  claimed  in  a  previous
       application for leave to remain and the income declared to  HMRC  at
       the same time the respondent is entitled to draw an  inference  that
       an appellant has been deceitful  or  dishonest  and  therefore  that
       he/she should be refused under paragraph 322(5) of  the  Immigration
       Rules absent any plausible explanation for the discrepancy. In  this
       case Mr Gajjar, for the first appellant, properly accepts that there
       was such a significant difference in these amounts  in  relation  to
       the initial tax return for the first appellant for April  2013/April
       2014 and his August 2013 immigration application,  so  the  question
       for this Tribunal is  the  plausibility  of  the  first  appellant's
       explanation.

   32. The Upper Tribunal in   Khan  provides  further  guidance  that  the
       matter  of  plausibility  is  to  be  decided  on  the  balance   of
       probabilities with consideration as to whether the evidence shows an
       appellant to be careless rather  than  dishonest,  and  with  regard
       being paid to the very serious consequence of the  fact  finding  on
       the issue where it may lead to a  refusal  of  indefinite  leave  to
       remain. It is not sufficient for an appellant to  simply  explain  a
       discrepancy by reference  to  accountancy  error,  as  an  appellant
       should have been asked to confirm the tax  return  was  correct  and
       should have known the amount of his earnings on which he was due  to
       pay tax; and further an appellant should have taken steps to  remedy
       any error in a reasonable period of time. When  considering  whether
       the explanation of the accountant being at  fault  is  plausible  it
       will be necessary to consider whether correspondence at the time  of
       the tax return between the accountant and appellant is disclosed  or
       a reason for it being missing is given; whether  it  was  reasonable
       that the appellant did not know he was due  to  pay  more  tax;  and
       whether and how quickly the  appellant  took  steps  to  remedy  the
       situation.

   33. With respect to evidence from accountants in  this  context  it  has
       been said in two different reported decisions, namely  Abbasi  (rule
       43; para 322(5): accountants' evidence) [2020]  UKUT  27  (IAC)  and
       Ashfaq (Balajigari: appeals) [2020] UKUT 226 (IAC) that it is  vital
       that an accountant gives evidence to the Tribunal, and in particular
       oral evidence by reference to a statement of  truth,  regarding  any
       fault on their part in providing inaccurate information to HMRC.  As
       the allegation goes to the  accountant's  professional  standing  it
       would be expected that insurers and the firm's regulatory body would
       have been informed.

   34. The respondent argues that I should find that the  tax  revised  tax
       return for the April 2013/2014 tax year submitted  in  January  2015
       and the business information prepared for the  Home  Office  in  the
       application submitted in August 2013 is, at least in part, fake  and
       therefore dishonest, because the work done by  the  first  appellant
       for his business BKE IT Solution did not, at least  in  large  part,
       take place. I therefore find it the proper place to start is to look
       at the evidence with respect to this business for this period.

   35. I turn first to the documentary evidence. The  first  appellant  has
       provided a schedule of evidence for the  period  September  2012  to
       August 2013 with invoices and references to the bank statements  for
       the amounts entering the account. There are also eight letters  from
       clients confirming with identity papers that the work was  genuinely
       done. Mr Melvin has submitted that  I  should  doubt  the  reference
       letters as two of them written in  October  2020  have  sections  of
       identical wording, namely that of Mr  Jegannathan  and  that  of  Mr
       Gnanesselan. This issue was not put to the appellant for comment  so
       of course there may have been an explanation such as they know  each
       other and discussed how to express the letters, or  both  had  taken
       advice from the first appellant as to what the  Tribunal  needed  to
       understand. I find,  however,  that  given  that  the  other  client
       letters do not  include  any  notable  similarities  and  given  the
       supporting evidence of identity and  business  ownership  that  this
       evidence should be given some weight. Mr Melvin put emphasis on  the
       implausibility of the travel expenses given the distances  that  the
       appellant had travelled for some of the work, but the invoices  only
       include 4 which are not reasonably near to the  appellant  in  Luton
       (the rest being in Luton, London and the south east): there are  two
       trips to Aberystwyth (November and December 2012), one  to  Wallasey
       (May 2013) and one to Northamptonshire (August 2013). I do not  find
       that the travel expenses amount disclosed, of �784, gives any reason
       to believe that the work was not genuinely done. Mr Melvin also said
       that there was evidence that the  amounts  for  staff  training  had
       increased unrealistically over the period of the invoices.  However,
       I find that this is not the case the  amounts  varied  from  �70  to
       �375, with both of these amounts being  billed  in  August  2013.  I
       accept the evidence of  the  appellant  that  the  amounts  depended
       entirely on the clients' requirements. As Mr  Gajjar  has  submitted
       the documentary evidence satisfied the respondent in 2013  to  grant
       the first appellant further leave, and I do not find  that  anything
       which has been said before me causes me not to give it weight.

   36. Mr Melvin also submits that the way in which the business  was  run:
       the lack of public liability insurance after it expired in 2011; the
       lack of a website/advertising; the lack of any on-going training for
       the first appellant; the fact that  the  first  appellant  does  not
       belong to trade associations or hold  accreditation  that  would  be
       open  to  him;  and  the  fact  that  he  apparently  did  not  work
       consistently hard at his self-employed business - slacking off  when
       he did not need to show more income for his immigration applications
       even though he could apparently earn a lot of money from this work -
       means that I should doubt that the business was genuinely conducted.
       The first appellant argues that he genuinely conducted the  business
       in this way  for  the  following  reasons.  It  was  about  offering
       services within his own community  to  small  traders  at  low  cost
       operating within his sphere of knowledge from his degree  topped  up
       by internet research and where they  bought  the  hardware  for  VAT
       reasons. This was very much his second work choice as  he  preferred
       his employed work in a team as a manager at KFC,  and  so  only  did
       this self-employed work to top up his income and only needed to  top
       that income up significantly in certain years  to  comply  with  the
       Immigration Rules. In support of his work with  KFC  there  are  two
       letters in the bundle of documents from managers  which  do  confirm
       his commitment and enjoyment of his work  with  KFC.  Ultimately,  I
       consider that there is no reason to find the manner and  pattern  of
       the work implausible. I can see no reason on the evidence before  me
       to disbelieve that there was a market for a  cheap,  word  of  mouth
       services installing tills, CCTV and providing computing  support  to
       small businesses and individuals within the  first  appellant's  Sri
       Lankan community  which  he  was  able  to  fulfil  in  the  way  he
       describes. He also gives good reasons of team  fellowship,  security
       of income and work/life balance for preferring his employed work and
       is candid about earning more  in  years  when  he  needed  this  for
       immigration application reasons.

   37. Mr Melvin submits that I should not find the evidence credible  with
       respect to the accountancy mistake which is contended to have led to
       the difference in the amount submitted to the Home Office in  August
       2013 and that provided to HMRC in  January  2015.  Mr  Kulasegaram's
       evidence complied with the requirements of a statement of truth  and
       his attending to give oral testimony.  The  evidence  of  the  first
       appellant  and  the  accountant,   Mr   Kulasegaram,   is   entirely
       consistent. It is said that the 2013/2014 tax return for  the  first
       appellant was submitted on the basis of documents  provided  by  him
       but with nothing confirmed in writing by the accountant at the  time
       or after the event. The inaccurate submission to  HMRC  is  said  to
       have came about because expenses relating  to  a  different  client,
       with the same name as the first appellant, were  deducted  from  the
       profits of the first appellant, and it is said that  this  was  only
       discovered by Jein Solicitors when they were preparing to  make  the
       2016 application for indefinite leave  to  remain.  An  amended  tax
       return was then submitted by Mr Kulasegaram at his own expense,  and
       he made a report of the whole matter to his  professional  body  the
       IFA. Both the first  appellant  and  Mr  Kulasegaram  were  able  to
       provide reasons why they had acted with less  than  proper  care  in
       making  this  particular  tax  return:  the  first   appellant   was
       preoccupied with settling his wife into the UK; Mr  Kulasegaram  had
       just taken over TS Accountancy Ltd in November 2014, he found he was
       overwhelmed with work to be completed prior to the 31st January 2015
       deadline; he had to move premises due to a leak in the ceiling;  and
       his wife (who sadly passed way in 2018) was ill with cancer  and  he
       had to deal with taking her to hospital appointments.

   38. The original tax submission was undoubtedly made by  TS  Accountancy
       Ltd on the appellant's behalf as is reflected  in  the  letter  from
       HMRC at page 75 of the bundle. It is also the case that the  NatWest
       bank statement at page 78 of the bundle shows  that  TS  Accountancy
       paid the first appellant back the interest to HMRC which accrued due
       to their mistake. The credibility of the explanation otherwise  lies
       in the credibility of the witnesses: having considered  all  of  the
       evidence in the round I can find no  reason  to  conclude  that  the
       first appellant is not generally a credible witness. He answered all
       questions put to him directly and to the best of his ability. I have
       not found that there is any evidence which leads me to disbelieve in
       his self-employed work for the reasons I set out above.  As  I  have
       noted  the  two  witnesses,  who  gave   their   evidence   entirely
       separately, were totally consistent. Mr Kulasegaram was frank  about
       his professional failings at that particular point in time,  and  on
       consideration of all of the evidence I  find  that  the  discrepancy
       between the submission to the Home Office in August 2013 and to  the
       HMRC in January 2015 when submitting the first appellant's 2013/2014
       tax return was due to the professional failings  of  his  accountant
       and the first appellant's own  failure  to  request  and  check  the
       accounts prior to submission or at least immediately  afterwards.  I
       find therefore that the evidence before me is  of  negligent  rather
       than deceitful behaviour on behalf of both witnesses as I find their
       explanations  to  be  entirely  plausible.  I  find  that  there  is
       therefore no relevant correspondence they could  have  disclosed  to
       the Upper Tribunal; and I accept that as soon  as  the  problem  was
       uncovered by Jein Solicitors that both of them did their best to put
       it right promptly with a revised  tax  submission,  payment  of  the
       outstanding amounts and report to the IFA by Mr Kulasegaram.

   39. I therefore find, on consideration of all of the evidence, that  the
       Secretary of State has not shown on  the  balance  of  probabilities
       that the first appellant has been  deceitful  or  dishonest  in  his
       dealings with the Home Office or HMRC. As it is  accepted  that  the
       first appellant fulfils the requirement of having  10  years  lawful
       residence I find that the first appellant fulfils  the  requirements
       of paragraph 276B of the Immigration Rules as he does not fall to be
       refused under paragraph 322(5) of the general grounds of refusal due
       to having acted dishonestly in the way contended by  the  respondent
       and does not fall to be refused on  the  basis  that  there  is  any
       public interest which makes it  undesirable  for  him  to  be  given
       indefinite leave to remain in the UK.

   40. As the first appellant is able to  show  compliance  with  the  long
       residence Immigration Rules for indefinite leave to  remain  I  find
       that there is no public interest in his being removed from  the  UK.
       In this context I find that the first appellant's removal would be a
       disproportionate interference with his private life rights given his
       work and long residence  in  the  UK;  and  in  light  of  the  best
       interests of his two year old daughter, AK, to remain in the UK  and
       keep the continuity of care through the multitude  of  professionals
       working to support her health and development in light of  her  rare
       genetic condition and the  difficulties  and  risks  that  would  be
       involved in transferring that care to another country in the time of
       the Covid-19 global pandemic which is placing considerable strain on
       all health care systems. I note  in  this  respect  that  the  first
       appellant speaks English and  is  financially  self-sufficient,  and
       treat these factors as neutral matters.

   41. I find  that  the  removal  of  the  second  appellant  would  be  a
       disproportionate interference with her right to  respect  to  family
       life with the first appellant and her daughter, AK, who I have found
       cannot be removed proportionately on private life  grounds  for  the
       reasons set out above. I  note  in  this  respect  that  the  second
       appellant has shown that she has English language qualifications and
       work in the UK with Amazon,  so  I  am  satisfied  that  she  speaks
       English, and as a result of her own work and that  of  her  husband,
       the first  appellant,  is  financially  self-supporting.  These  two
       matters are again treated as neutral factors.



          Decision:

   1. The making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the
      making of an error on a point of law.

   2. I set aside the decision and all of the  findings  of  the  First-tier
      Tribunal.

   3. I remake the appeal by allowing the appeals under Article 8 ECHR.

Annex A: Error of Law Decision




                            DECISION AND REASONS

    Introduction



     1. The appellants are citizens of Sri Lanka, and are a married  couple
        with a baby born in June 2018. The first appellant arrived  in  the
        UK on 31st May 2008 as a student, and was  granted  leave  in  that
        capacity until 18th October 2013.  On 27th September 2013 the first
        appellant applied for an extension of leave as  a  Tier  1  migrant
        which was granted on 18th October 2013 until 10th October 2016.  He
        applied to extend this leave, and then varied this  application  on
        31st May 2018 to an application for  indefinite  leave  to  remain.
        This application was refused in  a  decision  dated  22nd  February
        2019. The second appellant made a human rights application on  10th
        October 2016, and  this  was  refused  in  a  decision  dated  18th
        February 2019. Their appeals against these decisions were dismissed
        by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  NMK  Lawrence  in  a  determination
        promulgated on the 31st May 2019.

    2. Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Mandalia on
       27th August 2019 on the basis that it was arguable that  the  First-
       tier judge had erred in law in refusing the appeal  under  paragraph
       322(5) of the Immigration Rules by  the  wrong  application  of  the
       burden of proof and assessment of the evidence.

    3. The matter came  before  me  to  determine  whether  the  First-tier
       Tribunal had erred in law.

Submissions - Error of Law

    4. In the grounds of appeal it is firstly argued  that  the  First-tier
       Tribunal applied the wrong burden/standard of proof at paragraphs  8
       and 22 where it is  said  that  the  legal  burden  of  proof  under
       paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules lies with  the  appellant,
       as it is claimed that the appellant must rebut the evidential burden
       on the respondent on the balance of  probabilities  whereas  in  the
       Upper Tribunal and High Court it has  been  clearly  said  that  the
       burden on the appellant is only to submit something to a basic level
       of plausibility in response to the evidential burden, and  then  the
       burden switches back to the  respondent  with  the  ultimate  burden
       being on the respondent  to  prove  dishonesty  on  the  balance  of
       probabilities.  This  error  means  that  a  new  hearing   is   the
       appropriate course.

    5. This error has led the First-tier Tribunal to approach the decision-
       making wrongly. At paragraph 19 it is said that it is  difficult  to
       accept two accountants would confuse two  similarly  named  clients,
       when the correct question was whether it was simple implausible that
       two similar named clients would have had their records confused.

    6. Secondly, the appellant also says that there was a material error of
       fact at paragraph 15 with regard to when the first appellant amended
       his tax return: counsel's record of this evidence was that this  was
       done in September 2016, and so there was no contraction in his  oral
       evidence that this was done prior to 18th October 2013  as  asserted
       by the First-tier Tribunal. Another factual mistake in the  evidence
       is found at paragraph  17  of  the  decision  where  the  First-tier
       Tribunal states that there are no amended 2013/14 tax returns before
       the Tribunal, when there were at AB 150, 151 and 167. It was also an
       error of fact to say at paragraph 14 of the decision  that  multiple
       errors were made when in fact this was only in relation to 2013/2014
       tax return.

    7. Thirdly, it  is  argued  by  the  appellants,  that  the  First-tier
       Tribunal acted unfairly by failing to put the contended  mistake  in
       the accountant's letter regarding the  amount  of  the  other  Mr  R
       Kukbakran's expenses set out at paragraph 18 of the decision to  the
       appellant during  oral  evidence,  and  that  a  transcript  of  the
       proceedings should be made available. If this had happened then  the
       appellant would have explained that there was an incorrect figure in
       the accountant's letter at AB 153, but the correct figure was in the
       accountant's letter at AB155, with the incorrect figure in the first
       letter being the amount of the first appellant's net profit

    8. Fourthly,  it is argued that there are irrational findings as to the
       letters provided by the accountant at paragraph 20 of  the  decision
       as it is both said that it is not possible that a mistake  could  be
       made and that weight should be  given  if  it  is  accepted  such  a
       mistake was possible. Further, it is argued that at paragraph 21  of
       the decision it was irrational  to  find  that  the  fact  that  the
       accountants' letters admitting it was their fault were  written  "to
       whom it may concern" meant little weight could  be  given  to  them,
       even though there was also bank statement evidence showing that  the
       accountants had paid the  appellant  the  interest  money  that  had
       become due, which was clearly referenced HMRC in the transfer.

    9. Fifthly, it is argued that  there  were  irrational  conclusions  in
       relation to the appellants' late child (that they could excavate the
       remains - set out at paragraph 31) and a  failure  to  consider  the
       best interests of their other child born in  June  2018  who  has  a
       number of serious medical difficulties, see evidence in ABS 11.

   10. Mr Avery submitted that overall when the decision was looked at as a
       whole the evidence had been thoroughly considered  and  the  correct
       test had practically been applied even if it had not  been  properly
       set out.

   11. I informed the parties that I found that the First-tier Tribunal had
       erred in law and that I would set  out  my  reasons  in  writing.  I
       informed the parties that I would set aside the decision and all  of
       the findings, and remake the appeal de novo.

   12. Mr Gajjar wished  the  matter  to  be  remitted  to  the  First-tier
       Tribunal but I found that it was proper  that  it  remained  in  the
       Upper Tribunal as there would not be an extensive amount of  factual
       remaking as there was only one tax return that was  inaccurate,  and
       so the factual findings that needed to  be  made  to  determine  the
       appeal were primarily only about whether this had been deceptive  or
       not. Mr Avery asked that the remaking be adjourned as he had not had
       an opportunity to look at the rather extensive papers in  detail.  I
       agreed to this as the appellant also wished to seek  an  explanation
       about the error in the first accountants' letter and the reason  for
       the late payment to the first appellant by the  accountants  of  the
       interest on the owed money to HMRC.

Conclusions - Error of Law

   13. The First-tier Tribunal errs in law at paragraph 8 of  the  decision
       with respect to the burden of proof being  on  "the  appellant  from
       start to finish" once the respondent has shown an evidential  burden
       under paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules. As set out  in  the
       case law of the higher courts on this point the Secretary  of  State
       must first adduce sufficient evidence to raise the issue of fraud or
       deception, and thus meet the evidential burden.  The  appellant  can
       then  raise  an  innocent  explanation  which  will   continue   the
       consideration of the issue  if  it  satisfies  a  minimum  level  of
       plausibility. If that is done  then  the  Secretary  of  State  must
       establish fraud took place on the balance of probabilities,  showing
       thereby that the innocent explanation should be rejected.

   14. The First-tier Tribunal errs further in the  consideration  of  this
       matter by not provide sufficiently clear reasoning  as  to  why  the
       first  appellant's  explanation,  supported  by  letters  from   his
       accountants, that it was the accountants fault  based  on  confusing
       two similarly named clients, did not  satisfy  a  minimum  level  of
       plausibility  particularly  as  the  material  went  beyond  a  mere
       assertion that a mistake was  made.  The  fact  that  there  was  an
       erroneous figure in one of the letters admitting  responsibility  is
       not necessarily indictive that  the  accountant  did  not  make  the
       original mistake: there also needed to be reasoning to explain  this
       conclusion.  Further  it  was  not  rational  to   find   that   the
       accountants' letters were undermined in their  evidential  value  by
       being addressed "to whom it may concern".  I find that there is also
       an error in failing to take into account relevant material as it  is
       stated at paragraph 17 of the decision that no amended  tax  returns
       were in the material  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  when  these
       clearly were part of the appellant's bundle; and I find  that  there
       were inadequate reasons  given  to  reject  the  evidence  that  the
       accountant had repaid the first appellant the amount of the interest
       he incurred by making an amended submission to HMRC at paragraph  21
       of the decision.



          Decision:

   1. The making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the
      making of an error on a point of law.

   2. I set aside the decision and all of the  findings  of  the  First-tier
      Tribunal.

   3. I adjourn the remaking hearing.

Directions

   1. Any new evidence for the remaking hearing be served on the other party
      and filed with the Upper Tribunal 10 days in advance of that hearing.
