                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This  is  an  appeal  brought  by  the  Secretary  of  State  with  the
    permission of First-tier Tribunal Judge Nicholson dated 3 March 2016 in
    respect of a decision of First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Barker  which  was
    promulgated on 1 October 2015.  The point raised on  the  appeal  is  a
    short one and I  need  say  little  by  way  of  background  as  it  is
    uncontroversial.  The appellant before the First-tier  Tribunal  was  a
    Mrs Pinalben Patel, who responds to this appeal. Her appeal related  to
    the refusal of an Entry Clearance Officer on 29 July 2014 to  give  her
    the entry clearance.  It had been  sought  under  Appendix  FM  of  the
    Immigration Rules, as a partner. The reason for the  refusal  was  that
    the she did not meet the minimum income  threshold  requirement.  There
    was no dispute on this. It was accepted before the Judge - and affirmed
    before me - that on the basis of the documentation submitted  with  the
    application this financial criterion had not been satisfied.

2.   In the course of the hearing before the First-tier  Tribunal  the  then
    appellant sought to place reliance upon some  additional  documentation
    which had been provided by her partner, the sponsor.  This is  recorded
    in paragraph 9 of the decision.   It  refers  to  two  further  savings
    deposits with The Peoples Co-Op Credit Society Limited which  were  due
    to mature in May 2014 and had a sterling value in the order of  ï¿½1,300.
    It is stated that the partner  had  not  provided  receipts  for  these
    monies to the Entry Clearance Officer because he  had  forgotten  about
    them. He had searched his house on returning  to  India  following  the
    refusal of entry clearance.

3.   It was argued before the First-tier Tribunal that, taken  cumulatively,
    these  monies  would  have  been  sufficient  to  satisfy  the   income
    requirement. When that matter was raised  the  representative  for  the
    Secretary of State made clear that documents must be submitted with the
    application for the purpose of Appendix FM-SE. Regrettably perhaps, the
    representative then proceeded to condescend into a detailed  discussion
    of the content and effect of those receipts and whether  the  purported
    savings would be 'accessible', although this is plainly an  alternative
    and subsidiary argument  in  the  event  that  the  prior  and  primary
    submission on admissible were rejected.

4.   The judge's assessment of this matter is to be found at  paragraphs  22
    and 23 of the decision.  The judge quite properly recognises that under
    Appendix FM-SE, the Tribunal must look at the  financial  circumstances
    at the date of the application and the six months leading  up  to  that
    date. The judge quoted verbatim from Appendix FM-SE D(a) as follows:

         "In deciding an application in  relation  to  which  this  Appendix
         states  that  specified  documents  must  be  provided,  the  Entry
         Clearance Officer or Secretary of State ("the decision maker") will
         consider documents that have been submitted  with  the  application
         and will only consider documents submitted  after  the  application
         where sub-paragraph (b) or (e) applies."


      These  paragraphs  (b)  and  (e)  are  commonly  referred  to  as  the
    evidential flexibility criteria, pursuant to which the ECO may (and  in
    some circumstances must) request additional documents. The judge turned
    his mind to both of them and  came  to  the  conclusion  that  in  this
    instance neither was applicable. He was clearly of the view and  it  is
    undisputedly correct that the evidential flexibility criteria  were  of
    no application. There is no cross-appeal in relation to this issue.

5.   The judge continued at paragraph 23 in the following terms:

         "The documents were not before the Entry Clearance Officer and I do
         not find that the evidential flexibility rules applied which  would
         oblige the officer to seek further evidence. The  question  however
         is whether the Tribunal can consider this evidence. It  was  argued
         by the respondent's representative that  the  Tribunal  should  not
         consider this evidence  in  view  of  the  paragraphs  quoted  from
         Appendix FM-SE D.  However I consider that this is only binding  on
         the "decision maker" and this is specifically defined by the  words
         of the paragraph as the Entry Clearance Officer and  the  Secretary
         of State.  I consider that the evidence may be  considered  and  is
         evidence  of  the  circumstances  at  the  relevant  time.   I   am
         reinforced in this view  because  it  was  necessary  to  enact  in
         Section 85A an exception to prevent evidence being considered by  a
         Tribunal which had not  been  submitted  with  the  application  in
         Points Based Cases.  The  Immigration  Rules  also  had  evidential
         flexibility provisions  in  paragraph  245AA.   There  is  no  such
         exception for partner cases."


6.   Those latter two points have no bearing on  the  interpretation  to  be
    given to Appendix FM-SE D which has been routinely interpreted in  such
    a way that a First-tier Tribunal  when  hearing  an  appeal  should  be
    limited (save where one of the prescribed exceptions  applies)  to  the
    evidence which was submitted with the application. Any other conclusion
    would be wholly inconsistent with the natural meaning of Appendix FM SE
    and indeed would defeat its very purpose.

5.   The appeal has been resisted in  commendably  brief  submissions  which
    recognise the reality that this ground is properly made. The  admission
    into evidence of post-application documents was plainly error  of  law.
    In the circumstances this appeal must be allowed.

6.   Because it has always been conceded that on the basis of  the  material
    presented with the application, the requirements of Appendix FM-SE  are
    not  met,  the  decision  of  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  must   be
    reinstated. I therefore remake the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal
    by formally dismissing the appeal from the  Entry  Clearance  Officer's
    determination.

Notice of Decision

The appeal is allowed.

Decision of First-tier Tribunal remade dismissing the  original  appeal  and
reinstating the decision of the Entry Clearance Officer.

No anonymity direction is made.
