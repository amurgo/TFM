Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr S Kotas, Senior Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr J Plowright, Perera & Co Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Secretary of State appeals with permission against the decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Oakley allowing the Claimant's  appeal  under
    the Immigration Rules.

 2. The Claimant applied for entry clearance as the  spouse  of  a  settled
    person via an application made online on 30 January 2014. In a  Refusal
    Letter dated  19  March  2014,  the  Secretary  of  State  refused  the
    Claimants' application on the basis that the marriage was  not  genuine
    and  subsisting  and  as  the  Claimant  did  not  meet  the  financial
    requirements.

 3.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  promulgated  its  decision   allowing   the
    Claimant's appeal against the refusal on 30 June 2015.

 4. The Appellant appealed  against  that  decision.  The  grounds  may  be
    summarised as follows:

      i) It is arguable that the  judge  made  a  material  misdirection  in
         failing to  properly  consider  the  financial  requirements  under
         Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules, and

     ii) It is arguable that the judge failed to  provide  adequate  reasons
         for finding that the  parties  are  in  a  genuine  and  subsisting
         relationship.

 5. The Appellant was granted permission to appeal by  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Colyer on both grounds, but with considerable reluctance  on  the
    second ground.

 6. I was not provided with a Rule 24 response from  the  Claimant  however
    was provided with a skeleton argument from Mr Plowright of counsel.  At
    the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal, it is noteworthy  that  the
    Claimant was unrepresented whereas the Appellant was.

 7. At the close of submissions, I indicated that I found that there was  a
    material error of law and set aside the decision, however  reserved  my
    determination and reasons on the remaking of the appeal, which I  shall
    now give.

 8. I express my thanks to both parties for their submissions on what was a
    convoluted appeal but upon which the parties were  almost  entirely  in
    agreement. In his  submissions  before  me,  Mr  Kotas  also  took  the
    sensible stance of pursuing ground one upon which permission  had  been
    granted alone.

    Error of Law

 9. The sole basis of challenge by the Appellant was the judge's failure to
    properly consider the financial requirements under Appendix FM  of  the
    Immigration Rules. Both parties were agreed that there was an error  of
    law in the determination because  the  appeal  was  allowed  under  the
    Immigration  Rules  without  regard  to  the  requirement  to   provide
    specified financial evidence by the Claimant's partner and sponsor,  Mr
    A Obiejesi. Mr Plowright accepted that the judge should have noted  the
    absence of three months' payslips but should have  allowed  the  appeal
    and remitted the  matter  to  the  Appellant  for  consideration  under
    Appendix FM-SE D(e). Mr Kotas  submitted  that  as  both  parties  were
    agreed there was an error  concerning  the  absence  of  three  months'
    payslips, and the only issue I needed  to  consider  in  re-making  the
    decision was whether Mr Obiejesi's payslips could have been obtained or
    not and the upshot of that.

10. As both parties were in agreement, I was minded to follow the course of
    action they invited me to follow and  consequently,  I  set  aside  the
    Tribunal's determination in relation  to  the  discrete  issue  of  the
    consideration of the  three  months'  payslips  and  remake  that  sole
    remaining issue  concerning  the  Claimant's  ability  to  satisfy  the
    financial requirement through specified evidence as follows.

    Remaking the Decision

11. The standard of proof is the civil standard and that of the balance  of
    probability. It is for a party that makes any  assertion  to  discharge
    the burden of proof in establishing their assertion,  for  example,  in
    relation to the submission  of  relevant  specified  evidence.  I  have
    considered all the evidence in the appeal, including the Claimant's and
    Appellant's bundles. I heard submissions from both parties,  which  are
    set out in full in my record of proceedings.

12. According to the Immigration Rules, specifically  Appendix  FM-SE  2(a)
    and (c), Mr Obiejesi was required to submit six months' wage slips  and
    corresponding bank statements that would substantiate  the  payment  of
    funds into his account preceding the application  made  on  30  January
    2014. Consequently, Mr Obiejesi needed  to  demonstrate  such  evidence
    from approximately July 2013 to within 28 days of the application  made
    on 30 January 2014 according to Appendix FM-SE 1(l).

13. In remaking the decision, I only need to consider whether the  Claimant
    had provided sufficient payslips in accordance with Appendix FM-SE  and
    if so, any reasons for that omission and the consequences of it.

14. I heard evidence from Mr Obiejesi whom in answer to questions from  his
    counsel confirmed that he had not provided six months' payslips because
    he could not find them all when he came to submit the  application.  Mr
    Obiejesi further stated that his employers were irregular in  providing
    hard copies of his  payslips.  As  he  put  it,  sometimes  they  came,
    sometimes they did not and they may have been  lost  equally.  He  then
    recounted that he spoke to his employer, Walter Lilly, and asked for  a
    copy of his payslips for that period. Walter Lilly confirmed that  they
    could only give him a statement of what he had earned and could not  go
    back past one year however the statement from the employer  would  show
    what Mr Obiejesi earned on a weekly  basis  for  all  of  the  relevant
    months. Mr Obiejesi was shown a copy of a schedule which  both  parties
    had accepted into evidence. That schedule appeared  under  cover  of  a
    letter from Walter Lilly, appending a schedule documenting  weekly  pay
    from 05/07/2013 to 27/12/2013 and reflecting weekly  payments  for  the
    requisite six-month period and totalling �11,356.43 for  the  six-month
    period. Mr Obiejesi confirmed this was the schedule in question he  had
    been given.

15. In cross-examination, Mr Kotas asked  whether  the  employer's  records
    could go back further in time and Mr Obiejesi answered  that  they  did
    not. Mr  Obiejesi  also  was  unaware  whether  his  employer  kept  an
    electronic copy but he had confirmed to the Tribunal all  that  he  had
    been told by his employer.

Submissions

16. I was then addressed by Mr Kotas who submitted that no issue was  taken
    issue with the amount that Mr Obiejesi earns, but  I  could  only  take
    into account evidence appertaining to the date of decision. I was asked
    not to consider Mr Obiejesi's P60, as this was post-decision  evidence.
    Mr Kotas stated that I could however take  into  account  the  schedule
    from Walter Lilly as it related to the status quo before  the  date  of
    decision and went towards the issue of whether Appendix FM-SE D(e)  was
    satisfied or not and indicated that documents cannot be reproduced  and
    showed what Mr Obiejesi was earning previously.

17. Mr Plowright submitted on Mrs  Obiejesi's  behalf  that  the  documents
    before the First-tier Tribunal previously included the bank statements,
    payslips for 3 months and a P60 which demonstrated the net money earned
    for the previous tax year, which  cumulatively  indicated  earnings  in
    excess of �18,600. Specifically, the First-tier Tribunal had a P60  for
    the year ending April 2014 at C29 of the bundle which shows  an  income
    for that year of �21,374.76. Mr Plowright also highlighted  that  there
    were also P60sw for 2012, 2013 anyhow which all  exceeded  �18,600.  Mr
    Plowright contended that given the explanation previously given to  the
    First-tier Tribunal regarding missing payslips which had been confirmed
    today before me also, the  matter  should  be  remitted  to  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer (ECO) to consider whether or not  to  exercise  their
    discretion in the light of the missing payslips and the schedule  which
    corroborate whether Mr Obiejesi was earning the requisite sum.  It  was
    submitted that a valid reason  was  given  for  the  absence  of  three
    months' payslips, namely that the documents are  permanently  lost.  Mr
    Plowright submitted that the income threshold was met, it was just  the
    technicality underlying the evidence submitted which remained at stake.



Findings of Fact

18. Having considered the evidence before me and the oral  evidence  of  Mr
    Obiejesi and his reasons for  failing  to  provide  the  three  months'
    payslips and the schedule from Walter Lilly which is all  that  he  can
    obtain for that period, I  am  satisfied  that  the  appeal  should  be
    allowed to the extent that it is remitted to the ECO for  consideration
    of whether to exercise discretion in light of my findings of fact  that
    follow.

19. Appendix FM-SE D(e) states as follows:

         '(e) Where the decision-maker is satisfied that there  is  a  valid
         reason why a specified document(s) cannot be supplied, e.g. because
         it is not issued in a particular country or  has  been  permanently
         lost,  he  or  she  may  exercise  discretion  not  to  apply   the
         requirement for  the  document(s)  or  to  request  alternative  or
         additional  information  or  document(s)  be   submitted   by   the
         applicant.'

20. Having heard evidence from Mr Obiejesi I accept that he is a witness of
    truth and has permanently lost his missing  documentation,  namely  the
    three months'  payslips.  To  his  credit,  Mr  Obiejesi  has  produced
    evidence from his employer, Walter Lilly, in the form a schedule  which
    appertains to the time of the missing payslips and prior to the date of
    application and which substantiates that his income was  in  excess  of
    the requisite level so that his income over the course  of  six  months
    preceding the application, ending within 28  days  of  the  application
    date, exceeds �9,300 gross by quite some measure.  In  fairness  to  Mr
    Kotas, he did not seek to suggest once that Mr Obiejesi was not  making
    the required sum, simply that three payslips were missing which put him
    in a technical difficulty.

21. I am quite satisfied that there was a valid reason why  those  payslips
    could not and  cannot  be  supplied  still,  namely  because  they  are
    permanently lost, or worse still are  wholly  unavailable  from  Walter
    Lilly as it appears the evidence they can produce in that form does not
    go back more than one year. Consequently, if alternative or  additional
    information or document(s) were to be deemed necessary by the  ECO,  it
    may be of assistance that I express my view that the schedule of income
    provided  by  Mr  Obiejesi's  employer  is  sufficient  on  balance  to
    corroborate the funds entering his bank account  and  demonstrates  his
    income  for  the  relevant  half  year  /  six  month  period  totalled
    �11,356.43 which surpasses the requisite financial threshold for a  six
    month period. This sum is also in keeping with Mr  Obiejesi's  historic
    earnings evident from his P60s that precede  the  date  of  application
    which also exceed the financial threshold.

22. Given those findings  of  fact  and  as  there  is  no  further  matter
    outstanding save for the failure to provide three payslips, I allow the
    appeal to the extent that  this  matter  is  remitted  for  the  urgent
    attention of an ECO, so that he or she may consider whether to exercise
    their discretion not to apply the requirement for the document(s) or to
    request  alternative  or  additional  information  or  document(s)   be
    submitted by the applicant, as deemed necessary.

23. I therefore, do not propose to deal with Appendix FM EX.1 nor Article 8
    ECHR.

24. For the above reasons I set aside the judge's decision and  remake  the
    decision allowing the appeal under the Immigration Rules to the  extent
    indicated.

    Decision

25. I allow the appeal against the decision to refuse entry  clearance  and
    remit this matter for the urgent attention of the ECO for consideration
    of whether to exercise their discretion given my findings  in  relation
    to Appendix FM-SE D(e).

    Fee Award

26. The First-tier Tribunal did not make a fee award and I also do not  see
    fit to make such an award given that evidence appertaining to the  time
    of and preceding the application which was crucial to the just disposal
    of the appeal under Appendix FM-SE D(e) was presented on appeal.
