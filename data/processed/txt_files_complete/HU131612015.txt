For the Appellant:     Mr J M Rene (direct access)
For the Respondent:    Mr P Singh (Senior Home Office Presenting Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is the appeal of Aamir Shahzad Ahmed, a citizen of Pakistan born
       14 June 1986, against the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  of  4
       November 2016 dismissing his appeal brought against the  decision  of
       27 November 2015 to refuse his application for  leave  to  remain  on
       human rights grounds.


    2. The application of 20 May 2015 had been made  on  the  basis  of  his
       connections with this  country  including  his  relationship  with  a
       British citizen, Laura Louise Ahmed, who he had married on 23 October
       2014; a letter from her stated that she feared kidnapping and  murder
       in Pakistan where the culture was totally different to  life  in  the
       UK, where she had a permanent job  with  the  Midlands  Trade  Centre
       (earning �19,200 annually); she was by then pregnant.  The  Appellant
       explained that his family had disowned him because of his marriage to
       a white  British  woman,  and  that  he  would  have  no  support  or
       livelihood in Pakistan; his wife did not speak Urdu, only English.


    3. The application was refused because, whilst the genuine nature of the
       marriage  was  accepted,  it  was  not  considered  that  there  were
       insurmountable obstacles to the couple's relocation to Pakistan:  any
       difficulties for Laura's adaptation to  the  different  cultural  and
       religious beliefs might be hard, but would not  entail  very  serious
       hardship.  The immigration history provided by  the  Respondent  sets
       out that the Appellant arrived with  leave  to  enter  as  a  Tier  4
       student on 25 July 2010, his leave being extended until 20 May  2015.
       An application of 8 January 2015 was refused on 2 March 2015.


    4. The First-tier Tribunal heard the appeal,  apparently  accepting  the
       historical facts asserted in the application. It dismissed the appeal
       because


      a) There were no insurmountable obstacles to life in Pakistan for the
         couple: any problems with the Appellant's family could be avoided
         by relocating to a different part of the country, there was no
         medical evidence as to any difficulties with the child's health
         (it seems an offer was made by the Appellant at the hearing to
         look at the medical records in the form of the Red Book
         customarily given to new mothers, but the Presenting Officer
         declined to do so);



      b) Alternatively the Appellant could return to Pakistan on a short-
         term basis and make an application for entry clearance, and that
         his wife could make appropriate childcare arrangements and resume
         work with the former employer who had given her a favourable
         reference; the reference to the wife's family being unable to help
         her save on the weekends, the claim that there was limited help
         available, because the grandfather had high blood pressure and the
         mother was a working nurse, was considered insufficient, absent
         more precise confirmation of their circumstances. 98% of visa
         applications were considered within 120 days so the period of
         difficulty would not be long.



    5. Grounds of appeal contended that the First-tier  Tribunal's  decision
       was unlawful, for a failure  to  engage  with  the  difficulties  the
       couple would face in Pakistan given the  Appellant's  wife's  British
       background and Western demeanour, and failed to  assess  the  child's
       best interests having regard to the appropriate starting point for  a
       British citizen child.


    6. The First-tier Tribunal granted permission to appeal on 16 March 2017
       on the basis that all grounds were  arguable.   A  Rule  24  response
       asked that the appeal be dismissed as  the  First-tier  Tribunal  had
       properly directed itself.


    7. Before me Mr Rene submitted  that  no  attention  was  given  to  the
       objective evidence that supported the Appellant's claim that  he  and
       his wife would face insurmountable obstacles to life in Pakistan: for
       example, FCO travel advice from May 2015 that set out the  heightened
       threats to British nationals travelling in Pakistan, including  risks
       of kidnapping resulting  in  extended  periods  of  detention.  Other
       evidence  itemised  violent  incidents,   particularly   in   Lahore,
       including suicide attacks on churches  and  assaults  on  Christians.
       Additionally there was no express reference to section 117B  factors,
       which had doubtless contributed  towards  the  wrong  starting  point
       being adopted as to the correct approach to  the  consequences  of  a
       British citizen child's  departure:  no  powerful  reasons  had  been
       identified for considering the infant's relocation to be reasonable.


    8. For the  Respondent,  Mr  Singh  submitted  that  the  considerations
       identified in section 117B were addressed in substance if  not  form,
       given that the Appellant's  English  language  proficiency,  and  the
       precariousness of his  immigration  status,  were  both  specifically
       addressed. The Appellant could return to Pakistan temporarily to seek
       entry clearance, to avoid the whole family  relocating  to  Pakistan:
       the First-tier  Tribunal  had  found  this  to  be  appropriate,  via
       reasoning  that  was  not  irrational.  Terrorist  dangers  were  not
       necessarily greater in Pakistan generally than in  the  UK:  the  FCO
       warnings regarding travel there were reminiscent of the situation  in
       the UK, which after all had itself been  on  a  heightened  state  of
       alert.


      Findings and reasons


    9. I consider that the Appellant's grounds of appeal are made  out,  and
       there are material errors of law in the decision  of  the  First-tier
       Tribunal.


   10. The relevant parts of the Immigration Rules are


         "Section EX: Exception
         EX.1. This paragraph applies if
         (a) (i) the applicant has a genuine and subsisting parental
         relationship with a child who-
           (aa) is under the age of 18 years, or was under the age of 18
           years when the applicant was first granted leave on the basis
           that this paragraph applied;
           (bb) is in the UK;
           (cc) is a British Citizen or has lived in the UK continuously
           for at least the 7 years immediately preceding the date of
           application ;and
           (ii) it would not be reasonable to expect the child to leave the
           UK; or
          (b) the applicant has a genuine and subsisting relationship with a
          partner who is in the UK and is a British Citizen, settled in  the
          UK or in the UK with refugee leave or humanitarian protection, and
          there are  insurmountable  obstacles  to  family  life  with  that
          partner continuing outside the UK."


   11. Firstly, there was no recognition of the appropriate  starting  point
       identified as relevant by Ex.1 vis-�-vis  the  best  interests  of  a
       British citizen child. As stated by Elias LJ in MA (Pakistan)  [2016]
       EWCA Civ 705 �49, Ex.1  "establishes as a starting point  that  leave
       should be granted unless there are powerful reasons to the contrary";
       albeit that �73: "It may be reasonable to require the child to  leave
       where  there  are  good  cogent  reasons,  even  if  they   are   not
       compelling."


   12. It is often said that matters of weight are for the primary  decision
       maker. However, where the alleged defect goes to  the  evaluation  of
       proportionality and lies not simply in the  balancing  of  particular
       factors but in setting the scales in the first place,  the  Court  of
       Appeal has repeatedly recognised that it may  amount  to  a  material
       error of law, see for example Arden LJ in IT  (Jamaica)  [2016]  EWCA
       Civ 932 �2:


           "The tribunals in this case recognised the role  of  the  public
           interest but  fell  into  error  because  they  did  not  direct
           themselves as to the weight to be given to it  in  balancing  it
           against the interests of the applicant and others."


   13. Secondly, there was clearly an evidence-backed case going beyond  the
       norm as to the circumstances in which  the  Appellant  and  his  wife
       would find themselves in Pakistan. She would be a white British woman
       unfamiliar with the culture there. I do not think one can equate  the
       express warnings against travel to the country given by the FCO  with
       the general state  of  alert  regarding  the  prospect  of  terrorist
       outrages in the United Kingdom: there is  a  difference  between  the
       general risks faced by the citizens of a country,  to  those  present
       where  a  particular  religious  or  ethnic  group  of  migrants  are
       targeted. The need to take  measures  to  avoid  standing  out  would
       materially impact on the Sponsor's freedom of movement and ability to
       integrate in  Pakistan,  and  the  couple  would  have  to  face  the
       challenges of making a life for themselves without the social capital
       normally available from a supportive extended family.


   14. Thirdly, the FTT addressed the possibility of the Appellant's  return
       to Pakistan to seek entry clearance there. It did so as part  of  the
       consideration under  the  Rules,  though  that  was  a  mistake:  the
       reliance on the possibility of a short-term return  abroad  to  apply
       for entry clearance is not a consideration posited by the Immigration
       Rules, see eg the headnote to Chen (IJR) [2015]  UKUT  189  (IAC)  at
       (i): there the Upper Tribunal  went  on  to  explain  that  a  strong
       evidence-backed case may demonstrate good reason  for  departing  for
       the general requirement of prior entry clearance,  having  regard  to
       the principle identified in Chikwamba [2008] UKHL 40.


   15. As shown by Hayat (nature of  Chikwamba  principle)  Pakistan  [2011]
       UKUT 444 (IAC), where the only matter weighing  on  the  Respondent's
       side of an Article 8 proportionality balance is the public policy  of
       requiring an application to be made under the Rules from abroad, that
       legitimate objective will usually be outweighed by factors resting on
       the Appellant's side of the balance. As it was put  by  Elias  LJ  in
       Hayat (Pakistan) [2012] EWCA Civ 1054 at [30](b): "Where Article 8 is
       engaged, it will be a disproportionate interference  with  family  or
       private life to enforce such a policy unless, to use the language  of
       Sullivan LJ, there is  a  sensible  reason  for  doing  so."  Similar
       thinking is seen more recently in Agyarko [2017] UKSC 11 �51:


           "Whether the applicant is in the UK unlawfully, or  is  entitled
           to remain in the UK only temporarily, however, the  significance
           of this consideration depends on what the outcome of immigration
           control might otherwise be. For example, if an  applicant  would
           otherwise be automatically deported as a foreign criminal,  then
           the weight of the public interest in his  or  her  removal  will
           generally be very  considerable.  If,  on  the  other  hand,  an
           applicant -  even  if  residing  in  the  UK  unlawfully  -  was
           otherwise certain to be granted leave to enter, at least  if  an
           application were made from outside the UK, then there  might  be
           no  public  interest  in  his  or  her  removal.  The  point  is
           illustrated by the decision in Chikwamba ..."


   16. It seems to me that the First-tier Tribunal failed to have regard  to
       these principles  given  that  an  evidence-backed  case  as  to  the
       difficulties  that  would  be  faced  by  the  Sponsor   absent   the
       Appellant's presence was put  to  it.  Those  problems  included  the
       limited family support that would be available for childcare  because
       of the health problems and professional commitments of relatives. Any
       shortfall in the availability of care would be likely  to  impacts  a
       British citizen  babe-in-arms.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  needed  to
       address how it would be that the child would be  cared  for,  in  the
       light of these difficulties, if the Sponsor returned to work.


   17. This is not an appeal where there are meaningful findings upon  which
       the Upper Tribunal can build, and thus it is allowed  to  the  extent
       that it is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for hearing afresh.
