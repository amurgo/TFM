For the Appellant:     Mr J Collins, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr D Clarke, HOPO


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant has been granted permission to  appeal  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Parkes  dismissing  his  appeal  against  the
    refusal by the Secretary of State  of  his  application  for  leave  to
    remain in the UK on the basis of his private and family life.

2.   The appellant is a citizen of Ghana born on 2 December 1988.   He  came
    to the UK on 15 April 2015 with valid leave to enter as a visitor until
    21 November 2015.  He made an application in an attempt  to  regularise
    his stay on 20 November 2015.  This was rejected on  15  January  2016.
    The respondent then began enforcement action against him  to  which  he
    responded on 24 June 2016, by way of making  representations  regarding
    his family and private life in the UK.  His application was refused  on
    26 October 2016.  The appellant  appealed;  his  appeal  was  heard  in
    August  2018  and  the  judge's  decision  dismissing  his  appeal  was
    promulgated on 4 September 2018.

3.   The appellant and his partner who is his sponsor attended  the  hearing
    and gave evidence.  Together they have six children; the  appellant  is
    the father of the youngest two children.

4.   The appellant said in evidence that he came to support his partner  and
    accepted that he had  overstayed.   The  court  case  his  partner  was
    involved in had been traumatic and he could not leave her.  His partner
    and her husband separated because of the pastor.  Her ex-husband is  in
    the UK but there is a court order preventing contact with the children.
     His partner was on benefits and still is, some have  been  reduced  as
    they are together.

5.   In cross-examination his partner said that  the  appellant  had  always
    lived with her when he was in the UK.  The relationship  with  her  ex-
    husband broke down in 2013 and they separated in June that  year.   She
    lived in a refuge for a few months and when she returned to the  house,
    it was repossessed and then she left for Milton Keynes.  Her ex-husband
    has not seen the children since they split and after an application  in
    2014, there was an order denying him access.

6.   The judge's findings are set out at paragraphs 17 to 29.

7.   The judge said at paragraph 17 that the appellant came to the UK  on  a
    visit visa issued on the specific basis that he would leave the  UK  at
    its expiry.  Since the visit visa expired the appellant has remained in
    the UK illegally and whilst he has made  an  application  to  the  Home
    Office, he has not made any obvious effort to return to Ghana  and  the
    family life that he has created since then  has  to  be  seen  in  that
    light.

8.   At paragraph 18 the judge accepted  that  there  was  evidence  in  the
    papers of the court case in Scotland in which the  appellant's  partner
    gave evidence.  The judge said that came to end in February  2016  when
    the pastor was acquitted  following  the  appeal  hearing  against  his
    conviction the previous year.  There was no retrial.   The  judge  said
    that was over two years ago.  While the appellant's  partner  may  have
    required or desired support that was not a license for the appellant to
    ignore his legal obligations as Jeunesse makes clear.

9.   At paragraph 19 the judge accepted that the  relationship  between  the
    appellant and his partner is genuine and subsisting.  The judge said it
    appears that the relationship has been in place since  his  arrival  in
    2015 and so has lasted for over two years.  However, he found that this
    was undermined by the appellant's illegal status.

10.  The judge accepted at paragraph 20 that all of the children,  including
    the appellant's two children, the youngest of the six children are  all
    British citizens.  He accepted that the appellant's involvement in  the
    lives of the children is what might be expected of an adult living in a
    family.  He accepted that the appellant plays a role in  the  light  of
    all the children and takes an active part in the life  of  his  family.
    The judge said the evidence does not  show  that  any  members  of  the
    family, whether the appellant's partner or any other children, have any
    particular needs or difficulties or that the appellant is  required  in
    the UK to meet a specific need or issue.

11.  The judge held at paragraph 21 that having a child in the UK is  not  a
    by-pass to the requirements of the Immigration Rules and  does  not  by
    itself require that the parent in  question  has  to  be  permitted  to
    remain.   The  best  interests  of   the   children   are   a   primary
    consideration.  Ordinarily it is in the best interests of the  children
    to be brought up by both parents in a stable  and  caring  environment.
    For the older children that is clearly not the case here and there  are
    circumstances where second or even third best has to do.

12.  The judge found that given the appellant plays a  caring  role  in  the
    children's lives in a general sense, he would accept that it  would  be
    in their best interests if he remained in the UK.  The  judge  bore  in
    mind that the appellant's partner managed to cope in  his  absence  and
    that the issue that brought him to the UK  to  provide  support  passed
    over two years ago.

13.  At paragraph 23 the judge found that no matter what the  state  of  the
    appellant's relationship with his partner and the  children,  he  could
    not meet the Immigration Rules.  His partner does not receive  anywhere
    near the ï¿½18,600 required under Appendix FM of the  Immigration  Rules.
    The appellant cannot meet paragraph 276ADE(vi) as he cannot  show  that
    there would be very significant obstacles  to  his  reintegration  into
    Ghana given that he has family life there, and remains in contact  with
    them and only left there three years ago.

14.  The judge then considered the provisions of Section 117B  of  the  2002
    Act in terms of the maintenance of immigration control.  He found  that
    the appellant can speak English but that is only one  factor.   Against
    that is a strong point that the appellant has  established  his  family
    life  when  here  illegally  and  is  very  clearly   not   financially
    independent.  He attached little weight to  his  private  life  or  the
    relationship with his partner established in that light.

15.  The judge found  at  paragraph  25  that  the  appellant's  partner  is
    originally from Zimbabwe and has made the adaptation to living  in  the
    UK.  There is no evidence to show that she could not live in Ghana.

16.  At paragraph 27, so far as paragraph 117(6)  is  concerned,  the  judge
    found that if the appellant leaves the UK, there is  no  evidence  that
    the children would be required to leave the country.   Whilst  the  two
    would be challenging for his partner she managed with  the  four  older
    children before the appellant came to the UK and she could not have had
    any expectation that the appellant would be permitted  to  remain  when
    they chose to start a family life of their own.

17.  The judge found at paragraph 27 that given  the  manner  in  which  the
    facts developed there is a strong implication that  the  appellant  and
    his partner have sought to create a situation creating a fait accompli.
     As Jeunesse makes clear the Secretary  of  State  is  not  obliged  to
    accept that as the obligation is on individuals to abide by their legal
    obligations and in entering expressly as a visitor, the  appellant  and
    his partner could not have been under any illusion  as  to  what  those
    were.

18.  The judge found that not  only  does  the  appellant  have  an  adverse
    immigration history but  the  public  interest  in  the  need  for  the
    appellant to  meet  the  financial  requirement  is  significant.   The
    children involved in this case are not expected to leave the UK.   That
    they may do so if they wish to be with the appellant is a  choice  that
    they have to make but this  is  not  inevitable.   The  fact  that  the
    appellant may struggle in succeeding in an out of  country  application
    does not improve his Article 8  rights,  Ekinci  [2003]  EWCA  Civ  765
    paragraph 17 and that is a decision  that  significantly  predates  the
    2012 Immigration Rules changes.

19.  The judge concluded by saying that the appellant can reapply for  entry
    from Ghana.  The prospects of success are not a matter for the judge in
    this decision and having a child in the UK is  not  a  by-pass  to  the
    Immigration Rules themselves.  He found that it has not been shown that
    it would be disproportionate to expect the appellant to comply with his
    obligations when he has sought to circumvent them.

20.   The  appellant  was  granted  permission  on  all  the  three  grounds
    submitted on his behalf.  In granting permission Judge Blum highlighted
    one of the arguments which stated that it is arguable that at paragraph
    26, the judge asked himself the wrong question  when  applying  Section
    117B(6) of the Immigration  Rules  as  it  is  irrelevant  whether  the
    children would be required to leave the  UK  (SR  (subsisting  parental
    relationship - S117B(6)) Pakistan [2018 UKUT 00334 (IAC).

21.  Mr Clarke admitted that he was in some difficulty because there  was  a
    tension between the Secretary of State's policy and the case  law.   He
    said permission was granted in the light of SR in that the judge was in
    error for arguably  taking  into  account  whether  the  children  were
    required to leave the UK.

22.  Mr Clarke said  that  the  Secretary  of  State  issued  a  new  policy
    guidance on 23rd January 2019.   It  states  that  where  there  is  no
    expectation for a child to leave the UK, then it will not be  necessary
    to consider reasonableness.  Therefore, he cannot go  behind  the  Home
    Office's policy.  So, he will have to argue that the judge was  not  in
    error.  He said SR which was  decided  in  2018  disagrees  with  their
    policy. He said that the new policy maintains the concept of the family
    split.

23.  Mr Collins submitted that the new policy was not in play  at  the  date
    the judge heard the appellant's appeal in August 2018.

24.  Mr Collins submitted that there are six children who  are  all  British
    nationals.  The oldest is 14 years old then 11, 9, 3, 1ï¿½  respectively,
    and the youngest  is  3  months  old.   The  elder  four  are  not  the
    biological children of the appellant.

25.  Mr Collins took me through the judge's decision which  I  have  already
    set out above.  He said that the  decision  was  devoid  of  reasoning,
    merit and not rooted in authority or guidance.

26.  He said that at paragraph 19 of MA (Pakistan) [2016] EWCA Civ 705,  the
    Court of Appeal  states  that  the  only  questions  which  courts  and
    Tribunals need to ask when applying Section 117B(6) are:

    (i)  Is the applicant liable to deportation?  If so,  Section  117B  is
         inapplicable and is that the relevant code will usually be found in
         Section 117C.


    (ii)  Does  the  applicant  have  a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
         relationship with the child?


    (iii)    Is the child a qualifying child as defined in Section 117D?


    (iv) Is it unreasonable  to  expect  the  child  to  leave  the  United
         Kingdom?

27.  Mr Collins submitted that this approach  was  not  disapproved  by  the
    Supreme Court in KO (Nigeria) and Others [2018] UKSC  53.   Mr  Collins
    said that the judge did not consider the question of reasonableness.

28.  Mr Collins said that UTJ Blum granted permission on the  basis  of  SR.
    Headnote 2 of SR states

         "The question of whether it would be reasonable to expect  a  child
         to leave the United Kingdom ('UK') in Section 117B(6) of  the  2002
         Act does not necessarily require a  consideration  of  whether  the
         child will in fact or practice leave the UK.  Rather,  it  poses  a
         straightforward question: would it be reasonable  'to  expect'  the
         child to leave the UK?"

29.  Mr Collins said that paragraph 50 of SR  explains  the  reasons  behind
    headnote 2.  UTJ Plimmer who decided SR said at paragraph 50  that  the
    2018 IDI appears to indicate that Section 117B(6) has "no  application"
    to the case as it only applies where the effect of the  decision  would
    "necessitate the qualifying child in question also having to leave  the
    UK".   UTJ Plimmer rejected the argument that Section 117B(6) was of no
    application to the case as it was unnecessary  to  consider  Article  8
    outside the Rules.  In  her  judgment  this  aspect  of  the  2018  IDI
    provides untenable construction of the plain and  ordinary  meaning  of
    EX.1 and Section 117B(6).  She said the wording in  EX.1  is  reflected
    within Section 117B(6) and insofar as the  guidance  in  the  2018  IDI
    provides the  SSHD's  position  on  the  correct  approach  to  Section
    117B(6)(b).  UTJ Plimmer set out her reasons at  paragraphs  51  to  53
    which led to headnote 2.

30.  Mr Collins submitted that their case is how it can be  remotely  argued
    that a 15-year old child who is not a Ghanaian with a different  father
    can leave the UK.  The same argument can be  said  in  respect  of  the
    partner who is from  Zimbabwe  and  is  not  a  Ghanaian.   Mr  Collins
    submitted  that  on  the  evidence  this  case   should   be   allowed,
    particularly in the light of the unchallenged findings.

31.  I find, as submitted by Mr Clarke, that there is a tension between  the
    policy guidance issued by the Secretary of State in  January  2019  and
    the decision in SR.  SR states in  headnote  2  that  the  question  of
    whether it would not be reasonable to expect a child to leave the UK in
    Section 117B(6)  of  the  2002  Act  does  not  necessarily  require  a
    consideration of whether the child will in fact or practice  leave  the
    UK.   Rather,  it  poses  a  straightforward  question:  would  it   be
    reasonable to expect the child to leave the UK.

32.  I find that the judge did not ask himself this question  and  therefore
    failed to consider whether it would be reasonable to expect  the  child
    to leave the UK.  Consequently, I find that at paragraph 26  the  judge
    erred in law in finding that there was no evidence  that  the  children
    would be required to leave the UK.  That was the wrong consideration.

33.  The judge heard the appellant's appeal in August 2018 and his  decision
    was promulgated on 31 August 2018.   SR which was heard  on  14  August
    2018 was promulgated on 5 September 2018.  Therefore, the judge in  the
    instant case would not have been aware of  the  decision  in  SR.   The
    judge would also  not  have  been  aware  of  the  respondent's  policy
    guidance which was issued in 2019.  However, the judge would have  been
    aware of MA (Pakistan) in  which  the  Court  of  Appeal  set  out  the
    questions which courts  and  Tribunals  needed  to  ask  when  applying
    Section 117B(6).  As submitted by Mr. Collins, this  approach  was  not
    disapproved by the Supreme Court in KO (Nigeria).  I find that  because
    the judge asked himself the wrong question,  he  failed  to  apply  the
    relevant case law.

34.  I accept that there is a  tension  between  the  Secretary  of  State's
    policy issued in 2019 January and the  decision  in  SR.    However,  I
    prefer to follow headnote 2 of SR for the reasons set out in paragraphs
    51 to 53.

35.  For those reasons I find that the judge's decision cannot stand.  As  I
    am of the view that no further evidence is required in this  matter,  I
    have decided to remake the decision.

36.  The findings of fact made by the judge have not been challenged by  the
    respondent.  The appellant came to the UK lawfully  as  a  visitor  and
    prior to the expiry of his visit visa, he made an application to remain
    in the UK.  The application was rejected and he overstayed his leave.

37.  The judge accepted that the  appellant's  partner  was  involved  in  a
    court case in Scotland which was quite traumatic to her and which ended
    in her ex-husband being acquitted following the appeal hearing  against
    his conviction.  The judge also accepted that the relationship  between
    the appellant and his partner was genuine and subsisting  and  that  it
    had been in place since his arrival in 2015 and so had lasted for  over
    two years.

38.  The judge accepted that all the six children including the  appellant's
    two children are British citizens.  The appellant plays a role  in  the
    lives of all the children and takes an active part in the life  of  the
    family.  Given that the appellant plays a caring role in the children's
    lives, the judge accepted that it would be in their best  interests  if
    he remained in the UK.

39.  The question therefore that I  have  to  ask  in  relation  to  Section
    117B(6) is whether it is unreasonable to expect the children  to  leave
    the UK.  At paragraph 20 of MA the Court of Appeal held in relation  to
    the four questions they asked at paragraph 19 that if the answer to the
    first question is no, and to the other  three  questions  is  yes,  the
    conclusion must be that Article 8 is infringed.

40.  The appellant in this case is not liable to deportation. He  does  have
    a genuine and subsisting parental relationship with the children.   All
    six children, including  the  appellant's  two  children,  are  British
    nationals and therefore qualifying children as defined in Section 117D.
     In the light of the ages of the children, and  the  findings  of  fact
    made by the judge, I find that it  is  not  reasonable  to  expect  the
    children to leave the UK in order to maintain their  relationship  with
    the appellant.  In particular the older four children are not  Ghanaian
    with a different father and the appellant's partner  is  from  Zimbabwe
    and is not Ghanaian.

41.  I allow the appellant's appeal.

No anonymity direction is made.
