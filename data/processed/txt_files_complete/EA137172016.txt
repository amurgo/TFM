For the respondent:    Mr L Tarlow, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appellant's  appeal  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Row promulgated 16.11.17, dismissing his appeal  against
    the decision of the Secretary of State, dated 8.11.16,  to  refuse  his
    application made on 7.10.16 for an EEA Family Permit to join his father
    in the UK.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge  Birrell  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    16.4.19.



Error of Law

 3. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that it should be set aside.

 4. The according of weight to evidence is a matter for the  judge.  It  is
    not an arguable error of law for a judge to give too little or too much
    weight to a relevant factor, unless the exercise is irrational. Nor  is
    it an error of law for a judge to fail to deal with every factual issue
    of argument. Disagreement  with  a  judge's  factual  conclusions,  the
    appraisal  of  the  evidence  or  assessment  of  credibility,  or  the
    evaluation of risk does not give rise to an error of law. Nor is it  an
    error of law for a judge not to  have  regard  to  evidence  of  events
    arising after the decision or for no account  to  have  been  taken  of
    evidence not put before the tribunal.  Irrationality  is  a  very  high
    threshold  and  a  conclusion  is  not  irrational  just  because  some
    alternative explanation  has  been  rejected  or  can  be  said  to  be
    possible. Nor is it necessary to consider  every  possible  alternative
    inference consistent with truthfulness because a  judge  has  concluded
    that the story proffered is untrue. However, if a point of evidence  of
    significance has been ignored or misunderstood, that may be  a  failure
    to take into account a material consideration.

 5. The application was refused following consideration of regulation 8  of
    the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006, on the  basis  that  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer was not satisfied that the appellant  was  wholly  or
    mainly financially dependent on his sponsoring father. However, it  was
    accepted that the sponsor regularly remitted money to the appellant and
    that he lives in a house owned by his father.

 6. For the reasons set out in the tribunal's decision, Judge Row  was  not
    satisfied that the appellant is financially dependent on  the  sponsor.
    In particular, the judge highlighted concerns in respect of  the  money
    transfers between [11] and [15].

 7. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Birrell considered it  arguable
    that the First-tier Tribunal Judge  erred  in  his  assessment  of  the
    dependency test when at [9] he asked why a fit and healthy 27 year  old
    would be dependent on his  father.  Judge  Birrell  drew  attention  to
    Moneke  (EEA  -  OFMS)  Nigeria  [2011]  UKUT  00341  (IAC)   and   the
    respondent's own guidance to  point  out  that  there  is  no  need  to
    determine the reasons for recourse to the financial support provided by
    the EEA national sponsor, or to consider whether the appellant is  able
    to support himself by taking up paid employment.

 8. Mr Ahsan sought to rely on a 1987 decision of the ECJ on the issue that
    there is no need to determine the reasons  for  recourse  to  financial
    support. However, Mr Tarlow conceded that point.

 9. Mr Ahsan's submissions were to the effect that the alleged error at [9]
    of the decision affected and infected the rest of the decision and  the
    judge's reasons.

10. It is not clear to me that  the  judge  was  in  fact  relying  on  the
    rhetorical question asked at [9] of the decision  but  the  judge  also
    pointed out that the sponsor was unwell, had not worked for a year  and
    his sole income was Employment and Support Allowance  of  ï¿½73.10.  Even
    though it was not necessary to determine the reasons for dependency,  I
    am satisfied that it was open to the  judge  to  assess  the  issue  of
    dependency in the light of the circumstances of both the appellant  and
    the sponsor.

11. Further, the real basis for dismissal of the appeal arises from the two
    matters of concern to the tribunal and it is respect of  those  matters
    that the actual findings are made from paragraph [10]  onwards  of  the
    decision.

12. These are, first, the fact that the latest two money transfers were not
    from the sponsor at all, but two others.  The  judge  rejected  as  not
    credible the explanation that the sponsor had given them the  money  to
    send because on each occasion, in July and again  in  October  2017  he
    happened to have  been  ill.  Second,  the  only  withdrawal  from  the
    appellant's bank account was by cheque made payable  to  the  sponsor's
    daughter-in-law, which the sponsor  said  was  to  settle  a  bill  for
    decoration of the house. Not a single other withdrawal  was  made  from
    the appellant's account over a period of two years, whilst at the  same
    time the credit balance of Rs6,000 remained undisturbed.

13. The explanation for this proffered on behalf of the appellant  is  that
    the money transfers were made and collected  in  cash,  but  the  judge
    found that although there were money transfer documents, there  was  no
    evidential trace of what happened to those monies; evidently they  were
    not paid into the bank account, even though the appellant banked one of
    the money transfers, that which was later withdrawn by cheque  for  the
    purpose of settling the claimed decoration bill.

14. Having considered the matter in detail, the judge found that there were
    sufficient queries about the documentation and evidence as to the money
    transfers to conclude that the sponsor and the appellant had  not  been
    open about the appellant's  true  financial  circumstances.  The  judge
    considered the possibility that the money transfers were made  to  give
    the impression that the appellant  was  financially  dependent  on  the
    sponsor when that was not necessarily the case. The judge concluded  on
    this evidence that the appellant  failed  to  demonstrate  that  he  is
    financially dependent on the sponsor,  even  though  he  lives  in  the
    family home owned by the sponsor.

15. I am satisfied that the reasoning of the judge in relation to the money
    transfers stands independent of the rhetorical question as to  why  the
    appellant would be financially dependent on the sponsor.  The  question
    was not in fact answered and  the  findings  clearly  relate  to  other
    issues of concern.

16. The grounds complain that the judge was wrong to  give  weight  to  the
    absence of withdrawals from the account. With respect, the question  of
    weight to be given to evidence is a matter for the judge to  assess.  I
    am satisfied it was open to the judge to find that  the  appellant  and
    the sponsor had not been open about their true financial  circumstances
    and to conclude that the appellant had failed to  demonstrate  that  he
    was financially dependent on the sponsor. The judge gave cogent reasons
    why the evidence in relation to money transfers was unsatisfactory.  In
    the circumstances, the error in [9], if it was an error, in relation to
    questioning why the appellant would be dependent on the sponsor was not
    material to the outcome of the  appeal.  At  [15]  the  judge  reminded
    himself that the burden of proof was on the appellant  and  found  that
    there were sufficient outstanding queries about the documents relied on
    by the appellant to doubt the true financial  circumstances.  For  that
    reason, I find no error of  law  in  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

Decision

17. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should
    be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order  pursuant  to  rule  13(1)  of  the  Tribunal
Procedure Rules 2014.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.




Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
pursuant to section 12(4)(a) of the Tribunals, Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed and thus there can be no fee award.
