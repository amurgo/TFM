                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent

For the Appellant:     Mrs F Farrell, of Peter G Farrell, Solicitor
For the Respondent:    Mrs M O'Brien, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1.  In  her  decision  promulgated  on  22  August  2016,  dismissing  the
    appellant's appeal, First-tier Tribunal Judge Kempton found  in  effect
    at �33 - 34 that the appellant meets the definition in article  1A  (2)
    of the Refugee Convention, and is a refugee from Syria.

 2. The respondent does not propose to remove the appellant to  Syria,  but
    to Egypt.  He had been living there legally.   His  wife  and  daughter
    remain in that country.  The  refusal  letter  says  at  �52  that  the
    appellant has residence rights and could arrange to return there.

 3. The Judge rejected the appellant's claim to be at risk in  Egypt.   His
    grounds of appeal to the UT do not challenge  those  findings  (rightly
    so, as no arguable legal error is discernible in them).

 4. The Judge thought at �42 that although the Egyptian authorities had  no
    interest in the appellant, there might be difficulty in  returning  him
    in the absence of a passport and other documentation.  It appears  that
    the appellant arrived in the UK on a valid Syrian passport,  which  has
    since expired.

 5. The grounds of appeal to the UT argue that  in  the  absence  of  "safe
    third country" certification under �345 of the  immigration  rules  the
    respondent's decision was "unlawful", and the appeal should  have  been
    allowed because in terms of �334(v) the appellant would be required  to
    go to a country where he faced persecution (Syria).

 6. That is misconceived.  The provisions of �345 relate to  return  of  an
    asylum applicant to another country for substantive examination of  the
    application there.  This appellant's application has been  examined  in
    the UK.  The respondent's proposal is that  he  should  return,  or  be
    removed, to a country where he does not face persecution (Egypt).

 7. The jurisdiction of tribunals under s. 84(1) (a) (b) and (c) and s.  86
    (2) of the 2002 Act is to decide whether  removal  "would  breach"  the
    UK's obligations in respect of  the  Refugee  Convention,  humanitarian
    protection or the Human Rights Convention.   That  plainly  requires  a
    decision on the hypothesis of removal taking place.

 8. Whether removal to Egypt is  practical  or  likely  is  irrelevant  for
    appeal purposes.  In absence of a finding that removal of the appellant
    to the country proposed would breach the UK's  obligations,  the  Judge
    could do nothing other than dismiss the appeal.

 9. That might be thought to have potentially unfortunate results,  leaving
    the appellant in limbo, but such issues are for resolution between  the
    appellant and the respondent, and if necessary  in  other  proceedings,
    not by statutory appeal under the 2002 Act.

10. In this case, we think it might  be  useful  to  observe  that  pending
    removal the appellant, having the status of a refugee  from  Syria,  is
    entitled to be treated as such - for example,  in  relation  to  taking
    employment and access to welfare,  under  Chapters  III  &  IV  of  the
    Refugee Convention.

11. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.

12. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
