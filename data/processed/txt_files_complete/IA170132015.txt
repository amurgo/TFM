For the Appellant:     Mr D Ayodele, Goodfellows Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr L Tarlow, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. The appellant is a national of Pakistan born on  1  January  1959.  He
      appeals  with  permission  against  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge  D  Telford,  who  dismissed  his  appeal  against  the
      decision of the respondent refusing his application  to  remain  under
      paragraph 276B of the Immigration Rules. The decision was  promulgated
      on 12 December 2016.

   2. First-tier Tribunal Judge Telford noted  that  the  refusal  was  made
      under paragraph 322(1)A of the  Immigration  Rules  as  the  appellant
      claimed to be in possession of a genuine ESOL certificate which  would
      show that he had a certain command of the English language as required
      under paragraph 276B of the Rules.

   3. He found at [8] that  the  appellant  had  not  shown  that  the  ESOL
      certificate was validly obtained by him.

   4. On 20 June 2017 First-tier Tribunal Judge Ford granted  the  appellant
      permission to appeal.

   5. An application dated 9 August 2017 to admit further evidence  pursuant
      to Rule 152A of the 2008 Rules was  not  proceeded  with.  Mr  Ayodele
      relied in particular on ground 2 and 4 of the grounds of appeal.

   6. Mr Ayodele, who represented the appellant at  the  hearing,  submitted
      with regard to the finding at [8] that the Judge did not  have  proper
      regard to the burden of proof as set out  in  decisions  including  AA
      (Nigeria) v SSHD [2010] EWCA Civ 773 and SM and Qadir v  SSHD  (ETS  -
      Evidence - Burden of Proof) [2016] UKUT 229 (IAC).

   7. The Judge therefore failed to consider that the burden of proof  "lies
      with" the respondent on the balance of  probabilities  to  demonstrate
      that  the  appellant  relied  on  a  false  document  to  support  his
      application. That he contended was a clear error of law as the  burden
      was with the respondent on the balance of probabilities.

   8. In the reasons for refusal the respondent referred to an interview  on
      8 March 2015 after which it was concluded that  it  was  not  credible
      that the appellant had successfully achieved entry  level  certificate
      in ESOL  having  regard  to  the  discrepancies  in  his  account.  He
      struggled to answer questions asked and had a poor level  of  English.
      The respondent was satisfied that there was  substantial  evidence  to
      conclude that the certificate produced had been fraudulently obtained.
       The appellant achieved a first class pass when tested.

   9. The appellant asserted  in  his  witness  statement  produced  to  the
      Tribunal that he believes that the ESOL certificate issued to him  was
      genuine after he passed the test. He  had  a  written  interview  test
      where he had  to  write  his  name,  date  of  birth  and  some  other
      questions. He said he can speak little English and can also  read  and
      write his name in English. He understands the  English  language  "but
      little."

  10. The grounds also  assert  that  the  Judge  failed  to  give  adequate
      consideration to the plausible reasons given by the appellant  in  his
      witness statement. The English language is neither his  mother  tongue
      nor his first language.  It was wrong for the Judge to make  a  formal
      assessment of the appellant's  standard  of  English.  The  Judge  was
      required to  support  an  allegation  of  deception  on  the  evidence
      produced.

  11. Mr Ayodele submitted that deception in  this  case  322(1)(a)  entails
      dishonesty - AA v SSHD paragraph 75.

  12. Mr Ayodele also submitted (ground 4) that the Judge failed to  make  a
      finding or give adequate reasons in respect of paragraph 276ADE of the
      Rules. There the Judge stated at  [13]  that  the  appellant  produced
      little or no documentary evidence of his own 20 or more years  claimed
      life in the UK. The logic was because it may be common for some people
      not to have any documentary evidence of their lives over the  past  20
      or so years, it must follow that he is one of  those  persons  and  so
      nobody should even attempt to look at why he  produced  little  or  no
      documentary evidence. He found that this was poor  logic  based  on  a
      false premise [13].

  13. On behalf of the respondent Mr Tarlow  submitted  that  even  assuming
      that the Judge's "finding" at [8] that the  appellant  has  not  shown
      that the ESOL certificate was validly obtained by him, is an error, it
      was however not material in the circumstances. He referred to [11]  of
      the decision. The Judge referred to some of the questions asked in his
      interview of March 2015. His command of English was so  poor  that  he
      must have known that the certificate he produced was false. He did not
      accept at[11] that on the proper standard of proof "the respondent has
      failed to show the certificate was false."

  14. Accordingly, the Judge did properly direct himself as to the burden of
      proof being on the respondent.

  15. In the reasons for refusal, the respondent has set out the  basis  for
      the conclusion that  it  was  not  credible  that  the  appellant  had
      successfully achieved the entry level  certificate.  He  struggled  to
      answer  questions  asked  and  had  a  poor  level  of  English   when
      interviewed. There was  substantial  evidence  to  conclude  that  the
      certificate produced was fraudulently obtained.

  16. The interviewing officer concluded that it is not credible that he has
      a genuine qualification as he struggled to answer the questions  asked
      and had a poor command of English.

  17. Mr Tarlow referred to and relied on the full interview set out in  the
      respondent's bundle from D3 onwards.

  18. After question 17, the interviewer did not put the questions 18-25  to
      the appellant (D6). His answers to other questions had not been to the
      point. The later  questions  were  not  asked  having  regard  to  his
      inability to answer the earlier questions meaningfully.

  19. He submitted that the Judge's conclusion is justified in the light  of
      the evidence as a whole.

  20. In reply Mr Ayodole submitted that the appellant has answered all  the
      questions fully, but he "understood to an extent."

      Assessment

  21. The Judge has clearly erred, when stating at [8]  that  the  appellant
      has not shown that the ESOL certificate was validly obtained  by  him.
      The burden  of  proof  is  with  the  respondent  on  the  balance  of
      probabilities.

  22. Nevertheless, it is evident that the Judge was in fact aware that  the
      respondent had the legal burden of proof when finding at [11] that  he
      did not accept that on the proper standard of proof the respondent has
      failed to show that the certificate was false.

  23. It is contended by Mr Ayodele that there was not a  proper  evidential
      basis for such finding. The respondent had the burden of proof.

  24. I consider the basis for such finding as derived from the interview in
      March 2015.

  25. The  appellant  confirmed  at  the  outset  that  he  was  fit  to  be
      interviewed.  His  responses  to  some  of  the  immigration   history
      questions asked were clearly not appropriate.

  26. I set out examples of inappropriate replies to questions asked at  the
      interview. When asked what his current immigration status was, he said
      that he came to Heathrow Airport on 1 January 1993.

  27. When asked how he chose the course before taking the English test  and
      whether it was recommended to him, he stated that he did not know  and
      does not remember.

  28. When asked how often he attended the course he stated  "three  days  a
      week go" (I presume he went three days a week).

  29. He was asked why he chose this English language test. His response was
      that this was a long time ago, "my memory is not good now." When asked
      whether anyone recommended the test to him he stated that he wanted to
      learn English too much. He looked at Tooting and other  colleges.  The
      Home Office wanted it.

  30. He said that the test cost "maybe ï¿½100." He booked the test.

  31. The test lasted one day. It involved only English. He  said  he  loves
      English. He looked at other colleges in Broadway.

  32. He was asked how long it  took  him  to  obtain  the  certificate.  He
      replied "sister, I don't understand what you say."  The  question  was
      repeated and he said he gave him a paper after one and a half months.

  33. He was asked where he took the Life in the UK test. He  answered  "no,
      no, maybe I will look for a nice college just one test B1".

  34. In the closing questions he was asked whether he  has  understood  all
      the questions. He replied "now I am here a long time, you give me this
      work now, long time no work allow, you give me please."

  35. He was asked whether he would like to ask any questions. He said he is
      happy - no problem - he loves the UK "good country, nice people.  Long
      time here I want stay good country."

  36. In the test certificate from City and Guilds relating to  entry  level
      certificate in ESOL International (spoken) (achiever) B1, it is  noted
      that the appellant  attended  Universal  Professional  and  Vocational
      College on 20 November 2013 and achieved a "first class pass". At  D2,
      a notification of candidate results are produced from City and  Guilds
      (not a certificate)  in  which  the  written  assessment  held  on  20
      November 2013 recorded that he achieved a first class pass.

  37. The Judge had regard to evidence of the appellant which he found to be
      "incredible" [9]. He did not accept his evidence that he followed  the
      correct procedure in obtaining the ESOL certificate.

  38. He stated that '....the submission that this is  a  fairly  easy  test
      (whatever that means) is not the point'. In particular, he  found  the
      appellant to be illiterate in English and could  barely  speak  a  few
      words of English. He cannot understand  basic  questions  or  phrases.
      This is nowhere near what is required even from the  most  basic  ESOL
      test [9].

  39. The Judge noted that the appellant simply failed  to  understand  many
      basic phrases in English at the outset of the case and had to use  the
      interpreter "in his  own  tongue  throughout  the  proceedings".  This
      undermined his submission that he was  easily  able  to  complete  the
      test. The lack of fluency in English is very much an understatement of
      his capability in English. In the circumstances he found that it would
      be surprising if he had been in the  UK  for  20  or  more  continuous
      years.

  40. He found that the appellant answered some questions in  the  interview
      in March 2015 but his command of English was and is so  poor  he  must
      have known that the certificate he produced was false.

  41. It was noted that none of the witnesses produced sought to argue  that
      the appellant ever spoke to them in English, preferring throughout his
      time to use Urdu.

  42. The Judge had regard to the submission that because it may  be  common
      for some people not to have any documentary evidence  of  their  lives
      over the past 20 or so years that it must follow that the appellant is
      one of those persons and so one should not even attempt to look at why
      he produced little or no documentary evidence of his own  20  or  more
      years claimed life in the UK. That he found to be poor logic based  on
      the false premise that because some of a set of persons act in one way
      it somehow necessarily means that this appellant does [13].

  43. Nor did the appellant provide  any  other  evidence  why  he  took  no
      reasonable steps to provide evidence of his life in other forms. There
      is not a whole map or even a sensible piecemeal map of his life in the
      UK as a resident continuously for 20 or more years.  Evidence  of  his
      witnesses  was  generalised  and  referred  more  to   character   and
      friendship [14].

  44. Nor should be be accorded "the benefit of the doubt"  as  to  what  he
      says because to have any documents might mean that he would have  been
      detained and lost his chance of living there for  20  or  more  years.
      There was no such legal test. He had failed to  provide  a  reasonable
      explanation as to why he cannot or will not provide any sound evidence
      in any form of his stay here [15].

  45. Moreover, the test is not as asserted, that it is  "reasonably  clear"
      that he has been here since 1992. He has to show  on  the  balance  of
      probabilities that this was so [16].

  46. The evidence in  his  witness  statement  and  "live  form"  does  not
      establish that he was in the UK continuously or  residing  here  [17].
      One of the witnesses stated that she has known him in the  UK  for  15
      years; another for 18 years whilst another stated that he knew him  in
      the UK for 10 years.

  47. The Judge noted his claim to have worked as a tailor but there  is  no
      record of any tax or National Insurance paid.  Nor  did  he  have  any
      partner or family life or child in the UK [19].

  48. I find that the Judge has given a careful decision. He has  considered
      the evidence as a whole, including the appellant's performance at  the
      hearing which took place on 12 December 2016. The Judge found that his
      English was poor and that he failed to understand many  basic  phrases
      and had to have an interpreter throughout the  proceedings.  The  ESOL
      test was moreover undertaken in November 2013, more than  three  years
      prior to his giving evidence before the First-tier Tribunal.

  49. The Judge has had proper regard to  the  interview  record  itself  in
      which it was concluded that it was not credible, having regard to  his
      poor  level  of  English  and  comprehension,  and  his  struggle  and
      inability to answer basic questions asked, that  he  had  successfully
      achieved an entry level certificate in ESOL which resulted in a  first
      class pass in both written and spoken ESOL.

  50. In the circumstances the Judge did  not  accept  that  on  the  proper
      standard  of  proof  the  respondent  had  failed  to  show  that  the
      certificate  was  false  [11].   That  was  a  conclusion   that   was
      sustainable on the evidence produced.
