Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Bedford of Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr Mills a Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background

      1. The Respondent notified the Appellant on  9  January  2015  of  her
         decision to refuse to grant asylum  or  ancillary  protection.  The
         appeal against that decision was dismissed by  First-tier  Tribunal
         Judge McDade ("the Judge") following a hearing on  11  March  2015.
         This is an appeal against that decision. It is not necessary for me
         to provide any factual detail of the claim.

      2. Upper Judge McWilliam granted permission to appeal on 24 July  2015
         as it was  arguable  that  findings  of  inconsistencies  were  not
         grounded in the evidence.

      3. Mr Mills conceded, despite the rule 24 notice, that the  Judge  had
         materially erred in taking discrepancies that had arisen between  a
         draft statement the Appellant had not seen or approved as against a
         later statement that she did  approve  into  account,  despite  the
         error having been admitted by the Solicitor prior to  the  hearing.
         Mr  Mills  conceded  that   the   Judge   had   highlighted   those
         discrepancies, relied upon them, and had been wrong to  do  so.  He
         accepted that it affected the decision to such an extent  that  the
         decision could not stand and the matter would need to  be  remitted
         for a de novo hearing with no facts being preserved.

      4. Mr Bedford agreed.

      5. So did I.

Decision

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.

    I set aside the decision.

    The matter shall be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for a  de  novo
    hearing before a Judge other than Judge McDade. The time estimate is  3
    hours and a Farsi speaking interpreter is required.
