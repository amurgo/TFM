A. Historic injustice

(1) For the future, the expression "historic  injustice",  as  used  in  the
immigration context, should be reserved for cases such as  those  concerning
certain British Overseas  citizens  or  families  of  Gurkha  ex-servicemen,
which involve a belated recognition by the United Kingdom government that  a
particular class of persons was wrongly treated, in  immigration  terms,  in
the past; and that this injustice  should  be  recognised  in  dealing  with
applications made now  (eg  Patel  and  Others  v  Entry  Clearance  Officer
(Mumbai) [2010] EWCA Civ 17; AP (India) v Secretary of State  for  the  Home
Department [2015] EWCA Civ 89).

(2) The fact that the injustice exists will be uncontroversial. It  will  be
generally recognised. It will  apply  to  a  particular  class  of  persons.
Unlike cases of what might  be  described  as  "historical  injustice",  the
operation  of  historic  injustice  will  not  depend  on   the   particular
interaction between the individual member of the class and the Secretary  of
State. The effects of historic injustice on the immigration position of  the
individual are  likely  to  be  profound,  even  determinative  of  success,
provided that there is  nothing  materially  adverse  in  their  immigration
history.

B. Historical injustice

(3) Cases that may be described  as  involving  "historical  injustice"  are
where the individual has suffered as a result of the wrongful operation  (or
non-operation) by the Secretary  of  State  of  her  immigration  functions.
Examples are where the Secretary of State has failed to give  an  individual
the benefit  of  a  relevant  immigration  policy  (eg  AA  (Afghanistan)  v
Secretary of State for the Home Department [2007] EWCA Civ 12); where  delay
in reaching decisions is  the  result  of  a  dysfunctional  system  (eg  EB
(Kosovo) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2008]  UKHL  41);  or
where the Secretary of State forms a view about an  individual's  activities
or behaviour, which leads to an adverse immigration decision; but where  her
view turns out to be mistaken (eg Ahsan v Secretary of State  for  the  Home
Department [2017] EWCA Civ 2009). Each of these failings may have an  effect
on an individual's Article 8 ECHR case; but  the  ways  in  which  this  may
happen differ from the true "historic injustice" category.

C. Part 5A of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and the
weight to be given to the maintenance of effective immigration controls

(4) In all cases where, for whatever reason,  the  public  interest  in  the
maintenance of effective immigration controls falls to be  given  less  than
its ordinary weight, the usual course should be for the judge so to find  in
terms, when addressing section 117B(1) of the 2002 Act. The same result  may
be achieved, at least in some situations, by  qualifying  the  consideration
in section 117B(4) that little weight should be  given  to  a  private  life
formed when the person  concerned  is  in  the  United  Kingdom  unlawfully.
Judicial  fact-finders  should,  however,  avoid  any  recourse  to  double-
counting,  whereby  not  only  is  the  weight  to  be  given  to  effective
immigration controls diminished but also, for the  same  reason,  a  private
life is given more weight than would otherwise be possible by the  undiluted
application of section 117B(4).

(5) The weight to be given to the public  interest  in  the  maintenance  of
effective  immigration  controls  is  unlikely  to  be  reduced  because  of
disappointments or inadequacies encountered  by  individuals  from  teaching
institutions or employers.







                            DECISION AND REASONS


A. INTRODUCTION

 1.  "Historic ? adj.  1. Famous or important in  history,  or  potentially
    so. > archaic  of the past.  2.  Grammar  (of  a  tense)  used  in  the
    narration of past events, especially  Latin  and  Greek  imperfect  and
    pluperfect.

    Historical ? adj.  of or concerning history > belonging to  or  set  in
    the past.  > (of the study of a subject) based on an  analysis  of  its
    development over a period.

      ...

      Injustice  ?   n.   1.   Lack  of  justice.   2.   An  unjust  act  or
      occurrence."

                   Concise Oxford English Dictionary (10th edition, revised)

 2. The appellant, a citizen of India born in 1988, contends that  she  has
    suffered a historic injustice and that this should play a material part
    in the assessment of whether her removal from the United Kingdom  would
    constitute a disproportionate interference  with  her  Article  8  ECHR
    rights, consequent upon the refusal by  the  respondent  of  her  human
    rights  claim.   The  appellant  says  that  the  First-tier   Tribunal
    committed an error of law in failing to identify  and  give  effect  to
    this matter, when it dismissed her appeal against that refusal.

 3. The appellant first entered the United Kingdom in  October  2010,  with
    entry clearance as a Tier 4 (General) Student.  In February  2012,  one
    day before the expiry of her leave  in  that  capacity,  the  appellant
    applied for leave to remain as a Tier  1  (Highly  Skilled  Post-Study)
    Migrant.  Her application was successful.  She  was  granted  leave  in
    that capacity until 28 May 2014.

 4. On 25 June 2014, the appellant applied for leave to remain outside  the
    Immigration Rules.  Her application was refused on 28 August 2014.  The
    appellant challenged that refusal by means of judicial  review.   On  9
    November 2016, a judicial review application was dismissed on the basis
    that the matter had, by then, become academic. The reason was that  the
    appellant wished to be able to remain in the  United  Kingdom  for  the
    purposes of conducting proceedings against her former employer  in  the
    Employment Tribunal. Those proceedings had in fact  been  concluded  in
    January 2015. We shall have more to say about them in Part G below.

B. THE APPELLANT'S HUMAN RIGHTS CLAIM AND ITS REFUSAL

 5. On 18 April 2018, the appellant made a new  application  for  leave  to
    remain, together with a human rights claim.  On 31  January  2019,  the
    respondent refused the  application/claim.   The  appellant  no  longer
    seeks to rely upon so much of her claim as related to her  relationship
    with a person in the United Kingdom.  As a result, the appellant's case
    rests upon her Article 8 ECHR right to respect for her private life.

 6.  In  determining  the  private  life  aspect,  the  respondent  applied
    paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration Rules.  This provides as follows:-

         "Requirements to be met by an applicant for leave to remain on the
         grounds of private life
         276ADE (1).  The requirements to be met by an applicant  for  leave
         to remain on the grounds of private life in the UK are that at  the
         date of application, the applicant:
         (i)  does not fall for refusal under any of the grounds in  Section
             S-LTR 1.1 to  S-LTR  2.2.  and  S-LTR.3.1.  to  S-LTR.4.5.  in
             Appendix FM; and
         (ii) has made a valid  application  for  leave  to  remain  on  the
             grounds of private life in the UK; and
         (iii)    has lived continuously in the UK for  at  least  20  years
             (discounting any period of imprisonment); or
         (iv) is under the age of 18 years and has lived continuously in the
             UK  for  at  least  7  years  (discounting   any   period   of
             imprisonment) and it would not be  reasonable  to  expect  the
             applicant to leave the UK; or
         (v)  is aged 18 years or above and under 25 years and has spent  at
             least  half  of  his  life  living  continuously  in  the   UK
             (discounting any period of imprisonment); or
         (vi) subject to sub-paragraph (2), is aged 18 years or  above,  has
             lived  continuously  in  the  UK  for  less  than   20   years
             (discounting any period of imprisonment) but  there  would  be
             very significant obstacles to the applicant's integration into
             the country to which he would have to go if required to  leave
             the UK."
 7. At the date of decision, the appellant had lived in the United  Kingdom
    for seven years and six months.   She  therefore  could  not  meet  the
    requirement to have lived continuously in the  United  Kingdom  for  at
    least 20 years.  This meant she failed  to  meet  the  requirements  of
    paragraph 276ADE(1)(iii).

 8. Given that the appellant was over the age of 18, she failed to meet the
    requirements of paragraph 276ADE(1)(iv).  Not being between the ages of
    18 and 25, she also  failed  to  meet  the  requirements  of  paragraph
    276ADE(1)(v).

 9.  Consideration  therefore  moved  to  paragraph   276ADE(1)(vi).    The
    respondent  did  not  accept  that  there  would  be  very  significant
    obstacles to the appellant's integration  into  India.   The  appellant
    stated in her application that she spoke English, Hindi  and  Gujarati,
    all of which were widely spoken in India.   The  respondent  considered
    that this linguistic ability "will help you to adapt to life in  India,
    socially and culturally".

10. The respondent also noted the appellant had stated in  her  application
    form that her parents and siblings remained in India.  She had provided
    no evidence that they would be unable to assist her or accommodate  her
    on her return to that country.  She had lived there up to the age of 21
    years and 9 months, which included the appellant's childhood, formative
    years and a significant portion of her adult life.

11. The respondent  considered  that  the  appellant  would  have  retained
    knowledge of the life, language and culture of India and would not face
    significant obstacles to reintegrating into life in that country.

12. For those reasons, the respondent concluded that  the  appellant  could
    not meet paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi).  The respondent accordingly turned to
    consider, pursuant to GEN.3.2 of Appendix FM to the Immigration  Rules,
    whether there were exceptional circumstances in  the  appellant's  case
    that would render a refusal of leave a breach of Article 8 of the  ECHR
    "because it would result in unjustifiably harsh consequences for you".

13. In determining this issue, the respondent noted that the appellant said
    she no longer had a family home or any form of  support  in  India,  on
    account  of  her  relationship  with  a  Muslim  man  (this  being  the
    relationship which is no longer relied on); that she  would  face  ill-
    treatment from the family of this man if she went to his  own  country;
    that the appellant and her partner would be "outcasts" if  returned  to
    India; that the appellant contributed "to charity in the UK"; and  that
    the appellant had developed a family and private  life  in  the  United
    Kingdom.

14. The respondent concluded that none  of  this  demonstrated  that  there
    would be unjustifiably harsh consequences for the appellant,  were  she
    to return to India.  The respondent noted that the  appellant's  family
    and friends were financially supporting  her  in  the  United  Kingdom.
    Whilst the current economic  situation  in  India  "may  be  poor,  the
    Secretary of State is  satisfied  you  would  not  suffer  any  greater
    hardship than other people of that nation".   As  for  contribution  to
    charities within the United Kingdom, the  respondent  considered  there
    was nothing preventing the appellant returning to India  and  assisting
    her local community and charities in that country.

15. The appellant contended that she had established a private life in  the
    United Kingdom and would find it difficult to  return  to  India.   The
    respondent observed that the appellant would have been fully aware when
    developing any such  private  life  that  she  had  no  expectation  of
    remaining in the United Kingdom indefinitely.

C.  THE APPELLANT'S APPEAL TO THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL

16. The appellant appealed against the refusal of her human  rights  claim.
    Her appeal was heard on 13 August 2019  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Bulpitt.  The appellant was represented by Counsel (not Mr Saini).   In
    a decision promulgated on 30 August 2019, Judge Bulpitt  dismissed  the
    appellant's appeal.

17. Before Judge Bulpitt, the appellant relied upon  the  matter  which  Mr
    Saini, both in the grounds of application for permission to  appeal  to
    the Upper Tribunal and in his skeleton argument for the Upper  Tribunal
    hearing, categorised as a "historic injustice".  This derives from  the
    experience of the appellant as an employee of Bakkavor Foods Limited.

18. Judge Bulpitt recorded the matter as follows  in  paragraph  4  of  his
    decision:-

         "4.  ...

             b)   On 14 October  2010  the  appellant  entered  the  United
                  Kingdom in order to study for a  Masters  Degree  in  Food
                  Science having been granted a student visa which was valid
                  until 15 February 2012.

             c)   On completion of her Masters Degree the appellant  gained
                  employment with Bakkavor Foods Limited as a  specification
                  technologist.  She was granted a highly skilled post study
                  visa, giving her leave to remain  in  the  United  Kingdom
                  until 28 May 2014.

             d)   On 23 May 2014, following a protracted grievance process,
                  Bakkavor Foods finally informed the  appellant  that  they
                  had decided not to  sponsor  her  and  support  a  further
                  extension to her leave to remain in  the  United  Kingdom.
                  They then dismissed the appellant from her employment with
                  effect from 28 May 2014 which was the  day  her  leave  to
                  remain in the United Kingdom expired.

             e)   In June 2014 the appellant commenced  an  action  in  the
                  employment tribunal against Bakkavor  Foods  for  wrongful
                  dismissal  and  discrimination.   On  25  June  2014   the
                  appellant made an application for leave to remain  in  the
                  United Kingdom outside of the immigration rules to  enable
                  her  to  pursue  the  employment   tribunal   case.    The
                  respondent refused that application on 28 August 2014 with
                  no right of appeal.

             f)    The  appellant  sought  a   judicial   review   of   the
                  respondent's decision and on 10 June 2015 she was  granted
                  permission to bring judicial review proceedings  by  Upper
                  Tribunal Judge Gleeson on the basis that it  was  arguable
                  that the respondent had failed to engage  with  the  issue
                  being raised by the appellant when making its August  2014
                  decision  i.e.  whether  discretionary  leave  should   be
                  granted to enable the appellant to  fight  her  Employment
                  Tribunal case.

             g)   On 13 January 2015 the  appellant's  Employment  Tribunal
                  case was concluded with the appellant  being  awarded  one
                  week's pay on the grounds that Bakkavor Foods  were  found
                  to have breached their contract with the appellant by  not
                  paying her for the agreed  notice  period.   The  Tribunal
                  found  that  the  appellant  had  not  been  discriminated
                  against.

             h)   On 9 November 2016 the appellant's judicial review of the
                  respondent's August 2014 decision  was  dismissed  on  the
                  basis  that  it  was  by  that  time  academic  since  the
                  employment tribunal proceedings had concluded.

             i)   On 18 April 2018 the appellant made the  application  for
                  leave to remain in the United Kingdom on the basis of  her
                  private and family life  which  is  the  subject  of  this
                  appeal."

19. At paragraph 5, Judge Bulpitt described the case for the  appellant  as
    follows:-

         "The appellant says she has spent  the  last  five  years  fighting
         against unfair decisions which have had a detrimental effect on her
         and her ability to cope, were she to have to return to India.   The
         appellant also says she has a bad relationship with her  family  in
         India as a result of a relationship she has had with a  Muslim  man
         in the United  Kingdom  which  has  recently  ended.   In  all  the
         circumstances, in view of her  particular  history  and  particular
         challenges in India the appellant says the respondent's decision is
         disproportionate."

20. Judge Bulpitt began his findings at paragraph 11 of his  decision.   He
    noted that the appellant had, at the date  of  hearing,  lived  in  the
    United Kingdom for nearly nine years and the "appellant says that as  a
    result she feels 'at heart a  Londoner'.   In  her  oral  evidence  the
    appellant says she felt she had developed as an  adult  in  the  United
    Kingdom and has developed a sense of freedom  and  independence".   The
    appellant also told Judge Bulpitt that she "has established a brilliant
    group of friends one of whom she lives with rent-free".  Judge  Bulpitt
    noted, however, that little further evidence of the appellant's private
    life was adduced.

21. At paragraph 13, Judge Bulpitt  found  that  it  was  likely  that  the
    appellant had established a number of friendships in the United Kingdom
    over the last nine years; but beyond those there was little evidence of
    further private life.  Accordingly, Judge Bulpitt  concluded  that  the
    appellant "has established only a limited private life  in  the  United
    Kingdom".

22. That private life was, furthermore, established  at  a  time  when  the
    appellant's status in the United Kingdom "was precarious or  unlawful".
    The appellant told the judge that her  intention  when  coming  to  the
    United Kingdom was to obtain a Masters degree and then return to India.
     It was obtaining the job with Bakkavor  Foods  Limited  shortly  after
    completing her Masters that made her change her mind and gave her  hope
    to build a career and life in the United Kingdom.   Whilst  noting  the
    appellant's case that she had been poorly treated by her employers "who
    only communicated the fact that they would not sponsor her to  stay  in
    the United Kingdom at the last moment", Judge Bulpitt observed that the
    appellant had only ever had temporary leave to remain and for the  last
    five years had had no leave to remain at all.

23. At paragraph 15, the judge doubted the appellant's assertion  that  she
    had been in a relationship with a Muslim man.  A letter  said  to  come
    from him gave "no real detail of the relationship"; nor was  there  any
    further evidence  about  it.   Judge  Bulpitt,  accordingly,  found  it
    "unlikely that the appellant did have a relationship with a Muslim  man
    and consequently I find that it is unlikely that  she  has  fallen  out
    with her parents" (paragraph 15).  Even if the judge were  wrong  about
    that, he said that any hostility  had  been  directed  by  the  parents
    towards  the  relationship  and  the  appellant  conceded   in   cross-
    examination that it was likely she would be able to reconcile with  her
    parents if she returned to India (paragraph 16).

24. At paragraph 17, the judge found it likely the appellant  had  retained
    significant links to India.  She had not raised any  medical,  cultural
    or financial reason why integration back into life in  India  would  be
    difficult for her.  Although "it may not be the  appellant's  preferred
    option there would be no significant obstacles to  her  integrating  in
    India" (paragraph 17).

25. Beginning at paragraph 18, Judge Bulpitt addressed in detail the  issue
    of what had happened during the appellant's  employment  with  Bakkavor
    Foods Limited:-

         "18. I have paid careful attention to the treatment  the  appellant
             received from Bakkavor Foods and  the  appellant's  consequent
             grievance which the employment  tribunal  judge  described  as
             understandable.  I recognise that  it  would  have  been  very
             disappointing  not   to   have   been   sponsored   in   these
             circumstances and that the appellant will have felt very upset
             as a  result.   I  do  not  however  consider  that  this  bad
             treatment and the appellant's consequent grievance means  that
             effective immigration control and the Immigration Rules should
             be ignored.  The fact of the matter is that the appellant  has
             not met the requirements of the  Immigration  Rules  for  more
             than five years now.

         19.  In R (on the application of Agyarko and others v Secretary  of
             State for the Home Department (2017) UKSC 11 it was said  that
             when considering a human rights case outside  the  immigration
             rules such as this one: "The critical issue will generally  be
             whether, giving due weight  to  the  strength  of  the  public
             interest in the removal of the person in the case  before  it,
             the article 8 claim is sufficiently strong to outweigh it.  In
             general, in cases concerned with  precarious  family  life,  a
             very strong or compelling claim is required  to  outweigh  the
             public interest in immigration control."

         20.  In this case the public interest in removal of  the  appellant
             is to be given considerable weight because she does  not  meet
             any of the requirements of  the  Immigration  Rules.   Section
             1176B Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 makes clear
             that the maintenance of effective immigration  control  is  in
             the public interest.  The same section also states that little
             weight is to be  given  to  a  private  life  which  has  been
             established whilst a person is in the  United  Kingdom  either
             precariously or unlawfully.  I have found that  the  appellant
             would face few obstacles to integration back  in  India  which
             will of course her original intention [sic].   For  all  these
             reasons the balance weighs heavily towards removal.

         21.  Against those factors in favour of removal are the  fact  that
             the appellant was treated poorly by her employer who  led  her
             to believe that they would sponsor her to remain in the United
             Kingdom but then chose not to do so.  The  appellant  has  now
             lived in the United Kingdom for  approaching  nine  years  and
             during that time has established some strong friendships.

         22.  Weighing these competing factors I find that the appellant has
             not established the very strong or compelling  claim  required
             to outweigh the public interest in immigration  control.   The
             appellant's wish and desire to remain in  the  United  Kingdom
             are not determinative, neither is her grievance (reasonable as
             it has been found to be) at the way she  was  treated  by  her
             employer.  There is a strong public  interest  in  maintaining
             effective immigration control and  as  previously  stated  the
             simple fact is that the appellant has not met the requirements
             of the rules which Parliament has endorsed as reflecting  when
             a person should be granted leave to remain for more than  five
             years.  The [sic] are no particular features  which  make  the
             appellant's claim  particularly  compelling  and  in  all  the
             circumstances  I  find  that  public  interest  outweighs  the
             appellant's  desire  to  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  and
             grievance at not being able to find sponsor which would enable
             her to do so."

D. THE APPELLANT'S APPEAL TO THE UPPER TRIBUNAL

26. In his grounds of permission on  behalf  of  the  appellant,  Mr  Saini
    submitted that the appellant had been unfairly prevented from  applying
    for a visa by Bakkavor Foods Limited and had been left in the  position
    in which she could not apply for further  leave  with  another  Tier  2
    sponsor (or in any other PBS category for which she might be  eligible)
    due to the fact that  the  outcome  of  her  grievance  procedure  with
    Bakkavor Foods Limited became known only on the very last  day  of  her
    extant Tier 2 leave.

27. Ground 1 of Mr Saini's grounds submitted that Judge Bulpitt had  failed
    lawfully to  determine  "the  key  issue  of  whether  there  has  been
    "Historic Injustice" committed by the respondent and  the  consequences
    that flow from that commission in  a  proportionality  assessment.   At
    paragraph 45 of the grounds, Mr Saini set out what he described as "the
    most crucial element of the appellant's witness statement" on the issue
    of historic injustice.  Here, the appellant said:-

         "I have been the victim of judicial scuppering for  the  past  five
         years.  A battle which started out as employment malpractice  by  a
         corporate against their employee has snowballed into  a  series  of
         misjudgements and downfalls against an individual.  The  employment
         tribunal case against the employer was partly successful  with  the
         court acknowledging that I have suffered discrimination however  it
         did not fit within the  realms  of  discrimination  as  defined  by
         employment law, namely racial  and  sexual  discrimination  at  the
         hands of a person from the same race.

         The subsequent Judicial  Review  case  against  the  Home  Office's
         decision to deny Further Leave to Remain to pursue said  employment
         tribunal also concluded with the Home Office accepting that it  had
         essentially made an error in judgement on the initial applications.

         However, since I had already been able to stay in the UK to  pursue
         my tribunal claim, whilst the proceedings of the JR took  place,  I
         had  essentially  received  the  requested  leave  to  remain   and
         considered my claim academic.  This to me a  major  miscarriage  of
         justice in  addition  to  the  trivialization  of  immigration  law
         entirely.

         My application for FLR(O) was made to establish  a  legal  stay  in
         addition to have a recorded  regularised  immigration  status.   By
         acknowledging its misgivings in making the decision but refusing to
         grant any relief claiming the case was  academic  the  Home  Office
         raises concerns on the validity of any immigration laws at all.   A
         government organisation deems the process of paying fees and making
         an application unnecessary by saying that I've already  managed  to
         stay on in this country without a clarified immigration status  and
         that  fulfils  the  purpose.   This  sets  out  a  very   dangerous
         precedent."

         (Emphases supplied in grounds)

28. At paragraph 48 of the grounds, we find this:-

         "48. ... It is also plain that the FTT  has  completely  failed  to
             consider the Respondent's failure to grant  further  leave  to
             the Appellant in the light of that unfair treatment, that  her
             further immigration status for the past 5 years is beyond  her
             control and that she  has  become  a  victim  of  the  hostile
             environment and drowned in consequent debt (see �  14  of  the
             Decision), as well as the Respondent's inaction against a Tier
             2  Sponsor  that  had  unlawfully  discriminated  against   an
             employee and frustrated  that  employee's  attempt  to  obtain
             further lawful leave to remain which is not  in  keeping  with
             the General Sponsor Duties that Tier 2  Sponsor's  must  abide
             by.

         49.   It  is  also  disconcerting  that  despite  the  obvious  and
             conclusive historic unfair treatment received by the Appellant
             the FTT has distilled her complain to a simple statement  that
             it would have been "disappointing" to  not  be  sponsored  and
             that she would have been "very upset"."

29. At paragraph 58 of  the  grounds,  the  appellant  (through  Mr  Saini)
    submitted that the approach of  Judge  Bulpitt  "is  inconsistent  with
    binding authority from the higher Courts as  to  the  correct  approach
    that the FTT should have taken under  Article  8(2)  ECHR  towards  the
    doctrine of 'historic injustice' ...".

30. On  26  February  2020,  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Norton-Taylor  granted
    permission to appeal.  Although he calculated that the application made
    to the First-tier Tribunal for permission had been late, by one day, he
    concluded that, in the interests of justice,  the  application  to  the
    Upper Tribunal should be admitted, notwithstanding the non-admission of
    the late application made to the First-tier Tribunal: see rule 21(7) of
    the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.

31. Upper Tribunal Judge Norton-Taylor considered that the "central thrust"
    of the appellant's grounds was that the appellant had been  subject  to
    "historic injustice" both by her previous Tier 2 sponsor and, in  turn,
    by the respondent.

32. At paragraph 38, the skeleton argument for the hearing  criticises  the
    FTT in the light of that  "obvious  and  inconclusive  historic  unfair
    treatment" for categorising the situation as  "disappointing"  for  the
    appellant who would have been "very upset".  Mr Saini  says  that  this
    "does not grapple with the lawful effect  of  the  historic  injustice"
    that the appellant has suffered.

33. Apart from the issue of historic injustice, Mr Saini  criticises  Judge
    Bulpitt for relying upon the Supreme Court judgment in Agyarko for  the
    proposition that "in general, in cases concerned with precarious family
    life, a very strong or compelling claim is  required  to  outweigh  the
    public interest in immigration control".  By repeating that formulation
    at paragraph 22 of his decision,  Mr  Saini  says  that  Judge  Bulpitt
    wrongly elevated the relevant test.  Mr Saini submits  that  the  words
    "very  compelling",  used  by  Judge  Bulpitt,  indicate  that  he  was
    employing the test of "very compelling circumstances", as  set  out  in
    section 117C(6)  of  the  2002  Act.   That  test  applies  to  foreign
    criminals who are liable to deportation and who,  moreover,  have  been
    sentenced to a period of imprisonment of at least four  years.   It  is
    common ground that the appellant is not liable to deportation.

E. HISTORIC INJUSTICE

34. As we can see from paragraph 1 above, the primary meaning of "historic"
    is something that is famous  or  important  in  history.   By  contrast
    "historical" denotes merely something that concerns history;  in  other
    words, anything that has happened in the past.

35. The caselaw of the higher courts contains  two  instances  of  historic
    injustice, in the true  sense  of  those  words.   The  first  concerns
    citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies, whose rights to settle  in
    the United Kingdom were restricted by the Commonwealth Immigration  Act
    1968.  In December  1973,  the  European  Commission  on  Human  Rights
    decided that the 1968 Act was racially discriminatory.  That led the UK
    government to enter into a "friendly settlement", as a result of  which
    a Special Quota Voucher Scheme  was  introduced  in  order  to  benefit
    citizens of the United Kingdom and  Colonies  whose  rights  have  been
    restricted by the 1968 Act.  The scheme, however, did not assist in the
    case of married women who were not heads of households.   However,  the
    scheme discriminated between men and women on the  grounds  of  marital
    status.  It was abolished in 2002.  In the same year, section 12 of the
    2002 Act amended sections 4 and 14 of the British Nationality Act 1981,
    so as to entitle certain British overseas citizens to be registered  as
    British citizens from 30 April 2003.  On  5  November  2002,  the  Home
    Secretary told the House of Commons that "we  are  talking  here  about
    righting an historical [sic] wrong".

36. This outline of the  historic  wrong  (for  such  it  undoubtedly  was)
    perpetrated by the 1968 Act and the subsequent scheme  comes  from  the
    judgment of Sedley LJ in Patel and Others  v  Entry  Clearance  Officer
    (Mumbai) [2010] EWCA Civ 17.  In that case, the appellant sought family
    reunion in the UK, after  more  than  three  decades  in  which  lawful
    settlement here "was improperly barred".   The  Court  of  Appeal  held
    that, provided the individual concerned had a protected Article 8  ECHR
    right, the effect of the historic injustice was, in effect, to diminish
    the importance otherwise be given to  the  maintenance  of  immigration
    control.  This emerges clearly from paragraphs 13 to 15 of the judgment
    of Sedley LJ.

37. The other uncontestable incidence of historic injustice in the  caselaw
    of the higher courts involved the less favourable treatment accorded to
    Gurkha veterans,  compared  with  Foreign  and  Commonwealth  nationals
    seeking settlement in the United Kingdom on discharge from the  British
    Army.  In R (Gurung v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2013]
    EWCA Civ 8, the Court of Appeal held that this historic  injustice  was
    one of the factors to  be  weighed  in  the  proportionality  balancing
    exercise under Article 8(2), against the need to maintain  a  firm  and
    fair immigration policy.  Lord Dyson MR said:-

         "35. It is accepted  on  behalf  of  the  SSHD  that  the  historic
             injustice is a relevant factor to be taken into  account  when
             the proportionality balancing  exercise  is  undertaken.   The
             question is what weight should  be  given  to  it.   Normally,
             questions of weight are a matter for  the  decision-maker  and
             the court does not intervene except on well-established public
             law grounds.  But the  present  appeals  raise  the  point  of
             principle whether the historic injustice suffered  by  Gurkhas
             should be  accorded  limited  or  substantial  weight  in  the
             article 8(2) balancing exercise.

         36.  The court should be wary in any context of attempting to  give
             prescriptive  guidance  as  to  the  weight  to  be  given  to
             particular factors when the article 8(2) balancing exercise is
             performed, and certainly in  the  context  of  an  immigration
             decision.  In Huang v Home Secretary [2007] UKHL 11, [2007]  2
             AC 167, the House of  Lords  was  careful  not  to  be  overly
             prescriptive.  It said at para 16:


                  "The authority will wish to consider and  weigh  all  that
                  tells  in  favour  of  the  refusal  of  leave  which   is
                  challenged, with  particular  reference  to  justification
                  under article 8(2).  There will, in almost  any  case,  be
                  certain  general  considerations  to  bear  in  mind:  the
                  general  administrative  desirability  of  applying  known
                  rules  if  a  system  of  immigration  control  is  to  be
                  workable, predictable, consistent and fair as between  one
                  applicant and another; the damage to  good  administration
                  and  effective  control  if  a  system  is  perceived   by
                  applicants   internationally   to   be   unduly    porous,
                  unpredictable or perfunctory; the need to discourage  non-
                  nationals  admitted  to  the  country   temporarily   from
                  believing that they can commit serious crimes and  yet  be
                  allowed to remain; the need to discourage fraud, deception
                  and deliberate breaches of the law; and so on."


         37.  These wise words were carefully chosen.  The language of  "the
             authority will wish to consider" and "there  will  be  certain
             general considerations  to  bear  in  mind"  is  measured  and
             cautious.  We also bear in mind the warning  sounded  by  Lord
             Bingham in EB (Kosovo) v Home Secretary [2008] UKHL 41, [2009]
             1 AC 1159 at para 12:


                  "...there is in general no alternative to making a careful
                  and informed evaluation of the  facts  of  the  particular
                  case.  The search for a hard-edged or bright-line rule  to
                  be applied to the generality of cases is incompatible with
                  the  difficult  evaluative  exercise   which   article   8
                  requires."


         38.  We accept the submission  of  Ms  McGahey  that  the  historic
             injustice is only one of the factors to be weighed against the
             need to maintain a firm and fair immigration  policy.   It  is
             not necessarily determinative.  If it were, the application of
             every adult child of a UK-settled Gurkha who establishes  that
             he has a family  life  with  his  parent  would  be  bound  to
             succeed.   Mr  Drabble  does  not  contend  for  this  extreme
             position and it is not supported by the  approach  adopted  in
             the BOC cases to which we have referred.


         39.  Ms McGahey submits that the BOC cases should be  distinguished
             from the Gurkha cases for three reasons: (i) the  BOC  parents
             who  suffered  historical  injustice  were  British  citizens,
             whereas Gurkhas are nationals of Nepal (it is a  condition  of
             their service that they remain  Nepalese  citizens  throughout
             their service in the British Army); (ii) the BOC  parents  had
             (or should have had) an absolute and  indefeasible  right,  as
             British citizens, to settle in the  UK,  whereas  Gurkhas  are
             required to apply to settle  here;  and  (iii)  the  injustice
             suffered by the BOC parents was particularly grave,  involving
             racially and then sexually  discriminatory  schemes  to  their
             detriment, whereas no equivalent injustice has  been  suffered
             by the Gurkhas.


         40.  We accept that there are differences between the  position  of
             Gurkhas and that of BOCs.  The first two  points  made  by  Ms
             McGahey amount to the same thing: as  British  citizens,  BOCs
             have the indefeasible right  to  settle  in  the  UK,  whereas
             Gurkhas, as citizens of Nepal, will "normally" be  allowed  to
             settle here, but not if there is  "adverse  information  of  a
             serious nature" about them. Like Sedley LJ, we  recognise  the
             existence of this difference  between  the  two  groups.   The
             position of Gurkhas is less secure than  that  of  BOCs.   But
             unless there is some evidence to suggest that there is a  real
             risk that (i) the Gurkha's adult dependant child  may  not  be
             given leave to enter, for example, because  there  is  adverse
             information of a serious  nature  about  him,  or  (ii)  leave
             granted to the Gurkha or his child may  be  abrogated  in  the
             future, the difference between the two groups should be  given
             little weight.


         41.  We do not consider that a judgment about the egregiousness  of
             the injustice that was suffered by  the  Gurkhas  as  compared
             with that suffered by the BOCs should be a relevant factor  in
             the balancing exercise.  As submitted on behalf of NR, Ghising
             and KR, the crucial  point  is  that  there  was  an  historic
             injustice in both cases, the consequence  of  which  was  that
             members of both groups were prevented from settling in the UK.
              That is why the  historic  injustice  is  such  an  important
             factor to be taken into account in the balancing exercise  and
             why the applicant dependant child of a Gurkha who  is  settled
             in the UK has such a strong claim to  have  his  article  8(1)
             right  vindicated,  notwithstanding   the   potency   of   the
             countervailing public interest in the maintaining  of  a  firm
             immigration  policy.  There  is  no  place  in  the  balancing
             exercise for making fine judgments as to whether one injustice
             is more immoral or worthy of condemnation than  another.  Such
             judgments (which would in any event be difficult to weigh) may
             be relevant in the political plane.  They are not relevant  to
             the making of decisions as to whether it is  proportionate  to
             interfere with an individual's article 8(1) rights."


         42.  It follows that we do not accept the submission of Mr  Drabble
             that the weight to be given to the historic injustice  in  the
             Gurkha cases is just as strong as the weight to  be  given  to
             the injustice caused to the BOCs.  The fact that the right  to
             settle enjoyed by Gurkhas is less secure than that enjoyed  by
             the BOCs is a relevant factor.  But it also follows that we do
             not agree with the UT that the weight to be given is generally
             "substantially less" in the Gurkha cases.   If  a  Gurkha  can
             show that, but for  the  historic  injustice,  he  would  have
             settled in the UK at a time when  his  dependant  (now)  adult
             child would have been able to accompany  him  as  a  dependant
             child under the age of 18, that is a strong reason for holding
             that it is proportionate to permit the adult child to join his
             family now. To that extent,  the  Gurkha  and  BOC  cases  are
             similar.  That is why we cannot agree that, as a general rule,
             the weight accorded to the injustice should  be  substantially
             different in the two cases."

38. Despite the observations in Gurung, emphasising the  limitations  there
    might  be  upon  any  general  judicial  pronouncement  regarding   the
    significance of the part to be played  by  historic  injustice,  in  AP
    (India) v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2015]  EWCA  Civ
    89, Elias LJ  noted  that  the  Secretary  of  State  had  subsequently
    accepted that, if the only factor weighing on the government's side  of
    the balance was  the  importance  of  maintaining  a  firm  immigration
    policy, the historic injustice in the BOC and  Gurkha  cases  will,  in
    fact, be decisive.  In other words, provided that a protected family or
    private life exists, the historic injustice robs the government's  side
    of the balance of all weight, thereby effectively guaranteeing  success
    for the individual:-

          "21.    In R (on the application of Gurung) v Secretary  of  State
             for the Home Department [2013] EWCA Civ 8, the Court of Appeal
             was faced with a similar, if not quite so  culpable,  historic
             injustice perpetrated on those who had been  veterans  of  the
             Gurkha brigade and had served in the British army.  The Master
             of the Rolls, Lord Dyson, referred to Sedley LJ's comments  in
             paragraph  15  of  Patel  to  the  effect  that  the  historic
             injustice may perhaps be decisive, but he emphasised the  word
             "perhaps".  Consistently with  that  observation,  Lord  Dyson
             added (para.38) that any historic injustice was  only  one  of
             the factors to be weighed against the need to maintain a  firm
             and fair immigration policy.  However, later in  his  judgment
             he emphasised the considerable weight which should be afforded
             to that factor where it is applicable (para.42):


                  "... If a Gurkha can  show  that,  but  for  the  historic
                  injustice, he would have settled in the UK at a time  when
                  his dependant (now adult) child would have  been  able  to
                  accompany him as a dependant child under the  age  of  18,
                  that  is  a  strong  reason  for  holding   that   it   is
                  proportionate to permit the adult child to join his family
                  now."
    He noted that this principle would apply whether the historic injustice
    was to the Gurkhas or the British citizens from East Africa.
         "22. More recently the Upper Tribunal in R (Ghising) v Secretary of
             State  for  the  Home  Department  [2013]   UKUT   00567   has
             interpreted these decisions as  saying  that  where  the  only
             justification for refusing entry is in order to maintain  firm
             immigration  policy,  the  historic  injustice  should  always
             outweigh that consideration.   Accordingly,  entry  should  be
             granted as a matter of course in such cases.  It  is  only  if
             there is some other factor weighing in favour of refusal, such
             as the commission of criminal offences or  a  bad  immigration
             record, that it will not be decisive.


         23.  Ms McGahey very properly informed us that on  5  January  this
             year the Immigration  Directorate  issued  instructions  which
             have accepted the analysis in Ghising for  Gurkha  cases;  and
             the Secretary of State further accepts that no different  rule
             can be applied to BOC cases.  Accordingly, Ms McGahey  accepts
             that if the appellant had been able to  demonstrate  that  but
             for the historic injustice, his father would have  settled  in
             the UK earlier, with the consequence that the appellant  would
             have sought entry as a minor rather  than  as  an  adult,  his
             appeal ought to have succeeded.  Her case is that he failed to
             establish the causal connection which  was  critical  to  this
             part of his application."

39. What characterises the BOC and Gurkha cases is that  they  involve  the
    belated recognition by the United Kingdom government that a  particular
    class of persons was wrongly treated,  in  immigration  terms,  in  the
    past; and that this injustice should  be  recognised  in  dealing  with
    relevant applications made now.  The injustice does not mean  that  the
    clock is somehow turned back.  The  person  concerned  still  needs  to
    bring themselves within the ambit of Article 8 ECHR, so as  to  require
    the Secretary of State to justify her  interference  with  that  right.
    However, once that point is reached, and the proportionality scales are
    set, the historic injustice operates so as to preclude the Secretary of
    State  from  requiring  that  any  material  weight  be  given  to  the
    importance of maintaining firm immigration controls.

40. The BOC and Gurkha cases are the only examples from the  higher  courts
    so far encountered in the immigration field of  what  may  properly  be
    described as "historic injustice". The category of  historic  injustice
    is, however, not fixed. We may in due course see other cases,  such  as
    those concerned with "Windrush" issues.

41. We consider that, for the future, the expression  "historic  injustice"
    should be reserved for  the  types  of  case  just  described.  It  has
    particular characteristics. The fact that the injustice exists will  be
    uncontroversial. It will be generally recognised.  It will apply  to  a
    particular class of persons. Unlike the classes of  case  to  which  we
    next turn, the operation of historic injustice in the immigration field
    will not depend upon the particular interaction between the  individual
    member of the class and the Secretary of State. The effects of historic
    injustice on the immigration position of the individual are  likely  to
    be profound, even determinative of  success,  provided  that  there  is
    nothing materially adverse in their immigration history.

F. HISTORICAL INJUSTICE

42. By contrast, there  are  cases  that  may  be  described  as  involving
    "historical injustice".  These are where the individual has suffered as
    the  result  of  the  wrongful  operation  (or  non-operation)  by  the
    respondent of her immigration functions.

43. One instance of this is where the respondent  has  failed  to  give  an
    individual the  benefit  of  a  relevant  immigration  policy.  A  good
    overview of the cases concerning this particular category can be  found
    in SL (Vietnam) v Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department  [2010]
    EWCA Civ 225. Jackson LJ (with whom  Ward  LJ  agreed)  held  that  the
    failure of the respondent to apply the then existing "Minors Policy" to
    the appellant, bringing with it the possible entitlement to exceptional
    leave to remain, was a factor that the  respondent  should  have  taken
    into account in deciding whether to exercise discretion  under  section
    3(5)(a)  of  the  Immigration  Act  1971,  and  paragraph  364  of  the
    Immigration Rules, to deport the appellant.

44. In so finding, the Court of Appeal looked at the following cases,  from
    the first decade of the present century:-

         "28. Before addressing the grounds of appeal, I must  first  review
             the relevant law.


                               Part 4. The Law


         29.  In  AA  (Afghanistan)  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
             Department [2007] EWCA  Civ  12  the  adjudicator  hearing  an
             appeal from the Secretary of State's decision overlooked  AA's
             entitlement to ELR as an unaccompanied minor.   The  Secretary
             of State contended that no prejudice had been caused,  because
             AA was aged 17 years and 2 months.  So ELR,  if  given,  would
             have expired ten months later and AA had no entitlement to any
             extension of leave to remain.  The Court of  Appeal,  allowing
             AA's appeal, rejected the Secretary  of  State's  contentions.
             Keene LJ, giving the leading judgment, said this:


                  "22. I recognize the importance to be attached to the loss
                      of  the  potential  right  to  an  in-country  appeal
                      against any refusal of variation of leave to  remain.
                      It is  true  that  the  chances  of  such  an  appeal
                      eventually meeting with success may have  been  slim:
                      on this I see the force of  the  points  made  by  Mr
                      Waite about the substantive merits of such an appeal.
                       Nonetheless, it is to be borne in mind that such  an
                      appeal process would have afforded the applicant  the
                      advantage of an independent judicial consideration of
                      those merits as they stood at the time.   That  is  a
                      significant  advantage   when   compared   with   the
                      arguments which could be put forward  on  a  judicial
                      review of a decision by the Secretary of  State  that
                      no  new  asylum  or  human  rights  claim  had   been
                      advanced.  The  appellant  has  lost  that  advantage
                      because of the errors of law by the  adjudicator  and
                      the AIT.


                  23.  He cannot, of course, now be restored to the position
                      he  would  have  been  in,  had   he   been   granted
                      discretionary  leave  to  remain   until   his   18th
                      birthday. Mr Waite is right to emphasise  that.   But
                      the loss  which  the  appellant  has  suffered  is  a
                      consideration which the  Secretary  of  State  should
                      consider in the exercise  of  his  discretion  as  to
                      whether the  appellant  should  now  be  granted  any
                      further leave to remain and, if so, for how long.


                  24.  The same seems to me to be true of another disbenefit
                      suffered by the appellant as a result of  the  errors
                      of law.  In written submissions accepted by the court
                      after the close of oral argument, the intervener  has
                      made the point that  if  the  appellant  had  enjoyed
                      discretionary  leave  to  remain   until   his   18th
                      birthday, any application by  him  made  before  that
                      leave expired to extend it would have resulted in  an
                      automatic extension of leave  until  the  application
                      (and any consequential appeal) had  been  decided  or
                      withdrawn.  That is the consequence of  section  3(c)
                      of  the  Immigration  Act  1971.    Moreover,   while
                      lawfully in this country because of such an automatic
                      extension of leave, he would have  been  entitled  to
                      work and to obtain various forms of assistance  under
                      the Children Act 1989.  Neither of those benefits  is
                      available to an overstayer.


                  25.  Legally the propositions seem  to  me  to  be  sound.
                      Once again, the appellant  cannot  now  obtain  these
                      benefits as of right: as is said  on  behalf  of  the
                      Secretary  of  State,  this  court  cannot  put   the
                      appellant into the position in which  he  would  have
                      been, had discretionary  leave  been  granted.   But,
                      again, there can be no doubt that he has  suffered  a
                      disbenefit as a result of the legal  errors  made  in
                      this case, and that is something which the  Secretary
                      of State ought now to take into account."


         30.  In EB (Kosovo) v Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department
             [2008] UKHL 41; [2009] 1 AC 1159 the House  of  Lords  had  to
             consider the effect of excessive delay  in  dealing  with  the
             asylum claim of a  young  Kosovar.   Lord  Bingham  identified
             three ways in which the delay was relevant.  At  paragraph  16
             he dealt with the third way in which delay might be  relevant.
             He said:


                  "Delay may be relevant, thirdly, in  reducing  the  weight
                  otherwise to be accorded to the requirements of  firm  and
                  fair immigration control, if the delay is shown to be  the
                  result   of   a   dysfunctional   system   which   yields,
                  unpredictable, inconsistent and unfair outcomes."


         31.  In R (S, H, Q) v Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department
             [2009] EWCA Civ 334 the Court of Appeal  held  that  when  the
             Secretary of State was exercising her discretion as to whether
             to grant ILR, she ought to have regard  to  past  failures  to
             apply a relevant policy. In particular, she should have regard
             to  "the  correction  of  injustice  caused  by  the  previous
             unlawful failure to apply the policy".


         32.  In HH(Iraq) v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department
             [2009] EWCA Civ 727 the Secretary of State made a decision  to
             deport HH following his conviction for three sexual  offences.
             In making that decision the Secretary of State overlooked  his
             policy that persons should not be deported to war  zones.   By
             the time the  case  reached  the  AIT  that  policy  had  been
             withdrawn.  Nevertheless, the AIT held  that  such  withdrawal
             could not retrospectively validate the  Secretary  of  State's
             decision.  The matter should be remitted to the  Secretary  of
             State for a fresh decision.  The Court of Appeal  upheld  that
             decision of the AIT.


         33.   A  number  of  propositions  may  be   derived   from   those
             authorities, including the following:
             i)   A decision may be unlawful if it is reached in  disregard
                  of a relevant policy.
             ii)  Past prejudice suffered in consequence of such a decision
                  may be a relevant factor to take into account,  even  when
                  that policy has ceased to be applicable."
45. It is important to point out that, in some of these cases, including SL
    (Vietnam) itself, the court was not directly concerned with the  effect
    of the respondent's failure on the Article 8 proportionality  exercise.
    The general point made in the cases is nevertheless  relevant  to  that
    exercise. Furthermore, EB (Kosovo) is a case that  expressly  concerned
    proportionality, as the quotation from paragraph 16 of  Lord  Bingham's
    opinion makes plain.

46. Apart from failure to give  the  benefit  of  a  policy  and  delay  in
    reaching a decision, another form of what might  be  called  historical
    injustice may be said to arise, where  the  respondent   forms  a  view
    about an individual's  activities  or  behaviour,  which  leads  to  an
    adverse immigration decision; but where the respondent's view turns out
    to be factually mistaken.  The Court of Appeal examined cases  of  this
    kind in Ahsan v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2017]  EWCA
    Civ 2009, where Underhill LJ  had this to say:-

         "120.    The starting-point is that it seems to me clear that if on
             a human rights appeal an appellant  were  found  not  to  have
             cheated, which inevitably means that the section  10  decision
             had been wrong, the Secretary of State  would  be  obliged  to
             deal with him or her thereafter so far as possible as if  that
             error had not been made, i.e. as if their leave to remain  had
             not been invalidated.  In a straightforward case, for example,
             she could and should make a fresh grant  of  leave  to  remain
             equivalent to that which  had  been  invalidated.   She  could
             also, and  other  things  being  equal  should,  exercise  any
             relevant future discretion, if necessary "outside the  Rules",
             on the basis that the appellant  had  in  fact  had  leave  to
             remain in the relevant period  notwithstanding  that  formally
             that leave  remained  invalidated.   (I  accept  that  how  to
             exercise such a discretion would not always be easy, since  it
             is not always possible to reconstruct the world  as  it  would
             have been; but that problem would arise even if  the  decision
             were quashed on judicial review.)  If it were  clear  that  in
             those  ways  the  successful  appellant  could   be   put   in
             substantially the same position as if the section 10  decision
             had been quashed, I can see no reason in  principle  why  that
             should not be taken into account in deciding whether  a  human
             rights appeal  would  constitute  an  appropriate  alternative
             remedy.  To pick up a particular point relied on by Mr  Biggs,
             I do not regard the fact that  a  person  commits  a  criminal
             offence by remaining in the UK from (apparently) the moment of
             service of a section 10 notice as constituting  a  substantial
             detriment such that he is absolutely entitled to seek to  have
             the notice quashed, at least in circumstances where there  has
             been  no  prosecution.   (It  is  also  irrelevant  that   the
             appellant may have suffered collateral consequences  from  the
             section 10 decision on the basis that his  or  her  leave  has
             been invalidated, such as losing their  job;  past  damage  of
             that  kind  cannot  alas  be  remedied  by  either   kind   of
             proceeding.)
         121. So far so good, but the law in this area is  very  complicated
             and I am not confident that all its ramifications  were  fully
             explored before us.  I do  not  feel  in  a  position  to  say
             definitively that the Secretary of State will always  be  able
             to exercise her discretion, in the aftermath of  a  successful
             human rights appeal, so as to  achieve  the  same  substantive
             result as the formal quashing  of  the  section  10  decision.
             There may,  for  example,  be  legislation  (i.e.  primary  or
             secondary legislation rather  than  simply  the  Rules)  which
             would result in the appellant having to be differently treated
             depending on whether he or she had leave to  remain  during  a
             particular period.  If there were any real doubt about whether
             in a given case a successful human rights appeal would  be  as
             effective as the formal quashing of the  section  10  decision
             the applicant should have the benefit of  that  doubt  and  be
             permitted to pursue judicial review proceedings."
47. Although not immediately apparent,  one  way  in  which  this  kind  of
    erroneous treatment of an individual can have a bearing  on  Article  8
    proportionality is in an ensuing human rights appeal, as was  envisaged
    by Underhill LJ. In such an appeal, the individual  would  be  able  to
    argue that, if the respondent had not formed the mistaken view of their
    conduct, he or she would have been given leave to remain; and that this
    should be given weight in the balancing exercise, comparably  with  how
    the Court of Appeal, in AA (Afghanistan) etc, spoke of  the  respondent
    taking account  of  past  mistakes  in  deciding  whether  to  exercise
    discretion in the individual's favour.

48. Finally, we reiterate the point about terminology made in paragraph  41
    above. Although labels can sometimes be helpful, they can also  obscure
    the true issues in play.  There is nothing inherently "historic"  about
    the respondent's failure  to  give  an  individual  the  benefit  of  a
    particular immigration policy, however important that failure may be to
    the individual concerned. The same is true of gross delay in reaching a
    decision and in making an assessment about an individual's conduct that
    turns out to be incorrect. Each of these failings may have an effect on
    the individual's Article 8 case. But, as can be seen, the ways in which
    this may happen differ from the true "historic injustice" category.

G. THE EMPLOYMENT TRIBUNAL PROCEEDINGS

49. With this in mind, we turn to the details of the appellant's  claim  to
    have suffered a historic injustice  at  the  hands  of  Bakkavor  Foods
    Limited and/or the respondent.  The judgment of the Employment Tribunal
    of 13 January 2015 begins by setting out  the  Tribunal's  conclusions.
    The appellant's claims of sex and race  discrimination  "fail  and  are
    dismissed".  The claim  for  breach  of  contract  "succeeds.   She  is
    entitled to one week's net  pay  of  �357".   The  appellant  was  also
    "entitled to her fees of �1,200".

50.  The  Tribunal's  reasons  for  those  conclusions  record  that  at  a
    preliminary hearing in September 2014,  a  number  of  the  appellant's
    discrimination complaints were dismissed as being both out-of-time  and
    as having no reasonable prospects of success.  The remaining  complaint
    was of  direct  discrimination  under  the  heading  of  sex  and  race
    discrimination.  This involved the allegation that the  company  failed
    to sponsor the  renewal  of  the  appellant's  visa  when  it  expired.
    However, the appellant told the Tribunal  that  she  was  not  in  fact
    alleging that her dismissal was discriminatory  or,  indeed,  that  the
    failure to sponsor her was discriminatory "but rather that she had been
    promised sponsorship and that promise had not been kept because she was
    a woman of Indian origin".

51. At paragraph 12 of the judgment, the Tribunal recorded the  appellant's
    evidence, which was that she had been told  by  Mr  Brar  (who  was  to
    become her line manager) at her initial interview in January 2014  that
    "sponsorship following the expiry of her visa 'shouldn't be  a  problem
    for the right candidate'".  That utterance was, apparently, disputed by
    Mr Brar, although he did not give evidence to the Tribunal.

52. At  paragraph  14,  the  Tribunal  was  satisfied  that  the  appellant
    "believed that she would have a case for  sponsorship  subject  to  her
    satisfactory  performance  in  the  role".   After  being  offered  the
    position, the appellant chased Mr Brar for a review at the end  of  her
    six month probationary period, but this did not take place.

53. In January 2014, the appellant said Mr Brar had  asked  her  about  her
    visa expiry  and  the  possibility  of  an  extension.   She  said  she
    understood that, following what she believed she had been told  at  her
    interview, sponsorship should not be a problem.  Although it  was  said
    Mr Brar was going to investigate  the  matter  further,  there  was  no
    evidence before the Tribunal as to whether or not he did so.  What  was
    clear to the Tribunal, however, was that by this stage  (January  2014)
    the appellant was aware that there was a  potential  problem  with  her
    sponsorship  by  the  company.   On  20  January  2014,  the  appellant
    submitted a written grievance.  The appellant apparently felt  she  had
    been cheated and deceived into accepting the role with the company when
    she could have been actively seeking  a  role  elsewhere  with  greater
    sponsorship prospects.

54. A grievance hearing took place on 31 January 2014.  It appears that  on
    this occasion it was  stated  incorrectly  that  the  company  did  not
    sponsor anyone.  It further appears that  at  this  point  the  company
    advised the appellant that responsibility for securing  her  work  visa
    lay with her and not with the company.

55. On 16 February 2014, the appellant wrote to an MP to complain about the
    matter and on 17 February 2014 she  appealed  the  grievance  decision.
    Her main contention was that she had been misled at interview.  It  was
    not suggested this was  because  of  her  nationality  and/or  sex.   A
    grievance appeal meeting was held on 19 February with  Mr  Brar's  line
    manager.   There  was  no  evidence  of  any  investigation  into   the
    allegations.  The appellant was "merely referenced  to  the  number  of
    training opportunities for managers".  The MP wrote to the  company  in
    March 2014 and this  letter  was  passed  to  the  company's  group  HR
    director.

56. Nothing then happened until 6 May 2014, when the company replied to the
    MP.  For the first time, the appellant learned there was a third  stage
    to the  grievance  procedure.   The  letter  to  the  MP  of  May  2014
    acknowledged that the company could and did sponsor  persons  but  that
    they would not do so in the case of the  appellant.   This  information
    was communicated less than three weeks before the appellant's visa  was
    due to expire.

57. On 9 May, the appellant was offered a third  stage  grievance  meeting,
    which took place on 16 May.  It was chaired by the new factory manager.
     At this point the company's attention was on finding whether there was
    any way to sponsor the appellant following the expiry of her visa.  The
    representatives at the third stage grievance meeting  did  not  re-open
    the other aspects of the appellant's grievance.

58. Having researched the possibility of sponsorship,  it  was  ascertained
    that the company would need to establish that the  employee  was  doing
    the job at the relevant level for  a  Tier  2  sponsorship.   This  was
    equivalent to an NQF level 6 job and also  classified  as  one  of  the
    SOC2010 occupations as set out in the UK Visa and Immigration  Code  of
    Practice for Skilled Workers.  The role of food technologist was listed
    in Code 2129.

59. At paragraph 38 of the judgment, the Tribunal noted  that  the  minimum
    salary required for sponsorship was set at a level  of  �24,300.   From
    the commencement of her employment,  the  appellant  had  been  earning
    �22,000 "albeit [she] had been under  the  impression  that  she  would
    receive a pay review at the same time as her probationary review, which
    had not happened".

60.  The  Tribunal  understood  that  the  company  had  sponsored  another
    technologist but this person had been earning �32,000 and therefore met
    the eligibility requirements.  That employee was an Indian female.

61. Conversely, at paragraph 44, the Tribunal heard that  the  company  had
    refused to sponsor an employee, who, like the appellant, was  initially
    employed when on a Tier 1 (Post-Study)  visa.   This  person  had  been
    earning �23,000 and, like the appellant, was told he did not  meet  the
    minimum salary level.  This led the Tribunal to say:-

         "This suggests that the  claimant's  beliefs  about  the  potential
         influence of Mr Brar or the likelihood of the company giving a  pay
         rise simply to ensure the criteria  were  met  were  likely  to  be
         unfounded."

62. At paragraph 45, the Tribunal noted the appellant's evidence  that  she
    had initially been advised by the UK Border  Agency  that  the  minimum
    salary requirement was �20,500 but she accepted subsequently  that  she
    had been wrongly informed.  The Tribunal concluded that  the  only  way
    the company could sponsor the appellant would have been to  have  given
    her a pay rise of a little over 10%; but the company was not willing to
    do so.  There was at least some evidence that the  appellant  had  been
    given some assurance and there were clearly failures with regard to her
    probationary review, in the Tribunal's view.  The same was true of  the
    early stages of the grievance process.  The  Tribunal  considered  that
    this might have led some employers to make an exception and to  support
    the appellant, who was "understandably aggrieved".  There was, however,
    no evidence that a pay rise would have been given to anyone not showing
    the same protected characteristics as the appellant.

63. After the outcome of the grievance procedure, the appellant  sought  to
    complain to  the  chief  executive  officer  of  the  company  but  her
    complaint was rejected at about 3pm on 28 May 2014, "the  last  day  of
    the claimant's working visa" (paragraph 53).  On 29 May she was advised
    that the company would be ending her employment.  This was communicated
    by a letter dated 30 May 2014.  The appellant said she did  not  appeal
    against that decision because she did not receive the letter.

64. The Tribunal concluded that the appellant  had  been  entitled  to  one
    week's notice, which she did not receive.

65. At paragraph 67, the Tribunal found that  the  appellant's  claim  "was
    that she had been misled at interview with regard to the likelihood  of
    sponsorship" but she "expressly confirmed that  she  was  not  alleging
    that the dismissal nor the  failure  to  sponsor  her  was  an  act  of
    discrimination".

66. At paragraph 69, the Tribunal found that the  appellant  may  not  have
    been aware that she had been misled until  shortly  before  7  January,
    when she stated  in  an  email  that  while  she  had  been  told  that
    sponsorship should not be a problem, she now understood that  this  was
    not the case.

67. At paragraph 74, the Tribunal noted the appellant's main  argument  was
    that her manager, an Indian man, treated Indian women  less  favourably
    but not Indians or women generally.  At paragraph 75, the Tribunal  was
    "not satisfied that [the appellant] was able to  establish  facts  from
    which  we  could  have  concluded  that  discrimination  had   occurred
    notwithstanding the absence of Mr Brar giving evidence".

68. At paragraph 76, the Tribunal  noted  the  appellant's  case  that  she
    considered the reason Mr Brar gave her a false hope "was because of the
    difficulties the [company] was having recruiting.  This would appear to
    suggest that it was a non-discriminatory reason and Mr Brar would  have
    done the same whether she was Indian or not and whether she was  female
    or not".

69. At  paragraph  77,  the  Tribunal  recorded  the  appellant  as  having
    "accepted that Mr Brar had no authority to either award her a pay  rise
    or to sponsor her".  At paragraph 80, the Tribunal said:-

         "80.  Accordingly,  notwithstanding   the   [appellant's]   feeling
             understandably aggrieved by any assurances  she  believed  she
             had been given not being kept and  further  aggrieved  by  the
             handling of her grievances  and  the  misinformation  provided
             therein, unreasonable treatment cannot of itself  lead  to  an
             inference of discrimination and there was no  evidence  before
             us that could.

         81.  Accordingly, the [appellant's] claims of  discrimination,  the
             underlying circumstances of which may have  disadvantaged  her
             in seeking work and sponsorship opportunities elsewhere,  must
             nonetheless fail."

70. The judgment concluded by noting that the  claim  for  notice  pay  was
    upheld, which meant that she was awarded the full fees for the  hearing
    and bringing the claim.

H. DISCUSSION

71. It is, in our view, manifest that  the  appellant  cannot  successfully
    contend that she had suffered  "historic  injustice".   She  is  not  a
    person of a class that has been affected by what is now  recognised  by
    the United Kingdom government as unfair or unjust  treatment,  such  as
    that suffered by the families of those denied citizenship in  the  late
    1960s; or by  the  families  of  ex-Gurkha  servicemen.   Nor  can  the
    appellant show she has been subjected to "historical injustice", in any
    of the ways we have  described.  The  appellant  cannot  point  to  any
    beneficial policy of the respondent, which has been wrongly withheld in
    her case; nor has the respondent reached an erroneous decision that the
    appellant is no longer entitled to leave because of  some  misbehaviour
    on her part.  The appellant  has  been  without  leave  to  remain  for
    several years.

72. The circumstances in which the appellant came to find  herself  without
    leave were considered in detail by  the  Employment  Tribunal.   It  is
    regrettable that the appellant has seen fit to describe herself as "the
    victim of judicial scuppering for the past five years"  and  that  this
    found its way into the grounds of application for permission to appeal.
     There is no suggestion of any  erroneous  judicial  behaviour  of  any
    kind.

73. It is also plainly  untrue  that  the  Employment  Tribunal  found  the
    appellant had suffered discrimination.  The Tribunal expressly held  to
    the contrary.  The most that can be inferred in the appellant's  favour
    from  the  Employment  Tribunal's  judgment,  is  that  Mr  Brar  -  an
    individual whom she acknowledges had no authority to award  her  a  pay
    rise or to sponsor her - may, at the beginning of her employment,  have
    given the appellant a misleading impression about whether she might  be
    sponsored by the company at the  end  of  the  initial  period  of  her
    working visa.

74. The real issue in this  case,  which  Mr  Saini  acknowledged  in  oral
    submissions, is whether - even though the matter is not one of historic
    or  historical  injustice  -  the   First-tier   Tribunal   Judge   was
    nevertheless required to reduce the importance that would otherwise  be
    given to immigration control, because of  the  appellant's  experiences
    with Bakkavor Foods Limited.   As  we  have  seen,  Judge  Bulpitt  had
    express regard to the  appellant's  employment  history  and  what  had
    transpired when she was with the  company.   Judge  Bulpitt  concluded,
    however, that the  fact  the  appellant  "was  treated  poorly  by  her
    employer" did not diminish the public interest in immigration  control.



75. Mr Saini has been unable to point to any authority  or  principle  that
    shows Judge Bulpitt erred in law in refusing to reduce the weight to be
    given  to  immigration   control,   notwithstanding   the   appellant's
    employment history. This is unsurprising.  Those who come to the United
    Kingdom for the purpose of study or employment may - like anyone else -
    experience difficulties and disappointment of various kinds.  Not every
    teaching institution will  be  of  the  highest  standard.   Not  every
    employer will be ideal.  In the present case, Mr Brar may have  "talked
    up" the appellant's prospect  of  being  able  to  proceed  to  further
    sponsorship, when she was taken  on  by  the  company.   However,  from
    January 2014, the appellant was, by her own admission, aware that there
    were problems with what  Mr  Brar  is  said  to  have  told  her.   The
    appellant decided to engage in protracted grievance  procedures.   That
    was her choice.  So too was her decision to bring  proceedings  against
    the company in the Employment Tribunal, where all that she succeeded in
    obtaining was one week's pay in lieu of notice and  the  costs  of  the
    claim.  She failed in respect of her  claims  based  on  discrimination
    including, importantly, that involving direct discrimination on grounds
    of race/gender.

76. Our attention has not been drawn to  any  evidence  to  show  that  the
    appellant sought to obtain sponsorship from another employer, from  the
    point in January 2014 when she realised there  were  difficulties  with
    the company keeping her on, following the expiry of her visa.  Nor  has
    our attention been drawn to any evidence that the appellant  sought  at
    that time to bring her difficulties to the attention of the respondent.

77. As a result, there is no merit in the  submission  that  the  appellant
    found herself without leave to  remain,  solely  as  a  result  of  the
    misfeasance of Bakkavor Foods Limited.  But, even if the position  were
    otherwise, the appellant still faces the  difficulty  of  showing  that
    Judge Bulpitt was simply not entitled, in making his own assessment  of
    how the proportionality balance should be struck under Article 8(2), to
    conclude that the appellant's experiences did  not  demand  a  material
    reduction to be made in the weight to be given  to  the  importance  of
    immigration control.

78. The appellant's case includes the proposition that the  respondent  has
    some responsibility for what happened  to  the  appellant  at  Bakkavor
    Foods Limited.  The company was a Tier 2 sponsor.   As  such,  it  owed
    duties to the respondent.  Mr Saini provided us with  the  Home  Office
    Tier 2 and 5 Policy Guidance  for  Sponsors  (1  October  2013).   This
    describes the circumstances  in  which  the  respondent  may  revoke  a
    sponsor licence.  Such a  consequence  may  ensue  if  the  company  is
    "dishonest  in  any  dealings  with  us",  such  as  by  making   false
    statements.  It also includes failing to pay the  sponsor  migrant  "at
    least the appropriate rate for the job they had been sponsored to  do".
    There is also reference to the sponsor being required to  follow  "good
    practice guidance set  out  by  us  or  a  relevant  sector  or  body".
    Paragraph 658 provides that if the respondent believes that the company
    is breaching its duties and/or poses a threat to  immigration  control,
    the company's licence may be suspended.

79. The appellant's stance on  this  issue  runs  up  against  the  serious
    obstacle that, as we have observed, it does not appear she informed the
    respondent  at  any  material  time  of  the   difficulties   she   was
    experiencing with Bakkavor Foods Limited.  More fundamentally, however,
    it is difficult to see how the  respondent  can  be  expected  to  have
    intervened in any meaningful way.  The appellant's stance  assumes  the
    respondent must engage in a form of micro-management of the affairs  of
    sponsor companies, which is wholly unwarranted.  Even if the respondent
    had investigated and concluded that Mr Brar had made  a  comment  about
    the appellant's future sponsorship prospects  that  turned  out  to  be
    false, the appellant is silent as to what, if anything  the  respondent
    was supposed to have done.  We understood Mr Saini to  suggest  at  one
    point that the respondent should have revoked the company's sponsorship
    licence.  However, given what the Employment  Tribunal  said  about  Mr
    Brar's lack of authority, any such reaction would have been  draconian.
    It would have put at risk the  position  of  others  sponsored  by  the
    company.

80. Mr Saini sought to rely upon the  Upper  Tribunal  judgment  in  Mansur
    (immigration advisors failings: Article 8) Bangladesh [2018] UKUT  274.
    In that case, the Upper Tribunal held that the importance to  be  given
    to immigration control fell to be reduced where an immigration  adviser
    had acted contrary to an individual's  express  instructions  regarding
    the  withdrawal  of  an  appeal,  in  circumstances  that  led  to   an
    application for leave being held to be invalid.  The adviser  had  been
    found by the relevant regulator to be at fault in this regard.

81. The important point about Mansur, however, is that the  Upper  Tribunal
    was at pains to point out that the result was exceptional and that  "it
    will be only in a rare case that an adviser's failings will constitute"
    a reason to reduce the weight to  be  placed  on  the  relevant  public
    interest.  The Upper Tribunal emphasised that  such  weight  cannot  be
    reduced "just because there happen to be immigration advisers who offer
    poor advice and other services".  By the same token, just because there
    are employers whose staff sometimes behave in sub-optimal ways does not
    mean that the weight to be  given  to  immigration  control  should  be
    reduced.

82. So far, our analysis has proceeded without regard to  Part  5A  of  the
    2002 Act.  It is, however, necessary to address the submissions that Mr
    Saini made on these provisions, as  they  might  bear  on  the  present
    appeal.

83. Section 117B(1) provides that the maintenance of effective  immigration
    controls  is  in  the  public  interest.   That  statement  cannot   be
    overridden by a judicial decision.  However, as we  have  seen  in  the
    cases of true "historic injustice", the  weight  to  be  given  to  the
    public interest can be  so  diminished  that  any  private  life  which
    engages Article 8(1) will outweigh the diminished public interest.

84. We consider that in all cases in which, for whatever reason, the public
    interest falls to be given less than its  ordinary  weight,  the  usual
    course should be for the judge to so find  in  terms,  when  addressing
    section 117B(1).  We accept, however,  that  the  same  result  may  be
    achieved, at least in some situations, by qualifying the  consideration
    in section 117B(4) that little weight should be given to a private life
    formed when the person concerned is in the United  Kingdom  unlawfully.
    If, say, the respondent should for some reason have given an individual
    leave to remain, then one could perhaps give effect to that  factor  by
    ascribing more weight to his or her private life than  would  otherwise
    be mandated by section 117B(4).  The important point, however, is  that
    judicial fact-finders should avoid  any  recourse  to  double-counting,
    whereby not only is the weight to be  given  to  effective  immigration
    controls diminished but also, for the same reason, a  private  life  is
    given more weight than would otherwise  be  possible  by  an  undiluted
    application of section 117B(4).

85. Before us,  there  was  discussion  over  the  application  of  section
    117B(5), whereby little weight  should  be  given  to  a  private  life
    established by a person at a time when that person's immigration status
    is precarious.  Regardless of how Bakkavor Foods  Limited  should  have
    behaved towards the appellant, it remains the case that her status  has
    at all times been precarious, in that  she  has  at  all  times  lacked
    indefinite leave to remain: Rhuppiah v Secretary of State for the  Home
    Department [2018] UKSC  58.   In  the  Court  of  Appeal  judgments  in
    Rhuppiah [2016] EWCA Civ 803, Sales LJ said:-

         "54. ...  considerable  weight  should  be  given  to  Parliament's
             statement in section  117B(5)  regarding  the  approach  which
             should  normally  be  adopted.   In  order  to   identify   an
             exceptional case in which a departure from that approach would
             be justified, compelling reasons would have to be shown why it
             was not appropriate.  ..."

86. If then, one looks at the appellant's primary case through the lens  of
    section 117B(5),  "compelling reasons" would be needed  to  dilute  the
    effect of that subsection. It would be illogical if an  examination  of
    that same case through the lens of section 117B(1)  were not to require
    the same "compelling reasons".

87. Accordingly, however one approaches the  appellant's  primary  case  in
    section 117B, it remains the fact  that  the  public  interest  in  the
    maintenance  of  effective  immigration  control  cannot   lightly   be
    diminished.  The appellant's primary case  does  not  contain  anything
    which  required  Judge  Bulpitt  to  regard  the  public  interest   as
    diminished.

88. This leads directly to the  remaining  ground  of  challenge  to  Judge
    Bulpitt's decision; namely that in paragraph 22 he adopted too  high  a
    threshold in finding that the appellant "has  not  established  a  very
    strong or compelling claim required to outweigh the public interest  in
    immigration control".  Mr Saini submitted  that,  notwithstanding  that
    this language is taken  directly  from  paragraph  57  of  Lord  Reed's
    judgment in Agyarko, part of which was actually cited by Judge  Bulpitt
    at paragraph 19 of his decision, the language is indicative of  section
    117C(6) which, as  we  have  already  seen,  applies  only  to  foreign
    criminals sentenced to four or more years' imprisonment.  The appellant
    is not such a person.

89. We are not persuaded by this ground of challenge.  It is  difficult  to
    see how Judge Bulpitt could  have  erred  in  directly  following  Lord
    Reed's judgment  in  a  directly  analogous  situation.   Although  the
    vocabulary of the English language is very large, there is a  limit  to
    the kinds of expressions that may be employed in this area.   The  fact
    that section 117C(6) speaks of "very compelling  circumstances"  is  no
    reason to ignore or qualify paragraph 57 of Agyarko.   Section  117C(6)
    is referring to "very compelling circumstances, over  and  above  those
    described in Exceptions 1 and 2"; that is to say the exceptions set out
    in section  117C(4)  and  (5).   The  context  is,  accordingly,  quite
    different.

90. There is no suggestion at all that, in saying what he did at  paragraph
    22 of his decision, Judge Bulpitt  was  treating  the  appellant  as  a
    person who needed to satisfy section 117C(6).
