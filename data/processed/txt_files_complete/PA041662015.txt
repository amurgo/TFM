     Mr Winter, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr Matthews, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant identifies himself as a citizen of Iraq born on [ ] 1994.
     He appealed against the decision of the Respondent dated 14th December
    2015 refusing his asylum claim, his claim  on  humanitarian  protection
    grounds and his human rights claim.  The appeal was heard by  Judge  of
    the First-tier Tribunal Bradshaw on 30th August 2016 and  dismissed  on
    all grounds.

 2. An application for permission to appeal  was  made  and  permission  to
    appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge McWilliam in  January  2017.
    The permission states that the appeal essentially turns on  credibility
    and the judge made extensive findings  in  respect  of  this.   Because
    there  was  a  lack  of  credibility  the  judge  concluded  that   the
    Appellant's evidence in respect of the documentation provided  was  not
    acceptable and he concluded that the  Appellant,  a  Kurd  from  Kirkuk
    could safely return to the IKR.   The  permission  states  that  it  is
    arguable that the judge should then  have  considered  the  Appellant's
    journey from Baghdad  to  the  IKR.   Permission  was  granted  on  all
    grounds.

 3. There is a Rule 24 response dated 18th January 2017.  This  points  out
    that it does not appear to have been argued before the judge that there
    was a risk to the Appellant in travelling to the IKR as a Kurd per  se,
    nor was there any indication in the grounds as to what  evidence  would
    be required to support such an assertion.

 4. On 9th February 2017 the Appellant appeared before me and I found  that
    there was a material error of law in the First-tier Tribunal's decision
    on humanitarian protection grounds in  a  decision  promulgated  on  20
    February 2017.

 5. The Appellant might have to go overland to  Erbil  from  Baghdad.   The
    First-tier Tribunal Judge did not  assess  whether  this  would  engage
    Article 3 of ECHR or paragraph 15(c) of the Qualification Directive.  I
    found that more facts would have to  be  put  before  the  Tribunal  to
    enable this appeal to be  resolved  and  further  evidence  about  this
    particular issue would require to be provided  by  both  parties.   The
    findings of  fact  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal's  decision  were  not
    challenged, including the judge's finding that the Appellant  had  been
    untruthful in his evidence.  I  therefore  directed  that  the  judge's
    decision should stand relating to these issues of fact  and  the  issue
    which now has to be considered is whether, based on the facts  of  this
    case, together with any additional facts  and  evidence  which  can  be
    provided by both parties, this Appellant can return to Iraq and  travel
    to the IKR from Baghdad.  I asked for arguments to be  put  forward  by
    both parties for the Upper Tribunal's consideration and  adjourned  the
    case for a second stage hearing.

 6. This is that second stage hearing.

The Hearing

 7. Counsel for the Appellant submitted that based  on  this  evidence  now
    provided by the respondent, any submissions he  might  make  about  the
    Appellant's travel to Erbil from Baghdad  were  unlikely  to  help  the
    Appellant's claim.

 8. The Presenting Officer referred to me to item 7 in the Respondent's new
    bundle which is a copy of flight  details  from  Baghdad  International
    Airport to Erbil International Airport.  The cost  of  this  flight  is
    US$89.  He submitted that in Dr Fatah's report, which the Appellant  is
    relying  on,  he  states  that  the  cost  of  this  flight  would   be
    prohibitive.  The Presenting Officer  explained  that  he  had  made  a
    random search of flights and he produced flight details  for  a  flight
    from Baghdad to Erbil on Tuesday 9th May 2017.  He submitted that  this
    applicant, if he  accesses  assisted  voluntary  return,  will  receive
    �2,000 from the UK government.  I was referred to number 6 of the  same
    bundle.  This confirms that  if  the  appellant  applies  for  assisted
    voluntary return he will get up to �2,000 and  the  Presenting  Officer
    submitted that based  on  this  the  applicant  will  have  no  problem
    travelling from Baghdad to Erbil.

 9. He submitted that the Appellant's evidence is that he is from a wealthy
    family who paid $20,000 to transport the Appellant  from  Iraq  to  the
    United Kingdom.  He submitted that based on this evidence there  is  no
    error of law in the First-tier Tribunal's decision and  this  Appellant
    can return to Iraq and travel to the IKR.

10. Counsel accepted the position.

Notice of Decision

There is no material error of law in the  judge's  decision  promulgated  on
20th October 2016.  The First-tier Tribunal's decision shall stand and  this
Appellant's appeal for humanitarian protection is dismissed.

No anonymity direction is made.
