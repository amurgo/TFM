                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. The Appellant, born on 23rd February 1983, is a citizen of  Sri  Lanka.
    The Appellant was represented  by  Mr  Papasotiriou  of  Counsel.   The
    Respondent was represented by Ms Willocks-Briscoe, a Senior  Presenting
    Officer.

Substantive Issues under Appeal

 2. The Appellant had arrived in the UK as a student in September 2007  and
    made various successful applications to remain until  April  2013.   On
    9th May 2016 he made application for indefinite  leave  to  remain  and
    then on 11th October 2017 varied that application for settlement on the
    basis of long residence.  The Respondent had made enquiries  with  HMRC
    as part of their  consideration  of  that  application  and  had  noted
    differences in income disclosed to HMRC and that to  the  Home  Office.
    They had therefore refused his application under  paragraph  322(5)  of
    the  Immigration  Rules.   They  had  also  refused   the   Appellant's
    application on all grounds.

 3. The Appellant had appealed that decision and his appeal  was  heard  at
    Hatton Cross on 18th September 2018 by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal
    Ripley.  The judge had allowed the Appellant's appeal.  The  Respondent
    thereafter made application to appeal that decision and permission  was
    granted on 8th November 2018 on the basis that  it  was  arguable  that
    having found the Appellant  was  dishonest,  and  having  rejected  his
    explanation that he made a genuine mistake, the judge erred in  failing
    to treat his conduct as capable of coming within the ambit of paragraph
    322(5) of the Immigration Rules.  It was also said that it  was  not  a
    relevant factor that HMRC had not prosecuted him or sought  to  recover
    the unpaid tax.  Directions were  issued  for  the  Upper  Tribunal  to
    firstly decide whether an error of law had been made in this case.   In
    accordance with those directions the matter  came  before  me  on  20th
    December 2018.  Having heard submissions and considered the evidence  I
    found that a material error of law was made by the judge in  this  case
    for the reasons given in the  decision  promulgated  on  12th  February
    2019.

 4. Directions were issued for the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  to
    be set aside and the matter reheard in the Upper Tribunal.

The Proceedings - Introduction

 5. The matter came  before  me  for  a  fresh  hearing  with  the  parties
    represented as indicated above.  A notice under Rule 15(2A) dated  25th
    March 2019 had been sent on behalf of the Appellant including a list of
    evidence that was not before the original First-tier  Tribunal  hearing
    and the reasons why that evidence had not  been  submitted  before  the
    First-tier.  For the sake of completeness, and as it complied with  the
    Procedural Rules, I allowed in those documents.   Essentially,  Counsel
    on behalf of the Appellant accepted that documents listed 4 to 9 on the
    index to the Appellant's bundle had been  in  the  original  First-tier
    bundle and the documents at 10 to 66 had been  available  but  had  not
    been submitted before the First-tier Tribunal.

 6. The documents before me consist as follows.   The  Respondent's  bundle
    consists  of  the  original  bundle  available  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal consisting of:

       . Immigration history.

       . Those documents listed at folios A to H on the index sheet.

       . Refusal letter.

 7. The Appellant's documents consist of:

       . Skeleton argument.

       . Those documents listed at numbers 1 to 66 on the index sheet to the
         Appellant's bundle.

 8. Additionally, I had a Home Office document published 22nd November 2018
    being a review of applications refused under paragraph  322(5)  of  the
    Immigration Rules.

       . Dadzie [2018] CSOH 128, BT Nepal [2004] UKIAT 00311.

       . Government UK dividend tax rates  on  dividends  before  6th  April
         2016.

The Proceedings - Evidence

 9. The Appellant was called to give evidence.  He identified his name.  He
    identified his witness statement of 25th March 2019 as being  true  and
    correct and adopted that as his examination-in-chief.

10. In cross-examination he  said  that  he  had  two  accountants,  namely
    Accountancy Group Ltd and Exto Accountants.  He  had  instructed  both.
    He said he provided instructions to the Accountancy Group in  2012.   A
    few weeks later he had given them authority to contact HMRC.   He  said
    he did not have an online HMRC account.  He expected his accountants to
    submit his tax returns.  He did not know whether it would  be  done  by
    post or online.  He said that he received a number by post  and  passed
    that to the Accountancy Group.

11. He said when he moved to Ex Accountants he did not  set  up  an  online
    account.  He said his current accountants were Iykons and  he  did  not
    have an online account.  He said his accountants did.  At  page  55  he
    noted that that was a document emailed to him from his  accountant,  he
    said that he had emailed his accountants  back  and  he  did  not  have
    anything else to do.  He said before he got that document he  had  sent
    all his financial documents to the accountant.  They did not give him a
    copy of his tax return when they emailed him as referenced at page  55.
    He said his tax return for the year ending April 2017 was completed  by
    Iykons.  At page 39 was a document relating to Exlents.  He said he got
    that document in January 2015 and the accountant  gave  it  to  him  in
    person.  He did not do anything.  He was told  that  his  accounts  had
    been submitted for 2012/2013 and it was confirmed that  they  had  done
    that.  He said that they submitted the documents and he  did  not  have
    anything to do, they gave him a copy of the  document  after  they  had
    done everything.  At page 55 it was  pointed  out  that  there  was  no
    evidence that he had authorised the accountants  to  submit  documents.
    He said he had authorised them.  He said he had a  letter  saying  they
    were his authorised agents.  He said he had difficulties with his first
    accountants, Accountancy Group.  He  had  made  no  contact  with  HMRC
    during that period and he had not set up an  online  account  to  check
    what was happening.  He had not asked anyone from Accountancy Group  to
    attend at the hearing.  He said they had provided  him  a  letter.   He
    said he had not provided a contract signed with Accountancy  Group  and
    he did not recall signing any contract, nor them giving him  any  terms
    and  conditions.   When  he  joined  his  second  accountants,  Exlents
    Accountants he did not sign any contract  nor  receive  any  terms  and
    conditions.  He was referred to paragraph 20 of his witness  statement.
    He said his second  accountants  Exlents  had  submitted  his  accounts
    without his knowledge.  He was told  that  by  his  accountants  Iykons
    Accounting.  He said that he knew his accounts had been  filed  without
    his knowledge before he was told that by Iykons Accountancy.   He  knew
    in January 2015 that he had submitted accounts  without  his  knowledge
    for the years 2012/2013 and 2013/2014.  He did not know his accountants
    had submitted the tax returns in January 2015 and did not know  how  or
    when they were submitted.   He  did  not  give  authorisation  for  the
    documents at page 39 and 55 nor did he sign those documents.   When  he
    submitted his 2017 tax return he got confirmation  it  had  been  sent.
    Iykons Accountants had contacted him before they submitted  the  forms,
    they then went through all the figures.  He  authorised  the  2017  tax
    return to go through because Iykons did that.  He did not sign any  tax
    return with Iykons for 2017 but did authorise them  verbally.   He  was
    referred to paragraph 31 of his witness  statement.   He  said  he  had
    contacted HMRC on a regular basis and the first contact had been  March
    2016 and had been advised by his accountants to do that  to  amend  his
    2012/2013 return to add dividends.  He said that amendment was not done
    by Exlents Accountancy but he did it with the help of Iykons.   He  did
    not go to the police about his  former  accountants.   At  page  70  he
    referred to the successful submission of his tax return  in  2017.   He
    had received no letter or communication from HMRC throughout  his  time
    with Exlents or Accountancy Group.  He  said  he  did  receive  once  a
    letter for late payment of a fine which he gave  to  Accountancy  Group
    who said he did not  need  to  do  anything.   He  received  that  fine
    notification by post and passed that to Accountancy Group by email.  He
    said his amendment tax return for 2012/2013 was done by  post  and  his
    brother did not directly involve himself with his tax matters.  He  was
    referred to pages 116 and 188 and 114 of his bundle.   At  page  94  he
    said he did not know  that  Exlents  had  submitted  his  accounts  for
    2012/2013 and 2013/2014 before 2015.  He said the letter at page 94 was
    issued to him by HMRC at a previous address and  dated  2014.   He  was
    aware his accounts were late.  He thought that he  had  to  chase  that
    through the accountancy firm.  In September 2014 he received, he  said,
    another letter  saying  that  he  was  getting  a  fine  and  that  was
    referenced at page 15 of his witness statement.  At page  121  he  said
    this proved that he had taken action  against  Exlents  Accountancy  on
    27th February 2019.  He did it without either legal  representation  or
    other accountants.  He had made the calculation of the damages himself.
     He accepted that he had no documents that had been sent in evidence in
    support of his claim and he did not know how much he  was  billing  for
    his time.

12. He was re-examined on a number of points.

13. I next heard from the Appellant's brother.  He provided  his  name  and
    witness statement 25th March 2019 was identified as  true  and  correct
    and he adopted that.

14. In cross-examination  he  said  that  he  had  been  contacted  by  the
    Appellant  in  April  2016.   He  had  not  been  involved   with   any
    documentation prior to 2016 nor seen any paperwork.  He  did  not  help
    him find Exlents Accountants or the last accountants.  He said that the
    Appellant had taken advice from him as he tried to  assist  in  finding
    out which firm had done what for the Appellant.  He said  he  found  it
    difficult to accept that an accountancy firm would  miss  the  figures.
    He said his experience was in running  a  software  company  trying  to
    prevent tax fraud.  He said he had his own accountancy  firm  at  KPMG.
    He said that he had helped the Appellant with his  County  Court  claim
    and guided him on an online website.

15. In closing I heard submissions on behalf of the Respondent  who  relied
    upon the refusal letter.  I was referred  firstly  to  the  immigration
    timetable and the Appellant seeking to  vary  his  ILR  application  in
    2017.  He said the Appellant's case appeared to  rest  on  the  premise
    that HMRC had never reminded the Appellant that they needed tax returns
    and payments.  He further seems to claim  that  he  had  been  entirely
    reliant upon others who had been negligent and had done  nothing  until
    March 2016.  He blamed two separate  firms  of  accountants.   He  said
    there was inconsistency in the Appellant's account.  He said the recent
    civil action was simply done as a cover-up to cover the false  evidence
    provided.  Further, the Appellant appears to suggest that he  had  been
    poorly represented before the First-tier Tribunal  and  had  a  lot  of
    available documents now before us but they had not been provided by the
    solicitor to the Tribunal.  That,  it  was  submitted,  was  a  serious
    accusation against legal representatives but there was no evidence that
    such accusation had been put to them or an  explanation  provided.   It
    was submitted that false figures had been given  by  the  Appellant  in
    order to gain visa points and he  came  clearly  within  the  terms  of
    paragraph 322(5).

16. In closing I heard submissions on behalf of the  Appellant  and  I  was
    referred to the skeleton argument.  It was accepted there was  a  clear
    inference to be drawn by the disparity in the figures such that it  was
    accepted the Respondent had passed the evidential burden of proof.   It
    was said that the Appellant accepted failings  but  he  had  not  acted
    dishonestly.  It was said the Appellant was ignorant of all tax related
    matters and was dependent upon others who had been negligent.  He  said
    that the Appellant had provided all documents to  his  accountants  but
    was  unable  to  identify  inconsistencies  easily  and  had   complete
    ignorance of all matters related to tax and  it  was  unfortunate  that
    other people he relied upon had turned out to be  largely  incompetent.
    He said that Exlents Accountancy were not in court because there was  a
    dispute with the  Appellant.   It  was  said  that  the  Appellant  now
    realising the extent of the problem had sought  redress  in  the  Civil
    Courts recently.  He said the previous legal  representatives  had  not
    collected evidence and  placed  that  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    because those solicitors had relied upon the assertion that  dishonesty
    could not form part of paragraph 322(5).

17. At the conclusion of the hearing I reserved my decision to consider the
    documents and evidence submitted.  I now provide that decision with  my
    reasons.

Decision and Reasons

18. Since hearing  the  case  I  have  read  and  considered  the  case  of
    Balajigari and Others  [2019]  EWCA  Civ  673.   That  case  found  the
    approach taken by the Home Office in this type of case to be flawed  in
    two ways.  Firstly, the court found it was unfair for the  Home  Office
    not to provide the Appellant with an  opportunity  to  explain  matters
    before making a finding  of  dishonesty/deception.   Secondly,  it  was
    flawed to jump  from  that  finding  immediately  to  a  refusal  under
    paragraph 322(5) without consideration of all factors within the  terms
    of suitability.  However,  in  circumstances  where  an  Appellant  can
    exercise a right of appeal under Section 82 of the 2002  Act  then  the
    unfairness can be cured as the Appellant has the ability to provide  an
    explanation if necessary and all factors would need to be considered in
    the balancing exercise conducted under Article 8 of the ECHR (paragraph
    14, 222 to 223).

19. I  have  carefully  considered  all  the  evidence  in  this  case,  in
    particular the evidence given by the Appellant and  his  brother.   The
    Appellant's immigration history as  set  out  within  his  own  witness
    statement demonstrates he was no stranger to  the  immigration  process
    regarding Tier 1 (General) Migrant matters.  He applied  for  leave  to
    remain in that capacity in November 2010.  He  then  went  through  two
    reconsiderations of his original application before being granted leave
    for two years in April 2011.  The Appellant applied for an extension of
    his leave on  11th  April  2013.   As  part  of  that  application  the
    Appellant declared  self-employment  income  of  about  �56,000  earned
    between 10th April 2012 and 9th  April  2013.   As  a  result  of  that
    application the Appellant successfully obtained further leave until May
    2016 which in turn provided him with a sufficiency of time spent in the
    UK to then seek to remain indefinitely in the UK based  on  ten  years'
    residence.

20. The Appellant's circumstances and financial position in 2012/2013  were
    therefore significant.

21. The Appellant's witness statement  (6  to  10)  suggests  a  number  of
    factors occurring seemingly concurrently in that period.  The Appellant
    refers to working for a number of companies  before  his  Tier  1  visa
    ended in 2013.  He refers to a period of  illness.   However,  he  also
    refers to earning �56,000 as a self-employed businessman and it appears
    the sole director of a company One Channel Ltd.  It may be that company
    was short-lived because the Appellant refers to potential  problems  in
    the goods he imported, and refers to  joining  IPOS  to  install  their
    systems as a self-employed contractor from early 2014.

22.  The  significant  period  therefore  is  2012  to  2013  and  the  not
    insubstantial income declared by the  Appellant  as  a  start-up  self-
    employed sole  director.   The  Respondent  noted  that  the  Appellant
    declared �56,000 within the body of his visa application  in  order  to
    obtain a time extension in the UK.  However, in the tax year  2012/2013
    and 2013/2014 the Appellant declared no self-employment income to HMRC.
     It was only later in March 2016 when the Appellant was  first  seeking
    to apply for leave to remain indefinitely in the UK that he, either  on
    his own volition or with legal  advice,  sought  to  put  together  his
    financial records over the years as required by the Respondent.   As  a
    result of that he then provided  HMRC  with  revised  figures  for  his
    financial situation in that earlier period 2012/2013.

23. The Appellant's position and explanation  is  that  he  is  essentially
    ignorant of financial/accounting matters and was  wholly  reliant  upon
    professionals over a number of years and has  been  systematically  ill
    served by  such  professionals.   Hence,  he  claims  that  he  is  not
    dishonest and did not seek to dupe either the Respondent  or  HMRC  but
    rather is a victim of poor advice.

24. It is further said that because a substantial part  of  the  undeclared
    income was in fact dividends  paid  to  the  Appellant  rather  than  a
    salary, then little or no tax was due and therefore the mistake has not
    resolved in a financial loss to HMRC.  I find that latter point to have
    limited relevance.

25. The Appellant was a sole trader, having  started  One  Channel  Ltd  in
    about 2012.  To earn �56,000 at the start of such an enterprise as  the
    sole director could infer some degree of success and  business  acumen.
    The Appellant as sole director/operator was essentially responsible for
    providing an accountancy firm with the raw data required  to  formulate
    his accounts.  Accordingly, the  provision  of  invoices,  expenses  of
    various kinds, bank statements, creditors, debtors, etc., was what  the
    Appellant  collated.   I  find  it  lacking  in  credibility  that  the
    Appellant was unaware of  the  general  level  of  income/profit  being
    generated by his  company  when  he  was  the  sole  operator  and  was
    responsible for collecting that data.  Further, if the Appellant, as he
    claims, was paying himself dividends from the  company  rather  than  a
    salary, then that further infers a degree of knowledge  of  the  profit
    being generated and therefore  that  which  he  could  afford  to  give
    himself.

26. The Appellant claims that two separate accountancy  firms,  Accountancy
    Group and Exlents Accountants were both  negligent  in  their  dealings
    with his accounts.

27. In respect of the first firm, the Appellant suggests a  high  level  of
    negligence such that accounts were not filed with HMRC  to  the  extent
    that the Appellant was fined by HMRC.  He suggests that he took  little
    or no action unilaterally to discover the position with HMRC in respect
    of his tax returns.  He does  not  appear  to  have  taken  any  action
    against Accountancy Group at that time or for some time  later.   There
    has been no attendance from  Accountancy  Group  nor  any  full  letter
    explaining matters or seeking  to  set  out  the  potential  errors  or
    reasons for error.  The Appellant has provided no contract or terms and
    conditions or any other such paperwork  relating  to  his  relationship
    with Accountancy Group.  The letter dated 14th December 2018  allegedly
    from Accountancy Group postdates both the Home  Office  refusal  letter
    and the initial First-tier Tribunal appeal decision.   It  is  a  short
    letter providing almost no information and provides a caveat  that  the
    information is provided without any responsibility.  In respect of  the
    second accountancy firm, Exlents, the Appellant suggests that they were
    also negligent.  He suggests that they submitted his  accounts  without
    his knowledge or consent.  I do not accept that as credible.  I find it
    highly unlikely an accountancy firm would act in  such  a  manner,  and
    would on the face of it have nothing to gain in so acting or that  HMRC
    would accept unsigned, unverified accounts.  The Appellant claims  that
    the documents at pages 39 and 55 of his  bundle  from  the  accountants
    requiring his signature and verification of accounts before being  sent
    to HMRC were not in fact provided  to  him  and  that  the  accountants
    submitted accounts for the years 2012/2013 and  2013/2014  without  his
    knowledge.  He claimed in cross-examination that he was  told  this  by
    his third accountants.  However,  he  had  also  claimed  to  know  his
    accounts were submitted without his knowledge  before  instructing  his
    third accountants.  I find no credibility in the  Appellant's  somewhat
    contorted and often confusing account that his second accountancy  firm
    submitted accounts without his knowledge or authorisation.

28. I  find  the  Appellant's  attempt  to  blame  two  separate  firms  of
    accountants for the late and/or wrong filing of figures to HMRC  to  be
    entirely lacking in credibility and rather than providing  an  innocent
    explanation for the significant inconsistency of figures for  2012/2013
    merely heightens the level of  incredibility  and  points  towards  the
    Appellant's true behaviour and motives.

29. The Appellant, however, takes the matter further.  He acknowledges that
    at the time of the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal in  September
    2018 almost all the documents in his current bundle were available  and
    could have been presented as evidence before the  First-tier  Tribunal.
    He concedes, however, that only those documents at pages 19 to 37  were
    presented.  He now presents a bundle that extends  beyond  page  37  to
    page 220.  The explanation for such an original slender bundle is  that
    his former Counsel had advised that the alleged dishonest behaviour  of
    the Appellant fell outwith the remit  of  paragraph  322(5)  which  was
    essentially concerned with terrorist behaviour and therefore  the  case
    could  be  argued  solely  on  that  basis  and   therefore   no   such
    documentation would be needed.  I do not accept that explanation  given
    by the Appellant for the failure to present to the First-tier  Tribunal
    a substantial body of documentation that was available  at  that  time,
    according to the Appellant.

30. Firstly, there  has  been  no  attempt  by  the  Appellant  or  current
    representatives  to  put  that  assertion  to  the  Appellant's  former
    representative and to produce a reply.  Secondly, whilst the First-tier
    Tribunal  decision   discloses   Mr   Kannangara   did   indeed   argue
    (successfully) that the Appellant's behaviour was outwith the remit  of
    paragraph 322(5) I find it highly unlikely a representative would  have
    relied upon that argument alone  and  to  the  extent  of  refusing  to
    consider  available  documentation.    Thirdly,   the   Appellant   was
    essentially  being   accused   of   dishonesty   by   the   Respondent.
    Irrespective of any concept of  paragraph  322(5)  I  would  expect  an
    Appellant in that situation to be desirous of  clearing  his  name.   I
    find the explanation provided for the absence of documents  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal to be without credibility.  The attempt to blame  a
    former representative seems merely to be in line with  the  Appellant's
    attempt to blame two former firms of accountants.

31. I have considered the documents provided and I have also considered the
    brother's evidence, albeit that is  of  limited  value.   I  have  also
    looked at the Appellant's immigration history and the history over  the
    years of his  employment/self-employment.   I  am  satisfied  that  the
    significant discrepancy between the income declared to the Home  Office
    on the visa application in 2013 and that declared to HMRC in  the  same
    tax year to be highly suspicious, the  Respondent  thereby  discharging
    the evidential burden of proof, and deserving of  an  explanation  from
    the Appellant.  I have regarded the features within the case of Khan as
    being examples of potential  failures  to  innocently  explain  matters
    rather than a definitive checklist.  I have also  carefully  considered
    the commentary in Balajigari in respect of the case of  Khan.   I  find
    the  Appellant  has  not  provided  an  innocent  explanation  for  the
    significant suspicion aroused by those differences in figures.  Indeed,
    I find his explanation is in part confusing and inconsistent,  in  part
    simply an attempt to blame others.

32. I am satisfied the Appellant knowingly and deliberately hugely inflated
    his alleged earnings for the years 2012/2013 in his visa application in
    2013 to seek to remain in the UK for a sufficiently lengthy  period  of
    time in order to then apply for indefinite leave to remain  as  he  has
    now so done.  I find his deliberate exaggeration on which a crucial and
    significant factor relating to immigration control was based  to  be  a
    serious matter.  I also note the commentary  in  Balajigari  (paragraph
    37) where it was said that in the context  of  an  earning  discrepancy
    case it is very hard to see how the deliberate and dishonest submission
    of false earning figures whether to HMRC or the Home Office  would  not
    constitute dishonest conduct.

33. I find the Appellant's conduct to be dishonest.  I  find  it  to  be  a
    serious case of its type, not  just  in  relation  to  the  significant
    difference in figures  given  but  the  persistence  of  the  Appellant
    dishonestly over time seeking to blame others.  There is a lot at stake
    for the Appellant in terms of his desire to live indefinitely in the UK
    and he has been prepared in my view to deploy a consistent and  serious
    level of dishonesty to achieve that purpose.

34. I have considered all the evidence relating to the  Appellant  and  his
    circumstances.  I accept the length of time he has been in the  UK  and
    the employment he has had.  I acknowledge his  brother's  presence  and
    working life  and  have  looked  at  the  situation  of  the  Appellant
    returning  to  Sri  Lanka.   The  Appellant's  bundle  focuses   almost
    exclusively in attempting to justify his financial  claim  and  focuses
    very little on what may be regarded as his potential  position  in  Sri
    Lanka or his private life in the UK.  I find  when  balancing  all  the
    facts available the Home Office were entitled to refuse the Appellant's
    case under paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules.  I  do  not  find
    that there would be any obstacles to the  Appellant  returning  to  Sri
    Lanka bearing in mind the length of time he lived there, his education,
    qualifications and potential for employment together with family  still
    present in that country.  I do not find therefore  that  the  Appellant
    comes within the terms of the Immigration Rules leaving aside the issue
    of paragraph 322(5).  When considering all the factors outside  of  the
    Rules under Article 8 the removal of the Appellant would not in my view
    be disproportionate.  I bear in mind as I must, all aspects of  Section
    117B of the 2002 Act and the public interest in  immigration  controls.
    That factor should not be diluted in circumstances such  as  this  case
    presents.  A removal in my view would be entirely proportionate.
