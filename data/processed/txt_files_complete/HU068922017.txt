Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms A Oji (for Lewis Sidhu Solicitors)
For the Respondent:    Ms J Isherwood (Home Office Specialist Appeals Team)



                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is the appeal of Damian [S], a citizen of Jamaica born 17  April
       1999, against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal of 4 July  2018
       dismissing his appeal against the refusal of entry clearance of 7 May
       2017.


    2. The application was made on 5 February 2017,  and  was  to  join  his
       father, the Sponsor Lloyd [S], who had been granted indefinite  leave
       to remain on 21 June 2003 and naturalised as  a  British  citizen  in
       2005. The application explained that the Appellant had lived with his
       mother until, and been abused by  her  partners,  Mr  Morris  and  Mr
       Vernon, from 2003 onwards. He had lived with Ann  [L]  from  2014  to
       2015. He had been staying with  Pauline  [B]  since  September  2016,
       though could no longer remain with her because  her  responsibilities
       for her own two children were too great, as was confirmed in a letter
       she wrote. A court order of 15 September 2016 agreed for the transfer
       of custody between the mother and Sponsor.

    3. The application was refused because the Appellant had spent  most  of
       his life living apart from the  Sponsor  without  his  father  having
       sought to bring him to the UK, and  there  was  no  good  reason  for
       things to now change; there was no evidence to corroborate the claims
       of domestic abuse from the school or a health professional,  and  the
       mother's agreement to the Sponsor  taking  custody  post-dated  those
       claimed  difficulties  by  three  years.  Furthermore  a  visit  visa
       application of 2016 had not mentioned any difficulties at  home,  was
       made using the mother's address on the basis that the  Appellant  had
       lived there for the previous seven years, and Ms Lynch's address  was
       more than an hour's drive from the school he attended, casting doubts
       as to whether he truly resided with her.

    4. Grounds of appeal included medical evidence showing that the  Sponsor
       had been unable to work until  July  2014  and  had  thus  previously
       lacked the ability to maintain his son,  which  was  why  no  earlier
       application had been made; and asserted that whilst the Appellant had
       resided with Ms Lynch in recent  times,  nevertheless  his  permanent
       address was that of his mother.

    5. The First-tier Tribunal directed itself that there were two potential
       routes to entry,  via  sole  responsibility  or  because  there  were
       serious reasons for thinking a child's exclusion undesirable (bearing
       in mind authorities such as SG Nepal and Mundeba), and  that  it  was
       necessary to have regard to  the  best  interests  of  the  child  in
       assessing the claim under the Rules and  with  regard  to  Article  8
       ECHR.

    6. The First-tier  Tribunal  made  factual  findings.  It  accepted  the
       general credibility of the Sponsor, who was thus established as being
       able to accommodate and financially support the  Appellant,  that  he
       had visited Jamaica to see the boy regularly, regularly sent money to
       him, and had taken an active role in the  Appellant's  education  and
       upbringing.

    7. The Tribunal below did not accept the account of physical abuse  from
       the mother's  partners,  absent  corroborative  medical  evidence  or
       evidence from the school, and noted that the Sponsor referred only to
       Damian having difficulties with  his  mother's  partner  because  the
       latter did not want him around, without referring  to  any  beatings.
       The Tribunal accepted that the Appellant left his mother's house  due
       to problems with Mr Vernon, and stayed with Ms Lynch as claimed,  and
       that he presently resided with Ms Bruce-George. However  it  did  not
       accept that he could no longer reside  with  Ms  Bruce-George,  given
       that she had accommodated him for some time, there was no evidence of
       lack of space or practical problems, and the absence of evidence from
       the Sponsor that she could no longer accommodate the Appellant.

    8. Having regard to those findings, the Judge went on  to  consider  the
       routes under the Rules, bearing in mind that  the  ground  of  appeal
       depended on demonstrating a breach of the  Human  Rights  Convention.
       There was no evidence that the mother had derogated her role  in  her
       son's  upbringing  that   might   fix   the   Appellant   with   sole
       responsibility. He had been a present and  active  father.  The  mere
       transfer of custody  via  a  court  order  (one  which  provided  for
       "liberal contact" with the mother) did not mean that  thereafter  the
       mother played no role in her son's care any more than  it  ruled  out
       the possibility of the Sponsor having previously taken a  significant
       role in his life.

    9. That left the question of whether the Appellant's exclusion from  the
       UK was undesirable. Relevant considerations,  having  regard  to  the
       Appellant's best interests, were continuity of  residence  and  being
       with at least one parent. Although the Appellant did no live with his
       mother,  he  remained  in  contact  with  her,  and  was   adequately
       accommodated by Ms Bruce-George; he had a good relationship with  his
       father.  At the date of application he was on a  Careers  Advancement
       Course due to finish in June 2018. Assessing things in the round, the
       Judge concluded that his  best  interests  narrowly  pointed  towards
       coming to the UK, by a very small margin.

   10. Having regard to considerations such as evidence of neglect or  abuse
       (the evidence for which had been rejected), unmet needs,  and  stable
       arrangements for physical care, the Judge concluded that  Applicant's
       needs would be equally well served by staying  in  Jamaica  with  his
       mother, albeit wop necessarily living with  her,  as  they  would  by
       uprooting to join his father.  His  father  was  able  to  visit  him
       regularly now and the Appellant would be cared for in Jamaica. He was
       now in education having succeeded in his  Stage  3  City  and  Guilds
       Mathematics. Overall his circumstances did not  present  serious  and
       compelling reasons making his exclusion undesirable.

   11. Grounds of appeal dated 7 August 2018 argued that

        a) The appropriate standard of proof was the "reasonable
           likelihood"; the Tribunal had applied too high a standard of
           proof, as was shown by the rejection of aspects of the
           Appellant's case, including the claim of physical violence - why
           else, their author asked, would the Appellant have left his
           mother's home, and in any event emotional abuse was as damaging
           as physical;

        b) Relevant considerations were not adequately taken into account,
           for example the fact that the Appellant had lived in disruptive
           circumstances since 2014;

        c) There was no consideration of Section 117B NIA 2002.

   12. The First-tier Tribunal granted permission to  appeal  on  9  October
       2018 on the basis that too stringent a test  on  sole  responsibility
       might have been applied.


   13.  Ms  Oji  submitted  that  the  mother   had   inevitably   renounced
       responsibility fully, and the Judge had applied an overly strict test
       in  rejecting  the  case  put.  The  Custody  Order  was  of  central
       importance.  Given  it  was  accepted  that  the  Rules  were  mostly
       satisfied, it was essential that there  was  the  closest  engagement
       with the Appellant's case having  regard  to  all  the  evidence.  Ms
       Isherwood replied that the First-tier Tribunal had made  no  material
       errors of law and had come to a decision that it was  fully  entitled
       to make in the light of the evidence before it.


Findings and reasons

   14. It is an axiom of  the  Upper  Tribunal's  jurisdiction  that  it  is
       necessary to identify a material error of law before it can interfere
       with the factual findings below. A relevant error can be  established
       by a lack of  reasoning  or  irrationality,  or  a  failure  to  take
       relevant evidence into account; or by overt misdirection such  as  in
       relation to the standard of proof.


   15. The authorities recognise that reasons must be  given  for  both  the
       determination of the appeal and the material findings  of  fact  upon
       which that decision is based and they must be provided in  sufficient
       detail to "enable the reader to know  what  conclusion  the  decision
       maker has reached on the principal controversial  issues":  see  Lord
       Bridge in Save Britain's Heritage v No 1 Poultry  Ltd  [1991]  1  WLR
       153. As noted by Beatson LJ in Haleemudeen [2014] EWCA Civ  558  �35,
       37:


           "What is required is  that  the  reasons  must  give  sufficient
           detail to  show  the  parties  and  the  appellate  tribunal  or
           reviewing court the principles upon which the lower tribunal has
           acted, and the reasons that led it to its decision, so that they
           are able to understand why it reached its decision. The  reasons
           need not be elaborate, and need not  deal  with  every  argument
           presented ... judicial restraint should be  exercised  when  the
           reasons that  a  tribunal  gives  for  its  decision  are  being
           examined and it should not  be  assumed  too  readily  that  the
           tribunal misdirected  itself  because  not  every  step  in  its
           reasoning is set out in it".


   16. Lord Sumption stated in Hayes v Willoughby [2013] UKSC 17 �14:


           "A test of rationality ... applies a minimum objective standard
           to the relevant person's mental processes. It imports a
           requirement of good faith, a requirement that there should be
           some logical connection between the evidence and the ostensible
           reasons for the decision, and (which will usually amount to the
           same thing) an absence of arbitrariness, of capriciousness or of
           reasoning so outrageous in its defiance of logic as to be
           perverse."


   17. As stated by Carnwath LJ in Mukarkar [2007] Imm AR 57 �40:


           "It is of the nature of such judgments that different tribunals,
           without illegality or irrationality, may reach different
           conclusions on the same case ... The mere fact that one tribunal
           has reached what may seem an unusually generous view of the
           facts of a particular case does not mean that it has made an
           error of law ... Nor does it create any precedent, so as to
           limit the Secretary of State's right to argue for a more
           restrictive approach on a similar case in the future. However,
           on the facts of the particular case, the decision of the
           specialist tribunal should be respected."


   18. Where the reasoning of the  First-tier  Tribunal  is  comprehensible,
       then however objectionable it may be, the  complaint  is  essentially
       one of rationality, unless the reasons given fail to take account  of
       relevant evidence or considerations. Equally, a  complaint  regarding
       the standard of proof needs to identify some express misdirection; or
       at least be able to point to some overt feature of the finding  which
       is flatly inconsistent with the standard of proof (see eg Lewison  LJ
       in ME (Sri Lanka) [2018] EWCA Civ 1486 �18).


   19. It seems to me that the grounds of appeal and  Ms  Oji's  submissions
       amount to no more than a challenge to the factual  findings,  without
       reaching the necessary threshold at  which  the  Upper  Tribunal  can
       intervene. The mere fact that an assertion  is  made  in  adversarial
       proceedings does not demand  its  acceptance,  so  long  as  reasoned
       findings are made on the key issues that in dispute.

   20. Here the Tribunal's reasons are perfectly comprehensible. It accepted
       the strength of family life between  father  and  son,  but  did  not
       accept that the mother played no role in the  boy's  life,  which  is
       understandable given that she was allowed extensive contact under the
       court order. The lack of supporting medical evidence for the  alleged
       physical harm the boy suffered was a perfectly sustainable basis  for
       questioning the reality of any abuse; true it is that emotional abuse
       can be as serious  as  physical,  but  that  could  equally  well  be
       attested to by corroborative evidence from a reliable source, and one
       can well see why the Tribunal sought  corroboration  given  that  the
       father's own statement did not clearly detail any such  mistreatment.
       Once the mistreatment was ruled out, it was  relatively  unsurprising
       that  the  Tribunal  considered  that  the  Appellant  would   suffer
       significant disruption by uprooting to this country for only  a  very
       modest  benefit,  a  state  of  affairs  that  did  not  represent  a
       disproportionate interference with the family life in play.

   21. Whilst it may well be true that there was no express consideration of
       the public interest factors identified in  section  117B  NIAA  2002,
       this was because the factual findings on the appeal  were  such  that
       those considerations could have very little role to play.  As  stated
       in Rhuppiah [2018] UKSC 58 �57:

           "In seeking to portray the strength of their private or family
           life by reference to all their circumstances, claimants may wish
           to highlight their ability to speak English and/or their
           financial independence; but the legitimate deployment of such
           factors in that context is to be contrasted with the erroneous
           further submission that the subsections propel a conclusion
           that, where those factors exist, there is a public interest in
           favour of the claims."

   22. So in an entry clearance case, those factors are essentially  neutral
       in impact; they can be relevant to demonstrating the  strength  of  a
       person's connection with UK society generally,  but  that  is  hardly
       relevant in a case where the applicant has always  lived  abroad  and
       relies on family life with a parent. Precariousness of  residence  is
       also a neutral factor in this case; the Appellant has never lived  in
       this country, lawfully or otherwise, and the father's settled  status
       entitles him to apply for his son to join him here, but that  is  the
       starting point, not the end, of the application's viability.


   23. In summary, given the absence of any  failings  to  take  account  of
       material considerations by the First-tier Tribunal,  the  Appellant's
       challenge to the decision on "standard of proof" grounds amounts to a
       claim  that  the  reasoning  is  inadequate  or  perverse.  There  is
       certainly no overt misdirection on standard of proof; essentially the
       point is a disguised rationality challenge. It seems to me  that  the
       Tribunal's reasoning on the material issues is perfectly clear to the
       informed reader.


   24. I accordingly find that  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
       should stand.

          Decision:

    The appeal is dismissed.
