                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Thew promulgated on 16 July  2014  dismissing  the  Appellant's  appeal
    against the decision of the Respondent dated 18 October 2013 to  refuse
    to issue  a  residence  card  pursuant  to  the  Immigration  (European
    Economic Area) Regulations 2006.

Background

 2. The Appellant is a national of Nigeria born on 10 February 1974.  Brief
    details of his personal  and  immigration  histories  are  set  out  at
    paragraphs 1, 3, and 7 of the determination of the First-tier Tribunal.
    For present  purposes  what  is  particularly  pertinent  is  that  the
    Appellant is the father of Onoyemifrancesco John  Onojobi,  an  Italian
    national born in the UK on 9 June 2007. By way of form EEA2  signed  on
    18  September  2012,  and  an  accompanying  cover  letter   from   his
    representatives dated 8 November 2012, the Appellant applied "for leave
    to remain in the UK under regulation 15A of the  Immigration  (European
    Economic Area) Regulations 2006". The application was  treated  by  the
    Respondent as application for a residence card as the  parent/carer  of
    an EEA national child.

 3. The Respondent refused  the  application  for  reasons  set  out  in  a
    'reasons for refusal' letter ('RFRL')  dated  18  October  2013  and  a
    Notice of Immigration Decision was issued in consequence.

 4. The Appellant appealed to the IAC.

 5. The First-tier Tribunal Judge  dismissed  the  Appellant's  appeal  for
    reasons set out in her determination, both under  the  EEA  Regulations
    and on human rights grounds.

 6. The Appellant sought permission to appeal which was granted  by  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Grant-Hutchison on 15 August 2014. In  the  grounds
    in support of the application for permission to  appeal  the  Appellant
    pleaded matters relevant to Article 8, and did not pursue his  case  in
    respect of the EEA Regulations which he had conceded before the  First-
    tier Tribunal.

 7. The Respondent has filed a  Rule  24  response  dated  26  August  2014
    resisting the challenge to the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

Consideration: Error of Law

 8. The specific domestic arrangements of the Appellant are not  manifestly
    clear in his application. In particular  nothing  overt  is  stated  in
    respect of the Appellant's son's mother. The address of the Appellant's
    son is given as the same address  as  the  Appellant;  there  are  some
    supporting documents showing the same address for 'Miss  M  Monterisi',
    and there are a number of  family  photographs  which  appear  to  show
    mother, father, and child. In the Grounds of Appeal to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal attached to the Notice of Appeal  reference  is  made  to  the
    separation of the Appellant from his  son's  mother.  Further,  in  the
    event, at the appeal hearing it was  evident  that  the  Appellant  had
    separated from his son's mother - Ms Maria  Monterisi  -  in  May  2012
    (paragraph 7), and the Appellant had weekend staying contact,  as  well
    as seeing his son at other times during the week (paragraph 8).

 9. It is not clear whether such matters were previously  apparent  to  the
    Respondent, who refused the application under the EEA Regulations  only
    on the basis of the absence of  comprehensive  sickness  insurance.  Be
    that as it may, it is clear that the Appellant could not have  met  the
    requirements of regulation 15A because he was not the primary carer  of
    his son. As much was conceded before the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  by
    the Appellant's representative, and reliance was placed on Article 8 of
    the ECHR: see paragraph 15.

10. I pause to note in this context  that  once  the  Judge  had  permitted
    amendment of the Grounds of Appeal, the Respondent did  not  apparently
    seek to challenge the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to consider  Article
    8 issues in the context of an appeal against an EEA decision. There has
    been no cross-appeal in this regard, and no jurisdictional issue raised
    in the Rule 24 response or in oral submissions before me. It appears to
    have been common ground  throughout  that  the  approach  taken  in  JM
    (Liberia), to the effect  that  the  ground  of  appeal  under  section
    84(1)(g) is available notwithstanding the absence of an actual  removal
    decision, applies

11. Having set out preliminary paragraphs  concerning  the  nature  of  the
    appeal, and paragraphs recording the evidence at the hearing, the Judge
    set out her 'Analysis of Evidence and Conclusions' at paragraphs 14-35.

12. In particular the Judge made findings that:

    (i)    The Appellant's ex-partner was the primary carer of their child,
         was in a new relationship,  and  had  a  further  child  from  that
         relationship;

    (ii)   The Appellant had extensive contact with his son pursuant  to  a
         schedule of arrangements set out in  an  order  from  the  Edmonton
         Family Court which included taking him to school every morning from
         his mother's house, picking him up after school  on  Wednesdays  to
         take into gym classes, and staying contact  on  alternate  weekends
         beginning with connection from school on  Friday  and  ending  with
         returning him to school on Monday.

    (iii)  Ms Monterisi had in her  recent  post-natal  period  experienced
         mental health problems, including suicidal ideation ("a significant
         decline in her mental state including  thoughts  about  ending  her
         life")  and  a  panic  attack.  Mental  health  team  professionals
         considered she suffered "significant anxiety,  panic  episodes  and
         low mood".

    (iv)   A letter from his school describes the Appellant's son as having
         "supportive parents".

    (v)    The Appellant produced evidence of earnings of  �11,000  to  the
         year ending April 2014. His bank statements  showed  that  he  made
         payments to support his son.

13. Further to the above in the context of considering section  55  of  the
    Borders, Citizenship and Immigration  Act  2001  the  Judge  found,  at
    paragraph 31:

         "There is no doubt that that contact is of benefit  and  importance
         to the child, given that he lived in the same  household  with  his
         father and mother until she left the address  where  the  appellant
         still lives, in May 2012. Since that time the child  has  seen  his
         father regularly and the terms of the court order  include  staying
         access. Without question there would be an impact on the  child  if
         he were not able to have the level of contact  with  the  appellant
         that he currently has."

14. The Judge found that the Appellant did not satisfy  those  requirements
    of the Immigration Rules that addressed private life  and  family  life
    pursuant to Article 8 of the ECHR. The conclusion in respect of private
    life under paragraph 276 ADE (paragraph 34) appears inevitable  and  is
    not disputed. The conclusion in respect of family life  under  Appendix
    FM with particular reference to Section EX (paragraph  30)  is,  in  my
    judgement far less clear: see further below.

15. At paragraphs 32 and 33 the Judge set out passages  from  the  case  of
    Gulshan [2013] UKUT 00640 (IAC). In my judgement, however,  it  is  not
    apparent how the Judge applied such case  law  to  the  facts  of  this
    particular appeal. Be that as it  may,  the  Judge  in  any  event,  at
    paragraph 34, essentially addressed the  first  four  Razgar  questions
    (without making express reference to Razgar) and  identified  that  the
    issue of proportionality needed to be addressed: "I  now  turn  to  the
    issue of proportionality and whether  the  respondent  has  established
    that the decision was a proportionate one and whether the appellant has
    established that there are compelling  circumstances  not  sufficiently
    recognised under the Rules".

16. I pause to note that in addressing the first two Razgar  questions  the
    Judge made reference to the existence of  "private  life  that  engages
    Article 8" without referring to  family  life.  This  is  a  surprising
    reference in circumstances where this case was so very obviously  about
    family life.  However,  in  context,  and  given  that  the  Judge  has
    otherwise addressed the relationship between the Appellant and his  son
    I am inclined to the view that such a reference is by  way  of  a  slip
    rather than indicative of a failure to address the pertinent issues  in
    the appeal.

17. The Judges 'proportionality' evaluation is set out at paragraph  35.  I
    find that I am wholly unable to understand the basis of her  conclusion
    from that paragraph. The Judge in effect says no more than that she has
    taken into account the circumstances, but that they do  not  amount  to
    compelling  circumstances  not  sufficiently   recognised   under   the
    immigration rules: "On the evidence before me I conclude that  they  do
    not". However, she does not go on to say why: no reason is offered  for
    such a conclusion.  In  this  context  whilst  I  note  that  Mr  Duffy
    valiantly sought to defend the decision of the Judge - submitting  that
    in the effect the Judge was saying that  notwithstanding  the  positive
    features in the case they were 'not enough' - he acknowledged  that  it
    might be reasonably inferred that the Judge having directed herself  to
    the case of Gulshan she  must,  in  thereafter  going  on  to  consider
    Article 8, have at the very least satisfied  herself  that  there  were
    arguably good grounds for granting leave to remain outside  the  Rules,
    (irrespective of whether such an 'intermediate' step was a proper  part
    of the relevant test). Further,  he  acknowledge  that  thereafter  the
    Judge had not really 'spelt out' the basis of her ultimate conclusion.

18. In  my  judgement  this  lack  of  clear  reasoning  is  compounded  by
    deficiencies in the Judge's analysis of the Rules in respect of  family
    life - which necessarily impacted upon her approach to the question  of
    the extent to which the  Appellant's  circumstances  were  sufficiently
    recognised under the Rules.

19. The Judge did not expressly address section R-LTRPT - requirements  for
    limited leave to remain as a parent - but considered paragraph EX.1  in
    isolation, even though  it  is  well  established  that  it  is  not  a
    freestanding provision: see paragraph 30. That in itself would not be a
    material error given that the  Appellant  would  have  had  to  satisfy
    paragraph EX.1 in any event (at least because he  could  not  meet  the
    immigration requirements of E-LTRPT.3.2), and  also  given  that  those
    matters in respect of which the Judge was not satisfied on  EX.1  would
    also have been germane in respect of  the  'relationship  requirements'
    specified at E-LTRPT.2.2. The Judge was not satisfied in respect of the
    requirement that the child have "lived in the UK  continuously  for  at
    least the 7 years immediately preceding the date of  application".  The
    Judge took the date of application to be 9 November 2012, the  date  of
    the EEA application. In my judgement this was in error.

20. R-LTRPT.1.1(b) specifies a requirement that the applicant have  made  a
    valid application for limited leave to remain  as  a  parent.  The  EEA
    application was not such an application. Whilst  at  first  blush  this
    would appear to mean that the Appellant could  not  possibly  meet  the
    requirements for  limited  to  leave  as  a  parent  under  the  Rules,
    paragraph  GEN.1.9(iv)  obviates  the  need  to  have  made   a   valid
    application when the Article 8 claim is raised in an appeal.

21. This begs the question of exactly when such an 'application' is  deemed
    to be made: it might potentially be the date upon which the  appeal  is
    lodged, or it might be as late as the hearing of  the  appeal.  On  the
    facts of this particular case it is to be noted that the  substance  of
    the case under Appendix FM was advanced in terms in the letter dated 12
    June 2014 sent on 13 June 2014 applying to amend the grounds of appeal:
    see determination at paragraph 14.  Necessarily this, just,  post-dates
    the Appellant's son's seventh birthday and therefore his seven years of
    residence in the UK.

22. Whether that is the correct approach or not, the  Judge's  approach  to
    the Rules was such that in effectively evaluating the  period  of  time
    the Appellant's son had spent in the UK by reference to the date of the
    EEA application, she determined (without recognising it) that the Rules
    did not recognise the reality of the situation that by the date of  the
    hearing before the First-tier Tribunal the Appellant's son had been  in
    the UK for a further 20 months and in any event for more than 7 years.

23. Nor did the Rules in this regard fully cover or consider the reality of
    the Appellant's particular circumstances. Paragraph  EX.1  involves  an
    evaluation of the disruption to the private life  of  a  child  in  the
    event of having to quit the UK in consequence of  the  removal  of  the
    principal   adult   applicant:   paragraph   EX.1(a)(ii)   makes   this
    particularly apparent. In a situation such as the Appellant's where the
    relevant child is residing with another parent from whom the  applicant
    is separated, and where it is clear that it would not be reasonable  to
    expect the child to leave the UK for reasons other than the  length  of
    time he has been residing here, the Rules give no such  recognition  or
    weight to the unreasonableness of expecting the child to leave  the  UK
    and/or thereby  not  recognise  or  accord  weight  to  the  consequent
    separation of adult applicant and child.

24. In the circumstances I find that the Judge's analysis  of  Appendix  FM
    was in  error,  and  in  consequence  she  failed  to  appreciate  when
    considering Article 8 that the Appellant's circumstances -  and  indeed
    those of his EEA national son - were not sufficiently recognised  under
    the Rules. In my judgement this, together with the absence of any clear
    reason at paragraph 35, is such that the  decision  in  the  appeal  is
    flawed for error of law and must be set aside

Re-making the decision

25. Although I have found  error  of  law  in  respect  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge's reasoning and more particularly  the  absence  of  any
    clear reasons in respect of proportionality - no similar  criticism  is
    to be made of the Judge's primary fact  finding.  As  noted  above  the
    Judge has set out in some detail  the  evidence  and  her  findings  in
    respect of the circumstances of the Appellant  and  in  particular  his
    relationship with his son, and the circumstances of his  son's  mother.
    Accordingly, it was common ground before me that the  decision  in  the
    appeal could be remade before the Upper Tribunal and without  the  need
    to call further evidence. I therefore proceeded by way  of  submissions
    from the representatives.

26. Accordingly, I 'take forward' the First-tier Tribunal Judge's  findings
    of primary fact. Given those findings of fact, and my own consideration
    and evaluation of the evidence, I note in particular the following:

    (i)    In circumstances where the Appellant's son is an  EEA  national,
         as is his mother, and where his mother is in a new relationship and
         has had a child within that new relationship, I find  that  plainly
         it would not be reasonable to expect the Appellant's son  to  leave
         the UK. The son's relocation would either involve  him  leaving  in
         the company of the  Appellant  but  without  his  mother  and  half
         sibling, or the relocation of his mother and her new family.

    (ii)   The family life enjoyed between the Appellant  and  his  son  is
         significant  and  of  a  high  quality.  This  is  no  case  of   a
         substantially absent father, or a  father  who  has  only  awakened
         interest in contact with his son in the face of  possible  removal.
         From birth until May 2012 the Appellant and his son  were  part  of
         the same household. Since the separation of the  Appellant  and  Ms
         Monterisi there has been extensive contact between father and  son,
         and such  contact  now  continues  pursuant  to  court  order.  The
         Appellant and his son see each  other  virtually  every  day,  with
         father picking up from the mother's home to take his son to  school
         every  morning,  additional  contact  on  Wednesdays,  and  weekend
         staying contact on alternate weekends. I  also  take  into  account
         that it is more likely than not that the bond  between  father  and
         child has been particularly important and  significant  during  the
         period of the mother's establishing a  new  family,  and  yet  more
         particularly given the circumstances of her  mental  health  issues
         post-natally. The removal of the Appellant would destroy the nature
         of the family life between father and son and could not remotely be
         replicated by 'modern means of communication' or occasional visits.
         For a child coming to terms with the separation of his parents  and
         perhaps trying to understand his  place  within  his  mother's  new
         family  such  an   additional   disruption   would   likely   cause
         considerable upset and consternation.

    (iii)  I endorse the Judge's observations at paragraph 31 in respect of
         'best interests', but reach a more emphatic conclusion  than  there
         specified. In my judgement it is plainly in the  Appellant's  son's
         best interests that he maintain contact at a similar level  to  the
         current contact. In so concluding I recognise and acknowledge  that
         in  immigration  terms   'best   interests',   whilst   a   primary
         consideration, are not a paramount or determinative consideration.

27. I also take forward into my own analysis of Article 8 the comments  and
    observations in respect of Appendix FM above. On the face  of  it,  the
    only reason the Appellant might fail to satisfy the requirements of the
    Rules is by reference to the date of application.  In  so  far  as  the
    Rules only apply to circumstances where a child has been living in  the
    UK  for  seven   years,   they   do   not   otherwise   recognise   the
    unreasonableness of expecting the Appellant's son to leave the UK given
    his particular circumstances.

28. I take into  account  the  public  interest  in  maintaining  effective
    immigration control - and more particularly in  doing  so  through  the
    consistent and fair application of a published set  of  Rules.  I  also
    take into  account  that  the  Appellant  appears  to  have  become  an
    overstayer in 2001, and apparently made no attempt  to  regularise  his
    status until a previous EEA application was  made  in  July  2008.  His
    immigration history is not to his credit, and is an adverse  factor  in
    any proportionality balance. However, this circumstance is  ameliorated
    to some extent by the fact that the Appellant appears to have been self-
    supporting through work as a kitchen porter,  and  is  currently  self-
    supporting through work as a cleaner. Indeed in this context it  is  to
    be noted that he makes financial contributions to support his  son  out
    of his annual earnings of approximately �11,000.

29. I have noted the amendments to the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum
    Act 2002 introduced from 28 July 2014 by section 19 of the  Immigration
    Act 2014. It is a curiosity that the amended Part 5A does not apply  to
    EEA appeals brought under regulation 26 of the 2006 Regulations because
    Schedule 1 of those Regulations has not been amended and does not refer
    to the provisions in Part 5A.  Be  that  as  it  may,  given  that  the
    amendments  by  way  of  sections  117A-117D  set  out  in  effect  the
    Respondent's views -  and  in  turn  Parliament's  views  -  on  public
    interest considerations, it seems appropriate to have  regard  to  such
    considerations even where they might  not  have  the  direct  force  of
    application by statute. In doing so I remind myself  that  the  factors
    identified as relevant public considerations in Part 5A of the 2002 Act
    are not individually inevitably determinative of any  particular  case,
    and are not collectively an exhaustive list of relevant considerations.

30. Accordingly: as noted above  I  have  taken  into  account  the  public
    interest in the maintenance of effective immigration control (117B(1));
    I note that the Appellant speaks English (117B(2)); I  also  note  that
    the Appellant is financially independent (117B(3).  I  also  note  that
    little weight should be given to private life  established  at  a  time
    when a person is in the UK unlawfully or when his immigration status is
    precarious (117B(4) and (5)). The same is  not  stated  in  respect  of
    family life, and indeed where not  liable  to  deportation  the  public
    interest does not require removal if there is a genuine and  subsisting
    parental  relationship  with  a   qualifying   child   (117B(6)).   The
    Appellant's son is a qualifying child within  the  meaning  of  section
    117D(1).

31. On the very particular facts  of  this  case  it  seems  to  me  wholly
    uncontroversial to conclude that the first two Razgar questions  should
    be determined in the Appellant's favour: indeed I do not understand the
    Respondent to dispute as much. Further, there is no issue  between  the
    parties in respect of the third and fourth Razgar questions. In respect
    of proportionality, I am satisfied that notwithstanding the  imperative
    of maintaining effective immigration control, and the circumstances  of
    the Appellant's poor immigration history, given  that  otherwise  there
    are no countervailing factors by  reference  to  language  or  lack  of
    financial independence, the circumstances of the  Appellant's  son  and
    the very strong relationship between the Appellant and his son is  such
    as to tip the proportionality balance considerably  in  favour  of  the
    Appellant. In this regard, and for the avoidance of any doubt, I do not
    consider  that  the  Appellant's  and  his  son's   circumstances   are
    adequately reflected in the Rules, and I also conclude that the  nature
    of the father-son relationship in all  of  the  circumstances  of  this
    particular case  provides  a  compelling  reason  to  depart  from  the
    strictures of the Rules.

32. Accordingly I conclude that the removal of the Appellant in consequence
    of the Respondent's decision would be in breach of  both  his  and  his
    son's Article 8 rights.

Notice of Decision

33. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained a material  error  of
    law and is set aside in respect of the appeal on human rights grounds.

34. The  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  in  respect  of  the  EEA
    Regulations did not contain any error of law and stands.

35. I remake the decision in the appeal on human rights rounds. The  appeal
    is allowed.

36. No anonymity order is sought or made



Deputy Judge of the Upper Tribunal I. A. Lewis     20 May 2015
