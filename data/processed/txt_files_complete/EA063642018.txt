Representation:
For the Appellant: Ms Johnrose for the Appellant
For the Respondent: Mr Tan Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS
Introduction

 1. I have considered whether any parties  require  the  protection  of  an
    anonymity direction. No anonymity  direction  was  made  previously  in
    respect of this Appellant. Having considered all the circumstances  and
    evidence I do not consider it necessary to make an anonymity direction.

 2. This is an appeal by the Appellant against the decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge R Price promulgated on 11 February 2019, which dismissed
    the Appellant's appeal against a refusal of a residence card under  the
    EEA Regulations. The application was made for a residence card  as  the
    direct family member of a British citizen who had previously  exercised
    treaty rights in Malta and the  refusal  was  on  the  basis  that  the
    parties had not demonstrated that they genuinely relocated to Malta.

 3. Grounds of appeal were lodged by the Appellant in person summarised  in
    the grant of permission as the Judge construed the  treaty  rights  too
    narrowly and took into account irrelevant factors. On 25 February  2019
    First tier Tribunal Judge S H Smith gave permission to appeal.

 4. At the hearing I heard submissions from Ms Johnrose on  behalf  of  the
    Appellant that:

 5. In determining whether the Appellant met the requirements of Regulation
    9 the Judge found that the Appellant had failed to explain why they had
    moved to Malta when their purpose was implicit: they went there so that
    the Appellants wife could exercise her treaty right of free movement as
    she stated in the application form at 9.4

 6. The Judge took into account irrelevant  factors  such  as  whether  the
    employment she obtained was unique to Malta or whether they had friends
    or family there.

 7. She referred to the cases of Eind  C-291/05  and  O  &  B  C-456/12  to
    support her argument that the Regulations  are  intended  to  eliminate
    barrier to the exercise of free movement rights.  The  Judge  used  the
    Regulations to leapfrog European caselaw.

 8. She referred to those factors set out in the  caselaw  which  suggested
    that the move was genuine such as the length of residence, whether  the
    EEA national had a job and whether their family life  was  strengthened
    during the period of residence. These were also factors set out in  the
    Respondents own policy guidance. The Appellants  produced  evidence  of
    their registration with the Maltese authorities,  her  employment,  the
    child attended a nursery, that  they  had  signed  a  12  month  rental
    agreement, registered with a GP and opened a bank account and  none  of
    this evidence was referred to in the findings.

 9. The Judge did not identify in what way he asserted that  the  Appellant
    and his wife had artificially created the conditions that  appeared  to
    meet the Regulations.

10. On behalf of the Respondent Mr Tan submitted that:

11. The Appellants position appeared to be that she felt that  he  did  not
    have to give a reason for the move as he did not answer  Q9.53  in  the
    EEA application form.

12. The Judge was entitled to look at the reasons for the move to Malta and
    this should be a holistic assessment of all  of  the  evidence  in  the
    context of why they moved.

13. There is clearly a test of the genuine nature of the move  as  that  is
    set out in O & B.

14. Their recourse was a fresh fully completed application

15. In reply Ms Johnrose stated that their motivation was to exercise  free
    movement rights.

16. The Appellant produced evidence of all of the factors as set out in the
    Respondents own policy.

Finding on Material Error

17. Having heard those  submissions  I  reached  the  conclusion  that  the
    Tribunal made material errors of law.

18. This was an appeal against  a  refusal  of  a  Residence  card  by  the
    Appellant a Tunisian citizen. His application was based on  the  status
    of his wife, a British citizen, who lived with him in Tunisia and had a
    child and then the family moved to Malta where the Sponsor worked in  a
    hotel exercising treaty rights. The family lived in Malta for 6  months
    before taking a holiday in the UK  and  ultimately  returning  to  live
    there.

19. The Appellant is to some extent the author of  his  own  misfortune  in
    having his application refused in that both the case of O & B  and  the
    Regulations  require  that  the  relocation  is  'genuine'.   Thus   at
    paragraph 58 of O & B the Court held

         "It should be added that the scope of Union law cannot be  extended
         to cover abuses (see, to that effect, Case C-110/99  Emsland-Stï¿½rke
         [2000] ECR I-11569, paragraph 51, and Case C-303/08 Bozkurt  [2010]
         ECR I-13445, paragraph 47). Proof of such an abuse requires, first,
         a combination of objective circumstances in which,  despite  formal
         observance of the conditions laid down by the European Union rules,
         the purpose of those rules has not been achieved, and, secondly,  a
         subjective  element  consisting  in  the  intention  to  obtain  an
         advantage from the European Union rules  by  artificially  creating
         the conditions laid down for obtaining it (Case C-364/10 Hungary  v
         Slovakia [2012] ECR, paragraph 58)."


20. This requirement is found in Regulation 9 in this way

         "(4)     This regulation does not apply-

             (a) where the purpose of the residence in the EEA State was as
             a means for circumventing any immigration laws applying to non-
             EEA nationals to which F would otherwise be subject  (such  as
             any applicable requirement under the 1971 Act to have leave to
             enter or remain in the United Kingdom);"

21. A consideration of whether the move was genuine and was  not  motivated
    by a desire to secure an immigration advantage is  therefore,  to  some
    degree, addressed in the application form at questions  9.4  and  9.53.
    The Appellant states at 94 that she does not believe she is required to
    give a reason for the move as it was  done  in  the  exercise  of  free
    movement and where this question is asked 'What was the reason you went
    to live in the EEA state?' and it is not in dispute that the  Appellant
    left this question blank. I am not  persuaded  that  the  question  was
    answered as Ms  Johnrose  suggests  that  the  Sponsor  went  there  to
    exercise treaty rights as  I  am  satisfied  that  was  her  intention,
    something she had to establish in law before consideration  of  whether
    the move was genuine. Both EU law and the Regulations require the  move
    to be genuine and in so far as the motive may shed light on that it  is
    a matter that is part of the overall assessment

22. However I am persuaded that the reason behind the move was not the only
    evidence that the Judge was required to look at in determining  whether
    the move was genuine as the evidence had to be looked at in the  round.
    I am satisfied that the Judge erred in focusing  on  the  evidence  the
    Appellant did not produce (the reason for the  move)  rather  than  the
    evidence he did produce as there is no reference to any of  it  in  his
    findings.  The  Appellant  produced  exactly  the  sort   of   evidence
    (registration documents, long term lease,  medical  registration,  bank
    accounts, employment evidence) that was set out in Regulation 9(3)  and
    in the Respondents  guidance  and  there  is  no  engagement  with  the
    evidence that was before him. The Judge has also focused on integration
    of the family in Malta  rather  than  whether  their  own  family  life
    developed during the period of residence there.

23. The failure of the First-tier Tribunal to address and determine whether
    Regulation  9  was  met  on  the  basis  of  the  evidence  before  him
    constitutes a clear error of law. This error I consider to be  material
    since had the Tribunal conducted this exercise the outcome  could  have
    been different. That in my view is the correct test to apply

24. Under Part 3 paragraph 7.2(b) of the Upper Tribunal Practice  Statement
    of the 25th of September 2012 the case may be  remitted  to  the  First
    Tier Tribunal if the Upper Tribunal is satisfied that:

         (a)      the effect of the error has been to deprive a party before
         the First-tier Tribunal of a fair hearing or other opportunity  for
         that party's case to be put to and  considered  by  the  First-tier
         Tribunal; or


         (b)      the nature or extent of any judicial fact finding which is
         necessary in order for the decision in the appeal to be re-made  is
         such that, having regard to the overriding objective in rule 2,  it
         is appropriate to remit the case to the First-tier Tribunal.


25. In this case I have determined that the case should be remitted because
    the Appellant did not have a fair hearing due to the  failure  to  make
    findings in respect of the evidence that was before him.

26. I set aside the decision with no preserved findings for a  complete  re
    hearing. I remit the matter back to the First-tier Tribunal sitting  at
    Manchester to be heard on a date to be fixed before me.
