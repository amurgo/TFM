                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr S Whitwell, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

For the Respondent:    Mr R Abdar of Messrs Kesar & Co Solicitors


                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS

1.   The  Entry  clearance  Officer  appeals,  with  permission,  against  a
    decision  of  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Blake  who,  in   a
    determination promulgated on 4 February 2015,  allowed  the  appeal  of
    Miss Jesmin Akther against a decision of the  Entry  Clearance  Officer
    Dhaka made on 11 June 2013 to refuse her entry  clearance  to  come  to
    Britain as a spouse under  the  provisions  of  paragraph  EC-P.1.1  of
    Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.

2.   Although the Entry Clearance Officer is the appellant before me I  will
    for ease of reference refer to him as the  respondent  as  he  was  the
    respondent in the First-tier. Similarly I will  refer  to  Miss  Jesmin
    Akther as the appellant as she was the appellant in the First-tier.

3.   The appellant is married to  Mr  Muhammed  Rahman  who  is  settled  in
    Britain. The  reasons  for  refusal  were  that  the  English  language
    certificates in speaking and reading writing and listening provided  by
    the appellant were not accepted and secondly, that it was not  accepted
    that the appellant met the financial requirements of the Rules.

4.   At the hearing of the appeal before Judge Blake it  was  accepted  that
    the appellant's language certificates were adequate and therefore  that
    the only issue before him was that of whether or not the appellant  met
    the financial requirements of the Rules.

5.   The decision had been reviewed by the  Entry  Clearance  Manager  on  7
    July 2014. In his decision the Entry Clearance Officer wrote:-

         "The appellant stated that the sponsor was employed by Acha Hai Ltd
         since 01/08/2012 earning �13,000 per annum.  She  stated  that  the
         sponsor was also self-employed at the date  of  application  (which
         was 19/02/13) as a taxi driver earning �9,962 per annun.


         What the Entry Clearance Officer did not  make  clear  however  was
         that for self-employment, the appellant is required  to  show  that
         the sponsor was self-employed at the point of  application  and  in
         the last full financial year  received  self-employment  and  other
         income sufficient to meet the financial requirement  applicable  to
         the  application.  In  the  appellant's  case  therefore,  she  was
         required to show documents pertaining to  2011/2012  tax  year,  as
         well as evidence of continuing self-employment.


         In addition income from self-employment (Category F or Category  G)
         can  be  combined  with  income  from  salaried  and  non  salaried
         employment (category A) in order to meet the financial requirement.
          However, unlike other categories, these  sources  of  income  must
         fall with the same financial year(s) in order to be  included.  The
         appellant  has  combined  income  from  Category  F  for  tax  year
         2011/2012 with  income  under  Category  A  and  she  is  therefore
         required  or  show  the  combined  income  from  2011/29012.    The
         appellant started her salaried income in August 2012 and this  does
         not therefore  fall  within  the  relevant  tax  year.   The  Entry
         Clearance Officer was only therefore able  to  consider  the  self-
         employment for 2011/2012 tax year, and therefore only specified  in
         the bank statement evidencing this self-employment was missing.


         Whilst the appellant has  now  provided  bank  statements  for  the
         relevant time period, this does not demonstrate an income from self-
         employment of �1,8000 per annum or more for the relevant tax  year.
         The decision to  refuse  under  paragraph  EC.1.(d)  was  therefore
         correct."

6.   In the determination Judge Blake set out his findings in paragraphs  48
    onwards. He wrote:

         "50. I took into account paragraph E-ECP.1. I  noted  that  it  was
             submitted that the appellant had failed to  provide  specified
             documents in the form of a contract of  employment  from  Acha
             Hai Ltd and personal bank statement for the same twelve  month
             periods as the tax returns.


         51.      I took account of the fact that the sponsor had been self-
             employed working as  a  minicab  driver  since  May  2008.   I
             further noted that in addition to his self-employment  he  had
             taken a second salaried employment with Acha Hai  Ltd  from  1
             August 2012.


         52.  I note at the time of the application on 19 February 2013  the
             sponsor had been in that employment  for  six  months  as  was
             required by the Immigration Rules.


         53.  I further took into account that he  had  submitted  documents
             attesting his self-employment as well payslips in  respect  of
             this salaried employment. I found that the  combined  earnings
             from the two employments totalled in the region of �22,900.

         54.  I found that with an income of �22,962 per annum the appellant
             would meet the requirements of  Appendix  FM  as  it  exceeded
             threshold  of  �18,600  required  under   E-ECP.3.1(a)(i)   of
             Appendix FM.

         55.  I noted that  this  evidence  had  been  acknowledged  in  the
             refusal.


         56.  I considered the appellant's representative's submissions that
             the ECM had considered the wrong subparagraphs under the Rule.
             I noted that paragraph 13(f)  prohibited  the  combination  of
             self-employment income with specified  savings  and  paragraph
             13(g) applied to those  relying  on  income  other  than  from
             employment or self-employment.


         57.  I noted that the appellant was not relying on either  risk  of
             these subparagraphs.  I considered that the correct  reference
             to the Rules had to be a reference to  paragraph  13(e)  under
             Appendix FM-SE.


         58.  I found the ECM had erred in his understanding of subparagraph
             13(e).  I  accepted   the   submission   that   unlike   other
             subparagraphs  under  paragraph  13,   paragraph   13(e)   was
             freestanding, without reference to the other subparagraph.


         59.      I noted from the Rules attached to the appellant's bundle,
             paragraph 13 was considered. This stated in part as follows:

             "Calculating gross annual income under Appendix FM


             13.  Based on evidence that meets  the  requirements  of  this
                  Appendix, and can be taken into account with reference  to
                  the applicable provisions of  Appendix  FM,  gross  annual
                  income under paragraphs E-ECP.3.1., E-LTRP.3.1, E-ECC.2.1.
                  and E-LTR.C.1 will be calculated in the following ways:


                  (e)  Where a person is self-employed  their  gross  annual
                      income will be the total of their gross  income  from
                      their self-employment,  from  any  salaried  or  non-
                      salaried employment they have had or their partner as
                      had (if their partner is in the  with  permission  to
                      work), from specified non-employment income  received
                      by them or their partner, and from income from  a  UK
                      or  foreign  State  pension  or  a  private   pension
                      received by them or their partner, in the  last  full
                      financial years. The requirements  of  this  appendix
                      for specified evidence relating  to  these  forms  of
                      income shall apply as if reference s to the  date  of
                      application  were  references  to  the  end  of   the
                      relevant financial year(s).  The  relevant  financial
                      year(s) cannot be combined with any financial year(s)
                      to which paragraph 9 applies and vice versa. ..."

         60.   I  accepted  in  those  circumstances  that  paragraph  13(e)
             provided for a combination  of  self-employment  and  salaried
             income along with other combinations  in  order  to  meet  the
             requirements of the threshold of  �18,600  with  reference  to
             other subparagraphs.


         61.       I  accepted  the  submission  that  for  those  in  self-
             employment paragraph 13(e) allowed the option  of  relying  on
             one year's accounts, with evidence of  continuation  of  self-
             employment such as  bank  statements  or  relying  on  average
             earnings with reliance on two year's accounts.  I  found  that
             the Rules did not require any other permitted income  provided
             for under the same Rule to be of the same preceding  financial
             year.


         62.  In the circumstances I concluded the  ECM  had  erred  in  his
             interpretation and application of the Rules."

7.   The judge, having  allowed  the  appeal  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer
    appealed to the Upper Tribunal. The grounds of appeal stated  that  the
    judge had erred in taking into account  earnings  and  employment  from
    different periods and that paragraph 13(e) of  Appendix  FM-SE  clearly
    stated:

         "Where a person is self-employed, their gross annual income will be
         the total of their gross annual income from their  self-employment,
         from any salaried or non-salaried employment they have had (...) in
         the last full financial year or has an  average  of  the  last  two
         financial years."

8.   It was pointed out that as the appellant was relying on employment  and
    self- employment the evidence must be from the 2011/2012 tax  year  and
    demonstrate continuing self-employment at the date of application.  The
    grounds went on to state:-

         "5.  This point is fully made out in the Entry Clearance  Manager's
             review, as  it  .....  the  requirement  [sic]  for  the  bank
             statements to demonstrate  the  income  from  self  employment
             relevant  (the  last  four  financial)  year.  However  it  is
             submitted that the judge has erred in finding  that  this  was
             not required by the Immigration Rules. "

9.   At the hearing of the appeal before Mr Whitwell relied on  the  grounds
    of appeal. He pointed out that the last full financial year before  the
    date of application was that of April 2011 - March 2012.  He emphasised
    that the sponsor's contract for salaried  employment  had  begun  on  1
    August 2012 and that there was no salaried  employment  prior  to  that
    date.  The earnings for  self-employment  was  determined  to  be  only
    �9,962 for the period up to 5 April 2012.  He referred to paragraph  13
    of FM-SE which had been  reproduced by the judge in the  determination.
    He argued that the  judge  had  widened  the  scope  of  the  Rules  by
    interpreting that paragraph beyond what the Rules said. In  support  of
    that contention he referred to the Immigration Directorate Instructions
    at Section 4 which referred to how income from both salaried employment
    and self-employed employment could be combined to  meet  the  financial
    requirements of the Rules.

10.  In the Immigration Directorate Instructions, at paragraph 4.12 a  table
    sets out how the different sources of  income  could  be  combined.  He
    stated that it was made clear that  the  sponsor's  sources  of  income
    could be combined but "only for the period of  the  relevant  financial
    years".  He stated that the judge had conflated  the  guidance  of  the
    ways to satisfy the Rules and had not  properly  considered  the  exact
    terms of the IDIs.  While it was permissible to combine the two sources
    of income they had to be combined for the relevant period which was the
    financial year 2011/2012.  There was also  the  additional  requirement
    that for self-employed earnings it had to  be  shown  that  these  were
    being continued until the  date  of  application.  This  was  necessary
    because self-employed earnings required greater scrutiny.   He  pointed
    out that the sponsor's  earnings  from  employment  had  begun  shortly
    before the date of application in circumstances where at that stage the
    sponsor's bank account was overdrawn. He argued that  in  paragraph  61
    the judge had clearly erred when he stated:-

         "I found that the Rules  did  not  require  any  further  permitted
         income provided for under the same rule to be of the same preceding
         financial year."

11.  He referred further to the  IDIs at Section 9  which related  to  self-
    employed had stated that an average of income received  from  the  last
    two financial years could be used to fulfil the financial  requirements
    but pointed out that term related to income from self- employment.  The
    relevant section was Section  9.3.6  which  stated  that  income  under
    category FF (relating to self-employment) all sources  of  income  must
    fall within the financial years relied on and must still be a source of
    income at the time of application.

12.  Moreover he quoted from paragraph 9.3.9 which stated:-

         "Where a person in self-employment, or who is  the  director  of  a
         specified limited company in the UK, also  relies  on  income  from
         other employment (salaried or  non-salaried)  during  the  relevant
         financial year(s),  he  must  also  provided  evidence  of  ongoing
         employment (salaried or non-salaried) at the date of application."

13.  Finally he referred to paragraph 9.5.3 of the Rules which also set  out
    guidance for calculating self-employment which  emphasised  that  there
    should be evidence of ongoing self-employment.

14.  In reply Mr Abdar relied on the  Rule  24  response  in  which  he  had
    argued that the judge had not made any material error  of  law  in  the
    determination.  He stated in his response  that  at  the  time  of  the
    application the sponsor had been in  employment  for  over  six  months
    which was required by the Rules and that the submitted documents showed
    the sponsor's self-employment and also payslips for salaried employment
    being combined earnings of �22,962.  The  judge  had  been  correct  to
    accept that therefore the appellant met the requirements of the  Rules.



15.  He stated that the judge had found that  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer
    had erred in his  application  of  the  wrong  paragraphs  and  in  his
    application of paragraph 13(e) and that  that  paragraph  provided  the
    combination of self-employment and salaried income.  Again he  referred
    to the income of the sponsor as at the date of application.

16.  It was his further argument that as  it  was  only  evidence  of  self-
    employment continuing that had to be shown,  this  would  throw  up  an
    anomaly in circumstances where evidence of self-employment required  to
    be shown but in fact an applicant had no salaried employment.   It  was
    his view that therefore the Rules  could  not  have  envisaged  such  a
    scenario and therefore that the interpretation placed by Judge Blake on
    the evidence before him was valid.

17.  In his skeleton argument he also argued that should an error of law  be
    found there would require to be further evidence  before  the  Tribunal
    and therefore an adjournment would be required.

18.  In his oral submissions he amplified the arguments  which  he  had  put
    forward in the Rule 24 notice and again emphasised  what  he  indicated
    was the absurdity of the interpretation of the Rules put forward in the
    Entry Clearance Manager's decision to maintain the refusal and  in  the
    grounds of appeal to the Upper Tribunal.   He  argued  that  there  was
    potential unfairness in the  interpretation  that  was  now  being  put
    forward  and  with  that  in  mind  I  should   endorse   the   judge's
    interpretation of the Rules.

19.   In  response,  Mr  Whitwell  referred  to  the   relevant   evidential
    requirements in the Rules.

Discussion

20.  I consider that there is a material error of law in  the  determination
    of the judge.  There is, I consider, a clear reason for the requirement
    to show the continuing income from self-employed, beyond  the  relevant
    tax year because of the vagaries of such income.

21.  The reality is that by  relying  on  the  income  from  employment  and
    indeed for self-employment during the tax year, it is  far  easier  for
    the respondent to be sure that the income is actually available for the
    support of the spouse.

22.  I find that in paragraph 61 of the determination  the  judge,  when  he
    stated that the Rules  do   not  require  any  other  permitted  income
    provided for under the Rules to be of the same preceding financial year
    was actually doing a violence  to  the  terms  of  paragraph  13(e)  of
    Appendix FM-SE which dealt with the issue  of  self-employment.   I  am
    fortified by that decision when I consider the terms of the IDIs and in
    particular Section 9 which deals with the issue of self-employment.

23.   Having  found  that  there  is  a  material  error  of  law   in   the
    determination of the judge I set aside  his  determination.   I  direct
    that the appeal proceed to a hearing afresh  in  the  First-tier  as  I
    consider that the terms of the Senior President of Tribunals Directions
    are met as further evidence would be required.  Mr Abdar will no  doubt
    wish to consider with his client  whether  or  not  it  would  be  more
    efficacious for him to make a fresh  application  relying  on  evidence
    which can now be produced for the relevant financial years.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Judge is set aside.

Direction.

The appeal will proceed to a hearing afresh  in  the  First-tier  at  Taylor
    House. Time estimate 2 hours, no interpreter
