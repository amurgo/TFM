For the Respondent:    Mr Ian Jarvis, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 (SI 2008/2698) I make  an  order  prohibiting  the  disclosure  or
    publication of any matter likely to  lead  members  of  the  public  to
    identify the appellant. Breach of this  order  can  be  punished  as  a
    contempt of court. I make the order because the appellant  is  a  young
    asylum seeker who might be at risk just by reason of being identified.

 2. The appellant appeals against the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    dismissing the appellant's appeal on asylum and  human  rights  grounds
    against a decision taken on 29 April 2014 refusing to grant him  asylum
    and to remove him from the UK.

Introduction

 3. The appellant claims to be a citizen of Somalia born in 1988. He claims
    to be a member of the  minority  Ashraf  Reer  Hamar  ethnic  group  in
    Somalia. His father owned a shop which was  repeatedly  raided  by  the
    Hawiye clan militia and in 1997 the father  was  killed  by  them.  The
    appellant and his mother then moved with his sister to  Luuq.  He  then
    attended a Quranic school from 1998. His mother was killed in  2000  by
    Hawiye clan militia. His cousin, J, took him in.  After  two  weeks  he
    organised for the appellant to travel to  Mombasa.  He  then  lived  in
    Kenya for eight years and attended a mosque school  with  other  Somali
    children.

 4. The appellant claims that he left Kenya in 2008 after  Jama  had  saved
    $5000 to pay an agent. In July 2008 the appellant  travelled  by  lorry
    from Kenya to Tanzania to the British embassy in Dar es Salaam. He  was
    fingerprinted but not interviewed and believes that he was issued  with
    some form of UK visa. He travelled by plane to the UK via  Ethiopia  in
    August 2008. He then lived and worked for the agent in the UK for three
    years in East London, earning �10-�20 per week. In 2011 he was taken to
    Bristol to work.

 5. Around August 2012 the appellant lost his job and the  agent  told  him
    that he could no longer support him. The appellant  approached  members
    of the Somali community and they helped him to find a cousin in the UK,
    S. S has been accepted as a Somali national  of  Ashraf  ethnicity  and
    granted refugee status. He helped the appellant to claim asylum  on  29
    October 2012.

 6. The respondent accepted that the appellant spoke Somali  but  he  is  a
    match to a visa issued as a citizen of Tanzania which means that during
    the visa application he was  accepted  as  a  citizen  of  Tanzania.  A
    language analysis conducted by Sprakab found that the appellant did not
    speak any variety of Somali  spoken  in  south  Somalia.  He  also  had
    incorrect  and  non-detailed  knowledge  of  Luuq  and   Somalia.   The
    respondent did not accept that the appellant was a citizen  of  Somalia
    and has issued removal directions for Tanzania.

The Appeal

 7. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal and attended an  oral
    hearing at Taylor House on 21 January 2015.  The  judge  dismissed  his
    appeal, making a series of adverse  credibility  findings  and  relying
    upon the  Sprakab  evidence.  There  was  no  documentary  evidence  to
    corroborate S's claim to be the appellant's paternal cousin.

The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

 8. The appellant sought permission to appeal on 10 March 2015.  A DNA test
    was included in the appellant's bundle before the First-tier  tribunal,
    showing that there was a 99.92% probability that S  and  the  appellant
    were paternal cousins.  The judge's findings regarding the  reliability
    of S's evidence were unsafe and should be set aside.

 9. Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Blum on 28 May
    2015 on the basis that it appeared that the judge  failed  to  consider
    the DNA evidence which strongly suggested  the  appellant  and  S  were
    indeed cousins. It was arguable that had the judge taken account of the
    DNA evidence then she  may  have  reached  a  different  conclusion  in
    respect of the appellant's nationality.

10. In a rule 24 response dated 10 June  2015,  the  respondent  sought  to
    uphold the judge's decision on the basis that the DNA evidence was  not
    capable of providing proof of the appellant's nationality, particularly
    in light of the numerous findings on that matter. The relationship  was
    not a crucial finding and consideration of the  DNA  evidence  was  not
    capable of changing the outcome of the appeal.

11. Thus, the appeal came before me.

Discussion

12. Ms Thirumaney submitted that the two key points were the  DNA  evidence
    and the undue weight attached to the Sprakab report. The appellant is a
    Somali national and the reference to an absence of documentary evidence
    to prove the  claimed  paternal  cousin  relationship  means  that  the
    assessment of an important part of the claim  is  fundamentally  flawed
    and that is a material error of law. The Tribunal should  not  use  the
    Sprakab report to pre-judge the case. The basis at paragraph 25 of  the
    decision is solely on the Sprakab report to find that the appellant  is
    not a Somali national. Undue weight was placed on  the  Sprakab  report
    which clouded the judge's considerations to the extent that she did not
    even notice the DNA evidence. There was an error on key matters and the
    decision is not sustainable.

13. Mr Jarvis submitted  that  there  is  a  raft  of  adverse  credibility
    findings in the decision, not just reliance on the Sprakab report.  The
    appellant relied upon the Tanzanian passport and the judge was entitled
    to make findings about that. The appellant has had the  opportunity  to
    rebut the assertions  in  the  Sprakab  report  by  way  of  background
    evidence but has chosen not to do so.  Permission  to  appeal  was  not
    granted in relation to the rejection of Dr Mullen's evidence  submitted
    on behalf of the appellant. The DNA evidence is a red  herring  because
    most people  have  relatives  of  a  different  nationality.  The  real
    question is why the appellant had a Tanzanian passport  and  the  judge
    rejected his  explanation.  Paragraph  27  of  the  decision  carefully
    assesses the evidence of Said. At  its  highest,  the  absence  of  any
    reference to the DNA evidence is not material; it is almost  inevitable
    that the appellant as an ethnic Somali would  have  a  Somali  national
    relative.

14. Ms Thirumaney replied that the judge was clouded by the Sprakab  report
    and then failed to take into account other material  evidence.  If  the
    judge had opened her mind to the DNA evidence then the outcome  of  the
    nationality assessment  might  have  been  different.  The  appellant's
    explanation about the Tanzanian passport was  dismissed  in  a  cursory
    way.

15. I find that Upper Tribunal Judge  Blum  did  not  grant  permission  to
    appeal in relation to the  ground  that  the  judge  erred  in  law  by
    attaching less weight to an expert report from Dr Mullen  dealing  with
    the appellant's nationality because Dr Mullen conducted  his  interview
    over the telephone whereas the Sprakab report was also  conducted  over
    the telephone. In fact, the judge gave  cogent  reasons  for  attaching
    less weight to the report from Dr Mullen and no material error  of  law
    arises from the judge's handling of the expert evidence. Permission  to
    appeal would not  have  been  granted  at  all  were  it  not  for  the
    overlooked DNA evidence. That does not mean that the judge's assessment
    of the expert evidence would not have been wholly different if the  DNA
    evidence had been properly considered.

16. I reject Mr Jarvis' submission that the DNA  evidence  could  not  have
    altered the outcome of the appeal  and  therefore  any  error  was  not
    material. The DNA evidence proves that  a  significant  aspect  of  the
    appellant's account is true; i.e. that he and S are  paternal  cousins.
    This is a case involving delicate considerations of competing evidence.
    The judge found that the  appellant  used  what  was  regarded  by  the
    British embassy as a genuine Tanzanian passport issued to him  in  2005
    (paragraph 21 of the decision), gave vague answers  during  his  asylum
    interview relating to why he failed to leave  Kenya  earlier  when  the
    passport he  travelled  on  was  issued  in  2005  (paragraph  21)  and
    displayed little knowledge of Luuq where he claimed to live and Somalia
    in general (Sprakab report, paragraph 25)  and  spoke  Somali  with  an
    accent and grammar found in Kenya,  Tanzania  and  Uganda  rather  than
    Somalia (paragraph 25).

17. The judge reinforced those negative findings by placing limited  weight
    on the expert report from Dr  Mullen  (paragraph  26)  and  stating  at
    paragraph 26 that, "Despite the appellant's claim that he is the  first
    cousin  of  (S),  a  Somali  citizen,  both  witnesses  had  distinctly
    different racial  features.  (S)  said  that  the  reason  they  looked
    different is because their fathers who he claimed  were  brothers  also
    looked different ... I attach limited weight to his evidence which I do
    not find credible. I find that he has attempted to convey the appellant
    as a Somali national to support his  claim  for  asylum.  There  is  no
    documentary evidence  to  support  his  claim  to  be  the  appellant's
    paternal cousin". The basis of the finding that S was  not  a  credible
    witness falls away in light of the DNA evidence and  I  find  that  the
    actual relationship between S and the  appellant  is  critical  to  the
    appellant's case.  Despite  the  valiant  efforts  of  Mr  Jarvis,  the
    respondent's case and the judge's findings have never been made on  the
    basis that the appellant and S were paternal  first  cousins  who  were
    somehow brought up in different countries. I find that the  inadvertent
    failure to consider the DNA evidence is a material error of  law  which
    has prevented the judge from properly balancing the competing  evidence
    in this case.

18. I have considered paragraph 51 of SSHD v MN & KY [2014] UKSC 30.  There
    is no reason in principal why Sprakab should not be able to  report  on
    both (a) language as evidence of place of origin  and  (b)  familiarity
    with claimed place of origin provided in both cases, their expertise is
    properly  demonstrated  and  their  reasoning   adequately   explained.
    Acceptable expertise and method can properly  be  accepted  unless  the
    evidence in a particular case shows otherwise. The  tribunal  ought  to
    give further consideration  to  how  the  basis  for  the  geographical
    attribution of particular dialects or usages can  be  better  explained
    and not be left implicit. The tribunal needs  to  be  able  to  satisfy
    itself as to the data by reference to which analysts make judgments  on
    the geographical range of a particular dialect or usage. In relation to
    familiarity, the report needs to explain the source and nature  of  the
    knowledge of the analyst on which the comments are based  and  identify
    the error  or  lack  of  expected  knowledge  found  in  the  interview
    material.

19. It is clear that the weight given to Sprakab reports must be  carefully
    assessed on a case by case basis and that process may be influenced  by
    other evidence, such as the DNA evidence in this case.  The  fact  that
    the judge gave cogent reasons for preferring the  Sprakab  report  from
    the expert report of Dr Mullen is not decisive. The material  error  of
    law in this case infects the whole of the decision including the weight
    to be placed upon  competing  expert  evidence.  Thus,  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's decision to dismiss  the  appellant's  appeal  involved  the
    making of errors of law and its decision cannot stand.

Decision

20. Both representatives invited me to order a rehearing in the  First-tier
    Tribunal if I set aside the judge's decision and took the view that the
    DNA evidence went to the heart of the case. Bearing in  mind  paragraph
    7.2 of the Senior President's Practice Statements I  consider  that  an
    appropriate course of action. I find that the errors of law infect  the
    decision as a whole and therefore the re-hearing will be de  novo  with
    all issues to be considered again by the First-tier Tribunal.

21. Consequently, I set aside the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal.  I
    order the appeal to be heard again in the  First-Tier  Tribunal  to  be
    determined de novo by a judge other than the previous First-tier judge.
