Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms A Everett, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr N O'Brien, Counsel


                            DECISION AND REASONS


    1. In this case it is the Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department
       who has appealed against the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
       allowing the appeal on article 8 grounds of Mr Adnan  Tariq.  As  Mr
       Adnan Tariq was the appellant before the First-tier Tribunal  it  is
       more convenient to continue to refer to him as "the  appellant"  and
       to the Secretary of State as "the respondent".


    2. The appellant entered the UK as long ago as January 2007,  initially
       with leave as a student. He overstayed his  leave  and,  in  January
       2012, claimed asylum on the basis that  he  was  at  risk  from  the
       family of S with whom he had been in  an  extramarital  relationship
       while in Pakistan. He also claimed he had subsequently married  her.
       However, his application was refused and his appeal  to  the  First-
       tier Tribunal dismissed. The First-tier  Tribunal  judge  found  the
       appellant's account was not credible  and,  although  the  appellant
       appeared to have been severely injured at some point in the past, he
       found his injuries were not the result of an attack by S's family.


    3. The  appellant  subsequently  became  appeal  rights  exhausted.  In
       September 2014 he made further submissions which led to the decision
       under appeal, dated 30 March 2017. The reasons  for  refusal  letter
       maintained the refusal of  the  protection  claim,  relying  on  the
       findings of the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  also  pointing  out  the
       appellant could  receive  a  sufficiency  of  protection  and  could
       exercise an internal flight alternative in Pakistan.

    4. The refusal also considered whether  removing  the  appellant  would
       breach article 8 of the Human Rights Convention. The  appellant  now
       claimed to be in a relationship akin  to  marriage  with  a  British
       citizen, Ms Moorghen. At the time of the decision, she did not  fall
       within the definition of 'partner' provided by Appendix  FM  of  the
       rules  and,  in  any  event,  the  respondent  considered  that  the
       appellant could not meet the requirements of paragraph EX.1  of  the
       rules.

    5. The appellant appealed against the decision. At the  hearing  before
       the First-tier Tribunal, held on 15 June 2017 at Hatton  Cross,  the
       appellant's counsel confirmed that the appeal was  only  pursued  on
       article 8 grounds, even though the appellant had maintained  in  his
       witness statement that he was still at risk from S's family  and  Ms
       Moorghen expressed her fears on this score in hers.  The  First-tier
       Tribunal Judge therefore treated the asylum  claim  as  having  been
       abandoned. The judge heard oral evidence from the appellant and  his
       partner and found the relationship was genuine  and  subsisting.  In
       paragraph 22 of his decision he set out his key findings as follows:

         "The appellant's article 8 claim rests on his relationship with his
         new  partner.  I  accept  that  the  relationship  is  genuine  and
         subsisting. They have been through a religious  ceremony  and  have
         tried to register their union civilly. They have now cohabited  for
         well over 2� years. He has integrated  with  her  family.  If  they
         return together to make a new application for entry  clearance  she
         will lose her employment and her ability to satisfy  the  financial
         requirement for his sponsorship. Even if she were able to  overcome
         the financial problem, the process might be lengthy  and  I  accept
         the reasons why it would be onerous on her  to  live  in  Pakistan,
         where she speaks very little of the  local  language.  Her  parents
         would not be able to keep up with the mortgage payments without her
         contribution. If, on the other hand, the appellant were  to  return
         alone to renew his  application,  I  can  see  no  reason  why  the
         application might fail. Any consideration of his application  under
         the rules would be defeated because at the date of  application  of
         the current claim they had not been living together for two  years,
         but I have to consider the human rights position as of the date  of
         hearing.  "Exceptional  circumstances"   warranting   consideration
         outside the rules have recently been considered in  R  (Agyarko)  v
         SSHD [2017] UKSC 11, where the principle involved  in  Chikwamba  v
         SSHD [2008] UKHL 40 was upheld. I find  that  it  applies  in  this
         case. I have also borne in  mind  the  rights  of  the  appellant's
         British partner and of her parents. Whereas she can  be  criticised
         for conniving in his unlawful status, her  parents  were  presented
         with a fait accompli. I find this has become a  close  family  unit
         which extends beyond the appellant and his  partner.  Even  if  the
         removal of the appellant would be in accordance with the law I find
         that, in the light of the  principle  in  Chikwamba,  it  would  be
         disproportionate to the public interest in the maintenance of  fair
         but firm immigration [control]."

    6. The respondent sought permission to appeal on two grounds.  Firstly,
       it was submitted that the First-tier Tribunal Judge  had  failed  to
       conduct an adequate balancing exercise in that he had not taken into
       account the appellant's poor immigration history. In particular,  he
       had made no reference at all to the impact of section 117B(4) of the
       2002 Act. Secondly, the grounds argued that the First-tier  Tribunal
       Judge had failed to identify insurmountable obstacles to family life
       being continued in Pakistan. The matters relied on by the  judge  in
       this respect were merely matters of preference.


    7. Permission to appeal was granted by the First-tier Tribunal  because
       it was arguable the judge's failure to have regard to  section  117B
       involved an error of law which might have made a material difference
       to outcome.

    8. I heard submissions from the representatives as to whether the First-
       tier Tribunal Judge had made an error of law  in  his  decision.  In
       brief,  Ms  Everett  argued  the  judge's  balancing  exercise   was
       inadequate,  including  with  respect  to  Chikwamba.  Outling   the
       appellant's immigration history at the beginning of the decision was
       not sufficient to show he had balanced the appellant's case  against
       the public  interest.  She  argued  that  the  judge's  approach  to
       Chikwamba involved a misdirection of  law.   The  principle  applied
       where the only point on the side of the public interest was that the
       appellant should go back to apply for entry clearance.  It  was  not
       clear the appellant would succeed in an application.

    9. Ms Everett argued that the judge had applied a test lower  than  the
       insurmountable obstacles threshold,  namely  onerousness.  The  only
       difficulties identified were Ms Moorghen's language difficulties and
       her parents' mortgage repayments. That was not enough  to  meet  the
       legal test.

   10. She argued it was an error in this case  not  to  have  applied  the
       provisions of section 117B. She accepted  that  it  was  a  test  of
       substance over form, in line with Dube  (ss.117A-117D)  [2015]  UKUT
       00090 (IAC). However, it was not apparent that  the  judge  in  this
       case had applied the section.

   11.  Mr  O'Brien  handed  in  a  brief  rule  24  response  and  outline
       submission. He built on these arguments and replied to Ms  Everett's
       submissions. Firstly, he  suggested  Ms  Everett's  submission  that
       Chikwamba had been  wrongly  applied  was  not  a  matter  on  which
       permission to appeal had been granted. It had  not  previously  been
       challenged and the judge's decision on it should be left untouched.

   12. Mr O'Brien disagreed with Ms Everett that the judge  had  applied  a
       test of onerousness, being less stringent than the correct  test  of
       insurmountable obstacles. In any  event,  the  judge  had  correctly
       directed himself in terms of Agyarko and it was legitimate  to  look
       for  very  compelling  circumstances  why  removal  might   not   be
       proportionate, even in a case of precarious family life.

   13. Mr O'Brien said it was  clear  from  paragraph  22  of  the  judge's
       decision  that  he  was  searching  for  exceptional  circumstances.
       Chikwamba was such a case and the judge was entitled  to  find  this
       factor tipped the balance in the appellant's favour. He was right to
       look at the impact on all family members in  line  with  Beoku-Betts
       [2008] UKHL 39. In terms of the public interest, the judge expressly
       referred to Ms Moorghen conniving in the appellant's lawful  status,
       which showed he had had the appellant's history in mind. The judge's
       reasoning was concise but sufficient.

   14. As for the absence of any mention of  section  117B,  there  was  no
       requirement to make explicit reference to it provided  it  had  been
       applied in substance (Dube). In  any  event,  the  section  did  not
       mandate any particular outcome (see paragraph 49 of Rhuppiah v  SSHD
       [2016] EWCA Civ 803 per Sales LJ). The presence of  very  compelling
       circumstances will prevail, as shown by Agyarko.

   15. Ms Everett disagreed that, had the judge made express  reference  to
       section 117B, it could be assumed his decision would  have  remained
       the same.

   16. The representatives were in agreement that, if I found an  error  of
       law and set aside the decision, the preferable course was to  remake
       the decision myself. The representatives had made their  submissions
       in addressing the First-tier Tribunal's decision. There were no  new
       factual matters save for the fact  the  couple  had  married  on  23
       August 2017. I was shown the marriage certificate.

Error of law?
   17. Having carefully read the decision and considered the arguments  put
       forward by the representatives I have concluded that the decision of
       the First-tier Tribunal contains material errors of law such that it
       must be set aside. My reasons are as follows.


   18. It is common ground in this case that the relationship  between  the
       appellant and Ms Moorghen, which the appellant claims  began  around
       August 2012 and led to cohabitation since  October  2014,  has  been
       established at a time the appellant was without leave.  He  made  no
       mention of Ms Moorghen at his previous appeal hearing in April 2013.
       His last grant of leave had expired in May  2009.  His  relationship
       with Ms Moorghen was disclosed to the respondent as a fait  accompli
       in his representations of September 2013.


   19. The correct approach to article 8 in cases of precarious family life
       was the subject of definitive guidance in the judgment of Lord  Reed
       in Agyarko. In paragraph 49 of his judgment, Lord Reed explained the
       significance of this factor as follows:

         "In Jeunesse , the Grand Chamber said,  consistently  with  earlier
         judgments of  the  court,  that  an  important  consideration  when
         assessing the proportionality under article 8 of the removal of non
         - settled migrants from a contracting  state  in  which  they  have
         family members, is whether family life was created at a  time  when
         the persons involved were aware that the immigration status of  one
         of them was such that the persistence of that  family  life  within
         the host state would from the outset be "precarious". Where this is
         the case, the court said, "it is likely only to be  in  exceptional
         circumstances that the removal of the non - national family  member
         will constitute a violation of article 8" (para 108)."
   20. Lord Reed explained that the test of  insurmountable  obstacles,  as
       used in paragraph EX.1 of Appendix FM of the rules and later defined
       in paragraph EX.2, was taken from the jurisprudence of the ECtHR. In
       paragraph 33 he cited  with  approval  Sales  LJ  in  the  Court  of
       Appeal's judgment that,


         "[i]t imposed a stringent  test,  illustrated  by  Jeunesse  v  The
         Netherlands (2015) 60 EHRR 17, para 117, where the court found that
         there were no insurmountable obstacles to the applicant'  s  family
         settling in Suriname, although they would experience  a  degree  of
         hardship if forced to do so. It was to be interpreted, both in  the
         European case law and in the Rules, in  a  sensible  and  practical
         rather than a purely literal way."


   21. However, as Mr O'Brien said, the test  of  insurmountable  obstacles
       was not the end of the matter. Lord Reed:
         "42. In Jeunesse, the Grand Chamber identified,  consistently  with
         earlier judgments of the court, a number of  factors  to  be  taken
         into account in assessing the proportionality under  article  8  of
         the removal of non - settled migrants from a contracting  state  in
         which they have family  members.  Relevant  factors  were  said  to
         include the extent  to  which  family  life  would  effectively  be
         ruptured, the extent of the ties in the contracting state,  whether
         there were "insurmountable obstacles" in  the  way  of  the  family
         living in the country of origin of the non  -  national  concerned,
         and whether there were factors of immigration control (for example,
         a history of breaches of  immigration  law)  or  considerations  of
         public order weighing in favour of exclusion (para 107).
         43.  It  appears  that  the  European  court  intends   the   words
         "insurmountable obstacles" to be  understood  in  a  practical  and
         realistic sense, rather than as referring solely to obstacles which
         make it literally impossible for the family to live together in the
         country of origin of the non - national concerned. In  some  cases,
         the court has used other expressions which make that  clearer:  for
         example, referring to "un obstacle majeur" (Sen v  The  Netherlands
         (2003) 36 EHRR 7, para 40), or to "major  impediments"  (Tuquabo  -
         Tekle v The Netherlands [2006] 1 FLR 798 , para  48),  or  to  "the
         test of ' insurmountable obstacles' or 'major impediments'" ( IAA v
         United Kingdom (2016) 62 EHRR SE 19, paras 40 and  44),  or  asking
         itself whether the family could "realistically" be expected to move
         (Sezen  v  The  Netherlands  (2006)   43   EHRR   30,   para   47).
         "Insurmountable obstacles" is, however, the expression employed  by
         the Grand Chamber; and the court's application of it indicates that
         it is a stringent test. In Jeunesse, for example, there  were  said
         to be no insurmountable obstacles to the relocation of  the  family
         to Suriname, although the children,  the  eldest  of  whom  was  at
         secondary school, were Dutch nationals  who  had  lived  there  all
         their lives, had never visited Suriname,  and  would  experience  a
         degree of hardship if forced to move, and the  applicant's  partner
         was in full - time employment in the Netherlands: see paras 117 and
         119."
   22. As to the general approach to be taken, Lord Reed  referred  to  the
       leading authorities  on  deportation  and  article  8  and  said  as
       follows:
         "57. That approach is also appropriate when a court or tribunal  is
         considering whether a refusal of leave to remain is compatible with
         article 8 in the context of precarious family life. Ultimately,  it
         has  to  decide  whether  the  refusal  is  proportionate  in   the
         particular case before it, balancing the  strength  of  the  public
         interest in the removal of  the  person  in  question  against  the
         impact on private and family life. In  doing  so,  it  should  give
         appropriate weight to the Secretary of State's policy, expressed in
         the Rules  and  the  Instructions,  that  the  public  interest  in
         immigration  control  can  be  outweighed,  when   considering   an
         application for leave to remain brought by a person in  the  UK  in
         breach of immigration laws, only where  there  are  "insurmountable
         obstacles" or "exceptional circumstances" as defined. It must  also
         consider all factors relevant to the  specific  case  in  question,
         including, where relevant, the matters discussed in paras 51  -  52
         above. The critical issue will generally  be  whether,  giving  due
         weight to the strength of the public interest in the removal of the
         person in the case before it, the article 8 claim  is  sufficiently
         strong  to  outweigh  it.  In  general,  in  cases  concerned  with
         precarious family life,  a  very  strong  or  compelling  claim  is
         required to outweigh the public interest in immigration control."
   23. Returning to paragraph 22 of the judge's decision, it was  incumbent
       on the judge to follow  a  structured  approach.  The  existence  of
       valuable family life was accepted and the  determinative  issue  was
       the proportionality of removing the  appellant  notwithstanding  the
       fact the appellant enjoys a genuine and subsisting relationship with
       a British citizen.


   24. It is  not  possible  to  find  within  the  judge's  reasoning  any
       reference to the importance of the public  interest  in  maintaining
       immigration controls. The appellant has, by any  standards,  a  poor
       immigration history. Having come  to  the  UK  in  order  to  pursue
       studies, which he  did  for  around  two  years,  he  remained  here
       unlawfully as an overstayer and then pursued what turned out  to  be
       an unmeritorious asylum claim,  which  was  rejected  at  his  first
       appeal and which he abandoned at his second appeal. He  had  resided
       in the UK for 10� years by the date of the hearing in the First-tier
       Tribunal but he had only had leave to remain in the UK for a  period
       of a little over two years.

   25. Of course, I accept the judge was fully aware of  this  history.  He
       set it out in paragraphs 1 to 5 of his decision. However, this  does
       not mean that it is clear from paragraph 22 that the  judge  weighed
       the  public  interest  in  removing  overstayers  in  the  balancing
       exercise. With the exception of the single reference to Ms  Moorghen
       conniving in the appellant's  unlawful  status,  he  only  sets  out
       matters favourable to the appellant. That reference to  Ms  Moorghen
       was in the context of the application of  the  Chikwamba  principle,
       which I shall come to. It  cannot  seriously  be  argued  that  this
       reference  was  shorthand  for  giving  weight  to  the  appellant's
       deliberate flouting of the law. Nor does it begin to show the  judge
       took account  of  the  fact  the  relationship  was  formed  in  the
       knowledge that the appellant was living in  the  UK  unlawfully  and
       could therefore be expected to leave the UK. The  judge  appears  to
       have  given  predominant  weight  to  the  relationship  which   the
       appellant  enjoys  with  his   British   citizen   partner   without
       recognising that he was required by statute  to  reduce  the  weight
       which could be given to that factor.

   26. When it came to assessing the key question  of  whether  there  were
       insurmountable obstacles to family life being pursued  in  Pakistan,
       the First-tier Tribunal Judge identified the reasons, including  the
       need for Ms Moorghen to remain  in  employment  so  that  she  could
       assist her parents to meet their mortgage commitments.  The  meaning
       of insurmountable obstacles was made clear by Lord Reed  in  Agyarko
       and it was previously considered extensively in the Court of  Appeal
       ([2015] EWCA Civ 440).  Sales  LJ  had  explained  that  the  phrase
       "insurmountable obstacles" imposes a high hurdle  and  the  test  is
       significantly more demanding than a mere test of whether it would be
       reasonable to expect a couple to continue their family life  outside
       the UK.

   27. The two issues relied on by the  judge,  namely  Ms  Moorghen's  few
       words of Urdu and the need to contribute to  her  parents'  mortgage
       repayments, do not come close to showing the high threshold  of  the
       test had been reached and I find he did not direct himself correctly
       on this point notwithstanding the citation of Agyarko.

   28. I am conscious the appellant conceded in this case he could not meet
       the requirements of Appendix FM. I understand that was  because  the
       appellant and Ms Moorghen had not lived together for  two  years  by
       the date of application, although they had by the date  of  hearing.
       As seen, the test of insurmountable obstacles was drawn  from  ECtHR
       case law and Appendix FM did not apply a higher  or  more  demanding
       test. This was still a matter the judge was required to consider  in
       line with the authorities.

   29. A further error of law was the failure to have regard to the factors
       listed in section 117B of the 2002 Act when considering  the  public
       interest, as the judge was required  to  do  by  virtue  of  section
       117A(2). As explained by Sales LJ in Rhuppiah, Part 5A  of  the  Act
       was intended to provide for a structured approach to the application
       of article 8 which would produce in all cases a final  result  which
       was compatible with article 8 (see paragraph 45).  However,  it  was
       common ground in that case that it was possible to conceive of cases
       caught by sections 117B(4) and (5) in which a private or family life
       of an especially strong kind  had  been  established  such  that  it
       should be accorded great weight (see paragraph 46).  However,  where
       Parliament has declared that something is  in  the  public  interest
       that is definitive as to that aspect of  the  public  interest  (see
       paragraph 49). It  might  still  be  outweighed  by  other  relevant
       considerations (see paragraph 53) but,

         "[i]n order to identify an exceptional case in  which  a  departure
         from that approach would be  justified,  compelling  reasons  would
         have to be shown..." (paragraph 54)

   30. Not only is paragraph 22 of the judge's decision silent  as  regards
       the factors set out in section 117B but it is not  possible  to  see
       that he has implicitly considered them and carried out a  structured
       assessment giving weight to Parliament's  assessment  of  where  the
       public interest lies. It may be  possible  to  say  that  the  judge
       acknowledged that the appellant could speak English and was able  to
       work such that the factors in section  117B(2)  and  (3)  would  not
       weigh against the appellant. However, such findings would not  weigh
       in his favour; they would be neutral factors. The key issue was  the
       application of section 117B(4) and it is not possible  to  see  that
       the judge recognised that little  weight  should  be  given  to  the
       appellant's family life.


   31. Mr O'Brien argued  that  this  did  not  matter  because  the  judge
       identified very compelling  circumstances  to  outweigh  the  public
       interest in any event. However, before doing so, it was incumbent on
       the judge to show he had given great weight to the public  interest.
       I find this was a material error of law.

   32. I now turn to the Chikwamba point which Mr O'Brien argued the  judge
       was entitled to deploy in this case so as to find the scales  tipped
       in the appellant's favour. It is true the point  was  not  expressly
       addressed in the grounds seeking permission  to  appeal  or  in  the
       grant of permission to appeal. However, the issue is so bound up  in
       the judge's article 8 assessment and the issue  of  very  compelling
       circumstances that I find it is appropriate to regard it as  a  live
       issue in this appeal.


   33. The principle was summarised by Lord Reed in  Agyarko  as  where  an
       applicant, even if he  were  residing  in  the  UK  unlawfully,  was
       certain to be granted leave to enter if  an  application  were  made
       from outside the UK, then there might be no public interest  in  his
       removal (see paragraph 51). The point  has  sometimes  been  put  in
       terms that there would be no sensible purpose in  requiring  someone
       to go abroad in such circumstances (see Hayat v SSHD [2012] EWCA Civ
       1054).

   34. In R (on the application of Chen) v SSHD (Appendix FM - Chikwamba  -
       temporary separation - proportionality) IJR [2015] UKUT 00189  (IAC)
       it was held that Appendix FM does not include consideration  of  the
       question  whether  it  would  be  disproportionate  to   expect   an
       individual to return to her home country to make an entry  clearance
       application to re-join family members in the UK. There may be  cases
       in which there are no insurmountable obstacles to family life  being
       enjoyed outside the UK but where temporary separation to  enable  an
       individual to  make  an  application  for  entry  clearance  may  be
       disproportionate. In all cases, it will be  for  the  individual  to
       place before the Secretary of State  evidence  that  such  temporary
       separation will interfere disproportionately with protected rights.


   35. Mr O'Brien told me that counsel for the appellant and the presenting
       officer at the hearing in the First-tier Tribunal had a conversation
       in which there was agreement that the appellant would be  likely  to
       succeed on application for entry clearance.  However,  there  is  no
       indication from the decision that it was presented to the  judge  in
       such a way that he was entitled to rely  on  a  concession  to  that
       effect. That would be highly unlikely given the fact, as Ms  Everett
       said, it was not clear, let alone certain, that the appellant  would
       succeed.

   36. It must be right, particularly given the passage of time,  that  the
       entry clearance officer be enabled to take a fresh look at the  case
       by reference  to  the  rules,  including  the  general  grounds  for
       refusal.  It  must  also  be  right  to  consider   the   individual
       circumstances of the case when assessing  the  impact  of  temporary
       separation.  This  is  a  couple  in  the  early  years   of   their
       relationship (now marriage) with no children. The facts are far from
       those in Chikwamba. As Elias LJ put it in Hayat,
         "14. In this case it was held that the  removal  of  the  applicant
         with her child to the harsh and unpalatable conditions of  Zimbabwe
         would cause  a  grave  disruption  to  the  family  which  was  not
         justified simply by invoking  the  mantra  that  rules  are  to  be
         obeyed. There has to be good reason for enforcing  the  policy  and
         there was none in this case. Lord Brown held  that  in  the  longer
         term no one doubted that  the  family  would  be  allowed  to  live
         together and accordingly, on the particular facts he concluded that
         her removal would violate her Article 8 rights."
   37. I conclude the judge did not give adequate reasons for his  decision
       to allow the  appeal  on  the  basis  the  decision  to  remove  the
       appellant was disproportionate.


   38. For these reasons I set aside the decision first-tier Tribunal.

Remaking the decision
   39. I remake  the  appeal  by  dismissing  it.  The  salient  facts  are
       undisputed and are amply set out above.


   40. I accept the appellant and  Ms  Moorghen  enjoy  family  life  as  a
       married couple. They married very recently but their family life was
       well established by June 2017 when the First-tier Tribunal heard the
       appeal. It is reasonable to infer from the  appellant's  silence  at
       his earlier appeal in April 2013 that the relationship had  not  yet
       taken on any degree of seriousness of permanence. I accept there has
       been cohabitation since October 2014, a  period  of  a  little  over
       three years. I accept the couple entered into a  religious  marriage
       in September 2016. I accept that Ms Moorghen's family are supportive
       and fond of the appellant. There  are  no  children.  There  are  no
       significant health issues. The appellant is no longer claiming he is
       at risk in Pakistan and he could return there and stay  with  family
       members while he applies for entry clearance.

   41. In conducting the balancing exercise to assess  the  proportionality
       of the decision, I accept the appellant has no criminal  record  and
       no reasons have been given that  his  presence  in  the  UK  is  not
       conducive to the public good. However, his  immigration  history  is
       very poor and shows a grave disregard for the law. He  has  achieved
       his lengthy residence by dint of  pursuing  a  false  asylum  claim.
       There is strong public interest in maintaining immigration  controls
       in this case. The usual consequence of overstaying is removal.

   42. The appellant's relationship with Ms Moorghen has  been  established
       and developed in the knowledge that the appellant had  no  right  to
       remain in the UK and he could be required to leave.

   43. The appellant has not shown there are  insurmountable  obstacles  to
       his family life continuing in Pakistan. It is not the preference  of
       the parties for very understandable reasons. However, the test is  a
       demanding one and the matters raised regarding Ms Moorghen's lack of
       language skills and the need for her to contribute to  her  parents'
       mortgage repayments do not show anything more than that there  would
       be some degree of hardship in expecting the couple to live  together
       in Pakistan.  The  obstacles  mentioned  could  be  overcome  by  Ms
       Moorghen learning the language  and  by  her  parents  making  other
       financial arrangements.

   44. The application of sections 117B(2) and (3) does not  weigh  against
       the appellant. However, the application  of  section  117B(4)  means
       little weight can be given to his relationship with Ms Moorghen.

   45. There are no very compelling circumstances which outweigh the public
       interest in  removal  in  this  case.  The  appellant's  immigration
       history is very poor and  his  relationship  with  Ms  Moorghen  has
       always been precarious. It is possible to find cases in which family
       life is so strong that removal will be disproportionate  even  where
       there are no insurmountable  obstacles  to  family  life  continuing
       elsewhere. However, that is not the case in this appeal.


   46. In particular, there are good reasons for expecting the appellant to
       return to Pakistan to apply for entry clearance  so  that  an  entry
       clearance  officer  can  apply  proper  scrutiny  to  the  claim  by
       reference to Appendix FM of the rules.  Time  has  elapsed  and  the
       impact of the appellant's immigration  history  and  persistence  in
       bringing a false asylum claim are proper matters for the  respondent
       to assess. Unlike in a case such as Chikwamba,  there  would  be  no
       significant hardship in the temporary interruption  to  family  life
       which this would bring about.
