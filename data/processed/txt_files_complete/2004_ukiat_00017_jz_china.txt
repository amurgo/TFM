                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.    The appellant is the Secretary of State for the Home Department.   The
      respondent is a citizen of the People's Republic of China.

2.    The appellant appeals against the decision of an Adjudicator, Mr  M  J
      S Axtell, who in a determination promulgated on 29 July 2003,  allowed
      the respondent's appeal on asylum grounds and on human rights  grounds
      under both Article 3 and  Article  8,  against  the  decision  of  the
      appellant taken on 16 November 2002, to direct her removal.

3.    The Secretary of State was not represented before the Adjudicator.  We
      believe that this is regrettable.  Had the  Secretary  of  State  been
      represented, we doubt very much whether that this  appeal  would  have
      appeared before us.

4.     Today,  before  us,  Mr  J  Cobham  a  representative  from  Andrews,
      Solicitors, appeared on behalf of the respondent and  Mr  J  Gulvin  a
      Senior Home Office Presenting  Officer,  appeared  on  behalf  of  the
      appellant.

5.    The grounds assert that the Adjudicator erred in law in  finding  that
      the respondent was a member of a particular social group  or,  as  the
      Adjudicator describes her, as a  member  of  a  "social  group".   The
      Adjudicator gives no definition of this particular  social  group  and
      the Tribunal held in its decision in Jin Huan Lin  (01/TH/00099)  that
      fear of Chinese officials in relation  to  the  one-child  policy  was
      based neither on actual, nor perceived political opinion, nor  was  it
      part of a particular social group.

6.    The Adjudicator made a finding that  if  the  respondent  were  to  be
      imprisoned following a Court appearance, imprisonment would expose her
      to a breach of Article 8 and the grounds challenge  that  finding,  on
      the  basis  that  there  was  no  evidence  that  imprisonment  was  a
      punishment carried out by the Chinese  authorities  in  respect  of  a
      violation of the one child policy.  Reference was made to the  Country
      Information and Policy Unit assessment.  The grounds asserted that the
      respondent  would  not  be  at  risk  of  any  imprisonment  and   the
      Adjudicator's findings, in allowing  the  appeal  on  the  basis  that
      Article 3 would be breached, was an error.   The grounds also referred
      to the Tribunal's decision in Chun Lin  Chi  (01/TH/2056),  where  the
      Tribunal made findings that violation of  one-child  policy  does  not
      result in imprisonment.

7.    The Vice President, in granting leave, also  found  that  in  allowing
      Article 8 the Adjudicator may have erred.  Mr  Gulvin  submitted  that
      there was no particular social group identified  by  the  Adjudicator,
      although in paragraph 14, he found that the respondent was a member of
      a "social group".   He also relied on the Tribunal's determination  in
      Chi, which found that a breach  of  the  one-child  policy  would  not
      result in imprisonment.  As a result, there could not be  said  to  be
      any risk of Article 3 being breached.  He referred us to paragraph 15,
      where the Adjudicator dealt with the  respondent's  Article  8  claim.
      The Adjudicator identified that  the  respondent  had  a  private  and
      family life with her little girl.  He concluded that the prospects for
      the respondent and her little girl in  China  were  poor  and  it  was
      impossible to say what would happen to  that  child.    There  was  no
      evidence before the Adjudicator to allay the apprehension he had  that
      that daughter would be taken away from her  if  she  went  to  prison.
      Paragraph 15 was, submitted Mr Gulvin, wrong.  The Adjudicator has not
      considered the question of proportionality and  in  any  event,  there
      could not possibly be said to be a breach of Article  8  family  life,
      since, if the respondent were to be removed from the  United  Kingdom,
      the daughter will be too.   The breach of private life  found  by  the
      Adjudicator is, submitted Mr. Gulvin,  based on pure speculation.   It
      is based on the speculation that  that  respondent  will  be  sent  to
      prison and the further speculation that if she is, her  daughter  will
      be taken away from her.  These errors mean that this determination  is
      fatally flawed, he submitted.

8.    Responding on  behalf  of  the  respondent,  Mr  Cobham  asked  us  to
      consider "the result and effect  of  enforcement  of  the  appellant's
      decision which would result  in  both  an  Article  8  and  Article  3
      breach".   If the respondent were to be returned to China  she  would,
      he submitted, be tried and jailed.   We invited him to take us to  the
      objective evidence that supported his contention that  the  respondent
      would be imprisoned for having  breached  the  one-child  policy.   He
      referred us to paragraph 5.91 of the Country  Information  and  Policy
      Unit report.  That clearly identifies that prison conditions in  China
      are harsh and frequently  degrading.   We  invited  him  to  draw  our
      attention to the objective evidence  that  showed  that  there  was  a
      likelihood that this respondent would be sent to prison.  He  referred
      us to page  21  of  the  bundle  of  documents  that  was  before  the
      Adjudicator.  Page 21 is the fifth page of what appears to be a 9 page
      document, although there are only six pages in the bundle. It appeared
      to have been extracted from  the  internet.    There  was  nothing  to
      indicate who was the author of the document.  He referred  us  to  the
      section entitled "Women" and asked us to note that when women's rights
      or interests conflict with the party or government policy  the  latter
      takes precedent.   This means for example, that abuses relating to the
      family planning policy are not reported  in  the  media  or  discussed
      publicly.  We asked if he could identify any objective  evidence  that
      clearly demonstrated that a  breach  of  the  one-child  policy  would
      result in this respondent being sent to prison.    He  was  not  in  a
      position to do so.

9.    We have concluded that we must allow the Secretary of State's appeal.

10.   The document at pages 17 to 23 of the respondent's  bundle  appear  to
      have been published in March 1995. There was nothing in the  documents
      to show who had published it and, as we have indicated, we  were  only
      supplied with an extract of the  document.   On  page  22,  under  the
      heading  "Violations  resulting  from  family  planning  policy",  the
      document said "the Chinese constitution mandates the duty  of  couples
      to practice family planning.  Since 1979 the  central  government  has
      attempted to implement a family planning policy  in  China  and  Tibet
      that the government states is "intended to control population quantity
      and improve its quality".  Central to this  initiative  is  the  "one-
      child per couple" policy.  Central authorities have verbally condemned
      the use of  physical  force  in  implementing  the  one-child  policy.
      However its implementation is left to local laws and regulations."  We
      can find nothing in this document of to indicate that a breach of  the
      one-child policy is likely  to  result  in  imprisonment.    The  CIPU
      report itself  details  the  one-child  policy  in  Section  6(b),  at
      paragraph  6(b)116  onwards.   At  6(b)   121,   the   reports   says:
      "Disciplinary measures against those who violate the  policy  includes
      fines,  within  holding  of  social  services,  demotion   and   other
      administrative  punishments  that  sometimes  results   in   loss   of
      employment.    Levels of fines vary by region; in  Shanghai  the  find
      for violating birth quotas is three times the combined salary  of  the
      parents, while in Zhejiang province it is 20% of  the  parents  salary
      paid  over  5  years.   Unpaid  fines  have  sometimes   resulted   in
      confiscation or destruction of homes and personal  property  by  local
      authorities".

11.   In short, there is no objective  evidence  that  could  have  led  the
      Adjudicator to believe that, on return to the Republic of China,  this
      respondent will face imprisonment.  We find that he was wrong to allow
      the respondent's asylum claim.  He has  failed  to  identify  how  the
      claim engaged the Convention.   He appears to have allowed the  asylum
      claim on the basis that this respondent will face imprisonment on  her
      return to China, but there is simply no objective evidence  before  us
      to support this contention.   He also allowed the respondent's Article
      3 claim on the basis that she will be  imprisoned.   We  find  he  was
      wrong to do so.  The Adjudicator's consideration of  the  claim  under
      Article 8 is also flawed, since it appears to be based on a breach  of
      private life on return to China, in that the respondent and her  child
      will, he suggests, be separated.    That is, as Mr  Gulvin  suggested,
      speculation upon further speculation.  There is no evidence that  they
      will be separated.   They undoubtedly have established a private  life
      in the United Kingdom, but there is no evidence  before  us,  nor  was
      there before the Adjudicator, of any significant elements  of  private
      life enjoyed by them and we are  persuaded  that  any  breach  of  the
      respondent's Article 8 private life  rights  would  be  proportionate,
      given that the legitimate aim of immigration control is a very weighty
      consideration, which is not easily overridden.

    12. For all these reasons, we allow the Secretary of State's appeal.


Secretary of State's appeal allowed.
