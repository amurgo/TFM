Representation:

For the appellant:     Not represented
For the respondent:    Mr J Parkinson, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appellant's against the  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Colyer promulgated 28.1.15, dismissing  her  appeal  against  the
    decision of the Entry Clearance  Officer,  dated  29.10.13,  to  refuse
    entry clearance to the United Kingdom as an adult dependant relative of
    a person settled in the UK.  The Judge heard the appeal on 21.8.14  and
    23.12.14.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge Lewis refused permission to appeal on 8.4.15.
    However, when the application was renewed to the Upper Tribunal,  Upper
    Tribunal Judge Grubb granted permission to appeal on 23.6.15.

 3. Thus the matter came before me on 15.3.16 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 4. For the reasons set out below I find no error of law in the  making  of
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal such as to require the decision
    of Judge Colyer to be set aside.

 5. The appellant was not represented at the error of law  appeal  hearing.
    By letter dated 14.3.16 the appellant's representatives explained  that
    they were not in funds to represent the appellant orally at the appeal,
    but sought to rely on grounds submitted to the First-tier Tribunal  and
    additional grounds for the Upper Tribunal hearing.

 6. I confirm that I have  carefully  considered  the  submissions  in  the
    grounds, together with those advanced by Mr Parkinson, before  reaching
    my decision.

 7.  This  is  not  the  first  application  by  the   appellant.   Earlier
    applications were refused in 2009, 2010, and 2011, under paragraph  317
    of the Immigration Rules.

 8. The application which is the subject  of  this  appeal  was  considered
    under section EC-DR of Appendix FM, which provides the requirements for
    entry clearance as an adult dependent relative.

 9. At the date of refusal the appellant was 23 years of age.  Her  parents
    reside in the UK and she lives independently in India. She claimed that
    as a young female it was not acceptable for her to live alone. Although
    she has a brother in India, she claims to have no contact with him. The
    application was for settlement to live with her father. She claimed  to
    be financially dependent  on  her  father,  but  the  only  independent
    evidence of that was a single Western Union receipt confirming transfer
    of �150 in July 2013.

10. The application was refused because the Entry Clearance Officer was not
    satisfied  that  the  appellant  required,  due  to  age,  illness,  or
    disability long-term personal care to perform everyday  tasks,  as  set
    out in EC-DR.

11. Between the application and the hearing of the appeal in the First-tier
    Tribunal, the appellant's father passed away.  She  sought  instead  to
    rely on dependency of her mother and brother, who by then were  in  the
    UK. However, her mother's appeal against refusal of leave to remain  as
    a spouse was dismissed.

12. Judge Colyer relied on a previous appeal decision  in  2011,  in  which
    this appellant, her mother, and two siblings were  the  appellants.  In
    that earlier decision the previous judge found that they had  not  seen
    the sponsor since he left India in September 2007. That judge dismissed
    the appeals on both immigration and human rights grounds. Judge  Colyer
    dealt with a further  appeal  by  the  appellant's  mother,  which  was
    dismissed in 2014 and although she became appeal rights exhausted,  she
    did not leave the UK and had not yet been removed.

13. Judge Colyer was  informed  that  the  appellant's  father,  a  British
    citizen, passed away in February 2014. As this is  an  out  of  country
    appeal, it is important to note that this was after the decision of the
    Entry Clearance Officer in October 2013. The First-tier Tribunal should
    have restricted consideration of the appellant's circumstances to those
    prevailing at the date of the refusal decision.

14. Judge Colyer found that the appellant did not meet the requirements  of
    Appendix FM for entry clearance. The judge then went on to consider her
    circumstances outside the Rules under article 8 ECHR. The  judge  noted
    that the appellant and the sponsor had  not  lived  together  for  many
    years and that as he had passed away  any  family  life  with  him  had
    ended.

15. Judge Colyer found that on the facts of the case the  decision  of  the
    Entry Clearance Officer did not amount to an interference  with  family
    life. However, the judge  also  considered,  in  the  alternative,  the
    proportionality of the decision, pursuant to the  stepped  approach  in
    Razgar. The judge found that the appellant had live  all  her  life  in
    India and had never resided in the UK. She was mature enough, the judge
    considered, to continue her independent life in India. The judge  found
    the decision of the Entry Clearance Officer was not disproportionate.

16. The grounds of application for permission to appeal challenge only  the
    article 8 decision.

17. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Grubb noted that the First-tier
    Tribunal Judge had taken into account  the  death  of  the  appellant's
    father and the change  in  the  mother's  immigration  status,  and  an
    appeal, all matters taking place after  the  date  of  decision.  Judge
    Grubb considered there to be an arguable error of law given that s85(5)
    and s85A(2) limits consideration to "the circumstances appertaining  at
    the time of the decision." However, Judge Grubb added, "The materiality
    of any error will, of course, have to  be  established.  Certainly  the
    Judge goes on to determine proportionality even if he were  wrong  that
    Art 8.1 is not engaged. However, it is not clear whether he  made  that
    assessment  on  the  basis  of  the  current  circumstances  or   those
    appertaining at the date of  decision.  At  this  stage,  I  cannot  be
    satisfied it is not material and so  I  grant  permission  on  the  s85
    ground. That error, if established, may well infect the proportionality
    assessment."

18. The judge having found that the appellant did not meet the requirements
    of the Immigration Rules, I am not satisfied that there was any need or
    justification for the judge  to  go  on  to  consider  the  appellant's
    circumstances outside the Rules under article 8 ECHR at all.

19. In SS (Congo) and Others [2015] EWCA Civ 387 the Court of  Appeal  held
    that even though a test of exceptionality does not apply in every  case
    falling within the scope of Appendix FM, it is accurate to say that the
    general position outside the sorts  of  special  contexts  referred  to
    above is that compelling circumstances would need to be  identified  to
    support a claim for grant of leave outside the new  Rules  in  Appendix
    FM.

20. On the facts  of  this  case  no  such  compelling  circumstances  were
    identified. The appellant's father left India in 1997 and thus even  at
    the date of decision, the appellant had not lived  with  him  for  some
    years. It would appear she lived  with  her  mother  and  other  family
    members in India, until her mother also came to the UK. It is not clear
    to me whether at the time of the decision the  appellant's  mother  was
    still in India, but it is certainly the case that even if  she  had  by
    then come to the UK, she had no right to remain here, as the subsequent
    appeal decision held.

21. Even if the judge was justified in going on to consider the appellant's
    circumstances outside the Rules, pursuant to  article  8  ECHR,  it  is
    clear that on any basis the article 8 claim was doomed to failure.

22. First, the judge was not satisfied  that  there  was  any  family  life
    between the appellant and her father for there to be  any  interference
    by the refusal to grant entry clearance, and that  there  was  no  such
    interference in any event. In the previous appeal decision,  relied  on
    by Judge Colyer, the  Tribunal  also  found  that  there  had  been  no
    interference with family life with the father except by his decision to
    come to the UK and by the mother's subsequent decision to come  to  the
    UK with the appellant's siblings.

23. As the Rule 24 response, dated 20.8.15, points out, at  �57  the  judge
    would not have found  in  the  appellant's  favour  regardless  of  the
    subsequent death of her father, thus the error in failing to assess the
    circumstances prevailing at the date of the  refusal  decision  is  not
    material. At �57 the judge  went  on  to  rely  on  additional  matters
    including the death of the father, but it is clear from the first  half
    of the paragraph that the judge concluded the refusal  decision  caused
    no significant interference with the relationship between the appellant
    and her father.

24. In essence, the appellant seeks to take advantage of the failure of the
    judge to consider the circumstances at the date of decision and  before
    the death of her father removed the entire basis of the application, as
    pointed out in the Rule 24 response. As Mr Parkinson explained  in  his
    submissions, even if the  judge  had  allowed  the  appeal,  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer would have refused entry clearance because  of  those
    change of circumstances. It is submitted that in that case whether  the
    judge considered the circumstances prevailing at the date  of  decision
    or the date of hearing, the outcome of the appeal was academic.

25. There is no merit in this ground of appeal, as the judge went on in any
    event to conduct  a  proportionality  assessment  on  the  basis  of  a
    potential relationship between the appellant and her family members  in
    the UK. In effect, given the history, this was potentially  a  stronger
    family life claim that she had in relation to her claim of family  life
    with her father. However, even on that stronger basis it is clear  from
    �62  onwards  that  the  judge  considered   the   decision   was   not
    disproportionate. Even if the judge had restricted consideration to the
    circumstances at the date of refusal decision in 2013, when the  father
    was still alive, there was no basis for a finding that the decision was
    disproportionate, especially when the fact that the appellant could not
    meet the requirements of the Immigration  Rules  which  cater  for  the
    admission of adult dependent relatives.

26. In all the circumstances, the dismissal of the appeal  was  inevitable,
    given the failure of the appellant to  meet  the  requirements  of  the
    Rules and the rather tenuous  family  life  link  claimed  between  the
    appellant and her father who left  India  in  1997.  The  admission  or
    consideration of post-decision evidence could have made  no  difference
    to the outcome. It follows that no material error of law  is  disclosed
    in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

Conclusions:

27. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: the appeal has been dismissed.
