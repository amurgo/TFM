                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    This matter  comes  before  me  pursuant  to  permission  having  been
    granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Pitt dated 5 December 2014. The  appeal
    relates to a decision by First-tier Tribunal Judge Grimmett sitting  at
    Sheldon  Court,  Birmingham  whereby  a  Decision   and   Reasons   was
    promulgated on 14 July 2014.   The Judge at the First-tier Tribunal had
    allowed the appeal against the Entry Clearance  Officer's  decision  to
    refuse entry clearance to join a British spouse.

2.    The Entry Clearance Officer appealed against the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge's decision. For ease of reference I shall continue  to  refer  to
    the parties as they were before the First-tier  Tribunal  despite  this
    being an appeal by the Entry Clearance Officer. Two particular  matters
    are relied upon in the grounds  of  appeal  namely  that  there  was  a
    material misdirection in law because:

   1) The Judge failed to have regard to the requirements of Appendix FM-SE.
      Further the Judge failed to follow the need to consider matters as  at
      the date of application. The calculations in  respect  of  maintenance
      showed that the requirements were not met;
    (2)    The findings in respect  of  Article  8  were  infected  by  the
         incorrect findings relating to the Rules.


3.    At the hearing before me Mr Richards said that essentially the  appeal
    dealt with a narrow point. The Judge had heard evidence. The  issue  of
    funds was put in issue. She made a finding that at the  date  of  entry
    clearance the requirements were met. That ignored  the  fact  that  for
    Appendix FM the evidential requirements had to be met at  the  time  of
    the application. The Judge had not turned her mind to that  and  it  is
    right to say that in terms of materiality she did go on  to  allow  the
    appeal under Article 8 but it is clear from reading  her  determination
    the maintenance finding was a factor which weighed  in  favour  of  the
    Appellant in terms of the proportionality assessment and its  analysis.
    Mr Richards submitted that there were material errors of law  and  that
    therefore the decision ought to be set aside.

4.    Mr Ali said in his submissions that there was  no  error  of  law.  He
    said we agree with Judge Dineen who had initially refused permission to
    appeal. The Judge was entitled to come to her decision. In Ali and Bibi
    at the Supreme Court there was  a  similar  approach  and  I  would  be
    familiar with that. There needs to be a certain amount  of  flexibility
    with Article 8 and come to some conclusions.

5.    In response to my question as to whether the  �18,600  requirement  in
    respect of maintenance was met at the time  of  application  for  entry
    clearance, at the time of decision or at the time of  hearing,  Mr  Ali
    said that the �17,147.75 figure needed to be carefully considered. That
    was because, even by the time of the  review  by  the  Entry  Clearance
    Manager, you can take into account 6 months of income. There were other
    documents before the Judge. Mr Ali said we accept that the Judge  could
    have written it better. He said that in respect of  paragraph  10  what
    the Judge was trying to say was that overtime could be considered. That
    referred to two months of income and not 6 months.

6.    In so far as Article 8 was concerned, the  Judge  went  onto  consider
    Article 8 and there were compelling reasons. The Judge  had  said  that
    even if she was wrong about maintenance there were  compelling  reasons
    for the appeal to be allowed under Article 8.  He said  the  compelling
    reasons were (1) the Sponsor had lived in the UK for some 25 years, (2)
    His  family  were  here,  (3)  His  employment  and  (4)   His   family
    circumstances.

7.    Mr Ali said that the Rules were not intended to catch  people  out.  A
    lot of people were  caught  out  in  respect  of  income.  For  example
    countries like Yemen. For that reason the Supreme Court has  asked  for
    further submissions in the English language case. It will  be  8  or  9
    month before the Supreme Court gives its decision in MM.

8.    In reply Mr  Richards  said  that  to  underline  his  submissions  in
    respect  of  maintenance  the  Judge  had  fundamentally  misread   the
    employer's letter. It said that overtime was readily available. It  did
    not say that the Sponsor has availed himself  of  it.  In  relation  to
    Article 8 it was  quite  clear  from  paragraph  14  that  it  was  not
    necessary and not proportionate. She had said that  the  Appellant  had
    met the Rules, but that was wrong and therefore it infects the  Article
    8 assessment too.  In response to my question  Mr  Richards  said  that
    paragraph 15 in terms of proportionality only really  referred  to  the
    cost of a reapplication and that was not the point of  proportionality.
    In reality the submissions being made were akin  to  near  miss  and  I
    would know that the Court has frowned up such a course again and again.



9.    I permitted Mr Ali to have the last word, despite  it  not  being  his
    appeal and he said that the Judge had applied Gulshan as she  had  said
    that there were compelling reasons.

10.   I had reserved my decision.

11.   I allow the Entry Clearance Officer's appeal. I do so because of  four
    reasons.

12.   Firstly, Appendix FM-SE to the Immigration Rules requires  that  there
    be a minimum income requirement of �18,600 gross income per  annum.  At
    the time of the application the Sponsor's income was  �17,147.75  gross
    per annum. That was not sufficient to meet the Rules.  This  figure  of
    �17,147.75 came from the Sponsor,  from  his  P60.  The  shortfall  was
    �1452.75.

13.   Secondly the Judge had erred in concluding that  the  availability  of
    overtime meant that the income was �18,600  or  more.  As  Mr  Richards
    highlights the employer's letter states, "He is in a full time position
    and on an annual salary with the option of increasing his working  hour
    per month in the form of overtime which is readily available".

14.   Thirdly, I am unable to accept Mr Ali's  submissions  that  the  Judge
    did not word things well but that "she meant to say"  that  the  income
    for the latest 6 months meant that the �18,600 requirement was met.  In
    fact she did not say that. Not even in  oblique  terms.   She  made  it
    clear at paragraph 10 of her  decision  that  she  had  considered  the
    payslips for March 2013 and April 2013 and that showed a  gross  income
    of �3,285.45. When that was calculated it showed an  annual  income  of
    some �19,472, but I cannot accept that the Judge's calculation for  two
    months somehow can be transposed to income for 6 months. Indeed  as  Mr
    Ali agreed this point now being raised by him was not raised in a  Rule
    24 Reply or otherwise. Even it had been, it seems clear  to  me  to  be
    wrong in any event because it cannot be that two months of  income  can
    become 6 months income. There is no reason to suppose that the payslips
    for, say December 2012 (�1381.25) and January 2013  (�1381.25)  can  be
    upgraded to what was earned in March 2013 and  April  2013.   In  April
    2013 the income was �1648.25. In March 2013  it  was  �1636.91  and  in
    February 2013 it was �1487.50. For the previous  three  months  it  was
    �1381.25 per month and therefore identical amounts. Even  on  Mr  Ali's
    submissions, this does not get near �18,600 if extrapolated through  to
    12 months. It comes to �17,833.40 for 12 months. Still  well  short  of
    �18,600.  The calculations for 6 months are not any more  help  to  the
    Appellant either. The  simple  fact  is  that  there  were  not  enough
    earnings in that year, whether considering the whole year or  just  the
    last 6 months.

15.   Fourthly, the Judge materially erred when she  said  at  paragraph  14
    that at the time of the decision "the Appellant and her husband met all
    the requirements of the Immigration Rules". This is a material error of
    law because at the time of the application (or even at the time of  the
    decision or the date of the review by the Entry  Clearance  Manger-both
    dates contended for by Mr Ali) the maintenance  requirements  were  not
    met. It is clear that Article 8 does not provide the  Tribunal  with  a
    general dispensing power. Mr Ali's  reference  to  the  Sponsor  having
    lived in the UK for 25 years and that he has a job, his home and family
    here are not compelling reasons in a legal sense although of  course  I
    accept they are on a human level. Those are factors which will apply to
    most settlement cases. Paragraph 15 of the Judge's decision cannot save
    the material error made in paragraph 14.

15.   I make it clear,  as  I  indicted  during  the  hearing,  I  am  quite
    sympathetic to this couple's situation. The real focus of  the  initial
    refusal of entry clearance was whether or not there was a  genuine  and
    subsisting marriage. The Judge was very impressed with the Sponsor as a
    witness. She found in clear terms that the  marriage  was  genuine  and
    subsisting. I can see though how the Judge  was  side  tracked  by  the
    oblique reference to maintenance in the Respondent's  decision.  Having
    succeeded on the genuine marriage aspect, I can  well  understand  that
    then having to deal with maintenance was somewhat of a surprise for the
    Appellant. However, as the Entry  Clearance  Officer's  decision  makes
    clear, "regardless of the minimum income requirement"  the  application
    had been refused on that fundamental basis. That did not mean  that  no
    other part of Appendix FM-SE needed to be satisfied. The decision  made
    clear that maintenance was always an issue that the  Appellant  had  to
    satisfy. There was never  any  concession  in  respect  of  it  by  the
    Respondent. The fact that the Judge was impressed with the Sponsor as a
    witness did not overcome the requirement to meet  all  aspects  of  the
    applicable Immigration Rule.

16.   Nor do I consider that there is any  aspect  of  the  Supreme  Court's
    decision in Ali and Bibi v Secretary of State for the  Home  Department
    which can assist the Appellant in relation to the Immigration Rules  or
    in respect of Article 8. I am also aware that  the  Supreme  Court  has
    heard appeals in respect of the minimum income requirement but  I  have
    to apply the law as  it  stands.  It  is  entirely  a  matter  for  the
    Appellant, but armed with the Judge's very favourable findings  and  if
    his income situation really is as Mr Ali  suggests,  then  the  perhaps
    speedier course suggested in the Entry Clearance Officer's  grounds  of
    appeal that there be a new application for entry clearance will perhaps
    be discussed  after  my  decision.  Of  course  I  am  not  making  any
    suggestions of what applications, if any, the Appellant should make.

Notice of Decision

The First-tier Tribunal's decision contains a material error of law  and  is
therefore set aside.

I remake the decision and dismiss  the  Mrs  Tauseef's  appeal  against  the
Entry Clearance Officer's decision to refuse entry clearance.

No anonymity order is made.
