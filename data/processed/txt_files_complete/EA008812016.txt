Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr A Jafar, Counsel on Direct Access
For the Respondent:    Ms A Everett, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This decision is the remaking of the appeal of  Mr  Ahmad  against  the
    Secretary of State's decision dated 8  January  2016  which  refused  a
    residence card showing his status as someone in a durable  relationship
    of an EEA national exercising treaty rights.

 2. Mr Ahmad is a citizen of Pakistan and was born on  5  April  1976.   He
    bases his claim that  he  is  entitled  to  a  residence  card  on  his
    relationship with Ms Paulina Kamykowska, a Polish national.

 3. Mr Ahmad's appeal was initially refused by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Plumptre in a decision dated 6 September 2017 which did not address the
    merits of the case but found that  there  was  no  First-tier  Tribunal
    jurisdiction.  In a decision dated  27  February  2018  Upper  Tribunal
    Judge Reeds found an error of law following the Court of Appeal case of
    Khan v SSHD [2017] EWCA Civ  1755.   The  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal was set aside to be remade in the Upper Tribunal.

 4. I heard evidence from Mr Ahmad, Ms Kamykowska, her mother,  Mrs  Teresa
    Kamykowska  and  from  Mr  Abdul  Saeed,  a  former  colleague  of   Ms
    Kamykowska.  Ms Kamykowska began giving her evidence in English but  it
    became apparent that she required a Polish interpreter and the  hearing
    was adjourned until one could attend.  Her mother  also  gave  evidence
    through a Polish interpreter.  In addition  to  the  oral  evidence,  I
    heard submissions from Mr Jafar and Ms Everett.

 5. The background to this matter is that Mr Ahmad  came  to  the  UK  from
    Pakistan on 2 September 2007 with leave as a student and retained  that
    leave until 28 February 2009.   He  applied  on  27  October  2008  for
    further leave to remain but this was refused.  He appealed against that
    refusal but on 14 October 2010 his appeal rights  were  exhausted.   He
    remained in the UK thereafter, being an overstayer.

 6. Mr Ahmad maintains that he met Ms Kamykowska in July 2013.  The  couple
    maintain that they have been in a relationship from approximately  that
    time and therefore Mr Ahmad qualifies for a residence card  recognising
    his status as being in a durable  relationship  with  an  EEA  national
    following Regulation 8(5) of the EEA  Regulations.   This  was  why  Mr
    Ahmad applied on 24 July 2015 for  a  residence  card  recognising  the
    relationship.

 7. The respondent refused the application  for  a  residence  card  for  a
    number of reasons. The respondent  did  not  find  that  the  documents
    provided in support of the application were sufficient to show that the
    couple were in a durable relationship.  The documents provided were  in
    the  form  of  copies  rather  than  originals.   Certain   documentary
    requirements for tenancies and deposits  were  not  provided  with  the
    tenancy agreements.  Little weight was placed on them as a result.

 8. Further, on 9 December 2015 an enforcement officer visited the  address
    that had been provided by Mr Ahmad, [ - ] Uxbridge Road.  A person  who
    lived there, Ms Zawada, was interviewed.  She informed the  enforcement
    officer, on being shown a photo of Mr Ahmad, that he had moved  out  of
    the address in February 2015.  She maintained that he had lived at  the
    address in one room on his own for six months.  On the  basis  of  that
    evidence, the  respondent  concluded  that  the  couple  had  not  been
    cohabiting at the address as claimed and that this cast  doubt  on  the
    genuineness of the relationship.

 9. Further, the respondent noted that the  day  after  the  visit,  on  10
    December 2015 the appellant notified the  respondent  of  a  change  of
    address.  It was found that this  coincidence  further  undermined  the
    reliability of the evidence that had been provided in  support  of  the
    application.

10. The correct approach to a case  where  there  is  an  allegation  of  a
    marriage of convenience is set out  in  the  case  of  Papajorgji  (EEA
    spouse - marriage of convenience) Greece [2012] UKUT  00038  IAC.   The
    ratio of Papajorgji is that there is no initial burden on an  applicant
    to adduce evidence showing that a marriage is not one of convenience if
    the respondent brings nothing  indicating  to  the  contrary.   If  the
    respondent does allege a marriage of convenience,  then  "there  is  an
    evidential burden  on  the  claimant  to  address  evidence  justifying
    reasonable  suspicion  that  the  marriage  is  entered  into  for  the
    predominant purpose of securing residence rights".  There is  therefore
    a  requirement  for  the  respondent  to  have   evidence   "justifying
    reasonable suspicion".  Where that is so as at [39] of Papajorgji:

         "In summary, our understanding is that, where the issue  is  raised
         in an appeal, the question for the judge will therefore be 'in  the
         light of the totality of the information before me,  including  the
         assessment of the claimant's answers and any information  provided,
         am I satisfied that it is more probable than not this is a marriage
         of convenience?'."

11. In my judgment it  is  unarguable  that  the  respondent  had  evidence
    "justifying reasonable suspicion"  here,  where  the  written  evidence
    before the Secretary of State as  of  the  date  of  the  decision  was
    relatively limited and where the  enforcement  visit  had  led  to  the
    statements set out above from Ms Zawada about the couple not living  at
    that address and the  appellant  having  lived  there  alone.   I  must
    therefore consider "the totality of  the  information  before  me"  and
    decide whether on the  balance  of  probabilities  whether  this  is  a
    marriage of convenience.

12. There were a number of aspects of the  evidence  supporting  the  claim
    that the appellant and Ms Kamykowska were in  a  genuine  relationship.
    Not least of this was the personal appearance of Ms Kamykowska's mother
    at the hearing. The fact that she was prepared to travel from Poland to
    give evidence suggested to me that she believed that  the  relationship
    between her daughter and the appellant was  genuine.  Mrs  Kamykowska's
    evidence about the relationship history of the  couple  was  consistent
    with that provided by them and, in my view, reflected what  she,  as  a
    prospective mother-in-law living  in  a  different  country,  could  be
    expected to know about the relationship. Her evidence attracted  weight
    to the appellant's case, therefore.

13. There were also bank statements and other  documents  such  as  driving
    licences, NHS letters and college letters addressed  to  the  appellant
    and Ms Kamykowska at [ - ] Princess Road, [ - ] Uxbridge Road and [ - ]
    Brabazon Road at the times they claim to have been living  together  at
    those addresses. That evidence must be weighed  in  their  favour  when
    considering whether, on the balance of probabilities,  they  are  in  a
    genuine relationship.  This was not  determinative  evidence,  however,
    and to an extent limited  by  there  being  no  correspondence  at  all
    addressed to the couple jointly.

14. The couple also provided photographs of  them  on  different  occasions
    showing them together and appearing to be a happy  couple.  There  were
    also printouts of text and computer message exchanges suggestive  of  a
    relationship.

15. I also noted Ms Kamykowska's distress at the end of her  evidence  when
    talking of how difficult it would be for her  were  the  appellant  not
    allowed to remain and of her genuine love  for  him.   Ms  Kamykowska's
    distress, as far as I could judge, was genuine and I placed some weight
    on this, taking a cautious approach however  given  the  well-rehearsed
    dicta on placing weight on demeanour.

16. Mr Saeed's evidence was also supportive of the couple's claim to be  in
    a genuine relationship.  Nothing about his evidence suggests that he is
    particularly close to either the appellant or Mr Ahmad, however, and it
    was my view that I could place some but not a great deal of  weight  on
    Mr Saeed's evidence as a result.

17. There were also aspects of the evidence that had to be weighed  against
    the claim that the relationship was genuine.

18. Mr Ahmad stated clearly in his oral evidence that he was  supported  by
    Ms Kamykowska as he did not work.  He stated that when he needed  money
    from her he would ask.  He stated that "we use the same bank  account".
    He was asked specifically if he had any other income and stated "no".

19. Mr Ahmad also stated in response to the question "are  you  religious?"
    as follows:

         "Not much.  I'm Muslim.  I used to  pray,  now  for  many  years  I
         haven't prayed that much.  I don't observe on a daily basis.   It's
         a long time since I've been to the mosque, more than a year."

20. When asked about the appellant's income, Ms Kamykowska stated  that  he
    had money sent to him by his mother and his siblings.  She thought that
    it was approximately �300 to �500 a month.  Sometimes it was per  month
    and sometimes it was per week or sometimes per fortnight.   It  was  to
    help him pay for the house.  When he  had  money  from  his  family  he
    helped paying the rent.  Generally, however, she paid the rent  as  she
    worked.  Ms Kamykowska also referred to having a "common bank  account"
    and "a shopping card".  Both she and Mr Ahmad  referred  to  using  the
    same bank account.

21. Ms Kamykowska was asked about Mr Ahmad's religious practice.   She  was
    asked whether he was a practising Muslim and stated "I think so".  When
    asked how often he went to the mosque she stated "sometimes he goes  on
    Fridays".  She was asked roughly how often he went to  the  mosque  and
    stated "let's say twice a month".  She referred to him praying at home.
     She was asked when he last went to the mosque and stated:

         "Maybe a month ago.  He worshipped this morning at home.  I brought
         him that mat as a present."

22. In re-examination Ms Kamykowska was asked again  about  when  Mr  Ahmad
    last went to the mosque.  She confirmed that  it  was  approximately  a
    month ago.  She also stated that he prays approximately three  times  a
    week at home, sometimes more.  She confirmed that he went to the mosque
    approximately twice a month.  The frequency of the attendance  had  not
    changed.  If anything, she thought that he prayed more now  because  he
    was concerned about having to return to Pakistan.   Asked  again  about
    whether his observance by way of going to the mosque  had  changed  she
    stated that he sometimes went five times a month, sometimes three times
    a month or would pray at home.  She then stated "mainly he used  to  go
    on a Friday".  She was then asked when he had  stopped  going  five  or
    three times a month she replied "he mostly prays at home".  She  stated
    that the change from practising three or five times a month of going to
    the mosque had changed approximately two months ago.

23. The evidence of the appellant and  Ms  Kamykowska  on  the  appellant's
    finances and religious practice, two matters upon which they  could  be
    expected to be very highly consistent if they were living together in a
    genuine relationship, was starkly inconsistent. The two very  different
    accounts of the appellant living off Ms Kamykowska with no other income
    and being  in  receipt  of  notable  funds  from  his  family  are  not
    reconcilable. Both the appellant and Ms Kamykowska  referred  to  using
    the same bank account but nothing in the documents showed that they had
    a joint account or access to the same account.  On  the  contrary,  the
    bank statements provided showed that Mr Ahmad has his own bank  account
    through which reasonably significant sums of money  come  and  go.   On
    page 190 of the bundle, for example, the bank statement shows a balance
    of over �3,000 for a great deal of the month with a sum of  �410  being
    paid out as a room deposit, a cash withdrawal being  taken  out  on  15
    April 2015 and �850 cash paid into the account.

24. The other stark discrepancy in  the  evidence  is  that  concerning  Mr
    Ahmad's religious observance.   The evidence of the  appellant  and  Ms
    Kamykowska on this is again extremely different and again on  a  matter
    upon which there is no reason why the parties should not be consistent.
    The  highly  inconsistent  evidence  on  these  two  matters  indicated
    strongly that the relationship was not genuine.

25.  Further,  I  accepted  that  Mrs  Kamykowska,  the  appellant  and  Ms
    Kamykowska   gave   generally   consistent   evidence   about   serious
    disagreements between Ms Kamykowska and Ms Zawada which they maintained
    explained her untruthful comments made to the  enforcement  officer  in
    December 2015  I accept that it is possible,  albeit  unusual,  that  a
    friend such as Ms Zawada, after an intense argument, could  have  acted
    in the malign manner  described  and  give  false  information  to  the
    immigration  authorities,   regardless   of   the   extremely   serious
    implications this would have.

26. None of the evidence here addressed the fact of the appellant's  change
    of address to [ - ] Brabazon Road arriving with the respondent the day
    after the enforcement visit, however.  The materials before me did  not
    contain a  tenancy  agreement  or  other  documents  showing  when  the
    appellant and Ms Kamykowska moved to Brabazon Road. Their evidence  was
    that after moving out prior to the enforcement visit, they had not  had
    any contact with Ms Zawada so the change of address could not have been
    provided in response to that visit. I found the change of address being
    notified to the respondent the day  after  the  visit  and  absence  of
    documents showing  when  the  move  to  Brabazon  Road  undermined  the
    explanation  for  the  information  provided  by  Ms  Zawada   to   the
    enforcement officer.

27. There was also shifting evidence concerning Ms Kamykowska's arrival  in
    the UK  in  2013  and  the  involvement  of  Ms  Zawada  which  further
    undermined the claim that the couple were in  a  genuine  relationship.
    The witness statements were set out in very similar terms,  maintaining
    only  that  the  couple  met  on  Facebook.   The  appellant  asked  Ms
    Kamykowska to come to the UK and sent her a  ticket.   She  came  on  6
    August 2013, he met her at the airport and took her to a house where he
    had arranged for her to have a room.  After a month she moved  in  with
    him at [ - ] Princess Road.  They became engaged on  Valentine's  Day
    2014.  In August 2014 the couple moved to [ - ] Uxbridge Road, a "new"
    address.  Ms Kamykowska's mother visited them there for approximately a
    week in October 2014.  The appellant asked  his  fianc�e's  mother  for
    permission to marry and she consented during that visit.

28. The appellant, Ms Kamykowska and her mother all stated at the  hearing,
    however, that Ms Kamykowska and Ms Zawada were old friends from Poland,
    having studied at college together. They also all confirmed  that  when
    Ms Kamykowska came to the UK in July 2013 she moved into a room at [ -
     ] Uxbridge Road which is where Ms Zawada was also living.

29. The appellant stated that Ms Kamykowska came to the UK to meet him.  In
    her evidence Ms Kamykowska stated that she came to the UK for work  and
    to see Ms Zawada and Mr Ahmad.  She was asked  whether  Ms  Zawada  was
    expecting her to come to stay in the UK and she stated:

         "Yes, I came because I knew her.  She promised me work.   That  she
         would help me in England but she didn't."

30. Ms Kamykowska was asked whether she met Mr  Ahmad  through  Ms  Zawada.
    She replied "I think so, but he sent me a ticket in  order  to  let  me
    come to the UK".  She was then asked  whether  Ms  Zawada  put  her  in
    contact with Mr Ahmad.  Ms Kamykowska again stated "I think  so".   She
    was asked whether she had arranged to stay with Ms Zawada before coming
    to the UK and replied "yes".  She then stated that Mr  Ahmad  had  made
    the arrangements for her to live with Ms  Zawada.   Ms  Kamykowska  was
    also asked whether Mr Ahmad had known Ms Zawada before she had come  to
    the UK.  She stated that Ms Zawada and her boyfriend and Mr Ahmad  were
    friends.

31. If that was so, it is not clear to me why this involvement  of  an  old
    friend who introduced Ms Kamykowska to  Mr  Ahmad  and  with  whom  she
    shared a house on arrival in the UK would not have  been  mentioned  in
    the witness statements. The original version of how the couple came  to
    know each other and meet in the witness statements makes  no  reference
    to Ms Zawada, to the appellant and Ms Kamykowska both  already  knowing
    her, to her introducing them, to Ms Kamykowska living with her when she
    first came to the  UK.  I  found  it  notable  that  in  their  witness
    statements neither the appellant nor Ms Kamykowska referred to  [ - ]
    Uxbridge Road as her place of former residence but state that when they
    went to live there in 2014 as a "new place". That was not  correct.  Ms
    Kamykowska had lived there before, had done so because  her  friend  Ms
    Zawada was living there and she and the appellant knew that to be so.

32. It is not just that  there  is  inconsistent  evidence  about  how  the
    appellant and Ms Kamykowska came to know each other and why she came to
    the UK that weighs against the appellant here. It  is  that  the  first
    account omits any  mention  of  Ms  Zawada,  the  person  who  provided
    significant information to the respondent undermining  the  claim  that
    the appellant and Ms Kamykowska were in genuine relationship. This  add
    to the lack of clarify already surrounding the couple moving out of [ -
    ] Uxbridge Road but the respondent not being made aware of  this  until
    after the enforcement visit and, coincidently, on the  very  day  after
    that visit.

33. There other matters that undermined the claim that the couple were in a
    genuine relationship. The witness statements of the  appellant  and  Ms
    Kamykowska are clear as to the couple becoming engaged  on  Valentine's
    Day 2014.  This is a significant date for a significant event.   It  is
    one that the couple could be expected to remember.   Neither  could  do
    so, in their oral evidence,  being  somewhat  vague  as  to  when  they
    decided to get married.

34. Further, the witness statements also maintained that Mr Ahmad asked  Ms
    Kamykowska's mother for permission to marry when she visited the couple
    in the autumn of 2014. When asked at the  hearing  when  he  asked  the
    mother's  permission  to  marry,  Mr  Ahmad  stated  that  it  was   in
    approximately 2016 when they had booked a marriage ceremony  which  was
    later cancelled. He then stated that he had spoken  to  Mrs  Kamykowska
    earlier about the marriage but again linked this to booking the wedding
    ceremony. When asked again about any earlier discussion of  the  couple
    marrying, he referred to it being "at the end of  2014  -  by  2015  we
    definitely did". Again, given his very limited direct contact with  Mrs
    Kamykowska and claim in the witness statements to  have  asked  her  in
    person during her only visit, I found this inconsistency undermined the
    weight I could place on Mr Ahmad's evidence.

35. In summary, as above,  there  are  positive  aspects  of  the  evidence
    supporting the claim of Mr Ahmad to be in a genuine  relationship  with
    Ms Kamykowska. However, the very significant  discrepancies  concerning
    the appellant's finances and religious practice, shifting  evidence  as
    to how the couple came to know each other and Ms  Zawada's  involvement
    in Ms Kamykowska coming to the UK, unclear evidence as to the change of
    address at the exact time of adverse  information  being  given  to  an
    enforcement officer and lack of  consistency  as  to  when  the  couple
    decided to marry  and when permission was sought from  Ms  Kamykowska's
    mother lead me  to  find,  on  balance,  notwithstanding  the  positive
    aspects of the evidence,  that the relationship between Mr Ahmad and Ms
    Kamykowska was not genuine.  I must therefore find that Regulation 8(5)
    is not met.

36. The appeal is dismissed under the EEA Regulations.

Upper Tribunal Judge Pitt
