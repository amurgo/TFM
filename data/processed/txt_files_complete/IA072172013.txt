For the Appellant:     Mr S Kandola, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr I Palmer, Counsel instructed by Visa Legal


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   This is an appeal by the Appellant (hereinafter  called  the  Secretary
    of State) against the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal,  who  in  a
    determination promulgated on 10 April 2014 allowed the  appeal  of  the
    Respondent (hereinafter called the claimant) a citizen of Nigeria  born
    on 10 March 1979 on Article 8 ECHR grounds.

2.   It would be  as  well  to  mention  that  also  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal was the appeal of the claimant's son born on  19  August  2009
    against the decision of the Secretary of State dated 20  February  2013
    refusing his application for leave to remain as the child of a  Tier  1
    Migrant.  His appeal under the EEA 2006 Regulations was  allowed  under
    Regulation 7 and  on  human  rights  grounds.   That  decision  is  not
    challenged by the Secretary of State.

3.   The claimant appealed the decision of the Secretary of State  dated  21
    February 2013 refusing her application for leave to remain as a Tier  1
    (General) Migrant under paragraph 245CA(c) and (f) and  Appendix  A  of
    the Immigration Rules as well as under Article 8.

4.   The brief immigration history of the claimant  is  that  on  4  October
    2007 she was given leave to enter the United Kingdom as a student until
    31 January 2009.  On 8 May 2009 she was granted leave to  remain  as  a
    student until 30 April 2010.  On 1 June 2010 she was granted  leave  to
    remain as a Tier 4 (General) Student until 30 September 2011 and  on  4
    November 2010 she was granted leave to remain as a Tier 1  (Post-Study)
    Migrant until 4 November 2012.

5.    The  Secretary  of  State  noted  that  in   the   claimant's   latter
    application, she had implied that she also wished to rely on her family
    and/or private life established  in  the  United  Kingdom  pursuant  to
    Article 8.

6.   As recorded by the Judge at paragraph 5 of his determination:

         "On 9 July 2012 the Immigration Rules were amended and now  include
         provisions for applicants wishing to remain in the  United  Kingdom
         on the basis of their family or  private  life.   These  Rules  are
         located at Appendix FM and paragraph 276ADE respectively."

7.   The Judge noted  that  the  claimant  contended  that  her  removal  to
    Nigeria would breach her Article 8 rights to a private and family  life
    and that of her son.  Further,  the  fact  that  the  claimant's  son's
    relationship with his father, who was married to  an  EU  national  and
    therefore had roots in the UK, meant that consideration had to be given
    to the breach of her son's right to family  life  with  his  father  in
    addition to his family life with the claimant.

8.   In that latter regard, it was noted that the  claimant's  son's  father
    was married to  a  Dutch  national  and  indeed  at  the  time  of  his
    relationship with the claimant.

9.   The Sponsor stated in a statement dated 14 March 2014 that his son  was
    conceived during an extra-marital affair with the claimant and although
    he was still married, divorce proceedings had been  initiated  but  not
    finalised.

10.  The Judge considered that this did  not  affect  the  position  of  the
    claimant's son under the 2006 Regulations  (see  paragraph  12  of  the
    determination) and that the claimant's son was a direct  descendant  of
    the spouse of an EEA national and so a family member of an EEA national
    within Regulation 7.

11.  The claimant was regarded as her son's primary carer  and  it  was  the
    view of the Judge at paragraph 14 of his determination that:

         "On the basis that (the claimant's son) cannot be removed from  the
         United Kingdom, (the claimant) cannot be removed  from  the  United
         Kingdom without separating her from (him).  In these circumstances,
         her removal cannot be characterised as proportionate under  Article
         8  of  the  1950  Convention  particularly  having  regard  to  the
         obligations under Section 55 of the 2002 Act and the  dicta  in  ZH
         (Tanzania) v SSHD [2011] UKSC 4."

12.  The Judge having made reference to the provisions of  Section  55;  the
    observations of Lady  Hale  at  paragraph  33  of  ZH  (Tanzania)  and;
    paragraph 2.7 of  the  Guidance  "Every  Child  Matters  -  Change  for
    Children: Statutory Guidance to the  UKBA  on  Making  Arrangements  to
    Safeguard and Promote the Welfare of Children", continued as follows:

         "18. (The claimant's) immigration history is without  blemish  (her
             application as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant failed  because  she
             was not aware of the removal of the Tier 1 (General) category.
              She conceived (her son) when she had permission  to  stay  in
             the United Kingdom and indeed went on to obtain three  further
             extensions of her leave."

13.  The Judge continued by referring to aspects of the guidance  in  Sanade
    and Others (British Children - Zambrano - Dereci)  [2012]  UKUT  000487
    (IAC) and continued:

         "19. In any event the (Secretary of State) has  accepted  (and  the
             Tribunal has endorsed) the proposition that 'where  the  child
             or indeed the  remaining  spouse  is  a  British  citizen  and
             therefore a citizen of the European Union, it is not  possible
             to require them to relocate outside of the European  Union  or
             to submit that it would be reasonable for them to do so'."

14.  The Judge continued that even if he was wrong in that regard, the  case
    for the claimant under Article 8 was compelling.  The  claimant  had  a
    flawless immigration history and was entirely  self-sufficient  in  the
    United Kingdom.  She was a youth leader at her church and in the church
    choir.  The Judge continued:

         "After obtaining an MA in  International  Business  from  Greenwich
         University in July 2010, she has been successful in employment  and
         then in business.  She worked as a Health Care Assistant  with  the
         Reed Nursing Agency and  in  2011  she  started  her  own  business
         Christellvic Idea Limited, which initially operated as an  internet
         caf�, hair  salon  and  money  transfer  facility.   Latterly,  the
         business has moved to estate agency  trading  as  'Impression  Idea
         Services'.  Her gross and net profit from October 2011 to September
         2012 was �52,003 and �26,016 respectively (letter dated 29  October
         2012 from Fradalit Associates at page  C1  (Secretary  of  State's)
         bundle refers).  For part of her time in  the  United  Kingdom  she
         also continued working on a consultancy basis for LA Zones Oil  and
         Gas who are based in Nigeria, although she no longer does so."

15.   The  grounds  in  support  of  the  Secretary  of  State's  successful
    application to appeal that decision were based on the  contention  that
    the First-tier Judge erred in law in failing to consider the claimant's
    claim under Appendix FM and paragraph 276ADE  of  the  Rules.   It  was
    pointed out that:

         "The Judge turned immediately to  consider  the  first  Appellant's
         Article 8 claim outside the Rules (paragraph 14).  This approach is
         wrong in law.  The Judge should have instead, first determined  the
         Appellant's Article 8 claim  under  the  Rules  with  reference  to
         Appendix FM and paragraph 276ADE of the Rules.


         Further, only if there is an arguable  case  that  there  are  good
         grounds for granting leave to  remain  outside  the  Rules,  is  it
         necessary for Article 8 purposes to go on to consider whether there
         are compelling circumstances not sufficiently recognised under  the
         new Rules to require the grant of such leave (Gulshan (Article 8  -
         new Rules - correct approach) Pakistan [2013] UKUT 00640 (IAC))."

16.  In granting permission to  appeal,  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Renton,  in
    noting that the Judge had found the Secretary of State's decision to be
    disproportionate mainly on the basis that the claimant's removal  would
    not be in the best interests  of  her  son,  agreed  that  the  Judge's
    failure to consider  whether  the  claimant  met  the  requirements  of
    Appendix FM and paragraph 276ADE did amount to  an  arguable  error  of
    law.

17.  Thus the appeal came before me on 16 July 2014 when my first  task  was
    to  determine  whether  the  determination  of  the  First-tier   Judge
    disclosed an error or errors on  a  point  of  law  such  as  may  have
    materially affected the outcome of the appeal.

18.  Mr Kandola helpfully pointed out that the Secretary of  State  did  not
    challenge the Judge's factual findings.  He  had  carefully  considered
    the Judge's reasoning but had no instructions to withdraw the Secretary
    of State's challenge to his findings and his position was therefore  to
    continue to rely on the grounds.  Mr Kandola  pointed  out  that  there
    were parts of the Judge's determination that were not satisfactory  but
    he accepted that such concerns "might not be material to the outcome".

19.  Mr Kandola had in mind the Judge's reference to the Guidance in  Sanade
    that on the particular facts of this case was not arguably  applicable.



20.   Nonetheless  Mr  Kandola  continued  that  he  acknowledged  that   at
    paragraph 21 of the Judge's determination, he was clear that even if he
    was wrong in that regard  the  claimant's  case  under  Article  8  was
    "compelling".  And in that light given that the Judge had  specifically
    stated that the claimant failed to meet the requirements of the  Rules,
    it could not be said that on the judge's findings that it was not  open
    to him to conclude that there were no  compelling  grounds.   In  those
    circumstances whilst Mr Kandola accepted he might struggle to make  his
    case in such circumstances, his formal position remained that he relied
    on the Secretary of State's grounds.

21.  In the light of Mr Kandola's helpful clarification, I did  not  trouble
    Mr Palmer to address me.

Assessment

22.  It is apparent upon my reading of the determination,  that  the  First-
    tier Judge erred in law in applying Article 8 in a free-standing manner
    and not by reference to the materially more constrained test laid  down
    in case law, which requires  compelling  circumstances  or  exceptional
    circumstances within a proportionality test, where the  facts  relating
    to the individual application are assessed in their own light and  then
    weighed against the important public interest objectives which underpin
    the immigration regime.

23.  In relation to  the  policy  objectives  of  an  individual's  personal
    circumstances to be  weighed  against  the  important  public  interest
    objectives, these are referred to in many cases.  So for example in  ZH
    (above) the Supreme Court held  that  the  interests  of  the  children
    particularly in regard to their nationality were very important  though
    not trump cards over other policy considerations including "the need to
    maintain firm and fair immigration control"  (see  paragraph  33).   In
    other  cases,  for  instance,  involving  the  deportation  of  foreign
    nationals found guilty of criminal acts, there is a public interest  of
    considerable power in deporting criminals in  protecting  society  from
    criminality (see for example SS (Nigeria) v SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ 550).

24.  In the present case it is not the claimant's  case  that  she  met  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules.

25.  The question which therefore arises is whether the particular facts  of
    the claim as found by  the  Judge  gave  rise  to  some  compelling  or
    exceptional circumstances which when measured within a  proportionality
    test gave rise to an Article 8 right which must be recognised.

26.  I note in that regard that the  Judge  heard  oral  evidence  from  the
    claimant and from her son's father  and  that  such  evidence  was  not
    challenged by way of cross-examination.

27.  The Judge proceeded to set out what  he  described  as  the  claimant's
    "flawless immigration history", that was "without  blemish".   Her  son
    was conceived when the claimant had permission to stay in the  UK  "and
    indeed she had gone on  to  obtain  three  further  extensions  of  her
    leave".  The claimant was her son's primary carer and her son could not
    be removed from the United Kingdom, and it followed the claimant  could
    not be removed without separating her from her son.

28.   The  Judge  concluded  that  the  claimant's  removal  could  not   be
    characterised as proportionate under Article 8  having  regard  to  the
    obligations under Section 55 and the guidance of the Supreme  Court  in
    ZH (Tanzania).

29.  Those facts have been found and it is  not  for  me  to  seek  to  make
    findings afresh and indeed Mr Kandola most helpfully clarified that the
    Judge's actual findings  were  not  in  any  event  challenged  by  the
    Secretary of State.

30.  I have come to the conclusion that I should therefore not  disturb  the
    ultimate conclusion arrived at by the First-tier Judge below.  In  this
    respect I would emphasise that this is a finding on specific facts that
    is in my view a marginal decision.  I  have  come  to  this  conclusion
    because when  in  relation  to  the  usual  factors  which  go  into  a
    proportionality balancing exercise, I consider the facts of  this  case
    are towards the extreme end of the spectrum of facts and matters  which
    characterise  these  sorts  of  applications.   They  may  be  properly
    categorised as exceptional or compelling, albeit I do not consider this
    to be other than the marginal conclusion.  For these very reasons I  do
    not view this as a precedent having residence outside of its particular
    facts.

31.  This is not a case where the family life was at  all  times  precarious
    and because as recognised by the Judge in terms of the  best  interests
    of the claimant's child, she was residing legally in the  UK  when  her
    son was conceived.

32.  Her son's position in terms of the basis on  which  the  Judge  allowed
    his appeal under  the  EEA  Regulations  was  important  albeit  not  a
    decisive consideration.

33.  Further the claimant was found to be her son's primary carer.

34.  This is not a case of criminality.  It is not a case  where  to  permit
    the claimant to remain would set a dangerous precedent about precarious
    family life.  This in my view is simply a case on the particular facts,
    where the family rights of the claimant and son as found by  the  Judge
    had unusually been at a level where they might properly be said  to  be
    exceptional or compelling and whilst the Judge was clearly in error for
    the reasons rightly submitted by the Secretary of State in her  grounds
    of appeal, it is apparent to me on  my  consideration  of  the  Judge's
    factual reasoning, that if he had reminded himself as  to  the  correct
    route to follow, it would still have resulted in the harm to the policy
    objectives of maintaining an effective  and  fair  immigration  system,
    having been found to be outweighed.

35.  I find that since the Judge got the right answer albeit  by  the  wrong
    route, it is therefore  not  appropriate  to  allow  the  Secretary  of
    State's appeal as the errors that I have identified  were  I  find  not
    material, and it leaves the claimant in the position she ought to be on
    the findings of fact and reasoning that led the Judge to conclude  that
    this was a claim which ought to succeed under Article 8  of  the  ECHR.
    Those findings are unassailable.  The fact that the Judge has erred  in
    law did not amount to a material error of law and for those  reasons  I
    have decided not to set aside the First-tier  Judge's  decision  and  I
    dismiss the Secretary of State's appeal.

Conclusion

36.  The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law material to its outcome and  I
    therefore order that it shall stand.
