Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Karim, instructed by MA Consultants
For the Respondent:    Mr Nate, Home Office Presenting Officer

If an application for entry clearance is refused on the ground of forged
documents in a previous application, the Entry Clearance Officer has the
burden of proof. If there was (in relation to the previous application) no
judicial determination of the issue, and no relevant admission, there will
need to be evidence to establish that the documents used in the previous
application were forged.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. The Appellant is a national of India. She appealed to  the  First-Tier
      Tribunal, or the Asylum and  Immigration  Tribunal  as  it  then  was,
      against the decision of the Respondent Entry Clearance  Officer  on  4
      June 2009 refusing her application for entry clearance as  the  spouse
      of the sponsor. The Immigration Judge dismissed her  appeal,  but  she
      succeeded in her application for permission to  appeal  to  the  Upper
      Tribunal.

   2. The Appellant's application for entry clearance was not her  first.  A
      previous application had been refused on 5 December 2008.  The  ground
      for refusal in that case was  that  false  bank  statements  had  been
      submitted in support of the application. There was no  appeal  against
      that decision but instead  a  new  application  was  made,  which  was
      refused as we have indicated.

   3. The Entry Clearance Officer in refusing the application indicated that
      he was satisfied  that  the  parties  were  formally  married  to  one
      another. He reached no clear conclusion on the other  requirements  of
      paragraph 281 of the Statement of Changes  in  Immigration  Rules,  HC
      395, but concluded his notice of refusal with the following words:

         "At section 2.6 of your application form you  have  clearly  stated
         that the passport provided  for  this  application  is  your  first
         passport. However I am aware that you were recently  refused  entry
         clearance with a different passport. You have offered  no  credible
         explanation as to why you have not declared your previous passport.
         I am therefore satisfied that you have made a false declaration  on
         your application form.

         I further note that your previous application for  entry  clearance
         was refused, as the Entry Clearance Officer was satisfied that bank
         documents provided by you were not genuine. The submission of  such
         documents seriously damages the credibility  of  your  application.
         Given that  you  have  today  made  a  false  declaration  on  your
         application form and that  you  have  previously  submitted  forged
         documents I am satisfied that you have previously  contrived  in  a
         significant way to frustrate  the  intentions  of  the  Immigration
         Rules. Any future application will automatically be refused  for  a
         period of 10 years since your last application, unless a concession
         applies.

         I therefore refuse your application."

   4. That refusal was perceived by  those  representing  the  Appellant  as
      principally under paragraph 320(11) of  the  Immigration  Rules  which
      permit entry clearance to be refused (the precise phrase  is  "grounds
      on which entry clearance or leave to enter the United  Kingdom  should
      normally be refused") as a matter of  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer's
      discretion:

         "where the applicant has previously contrived in a significant  way
         to frustrate the  intentions  of  these  Rules.  Guidance  will  be
         published giving examples of circumstances in  which  an  applicant
         who has previously overstayed, breached a condition attached to his
         leave, been an Illegal Entrant or used Deception in an  application
         for entry clearance, leave to enter or remain  (whether  successful
         or not) is likely  to  be  considered  as  having  contrived  in  a
         significant way to frustrate the intentions of these Rules."

   5. In presenting the case before the Immigration Judge those representing
      the Appellant recognised that it would not be sufficient to deal  with
      paragraph 320 but that it would also be necessary  to  show  that  the
      Appellant met at the date of the decision the substantive requirements
      of  paragraph  281.  The  Immigration  Judge  accordingly  heard  oral
      evidence from the sponsor and considered written evidence relating  to
      the sponsor's circumstances and income and to his marriage. There  was
      also a witness statement from the Appellant herself.

   6. It is perhaps not surprising, in view of the way in which the case was
      evidently  put  before  the  Immigration  Judge,  that  he  devoted  a
      considerable amount of attention to paragraph  320(11).  He  concluded
      that the  Appellant  had  indeed  submitted  false  documents  on  the
      previous occasion, and  that  the  discretion  implicit  in  paragraph
      320(11) was rightly exercised against her. He went on to consider  the
      substantive requirements of paragraph 281, and concluded that  he  was
      not satisfied that at the relevant date the relationship  between  the
      Appellant  and  the  sponsor  was  correctly  described  a  subsisting
      marriage, or  that  the  Appellant  could  meet  the  maintenance  and
      accommodation requirements of that paragraph. He accordingly dismissed
      the appeal.

   7. The grounds of  appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  raise  two  discrete
      matters. The first is that the Immigration Judge erred in law  in  his
      conclusions on the evidence relating to the  substantive  requirements
      of paragraph 281. As presented  before  us  today  by  Mr  Karim,  the
      arguments are that  the  Immigration  Judge  firstly  failed  to  make
      findings on relevant issues on which he was obliged to make  findings,
      and secondly allowed his opinion on the matters relating to  paragraph
      320 wrongly to infect his views as to the credibility of  the  sponsor
      who gave oral evidence before him.

   8. The second ground is that paragraph 320(11) was wrongly found  by  the
      Immigration Judge to apply to this appeal in any event. We  deal  with
      that point first.

   Paragraph 320(11)

   9. The substance of paragraph 320(11) depends on an applicant's  previous
      history. The reference to a previous application, or to contriving  in
      a  significant  way  to  frustrate  the  intentions  of   the   rules,
      necessarily refers to an event  other  than  one  connected  with  the
      present application. In this appeal the previous event referred to was
      by way of an assertion that forged documents had been presented in the
      earlier application. Mr  Nate,  who  represents  the  Entry  Clearance
      Officer before us, accepts, and in our view entirely properly accepts,
      that the burden of proof that documents are forged rests on the  Entry
      Clearance Officer. If there had been an  appeal  against  the  earlier
      refusal, there is no doubt at all that it  would  have  been  for  the
      Entry Clearance Officer to establish, if he asserted it, that the bank
      statements were forged. But there was no appeal: and, as a result, the
      Entry Clearance Officer was never put to proof  on  that  matter,  and
      there was no judicial decision on it.

  10. That history does not affect the burden of proof in relation  to  this
      appeal. If it is to be asserted in an  appeal  relating  to  a  second
      application that documents in relation to a previous application  were
      forged, the burden of proof remains on the Entry Clearance Officer. Of
      course, if there has  previously  been  a  judicial  decision,  or  an
      admission, of forgery, the burden may be readily  discharged.  But  in
      the present case there was, as has been accepted, no  direct  evidence
      that the  documents  were  forged.  All  that  there  was  before  the
      Immigration Judge was the Entry Clearance Officer's assertion  that  a
      previous application had  been  refused  for  that  reason.  In  these
      circumstances, that is to say where there is no evidence,  the  person
      with the burden of proof loses on that point. It is  thus  clear  that
      the Immigration Judge was not lawfully in  a  position  to  find  that
      there had been forged documents submitted on the previous application.
      His finding that paragraph 320(11) applied to the case was an error in
      law. There was simply no  evidence  upon  which  he  could  make  that
      finding.

  11. We turn then to the substantive issues. The Immigration Judge  records
      some of the oral evidence that he heard in his determination. It is no
      doubt unfortunate that when assessing  the  evidence  as  a  whole  he
      refers to there having been "no evidence" of issues on  which  he  had
      indisputably heard oral evidence. What he clearly meant  was  that  he
      did not believe the oral evidence that he had heard and that there was
      no written evidence supporting it. The vagueness or imprecision of his
      terminology is certainly regrettable. But the  burden  of  Mr  Karim's
      submission is  that  the  Immigration  Judge's  finding  on  paragraph
      320(11) wrongly infected his judgement as to the  credibility  of  the
      sponsor. Mr Karim's submission is that, having found, as he did,  that
      the sponsor and the Appellant together had in the terms  of  paragraph
      320(11) contrived in a significant way to frustrate the intentions  of
      the Rules, he could not come in a proper way to the assessment of  the
      credibility of the oral evidence before him, because his conclusion on
      paragraph 320(11) was itself flawed.

  12. That is a submission that we  do  not  accept.  Although  as  we  have
      indicated it was for the Entry Clearance Officer to establish that the
      documents were forged if he relied on that assertion, it was  for  the
      Immigration Judge to reach a conclusion about the credibility  of  the
      evidence before him. That is a different issue, even if  the  evidence
      related to the same fact. The Immigration Judge heard what the sponsor
      had to say about the previous application, as well as  on  some  other
      matters which we shall come to. Whether or not he was entitled to find
      that the documents were forged (and we have concluded that he was  not
      entitled so to find), he was entitled to  reach  a  conclusion  as  to
      whether the sponsor, who was giving evidence before him was  a  person
      who was being frank and telling the truth. It is quite clear from  his
      determination that, for reasons given in it, he did not conclude  that
      the sponsor was being frank and telling the truth,  and  it  is  that,
      rather than his flawed conclusion on paragraph 320(11)  which  informs
      (rather than infects) his conclusions on the evidence as a  whole.  If
      the case had turned on it, therefore, we should  have  concluded  that
      his  assessment  of  the  evidence   relating   to   the   substantive
      requirements of paragraph 281 shows no material error of law.

  13. It is true, as we have indicated, that his language  is  unfortunately
      imprecise in some areas, but it  is  undoubtedly  the  case  that  the
      sponsor's evidence as to contact with the Appellant herself  was  very
      incomplete in areas where one might have expected  formal  documentary
      support. For example, as we noted during the course  of  the  hearing,
      the Immigration Judge points out that although the sponsor  said  that
      he had been to India some six or seven months before the hearing,  and
      had spent two to two-and-a-half weeks there, he did not at the hearing
      provide his passport in  support  of  that  assertion;  there  was  no
      evidence that any time he had spent in India had been spent  with  the
      Appellant or pursuing married life; and in addition there was,  as  it
      happens, before the Immigration Judge, a letter  dated  six  or  seven
      months before the hearing in which the sponsor said that  he  had  not
      been able to go to India or to take any leave from his job in order to
      do so.

  14. So far as maintenance and accommodation are concerned, what was before
      the Immigration Judge was  a  selection  of  payslips,  an  employer's
      letter, and part of a lease. We say "part  of  a  lease"  because  the
      Immigration Judge had, as we understand it, pages 1, 2,  3  and  7  of
      that document, thus omitting many of the conditions  under  which  the
      lease was granted. The lease was for premises in Hounslow at �925  per
      month,  payable  by  way  of  rent,  apparently  jointly  as  well  as
      individually by the two individuals named as tenant, one  of  whom  is
      the sponsor. Mr Karim indicated that the  Immigration  Judge  was  not
      told anything about any amounts payable by  way  of  council  tax.  Mr
      Karim asserted to us that each of the tenants had to pay only half the
      rent. That appears to be contrary to what the agreement says.  So  far
      as income is concerned, the Immigration Judge's view was that  he  was
      not prepared to believe the sponsor for the reasons that he had  given
      in general, and that he was therefore not prepared to accept that  the
      documentary evidence before him showed that the  sponsor  could  meet,
      for the  purposes  of  himself  and  the  Appellant,  the  maintenance
      requirements of the rules.

  15. The documents as we have looked at them this morning  clearly  do  not
      tell a consistent story. We are concerned with any error of law by the
      Immigration Judge before we attempt to make  any  decision  ourselves.
      Suffice it to say that looking at the evidence as a  whole,  we  would
      find it extraordinarily difficult to identify any good reason  why  it
      should be  said  that  the  Immigration  Judge  was  not  entitled  to
      conclude, as he did,  that  the  evidence  simply  did  not  establish
      substantive compliance with paragraph 281.

   Paragraph 320(7A)

  16. As we have hinted, however, the appeal does not in  the  end  turn  on
      that point. The  Entry  Clearance  Officer  refused  on  two  specific
      grounds. Only one of them was that  there  had  been  deception  in  a
      previous application. The other ground was a false statement  made  in
      the present application. In question 2.6 of the application form,  the
      Appellant, asked the question: "Is this your first passport?" replied:
      "Yes". There is no doubt that that statement was untrue. Indeed, as we
      understand it, although the Entry Clearance Officer noted  that  there
      was no explanation of the untruth of that statement, largely no  doubt
      because he had not sought any explanation,  the  position  before  the
      Immigration Judge was that it was accepted that that statement was not
      a true statement. Various explanations for it were given,  but  it  is
      notable that the  Immigration  Judge,  having  listened  to  the  oral
      evidence before him, did not accept  the  truth  of  the  explanations
      given.

  17. Explanations are, however, not entirely relevant in the circumstances.
      It might be possible to show by way of explanation that what  appeared
      to be a false statement was in fact a true one, but the position  here
      is that the statement was false. Paragraph 320(7A) is in a section  of
      paragraph 320 headed "Grounds on which entry  clearance  or  leave  to
      enter the United Kingdom is to be refused". There  is  no  discretion.
      Paragraph 320(7A) gives the following basis for refusal:

         "Where false representations have been made or false documents have
         been submitted, whether or not material  to  the  application,  and
         whether or not to the applicant's knowledge, or material facts have
         not been disclosed in relation to the application".

  18. This is a case in which  a  false  representation  had  been  made  in
      relation to the application. In the  application  form  the  Appellant
      falsely stated that passport was her first passport. It was  therefore
      a case which fell for mandatory refusal. As we pointed out to Mr Karim
      in the course of argument, if  the  paragraph  relating  to  paragraph
      320(11) of the Immigration Rules had been deleted from the  notice  of
      refusal,  the  last  sentence  refusing  the  application  would  have
      necessarily followed from the  previous  paragraph  dealing  with  the
      false representation.

  19. The Immigration Judge erred in his conclusions relating  to  paragraph
      320(11) but we are not persuaded that he erred in law in finding  that
      the substantive requirements of paragraph 281 were not complied  with.
      In any event, however, he was obliged to dismiss  the  appeal  as  the
      Entry Clearance Officer was obliged to refuse the application, because
      this  was  a  case  where  paragraph  320(7A)  made  refusal  of   the
      application mandatory. Despite having found an error  of  law  by  the
      Immigration Judge, therefore, we dismiss the appeal to this Tribunal.
