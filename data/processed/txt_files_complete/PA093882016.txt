               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


For the Appellant:     Mr S Winter, Advocate, instructed by Latta & Co,
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant sought asylum in the UK on 25 February 2016,  identifying
    himself by the above name and  as  a  national  of  Iran,  born  on  27
    November 1997.

 2. According to the immigration history provided by  the  respondent,  the
    appellant had identified himself on 3 occasions in France by  different
    names and dates of birth and as a citizen of Iraq.

 3. The respondent refused the appellant's claim for reasons  explained  in
    her letter dated 23 August 2016.  She declined to  accept  that  he  is
    Iranian or at risk from the authorities in Iran, and found that  he  is
    Iraqi and could return to Erbil, in the IKR.

 4. First-tier Tribunal Judge Porter dismissed the appellant's  appeal  for
    reasons explained in her decision promulgated on 5 June 2017.  She also
    held that the appellant is not Iranian.  No issue  is  now  taken  over
    that.

 5. At �43, the judge said:

        "...  given  that  I  have  not  accepted  the  appellant's  claimed
        nationality, I have to consider whether  he  would  be  at  risk  on
        return to Iraq ... I have concluded, applying AA Iraq CG [2015] UKUT
        544, that the appellant would be  able  to  overcome  any  temporary
        problems over identification documents if  necessary,  and  that  he
        would be able to relocate  safely  to  the  IKR,  where  that  is  a
        majority Kurdish presence. He  is  able  to  speak  Kurdish  Sorani,
        widely spoken there. I do not accept that he would  be  at  risk  of
        financial destitution there, but considered  he  would  be  able  to
        obtain employment and maintain contact with his family. Accordingly,
        I find ... no risk ... on return to Iraq."

 6. The appellant's grounds of appeal are stated  in  the  application  for
    permission to appeal filed on 19 June 2017 (which in terms  of  the  TP
    (UT) Rules 2008, rule 23 (1A), now stands as the notice  of  appeal  to
    the UT).

 7. The grounds refer to AA headnote 5 and 20 and to the statement  in  the
    refusal decision that the appellant could enter the  IKR  via  Baghdad,
    and contend that the appellant would be unable to travel as he does not
    have and cannot obtain a passport; could not obtain employment,  as  he
    has no CSID; has stated that he has no  family  contact;  it  would  be
    unduly harsh to expect him to settle in the IKR; and the judge did  not
    deal with the submissions made, or give reasons for her decision.

 8. Mr Winter submitted thus:

      i) The grounds raised a short point about the adequacy of the  judge's
         consideration and application of AA.

     ii) The respondent was obliged, on the authority of AA at �170, to show
         that the appellant had been pre-cleared for entry to the IKR.

    iii) Further findings were needed on whether and how the appellant might
         obtain a CSID, find a sponsor, and enter the IKR, and on any family
         assistance he might have.

     iv) It could not reasonably be inferred from such findings as had  been
         made by the FtT that the appellant could relocate to the IKR.

      v) The decision should be set aside and the case  listed  for  further
         hearing of evidence.

 9. Mr Matthews submitted thus:

      i) The pre-clearance point was not in the grounds,  nor  made  to  the
         FtT.

     ii) No application was made to extend the grounds.

    iii) In any event, the point was not sound.  The onus  remained  on  the
         appellant to make his case.

     iv) As the appellant continues  to  maintain  he  is  Iranian,  further
         hearing could serve no purpose, but would be a trip  to  "Alice  in
         Wonderland".

      v) Having failed to make his case, there was nowhere further  for  the
         appellant  to  go,  either  by  way  of  evidence,  or   in   legal
         consequences.

     vi) As matters stood, the appellant was  not  returnable,  and  on  the
         authority of AA, confirmed by the Court of  Appeal,  that  did  not
         confer entitlement to protection.

    vii)  The  appellant's  contention,  "I  am  not  Iraqi",  having   been
         disproved, and nothing else being disclosed, there was  nothing  by
         which he might be found entitled to protection from return to Iraq.

   viii) MY [2004] UIAT was decided in a  different  statutory  and  country
         context, and refers back in  turn  to  Hamza  [2002]  UKIAT  05185.
         However, these cases are a good indication that an appellant cannot
         benefit from protection through a deceitful  claim,  and  that  the
         burden of proof did not reverse onto the respondent.

     ix) Given the appellant's position, and on the findings, there  was  no
         scope for a further fact-finding exercise,  and  there  could  have
         been no other result.

10. Mr Winter in response said that if the judge went  wrong  in  assessing
    the feasibility of return, that remained material, even if it  did  not
    change the ultimate outcome, because findings would be relevant if  and
    when return became feasible; it would not be a futile exercise  if  the
    appeal were  to  be  dismissed  for  different  reasons.   The  present
    decision should not be upheld on the basis of where the burden of proof
    lay, because once the evidence had been led, nothing turned on that.

11. I reserved my decision.

12. It was not put to the FtT that there is a burden on the SSHD  to  prove
    that a Kurd from the IKR has been pre-cleared for return, and it is not
    in the grounds of appeal to the UT. No reason is  shown  to  admit  the
    argument at this late stage.

13. In any event, I do not consider the point to be a good one.

14. AA as summarised in the headnote (before and  after  amendment  by  the
    Court of Appeal) does not state that there is any such burden.

15. In so far as any passages in AA (Iraq) CG [2015] UKUT 00544 may be read
    to suggest that there might be such a burden, that has  not  found  its
    way into the formal guidance, and is contrary to principle.

16. The respondent makes travel arrangements after not before conclusion of
    an appeal.  It would be unworkable to have to put such arrangements  in
    place prior to appeal hearings.

17. It would generally be unlawful for the SSHD to approach the authorities
    of a person with an unresolved asylum claim to arrange removal.

18. Issues about practicality of return in the  event  of  an  unsuccessful
    appeal are for resolution later, not while the appeal  process  remains
    live.

19. The appellant has made no application to lead further evidence,  either
    to show error of law, or if the decision were to be remade.

20. Even if the decision were  to  be  set  aside,  no  scope  for  further
    evidence has been established.

21. I agree that further evidence  from  the  appellant  could  only  be  a
    repetition of his denial that he is from Iraq,  a  fruitless  exercise.
    If he changes his position, that is another case altogether.

22. It is correct that once all evidence has been led, it  often  does  not
    matter where the burden lay;  but  where  there  is  either  a  perfect
    balance, or a vacuum, the outcome does turn on  the  burden  not  being
    discharged.

23. The burden is generally on an appellant to establish the primary  facts
    on which his case relies, to the lower standard.  If he fails to do so,
    his case falls to be dismissed.  No basis has been established  for  an
    exception.

24. Whether on the basis of the findings made by the judge, or  in  absence
    of any findings, the appellant's case was bound to fail.   There  would
    be  no  reason  to  conclude  that  he  would  be  in  difficulty  over
    availability of documentation, or otherwise, in relocating.

25. Country guidance points to relevant matters for consideration; it  does
    not require tribunals to  divine  the  impossible,  or  what  has  been
    deliberately concealed.

26. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.

27. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
