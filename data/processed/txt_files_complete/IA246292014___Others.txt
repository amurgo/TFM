Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Tarlow, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Ell, Counsel


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The respondents to this appeal are citizens  of  Pakistan  born  on  16
    March 1976, 3 March 2009 and 11 July  2005  respectively.  They  are  a
    mother and her children so their appeals have  been  linked  and  heard
    together. The  appellant  is  the  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department, who has appealed with  the  permission  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal against a decision of Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal  M  A
    Khan, allowing  the  respondents'  appeals  against  decisions  of  the
    Secretary of State, dated 2 June 2014, to  refuse  to  issue  residence
    cards as confirmation of  their  rights  of  residence  as  the  family
    members of Mr Ghanzanfar Amin, a Portuguese national born on 19 October
    1963  ("the  sponsor").  Residence  cards  were  refused  because   the
    Secretary of State was not satisfied by the evidence submitted with the
    applications that the sponsor was  exercising  Treaty  rights  and  was
    therefore a 'qualified person' for the purposes of Regulation 6 of  the
    Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006. The judge heard oral evidence  from
    the sponsor and considered the documents submitted.  He  was  satisfied
    the sponsor was exercising Treaty rights and allowed the appeals.

 2. It is more convenient to refer to the parties as they were  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal. I shall therefore refer  to  the  members  of  the
    family from now on as "the appellants" and the Secretary  of  State  as
    "the respondent".

 3. I was not asked and saw no reason to make an anonymity direction.

 4. The respondent sought permission to appeal  on  the  grounds  that  the
    judge failed to make adequate findings as to whether  the  sponsor  was
    exercising his Treaty rights as at the date of decision. Judge  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal Colyer, granting permission to appeal, said it  was
    arguable that there was insufficient documentation before the judge  to
    make a finding on this point.

 5. I heard argument on the question of whether  the  judge's  decision  is
    vitiated by material error of law.

 6. Mr Tarlow simply relied on the grounds seeking permission to appeal. Mr
    Ell argued it was clear from the decision read  as  a  whole  that  the
    judge had in mind the task of deciding whether the sponsor was  working
    as at the date of decision. He argued the judge was entitled to come to
    the conclusion he reached based on the documents before him. In  reply,
    Mr Tarlow maintained the judge's reasoning was inadequate.

 7. Having considered the matter, I find the judge did not make a  material
    error of law such that his decision allowing the appeals should  stand.
    My reasons are as follows.

 8. At first blush there are difficulties with the decision.  In  paragraph
    23 the judge notes the sponsor submitted two documents from  HMRC,  one
    of which (a P60) showed the sponsor earned �5376 in the  2013/2014  tax
    year and another (a letter) stated he earned �13781  in  the  same  tax
    year. The judge notes the sponsor's explanation  that  the  discrepancy
    between the two figures was explained by the fact he had more than  one
    job. However, the judge notes there were also discrepancies on the  pay
    slips provided. The judge concludes his reasoning in paragraph 24:

         "However, one thing is clear from the documentary evidence  in  the
         form of the P60 and the letter from the HMRC that [the sponsor] ...
         has been engaged in employment and has earned the  amounts  claimed
         and which are reflected in the HMRC letter, which shows the  higher
         figure and the P60 [which] shows a lower sum. The issue before  the
         Tribunal is  whether  the  EEA  national  family  member  has  been
         exercising Treaty rights ...  Although there are matters which [the
         sponsor] was unable to explain, there is evidence before me that he
         was engaged in economic activity  as  an  employee  throughout  the
         relevant period."

 9. Three times in that paragraph the judge uses a past tense to  refer  to
    the sponsor's employment and then he refers  to  a  "relevant  period",
    without defining it.   He  also  uses  "was"  in  the  next  paragraph.
    Moreover,  by  linking  his  findings  to  the  HMRC  documents  he  is
    manifestly relying on evidence of a previous period.

10. In my judgment, what saves the decision is the fact the  judge  can  be
    taken to have looked at the evidence filed in the slim bundle  provided
    by the appellants and there are documents in  that  bundle  which  show
    very clearly that the sponsor's employment continued  past  April  2014
    and continued until April 2014, shortly before the  hearing  on  1  May
    2015. The judge referred to the bundle in paragraph 7 of his  decision.
    The sponsor provided his Barclays bank statements and the  last  income
    entry was as recent as 13 April 2015. The reference  on  the  statement
    reads: "Received from "Pride West Limited Ref Mar 15 Salary". There was
    a similar credit on 13 March 2015 for the February 2015 salary  payment
    from West Pride Ltd. There are also regular credits in respect of  Work
    and Child Tax Credits. The net salary from West Pride  Ltd  was  around
    �622. This is not "marginal or ancillary"  employment  and  establishes
    the sponsor was a worker and therefore a 'qualified person' as  at  the
    date of hearing.

11. I find therefore that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal does  not
    contain  a  material  error  of  law  of  the  kind  contended  by  the
    respondent. Accordingly it shall stand and the respondent's  appeal  is
    dismissed.

NOTICE OF DECISION

    The First-tier Tribunal did not make a material error on a point of law
    and its decision allowing  the  appeals  under  the  Immigration  (EEA)
    Regulations shall stand.

    No anonymity direction has been made.
