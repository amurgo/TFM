Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr S.Karim, Counsel, instructed by Zahra and Co,
Solicitors.
For the respondent:    Mr.T.Melvin, Home Office Presenting Officer.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS
Introduction

     1. The appellant, a national Bangladesh, came to the United Kingdom in
        September 2009 as a student. His visa was valid until January 2013
        and was extended until 24 June 2014. He then made an in time
        application for leave to remain as the spouse of a British
        national. That application was refused on 28 January 2015.


     2. His application was considered under appendix FM of the rules and
        refused on suitability grounds. His English language test results
        from 12 December 2014 had been cancelled on the basis they had been
        obtained by deception, that is, by someone else taking the test.
        The respondent went on to consider EX1 and concluded he had not
        demonstrated insurmountable obstacles to the relationship with his
        wife continuing in Bangladesh. She can understand Bengali .They had
        been to Bangladesh on several occasions; his wife was familiar with
        its traditions; her family originated there and they were married
        in an Islamic ceremony. Regarding private life, there was no
        significant obstacle to integration into Bangladesh. No other
        circumstances were identified justifying the grant of leave.

The First tier Tribunal

     3. His appeal was heard at Hatton Cross on 8 June 2017 before Judge of
        the First-tier Tribunal EB Grant. In a decision promulgated on 20
        June 2017 it was dismissed.


     4. The judge did not find the appellant credible and concluded that
        the test had been taken by proxy. Within the respondent's bundle
        there was confirmation from ETS that it had invalidated the test
        result. The judge commented that the appellant had not contacted
        ETS about their invalidation to take issue with this.  Further
        points taken against the appellant were that the test arrangements
        were made by a third party and the appellant's account of events
        changes. The appellant said he had taken the test at Gants Hill but
        the respondent's evidence was that the test was taken at South Quay
        College, a considerable distance away. In this courage had been the
        subject of an in-depth audit resulting in 67% of the tests taken
        between 2012 and 2014  were declared invalid The judge commented
        that ETS had no ulterior motive in cancelling the test result other
        than ensuring the test centres could be relied upon. Reference was
        made by the judge to the case law relating to the evidential and
        legal burdens of proof. The judge rejected the argument that the
        evidence produced could not be relied upon as generic. The judge
        referred to the evidence of invalidation and the disparity over the
        centre where the test was taken.

     5. The appellant had argued that he had no reason to cheat because he
        was competent in English, evidenced by the fact he had obtained a
        degree here through the medium of English. At paragraph 20 the
        judge referred to the fact the appellant was able to give his
        evidence in English was no indicator of his skills in 2012.
        Consequently, the judge found the suitability requirements were not
        met.


     6. The judge then went on to consider the family life the appellant
        had. The judge accepted the relationship with his wife was genuine
        and subsisting. The respondent's decision did interfere with that
        right but the judge pointed out it was lawful and in the interests
        of maintaining effective immigration control. Finally, the judge
        concluded the decision was proportionate. The appellant had been
        here since 2009; had met his wife and 2012 and they married the
        following year. The judge acknowledged that he has in-laws here
        with whom he lives and that he has a private life. However, the
        judge concluded it would not be in the public interest to allow
        someone who had obtained leave by fraud to remain. Whilst his wife
        may have been unaware of his conduct the appellant did.

     7. The judge referred to the appellant's leave being precarious and at
        paragraph 27 said that according to section 117 B little weight
        should be attached to the private and family life developed when
        the leave was precarious.

     8. The judge concluded that family life could continue to be enjoyed
        in Bangladesh and found the account that they had not discussed
        this unconvincing. His wife has extended family there and both of
        her parents were born there. She would be entitled to live in
        Bangladesh through her husband. Alternatively, she could support an
        application for entry clearance. They had no children.

The Upper Tribunal

     9. Permission to appeal was sought on multiple grounds.


    10. The first ground is that the judge did not follow the Devaseelan
        principle in that there had been an earlier appeal which should
        have formed the starting point of deliberations.

    11. The second ground is that the judge in finding the respondent had
        discharge the burden of proof failed to distinguish between the
        legal and evidential burden.

    12. The third ground seeks to fault the judge for relying upon the ETS
        evidence that the test was taken at Gants Hill and not where the
        appellant said.

    13. The fourth ground argues there was a low threshold of explanation
        upon the appellant, described as the `minimum level of
        plausibility'which the judge did not apply.

    14. The fifth ground contended the judge failed to engage with the
        appellant's statement that he was proficient in English and did not
        need to cheat.

    15. The sixth ground was the judge erred in law in stating that under
        section 117 B little weight should be attached to the appellant's
        family life because of his precarious status.The provision refers
        to someone being in the United Kingdom unlawfully rather than
        precariously.

    16. The seventh ground calls upon the Chikwamba argument in relation to
        the suggestion his sponsor could support an application for entry
        clearance.

    17. The eighth ground is that the judge failed to assess the impact of
        the appellant's removal upon his wife and the wider family circle.

    18. Ground nine was that the judge failed to consider the appellant's
        ties and investments in the United Kingdom.

    19. Permission was granted in respect of grounds one, three, six, seven
        and eight.

    20. The respondent has prepared a response dated 12 January 2018
        opposing the appeal. It states the Devaseelan principle does not
        apply as the previous decision was unrelated to the issue arising.
        It contends the other grounds are a disagreement with the outcome
        in relation to the ETS evidence. At paragraph 19 of the decision
        the judge clearly had considered and rejected the appellant's
        explanation as to where he sat test. Regarding article 8 it was
        accepted that in relation to section 117 B the grounds were correct
        but that does not prevent little weight being given to family life
        in the overall proportionality assessment where fraud has been
        used.

    21. At hearing the appellant's representative said the Devaseelan
        point was no longer being pursued. The appeal was otherwise argued
        along the grounds set out in the grounds for permission. It was
        contended the judge had not followed the stages set out in the case
        law with the evidential burden on the respondent; if applicable,
        consideration of the appellant's explanation and then consideration
        of the legal burden. It was argued that the judge did not properly
        consider the appellant's explanation that he took a Bachelors
        degree through the medium of English which had predated the test.
        It was submitted the judge was wrong to simply rely upon the record
        from ETS as to the location of the test.

    22. I was then referred to the article 8 consideration and the error in
        relation to section 117 B and family life. The relationship the
        appellant established with his wife was when he was here lawfully.
        The respondent has acknowledged this in the response. It was also
        argue that if the appellant could meet the rules for entry
        clearance then his removal was disproportionate in line with the
        Chikwamba decision. I was referred to his wife's ties with the
        United Kingdom and the family she has here. The appellant had also
        invested ï¿½10,000 in a business which was not reflected in the
        decision.

    23. In response, the presenting officer relied upon the rule 24
        response. He submitted that the evidence from ETS was clear and
        adequate findings were made by the judge. The appellant had
        presented no evidence in relation to taking the test at an
        alternative centre. He provided no evidence he had paid for the
        test. The judge also commented on the fact he had not gone to ETS
        and taken issue with them over the allegation made. I was referred
        to the case law on the issue of proxy test taking.

    24. It was accepted that the judges reference to section 117 B and
        family life was incorrect but it was submitted this made no
        material difference to the outcome.

    25. In response, the appellant representative again referred to the
        staged approach required in relation to the evidential and legal
        burden. Again, reference was made to the appellant having taken his
        degree shortly before the test.

Consideration

    26. I have considered the decision in its entirety. The appellant's
        difficulties came from the allegation of fraud in the taking of
        English test. It is now known that there was widespread fraud in
        relation to this issue. This went to the heart of the respondent's
        attempts at immigration control in relation to students. As appeals
        have progressed the case law has developed. It was argued before
        the judge that the evidence presented was generic. Originally this
        consisted of the standard statements used in such cases. The judge
        has referred to the fact that the respondent had provided a
        supplementary bundle. Typically there is now a screen-print showing
        a test result being invalidated. At paragraph 16 and 17 the judge
        refers to the relevant case law, particularly MA (ETS-TOEIC testing
        )[2016] UKUT 00450 where the Tribunal reviewed the evidence which
        was similar to that before the judge in the supplementary bundle.
        The judge quotes from the decision at paragraph 51 stating that the
        ETS statement of `invalid 'should be treated as reliable. The judge
        referred to the generic evidence of Mr Millington and Ms Collings
        and the introduction of further specific evidence. Clearly the
        judge was aware of the relevant case law, the evidential and legal
        burden, and the notion of shifting burdens. Paragraph 45 to 47 of
        the judicial review decision in Ranjit Kaur JR 8997-15 provides a
        summary of the standing of the lookup tool.


    27. The judge makes valid points. The first is that ETS have no reason
        to give false evidence against the appellant. Their focus is in
        maintaining the integrity of the testing scheme. The appellant has
        been vague about the test arrangement, referring at one stage to a
        close family friend doing this and then saying the person was not a
        close family friend. There was then the discrepancy as to where the
        test was taken. The grounds criticise the judge for accepting what
        ETS said on this. However, the judge makes the very legitimate
        point that the appellant has not been in contact with ETS or
        otherwise provided an alternative explanation. At para 19 the judge
        concluded that the appellant could not name the correct test centre
        because he never sat the test.

    28.  At paragraph 20 the judge commented on the fact the appellant gave
        his evidence in reasonable English. However, this was no indicator
        as to what his English language ability was back in 2012. It also
        been argued that the appellant had obtained a degree through the
        medium of English. The case law has given various reasons why
        people may use proxy testers. For instant, they may lack confidence
        in their own ability. Whatever the reason, if the test was taken by
        proxy they engaged in deception which was fundamentally at odds
        with the system of immigration control. I find no fault with the
        points made by the judge.

    29. It is correct that the judge was mistaken in referring to section
        117 B and the appellant's family life .The appellant established
        his family life when he was here with leave. It could be argued
        that the leave had been improperly obtained but nevertheless it was
        valid. His situation therefore was that of being someone who is
        here was a precarious status in that it was not confirmed but he
        was not here illegally. Consequently, the statutory provision
        directing that little weight be given related to his private life
        not his family life. I find this to be a slip on the part of the
        judge which was not fundamental. Section 117 B is only part of the
        article 8 assessment. The judge is required to go wider than that
        and they can look at the appellant's conduct in considering the
        proportionality of the decision. The appellant's wife may not have
        appreciated his cheating but the appellant certainly did.

    30. Although his wife is British she has strong connections with
        Bangladesh. She has a choice of going with her husband. The
        alternative, that she assist him in an application for entry
        clearance, is not a Chikwamba situation. The factual matrix in that
        case was quite different. Here, there is no guarantee an
        application will succeed and the appellant would be returning to a
        country where he has not claimed he had any issues.

    31. The respondent's decision correctly reflects the need for
        immigration control in the face of abuse. The judge did not need to
        comment in detail on the appellant's private life. In this context
        the statutory consideration would play a major part.

    32. In summary therefore I find no material error of law established.
        Consequently, the decision dismissing the appeal shall stand.

Decision

No material error in the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge EB Grant has
been established. Consequently, that decision dismissing the appellant's
appeal shall stand
