                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals with permission against the  decision  of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge M A Khan promulgated on 20 February2020, dismissing
    his appeal under the  Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002
    against a decision of the respondent made on 21 March  2019  to  refuse
    his human rights claim which, in turn is based the refusal of leave  to
    enter the United Kingdom as the spouse of a person present and  settled
    here.

 2. The application was refused on the basis that  the  appellant  had  not
    shown: (a) that his  relationship  with  his  spouse  was  genuine  and
    subsisting; and/or, (b)that the  financial  eligibility  criteria  were
    met.

 3. On appeal, the judge  found  that  the  relationship  was  genuine  and
    subsisting but  found  that  the  sponsor  earned  below  the  relevant
    threshold and that in any event, the specified documents  required  had
    not been produced.

 4. The appellant sought permission to appeal on the grounds that the judge
    had erred,  primarily  in  confusing  the  appellant's  wife's  taxable
    earnings with here gross earnings leading him to conclude wrongly  that
    her income was only �8417, and failed, in evaluating  the  evidence  of
    income, to apply the Evidential Flexibility rule to the documents (bank
    statements) omitted from a sequence and which had now been provided.

 5. On 20 May 2020, First-tier Tribunal Judge Osborne granted permission on
    all grounds.

 6. On 30 July 2020 Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Norton-Taylor  gave  directions
    which provided amongst other matters:

          1. I have reviewed the file in this case.  In the  light  of  the
             present need to take precautions against the spread of  Covid-
             19, and the overriding objective expressed  in  the  Procedure
             Rules[1], I have reached the provisional view,  that it  would
             in  this  case  be  appropriate  to  determine  the  following
             questions without a hearing:


               a) whether the making of the First-tier  Tribunal's  decision
                  involved the making of an error of law, and, if so


               b) whether that decision should be set aside.


          2. I therefore make the following DIRECTIONS:


               i) The appellant may submit further submissions in support of
                  the assertion of an error of  law,  and  on  the  question
                  whether the First-tier Tribunal's decision should  be  set
                  aside if error of law is found, to be filed and served  on
                  all other parties no later than 14 days after this  notice
                  is sent out (the date of sending is on the covering letter
                  or covering email);


              ii)  Any  other  party  may  file  and  serve  submissions  in
                  response, no later than 21 days after this notice is  sent
                  out;


             iii) If submissions are made in accordance with paragraph  (ii)
                  above the party who sought permission to appeal  may  file
                  and serve a reply no later than 28 days after this  notice
                  is sent out.


              iv) All submissions that rely on any document  not  previously
                  provided to all other parties in electronic form  must  be
                  accompanied by electronic copies of any such document.


          3. Any party who considers that despite the foregoing  directions
             a hearing is necessary to consider the questions  set  out  in
             paragraph 1 (or either of them) above must submit reasons  for
             that view no later than 21 days after this notice is sent  out
             and they will be taken into  account  by  the  Tribunal.   The
             directions in paragraph 2 above must be complied with in every
             case.


 7. Both parties made submissions in response to directions, the  appellant
    stating that an oral hearing is necessary.

 8. In her reply of 3 September 2020, the respondent  conceded  that  there
    was a material error in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal. It was
    also conceded that the  documentation  provided  established  that  the
    income threshold had been met  (earnings  being  �42017  for  tax  year
    2017/2018) and that  the  missing  specified  documents  had  now  been
    provided at  the  hearing.   The  respondent  then  invited  the  Upper
    Tribunal to find that the requirements of the rules have  been  met  on
    all counts which would be determinative of the appeal under article 8.

 9. The Tribunal has the power to make the decision without a hearing under
    Rule 34 of the Procedure Rules.  Rule 34(2) requires me to have  regard
    to the views of the parties.  Bearing in mind the overriding  objective
    in Rule 2 to enable the Tribunal to deal with cases fairly and  justly,
    and bearing in mind the concession by the respondent,  I  am  satisfied
    that in the particular circumstances of this  case  that  it  would  be
    correct to make a decision being made in the absence of a hearing.

10. I am satisfied that the judge did err in reaching his  decision  as  is
    claimed in the grounds of appeal and as is accepted by the  respondent.
    The decision clearly involved the making of an error of law as  claimed
    as these errors went to the core of whether  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules are met and I set it  aside.  In  the  light  of  the
    respondent's concessions, no purpose is served in  having  any  further
    hearing to remake the decision which I now proceed to do.

11. Given the concession by the respondent, fairly made, that the appellant
    meets all the requirements of the Immigration  Rules,  I  am  satisfied
    that that is so. In these  circumstances,  and  in  the  light  of  the
    concession that this is determinative, I am satisfied that the  refusal
    of entry clearance did breach the appellant's human rights and I  allow
    the appeal on that basis.

12. As the respondent now concedes that the requirements of the  rules  are
    met, it appears appropriate that the appellant should be granted  entry
    clearance on the basis that the Immigration Rules are met, putting  him
    on the 5 year track to settlement.

Notice of Decision & Directions

      1. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did involve the  making  of
         an error of law and I set it aside.

      2. I remake the decision  by  allowing  the  appeal  on  human  rights
         grounds
