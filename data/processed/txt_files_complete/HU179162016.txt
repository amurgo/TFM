For the Appellant:     Mr D Balroop of Counsel instructed by AWS Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms A Fijiwala, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant is a citizen of India born on 26th April  1991,  who  was
    granted leave to remain as the spouse of a British national  from  29th
    January 2014 to 29th July 2016.  On 11th July 2016, he made application
    for leave  to  remain  as  the  spouse  of  a  British  citizen.   That
    application  was  refused.   It  was  refused  because  in  a  previous
    application  he  submitted  an  English   language   certificate   from
    Educational Testing Service which was subsequently cancelled by ETS  as
    a result of the fraudulent use of a proxy test taker.  The Secretary of
    State also believed that there were no exceptional circumstances  which
    would permit her to allow the grant of leave to remain on the basis  of
    a human rights claim outside the Immigration Rules.

2.   The appellant appealed the decision of the Secretary of State  and  the
    appeal came for hearing before Judge Gribble on 3rd August 2017, at the
    First-tier Tribunal in Sheldon  Court,  Birmingham.   She  allowed  the
    appellant's appeal under Article  8.   The  respondent  challenged  the
    decision and leave to appeal was subsequently granted by Upper Tribunal
    Judge Allan.

3.   At the hearing before me today I was told that the Secretary  of  State
    accepts that there is no error of law in  the  determination  of  Judge
    Gribble.  As a result the determination of Judge Gribble  shall  stand.
    The appellant's appeal is allowed.
