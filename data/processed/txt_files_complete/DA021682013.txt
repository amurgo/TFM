                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal, by the , against  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Michael Keane), sitting at Taylor  House  on  15  March
    2016, to  a deportation appeal by a citizen of Jamaica, born 4  January
    1981. The proceedings have had a rather tortuous recent history.

 2. History   This appellant has been here since 2002, and  got  indefinite
    leave to remain in 2008. However, following various lesser convictions,
    including one for driving whilst disqualified, on 29 November  2011  he
    was found guilty of supplying cocaine the  previous  year,  and  on  20
    December sentenced to two years' imprisonment. This  brought  about  an
    automatic deportation order, on 3 October 2013.

 3. Meanwhile the appellant had married a British woman, who still goes  by
    her previous married name; but I shall refer to her as  the  mother  of
    their children, as they are at the centre of this case. First  was  her
    son T, born out of her previous marriage on 13 June 2000, but now  part
    of  their  family;  then  their  son  D  and  their  daughter  A,  born
    respectively on 9 November 2003 and 16 May 2007: sadly,  both  of  them
    suffer from autism.

 4. Law       At the first hearing on 11 February  2015,  counsel  for  the
    appellant (neither Miss Fielden nor Mr Hawkin, who later  appeared  for
    him) conceded, apparently through a misunderstanding of the  law,  that
    he could not satisfy the requirements of paragraphs 399 or 399A of  the
    Immigration Rules. I will set out 399, so far as relevant: it is agreed
    that 399A could not apply in this case. The test  is  very  similar  to
    that in s. 117C (5) of the  Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act
    2002; so it made no difference whether the case  was  considered  under
    the Rules, or article 8 itself.

       '399. This paragraph applies [in the case  of  someone  sentenced  to
       imprisonment of between 12 months and 4 years] if -

    a) the person has a genuine and subsisting parental relationship with  a
       child under the age of 18 years who is in the UK, and

           i) the child is a British Citizen; or

        ii) the child has lived in the UK continuously for at least  the  7
            years  immediately  preceding  the  date  of  the   immigration
            decision; and in either case

            (a) it would be unduly harsh for  the  child  to  live  in  the
            country to which the person is to be deported; and
            (b) it would be unduly harsh for the child to remain in the  UK
            without the person who is to be deported ...'

5. Because of that concession, the judge turned to paragraph 398:

       'Where a person claims that their deportation would  be  contrary  to
       the UK's obligations under Article 8 of the Human Rights  Convention,
       and ...

       (b) the deportation of the person from the UK  is  conducive  to  the
       public good and  in  the  public  interest  because  they  have  been
       convicted of an offence for which  they  have  been  sentenced  to  a
       period of imprisonment of less than 4 years but at least  12  months;
       ...

       the Secretary of State in assessing that claim will consider  whether
       paragraph 399 or 399A  applies  and,  if  it  does  not,  the  public
       interest in deportation will only  be  outweighed  by  other  factors
       where there are very compelling circumstances over  and  above  those
       described in paragraphs 399 and 399A'

 6. This was why the judge, in his first decision, did not  consider  under
    paragraph  399  (a)  whether  the  consequences  of   the   appellant's
    deportation would be unduly harsh for the children,  but  did  consider
    whether  there  were  'very  compelling  circumstances'  of  the   kind
    required. In doing so, he balanced that  requirement,  and  the  public
    interest in the deportation of foreign criminals, and particularly drug
    offenders (see his paragraph 12) against what he said (at 13) were  the
    exceptional circumstances involved in the appellant's family life,  and
    allowed the appeal.


 7. That led the Home Office to bring their first appeal, which was allowed
    by the Upper Tribunal (Judges Doron Blum and  Joanna  McWilliam)  on  9
    December 2015, with a direction for  a  further  hearing  before  Judge
    Keane, at which he was to "...  apply  the  correct  legal  test  under
    paragraph 399 and 399A and, if necessary, under paragraphs [sic] 398 on
    the basis of the material facts that he has already found". The  reason
    for  this  of  course  was  that  paragraph  398  only  came   up   for
    consideration at all if paragraphs 399 and 399A did not apply, and then
    only on the basis of 'very compelling  circumstances'  over  and  above
    those set out in them; so in this case the  requirements  of  paragraph
    399 had to be considered and decided on first.

 8. This is what the judge did at the second  hearing  before  him,  on  15
    March 2016, which led to the decision now  under  consideration,  again
    allowing the  appellant's  appeal.  This  time  the  judge  made  clear
    findings on the 'unduly harsh' test in paragraph 399 (a), at  paragraph
    7, and referred back to those he had made before, at 8. Those  findings
    in themselves are not criticized in this appeal, and in  my  view  were
    not open to criticism.

 9. The basis of this second appeal by the Home Office is that,  in  making
    his 'unduly harsh' findings, the judge had not  taken  account  of  the
    public interest as required by the authorities. A robust view would  be
    simply to say that he had done that the first time round,  and  saw  no
    need to repeat himself; the only possible reason not to decide the case
    on that basis is that there were at one  time  competing  views  to  be
    found in reported decisions of the Upper Tribunal  as  to  whether  the
    'unduly harsh' question included the public interest or not.

10. Although the judge did not refer to either of these  decisions,  it  is
    theoretically  possible, and might have explained his  not  saying  any
    more about the public interest, that he might  have  had  in  mind  the
    decision now wholly superseded by KMO  (section  117  -  unduly  harsh)
    [2015] UKUT 543 (IAC), since that has been approved  by  the  Court  of
    Appeal in MM (Uganda)  (2016, so far not reported,  beyond  the  Lawtel
    summary produced by Mr Kotas). This makes it perfectly clear  that  the
    public interest is part of the  'unduly  harsh'  question,  both  under
    paragraph 399 and s. 117C. However, KMO   had  in  any  case  been  the
    preferred decision of the Upper Tribunal for some time, and  I  see  no
    real reason to suppose that the judge was taking  any  different  view,
    having already carried out the  necessary  balancing  exercise  on  the
    facts (see 5) in his first decision, which he made part of the  present
    one.

11. Fresh decision  In case I were  wrong  about  that,  and  there  was  a
    material error of law by the judge in his second decision, I  set  out,
    de bene esse, to re-make it; again it was agreed that I should do so on
    the basis of his findings of fact. These are very clearly  set  out  at
    paragraph 16 of his original decision, repeated at paragraph 8  of  the
    present one, with further remarks at paragraph 7. While in my view  the
    long  residence  in  this  country  of  all  the  children  would   not
    necessarily be enough  on  its  own  to  outweigh  the  serious  public
    interest in removing this appellant, that is far from the  only  factor
    on his side of the scales. As the judge's original paragraph  16  makes
    clear, not only do D and A have serious  problems  of  their  own,  but
    having to cope with them has resulted in  real  difficulties  for  both
    their mother and T.

12. These difficulties could only be made worse for  the  children  by  the
    removal of the appellant, either by their losing his  support  in  this
    country, or by having to follow him to Jamaica, a  country  with  which
    they have had very little contact, and that, in D's case, of an adverse
    kind. It might well be said that their mother's  own  interests  should
    count for little in a case of this kind; but D and  A  still  need  her
    care, and in their case are likely to do so for the foreseeable future.
    T will be grown-up soon; but he cannot be expected to bear more than  a
    part of that burden, and the mother needs support in looking after  the
    others.

13. Against that, there is what I (and the judge) have  already  recognized
    as the strong public interest in removing those who deal in  class  'A'
    drugs. The facts on this  are  best  taken  from  the  remarks  of  the
    sentencing judge herself. The appellant was approached  in  a  cafï¿½  in
    2010 by an undercover police officer, who he supplied with two wraps of
    cocaine, from a stock he was keeping in his mouth. He  claimed  to  his
    probation officer that he was only selling to finance  his  own  habit,
    and pled not guilty to supplying,  it  is  not  clear  on  what  basis.
    However, he was convicted by the  jury,  and  the  judge  rejected  the
    explanation he had given.

14. In other words, this appellant was a street-dealer  for  gain,  to  the
    danger of himself and others. Probably he would have received a  longer
    sentence, once the 2012 guidelines were in force; but  the  judge  made
    clear that the main point in his favour was that  he  had  no  previous
    convictions for drug-related offences, though  he  did  have  some  for
    driving whilst disqualified and what she (and I would agree)  described
    as 'relatively minor offences'.

15. In the very unusual circumstances of this case, I agree with the  judge
    that it would be unduly harsh to T, D and A to remove  this  appellant,
    either in terms of their having to go and live with him in Jamaica,  or
    of their staying here without him.
