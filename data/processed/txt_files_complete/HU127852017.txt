For the Appellant:     Mr Rees of Counsel, instructed by Chris & Co
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr McGirr, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Jamaica born on 5  December  1966.   She
    arrived in the United  Kingdom  as  a  visitor  on  11  July  1999  and
    subsequently extended her leave to remain as a student and made further
    applications, which resulted in reconsideration and a refusal to  grant
    further leave dated 17 August  2011.  The  Appellant  was  subsequently
    served with documentation as an overstayer in  2016  and  made  further
    human rights applications.  The Respondent,  in  a  decision  dated  12
    October 2017, refused her leave  to  remain.   The  Appellant  appealed
    against this decision and her appeal came before Judge  M  A  Khan  for
    hearing on 23 August 2018.  In a decision and reasons promulgated on  3
    September 2018 the judge dismissed the appeal finding it would  not  be
    disproportionate for her to return to Jamaica.

 2. Permission to appeal was sought on the basis that the  judge  had  made
    material errors of law: firstly, in adopting a  mean-spirited  approach
    to certain aspects of the evidence cf. TF and MA [2018] CSIH 58 at  30.
    Examples of this were in  relation  to  the  judge's  approach  to  the
    evidence of the Appellant's son at [19] and [21] and  the  evidence  of
    the Appellant's daughter at [22] to [23]; secondly,  it  was  submitted
    that the judge had erred in his analysis of whether, following Dasgupta
    [2016] UKUT 28 (IAC) the Appellant is one of the primary carers of  her
    granddaughter, given that her daughter works full-time and whether this
    amounted to family life over and above normal family ties; thirdly,  it
    was submitted that the judge had erred materially in  law  in  applying
    the incorrect legal test when looking at the Appellant's  private  life
    under the Rules pursuant to paragraph 276ADE.  It was asserted that the
    Judge focussed on subparagraph (iii) when it was  not  the  Appellant's
    case that she had resided in the UK for  more  than  twenty  years  but
    rather  whether  there  were  very   significant   obstacles   to   her
    reintegration in Jamaica.  In this respect, the judge further erred  in
    applying  the  test  of  insurmountable  obstacles  rather  than   very
    significant obstacles  and  the  judge  further  failed  to  apply  the
    principles set out by the Court of Appeal in Kamara [2016] EWCA Civ 813
    at 14; fourthly, it was submitted that the judge had erred  in  failing
    to engage with the impact of removal of the Appellant on the  remainder
    of her family, in particular her adult children and  her  granddaughter
    given that they all reside together cf. Beoku-Betts [2008] UKHL 39.

 3. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Ford in a
    decision dated 2 October 2018 with reference to the  second  to  fourth
    grounds of appeal.

 4. In his submissions before the Upper Tribunal, Mr Rees sought to rely on
    the grounds of appeal as pleaded.  He began with the  third  ground  of
    appeal and the fact that the judge had applied the wrong legal test  in
    respect of 276ADE(vi) of the Rules and that the judge had simply failed
    to  address  the  question  of  whether  there  were  very  significant
    obstacles to the Appellant's reintegration in Jamaica, given  that  she
    had been living in the UK continuously for nineteen years at  the  date
    of hearing in August 2018.  He submitted that the judge had  failed  to
    apply the principles in Kamara (op  cit)  and  the  need  for  a  broad
    evaluative judgment.   Little  consideration  had  been  given  to  the
    obstacles she might face  on  return  after  such  a  long  time.   The
    Appellant was very vulnerable and would be returning  alone  without  a
    job and a home and would remain financially dependent on her family  in
    the UK with very limited prospect of obtaining employment.

 5. In relation to the fourth ground of appeal, Mr Rees submitted that  the
    judge had failed to engage with the principles in Beoku-Betts (op  cit)
    and had failed to take into account the impact on the remainder of  the
    Appellant's family, in particular given that the  Appellant,  her  son,
    daughter and granddaughter all live together and they are a very close-
    knot family.  Mr Rees sought to rely  on  the  decision  of  the  Upper
    Tribunal in Dasgupta (op cit) and also the  Strasbourg  authorities  of
    GHB v the UK Application no. 42455/98 and Marckx v Belgium [1979]  ECHR
    2. The judge failed to consider  those  authorities,  nor  any  of  the
    Kugathas [2003] EWCA Civ  31  line  of  authorities  including  Ghising
    [2013] UKUT 00567 (IAC) and RP (Zimbabwe) [2008] EWCA Civ 825 and  that
    this was a material error.

 6. Mr Rees submitted that the judge was materially incorrect to find  that
    Article 8 was not engaged at [35] in light of this evidence,  nor  does
    he consider section 55 of the BCIA 2009 in relation to the  Appellant's
    granddaughter, despite the fact that she is  the  major  carer  of  the
    child  and  clearly  modern  methods  of  communication  would  not  be
    appropriate given that she is only 1 year of age.

 7. In relation to the "mean  spirited  approach"  asserted  in  the  first
    ground of appeal, Mr Rees submitted that the fundamental point was that
    the evidence of the witnesses had to be considered  in  the  round  and
    that did not happen.  The judge had  not  been  entirely  fair  to  the
    witnesses in suggesting that there was  inconsistency  when  there  was
    not.

 8. In his submissions, Mr McGirr accepted that the judge had  not  applied
    the correct test in  relation  to  276ADE(vi)  of  the  Rules,  but  he
    submitted it was not material in that, on the  basis  of  the  evidence
    before the judge, the Appellant was a very healthy normal person,  does
    not seem to be vulnerable in any way and there was no evidence to  show
    that she could not have a normal  life  in  Jamaica.   Her  immigration
    history shows that the Appellant has been an overstayer  all  the  time
    she has been here and whilst it was not disputed that she has a  family
    life with her adult children and granddaughter, the issue is whether it
    was sufficient to engage Article 8 and  whether  there  are  more  than
    normal emotional ties and he submitted that that test was not met.

 9. In reply, Mr Rees submitted that the evidence  strongly  suggests  that
    the level of family life between the Appellant and her  grandchild  was
    very strong and whilst being a carer in itself does not engage  Article
    8, one needs to look at the whole situation and given the mother of the
    baby is in full-time work it was clear that Article 8  was  engaged  on
    the facts and evidence and that more than normal  emotional  ties  were
    present.

10. Mr Rees submitted  it  was  self-evident  that  the  Appellant  was  an
    overstayer. He submitted that Mr McGirr had accepted the judge made  an
    error and this  was  material  given  that  there  was  an  absence  of
    consideration of whether there were very significant obstacles  to  the
    Appellant's  integration  in  Jamaica  which  was  the  very  basis  of
    paragraph 276ADE(vi) of the Rules.  He submitted there would be a  huge
    contrast between the Appellant's life in the UK where she is very well-
    integrated and her life in Jamaica where she has no home to go  to  and
    would be in serious difficulties.

     Decision and Reasons

11. I find material errors of law in the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge M A Khan.  Firstly, I find that the failure to apply the  correct
    test in relation to paragraph 276ADE(vi) of the Immigration Rules is  a
    material error.  It is of concern that, despite summarising  the  basis
    of the refusal decision and the issues  under  appeal  at  [5]  of  the
    decision and reasons, the reference therein is  to  whether  there  are
    insurmountable obstacles for the Appellant to reintegrate  in  Jamaica.
    There is no direct reference to paragraph 276ADE(vi)  at  all.  In  the
    section of the decision setting out  the  judge's  conclusions  in  the
    appeal, there is no  reference  to  paragraph  276ADE(vi)  nor  to  the
    relevant test of whether there are very significant  obstacles  to  the
    Appellant's integration.  It follows  that  there  is  no  analysis  of
    whether or not the factors that the Appellant sought to rely on  amount
    to very significant obstacles.

12. Whilst that, in itself, is sufficient to set aside the decision I  will
    go on to address the further grounds of appeal. At [32] the judge finds
    "their family life with the Appellant is no more that normal  emotional
    ties," however, no reasons are provided  for  that  finding  which,  in
    light of the fact that the  Appellant  is  the  primary  carer  of  her
    granddaughter whilst  her  daughter  is  working  and  given  that  the
    Appellant resides with her  son,  daughter  and  granddaughter  I  find
    amounts to a material error of law in that more  by  way  of  reasoning
    needed to have been provided so that the parties can understand why the
    judge reached that  conclusion.   I  further  find  that  there  is  no
    consideration of the potential impact on the Appellant's adult children
    and granddaughter  if  she  were  to  be  removed  to  Jamaica  and  no
    consideration of the House of Lords judgment in Beoku-Betts.

13. Looking at the judge's findings as a whole, whilst there  is  reference
    to the public interest considerations set out at sections 117A-D of the
    NIAA 2002, there is no proportionality analysis,  despite  the  judge's
    reference to the judgment in Razgar [2004] UKHL 27 at [34].   Whilst  I
    take note of the submissions and reliance on the judgment in TF and  MA
    [2018] CSIH 58 at [30] I find that the judge's  comment  at  [32]  that
    "the Appellant's daughter is more  concerned  about  the  care  of  her
    daughter than anything else it is more about the Appellant acting as  a
    carer  for  her  granddaughter  than  the  Appellant's  wellbeing"  may
    potentially fall into the category of being "mean spirited" given  that
    the evidence of the Appellant's daughter went above and beyond the fact
    that the Appellant looks after her daughter  whilst  she  is  at  work,
    although clearly this was an important issue for her in her evidence.

14. In respect of the evidence of the Appellant's  son,  his  evidence  was
    that he would support her and visit his mother if she had  to  relocate
    to Jamaica, but that he would struggle to do so given that he also  had
    to support himself and his sister on his income of �25,000 a year.  The
    judge held at [31]: "I am  not  impressed  with  the  evidence  of  the
    Appellant's son based on an erroneous understanding of his evidence  as
    to his ability to financially support his mother". I find that more  in
    the way of reasoning was required to justify this finding.

     Notice of Decision

15. For the reasons set out above, I find material errors  of  law  in  the
    decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge M A Khan.  I  set  that  decision
    aside and remit the appeal for a hearing de novo at York House.

16. There is no order for anonymity in this case.
