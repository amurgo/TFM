               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

For the Appellant:       Ms J Norman, Counsel instructed by Sterling and Co
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Harrison, Senior Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    This matter  comes  before  me  pursuant  to  permission  having  been
    granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Osborne dated 4 January 2016.  The
    appeal relates to a decision by  Designated  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal S J Pacey promulgated on 20 August 2015. The  Judge  dismissed
    the appeal against the Respondent's decision refusing  his  application
    for variation of leave on the basis of family life with his wife.

2.    The background to the Respondent's decision dated  5  March  2015  was
    that the Appellant's wife's income, said to be �23,905, was not  proved
    in  accordance  with  the  requirements  of  the   Immigration   Rules.
    Additionally it was said that the as there  were  no  British  children
    then  there  were  no  insurmountable  obstacles  to  the  relationship
    continuing from India or by  the  Appellant  seeking  to  re-enter  the
    United Kingdom by making an application for entry clearance whilst  his
    wife, his sponsor, remained in the United Kingdom.

3.    Ms Norman said that the grounds of appeal which had been  relied  upon
    were broad ranging but there were material errors of law in respect  of
    Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and in respect  of
    section 117 of the Nationality Immigration and  Asylum  Act  2002.  She
    said that she had spoken to Mr  Harrison  and  there  was  not  a  huge
    difference between them.

4.    Ms Norman said that the Appellant's wife did meet the requirements  to
    prove her �23,000 income. The issue was whether cash payments could  be
    accepted. This was referred to at paragraph 13 of the Judge's decision.
    The concession that the income threshold requirements were not met then
    was wrongly made. All of the documents were  there.  It  was  therefore
    asserted that the income  from  Subway  should  have  been  taken  into
    account.

5.     It  was  submitted  that  therefore  because  the  Income   Threshold
    requirement was met then there was no need to go on to proportionality.
    In any event the issues of immigration control and the  economic  well-
    being of the country had been conflated.

6.    The second matter related to paragraph  16  of  the  Judge's  decision
    where he had applied the wrong test. The Judge said, "would  face  very
    significant obstacles to integration" but  that  relates  to  Paragraph
    276ADE whereas EX1 asks are there insurmountable  obstacles.  It  is  a
    holistic test. It was submitted this was a material error of law.

7.    In relation to paragraph 17 of the Judge's decision and the  reference
    to s117 NIAA 2002, there was no consideration that the income threshold
    had been met. Little weight was given to  private  life  and  that  was
    entirely wrong.

8.    Mr Harrison in his reply said that he was grateful to  Ms  Norman  for
    her clear explanation of the Appellant's grounds  of  appeal.  He  said
    that he was content to rely on the Rule 24 Reply  which  addressed  the
    issues.  The Rule 24 Reply said that the Judge's decision ought  to  be
    upheld.  It was agreed that the evidential requirements of Appendix FM-
    SE could not be met. The Judge had also undertaken a  Razgar  balancing
    exercise. In so far as the Appellant having to make an application  for
    entry  clearance  is  concerned,  there  was  extensive  references  to
    passages in the Upper Tribunal's decision in R (on the  application  of
    Chen) v Secretary of  State  for  the  Home  Department  (Appendix  FM-
    Chikwamba-temporary separation-proportionality) IJr [2015[  UKUT  00189
    (IAC). It was said that a pregnancy of three  weeks  cannot  amount  to
    exceptional circumstances.

9.     I had reserved my decision.

10.   It is the withdrawal of the concession in respect of Appendix  FM  and
    the financial  requirements  that  affects  this  case.  There  was  no
    opposition to the withdrawal of that concession and I see no  basis  to
    interfere in the discussions that Ms Norman and Mr Harrison  had  about
    that.

11.   If Ms  Norman  is  right  that  the  Appellant's  wife  did  meet  the
    evidential requirements in respect of her claimed �23,950  income  then
    that significantly affects the outcome which ought to have resulted.  I
    do not have sufficient information before me to  come  to  a  concluded
    view as to whether or not the evidential requirements were met.

12.   The basis upon which the appeal is  put  before  me  is  that  if  the
    evidential requirements were met then this would have affected not only
    the Immigration Rules aspect of the appeal, but also the way  in  which
    Article 8 and section 117 NIAA would be  considered.  That  is  because
    there would be no issue in respect of the income  aspects  and  thereby
    the economic well-being of the country.

13.   Therefore it is not only the issue of  the  Appellant's  wife's  three
    week pregnancy that now features at the centre of this appeal. I  agree
    with the Rule 24 in that respect which states that a pregnancy of three
    weeks cannot be an exceptional reason for the purposes  of  R  (on  the
    application of) Agyarko v Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department
    [2015] EWCA Civ 400 and SS (Congo) v Secretary of State  for  the  Home
    Department [2015] EWCA Civ 387.  The lens through which the  Judge  was
    making his assessment though  was  based  on  an  apparently  incorrect
    concession in respect of the Appellant's wife's  earnings  and  whether
    the cash payments from her employment could or could not be taken  into
    account for the purposes of the requirements of Appendix FM-SE.

14.   Therefore in view of the concession and in view  of  the  approach  of
    the parties before me in respect of that concession, I find there is  a
    material error of law. I therefore allow the appeal in respect of  both
    the Immigration Rules  and  Article  8.  The  matter  is  remitted  for
    rehearing before the First-tier Tribunal.
