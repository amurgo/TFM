                          DECISION AND REASONS (P)

 1. The parties have agreed that this appeal is suitable for  determination
    on the papers.  Having regard to their views and to Osborn v The Parole
    Board [2014] 1 AC 1115 and considering  the  over-riding  objective  of
    dealing with cases fairly and justly, I also consider that  to  be  the
    appropriate method of disposal.

Background

 2. The appellant is a Brazilian national who was born on  17  April  1995.
    She appeals,  with  permission  granted  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal,
    against a decision which was issued by  Judge  Hussain  on  4  November
    2019, dismissing her appeal against the  respondent's  refusal  of  her
    human rights claim.

 3. The appellant is married to another Brazilian national called  Juan  De
    Alemida Lima.  Mr Lima ("the sponsor") is  employed  by  the  Universal
    Church of the Kingdom of God.  He held leave to remain under Tier 2  of
    the Points Based System ("PBS") in reliance on that employment.  On  27
    September 2016, the appellant entered the United Kingdom holding  entry
    clearance as the spouse of a Tier 2 Migrant.  The leave to enter  which
    was duly conferred was valid until 6 December 2018.

 4. The sponsor duly completed five years'  residence  under  the  PBS  and
    applied for Indefinite Leave to Remain.  Whilst that was  pending,  the
    appellant made her own application for leave to remain as the spouse of
    a settled person under Appendix  FM  of  the  Immigration  Rules.   The
    sponsor was granted ILR but the appellant's  application  was  refused.
    There was a single ground of  refusal  under  the  Five-Year  Route  in
    Appendix FM:

         'The circumstances of your family in the United Kingdom require you
         to demonstrate that you meet the financial requirement  of  �18600.
         You have failed to demonstrate that you or  your  partner  have  an
         annual  income  of  �18600,  either  separately  or  with  combined
         earnings.  You therefore fail to fulfil E-LTRP 3.1 to E-LTRP 3.3 of
         Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.'

 5. The respondent went on to conclude, under  the  Ten  Year  Route,  that
    there were no insurmountable obstacles to  family  life  continuing  in
    Brazil; that there would  be  no  very  significant  obstacles  to  the
    appellant's re-integration; and that  the  appellant's  removal  was  a
    proportionate course of action under Article 8 ECHR.


 6. An appeal was lodged.  Whilst the appeal was pending,  the  appellant's
    solicitors made two requests for reconsideration. In the first, it  was
    submitted  that  the  decision  under  challenge  was  wrong,  for  the
    following reason:

         "As per the Employment letter dated 10 December 2018,  the  Sponsor
         Spouse is employed by the Universal Church of the  Kingdom  of  God
         (UKCG) and receives total salary  package  of  �30,000  per  annum.
         This package is made up of a basic salary  of  �16,800  per  annual
         (sic) and then a further accommodation  allowance  of  �13,200  per
         annum (�1,100 per month)."

 7. It was submitted that the two sums,  in  combination,  were  more  than
    sufficient to meet the requirement of �18,600 and that paragraph 18  of
    Appendix FM-SE permitted the appellant to rely on the total package.


 8. On 29 May 2019, the respondent  refused  the  reconsideration  request.
    Although she accepted that there was a basic salary of �16,800, she did
    not accept that the �13,200 could be counted towards the Minimum Income
    Threshold ("MIR").  She  reached  that  conclusion  for  the  following
    reasons:

         "�13,200  accommodation  allowance  is   rejected.    Contract   of
         employment stated 'free accommodation'.  No mention is made of  any
         nominal charge, there is no evidence the Appellant has received the
         �13,200 as an income and no evidence it has been paid  back  as  an
         accommodation cost."

The Appeal to the First-tier Tribunal

 9. The appeal therefore came before  Judge  M  B  Hussain  ("the  judge"),
    sitting at Taylor House on 13 September 2019.  He received  bundles  of
    documents from both  parties  and  he  heard  oral  evidence  from  the
    appellant, the sponsor and the HR manager  of  UKCG,  Lisa  Hodgkinson.
    The evidence which was focused on the  point  at  issue  was  that  the
    sponsor received a remuneration package  which  included  accommodation
    which was paid for by the church, directly to the landlord.


10. In his reserved decision, the judge concluded that  the  appellant  was
    not entitled  (for  the  purposes  of  Appendix  FM)  to  rely  on  the
    'accommodation  allowance'  which  was  provided  by  the  church.   In
    reaching that conclusion, the judge attached particular significance to
    paragraph 18(c)  of  Appendix  FM-SE.   He  therefore  found  that  the
    appellant was unable to satisfy the Immigration Rules.  In  considering
    the appeal with reference to Article 8 ECHR itself, the judge concluded
    that aspects of s117B of the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum  Act
    2002 militated against  the  appellant  and  that  the  respondent  had
    established that her decision was proportionate.

The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

11. There are  two  grounds  of  appeal.   The  first  is  that  the  judge
    misdirected himself in law in concluding that the appellant  could  not
    satisfy Appendix FM in the manner set out above.  The  second  is  that
    the  judge  misdirected  himself  in   law   in   his   assessment   of
    proportionality  outside  the  Immigration   Rules,   with   particular
    reference to the Public Interest Considerations in s117B  of  the  2002
    Act.


12. The papers were placed before Upper Tribunal Judge Gill at  the  height
    of the pandemic.  Judge Gill  formed  the  provisional  view  that  the
    appeal might properly be considered  on  the  papers,  and  she  issued
    standard form directions seeking the  views  of  the  parties  on  that
    course of action and on the merits of the appeal.

13. Submissions were received from the respondent (written by Mr  Whitwell,
    a  Senior  Presenting  Officer)  but  nothing  was  received  from  the
    appellant.  The papers were then placed  before  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    Sheridan, who was concerned by the  absence  of  submissions  from  the
    appellant's solicitors.  In light of the pandemic, he extended time for
    their submissions.  Written submissions were  duly  received  from  the
    appellant's solicitors.  Insofar as it is necessary to extend time  yet
    further, I am satisfied that it is appropriate to do so in light of the
    pandemic-related difficulties set out by the appellant's solicitors.

Submissions


14.  It  is  submitted  by  the  appellant  that  the  sponsor  receives  a
    contractual allowance for accommodation and  that  it  may  be  counted
    towards  the  calculation  of  the  Financial  Requirements.    It   is
    submitted, as it was before the FtT, that the accommodation is part  of
    the  sponsor's  salary  package  and  that  there  is  nothing  in  the
    Immigration Rules which prohibits reliance on such a sum.  In  relation
    to ground two, it is submitted that the judge erred in his  application
    of s117B(3) of the 2002 Act because the appellant is not  a  burden  on
    the public purse and this provision did not weigh against  her  in  the
    scales of proportionality.

15. For the respondent, Mr Whitwell submits  that  the  judge  decided  the
    point under Appendix FM correctly.  The sponsor did not receive  a  sum
    of money in addition to his basic salary and the additional  sum  could
    not properly count towards the calculation required by the  Immigration
    Rules.  In relation to ground two, it is  accepted  by  the  respondent
    that the judge erred in law in his  approach  to  s117B(3)  but  it  is
    submitted that the error was not a material one.


Analysis

16. I am satisfied that the judge erred in law in two respects.  His  first
    error was to conclude that  the  free  accommodation  provided  to  the
    sponsor by the church fell under paragraph  18(c)  of  Appendix  FM-SE.
    Paragraphs 18(a)-(c) are as follows:

    '(18)     When  calculating  income  from  salaried  employment   under
         paragraphs 12A and 13 to 16, this paragraph applies:


         (a)  Basic pay,  skills-based  allowances,  and  UK  location-based
             allowances will be counted as income provided that:


             (i)  They are contractual; and


             (ii) Where these allowances make up more than 30% of the total
                  salary, only the amount up to 30% is counted.


         (b)  Overtime, payments to cover travel time, commission-based  pay
             and bonuses (which can include tips and gratuities paid via  a
             tronc scheme registered with HMRC) will be counted as  income,
             where they have been received in  the  relevant  period(s)  of
             employment or self-employment relied upon in the application.


         (bb) In respect of a person in salaried employment at the  date  of
             application, the amount of income in sub-paragraph  (b)  which
             may be added to their gross annual salary, and counted as part
             of that figure for  the  purposes  of  paragraph  13(a)(i)  or
             13(b)(i), is the annual equivalent  of  the  person's  average
             gross  monthly  income  from  that  income  in  their  current
             employment in the 6 months prior to the date of application.


         (c)  Payments relating to the  costs  of  UK  or  overseas  travel,
             including (for example) travelling or relocation expenses  and
             subsistence or accommodation  allowances,  and  payments  made
             towards the costs of living overseas, will not be  counted  as
             income.'

17. Sub-paragraph (c) is not concerned with the free  provision  of  living
    accommodation in this country.  As is clear from its first  ten  words,
    the sub-paragraph is designed to ensure that the costs of travel inside
    and outside the UK are not to count as income under Appendix  FM.   The
    rationale for that is quite clear: those are payments which are made as
    and when necessary, so as to ensure that an  employee  is  not  out  of
    pocket as a result of employment-related travel.  The sums in  question
    arise when an employee travels away from their home at  the  employer's
    request; this paragraph has nothing to do with the free provision of  a
    home, as provided to the sponsor by UKCG in this case.


18.  It  seems,  unfortunately,  that  the  judge  focused  on  the   words
    'accommodation allowance' in paragraph 18(c), and concluded  that  this
    was precisely what was provided by UKCG for the sponsor.  To do so  was
    to take those words out of the context in which they  appear,  however.
    Had the judge taken the context provided by the paragraph into account,
    he would not have concluded that the  sponsor  was  in  receipt  of  an
    'accommodation allowance' which was caught by this provision, which  is
    directed to accommodation costs incidental to travel.


19. I am not satisfied the judge's error was material to his analysis under
    the Immigration Rules, however.  Even if paragraph 18(c) did not  apply
    to the accommodation received by the sponsor, it is  quite  clear  that
    the rent for that accommodation - which is paid by the church -  cannot
    count towards the calculation performed under Appendix FM and FM-SE.  I
    have set out a substantial part of paragraph 18 because  the  part  set
    out above shows that what matters, for the purpose of this Appendix, is
    the sustainable income received  by  an  individual.   Salary  payments
    provide the baseline income and the respondent permits - via  paragraph
    18 - various other types of payment from employer to employee to  count
    for these purposes.

20. Contractually agreed London Allowance or a  Recruitment  and  Retention
    Allowance would be permitted, for example, because they represent forms
    of payment which might  be  depended  upon  for  the  future.   In  the
    appellant's case, however, the sponsor is not entitled  to  a  specific
    sum by way of additional income; what he is contractually  entitled  to
    is  nothing  more  and   nothing   less   than   accommodation.    That
    accommodation might be worth �1100 per month  but  it  might  be  worth
    significantly more or significantly less.  It might, in particular,  be
    worth significantly less if the church exercised its right to rely upon
    paragraph 12(e) of the Trainee Assistant Pastor's Code  of  Honour  and
    Conduct (a copy of which was before the FtT):

         'The Assistant Pastor understand that the  Church  is  a  religious
         community and he will  be  required  to  share  accommodation  with
         fellow Assistant Pastors and their families.'

21. There is no reason to doubt what was said by the Church in relation  to
    the accommodation, which is that it paid rent of �1100 per month.   But
    the Church could, at any time, introduce  additional  people  into  the
    property, as a result of which the amount of rent due for  the  sponsor
    (and the appellant) would be reduced  proportionately.   Alternatively,
    given what is guaranteed is accommodation and not  a  sum,  the  Church
    would be quite within its rights to move the sponsor and the  appellant
    to accommodation which is considerably cheaper than  �1100  per  month.
    Ultimately, therefore, it would be wrong to see the sum currently  paid
    by the church to the sponsor's landlord as part  of  his  income  under
    Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.  For  those  reasons,  which  are
    different from those relied upon by the  judge,  I  consider  that  his
    error was immaterial to  the  outcome  of  the  appeal  insofar  as  it
    depended upon the appellant's ability to meet the Five Year Route.


22. It is accepted by the respondent that the judge  erred  as  claimed  in
    ground two.  It is not necessary  to  set  out  s117B(3)  in  full;  it
    provides that it is in the public  interest  that  those  who  seek  to
    remain in the UK are financially independent.  In Rhuppiah [2018] 1 WLR
    5536, the Supreme Court accepted the concession made by the  respondent
    in that case that the Court  of  Appeal  had  erred  in  upholding  the
    decisions reached below insofar as it had concluded that a  person  was
    required by s117B(3) to be financially independent  of  another.   What
    was required, instead, was that the individual should not be  a  burden
    on the state.  It follows that the judge erred in concluding at [29] of
    his decision that s117B(3) militated against the appellant because  she
    did not meet the income threshold under the Immigration  Rules.   There
    has never been any suggestion that the appellant represents a burden to
    the public pursue, even if she is unable to meet the MIR.


23. It follows from that  conclusion  that  the  judge  erred  in  entering
    s117B(3) on the 'balance sheet' of considerations which  were  relevant
    to his proportionality assessment.   That  is  necessarily  a  material
    error of law.  I set aside the decision of the FtT in that respect, and
    I shall remake the decision on the appeal on the basis of the  material
    which was before the FtT.

24. The appropriate starting point is that the appellant does not meet  the
    requirements of the Five-Year Route under Appendix FM for the reasons I
    have given above.  I should perhaps add that there was a second  string
    to her bow under the Five Year Route, which was that  her  husband  had
    recently been made a full Pastor which UKCG, with  an  income  of  just
    over the MIR.  The judge did not accept that he was entitled to  attach
    weight to that claim due to a paucity of evidence.  There is no  appeal
    against that finding, which was properly open to the judge and was,  in
    any event, inevitable.

25. The appellant is also unable to meet the requirements of  the  Ten-Year
    Route.  She is unable to establish that there would  be  insurmountable
    obstacles to the  continuation  of  her  family  life  in  Brazil.   In
    fairness to the appellant and the solicitors who have  represented  her
    throughout, the contrary was not really asserted before the FtT.  There
    is no apparent reason why it would  cause  the  very  serious  hardship
    required by paragraph EX2  of  Appendix  FM  for  these  two  Brazilian
    nationals to return to Brazil.

26. Nor  can  the  appellant  meet  the  Private  Life  provisions  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  There is no proper evidential basis for  concluding
    that she would have very significant difficulties in reintegrating into
    life in Brazil and the fact that she left there only four years  or  so
    ago would strongly suggest the opposite.

27. Given these conclusions, it is for the appellant to show that there are
    exceptional circumstances which might warrant leave  being  granted  on
    Article 8 ECHR grounds.  It is not for the appellant to show  that  she
    surmounts  a  legal  threshold  of  exceptionality,  however;  what  is
    required is a proportionality assessment and what she must show is that
    her removal would give rise to  unjustifiably  harsh  consequences:  GM
    (Sri Lanka) [2019] EWCA Civ 1630, at [29].  In order  to  conduct  that
    balancing exercise, it is important to have  a  clear  picture  of  the
    matters weighing for and against removal.


28. On the appellant's side of the scales is the disruption which would  be
    caused to her and her husband, and to their duties within  the  church,
    in the event of removal.  They had hoped to make their home in  the  UK
    and they have both contributed significantly to the church's work.   Ms
    Hodgkinson gave unchallenged evidence before the FtT about the outreach
    work undertaken by the appellant  and  his  wife,  which  has  involves
    providing support for women who have suffered domestic abuse.  She also
    noted in her evidence that there is  a  shortage  of  pastors  in  this
    country, which is why the UKCG recruited people from overseas.


29. This is therefore not a case -  such  as  Rhuppiah's  -  in  which  the
    removal of the appellant from the United Kingdom would bring about very
    severe consequences for the  appellant  or  for  another  person.   The
    appellant and her husband would be faced with an invidious choice -  of
    her leaving the country alone or of  them  relocating  together  -  and
    there would be a gap in the provision offered by the church, given  the
    role the appellant and the sponsor have played in the community  for  a
    number of years.

30. The material question is whether those consequences  are  unjustifiably
    harsh on the facts of this individual case.  Against those consequences
    I must weigh the Public Interest Considerations in Part 5A of the  2002
    Act.  The appellant speaks English and is not a burden  on  the  public
    purse.  She has never been in the  country  unlawfully  (her  leave  is
    extended by operation of section 3C of  the  Immigration  Act  1971  at
    present).  She has been in the UK on a precarious basis but it is clear
    from recent Court of Appeal authority that this does not weigh  against
    her under s117B(5), since that provision catches only private life: Lal
    v SSHD [2020] 1 WLR 858.

31. The only provision, therefore,  which  weighs  positively  against  the
    appellant is s11B(1) of the 2002 Act, which states that the maintenance
    of effective immigration control is in the public interest.   I  remind
    myself that I must  accord  considerable  weight  to  the  respondent's
    policy, as expressed in the Immigration Rules, at a general level.  The
    appellant is unable to meet the requirements of the  Immigration  Rules
    and this is necessarily a matter which counts against her.

32. I also remind myself of what was said by Lady Hale  and  Lord  Carnwath
    (with whom the other Justices agreed) at  [99]-[100]  of  MM  (Lebanon)
    [2017] 1 WLR 771.  Having concluded that the  amended  Rules  were  not
    irrational in the common law sense, they continued:

         "[99]    Operation of the same  restrictive  approach  outside  the
         rules is a different matter, and in our view is much more difficult
         to justify under the HRA. This  is  not  because  "less  intrusive"
         methods might be devised (as Blake J attempted to  do:  para  147),
         but because it is inconsistent with  the  character  of  evaluation
         which article 8 requires. As has been seen,  avoiding  a  financial
         burden on the state can be relevant to the fair balance required by
         the article. But that judgment cannot properly be constrained by  a
         rigid restriction in the rules. Certainly, nothing that is said  in
         the instructions to case  officers  can  prevent  the  tribunal  on
         appeal from looking at the  matter  more  broadly.  These  are  not
         matters of policy on which special weight has to be accorded to the
         judgment of the Secretary of State. There is nothing to prevent the
         tribunal, in the context of the HRA appeal, from judging for itself
         the reliability of any alternative sources of finance in the  light
         of the evidence before it. In doing  so,  it  will  no  doubt  take
         account of such considerations as those discussed by Lord Brown and
         Lord Kerr in Mahad, including the difficulties of proof highlighted
         in the quotation from Collins J. That being the position before the
         tribunal, it would make little sense  for  decision-makers  at  the
         earlier stages to be forced to take a narrower approach which  they
         might be unable to defend on appeal."

33. This is a case, in my judgment, where it is necessary to bear  in  mind
    that Article 8 ECHR is to be considered more  broadly  than  under  the
    Immigration Rules.  The appellant and the sponsor are not  entitled  to
    rely on the  provision  of  free  accommodation  in  order  to  satisfy
    Appendix FM; that is the plain and ordinary meaning of the Rules.  I am
    entirely satisfied, however, considering the evidence of Ms  Hodgkinson
    and the Code of Honour and Conduct to which I have referred above, that
    the appellant and the sponsor will continue to be  provided  with  free
    accommodation for as long as he remains employed by  UKCG.   Given  the
    proportion  of  income  which  is  spent  by  most  people   on   their
    accommodation,  this  is  a  valuable  benefit.   To  discount  it   in
    considering the weight which I should attach to immigration control  in
    this particular case would lead to unacceptable results.  An individual
    who earns �18,600 per annum but  pays  �1100  in  rent  would  be  left
    (discounting any tax) with �450 in his pocket.  An individual  such  as
    the appellant, who earns �16,800 and pays no rent is left with �1400 in
    his pocket.  The Immigration Rules  enable  the  former  individual  to
    sponsor his spouse successfully, but not the latter.


34. I am entirely satisfied that the relationship between the  sponsor  and
    his  church  is  not  a  contrivance,  since  that  has  been  accepted
    throughout by the respondent, who has granted him limited leave and ILR
    in reliance on  that  relationship.   I  am  also  satisfied  that  the
    provision of free accommodation is part of the contractual relationship
    which has existed between the sponsor and the church  for  some  years.
    It is a valuable benefit  which  cannot  be  withdrawn.   Adopting  the
    broader approach required by MM (Lebanon), I am satisfied that it would
    be absurd to treat the sponsor as a person who earns less than the MIR.
     That is not to say that the Rules are irrational; the  lines  must  be
    drawn somewhere and the respondent is entitled to take  the  view  that
    cash income in cash is easier to assess than other forms of support.

35. Looking to  the  reality  of  this  individual  situation,  however,  I
    consider that the weight which can properly be attached to  immigration
    control is limited.  Balancing  the  competing  considerations  against
    each other, I come to the clear conclusion that the consequences of the
    appellant's removal would be unjustifiably harsh.   The  respondent  is
    not able to persuade me, despite the weight which is to  be  attributed
    to the failure to meet the letter of the Immigration  Rules,  that  the
    appellant's inability to meet those Rules renders her removal from  the
    United Kingdom a proportionate course of action.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the FtT involved the making of an error on a point  of  law.
I set aside the decision of the FtT and I remake the decision on the  appeal
by allowing it on Article 8 ECHR grounds.

No anonymity direction is made.
