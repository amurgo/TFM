                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS



   1. First-tier Tribunal Judge Fowell allowed  the  appellant's  appeal  on
      human rights grounds, although  he  incorrectly  described  it  as  an
      appeal against  a  decision  to  deport.  Permission  to  appeal  that
      decision was granted to the Secretary of State.


            Background


   2. Mr Bilo, an Albanian national, entered the UK  clandestinely  on  17th
      August 1999. On 18th August 1999, he claimed asylum as a  national  of
      Kosovo. His application was refused on 14th August  2002.  His  appeal
      against that decision was dismissed on 28th October 2003 and he became
      appeal rights exhausted on 11 November 2003. He did not leave the UK.


   3. In July 2010, a deportation order was signed against him.  His  appeal
      against that decision  was  dismissed  and  he  became  appeal  rights
      exhausted on 15 December 2010. Representations made on 19th March 2012
      were treated by the SSHD as an application to revoke  the  deportation
      order. That application was refused on 31 May 2012. His appeal on that
      occasion was allowed by the First-tier Tribunal panel  in  a  decision
      dated  15th  August  2012,  having  looked  at  his  family  situation
      including his marriage and his two children who at that time were aged
      28 months and almost 8 months old. The judge in that decision said


                  "...the appellant should be under  no  illusion  that  the
                  balance that we have struck on this occasion may  well  on
                  any future occasion be tipped against him if there is  any
                  repetition of similar criminal offending."


   4. Mr Bilo was then granted limited leave to remain  until  30th  October
      2015.


   5. The offences that had led to the signing of the deportation order were
      as follows:


   1. December 2005 convicted, in a false name and identity  as  an  Italian
      citizen, of driving  with  excess  alcohol,  using  a  vehicle  whilst
      uninsured (fines of �120 and �70);

   2.  30  June  2008  convicted  of  battery/common  assault  on  a  former
      girlfriend, again in the false name and identity (200 hours  Community
      Order);
   3. 13 January 2009 convicted, again in a  false  name  and  identity,  of
      possessing false document/improperly obtained identity document  (  12
      months imprisonment);
   4. 22 January 2010 convicted in  his  true  identity  of  perverting  the
      course of justice  (using  a  false  name  and  identity)  (18  months
      imprisonment);


   6. On 28th January 2016, Mr Bilo applied for  further  leave  to  remain.
      That application was refused and a decision to deport him on conducive
      grounds was made for reasons set  out  in  a  non-appealable  decision
      dated 23rd June 2016. Those reasons include his previous criminal  and
      immigration history and, since 2012, he had committed further criminal
      offences: on 19th November 2013 he was  cautioned  for  blackmail;  on
      23rd  April  2015  he  was  convicted  of  battery  and  remanded   on
      conditional bail until 1st June 2015 when he was  sentenced  to  a  12
      month Community Order, a Restraining Order- protection from harassment
      until 31st May 2016 and a Rehabilitation  Activity  requirement.  This
      was varied on 2 July 2015 and the Restraining Order - protection  from
      Harassment order discharged.


   7. Mr Bilo, through solicitors, responded to the s120 notice,  submitting
      that deportation would breach his Article 8  rights.  On  4th  October
      2016 the SSHD refused Mr Bilo's human rights claim, with  a  right  of
      appeal. It is that appeal that was before the First-tier Tribunal, and
      allowed, and against which the SSHD has  been  granted  permission  to
      appeal.


   8. The SSHD in the decision to deport acknowledges that Mr Bilo  was  not
      granted leave to remain under Part 13 of  the  Immigration  Rules  but
      asserts  that  there  continues  to  be  a  public  interest  in   the
      appellant's deportation and that his deportation remains conducive  to
      the public good.




            Error of law


   9. The SSHD sought and was granted permission to appeal  on  the  grounds
      that the First-tier Tribunal judge had failed to have any regard to Mr
      Bilo's immigration and criminal  history  when  determining  that  his
      deportation would have an unduly harsh effect on the ahis partner  and
      children. In particular the SSHD drew attention to the Court of Appeal
      decision of MM (Uganda) [2016] EWCA Civ 450 which upheld KMO (s117B  -
      unduly harsh) Nigeria [2015] UKUT 00543 (IAC). The SSHD submitted  the
      First-tier Tribunal judge  failed  to  understand  how  to  apply  the
      "unduly harsh" test - for example stating


                  "However the test is interpreted (for  which  guidance  is
                  awaited from a more senior tribunal) whether it is one  of
                  'insurmountable obstacles',  'very  serious  hardship'  or
                  very serious difficulties' that test appears to me  to  be
                  met in the present case"


  10. Although the First-tier Tribunal judge sets out extracts from  caselaw
      at great length he has approached the issue of the effect of Mr Bilo's
      deportation from the perspective the family being split. First of all,
      he fails to properly consider what "Unduly harsh" means in the context
      of deportation and Article 8 despite the number of occasions on  which
      the  Court  of  Appeal  has  pronounced  on  this,  and  the  detailed
      exposition in KMO. Secondly, having reached the decision (applying  an
      incorrect test) that it would be unduly harsh to separate the children
      from their father, he then simply states that the public  interest  is
      displaced.


  11. The failure of the First-tier Tribunal judge to apply the  legislative
      framework to the evidence before him is an error of law  such  that  I
      set aside the decision to be remade.


  12. The nature and extent of fact finding which is necessary in order  for
      the decision in the appeal to be re-made is such that,  having  regard
      to the overriding objective, it is appropriate to remit  the  case  to
      the First-tier Tribunal.

          Conclusions:

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.

     I set aside the decision

     I remit the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal.


                                    Date 1st August 2017
