For the appellant:           None
For the respondent:          Mr N Bramble, a Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.    The appellant is male, a citizen of Bangladesh and  was  born  on  7th
      July, 1986.

2.          The appellant appeals against the determination  of  First  Tier
      Tribunal Judge Mailer, promulgated on 24th March, 2014 dismissing  his
      appeal against the decision of the respondent, taken on 17th  October,
      2013 to refuse to vary leave to remain in the United  Kingdom  and  to
      remove by way of directions  under  section  47  of  the  Immigration,
      Asylum and Nationality Act, 2006, as amended.

3.    Mr Bramble, the Home Office Presenting  Officer  advised  me  that  on
      behalf of the Secretary of  State  for  the  Home  Department  it  was
      accepted that the First Tier Tribunal Judge's determination  contained
      an error on a point of  law.   The  judge  failed  to  properly  apply
      Qureshi (Tier 4 - effect of variation - App C)  Pakistan  [2011]  UKUT
      00412 (IAC).

5.    The appellant produced a copy of  currency  converter  page  from  the
      internet dated 13th May, 2014 showing that the funds  he  held  of  Tk
      12,65,090.00 was in excess of ï¿½9500.  Mr Bramble indicated to me  that
      in the circumstances the appellant was entitled  to  have  his  appeal
      allowed.  He agreed to my producing a brief determination allowing the
      appellant's appeal.

6.    I am satisfied that Mr Bramble was entirely correct to agree that  the
      appellant  was  entitled  to  have  his  appeal  allowed  in  all  the
      circumstances.   I  indicated  that  I  would   prepare   this   short
      determination recording the agreement between the parties and allowing
      the respondent's appeal.

7.    Having carefully read the determination  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
      and the grounds of application, I am satisfied that the  determination
      of First Tier Tribunal Judge Mailer does contain an error on  a  point
      of law as identified in paragraph 3 above.  The making of the previous
      decision involved the making of an error on a point  of  law.   I  set
      aside the previous decision.  My  decision  is  that  the  Appellant's
      appeal is allowed.

Decision


      This appeal is allowed.
