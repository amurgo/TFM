Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1.   The appellants are Indian citizens born on 18 December 1981  and  25
      July 1981 respectively. They have each appealed with the permission of
      the First-tier Tribunal against decisions of Judge of  the  First-tier
      Tribunal C M Phillips, who dismissed their appeals  against  decisions
      of the respondent to refuse to vary  their  leave  to  remain  and  to
      remove  them  under  section  47  of  the  Immigration,   Asylum   and
      Nationality Act 2006.


   2.   The appellants both came to the UK in 2009 in  order  to  study  and
      they were both granted further leave undertake post-study  work.  They
      made in-time applications for further leave as Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)
      Migrants, having jointly formed a business teaching  computing  skills
      tailored to the needs of students. They each contributed approximately
      �25,000 towards the business. They provided bank letters  as  evidence
      of the �50,000 they needed to show they could invest in the  business.
      The appellants provided a letter from the Nationwide Building Society,
      dated 25 April 2013, confirming they held �16,780 in an account as  at
      that date. They also provided a  letter  from  Axis  Bank,  Bodhupatty
      Branch, dated 9 April 2013, confirming they  held  the  equivalent  of
      approximately �35,000 in an Indian Rupees account as at that date.


   3.   The respondent refused the applications by reference  to  paragraphs
      245DD(b) and Appendix A of the Immigration Rules, HC395,  because  the
      bank letters were not considered to show the appellants had access  to
      the �50,000 they needed to  secure  points  for  Attributes.  That  is
      because the letters had different dates and  therefore  did  not  show
      they had access to the funds on the same day. The appellants appealed.
      The grounds focused on issues of evidential flexibility and also  that
      removing the appellants would breach their rights under article  8  of
      the Human Rights Convention.


   4.    Judge Phillips considered the arguments and found  the  rules  were
      not met because the bank letters did not "provide  evidence  that  the
      appellants had �50,000 of funds available on any date" (paragraph 32).
      She found paragraph 245AA(c) applied so there was no  requirement  for
      the respondent to have requested further documents. She also dismissed
      the appeals on article 8 private life grounds.


   5.    The grounds seeking permission to appeal argue the judge  erred  in
      her application of the rules. Essentially, the rules did not  say  the
      letters had to be written on the same date and therefore the judge was
      creating rules. The grounds also argue that, where the  rules  do  not
      provide an answer, fairness demanded the respondent should have  given
      the appellants the opportunity to provide letters dated the same date.
      First-tier Tribunal Judge Grimmett granted permission to appeal on the
      first ground but did not prevent the appellants  arguing  their  other
      ground.

   6.   The respondent has filed a Rule 24 response opposing the appeal.


   7.   I heard submissions on the question of  whether  the  judge  made  a
      material error of law requiring her  decision  to  be  set  aside.  Mr
      Miah's point was essentially that the judge had invented a rule  which
      did not exist. Mr Avery argued the judge did not err. This was  not  a
      question  of  specified  documents.  The  fundamental  requirement  to
      provide evidence of �50,000 had not been met because the  two  letters
      did not tally.


   8.   I find the judge did make a material error of law for the  following
      reasons.


   9.   This case turns on a narrow point of interpretation. The rules  must
      be given their natural meaning. They state as follows:

         "245DD. Requirements for leave to remain

         To qualify for leave to remain as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant
         under this rule, an applicant must meet the requirements listed
         below. If the applicant meets these requirements, leave to remain
         will be granted. If the applicant does not meet these requirements,
         the application will be refused.

         Requirements:

         (a) ...

         (b) The applicant must have a minimum of 75 points under paragraphs
         35 to 53 of Appendix A."




         "Appendix A

         41. An applicant will only be considered to have access to funds
         if:

         (a) The specified documents in paragraph 41-SD are provided to show
         cash money to the amount required (this must not be in the form of
         assets); ..."




         "41-SD. The specified documents in Table 4 and paragraph 41 are as
         follows:

         (a) The specified documents to show evidence of the money available
         to invest are one or more of the following specified documents:

             (i) A letter from each financial institution holding the
             funds, to confirm the amount of money available to the
             applicant (or the entrepreneurial team if applying under the
             provisions in paragraph 52 of this Appendix). Each letter
             must:

                  (1) be an original document and not a copy,

                  (2) be on the institution's official headed paper,

                  (3) have been issued by an authorised official of that
                  institution,

                  (4) have been produced within the three months immediately
                  before the date of your application,

                  (5) confirm that the institution is regulated by the
                  appropriate body,

                  (6) state the applicant's name, and his team partner's
                  name if the applicant is applying under the provisions in
                  paragraph 52 of this Appendix,

                  (7) state the date of the document,

                  (8) confirm the amount of money available from the
                  applicant's own funds (if applicable) that are held in
                  that institution,

                  (9) confirm the amount of money provided to the applicant
                  from any third party (if applicable) that is held in that
                  institution,

                  (10) confirm the name of each third party and their
                  contact details, including their full address including
                  postal code, landline phone number and any email address,
                  and

                  (11) confirm that if the money is not in an institution
                  regulated by the FSA, the money can be transferred into
                  the UK;

             or

             (ii) For money held in the UK only, a recent personal bank or
             building society statement from each UK financial institution
             holding the funds, which confirms the amount of money
             available to the applicant (or the entrepreneurial team if
             applying under the provisions in paragraph 52 of this
             Appendix). The statements must satisfy the following
             requirements:

                  (1) The statements must be original documents and not
                  copies;
                  (2) The bank or building society holding the money must be
                  based in the UK and regulated by the Financial Services
                  Authority;
                  (3) The money must be in cash in the account, not
                  Individual Savings Accounts or assets such as stocks and
                  shares;
                  (4) The account must be in the applicant's own name only
                  (or both names for an entrepreneurial team), not in the
                  name of a business or third party;
                  (5) Each bank or building society statement must be on the
                  institution's official stationary and confirm the
                  applicant's name and, where relevant, the applicant's
                  entrepreneurial team partner's name, the account number,
                  the date of the statement, and the financial institution's
                  name and logo;
                  (6) The bank or building society statement must have been
                  issued by an authorised official of that institution and
                  produced within the three months immediately before the
                  date of the application; and
                  (7) If the statements are printouts of electronic
                  statements from an online account, they must either be
                  accompanied by a supporting letter from the bank, on
                  company headed paper, confirming the authenticity of the
                  statements, or bear the official stamp of the bank in
                  question on each page of the statement;

             or ..."

  10. As can be see, there is no requirement  in  the  rules  for  the  bank
      letters to have been issued on the same day. I can see that  any  such
      requirement could  potentially  create  substantial  difficulties  for
      applicants given  that  it  would  require  banks  to  cooperate  with
      requests to provide letters on a particular day. In any event,  if  it
      had been intended that the letters should be dated the same  day  then
      it would have been a simple matter to include this in  the  rules.  In
      the Points-Based System, there  are  detailed  requirements  regarding
      what documents must be produced and what they  must  show.  Additional
      requirements should not be written in by judges.


  11. I fully understand the point being made by the judge in this case  and
      echoed in his submissions by Mr Avery. Whilst there is  no  suggestion
      of such practice in this case, my interpretation could open the  rules
      up to abuse by enabling applicants who  do  not  have  access  to  the
      required level of funds to move money between accounts so as to create
      an artificial impression as to the total funds actually held. However,
      it is not correct to say the  appellants  have  not  shown  they  held
      �50,000. They have done so by reference to the exigencies of the rules
      as drafted.  The only requirement as  to  time  was  the  three  month
      window during which the letters must have been dated. This requirement
      was met by both letters.


  12. Having found the judge erred and set aside her decision, it is a short
      step to substituting a decision allowing these appeals. The only point
      by reference to which the appellants failed under the  rules  was  the
      one discussed. I have come to the opposite conclusion to that  of  the
      First-tier Tribunal as to the correct interpretation of the  rules.  I
      find the appellants did meet the requirement to show they  had  access
      to �50,000 by reference to the rules as set out above and I allow  the
      appeals.

DECISION

     The Judge of the First-tier Tribunal made a material error on a  point
    of law and her decision dismissing the appeals is set aside.


    The following decision is substituted:


    The appeals brought under the Immigration Rules are allowed.


    No anonymity direction has been made.




                               Signed                 Date 11 July 2014

                               Upper Tribunal



    Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

    In the light of my decision to re-make the decisions in the appeals  by
    allowing them, I have considered whether to make a fee award (rule  23A
    (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure)  Rules  2005
    and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
    2007).


    I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance Note:  Fee  Awards
    in Immigration Appeals (December 2011).


    I make a fee award of �140 in respect of each appellant.


    Reasons:      The appeals have been allowed.
