                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Background

 1. The Appellants challenge, with permission, the decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Heynes made following a hearing at  Manchester  on  30th
    June 2011.

 2. There is an unfortunate procedural history to this matter.

 3. The family arrived in  the  UK  on  10th  September  2010.   The  first
    Appellant was accompanying his wife who came to study at the university
    here.  He was granted limited leave to enter the UK until 31st  January
    2014 as a dependent partner, and  the  three  children  were  similarly
    granted leave to enter as dependants of their mother.

 4. On 21st March 2011  the  first  Appellant  made  an  application  under
    paragraph 327 of HC 395 for variation of his leave to enter  or  remain
    in the UK on the  grounds  that  it  would  be  contrary  to  the  UK's
    obligations under the UN Convention and Protocol Relating to the Status
    of Refugees for him to be removed from or required to leave the UK.

 5. His application was refused on 7th April 2011, and his wife  and  three
    children were similarly refused in line.

 6. The case came before Judge Heynes on 30th June 2011 who  dismissed  the
    appeal on asylum grounds and on human rights  grounds  but  found  that
    they were entitled to humanitarian protection.

 7. The Secretary of  State  sought  permission  to  appeal  against  Judge
    Heynes' decision in  relation  to  humanitarian  protection  which  was
    granted by Senior Immigration Judge  Eshun  on  29th  July  2011.   The
    Appellant also submitted an application for permission to appeal to the
    Upper Tribunal in relation to the asylum and human rights decision  but
    that application was overlooked.

 8. The matter came before me on 13th December 2012 when it came  to  light
    that there was an outstanding permission application from the Appellant
    yet  to  be  decided.   I  set  aside  the  decision  in  relation   to
    humanitarian protection and in remaking  the  decision,  dismissed  the
    appeal on that ground in a determination dated 13 December 2013.

 9. Because there was an outstanding application for permission  to  appeal
    against the asylum and human rights decision by the Appellants I made a
    separate decision, without a hearing, as a First-tier  Tribunal  Judge,
    to refuse permission to appeal.  Unfortunately that decision was  never
    served.

10. The matter then came before Upper Tribunal Judge Deans who, unaware  of
    the unserved decision, made a fresh decision on 2nd April  2013,  again
    refusing permission to appeal.

11. The Appellants renewed their application  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  and
    permission was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Peter Lane on 24th April
    2013. Upper Tribunal Judge Lane gave listing directions stating that  I
    should not have been sitting on the panel, having expressed a  view  by
    refusing permission to appeal against the decision.

12. Nevertheless, on 3rd June 2013 the matter came before  me  for  a  Case
    Management Review hearing when I made further directions.   The  matter
    was then listed before us on 4th October 2013 for a rolled up  hearing,
    first to decide whether there was an error of law and, if there was, to
    remake the decision.

Jurisdiction

13. At the commencement of the hearing we raised the issue of  jurisdiction
    with the parties.

14. Under Section 82(1) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002
    where an immigration decision is made in respect of a  person,  he  may
    appeal to the Tribunal.

15. Under Section 82(2) an immigration decision means, inter alia,

      a) Refusal to vary a person's leave to enter or remain in  the  UK  if
         the result if the refusals is that the person has no leave to enter
         or remain, or

      b) Variation of a person's leave to enter or remain in the UK if  when
         the variation takes effect the person has  no  leave  to  enter  or
         remain.

16. An appeal under Section 82 of the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum
    Act 2002 requires there to be an immigration decision as defined. Where
    no immigration decision has been  made, the First-tier Tribunal has  no
    jurisdiction to hear the appeal.  (Singh  (No  immigration  decision  -
    jurisdiction) [2013] UKUT 0440).

17. With respect to the principal  Appellant,  the  notice  of  immigration
    decision, variation of leave to enter or remain, reads as follows:

         "On 1st September 2010 you were granted limited leave to enter  the
         UK until 31st January 2014 as a dependant partner.

         You applied on 21st March 2011 under paragraph 327  of  HC  395  as
         amended (the Immigration Rules) for  variation  of  your  leave  to
         enter or remain in the UK on the grounds that it would be  contrary
         to the UK's  obligations  under  the  UN  Convention  and  Protocol
         relating to the Status of Refugees for you to be  removed  from  or
         required to leave the UK, but I have refused our application  under
         para 336. Your claim for asylum has been recorded as determined  on
         7th April 2011.

         I have considered whether you should be granted asylum in the UK in
         accordance with paragraph 334 but I am not satisfied that you  meet
         the criteria.

         I have also considered whether you should be  granted  humanitarian
         protection in the UK in accordance with paragraph 339C but I am not
         satisfied  you  meet  the  criteria  and  have  also  refused  your
         application  under  paragraph  339F.   Your  application  has  been
         recorded as determined on 7/04/11.

         Full reasons for this decision are provided in the attached letter.

         Furthermore I have decided that you no longer meet the requirements
         of the Immigration Rules under which  you  were  granted  leave  to
         enter the UK  and therefore I am giving you notice that your  leave
         will be varied under Section 3(3)(a) of the  Immigration  Act  1971
         such that there will be none  remaining.  The  leave  to  enter  or
         remain you had at the time you made this application is statutorily
         extended for the period when you can appeal under Section 82 of the
         Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002  or  until  an  appeal
         brought under that  Section  is  finally  determined  withdrawn  or
         abandoned."

18. The decision in respect of the dependants reads as follows:

         "On 1st September 2010 you were granted limited leave to enter  the
         UK until 31st January 2014 as a dependant.

         AEE applied on your behalf on 21st March 2011 under  paragraph  349
         of HC 395 as annexed (the Immigration Rules) for variation of  that
         leave because your are a dependant of AEE.

         Mr AEE has applied for a variation of leave to enter or  remain  on
         the grounds that it would be contrary to the UK's obligations under
         the UN Convention and Protocol relating to the  Status  of  Refuges
         for him to be removed from or required to leave  the  UK,  but  his
         application has been refused under  paragraph  336.   Consideration
         has also been given to whether he should  be  granted  humanitarian
         protection in the UK in accordance with paragraph 339C but I am not
         satisfied he meets the criteria and his application has  also  been
         refused under paragraph 339F.   Consequently  your  application  is
         refused."

19. Mr McVeetie was initially of the view  that  there  was  no  appealable
    decision in respect of any of the Appellants but, when  given  time  to
    seek instructions, he advised us that his position was that the  notice
    in relation to the first Appellant was  an  appealable  decision.  With
    respect to the dependents, Mr  McVittie  accepted  that  no  appealable
    decision was made under Section 82(2)  in  respect  of  the  dependants
    since there was no reference in the notice of  decision  to  curtailing
    their leave.

20. Mr McKindoe was reluctant to accept the lack of jurisdiction  but  made
    no cogent argment against it.

21. We conclude that there is no appealable  decision  in  respect  of  any
    Appellant, including the first Appellant, for the following reasons.

22. Mr Heynes recorded as follows:

         "The Respondent refused to grant asylum under paragraph 336  of  HC
         395 (as amended) for the reasons set out  in  the  refusal  letters
         dated 7th April 2011 and made a decision to curtail  the  leave  of
         and remove the Appellants from the  UK  by  way  of  directions  to
         Libya."

23. It seems that Judge Heynes was relying on the statement at PF1  of  the
    Respondent's bundle which states that:

         "On 7th April 2011 a decision was made to refuse  to  grant  asylum
         under paragraph 336 of HC 395 (as amended) and on 15th April,  2011
         a decision was made to vary leave to remain in the UK  so  that  no
         leave remained."

24. We could see no decision in the file made on 15th April 2011. The  only
    decision was dated 7th April 2011 and served on 15th April 2011.

25. We asked Mr McVeetie whether any further decision had been made on 15th
    April 2011 and he confirmed that there was none.

26. It is clear from the PF1 that the Secretary of State intended to make a
    further decision on 15th April 2011 to curtail  the  first  Appellant's
    leave but never did so. The wording of the notice of 7th April 2011  is
    that the Respondent gives notice that the leave will  be  varied,  i.e.
    curtailed, at a future date.  Indeed the Secretary of State appears  to
    believe that she had done so, by making reference in the PF1 to  a  non
    existent decision of 15th  April.

27. Moreover the fact that no reference to curtailment was made in  any  of
    the notices relating to the dependants supports the contention that  it
    was intended that a future appealable decision would be  made  both  in
    respect of them and the principal Appellant.

28. It is very regrettable that the jurisdictional point was not  taken  at
    an earlier stage, but we are satisfied that there  is  no  bar  to  the
    Upper Tribunal raising the  jurisdictional  point  of  its  own  motion
    (Rashid Anwar and Prosper Adjo [2010] EWCA Civ 1275).

29. We conclude that Judge Heynes  had  no  jurisdiction  to  consider  the
    dependants' appeals because no appealable immigration decision had been
    made.

30. It follows that no appealable immigration decision  was  made  in  this
    case and the position is that the  Appellants'  claims  remain  pending
    before the Secretary of State.

31. Accordingly, since there was no appealable decision, Judge  Heynes  had
    no jurisdiction to determine the appeal  and  his  decision  is  of  no
    effect.



Decision

32. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal was erroneous in purporting  to
    determine  an  appeal  when  there  was  no  jurisdiction  to  do   so.
    Accordingly the decision of the First-tier Tribunal must be set  aside.
    It is remade by dismissing the appeal for want of jurisdiction.
