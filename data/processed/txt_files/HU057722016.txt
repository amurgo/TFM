Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background

1.    The appellant relied on claimed earnings of �42,718.22 in  support  of
      Tier  1  application  in  2010.  He  relied  on  claimed  earnings  of
      �46,226.54 in support of Tier 1 application in 2013. It is  reasonable
      to infer that the respondent was satisfied with the  evidence  at  the
      time because both applications were granted.

2.    The appellant applied for Indefinite  Leave  to  Remain  (ILR)  on  16
      December 2015. On receipt of the application for  ILR  the  respondent
      made further enquiries with HMRC. The outcome of the enquiries  showed
      that the appellant had not declared "any  self  employed  or  employed
      earnings with them." On 16  December  2015  the  respondent  requested
      further  evidence  from  the  appellant,  including   an   SA302   tax
      calculation issued by HMRC. His legal  representative  requested  more
      time to respond. It is said that further  time  was  granted,  but  no
      further evidence was produced in response to the respondent's request

3.    The appellant appealed the respondent's  decision  dated  12  February
      2016 to refuse ILR with reference to the general  grounds  of  refusal
      under paragraphs 322(2), 322(5) and 322(9) of the immigration rules.

4.    First-tier Tribunal Judge Herlihy ("the judge") dismissed  the  appeal
      in a decision promulgated on  20  March  2017.  The  judge  took  into
      account the oral and documentary evidence and outlined  the  terms  of
      the  relevant  immigration  rules  [8-9].  The  judge   outlined   the
      allegation made by the respondent that the earnings he claimed in  the
      applications for leave to remain  made  in  2010  and  2013  were  not
      reflected in the HMRC records. The judge summarised:  "In  a  nutshell
      the claim is that the Appellant was claiming a higher level of  income
      in order to satisfy the Immigration Rules when he made his application
      for a Tier 1 General Migrant in 2010 and 2013 but when submitting  tax
      returns for the same period he had claimed that he was earning  less."
      [20].

5.    The judge went on to outline the correct legal test  relating  to  the
      burden and standard of proof. She confirmed that the burden  of  proof
      was on the respondent to show that paragraph  322(2)  applied  on  the
      balance of probabilities. She also had regard to the Court  of  Appeal
      decision in AA (Nigeria) [2010] EWCA Civ 773 [21].

6.    The judge considered the explanation put forward by the  appellant  in
      response to the allegation. She heard evidence from the appellant, but
      did not find him a reliable witness. The appellant's  explanation  was
      that his accountant made an error in submitting the  tax  returns  and
      had confused his details with another person. The judge did  not  find
      it plausible that the appellant did not check the tax  returns  before
      they were submitted [22]. There was no evidence to show exactly how or
      why the error occurred [23].

7.    The judge went on to give reasons to explain why she did not find  the
      appellant's explanation as to how he discovered  the  error  credible.
      There was no evidence to support his  claim  that  he  applied  for  a
      mortgage in September 2015.  The  judge  noted  a  discrepancy,  which
      undermined  the  appellant's  account.  The  appellant  said  that  he
      discovered the error when he obtained an SA302  tax  calculation  from
      HMRC during the mortgage application, yet was  unable  to  produce  an
      SA302 when requested by the respondent only a couple of  months  later
      [24]. The judge did not find it plausible that the  errors  were  only
      said to have occurred in the two years when he made an application for
      leave to remain  and  noted  the  lack  of  evidence  to  support  the
      appellant's claims [25].

8.    The judge observed that the evidence relied  upon  by  the  respondent
      from HMRC to support the allegation was missing.  However,  she  noted
      that the appellant did not dispute this aspect of the  allegation.  He
      accepted that his income was under reported. It was his evidence  that
      mistakes were made by his accountant and that he had now  taken  steps
      to rectify the errors [26]. The judge considered the most  recent  tax
      calculation for the year  2009/2010  issued  on  20  May  2016,  which
      indicated that the appellant declared income from employment and self-
      employment of �19,542. This was significantly lower than the amount he
      subsequently claimed  when  amending  his  tax  liability,  which  was
      �37,219 [27].

9.    The judge noted a  similar  pattern  of  large  discrepancies  in  the
      figures for the tax years 2010/2011 and 2012/2013 [28-29].  The  judge
      concluded that it was not credible that the appellant was  unaware  of
      such large discrepancies and noted that the pattern of under  reported
      income was repeated for several tax years.  The  judge  was  satisfied
      that the appellant used deception in  his  previous  applications  for
      leave to remain as a Tier 1  Migrant  by  falsely  claiming  that  his
      income was higher than it was [30]. For  the  same  reasons  she  also
      concluded  that  paragraph  322(5)  applied  because  the  appellant's
      character and conducted in using deception  in  previous  applications
      was such that it was undesirable to allow him  to  remain  in  the  UK
      [31].

10.    The  appellant  appeals  the  First-tier  Tribunal  decision  on  the
      following grounds:

      (i)   The judge erred  in  failing  to  consider  the  fact  that  the
           respondent  had  failed  to  produce  evidence  to  support  the
           allegation that he provided false information about  his  income
           in previous applications. The appellant  provided  the  relevant
           documents to support  the  applications  at  the  time  and  was
           awarded points for previous earnings.


      (ii)  The judge erred in failing to give due weight to the letter from
           the appellant's accountant who accepted that they made errors in
           the tax returns.


      (iii) The judge took issue with the fact that the appellant failed  to
           provide evidence to corroborate his earnings  for  the  relevant
           tax  years.  The  appellant  had  now  obtained  copies  of  the
           documents submitted in support of the applications for leave  to
           remain following a Subject Access Request. It was asserted  that
           the judge erred in law in determining the appeal  without  these
           documents.


      (iv)  The judge erred in finding that the high threshold required  for
           refusal under paragraph 322(5)  was  met  because  her  findings
           relating to paragraph 322(2) were flawed.


      (v)   The judge erred in failing to consider  whether  the  respondent
           exercised discretion properly in the circumstances of this case.



Legal framework

11.   Paragraph 322(2), (5)  and  (9)  of  the  immigration  rules  set  out
      grounds on which leave to remain should normally be refused.

           (2)   the making of false  representations  or  the  failure  to
                 disclose any material fact for  the  purpose  of  obtaining
                 leave to enter or a previous  variation  of  leave,  or  in
                 order to obtain documents from the Secretary of State or  a
                 third party required in  support  of  the  application  for
                 leave to enter or a previous variation of leave.


           ...


           (5)   the undesirability of permitting the person  concerned  to
                 remain in the United Kingdom in the light  of  his  conduct
                 (including convictions which do not fall  within  paragraph
                 322(1C), character or associations  or  the  fact  that  he
                 represents a threat to national security;


           ...


           (9)   failure by an applicant to  produce  within  a  reasonable
                 time information, documents or other evidence  required  by
                 the Secretary of State to establish  his  claim  to  remain
                 under these Rules;

12.   In AA v SSHD [2010] EWCA Civ 773 the Court of  Appeal  found  that  an
      element  of  dishonesty  was  required   to   show   that   a   "false
      representation" had been made for the purposes  of  mandatory  refusal
      under paragraphs 320(7A) or 322(1A) of the  immigration  rules  though
      the dishonesty need not have been carried out by  the  applicant.  The
      Secretary of State had  given  assurances  that  the  rules  were  not
      intended to catch those who had made innocent mistakes but to apply to
      those who had told lies in an application.

Decision and reasons

13.   The first ground has no merit.  The  judge  referred  to  the  correct
      legal test and noted the  fact  that  the  respondent  had  failed  to
      produce the evidence relating to her enquiries with HMRC. However, the
      judge was unarguably entitled to take into account the fact  that  the
      appellant did not  dispute  that  there  had  been  significant  under
      reporting of his income.

14.   The appellant accepted that the figures were wrong, produced a  letter
      from an accountant who claimed it was as a result of  his  error,  and
      produced other evidence to show that  he  took  steps  to  revise  the
      figures  and  was  making  additional  payments  to  HMRC.   In   such
      circumstances, it was not necessary for the respondent to produce  the
      underlying evidence from HMRC. The fact that  there  were  significant
      discrepancies in the income declared to HMRC and  the  claimed  income
      relied upon to support the previous applications for leave  to  remain
      gave rise to a strong inference that the appellant may  have  deceived
      the  respondent  by  inflating  his   claimed   income   in   previous
      applications for the purpose of gaining points under  the  immigration
      rules. The initial evidential burden of proof was discharged  and  the
      evidential burden then swung to the appellant to provide  an  innocent
      explanation in response.

15.   The judge rejected the appellant's explanation with  full  and  cogent
      reasons, which were open to her to make on  the  evidence.  The  judge
      clearly had regard to the letter from the accountants  when  she  made
      her decision because it was referred to at  [25].  The  evidence  that
      purported  to  come  from  the  accountant  repeated  the  appellant's
      explanation that he had confused the appellant's details with  another
      client. The judge considered this explanation at [22] but rejected  it
      with sustainable  reasons.  Not  only  was  it  implausible  that  the
      appellant would not check the tax returns before they were filed,  but
      it is equally implausible that the  accountant  would  make  the  same
      unlikely error on several occasions.

16.   I note that the appellant's explanation that the accountants  confused
      his details with another client is also belied  on  the  face  of  the
      evidence. The appellant produced the amended tax calculation  for  the
      year 2009/2010 as evidence to show that he  had  rectified  the  error
      made by his  accountant  (pg.22  AB).  The  original  figure  for  the
      appellant's employed income remained exactly the same (�18,172) in the
      revised figures, but the figure for  the  appellant's  claimed  income
      from self-employment increased from �1,370  to  a  revised  figure  of
      �19,047. If the original figures were mixed up with those  of  another
      client as the appellant and the  letter  purporting  to  be  from  his
      accountant claim,  it  seems  highly  unlikely  that  the  figure  for
      employed income would remain the same. The very low figure  given  for
      self-employed income in the original tax return supports  the  judge's
      conclusion that the appellant sought  to  deceive  the  respondent  by
      inflating the amount he claimed to earn from self-employed income  for
      the purpose of the application for leave to remain in 2010.

17.   Although the judge did not make  specific  findings  to  outline  what
      weight she gave to the letter purporting to be from an accountant,  it
      is quite clear from her findings that she rejected the credibility  of
      the explanation given by the appellant, which  was  the  same  as  the
      explanation given in the accountant's letter. Any error is  immaterial
      because the letter would not have made any difference to  the  outcome
      of the appeal given the judge's findings.

18.   In so far as semantic submissions were made about  whether  the  judge
      considered the type of income relied upon by the appellant properly it
      is not material to the core issue raised in the appeal. The  appellant
      accepted that the tax returns involved significant under reporting  of
      his claimed income. It hardly mattered whether it was employed,  self-
      employed or involved dividend income.  The  significant  discrepancies
      were sufficient to discharge the  respondent's  evidential  burden  of
      proof. The judge turned to consider whether the appellant provided  an
      innocent explanation in response  and  gave  sustainable  reasons  for
      rejecting the credibility of his account. It  is  understandable  that
      the appellant disagrees with the decision, but it is not arguable that
      the judge's findings were outside a range of reasonable  responses  to
      the evidence.

19.   It is difficult to see how the judge could have erred  in  failing  to
      take into account evidence that was not before her and has  only  been
      produced after the hearing. It was not  disputed  that  the  appellant
      produced evidence of his claimed  income  with  the  applications  for
      leave to remain in 2010 and 2013. The respondent  was  satisfied  with
      the evidence at the time and granted leave  to  remain.  It  was  only
      after enquiries were made with the HMRC following the application  for
      ILR that the  respondent  casts  doubt  on  the  reliability  of  that
      evidence and  asserted  that  the  significant  discrepancies  in  the
      appellant's claimed levels of income led to  the  conclusion  that  he
      used deception in those previous applications. The clear inference  is
      that the evidence produced in support of those applications was likely
      to be unreliable. The respondent did not have to prove this  with  any
      certainty, only to the balance of probabilities.

20.    In  any  event,  the  documents  attached  to  the  application   for
      permission to appeal do not take  the  issue  any  further.  The  only
      documents relating to the application made in 2010 are a partial  copy
      of the application form and the  decision  letter  granting  leave  to
      remain. No copies of the documents relied upon  to  support  the  2010
      application are provided. The judge's findings in relation to the 2010
      application are unaffected.

21.   The rest of the documents relate  to  the  application  for  leave  to
      remain made in 2013, which include copies of supporting documents such
      as employed and dividend income from his directorship of AB Management
      IT Services Ltd. Unaudited financial statements were prepared  by  the
      same  accountant,  whose  credibility  must  be  in  doubt  given  the
      implausible explanation provided about the claimed errors. A number of
      credits from AB Management IT Services Ltd  are  recorded  in  a  bank
      statement in the appellant's name, but even if the appellant now seeks
      to rely on this evidence, no schedule of the income has been prepared.



22.   The amount of previous gross earnings claimed by the appellant in  the
      application made in 2013 was �46,226.54 with a combination  of  salary
      and dividend payments from the company. His updated  evidence  showing
      the adjustments he made with HMRC was before the  First-tier  Tribunal
      (pg.30 AB). The HMRC calculation printed on 09 June 2016  showed  that
      the appellant previously did not declare any income for the  tax  year
      2012/2013. The revised figures declared �10,104 from  all  employments
      and dividend income of �30,121, giving  a  total  declared  income  of
      �40,225. The fact that HMRC had no  record  of  income  tax  that  was
      purportedly paid as part of the appellant's employed income undermines
      the reliability of the payslips produced in support  of  the  original
      application for leave to remain, which purported to deduct income tax.



23.   The Tribunal will normally not consider new  evidence  which  was  not
      before the First-tier Tribunal  in  deciding  whether  the  First-tier
      Tribunal decision involved the making of an  error  of  law.  Although
      there  was  evidence  before  the  respondent  at  the  date  of   the
      application in 2013 to indicate that the appellant might have received
      some income from AB Management IT Services Ltd, the fact that  no  tax
      was declared in relation  to  that  income  does  cast  doubt  on  the
      reliability of the evidence that  was  submitted  in  support  of  the
      application. Even if the source of the income relied upon in the  2013
      were to be verified,  it  would  not  undermine  the  judge's  overall
      finding  that  paragraph  322(2)  applied  in  relation  to  the  2010
      application. It was still open to the judge  to  find  that  paragraph
      322(5) applied if the appellant failed to declare any income  for  the
      tax year 2012/2013. Nothing in the further evidence produced after the
      First-tier Tribunal  hearing  shows  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal's
      findings were, as a matter of fact,  wrong  to  the  extent  that  the
      decision should be set aside.

24.   For the reasons given above I find that the judge did not err  in  her
      consideration of the  issues  relevant  to  paragraph  322(2)  of  the
      immigration rules. She considered the  relevant  legal  framework  and
      gave detailed and sustainable reasons to explain her findings.  Having
      concluded that the appellant used deception in  previous  applications
      for leave to remain in 2010 and 2013 it was unarguably open to her  to
      find that the appellant's conduct was  sufficiently  serious  to  also
      justify refusal under paragraph 322(5) of the immigration rules.

25.   In relation to the last ground of appeal, an application for leave  to
      remain will "normally  be  refused"  if  the  conditions  outlined  in
      paragraphs 322(2) or 322(5) apply. The paragraphs do not  provide  for
      mandatory refusal, but will normally apply if there is  evidence  that
      an applicant made false representations in a previous application.  It
      is not clear whether this issue was argued before the  judge,  and  if
      so, what grounds were put forward to say that discretion  should  have
      been exercised. Apart from the general assertion that the appellant is
      likely to be disadvantaged by the refusal because he  will  be  denied
      the opportunity for settlement, and can no longer  apply  for  further
      leave to remain in the same category, no good reasons have been  given
      as to why discretion should have been exercised  to  depart  from  the
      normal course of action, which was to refuse the application.  In  the
      circumstances it is difficult to see how the judge could have erred if
      there was no basis upon which  the  respondent  should  have  exercise
      discretion.

26.   For completeness, I  note  that  the  application  for  ILR  was  also
      refused under paragraph 322(9). No evidence appeared to be produced to
      undermine this reason for refusal and no ground  of  appeal  has  been
      raised in relation to the issue. The appeal would have been  dismissed
      on this ground alone.
