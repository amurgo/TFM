                                   Between

                 Secretary of State for the Home Department
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                             Ebuka Cletus Enumah
                        [No anonymity direction made]

                                                                    Claimant

Representation:

For the claimant: Mr J Dhanji, instructed by UK Immigration Lawyers
For the respondent:    Ms C Johnstone, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The claimant, Ebuka Cletus Enumah, date of birth 12.4.83, is a  citizen
    of Nigeria.

 2. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the  determination
    of First-tier Tribunal Judge  Dickinson,  who  allowed  the  claimant's
    appeal against the decision of the respondent, dated 5.11.13, to refuse
    his application made on 14.10.13 for leave to remain in  the  UK  as  a
    Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant under the Points Based System  (PBS)  and
    to remove him from the UK by way of directions under section 47 of  the
    Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act  2006.   The  Judge  heard  the
    appeal on 25.2.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge  Osborne  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    15.4.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 11.6.14. as an appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Preliminary Issue

 5. At the outset of the hearing, Mr Dhanji explained that  the  claimant's
    representatives had submitted a  late  application  for  permission  to
    cross-appeal the  decision  of  Judge  Dickinson  in  relation  to  the
    Immigration Rules, together with an application for permission to apply
    out of time. By Rule 24  that  is  an  application  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal and is to be determined on the papers by a First-tier Tribunal
    Judge.

 6. It was explained that the applications were made late  because  of  the
    recent decision of Mr Ockelton, Vice President and Upper Tribunal Judge
    Grubb in the case of Shebl (Entrepreneur: proof  of  contracts)  [2014]
    00216 (IAC), in which the panel held that the requirement to prove  the
    existence of "contracts" in  paragraph  41-SD  of  Appendix  A  to  the
    Immigration Rules does not itself require the contracts in question  to
    be contained in documents. There is, however, a need for such contracts
    tob e evidenced in documentary form.

 7. This may be highly relevant  to  the  decision  under  the  Immigration
    Rules, as Judge Dickinson found that an invoice could not be  described
    as a contract and whilst the judge was satisfied that the claimant  may
    have had an oral agreement, he had to provide an original document or a
    signed copy.

 8. Mr Dhanji asserted that the applications had been served on the  First-
    tier Tribunal by fax on 3.6.14. However,  a  check  of  the  Tribunal's
    computer system revealed no such applications  have  been  recorded  as
    lodged. Even if it had been lodged, it had not been determined. In  the
    circumstances, I could not entertain the cross-appeal application.

 9. The Secretary of State's appeal against the decision of Judge Dickinson
    is based on the finding that the decision was disproportionate  to  the
    legitimate aim to be achieved when considering the  claimant's  private
    life rights.

10. I need not rehearse  the  grounds  of  application  for  permission  to
    appeal, but in summary it is  asserted  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge materially erred in his approach  to  article  8  and  failed  to
    provide adequate reasons why the appellant's circumstances  are  either
    compelling or exceptional. In fact there was no reference at all to  MF
    (Nigeria) or Gulshan, both of which were promulgated before the  First-
    tier Tribunal appeal hearing.

11. Briefly, recent authority is to the effect that the  Immigration  Rules
    are a complete code and there is no need  to  look  outside  the  Rules
    unless there are arguably good grounds for consideration that there are
    compelling circumstances not adequately recognised in the Rules,  which
    render the decision of the Secretary of State  unjustifiably  harsh.  I
    set out below a summary of some of the recent case law.

12. In MF (Nigeria) v SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ 1192, the Court of  Appeal  held
    that in relation to deportation cases the 'new' Immigration Rules are a
    complete code but involve the application of  a  proportionality  test.
    Whether that is done within the new rules or outside the new  rules  as
    part of the article 8 general law was described as a sterile  question,
    as either way the result should be the same. MF (Nigeria) was  followed
    in Kabia (MF: para 398 - "exceptional circumstances") 2013  UKUT  00569
    (IAC).

13. In Gulshan (Article 8 - new Rules - correct approach) [2013] UKUT 00640
    (IAC) has set out, inter  alia,  that  on  the  current  state  of  the
    authorities:

         (a)     the  maintenance  requirements  of  E-LTRP.3.1-3.2   stand,
             although Blake J in R (on the application of MM)  v  Secretary
             of State for the Home Department [2013] EWHC 1900 (Admin) said
             that they could constitute an unjustified and disproportionate
             interference with the ability of spouses to live together;  he
             suggested that an appropriate figure may  be  around  �13,400,
             and highlighted the position of  young  people  and  low  wage
             earners caught by the higher figure in the rules;

         (b)    after applying the requirements of the Rules, only if  there
             may be arguably good grounds  for  granting  leave  to  remain
             outside them is it necessary for Article 8 purposes to  go  on
             to consider whether there  are  compelling  circumstances  not
             sufficiently recognised under them: R (on the application  of)
             Nagre v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2013] EWHC
             720 (Admin);

         (c)    the term "insurmountable obstacles" in  provisions  such  as
             Section  EX.1  are  not  obstacles  which  are  impossible  to
             surmount: MF (Article 8 - new rules) Nigeria [2012] UKUT 00393
             (IAC); Izuazu (Article 8 - new rules) [2013] UKUT 00045 (IAC);
             they concern the practical possibilities of relocation. In the
             absence of such insurmountable obstacles, it is  necessary  to
             show other non-standard and particular features  demonstrating
             that removal will be unjustifiably harsh: Nagre.

14. It is illustrative that in Gulshan the Upper Tribunal  considered  that
    it was not unduly harsh for a husband who originated from Pakistan  but
    was now a British national, to return to Pakistan with his wife who was
    seeking leave to remain as his spouse. The panel acknowledged that  the
    couple would suffer some hardship, as he had been in the UK since 2002,
    he had worked here and was receiving a pension, and housing benefit and
    other state benefits,  some  of  which  could  not  be  transferred  to
    Pakistan.

15. More recently, in Shahzad (Art 8: legitimate  aim)  [2014]  UKUT  00085
    (IAC), the Upper Tribunal held:

         (i)  Failure on the part of the Secretary of State to  identify  in
             her decision any legitimate aim under Article 8(2) of the ECHR
             does not prevent a court or tribunal from seeking to do so  on
             the basis of the materials before it.

          (ii)   "Maintenance of effective immigration control"  whilst  not
             as such a legitimate aim under Article 8(2) of  the  ECHR  can
             normally be assumed to be either an aspect of  "prevention  of
             disorder or crime" or an aspect of "economic well-being of the
             country" or both.

           (iii)    "[P]revention  of  disorder  or  crime"  is  normally  a
             legitimate aim both in expulsion cases where  there  has  been
             criminal conduct on the part of the claimant and in  expulsion
             cases where there have only been breaches of immigration law.

          (iv)    MF (Nigeria) [2013]  EWCA  Civ  1192  held  that  the  new
             immigration rules regarding deportation of a foreign  criminal
             are  a  complete  code.  This  was  because  of  the   express
             requirement in  them  at  paragraph  398  to  have  regard  to
             exceptional circumstances and other factors.

          (v)   It follows from this that any other rule which has a similar
             provision will also constitute a complete code;

          (vi)    Where an area of the rules does not have such  an  express
             mechanism, the approach in R (Nagre) v Secretary of State  for
             the Home Department [2013]  EWHC  720  (Admin)  ([29]-[31]  in
             particular) and Gulshan (Article  8  -  new  Rules  -  correct
             approach) [2013] UKUT 640 (IAC) should be followed: i.e. after
             applying the requirements of the rules, only if there  may  be
             arguably good grounds for granting  leave  to  remain  outside
             them is it necessary for  Article  8  purposes  to  go  on  to
             consider  whether  there  are  compelling  circumstances   not
             sufficiently recognised under them.

16. It is clear that the determination does not address any of these issues
    and does not in  any  way  justify  the  exceptional  consideration  of
    private and family life under article 8 ECHR  outside  the  Immigration
    Rules by reference to compelling circumstances. The article 8  exercise
    was conducted merely by reference to the Razgar steps, from �17 of  the
    determination onwards. I find that the failure to justify consideration
    of private and family life outside the Immigration Rules was  an  error
    of law.

17. I further note that at �25 the judge relies on his assessment that  the
    claimant fell marginally short of achieving  the  relevant  points  and
    thus meeting the requirements of  the  Immigration  Rules.  In  Miah  &
    Others [2012] EWCA Civ 261, the Court of Appeal confirmed that there is
    no near miss principle applicable to  the  Immigration  Rules  and  the
    matters set out at �25 were not relevant. For that reason also there is
    error of law in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

18. Mr Dhanji did not resist the Secretary of State's appeal.

19. For the reasons set out above I find that there was such error  of  law
    in the making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal that it should
    be set aside.

20. When a decision of the First-tier Tribunal has been set aside,  section
    12(2) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 requires either
    that the case is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal  with  directions,
    or it must be remade by the Upper Tribunal. The scheme of the Tribunals
    Court and Enforcement Act 2007 does not assign the function of  primary
    fact finding to the Upper Tribunal. Where the facts are  unclear  on  a
    crucial issue at the heart of an appeal, as  they  are  in  this  case,
    effectively there has not been a valid determination of  those  issues.
    The errors of the First-tier Tribunal Judge vitiates all other findings
    of fact and the conclusions from those facts so that there has not been
    a valid determination of the issues in the appeal.

21. In all the circumstances, at the invitation and request of both parties
    to relist this appeal for a fresh hearing in the First-tier Tribunal, I
    do so on the basis that this is a case which falls squarely within  the
    Senior President's Practice Statement at paragraph 7.2. The  effect  of
    the error has been to deprive the appellant of a fair hearing and  that
    the nature or extent of any judicial fact finding  which  is  necessary
    for the decision in the appeal to  be  re-made  is  such  that,  having
    regard to the overriding objective in rule 2 to deal with cases  fairly
    and justly, including with the avoidance of delay, I find  that  it  is
    appropriate  to  remit  this  appeal  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to
    determine the appeal afresh. It will then be possible for the appellant
    to seek to rely on  Shebl  in  relation  to  the  contractual  evidence
    required under the Immigration Rules.

Conclusions:

22. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did involve the making  of  an  error  on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

     I set aside the decision.

     I remit the decision in the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal.

Consequential Directions

23. The appeal is to be heard afresh in the  First-tier  Tribunal  with  no
    findings preserved.

24. Either party may submit further evidence in respect of  the  issues  in
    the appeal, not later than 7 days before the adjourned hearing date.





Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The outcome of the appeal remains to be determined  in  the  First-
tier Tribunal.
