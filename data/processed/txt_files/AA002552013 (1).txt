For the Respondent:    Mr M Blundell, Counsel instructed by Theva
Solicitors



                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS

 1. The appellant in these proceedings is the Secretary of State.  However,
    for convenience I refer to the parties as they were before  the  First-
    tier Tribunal.

 2. Thus, the appellant is a citizen of Sri Lanka born on 22 June 1989.  He
    originally arrived in the UK on 24 September 2009 and then returned  to
    Sri Lanka on 5 December 2011. He came back to  the  UK  on  26  October
    2012. Following an unsuccessful claim for asylum, a decision  was  made
    on 18 December 2012 to remove him. His  appeal  against  that  decision
    came before First-tier Tribunal Judge Clayton on 25 July 2013,  whereby
    she allowed the appeal on asylum and human rights  grounds.  She  heard
    evidence  from  the  appellant  and  from  a  witness  called  on   the
    appellant's behalf.  That evidence and the submissions of both  parties
    are set out in the determination.

 3. The basis of the appellant's claim, in brief summary, is that he had  a
    fianc�e and on an occasion when there was a sports day at  the  college
    that his fianc�e taught  at,  the  President's  son,  Namal  Rajapaksa,
    attended. He apparently took a liking to the  appellant's  fianc�e  and
    invited her to his hotel which invitation she declined.   This  led  to
    her being abducted or kidnapped and in  due  course  this  led  to  the
    appellant himself being abducted, detained and  ill-treated,  after  he
    had made a report to the police and gone to court in  relation  to  his
    missing fianc�e.

 4. In considering the appellant's account  the  First-tier  Judge  made  a
    number of findings.  They appear from [56] of the  determination.   She
    started by saying that:

         "Having considered all the evidence before me with the most anxious
         scrutiny, I accept the Presenting Officer's submission that much of
         his story is not credible and there  are  many  discrepancies.   In
         particular, the whole account of his fianc�e's alleged kidnap  does
         not have the ring of truth."

 5. From then on she made a number of other  assessments  of  the  evidence
    concluding that in most material respects his account for one reason or
    another was not plausible. Those findings appear from [57].

 6. In the last sentence of [57] Judge Clayton said that although she found
    that it would physically be possible for the President's son to  travel
    from where he was, in order to be at the sports day, she found that  to
    be most unlikely.  This related to evidence which is referred to in the
    refusal letter whereby it was established that the President's son  was
    in fact at a place other than the sports day on the  day  in  question,
    although it was contended on behalf of the appellant that he would have
    been able to travel from the other event to the  sports  day  in  time.
    There was background evidence in relation  to  his  regular  use  of  a
    helicopter.  In any event, as I say, the First-tier  Judge  found  that
    scenario was most unlikely.

 7. Having gone on to consider various different aspects of the appellant's
    account which she found inherently incredible, crucially, it  seems  to
    me, at [63] in relation to  the  appellant's  immigration  history  she
    referred to his having come to the UK on 24 September 2009 as a Tier  4
    Student, his application to extend his leave and then his  having  left
    the UK for Sri Lanka during which time  the  alleged  events  occurred.
    The crucial part of that paragraph is this:

         "I find a more reasonable explanation is that he came  to  the  UK,
         failed to renew his visa but having been here for some  time  found
         life in the UK to be more congenial than that in Sri Lanka.  I find
         the likely explanation is that he  simply  decided  to  return  and
         claimed asylum so that he might stay here."

 8. That it seems to me is an almost unequivocal finding that his claim for
    asylum is not based on a true account of events.  I  am  reinforced  in
    that view by what the judge said at [56] and  [57],  to  which  I  have
    already referred.

 9. At [64] the judge considered, albeit briefly, the medical evidence.   I
    have considered for myself the medical report  from  Mr  Andres  Martin
    which refers to scars on the appellant's back and limbs.   In  relation
    to the medical evidence, the judge said that the  medical  report  does
    not rule out that the scars were self-inflicted  or  inflicted  at  the
    behest of the appellant.  She said that although the appellant  claimed
    to have attended the A & E department very shortly after  returning  to
    the UK there is no evidence of this. She went on to state that  somehow
    "his medical records appear to have gone missing.  Dr Martin was unable
    to state in the medical report how long prior to  his  examination  the
    scars had been inflicted".

10. At [65], giving further consideration  to  the  medical  evidence,  she
    concluded  that  they  are  very  significant  and  that   they   would
    undoubtedly arouse suspicion if detected upon return.   Pausing  there,
    the submission on behalf of the respondent is that there is  no  reason
    to suppose that the appellant would attract suspicion on return in  the
    light of the judge's hitherto adverse credibility  findings.  Again  at
    [65] it was concluded that the appellant has  such  extensive  scarring
    that following GJ & Others (post-civil war:  returnees)  Sri  Lanka  CG
    [2013] UKUT 00319 (IAC), if the appellant came to the attention of  the
    authorities on  return  there  would  be  a  reasonable  likelihood  of
    detention and torture.  The judge went on to reiterate that  she  found
    several aspects of his  claim  to  be  implausible  but  to  the  lower
    standard accepted that he was "detained and tortured  as  claimed  with
    the  resulting  extensive  scarring  to  his  body".   Following   that
    conclusion, the appeal was allowed on asylum and Article 3 grounds.

11.  Mr  Melvin  submitted  that  the  credibility  findings  are  at  best
    inconsistent and, at worst, either perverse or irrational.

12. Mr  Blundell  suggested  that  the  credibility  findings  were  merely
    signposts to the ultimate assessment of credibility which the judge was
    entitled to make, namely to the effect that his account  was  credible,
    in particular having regard to the medical evidence.

13. I am satisfied however, that the findings made by the First-tier  Judge
    are irreconcilable.  I have already referred  to  the  aspects  of  the
    determination in its earlier stages of findings,  which  indicate  that
    she did not accept the credibility of the appellant's  account.   Those
    findings are many and varied and I am not satisfied that the conclusion
    at [65] to the effect that the appellant had established  that  he  was
    detained and tortured as  claimed  is  at  all  consistent  with  those
    earlier findings.

14. I am not satisfied that satisfactory reasons were given for  concluding
    that the appellant would arouse suspicion if detected upon return,  and
    I agree with the submissions made on behalf of the  respondent  to  the
    effect that the conclusion at [65] that he was  detained  and  tortured
    "as claimed" is  not  a  conclusion  that  follows  from  the  previous
    findings.  In those circumstances, I am satisfied that  the  First-tier
    judge erred in law.

15. I do not need to go on to consider the separate argument in relation to
    GJ.  There was a concession by the  Secretary  of  State  that  if  the
    appellant's account was to be believed then he would have established a
    risk of persecution or Article 3  ill-treatment  on  return.   It  does
    however, seem to me that the judge ought to  have  engaged  more  fully
    with the current country guidance decision in GJ.  Nevertheless,  there
    is a sufficient basis for the reasons I have  already  given,  to  find
    that there is an error of law such as to require the decision to be set
    aside.

16. I heard submissions from both parties as to the appropriate  course  of
    action in the event that I came to that view. Both parties agreed  that
    if I was to find an error of law  in  the  credibility  findings  which
    required the decision to be set aside, it would be appropriate for  the
    appeal to be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal. I  do  consider  that
    that is the appropriate  course.  Accordingly,  having  regard  to  the
    Practice Statement at paragraph 7.2, given the nature and extent of the
    credibility findings that will need to be re-made,  it  is  appropriate
    for this matter to be remitted  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  re-
    hearing de novo.


                               DIRECTIONS

    1.   The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for a hearing de
          novo before a judge other than First-tier judge Clayton.


    2.   No credibility findings are preserved.


    3.   A Tamil interpreter is required.


    4.   Further directions as to listing of the appeal may be left to  the
          discretion of the First-tier Tribunal.
