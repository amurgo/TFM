                                                                 Respondents


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr N Bramble, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondents:   Ms F Allen, Counsel


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant in this appeal is the Secretary of  State  for  the  Home
    Department. The respondents are citizens of Pakistan born on 4th  April
    1982 and 20th May 1986 respectively.  They are husband and wife.   They
    have two children both born in the United Kingdom who are also citizens
    of Pakistan. However for the sake of convenience, I shall  continue  to
    refer to the parties as they were before the First-tier Tribunal.

2.   Since the appeals of the second appellant rests or falls with  that  of
    the first appellant,  I  shall  deal  with  the  appeal  of  the  first
    appellant and refer to him as "the appellant".   The  appellant  appeal
    against the decision of the respondent dated 29th  January  2018  under
    paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules.

3.   Judge P S Aujla of the First-tier  Tribunal  allowed  both  appellants'
    appeals in a decision promulgated on 1st April 2019.

4.   The Secretary of State appealed against  the  decision  and  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Parkes granted permission to appeal  on  7th  June  2019
    stating that it is arguable that the judge erred in failing to consider
    two pieces of evidence when allowing the appellant's appeal.  The first
    was the fact that the appellant was employed in  accounts  and  it  was
    highly unlikely that he would fail to identify a discrepancy of ï¿½36,000
    and would have taken steps earlier to rectify the mistake.  The  timing
    of his taking steps to rectify this mistake suggested it was  done  for
    his application for indefinite  leave  to  remain  and  not  simply  to
    correct the error.  The judge with "some hesitation" granted permission
    to appeal to the Secretary of State.

5.   I heard submissions from both Mr Bramble and Ms  Allen  as  to  whether
    there is an error of law in the decision.

My Findings as to the Error of Law

6.   Upon the reading of the decision it is clear that the judge  took  into
    account all the evidence.  The judge refused the application under  the
    general grounds of refusal under paragraph 322(5) of  the  Rules.  This
    was due to the discrepancies in the appellant's declared income to HMRC
    for  tax  purposes  and  the   UKVI.    Paragraph   322(5)   says   the
    undesirability of permitting a person concerned to remain in the United
    Kingdom in light of his conduct (including conditions which do not fall
    within paragraph 322(1C), character or associations or the  facts  that
    he represents a threat to national security).  Therefore the judge  had
    to  consider  the  appellant's  conduct  in  relation  to  the  earning
    discrepancy.

7.   The Home Office Presenting Officer before the First-tier  Tribunal  did
    not make any allegation that the appellant had used  deception  but  at
    the same time said that the discrepancy was not an innocent mistake.  I
    have considered the case of Balajigari, in the Court of Appeal,  [2019]
    EWCA Civ 673 at paragraph 35 where the Court of Appeal states that

         "As to the first two limbs Mr Biggs' position was that an  earnings
         discrepancy  case  could  constitute   sufficiently   reprehensible
         conduct for the purposes of paragraph 322(5) if  but  only  if  the
         discrepancy was the  result  of  dishonesty  on  the  part  of  the
         applicant."

 8. The Home Office Presenting Officer at the hearing before the First-tier
    Tribunal made no allegation of dishonesty against  the  appellant.  The
    burden of proof is on the respondent to demonstrate that the  appellant
    was dishonest in relation to the discrepancy in his earnings. Therefore
    if the respondent had made no allegation  of  dishonesty,  he  had  not
    satisfied his burden of proof which initially was upon him. I refer  to
    the case of R (on the application of Khan) of the  Secretary  of  State
    for the Home Department (dishonesty,  tax  return,  paragraph  322  (5)
    [2018] UKUT 00384  (IAC)  when  assessing  whether  the  appellant  was
    dishonest in relations to his  dealings  UKVI  or  HMRC.  Therefore  an
    allegation of dishonesty must form  the  basis  of  any  refusal  under
    paragraph 322(5).

 9. In the circumstances, the First-tier Tribunal Judge did not  fall  into
    material error as alleged by the respondent.  I therefore find that the
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal's decision is safe and I uphold it.
