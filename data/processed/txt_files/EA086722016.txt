Upon reading the grant of permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal and
upon reading the respondent's email of 9 April 2018


                      ERROR OF LAW FINDING AND REASONS


     1. The appellant appeals with permission against a decision of  First-
        tier Tribunal Judge Aziz  who,  on  28  July  2017,  dismissed  the
        appellant's appeal for want of jurisdiction.
     2. The appellant has appealed  against  the  respondent's  refusal  to
        grant a Residence Card as confirmation of a right of  residence  in
        the United Kingdom as an extended family member of an EEA national.





Error of law


     3. The Judge found the First-tier  Tribunal  had  no  jurisdiction  in
        light of the decision in the case of Sala[ 2016] UKUT 00411.
     4. Although not before the Judge at the time, the Court of  Appeal  in
        the case of Khan [2017] EWCA Civ 1755 found that Sala  was  wrongly
        decided. Although this decision post-dates the determination  under
        challenge it relates to a situation that existed at  the  date  the
        First-tier Tribunal found as it did, which  is  in  relation  to  a
        legal position which has been found to be always unsustainable.
     5. The respondent in the email of 9 April 2018 notes that in light  of
        Khan and the decision of the Supreme Court in SM  (Algeria)  [2018]
        UKSC 9, the  permission  application  is  not  opposed  and  it  is
        requested the Upper Tribunal deals with the matter  under  Rule  39
        and remits the matter back to the First-tier Tribunal  without  the
        need for parties to attend the Initial hearing listed for 10  April
        2018.
     6. According, I find the First-tier Tribunal erred in law in a  manner
        material to the decision they  had  no  jurisdiction  to  hear  the
        appeal.
     7. The Upper Tribunal  sets  aside  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
        Tribunal, vacates the Initial hearing listed for 10 April  2018  as
        the  same  is  no  longer  required,  and  substitutes  a  decision
        remitting the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal to be heard on  its
        merits. The appellant has not yet had the opportunity of an  appeal
        at which proper findings of fact are made by that Tribunal.

Decision

     8. The First-tier Tribunal Judge materially erred in law. I set  aside
        the decision of the original Judge. I remit the appeal to the First-
        tier Tribunal sitting at Hatton Cross to be heard  by  a  Judge  of
        that Tribunal on its merits.


   Anonymity.


     9. The First-tier Tribunal did not make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
        45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
        2005.


        I make no such order pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal  Procedure
         (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.
