Representation:
For the Appellant:     Miss N Braganza, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr P Duffy, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant states he is a citizen of  Iraq  born  on  25th  February
    1995.  The Secretary of State doubts the Appellant's nationality.   The
    Appellant originally applied for  asylum  on  12th  March  2010  having
    arrived in the United Kingdom as an illegal entrant in  February  2010.
    It was noted that the Appellant had been fingerprinted in France on two
    separate occasions providing  two  different  names  on  each  occasion
    initially on 16th December 2009 and then again on 5th January 2010.

 2. On 22nd April 2010 the Appellant's asylum application  was  refused  by
    the Secretary of State but he was granted discretionary leave to remain
    in the United Kingdom until  24th  August  2012  when  he  reached  17ï¿½
    exclusively in accordance  with  the  Secretary  of  State's  published
    policy on handling of asylum applications  from  unaccompanied  asylum-
    seeking children.  The Appellant  had  lodged  an  appeal  against  the
    decision on 7th May 2010 which was dismissed by Immigration Judge  Khan
    in a determination dated 14th  June  2010.   On  16th  August  2012  an
    application for further leave to remain was received.  On 28th  January
    2015 a decision was made to refuse to grant further leave and to remove
    the Appellant from the  United  Kingdom  by  way  of  directions  under
    Section 10 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999.

 3. The basis of the Appellant's claim was that he feared  if  returned  to
    Iraq he would face mistreatment due to his  imputed  political  opinion
    namely that his  father  was  accused  of  being  a  terrorist  by  the
    government and was killed when  the  police  stormed  his  house.   The
    Appellant appealed the Notice of Refusal of the Secretary of State  and
    the appeal came before Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Cheales sitting
    at Birmingham on 23rd April 2015.  In a decision and reasons dated 13th
    May 2015 the Appellant's appeal was dismissed on all counts (the First-
    tier Tribunal Judge's wording)  which  I  take  to  mean  that  it  was
    dismissed on asylum and human rights grounds and that the Appellant was
    found not to be in need of humanitarian protection.

 4. On 22nd May 2015 Grounds of Appeal were lodged to the  Upper  Tribunal.
    On 8th June 2015 First-tier Tribunal Judge Lambert  refused  permission
    to appeal.  Renewed grounds were  lodged  on  23rd  June  2015.   Those
    renewed grounds were considered by Upper Tribunal  Judge  Goldstein  on
    3rd August 2015.  Judge Goldstein noted that this was an appeal where a
    central issue centred upon whether the Appellant hailed from  Mosul  or
    was from Erbil as a finding in  that  regard  would  in  light  of  the
    background material impact upon whether or not the Appellant  would  be
    at real risk on return to Iraq.  Judge Goldstein indicated that he  was
    just persuaded that the ground raised an arguable issue as  to  whether
    in light of the evidence before the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  in  its
    totality the judge had given adequate reasons for concluding  that  the
    Appellant hailed from Erbil and  as  to  whether  the  judge  was  thus
    entitled in law to reach that conclusion.

 5. On 1st September 2015 the Secretary of State responded to  the  Grounds
    of Appeal under Rule 24 stating that the judge  had  made  findings  of
    fact on the basis of the evidence and provided adequately clear reasons
    at paragraphs 18 to 20 for finding the Appellant was from Erbil.

 6. It is on that basis that this  matter  comes  before  me  to  determine
    whether or not there is a material error of law in the decision of  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge.  The Appellant  appears  by  his  instructed
    Counsel Ms Braganza.  The Secretary of State appears by her Home Office
    Presenting Officer Mr Duffy.





Submissions/Discussions

 7. Ms Braganza advises that the central issue to this appeal is a  finding
    as from where the Appellant comes from.  She takes me to  paragraph  17
    of Judge Cheales' determination where she recites that it was  accepted
    by both parties that if the judge finds  that  the  Appellant  is  from
    Mosul he could not be returned there as this is a contested area.  That
    remains the agreed stance of both parties.  Ms  Braganza  submits  that
    the judge had the Home Office bundle,  the  Appellant's  bundle  and  a
    skeleton argument and was effectively spoon fed as to what evidence was
    available and was invited to find that the Appellant came  from  Mosul.
    She submits the materiality of the error  is  due  to  the  information
    provided by the Appellant as shown within the documentation.  By way of
    example she submits that the Appellant was able to provide  details  of
    the name of the mosque in Mosul and of schools in the area but none  of
    these findings are to be found within the determination.  She takes  me
    to extensive paragraphs to be found within the Home Office bundle.  She
    points out therein that it is recorded in the Appellant's  initial  age
    assessment document that he states he left Mosul in Iraq two days after
    his mother died in February 2010, that he has had no  formal  education
    (paragraph A19), and refers me  to  specific  extracts  from  his  2010
    interview where he states  clearly  therein  that  his  last  permanent
    address was in Mosul and that when he set out to come to the UK he left
    from Mosul.  She emphasises that throughout the interviews provided  by
    the Appellant he has referred to himself as  coming  from  Mosul.   She
    submits that there are answers within the Appellant's interview  record
    that the Appellant is unlikely to know unless he came from Mosul.   She
    submits that the Appellant's evidence ties in with his stance  that  he
    comes from Mosul and that there is clear factual evidence that he would
    not know had he come from Erbil rather than Mosul.  She points out that
    the judge was provided  with  a  skeleton  argument  and  that  in  her
    decision the judge has failed to take into account any of these factors
    and that there is a requirement at least to deal with the evidence  and
    consequently the failure to do so constitutes a material error  of  law
    and that the outcome  to  this  appeal  would  she  submits  have  been
    different had the judge addressed the evidence.

 8. Mr Duffy points out that the  issues  in  this  appeal  were  initially
    predicated as far back as 2010 and that the Appellant  was  well  aware
    that there would be no workable claim if he states he came  from  Erbil
    and consequently it would be to his advantage to  state  that  he  came
    from Mosul.  He submits the judge was open to make  the  findings  that
    she did and that the arguments put forward may  well  be  construed  as
    disagreement or indeed even a perverse challenge and  he  asked  me  to
    find that there is no error of law.  He points out that the  judge  had
    looked at the expert's report and found that  the  Appellant  was  from
    Erbil and he submits that mosques and  schools  can  be  found  on  the
    internet.  He submits that the evidence provided is neither strong  one
    way or the other as to where the Appellant originates from but that his
    language is.  He submits that the submissions amount to a  disagreement
    with the decision of the judge and asked me to find that  there  is  no
    material error of law.



The Law

 9.  Areas  of  legislative  interpretation,  failure  to  follow   binding
    authority or to distinguish it with adequate reasons, ignoring material
    considerations  by  taking  into  account  immaterial   considerations,
    reaching irrational conclusions  on  fact  or  evaluation  or  to  give
    legally inadequate reasons for the decision and procedural  unfairness,
    constitute errors of law.

10. It is not an arguable error of law for an Immigration Judge to give too
    little weight or too much weight to a factor, unless  irrationality  is
    alleged.  Nor is it an error of law for an Immigration Judge to fail to
    deal with every  factual  issue  of  argument.   Disagreement  with  an
    Immigration Judge's factual conclusion, his appraisal of  the  evidence
    or assessment of credibility, or his evaluation of risk does  not  give
    rise to an error of law.  Unless an Immigration Judge's  assessment  of
    proportionality is arguable as being  completely  wrong,  there  is  no
    error of law, nor is it an error of law for an Immigration Judge not to
    have regard to evidence of events arising after his decision or for him
    to have taken  no  account  of  evidence  which  was  not  before  him.
    Rationality is a very high threshold and a conclusion is not irrational
    just because some alternative explanation has been rejected or  can  be
    said to be possible.  Nor is it necessary to  consider  every  possible
    alternative  inference  consistent   with   truthfulness   because   an
    Immigration Judge concludes that the story is untrue.  If  a  point  of
    evidence of significance has been ignored or misunderstood, that  is  a
    failure to take into account a material consideration.

Findings on Error of Law

11. I start by reminding myself that it is the role of the  Upper  Tribunal
    solely to determine at this instance as to whether or not  there  is  a
    material error of law in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge.
     I am not re-trying the issues.  This appeal  has  one  straightforward
    and central theme namely did the judge err in law in finding  that  the
    Appellant came from Erbil and not from Mosul.  I emphasise within  this
    determination that I am making no findings one way or  the  other.   It
    would undoubtedly be open to the Secretary of State to  maintain  quite
    reasonably a stance that all that the submissions being made amount  to
    a mere disagreement with the judge's findings had  the  judge  examined
    the evidence fully and had the judge made appropriate findings  on  all
    that evidence.   Ms  Braganza  adduces  a  very  thorough  analysis  of
    evidence which she submits support the Appellant's contention  that  he
    came from Mosul and not  Erbil.   She  further  acknowledges  that  the
    Appellant's parents were from Erbil originally and that all the factors
    which support the Appellant's contentions and which were brought to the
    judge's attention appear to have been ignored by the judge when writing
    her determination.  Had the  judge  recited  those  factors  and  given
    reasons as to why she did not agree with  them  then  she  acknowledges
    that she would be in some difficulty  in  maintaining  her  submissions
    that the judge has erred in law.

12. The fact however remains that the  judge  is  silent  on  many  crucial
    factors.  Whether they ultimately are ones that are believed by a judge
    is not a matter today for this Tribunal.  What I am satisfied  is  that
    they are factors  that  are  material  and  that  they  have  not  been
    addressed.  In such circumstances the correct decision is to find  that
    there is a material error of law in  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge and to set aside that decision and to remit  the  appeal
    back to the First-tier Tribunal for rehearing.

Decision and Directions

13. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains a  material  error  of
    law and is set aside.  The matter is remitted back  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal for rehearing before any judge other  than  Immigration  Judge
    Cheales.  It is noted that the Appellant has  moved  addresses  and  in
    such circumstances the following directions will apply:

      1) The matter be remitted for rehearing at Hatton Cross on  the  first
         available date 42 days hence with an ELH of three hours.

      2) It is recorded that a finding on whether the Appellant  comes  from
         Mosul or Erbil and consequently could be returned to his home  town
         will be determinative of this appeal.

      3) That there be leave to either party to file and serve an up-to-date
         bundle of evidence and  any  skeleton  arguments  upon  which  they
         intend to rely at least fourteen days prior to the restored hearing
         date.

      4) That the Appellant do attend for the purpose of cross-examination.

      5) That the restored hearing be given an estimated length  of  hearing
         of three hours.

      6) That a Kurdish (Sorani) interpreter do attend the restored hearing.

No anonymity direction is made.
