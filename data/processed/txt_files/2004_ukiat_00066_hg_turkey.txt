                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


   1. The appellant is a citizen of Turkey who has been given permission  to
      appeal  the  determination  of  an  Adjudicator,  Mr Richard  McKee,
      dismissing on both Refugee Convention and  human  rights  grounds  his
      appeal against the respondent's decision to refuse to grant asylum and
      leave to enter the United Kingdom.

   2. Ms Y Ruban of Counsel  instructed  by  Kaj  Mordi  &  Co,  solicitors,
      appeared for the appellant.  Mr W Saville, a  Home  Office  Presenting
      Officer, represented the respondent.

   3. The appellant entered the United Kingdom illegally on 23 May 2003.  He
      claimed asylum on arrival.  The notice containing the decision against
      which he appeals is dated 13 May  2003.   The  Adjudicator  heard  the
      appeal on 3 July 2003 and permission to appeal was granted on 5 August
      2003.

   4. The appellant claimed to fear  persecution  from  the  authorities  in
      Turkey because of his involvement with HADEP  and  alleged  sympathies
      with the PKK.  He said that he was arrested, detained, brutally beaten
      and tortured by the police on two occasions, for three  days  in  1999
      and four to five days in 2001.  The respondent  did  not  believe  the
      appellant, nor did the Adjudicator.  He had not made out the facts  on
      which he sought to rely.

   5. The Adjudicator determined the appeal at the preliminary  hearing  and
      in the absence  of  the  appellant  or  any  representatives  for  the
      parties.  The notice  of  hearing  sent  to  the  appellant  and  both
      representatives on 13 June 2003 said that the first hearing  would  be
      on Wednesday 2 July 2003 but, if the appeal was not determined on that
      day, there would be a full hearing on 31 July 2003.  The appellant  or
      his representatives were instructed to complete and return the form of
      reply.  The notice gives the warning  "failure  to  attend  the  first
      hearing without a satisfactory explanation or to return the  reply  to
      directions  will  lead  to  a  DETERMINATION  OF  THE  APPEAL  IN  THE
      APPELLANT'S ABSENCE AT THE FIRST HEARING."

   6. In the grounds of appeal the appellant  accepts  that  the  notice  of
      hearing was sent to him and his former solicitors on 14 June 2003.  At
      the hearing before us Counsel submitted that  the  appellant  had  not
      received the notice of  hearing.   However,  when  we  asked  for  the
      evidence to support  the  submission,  she  conceded  that  there  was
      nothing to this effect in the grounds of  appeal  or  the  appellant's
      subsequent witness statement.  She modified her submission to say that
      the position was not clear.  We do not agree.  In the absence  of  any
      clear allegation to this effect, and bearing in mind that  the  notice
      of hearing sent to the appellant has not been returned, we  find  that
      the appellant did receive it.

   7. The grounds erroneously submit that the appeal was determined  without
      consideration of the merits through no fault of the appellant.

   8. We can find no merit in the submissions that  the  Adjudicator  should
      have adopted a different course  of  action,  did  not  make  adequate
      enquiries and should have contacted the  appellant.   The  Adjudicator
      caused enquiries to be made, which are set out in the third  paragraph
      of the determination.  Whilst he cannot be criticised for doing  this,
      he was under no obligation to do so. An Adjudicator does not  need  to
      pursue the parties or their representatives to find out what they  are
      doing where he or she is satisfied that proper  notice  of  the  date,
      time and place of the hearing has been given.

   9. The grounds go on to submit that the appellant was told by his  former
      solicitors that he need not attend the first hearing and was not  told
      until 4 July 2003 that he should look  for  another  solicitor.   They
      wrote to him on 9 July 2003 saying that they would  be  closing  their
      file.  It is submitted that the former solicitors failed to  give  the
      appellant adequate proper or timeous advice.

  10. The Vice President who granted permission to appeal said,

           "The claimant should file a statement  forthwith  verifying  his
           address and the matters stated in the grounds of appeal.  Absent
           such a statement a successful outcome or remittal should not  be
           assumed as the Adjudicator's approach appears correct."


  11. The appellant's bundle submitted for the hearing before us contains  a
      witness statement from him dated 28 January 2004.  It is common ground
      that this says nothing about the circumstances in which he  claims  to
      have been let down by his former solicitors and does not  address  the
      matters which the  Vice  President  specifically  directed  should  be
      addressed.  Ms Ruban sought to  argue  that  in  paragraph  1  of  his
      witness statement the appellant adopted his grounds of appeal  to  the
      Tribunal.  This is not correct.  The only reference  to  a  notice  or
      grounds of appeal is to the notice of appeal to the  Adjudicator,  not
      the appeal to the Tribunal.  In any event the appellant does not state
      that these are true.

  12. The appellant has not, as would, in the absence of good reasons to the
      contrary, be good  practice  where  allegations  are  made  about  the
      actions  or   failures   of   previous   representatives.    The   new
      representatives should have communicated the grounds of appeal and any
      supporting documents to the former representatives and asked  them  to
      confirm, deny or comment.  This should have been  done  and  the  full
      text of the letter and reply provided for the Tribunal and  the  other
      party. His claims might have gained some support if his new solicitors
      had put in a statement saying  when  they  were  first  contacted  and
      instructed.  They have not done so.

  13. The appellant and those now acting for him have had ample warning  and
      opportunity to provide details of the matters relied on in the grounds
      of appeal and evidence in support.  They have failed to do so and have
      not provided any explanation.

  14. The Adjudicator did not treat the appeal as abandoned or determine  it
      without considering the  merits.   The  determination  is  brief,  but
      appropriately so.  The Adjudicator reached conclusions which were open
      to him on the evidence.

  15. This determination is being reported in relation to paragraphs  8  and
      12; what enquiries an  Adjudicator  should  make  where  there  is  no
      attendance by or for the Claimant and good practice where  allegations
      are made against former representatives.


  16. We dismiss this appeal.
