                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms N Willoks-Briscoe, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr D Ball (counsel), instructed by Hersi & Co,
solicitors.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    I have considered whether any parties require  the  protection  of  an
anonymity direction. No anonymity direction was made previously  in  respect
of this Appellant. Having considered all the circumstances  and  evidence  I
do not consider it necessary to make an anonymity direction.

2.    The Secretary of State for the Home Department brings this appeal  but
in order to avoid confusion the parties are referred to as they were in  the
First-tier Tribunal. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State  against  a
decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Lingam, promulgated on 11 March  2015,
which allowed the Appellant's appeal under both the  immigration  rules  and
article 8 ECHR.

Background

3.    The appellant is a Somalian national, born on 4 May 1987.

4.     On  16  December  2013,  the  respondent  refused   the   appellant's
application for entry clearance as a dependent relative of the sponsor  (her
son) present and settled in the UK.

The Judge's Decision

5.    The  appellant  appealed  to  the  First  Tier  Tribunal.  First  Tier
Tribunal Judge Lingam ("the Judge") allowed  the  appellant's  appeal  under
both the Immigration Rules and on Article 8 ECHR grounds.

6.    Grounds of appeal were lodged and on 13 May 2015, First Tier  Tribunal
Judge Lambert gave permission to appeal, stating inter alia:

         "2 Ground 1 argues that in finding relevant a  medical  certificate
         dated almost a year after the date of decision, the judge failed to
         have regard to Section 85A(2), 2002 Act, which remains in force  in
         relation to this type of appeal. This is arguable. Ground 2 depends
         on it and is also arguable.

         3  Ground 3 claims inadequate  reasoning  under  Article  8  as  to
         family  between  the  appellant  and  sponsor  given  the  latter's
         departure from Somalia in 2002. This may or  may  not  be  arguable
         given the content of paragraphs 31 and 32 of the decision,  but  is
         not excluded from the grant of permission."

7.    In a decision promulgated on 25 September  2015,  the  Upper  Tribunal
set aside the First Tier Tribunal decision finding that a material error  of
law had been made, stating inter alia

         "A fair reading of the Judge's decision indicates that the  Judge's
         decision was influenced by the appellant's  medical  conditions  in
         December 2014. Section 85A(2) of the 2002 Act  prevents  the  Judge
         from taking account of the appellant's circumstances after the date
         of decision. The decision should have been made on the basis of the
         appellant's circumstances in December 2013, not December 2014. "

The Hearing

8.    Mr Ball counsel for the appellant told me that he had some  difficulty
because his instructing agents had not seen a copy  of  the  Upper  Tribunal
decision  promulgated  25  September  2015  (finding  that  the   First-tier
Tribunal's decision was tainted by material error of  law  &  setting  aside
that decision). He was provided with a copy of the decision  promulgated  on
25 September 2015 by  the  Home  Office  presenting  officer.  After  taking
instructions from the sponsor he moved to adjourn the hearing  so  that  the
appellant and sponsor could have further time to prepare.

9.    Ms Willocks-Briscoe opposed the application to adjourn  on  the  basis
that the sponsor was present, ready and able  to  evidence  of  the  central
issues which were matters within his knowledge.

10.   I refused the application to adjourn. The  case  file  indicates  that
the  decision  promulgated  on  25  September  2015  was  intimated  to  the
appellant's solicitors. The  appellant's  solicitors  were  separately  sent
notice of today's hearing on 27 October  2015.  The  appellant's  solicitors
knew there would be a hearing today, but made no enquiry  about  the  nature
of today's hearing. It is surprising that they  chose  to  instruct  counsel
without being able to tell counsel  the  purpose  of  today's  hearing.  The
sponsor was present and was ready to give evidence; the  sponsor  wanted  to
proceed today rather than wait for an adjourned hearing date.

11.   I heard evidence from the appellant's son, Abdi Mohamed Muse. He  gave
evidence with the assistance of a court interpreter. He  participated  fully
in the hearing. I remain satisfied that  there  were  no  difficulties  with
linguistic interpretation or comprehension. He was taken  to  the  terms  of
his witness statement, dated 7 January 2015, which he adopted  as  the  main
part of his evidence in chief before he answered a number  of  supplementary
questions from counsel for the appellant. He was then cross examined  before
questions were asked in brief re-examination. I then heard parties'  agents'
submissions.

12.   I considered the documentary evidence which had been lodged  addresses
the most important issues.  This consists of:

         (i)      The Home Office PF1 bundle;

         (ii)     The appellant's bundle which contains the items listed  on
             the index to the bundle, together  with  background  materials
             relating to care & treatment of the elderly in Ethiopia

Findings of Fact

13.   The appellant is the mother of Abdi Mohamed Muse ("the  sponsor").  In
2002 the sponsor moved to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia to  avoid  the  violence  in
Somalia.  The  appellant  divorced  from  the  sponsor's  father  when   the
appellant was only two years old. For most of  the  sponsor's  childhood  he
lived alone with his mother. His mother remarried  and  had  three  children
with the appellant's stepfather.

14.   When the sponsor left Somalia in 2002  the  appellant  remained  there
with the appellant's stepfather and his three par- siblings. In  April  2009
the sponsor came to the UK and claimed asylum. He was  granted  humanitarian
protection on 12 June 2012.

15.   In 2009 the appellant fled from Mogadishu with  her  husband  and  her
three younger children. They made their way to a  refugee  camp  where  they
lived until 2011. One-day that refugee camp was attacked by  Al-Shabab.  The
appellant was not in the refugee camp at the time of the attack because  she
had gone to visit a local market. When she returned there was  no  trace  of
her husband and her three younger children. She  has  not  seen  them  since
that day. The appellant joined a small group of other  Somali  refugees  and
crossed the border into Ethiopia. From Ethiopia the appellant contacted  the
sponsor; the sponsor has sent money  for  the  appellant's  maintenance  and
accommodation since then.

16.   The appellant lives alone in a one  roomed  property  rented  from  an
Ethiopian landlord. In March 2013  the  sponsor  visited  the  appellant  in
Ethiopia. He hired a carer for his mother. That carer  has  been  dismissed.
The appellant only speaks Somali, which is not  the  language  of  Ethiopia.
The sponsor telephones his mother at least three times a week.

17.   In February and March 2014 the  appellant  visited  a  hospital  Addis
Ababa were on examination she was found to be  suffering  from  hypertension
and "mental problem". On 14 December  2014  the  appellant  was  seen  at  a
hospital in Addis Ababa and found to be  suffering  from  PTSD,  depression,
rheumatoid arthritis and back and joint pains.

18.   On 6 November 2013 an on-line application for leave to  enter  the  UK
to join the sponsor as a parent dependent  relative  was  submitted  to  the
respondent.  The  application  form  was  completed  online  by   solicitors
appointed by the appellant. In answer to question 1.7  it  was  stated  that
the appellant suffers from "dementia/blood pressure". In answer to  question
1.8 it was declared that the appellant is able to  care  for  herself  on  a
daily basis.

19.   The sponsor lives alone in a one-bedroom rented  flat.  The  sponsor's
flat has a living room which is converted into a bedroom for the  appellant.
The sponsor works as a cleaner and typically earns between �1400  and  �1500
a month. His income after his rental is deducted  exceeds  the  amount  that
the appellant and sponsor would be entitled to if they claimed DWP  benefits
in the UK.

The Immigration Rules

20.   On 20 November 2015 the following direction  was  served  on  parties'
representatives.

         "In this case the Respondent's decision was  made  on  16  December
         2013.  The  appellant's  application  was  submitted  as  an  adult
         dependent relative under appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.  The
         respondent  refused  the  application  under  paragraph   EC-DR1.1.
         Submissions in this appeal focused principally on E-ECDR2.4.

         It is common ground that the sponsor has been granted  humanitarian
         protection. Parties are directed  to  provide  written  submissions
         focusing on  the  impact  and  effect  of  paragraph  319V  of  the
         Immigration Rules on the facts and  circumstances  of  this  appeal
         within 14 days.

         If either party requires to make an application  for  extension  of
         time, such application must be made in writing within  14  days  of
         today's date."

21.   Counsel for the appellant responded  to  that  direction  25  November
2015 & candidly conceded that paragraph 319V of the rules  only  applies  to
applications made before 9 July 2012. The application in this case was  made
on 6 November 2013 so that I cannot consider  the  provisions  of  paragraph
319V. I am invited to take account of the fact that if this application  had
been made prior to 9 July 2012 it would have succeeded under paragraph  319V
of the Immigration Rules. What I cannot ignore is that this application  was
made on 6 November 2013, 16 months after  the  changes  to  the  Immigration
Rules which  prevent  the  appellant  from  benefiting  from  the  terms  of
paragraph 319V of the Immigration Rules.

22.   The respondent refused the appellant's application  after  considering
paragraph EC-DR.1.1(d)  of  Appendix  FM  of  the  Immigration  Rules.   The
relevant provisions of Appendix FM are E-ECDR 2.4 and 2.5 which  provide  as
follows:

         "2.4     The  applicant  must  as  a  result  of  age,  illness  or
         disability require long-term  personal  care  to  perform  everyday
         tasks.

         2.5      The applicant must be unable, even with the practical  and
         financial help of the sponsor, to obtain the required level of care
         in the country where they are living, because

             (a) it is not available and there is no person in that country
             who could reasonably provide it; or

             (b) it is not affordable."

23.   The respondent's decision was made on 16 December  2013  and  sent  to
the appellant on 23 December 2013. I must look at the facts of this case  as
they were in December 2013. There is evidence  that  by  December  2014  the
appellant suffered from depression, rheumatoid arthritis and back and  joint
pain. There is evidence that 12  months  after  the  date  of  decision  the
appellant suffered from PTSD. The only reliable evidence of the  appellant's
state of health  in  December  2013  is  contained  in  appendix  1  to  the
application form, which was completed by solicitors. In answer  to  question
1.8 it is confirmed on the appellant's behalf that she is able to take  care
of herself on a daily basis, and is able to pursue the  ordinary  activities
of daily living independently.

24.   The reliable evidence indicates that the  appellant  cannot  meet  the
requirements of paragraph EC-DR.1.1(d) of Appendix  FM  of  the  Immigration
Rules.

25.   The "outpatients medical certificate" produced  by  the  appellant  is
dated 12 months after the date of decision and cannot be considered  because
of the operation of section 85A(2) of the 2002 Act. In any  event,  appendix
FM-SE (paragraphs 33 to 37) sets out the  evidential  requirements  for  the
applications of this nature. The  "outpatients  medical  certificate"  falls
short of those requirements. The burden of proof rests with  the  appellant.
The appellant manifestly fails to discharge the burden of proving  that  she
fulfils the requirements of the Immigration Rules.

Article 8 ECHR.

26.   In R (on the application of Esther Ebun Oludoyi & Ors) v Secretary  of
State for the Home Department (Article 8  -  MM  (Lebanon)  and  Nagre)  IJR
[2014] UKUT 00539 (IAC) it was held that there is nothing  in  R  (Nagre)  v
SSHD [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin), Gulshan (Article  8  -  new  Rules  -  correct
approach) Pakistan [2013] UKUT 640 (IAC) or Shahzad (Art 8: legitimate  aim)
[2014] UKUT 00085 (IAC) that  suggests  that  a  threshold  test  was  being
suggested as opposed to making it clear that there was a  need  to  look  at
the evidence to see if  there  was  anything  which  has  not  already  been
adequately considered in the context of  the  Immigration  Rules  and  which
could lead to a successful Article 8 claim. These authorities  must  not  be
read as seeking to qualify or fetter the assessment of Article  8.  This  is
consistent with para 128 of R (MM & Others) v  SSHD  [2014]  EWCA  Civ  985,
that there is no utility in  imposing  a  further  intermediate  test  as  a
preliminary to a consideration of an Article 8  claim  beyond  the  relevant
criterion-based Rule. As is held in R (Ganesabalan) v SSHD [2014] EWHC  2712
(Admin), there is no prior threshold which dictates whether the exercise  of
discretion should be considered; rather the nature  of  the  assessment  and
the  reasoning  which   are   called   for   are   informed   by   threshold
considerations.

27.   In SS (Congo) and Others [2015] EWCA Civ  387  Lord  Justice  Richards
said at paragraph 33 "In our judgment, even though a test of  exceptionality
does not apply in every case falling within the scope of Appendix FM, it  is
accurate to say that the general  position  outside  the  sorts  of  special
contexts referred to above is that compelling circumstances  would  need  to
be identified to support a claim for grant of LTR outside the new  Rules  in
Appendix FM. In our view, that is a formulation which is not as strict as  a
test of exceptionality or a requirement of  "very  compelling  reasons"  (as
referred to in MF (Nigeria) in  the  context  of  the  Rules  applicable  to
foreign criminals), but  which  gives  appropriate  weight  to  the  focused
consideration  of  public  interest  factors  as  finds  expression  in  the
Secretary of State's formulation of the new Rules in Appendix  FM.  It  also
reflects the formulation in Nagre at para. [29], which has been  tested  and
has survived scrutiny in this court: see, e.g.,  Haleemudeen  at  [44],  per
Beatson LJ".

28.   Section 117 of the 2002 Act is a factor to be taken  into  account  in
determining proportionality.  I  appreciate  that  as  the  public  interest
provisions are now contained in primary legislation they  override  existing
case law, Section 117A(2) requires me to have regard to  the  considerations
listed in Sections 117B and 117C.  I am conscious of my  statutory  duty  to
take these factors into account when coming to my conclusions.   I  am  also
aware that Section 117A(3) imposes upon  me  the  duty  of  carrying  out  a
balancing exercise. In so doing I remind myself of  the  guidance  contained
within Razgar.

29.   The appellant's article 8 ECHR argument proceeds  on  the  basis  that
family life exists between the appellant  and  her  sponsoring  son.  It  is
argued that the factors which create  family  life  within  the  meaning  of
article 8 ECHR are that the appellant fled violence in Mogadishu only to  be
separated from her husband and  younger  children  by  an  attack  on  their
refugee camp; that  she  and  the  sponsor  re-establish  contact  when  the
appellant made her way  to  Ethiopia;  the  appellant's  advancing  age  and
increasing frailty; and the financial dependency of  the  appellant  or  her
sponsoring son, who provides the money necessary to  pay  for  accommodation
and health care.

30.   In Kugathas v SSHD [2003] INLR 170 the Court of Appeal said  that,  in
order to establish family life, it is necessary to  show  that  there  is  a
real committed or effective  support  or  relationship  between  the  family
members and the normal emotional ties between a  mother  and  an  adult  son
would not, without more, be enough. In Etti-Adegbola v SSHD [2009] EWCA  Civ
1319 the Court of Appeal concentrated on the last  part  of  that  test  and
confirmed that the Tribunal had applied the right test  in  finding  that  a
family's behavior was "no way exceptional or beyond the norm".

31.   The case of  AAO  v  Entry  Clearance  Officer  [2011]  EWCA  Civ  840
involved an elderly Somali mother living in Kenya supported  by  a  daughter
in the UK who she had not seen for 12 years. The Court of Appeal  held  that
family life would not normally exist  between  parents  and  adult  children
within the meaning of Article 8  in  the  absence  of  further  elements  of
dependency which went beyond normal emotional ties: Although the money  sent
to the Claimant raised an element of dependency, it did not take the  matter
very far.  The provision of such  money  could  be  as  much  an  insulation
against family life as evidence of it. There  was  nothing  to  prevent  the
daughter continuing with the provision of money and  to  that  extent  there
was no interference with family life. Of more importance  was  the  evidence
which led to the conclusion that  there  was  no  strong  bond  between  the
Claimant and her daughter.  For 12 years,  there  had  been  little  contact
between them other than the provision of the  money  and  monthly  telephone
calls.  As for the Claimant's situation in Nairobi, she  had  accommodation,
albeit in straitened circumstances, and  was  looked  after  by  neighbours.
Under all the circumstances there could be no complaint  about  the  judges'
conclusion that the family life between the Claimant and  her  daughter  was
too weak as to render the ECO's decision an interference with or failure  to
show respect for the Claimant's Article 8 rights (paras 35 and 42 - 46).

32.   In Vikas and Manesh Singh [2015]  EWCA  Civ  630  when  there  was  no
evidence of anything beyond the normal  bonds  of  affection  between  adult
children and their parents, possibly apart from some  financial  support  of
the family in India, that support could not lead  to  a  finding  of  family
life.

33.   No reliable evidence was led before the First-tier for the Upper  Tier
tribunal to indicate that the facts and circumstances of this case  are  any
different from the determinative factors  in  each  of  the  cases  narrated
above. On the facts as I find them  to  be,  the  relationship  between  the
appellant and sponsor extends to nothing more  than  normal  emotional  ties
between a mother and her adult son. For 10 years between  2002  &  2012  the
was little, if any, contact between the appellant and  sponsor.  Since  2012
there has been regular contact. The sponsor has  visited  the  appellant  in
Ethiopia.

34.   The appellant fails to discharge the burden  of  proving  that  family
life within the  meaning  of  article  8  ECHR  exists.  On  the  facts  and
circumstances of this case, if I had found that family life exists, I  would
then have to find that the  respondent's  decision  does  not  amount  to  a
disproportionate interference to the right to respect for that  family  life
because  the  respondent's  decision  does  not  prevent   the   established
financial support from  continuing,  nor  does  it  interrupt  the  frequent
telephone contact between the appellant and sponsor, nor does  the  decision
prevent the sponsor from visiting his mother again.

Decision

35.   The appeal is dismissed under the Immigration Rules.

36.   The Appeal is dismissed on Article 8 ECHR grounds.
