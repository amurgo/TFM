For the Respondent:    Mr S Kandola, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

     1. In a decision promulgated on 10 August 2017 Judge of the First-tier
        Tribunal  Herlihy  concluded  that  she  had  no  jurisdiction   to
        entertain the appellant's appeal against the respondent's  decision
        dated 16 June 2016 to refuse her  application  for  an  EEA  Family
        Permit  pursuant  to  the  Immigration  (European  Economic   Area)
        Regulations 2006. Judge Herlihy's  decision  relied  on  the  Upper
        Tribunal decision of Sala [2016] UKUT 0411. This was overturned  by
        the Court of Appeal in Khan v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
        Department [2017] EWCA Civ 1755.


     2. In the light of Khan the First-tier Tribunal was wrong  in  law  to
        conclude that it did not have jurisdiction to hear the appeal.

     3. The Upper Tribunal is consequently satisfied  that  the  First-tier
        Tribunal's decision is  marred  by  a  material  legal  error  (the
        unlawful view that it lacked jurisdiction).

Notice of Decision

The First-tier Tribunal decision is vitiated by a  material  error  of  law.
The case is remitted back to the First-tier Tribunal for a fresh  (de  novo)
hearing, before  a  judge  other  than  judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
Herlihy.
