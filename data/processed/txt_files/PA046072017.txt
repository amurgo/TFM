For the Appellant:     Mr A Govan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr E MacKay, of McGlashan MacKay, Solicitors


                                DETERMINATION

 1. Parties are as above, but the rest of this decision refers to  them  as
    they were in the FtT.

 2. By a decision promulgated on 26 April 2019, FtT Judge Farrelly  allowed
    the appellant's appeal on health grounds  only,  finding  that  removal
    "would be a breach of either articles 3 or 8".

 3. The SSHD appealed to the UT on the grounds that the FtT did not explain
    how the high threshold for medical cases was  reached,  and  failed  to
    apply J v SSHD [2005] EWCA Civ 629 and Y and another v SSHD [2009] EWCA
    Civ 362.

 4. At the first hearing in the UT, Mr  MacKay  referred  to  the  skeleton
    argument for the appellant in the FtT, which cites the medical evidence
    and, at [14 - 15], the six step analysis required by J.   His  "outline
    argument / rule 24 notice" and oral submissions, were on these lines:

      i) the decision of the FtT was to be read in context of  the  evidence
         and of the submissions to it;

     ii) the grounds failed to reflect that;

    iii) the decision showed that the  FtT  was  aware  that  the  appellant
         advanced health grounds as the strongest aspect of his case;

     iv) the decision could be sustained by  reading  the  medical  reports,
         which the FtT accepted, and the skeleton argument, along  with  the
         decision;

      v) the necessary analysis could  be  read,  in  particular,  into  the
         finding  at  [45]  that  "the  risk  is  genuine  and  beyond   the
         appellant's informed choice".

 5. Having reserved the issue of error of law, I reached a  decision  dated
    23 September 2019, repeated in the next four paragraphs.

 6. The FtT mentioned relevant case law at [41, 43, and  44]  but  not  the
    obviously pertinent authorities of J and Y.  The choice of which  cases
    to cite, and which not to cite, was surprising.

 7. Absence of explicit citation of authority is not an error of  law,  and
    parties are taken to be aware of the case put to the Judge.  However, a
    decision must show that the correct legal approach has been adopted.

 8. Although neither party made anything of it, the  decision  of  the  FtT
    came almost 6 months after the hearing, and included no explanation for
    the delay.

 9. Mr MacKay's submissions did their best to read into the  decision  what
    is not there.  Mr Govan was able to show that the several issues  posed
    by Y were not resolved.

10. Parties had asked for the opportunity to prepare  and  advance  further
    submissions, if the decision were to be  set  aside.   Helpfully,  they
    then both provided written submissions, to which  on  17  October  2019
    they had nothing to add.

11. I remake the decision as follows.

12. It was common ground that the legal framework is to be  taken  from  J,
    where the Court said that the test of real risk  was  to  be  amplified
    thus:

         [26]     First, the test requires an assessment to be made  of  the
         severity of the treatment which it is said that the applicant would
         suffer if removed. This must attain a minimum  level  of  severity.
         The court has said on a number of occasions that the assessment  of
         its severity depends on all the circumstances of the case. But  the
         ill-treatment must "necessarily be serious" such  that  it  is  "an
         affront  to  fundamental  humanitarian  principles  to  remove   an
         individual to a country  where  he  is  at  risk  of  serious  ill-
         treatment": see Ullah paras [38-39].


         [27]     Secondly, a causal link must be shown to exist between the
         act or threatened act of  removal  or  expulsion  and  the  inhuman
         treatment relied on as violating the applicant's article 3  rights.
         Thus in Soering at para [91], the court said:


             "In so far as any liability under the Convention is or may  be
             incurred,  it  is  liability  incurred  by   the   extraditing
             Contracting State by reason of its having taken  action  which
             has as a direct consequence the exposure of an  individual  to
             proscribed ill-treatment."(emphasis added).


             See also para [108] of Vilvarajah where the  court  said  that
             the examination of the article 3  issue  "must  focus  on  the
             foreseeable consequences of the removal of the  applicants  to
             Sri Lanka..."


         [28]     Thirdly, in the context of a foreign case, the  article  3
         threshold is particularly high simply because it is a foreign case.
         And it is even higher where the alleged inhuman  treatment  is  not
         the direct or indirect responsibility of the public authorities  of
         the receiving state, but  results  from  some  naturally  occurring
         illness, whether physical or mental. This is  made  clear  in  para
         [49] of D and para [40] of Bensaid.


         [29]     Fourthly, an article 3 claim can in principle succeed in a
         suicide case (para [37] of Bensaid).


         [30]     Fifthly, in deciding whether there is a  real  risk  of  a
         breach of article 3 in a suicide case, a question of importance  is
         whether the applicant's fear  of  ill-treatment  in  the  receiving
         state upon which the risk  of  suicide  is  said  to  be  based  is
         objectively well-founded. If the fear  is  not  well-founded,  that
         will tend to weigh against there being a real risk that the removal
         will be in breach of article 3.


         [31]     Sixthly, a further question of considerable  relevance  is
         whether the removing  and/or  the  receiving  state  has  effective
         mechanisms to reduce the risk of suicide. If  there  are  effective
         mechanisms, that too will  weigh  heavily  against  an  applicant's
         claim that removal will violate his or her article 3 rights.


13. Y adds to the fifth principle:

         [15]     There is no necessary tension between the two things.  The
         corollary of the final sentence of ï¿½30 of J is that in the  absence
         of an objective foundation for the fear some independent basis  for
         it must be established if weight is to be  given  to  it.  Such  an
         independent basis may lie in trauma inflicted in the  past  on  the
         appellant in (or, as here, by) the receiving state: someone who has
         been tortured and raped by his or her captors may be  terrified  of
         returning to the place where it happened, especially  if  the  same
         authorities are in charge, notwithstanding that the objective  risk
         of recurrence has gone.


         [16]     One can accordingly add to the fifth principle in  J  that
         what may nevertheless be of equal importance is whether any genuine
         fear which the appellant may establish, albeit without an objective
         foundation, is such as to create a risk of suicide if there  is  an
         enforced return.


14. The  appellant  founds  on  two  psychiatric  reports,  both  based  on
    interviews, previous reports, and medical records.

15. The report of Dr K Idris, specialty doctor, general  adult  psychiatry,
    is dated 2 September 2018.  In summary, his opinion is as follows:

         [1]      The appellant displays mental state elements  which  might
         qualify for a diagnosis  of  paranoid  schizophrenia,  but  with  a
         present diagnosis of persistent delusional disorder.

         [2]       He  is  on   the   recommended   antipsychotic   therapy,
         risperidone, the  effectiveness  of  which  should  be  continually
         monitored.

         [3]      There may be a  tendency  of  individuals  with  psychotic
         disorder to have increased risk of suicide,  which  may  worsen  at
         times of stress, evidenced by previous  attempts  at  suicide  when
         faced with adversity of threats of deportation and coping with  the
         diagnosis of HIV.  The risks are monitored [in the UK] ...

         [4]      Without access to mental health services, there may  be  a
         likely risk of psychosis and death to  suicide.   I  am  unable  to
         comment on availability of services and treatment in Sri Lanka  ...



16. The report of Dr L Ramsay, consultant forensic psychiatrist,  is  dated
    25 September 2018.  To summarise her opinion:

         [1]      ... [the appellant] ... fulfils the clinical criteria  for
         a diagnosis of  paranoid  schizophrenia  ...  rather  than  one  of
         persistent delusional disorder.

         [2]      [the appellant] requires ongoing treatment and  monitoring
         by specialist services.  His care is complicated by the co-existing
         diagnosis of HIV ...

         [4]      ... [the appellant] has  a  chronic  and  enduring  mental
         illness.  He has a psychotic illness and is at  increased  risk  of
         suicide secondary to this.

         [5]       ...  [the  appellant]  requires  input   from   secondary
         specialist  services  ...  in  the  long  term  and   ...   without
         appropriate care and  treatment  his  mental  state  is  likely  to
         deteriorate rapidly ...

         [6]      [the appellant] can currently continue to be treated as an
         informal patient.  He is entirely compliant with his treatment  and
         has good insight into the nature of his difficulties  ...  if  [the
         appellant], however,  became  non-compliant  ...  he  would  fulfil
         criteria for detention or compulsory treatment ...

         [7]      I am unable to comment on availability of ... services and
         treatment in Sri Lanka.

17. No doubt, the appellant expressed to the psychiatric experts a  genuine
    reluctance to return to Sri Lanka; but that must be  qualified  by  his
    failure to establish that the reason for his reluctance is  a  fear  of
    persecution which is either objectively or subjectively genuine.

18. The submission for the appellant relies heavily on the prognosis if  he
    were not compliant with treatment; but medical opinion is that  he  has
    insight and does comply, so that  is  not  merely  speculative,  it  is
    contrary to the evidence.

19. The submission for the appellant relies  also  on  the  respondent  not
    having provided evidence of removal arrangements, such as  escorts,  or
    evidence of treatment and facilities available in Sri Lanka.

20. The tribunal is entitled to take judicial notice  of  the  respondent's
    duties, and to assume the  respondent's  compliance,  in  managing  the
    removal of vulnerable claimants, including  those  who  may  present  a
    suicide risk.

21. The appellant cites J at [62] as authority to the contrary, but that is
    a misreading.  The Home Office does not have to  establish  in  advance
    how it will specifically comply in an individual case.

22. The onus of establishing his case remains on the appellant, and he  has
    had the benefit of legal representation  during  proceedings  over  the
    last several years.

23. There remains before the UT a report obtained by the appellant  from  a
    country expert, Dr Chris Smith.  The report is  mainly  concerned  with
    the import of matters which the appellant failed to establish, which no
    doubt is why it was not relied upon in the written  submission  on  his
    behalf.  The original report was written in July 2017, with an addendum
    dated 5 November 2018.   This  discloses  that  there  have  been  some
    improvements in mental health care provision in recent years, and  that
    a significant range of medications  is  available,  subsidised  by  the
    government and mostly cheap.

24. The most recent evidence of the appellant's treatment is that he  takes
    risperidone, an anti-psychotic available in Sri  Lanka,  on  undisputed
    information provided by the respondent.

25. Mental health facilities and support organisations in Sri Lanka are not
    the equivalent of those in the UK,  but  they  exist,  particularly  in
    Colombo, where the appellant comes from, and where he has  family  with
    whom he is in touch, including his parents.

26. The submission for the appellant maintains that he "has no insight into
    his illness", and that there is "compelling evidence showing  a  strong
    causal link between removal and high suicide risk".   The  evidence  is
    not there to establish those propositions.

27. To summarise in terms of J and Y:

      i) The evidence does not support the reality of a risk at the  minimum
         level of severity.

     ii) The evidence does not support a causal  link  between  removal  and
         self-harm.

    iii) This is a foreign case.  The alleged outcome is not an act  of  the
         receiving state.  It is the result of an illness,  with  little  to
         show that it would be worsened by removal.

     iv) The claim is available in  principle,  but  not  made  out  on  the
         evidence.

      v)  A  genuine  fear  is  not  established,  either   objectively   or
         subjectively.

     vi) The removing state has effective mechanisms in place, if these were
         required.  The receiving state does not supply a similar  level  of
         care, but that is not a decisive issue, in absence of real risk.

28. The decision of the FtT is set aside.

29. The decision is remade thus: the appeal, as  brought  to  the  FtT,  is
    dismissed.

30. An anonymity direction continues to apply.
