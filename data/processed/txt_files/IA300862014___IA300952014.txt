Representation:
For the claimants:     Mr A Hossain, instructed by A1 Law Chambers
For the appellant:     Mr I Jarvis, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the  determination
    of First-tier Tribunal Judge Chowdhury promulgated  14.11.14,  allowing
    the claimants' linked appeals against the decisions of the Secretary of
    State, dated 8.7.14, to refuse their Tier 1 Entrepreneur and  dependant
    spouse applications made on 3.5.14, and to  remove  them  from  the  UK
    pursuant to section 47 of the Immigration Asylum  and  Nationality  Act
    2006. The Judge heard the appeal on 15.10.14.

 2. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Parker  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    5.1.15.

 3. Thus the matter came before me on 16.2.15 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

 4. I note two emails received by the  Tribunal  from  the  first  claimant
    seeking an  adjournment  of  this  hearing,  because  he  is  allegedly
    suffering from back pain. The second email has an  attachment  being  a
    copy of a sick note issued  by  Dr  Tahir  of  the  Brentfield  Medical
    Centre, dated 13.2.15. This refers to 'Back  pain,  unspecified.'  Also
    attached is a prescription for Naproxen and  Cocodamol,  but  this  was
    issued on 17.7.14, more than 6 months ago.

 5. The application for adjournment was put before an Upper Tribunal  Judge
    who refused it on the basis that in the first instance  the  appeal  is
    listed for an error of law hearing, following which, if the decision is
    set aside, the judge can consider how the application is to proceed.

 6. In the circumstances, notwithstanding the further email request for  an
    adjournment, I consider that the hearing should proceed to the error of
    law consideration.  At the  hearing  Mr  Chowdhury  said  that  he  had
    instructions to proceed and did not pursue the adjournment application.

Error of Law

 7. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Chowdhury should be set aside.

 8. The application of the first claimant was refused because  in  claiming
    to have access to not less  than  �50,000  from  a  registered  Venture
    Capital firm  regulated  by  the  Financial  Conduct  Authority  (FCA),
    pursuant to Attributes under Appendix A of the Immigration  Rules,  the
    Secretary of State concluded that Nomisma Venture Capital, relied on by
    the first claimant, is not an independent venture capital firm directly
    regulated by the FCA.

 9. The first claimant asserted that Nomisma is regulated by  the  FCA,  by
    virtue of its management by Providentia LLP, which  is  authorised  and
    regulated by the FCA. Judge Chowdhury concluded  that  the  Immigration
    Rules contain no requirement that the venture capitalist firm  must  be
    "directly" regulated by the FCA. Accepting the evidence from the expert
    report of Howard Kennedy, referenced at �17 of the decision, the  judge
    concluded that the first claimant met the requirements  of  Appendix  A
    and thus both appeals were allowed.

10. Mr Hossain, who appeared at the  First-tier  Tribunal,  made  the  same
    arguments and relied  on  the  same  evidence  that  was  before  judge
    Chowdhury in his submissions to me.

11. The grounds of appeal submit that the judge erred in law in  concluding
    that Nomisma met the requirements. The grounds also note that this  and
    two  other  venture  capital  companies  all  controlled  by  the  same
    individual, form the subject of some 500  ring-fenced  appeals  pending
    the outcome of ten test cases heard in  Manchester  in  November  2014.
    Evidently,  the  Secretary  of  State  regards  Nomisma  as   a   bogus
    enterprise.

12. Whilst the wording of Appendix A does not use the  words  'independent'
    and 'directly regulated,' it is evident that the plain intention of the
    words used in Table 4, "one or more registered venture capitalist firms
    regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority [FCA]" is  that  the  firm
    must be regulated by the FCA. Nomisma is not regulated by the FCA,  and
    the wording makes  no  allowance  for  being  regulated  indirectly  or
    "through a connected firm," as suggested in �18 of  the  decision.  The
    words of Appendix A do not state that the venture capital firm must  be
    either regulated by the FCA or managed by a firm which is regulated  by
    the FCA. In stating "I have  no  evidence  to  the  contrary  from  the
    respondent that this is not possible and that the Rules cannot be  read
    to include such an arrangement," the judge appears to be reversing  the
    burden of proof which lies on the first claimant.

13. I am quite satisfied that the expectation of Appendix A and Table 4  is
    that the venture capital firm must be one that is regulated by the FCA.
    Whilst Mr Chowdhury relied  on  the  evidence  of  a  so-called  expert
    witness, I do  not  accept  that  person  is  an  expert  in  statutory
    interpretation. Neither does it make any sense for the issue to require
    expert evidence as to whether a firm is or is not regulated by the FCA.



14. In the circumstances, I find that there is  an  error  of  law  in  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal such that it must be set aside  and
    remade.

15. Mr Hossain submitted that I should adjourn the remaking of the decision
    to enable the claimants to attend. However, I cannot see that any  oral
    evidence would be necessary; this [is] a case that could have been done
    on the papers. For his  part,  Mr  Hossain  accepted  that  he  had  no
    different submissions to make than  he  made  both  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal and to me in the error of  law  argument.  There  was  nothing
    further to say about it. Similarly, the Secretary of  State's  position
    is identical to the submissions of  Mr  Jarvis  in  the  error  of  law
    decision. In the circumstances, I can see no purpose  in  wasting  time
    and incurring  additional  cost  by  adjourning  the  remaking  of  the
    decision.

16. Similarly, the very reasons why I found an error of law in the decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal are the same reasons why the appeal must  be
    dismissed. It would make no sense for me to have  been  persuaded  that
    there is an error of law in the interpretation of Appendix A and  Table
    4 to then allow the appeal on some different basis.  On  the  facts  of
    this case the decision in the appeal on immigration grounds must mirror
    the decision in relation to error of law.

17. I note that article 8 was not raised in the grounds of  appeal  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal,  despite  the  one-stop  warning  in  the  refusal
    decision and despite the fact there is a removal decision in this case.
    Article 8 does not appear to have been the subject  of  submissions  or
    evidence in the First-tier Tribunal and Mr Hossain made no  submissions
    on or even mention of article 8 when offered the  opportunity  to  make
    further submissions before I remade the decision. In the  circumstances
    I make no consideration of article 8.

Conclusion & Decision

18. For the reasons set out herein, I find that the making of the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did involve the making  of  an  error  on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

     I set aside the decision

                    I re-make the decision by dismissing the appeal of  each
                    claimant.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal of each appellant has been dismissed and thus there  can
be no fee award.
