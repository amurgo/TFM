                       ERROR OF LAW DECISION & REASONS
                   ______________________________________


1.    The Respondent, to whom I shall refer as the Claimant, is  a  national
of Afghanistan, born on [ ] 1996. He arrived in the  United  Kingdom  on  18
March 2015 and claimed asylum 5 days later. The basis of his claim  is  that
his father had been killed by the Mujahedeen because he was a member of  the
People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA). The Appellant  stated  that
he had been targeted as a member of  the  Nishat  family  and  he  had  been
detained, physically abused and beaten almost daily,  as  a  consequence  of
which he had scarring  and  psychological  symptoms.  He  has  a  number  of
relatives in the United Kingdom,  including  two  brothers,  who  have  been
granted asylum. The Secretary of State rejected his claim on  the  basis  of
credibility and in the absence of medical evidence.

2.    An appeal was lodged against this decision  which  came  before  First
tier Tribunal Judge Quinn for hearing on 3 March 2016. At the outset of  the
appeal hearing, counsel for the Appellant  applied  for  an  adjournment  in
order to  obtain  medical  reports  from  Freedom  from  Torture,  who  were
treating the Appellant. This application was refused on the basis  that  the
Judge considered there had been sufficient time to obtain this  evidence  in
advance of the hearing. The hearing proceeded and the Judge  heard  evidence
from the Appellant and three members of his family.

3.    In a decision dated 17 February 2016, the First  tier  Tribunal  Judge
allowed the appeal. He took into account the oral evidence  and  a  scarring
report prepared by Mr Mason dated 13 August 2015, which confirmed  that  his
scarring was highly consistent with the  Appellant's  account.  At  [18]  he
held:

    "Using that lower standard (of proof) I was satisfied that it was  more
    likely than not that [FN] had been assaulted in  Afghanistan  and  that
    the marks on his body were as a result of those injuries."

At [19] the Judge  took  into  account  that  the  Appellant  was  receiving
counselling for the trauma he had suffered and at [24] found that  he  would
be at risk if returned to Afghanistan, having been detained and tortured  in
the past, that he would be at real risk of serious harm on return.  At  [25]
the Judge held:

    Whilst it was arguable that the Appellant  could  relocate  to  another
    area in Afghanistan the reality was as a young man without a job  or  a
    home he would need to be near to his family to be able to  survive.  If
    he were to live near his family there was a risk of him  being  further
    abused."

The Judge went on to find at [26] that the Appellant would be at  real  risk
of persecution if returned and at [30] that there would be a  real  risk  of
treatment contrary to Article 3 of the ECHR.

4.    In an in-time application  for  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
Tribunal, the Secretary of State argued that the First tier  Tribunal  Judge
had erred materially in law in failing to explore  the  option  of  internal
relocation  further,  particularly  by  reference  to   AK   (Article   15C)
Afghanistan) CG [2012] UKUT 163 (IAC)  at  [253].  She  contended  that  the
Appellant would be able to safely relocate to Kabul  and  it  would  not  be
unduly harsh for him to do so.

5.    Permission  to  appeal  was  granted  by  First  tier  Tribunal  Judge
Grimmett on the basis that it was arguable that the Judge made an  error  as
he appears to have overlooked the country guidance case AK [2012]  UKUT  163
when considering internal  relocation  and  his  conclusion  may  have  been
different had he not done so.

6.    A rule 24 response was submitted on the Claimant's behalf  on  10  May
2016, which argued that:

    (i)    the question being addressed by FtTJ Quinn was different to that
    before the Upper Tribunal in AK (Article 15C)  Afghanistan)  CG  [2012]
    UKUT 163 (IAC) which considered whether the situation in Kabul was such
    as to violate Article 15C of the QD;

    (ii)   the Judge made a clear  finding  that  the  Appellant  had  been
    detained and tortured by the  Afghan  police  and  this  has  not  been
    challenged by the SSHD;

    (iii)  the Judge implicitly found that the risk to the Appellant  would
    be prevalent in the  whole  of  Afghanistan  at  [24]  given  that  the
    Appellant's fear of persecution is from the State;

    (iv)   the FtTJ clearly applied the undue harshness  test  set  out  in
    Januzi [2006] UKHL 5 and AH (Sudan) [2007] UKHL 49. There was no  error
    of law in his approach.

Hearing

7.    At the hearing before me, Ms Brocklesby-Weller sought to rely  on  the
grounds of appeal and submitted that the challenge is to the  reasonableness
of relocation cf. AK (Article 15C) Afghanistan) CG [2012] UKUT 163 (IAC)  at
[253]. The Judge does not engage with why the Claimant would not be able  to
seek out employment and  why  he  needs  his  family  to  support  him.  She
submitted that relocation was a live issue before the  Judge,  otherwise  he
would not have directed himself as he did  at  [24]  &  [25].  It  does  not
appear to be his case that the authorities are actively seeking him. It  was
unclear how in that backdrop this would be an individual who  would  not  be
able to integrate or establish himself either in Kabul or a larger city.

8.    In  response,  Mr  Ritchie  relied  upon  the  Rule  24  response.  He
submitted that the issue of internal relocation was not the matter in  issue
given the findings by the Home Office in  the  refusal  decision  where  the
main issue was credibility at [8]-[10] and the issue of risk on  return  was
based on the SSHD's negative view of the Appellant's credibility. There  was
no alternative finding  about  the  issue  of  internal  relocation  in  the
refusal letter. AK mentioned at [13] but on the basis that  credibility  was
not accepted but on the  basis  that  conditions  in  Kabul  do  not  breach
article 3 of ECHR rather than in circumstances  where  the  Claimant  has  a
well-founded fear of persecution. He submitted that it was  clear  from  the
Claimant's statement and interview that his fear arises in  Kabul  which  is
generally regarded as the safest part of Afghanistan and the city  to  which
he would be returned. The Appellant has been detained and  tortured  in  the
past and would be at a real risk of persecution if returned  cf.  [25].  The
issue in AK is was the article 15C  risk,  which  is  different  from  undue
harshness and the findings at [253] of AK seem to be a  very  fact  specific
assessment of internal relocation in that particular case,  which  does  not
engage with undue harshness and relocation in a refugee context. Mr  Ritchie
submitted that the Judge had not made a material error of law.

9.    Ms Brocklesby-Weller did not exercise her right to respond.



Decision

10.   I found that First tier Tribunal Judge Quinn had not erred  materially
in law and announced my decision at the hearing. I now give my  reasons.  It
is clear from the findings of the First tier Tribunal Judge at [21]  onwards
that she accepted his claim to be at risk of serious harm or persecution  in
Afghanistan on account of being a member of the Neshad  family.  Given  that
his fear of persecution is from the Afghan  authorities,  I  find  that  the
risk to the Claimant would be prevalent throughout Afghanistan and  this  is
the effect of the Judge's finding at [24] that:

    "Taking account of the above I was therefore of the opinion that  there
    was a risk faced by the Appellant if he were to return to  Afghanistan.
    He had been detained and tortured by the Afghan  police  and  that  was
    likely to happen again if he were to be returned to Afghanistan. In  my
    view there is a real risk that he would suffer serious harm  on  return
    to Afghanistan."

11.   Moreover, the Claimant has always consistently maintained that  he  is
from Kabul and thus any consideration of internal relocation would  have  to
be to a place other than Kabul. In these circumstances, I  do  not  see  how
the CG decision in AK (Article 15C) Afghanistan) CG [2012]  UKUT  163  (IAC)
is or was material to the decision of the First tier Tribunal  Judge,  given
the very different factual  matrix  and  the  fact  that  in  AK  the  Upper
Tribunal expressly found that that Appellant could return to  Kabul  because
he had an uncle there who could help him with accommodation and  employment,
whereas the Judge's unchallenged finding in  this  case  at  [25]  was  that
living near a family would put the Claimant at risk of further abuse.

12.   Consequently, I dismiss the appeal by the Secretary of State  for  the
Home Department, with the effect that the decision of  First  tier  Tribunal
Judge Quinn allowing the appeal on asylum and Article 3 grounds is upheld.
