                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    This is an appeal, by the , against  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Anwen Walker), sitting at Newport on 17 April 2015,  to
    a deportation appeal by a citizen of Angola, born 5  August  1983.  The
    appellant had received a permanent residence  card  on  19  June  2007,
    after arriving here in 1998 with his mother,  a  citizen  of  Portugal,
    getting an ordinary residence card in 2002, and five years living  here
    after that. Besides various lesser offences before, he was sentenced on
    21 March 2014 to 18 months' imprisonment for a  'confidence'  burglary,
    and the decision under appeal followed on 14 November.

 2. The judge cited almost all the potentially  relevant  legislation  with
    great industry; but for the EEA issues involved in  this  hearing,  the
    most that need be set out  is  this,  starting  from  reg.  19  of  the
    Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations  2006   [the   EEA
    Regulations]:

         (3)  Subject to paragraphs (4) and (5), an  EEA  national  who  has
             entered the United Kingdom or the  family  member  of  such  a
             national who has entered the United Kingdom may be removed if-

             (a)    ...

             (b)    the Secretary of State has decided  that  the  person's
                  removal is justified on grounds of public  policy,  public
                  security [or public health] in accordance with  regulation
                  21; or

             (c)    ...

         (4)  ...

         (5)  A person must not be removed under paragraph (3) if he  has  a
             right to remain in the  United  Kingdom  by  virtue  of  leave
             granted under the 1971 Act unless his removal is justified  on
             the grounds of  public  policy,  public  security  [or  public
             health] in accordance with regulation 21.

 3. The potentially relevant parts of reg. 21 are these:

         (1)  ... a 'relevant decision' means an EEA decision taken  on  the
             grounds of public policy, public security [or public health].

         (2)  A relevant decision may not be taken to serve economic ends.

         (3)  A relevant decision may not be taken in respect  of  a  person
             with a right of  residence  under  regulation  15  [which  for
             present purposes includes this appellant]  except  on  serious
             grounds of public security or public policy

         (4)  A relevant decision may not  be  taken  except  on  imperative
             grounds of public security in respect of an EEA national who -

             a)     has resided in the  United  Kingdom  for  a  continuous
                  period of at least ten years prior to [sic]  the  relevant
                  decision ...

         (5)  Where a relevant decision is taken on grounds of public policy
             or public security it shall, in addition to complying with the
             preceding  paragraphs  of  this  regulation,   be   taken   in
             accordance with the following principles-

             (a)     the  decision  must  comply  with  the  principle   of
                  proportionality;

             (b)    the decision must be based exclusively on the  personal
                  conduct of the person concerned;

             (c)    the personal  conduct  of  the  person  concerned  must
                  represent a  genuine,  present  and  sufficiently  serious
                  threat affecting  one  of  the  fundamental  interests  of
                  society;

             (d)    matters isolated from the particulars of  the  case  or
                  which relate to considerations of  general  prevention  do
                  not justify the decision;

             (e)    a person's previous  criminal  convictions  do  not  in
                  themselves justify the decision.

 4. While the grounds of appeal contain criticisms of the judge's  decision
    on proportionality, the reason why the applicant was  given  permission
    to appeal was about her statement of the criteria for  deportation.  At
    paragraph 84 of her exceptionally painstaking decision,  she   set  out
    the criterion at reg. 21 (5) (c) in almost its very words ("a  genuine,
    present and sufficiently serious threat affecting ... the ... interests
    of society"), which applies to all cases under the Regulations; but she
    said nothing about the criterion at 21 ("serious [my emphasis]  grounds
    of public security or public policy"), which applies to all those where
    the person concerned has, like this appellant,  a  permanent  right  of
    residence. It is agreed that the judge did not need to consider reg. 21
    (4), since that applies only to 'EEA nationals' themselves, and not  to
    their family members.

 5. So  far  as  the  European  jurisprudence  is  concerned,  the  leading
    authority on the questions posed by reg. 21  (3)  is  Onuekwere  [2014]
    EUECJ C-378/12. If this appellant had needed to rely on a recent period
    of residence to claim a permanent  right  to  it,  then  the  necessary
    continuity would have been broken by his time in  prison.  However,  he
    had already acquired a permanent right of residence in 2007, and  could
    only lose that either by over two consecutive years' absence (see  reg.
    15 (2)), or by an order for his removal under reg. 21 (3).  It  follows
    that the judge needed to consider whether there were  'serious  grounds
    of public security or public policy' for that.

 6. While Mr Clarke made a valiant attempt to persuade me that the  judge's
    consideration of whether the appellant presented  "a  genuine,  present
    and sufficiently serious threat affecting  ...  the  ...  interests  of
    society" under reg. 21 (5) could be regarded as dealing also  with  the
    requirements of reg. 21 (3), I cannot  agree.  It  is  clear  from  the
    juxtaposition of the two clauses that the intention was that (3) should
    add something to (5), and that intention has to be respected.

 7. The judge rightly set out the sentencing  judge's  remarks  about  what
    this appellant had done, at some length; but for present purposes it is
    enough to note that he and an accomplice had equipped  themselves  with
    documentation to deceive their vulnerable victim into  parting  with  a
    ring of personal value to him, by pretending to be debt collectors. The
    sentencing judge took as his starting-point the upper end of the  range
    for category 2 confidence burglaries, on the  basis  that  it  did  not
    involve 'greater harm', but did involve  'higher  culpability'  on  the
    basis of  the  planning,  involving  more  than  one  person,  and  the
    deception used. With the appropriate discount for plea, that led  to  a
    sentence of 18 months' imprisonment.

 8. Given those facts, it is neither possible to say that this  appellant's
    crime either inevitably did, or inevitably  did  not  provide  'serious
    grounds of public security' for his removal. Whether it did or not will
    be for the judge to decide, on all the relevant  facts,  following  the
    fresh hearing which I am directing.
