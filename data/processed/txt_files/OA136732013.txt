For the Appellant:     Mr T Melvin, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Miss A Benfield, Tamil Relief Centre



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant (hereafter the Entry Clearance Officer  or  ECO)  appeals
    with permission against the determination of First-tier Tribunal  (FtJ)
    Judge Harris sent on 18  February  2014  allowing  the  appeal  of  the
    respondent (hereafter the claimant) protesting the decision of the  ECO
    dated 17 May 2013 refusing to grant entry clearance as a  spouse.

Immigration Rules

2.   The FtT judge first considered that the  claimant  could  not  meet  in
    full the financial requirement of the Immigration Rules under paragraph
    EC-P.1.(d) of Appendix FM (E-ECP.3.1).  There was  no  reply  from  the
    claimant disputing this aspect of the judge's  decision  nor  did  Miss
    Benfield seek to pursue it before me.  As the appeal  to  the  FtT  was
    against an ECO decision, it was governed by S.85A of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and as such the judge  was  obliged  to
    consider how matters stood at the date of decision in May 2013  and  at
    that time it was manifest that the claimant had not met  the  financial
    requirements. Hence the only issue concerns  the  judge's  decision  to
    allow the appeal on Article 8 grounds.

Article 8

3.   The reasons given by the FtT Judge for allowing the  claimant's  appeal
    on Article 8 grounds were essentially that the claimant and her husband
    had a genuine and subsisting  marriage,  that  they  intended  to  live
    together permanently in the UK and that  as  the  sponsor  had  refugee
    status there were insurmountable obstacles to  him  relocating  to  Sri
    Lanka.

4.   It is argued by the ECO in the grounds that the judge failed  to  apply
    properly the guidance set out by the Upper Tribunal in Gulshun (Article
    8 - new rules - correct approach) [2013] UKUT 00640 and had not applied
    the correct criterion when considering whether outside the Rules  there
    were compelling circumstances not sufficiently recognised  under  them.
    Mr Melvin also submitted that it was  observable  that  the  judge  had
    effectively reduced the proportionality  assessment  to  the  issue  of
    insurmountable obstacles.

5.   Whilst criticisms can  be  made  of  the  FtT  Judge's  proportionality
    assessment, I consider this to be a case in which great weight needs to
    be accorded to the  guidance  given  by  the  Court  of  Appeal  in  MF
    (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ 1192, in particular the  emphasis  placed  by
    the court in this judgment on substance as opposed to form.  The  court
    made  clear  that  what  matters  is  not  so  much  whether  there  is
    consideration of Article 8 inside or  outside  the  Rules  or  under  a
    mixture of both but rather whether the decision-maker has  conducted  a
    substantive assessment taking into account all relevant elements of the
    claim.  Whilst the judge did not in terms apply the language in Gulshun
    and the criterion of exceptional  or  compelling  circumstances,  I  am
    satisfied that his approach fulfilled that requirement.   The  claimant
    was the spouse of a refugee and if she and he had been  better  advised
    could have made an application  under  paragraph  352D,  a  rule  which
    imposed no financial requirements on the applicant.  Although Mr Melvin
    is right the FtT Judge did not expressly consider the longevity of  the
    couple's relationship, it is clear that the  judge  knew  and  accepted
    that they had met in October 2011, had married (in Italy)  in  February
    2012 and that they were in a genuine and subsisting relationship  which
    they intended to maintain permanently.   Put  another  way,  the  judge
    accepted that they enjoyed a strong  family  life.   It  is  true  that
    Strasbourg  jurisprudence  recognises  that  it  is  legitimate  for  a
    contracting state to apply  Immigration  Rules  that  impose  financial
    requirements on couples, but equally that jurisprudence recognises that
    the balancing exercise is a fact-specific one and it is clear that  the
    judge was quite  satisfied  that  the  sponsor  could  accommodate  and
    provide for his spouse, the sponsor having earned in six months of self-
    employment the equivalent of ï¿½23,734 per annum (paragraph 22).

6.    Mr  Melvin  has  argued  that  the  judge  effectively   reduced   the
    proportionality  assessment  to  a  consideration   of   insurmountable
    obstacles, but the judge's language at paragraph 44 indicates  that  he
    had considered relevant factors in the round - see paragraph 44  -  and
    that factors other than insurmountable obstacles were addressed.

7.   Mr Melvin highlighted the point raised in the written grounds that  the
    judge himself had noted it was open to the claimant  to  make  a  fresh
    application as soon as the sponsor met the financial requirements,  but
    then seemed to ignore it.  Once again, the  text  indicates  otherwise.
    The  judge  certainly  weighed  this  factor   against   the   claimant
    (paragraphs 37-38) but clearly concluded it was not decisive.

8.   I remind myself that it is only open to me  to  interfere  with  a  FtT
    decision if it contains a material error of law;  my  task  is  not  to
    consider whether the decision was necessarily one  that  another  judge
    would have come to.  The judge's decision, although open to some degree
    of criticism, evinces a substantive consideration of  relevant  factors
    weighing for and against the claimant and for the above reasons is  not
    vitiated by legal error.

9.   The FtT judge did not err in law and his decision to allow  the  appeal
    on Article 8 grounds shall stand.
