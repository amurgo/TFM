Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, PT, date of birth 14.12.72, is a citizen of Zimbabwe.

 2. This is his appeal against the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Devlin promulgated 20.11.14, dismissing his appeal against the decision
    of the Secretary of State to refuse his asylum, humanitarian protection
    and human rights claims.  The Judge heard the appeal on 24.10.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge  Osborne  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    22.12.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 12.11.15 as an appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. For the reasons set out below, I find no error of law in the making  of
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal such as to require the decision
    of Judge Devlin to be set aside.

 6. The asylum claim is founded on fear of persecution and/or  mistreatment
    on return to Zimbabwe due to political opinion and to membership  of  a
    particular social group (PSG) as a gay man. The relevant background can
    be summarised briefly as follows. The appellant  claims  to  have  been
    discrete about his gay sexual orientation whilst in  Zimbabwe,  but  in
    1998 was caught by a cousin and his secret revealed to his father,  who
    threw him out and in the process discovered that the appellant had been
    printing MDC flyers. He  claims  that  his  father  is  the  son  of  a
    prominent Zimbabwean political figure closely associated with  Zanu-PF.
    He had been a student in the UK in 1993 and returned in November  2000,
    but became an  overstayer.  The  police  arrested  him  on  14.2.01  on
    suspicion of fraud. He was granted bail but did not  attend  the  court
    hearing. Instead he obtained a travel document and returned to Zimbabwe
    in April 2001. However, he came back to  the  UK  on  29.8.02  using  a
    passport in a false identity. He remained in the UK illegally  and  did
    not claim asylum until 2012. He fears his father, his family, and  Zanu
    PF, because he is gay and because he was printing MDC  materials  prior
    to the formation of the MDC in November 1998.

 7. At �10 of the refusal decision, dated 10.8.14, the Secretary  of  State
    accepts that the appellant is  a  Zimbabwean  national,  based  on  his
    languages of English and Shona, "In  addition  there  are  Home  Office
    records showing that you arrived on a Zimbabwean passport  in  November
    2000. In the absence of compelling  evidence  to  the  contrary  it  is
    accepted you are a Zimbabwean national." The refusal decision  goes  on
    to reject both the claims of homosexuality and political activity as  a
    MDC activist in Zimbabwe. However, the claims are also rejected on  the
    alternative basis that even if true  on  the  background  evidence  the
    appellant does not face a real risk of persecution or serious  harm  on
    account of his sexuality and there is no general  risk  of  persecution
    for MDC members in Zimbabwe at the present time. It is also stated that
    he could relocate away from  his  home  area  and  notes  that  he  had
    returned to Zimbabwe without facing difficulties.

 8. In  a  careful,  comprehensive  and  detailed  decision,  Judge  Devlin
    rejected the appellant's account of political activity in  Zimbabwe  on
    behalf of the MDC. The Judge was not satisfied he had  demonstrated  to
    the lower standard of proof that he is a member of the family  asserted
    to be of high profile and politically prominent in  Zimbabwe.  Although
    the judge accepted the appellant is gay, his account of being found out
    and his sexuality disclosed to his father  was  rejected  and  was  not
    satisfied that he would choose  to  live  openly  as  a  homosexual  in
    Zimbabwe. The judge also  rejected  Mr  Schwenk's  arguments  that  the
    appellant would face discrimination as a HIV sufferer with a STD and be
    denied access to medication on grounds of his sexuality or being a  HIV
    sufferer. Neither did the judge accept that he would  face  prosecution
    and imprisonment for have left using false documents.

 9. One  of  the  grounds  of  appeal  is  the  judge's  rejection  of  the
    appellant's claimed name and identity as PT and thus by surname and  in
    factual relationship to be part of an allegedly powerful Zanu PF family
    in Zimbabwe, named in the case papers. Mr Schwenk referred  to  �10  of
    the refusal decision, cited above, and argued that  the  appellant  had
    arrived in the UK in 2000 on a Zimbabwean passport in the name  of  PT,
    which has been retained by the Secretary of State but not produced.  It
    is also claimed that at the CMR hearing  of  17.9.14  the  Home  Office
    Presenting Officer accepted the appellant's identity as PT. Mr  Schwenk
    submitted that the Secretary of State accepted his identity and thus it
    was an error of law for the judge to raise this issue in  the  decision
    and find to the contrary.

10. I do not accept Mr Schwenk's argument. The refusal  decision  does  not
    concede the appellant's identity at all,  merely  his  nationality.  It
    appears that the Home Office did not seize the passport referred to  as
    having been used in 2000, but according to the information provided  by
    Ms Johnstone, it was taken from him by the police when he was  arrested
    in February  2001.  The  refusal  decision  refers  to  the  source  of
    information being "Home Office records" in relation  to  his  entry  in
    2000, no doubt a  record  made  on  his  entry.  I  have  examined  the
    handwritten CMR record in the case file before me and  it  contains  no
    reference to identity having been agreed or conceded, as I notified  Mr
    Schwenk at the hearing. The refusal decision does not directly  address
    the claimed family connection.

11. I find no error in the way in which the judge dealt with this issue. It
    is common ground that in  2001  the  appellant  returned  to  Zimbabwe,
    having applied for a travel document in his own name. He  also  applied
    for and obtained a passport in his own name in order to  come  back  to
    the UK in 2002. In assessing the credibility of his factual claims  the
    judge considered at �72 the reasons why he returned to Zimbabwe in 2001
    and the circumstances of that return. At �85 the judge pointed out that
    acceptance of the appellant's account of having returned  in  order  to
    avoid the publicity that might be  attendant  on  his  prosecution  and
    deportation was first, so far-fetched and contrary to reason as  to  be
    incapable of belief, and second, depended on his identity and  being  a
    member of the named powerful family closely associated with Zanu-PF. In
    his asylum interview he was asked for evidence of his identity and this
    family connection. He later produced a number of documents, including a
    birth certificate.  The  judge  noted  that  he  did  not  produce  the
    emergency travel document,  his  national  identity  card  or  driver's
    licence with which he obtained the travel document and thus they do not
    appear to have been available to the Secretary of State. At the hearing
    before me, but  not  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  the  appellant
    produced  a  letter  from  his  former  solicitors,   dated   27.12.12,
    purporting to enclose copies of the birth certificates. However, it was
    addressed to the Northwest Enforcement and Compliance team in Liverpool
    and it is far from clear this was received or seen by the Secretary  of
    State prior to the making of the decision. The  birth  certificate  and
    emergency travel document were before the judge at the appeal  hearing,
    together with witness statements purporting to confirm the  appellant's
    name and identity. The judge was entitled to consider this evidence  in
    the round in the context of the evidence as a whole, but evidently  was
    unpersuaded of the reliability of the documents.

12. In all the circumstances, I reject this ground of appeal as  unfounded;
    the Secretary of State neither accepted nor conceded  his  identity  or
    claimed relationship to the allegedly powerful political family.  I  am
    satisfied that if the identity had been accepted that would  have  been
    made clear at �10 of the refusal decision. I find that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal was entitled to reach the conclusion, for which cogent reasons
    have been provided, that the appellant had failed to  demonstrate  that
    he is PT and related to a powerful Zanu-PF family as claimed.

13. The grounds also assert  that  the  judge  erred  in  law  by  unfairly
    conducting his  own  post-hearing  research  and  taking  into  account
    evidence that was not before the Tribunal.

14. A key claim of the appellant's factual account was  that  he  had  been
    involved in printing stationery for MDC in November  1998.  At  Q51  he
    said he was hated by his father for printing stuff for MDC flyers ahead
    of the launch of the MDC. At Q52 he claimed he had done  this  printing
    in November 1998 and it was discovered when he was thrown  out  of  the
    house in December 1998. �12 of the refusal decision explains  that  the
    Secretary of State did not find this claim credible  because  according
    to the MDC's own website, the  MDC  was  not  formally  launched  until
    September 1999, following an initial meeting of 700 in February 1999 at
    which it was decided to challenge Zanu-PF's policies. It is pointed out
    that the appellant claims to be printing MDC material at  a  time  when
    there was no concrete plan to establish the MDC as a  political  party,
    or even to give a name to the party. Unsurprisingly, both the Secretary
    of State  and  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  found  the  claim  not
    credible.  There could be no party name, logo, manifesto or other  such
    information to put on flyers and thus no purpose to the  production  of
    the same.

15. The Secretary of State cited the source for the information  about  the
    formation of the MDC as being the MDC's official website,  setting  out
    the hyperlink to the website. This put the appellant on notice  as  the
    source of the information relied on. It was a matter for the  appellant
    whether he or his representatives bothered to check the information  or
    its accuracy. No challenge was made to the information  at  the  First-
    tier Tribunal. The judge was not only entitled but obliged to  consider
    this issue. This was done very carefully between �34  and  �50,  citing
    the wording of the website and concluding at �35, as had the  Secretary
    of State, that in November  1998  there  was  no  such  party,  and  no
    concrete plan to form such a party.  The  appellant  had  attempted  to
    answer this criticism by �31 of his witness statement, suggesting  that
    it was a loose collection of individuals who formed an opposition  that
    was distributing documentation against  Zanu-PF,  and  that  opposition
    parties are always formed over a period of time before being  launched.
    The judge also considered the  background  information  which  confirms
    that the party was not formed until September 1999.

16. Although the judge went into some detail about what  was  said  on  the
    website about the formation of the party, addressing  the  issue  in  a
    comprehensive and detailed way, and comparing the  information  on  the
    website with the appellant's explanation, there was nothing  relied  on
    that was any different in essence to the information or  reasons  given
    by the Secretary of State. At �48 the  judge  found  that  even  making
    allowances for differences in meaning, it was "very difficult to accept
    that anyone would describe  November  1998  materials  as  having  been
    printed "pre" or "ahead of the launch of the MDC, which took  place  in
    September 1999." The  appellant's  witness  statement  explanation  was
    reject and the judge found his account made no sense,  concluding  that
    the claimed printing could not have had anything to do with the MDC  or
    its launch. The difference between the meanings of two phrases was  not
    material and either meaning did not in fact assist the appellant.

17. In the circumstances, I find that the judge was entitled to look at the
    website relied on as source material. The appellant had  had  the  same
    opportunity and made his witness statement response. What the judge did
    does not fall into the category of prohibited post-hearing research, or
    reliance on material not before the Tribunal. The bottom line  is  that
    however detailed the analysis, the conclusion was the same and for  the
    same reason as that given by the  Secretary  of  State.  There  was  no
    procedural unfairness or unfair disadvantage to the appellant.  I  thus
    reject this ground of appeal.

18. The grounds also assert that the assessment of the background  evidence
    was flawed, by the failure of the judge to  show  "sufficient  evidence
    that he has considered the evidence from GALZ." This material is relied
    on to suggest that as a homosexual the appellant will be denied  access
    to  antiretroviral  treatment  for  his  HIV  status  and   that   such
    discrimination amounts to persecution.

19. However, it is clear from the decision that the  judge  addressed  this
    issue in some detail between �173 and �192. The  judge  considered  the
    relevant country guidance cases of RS & Ors (Zimbabwe - AIDS)  Zimbabwe
    CG [2010] UKUT 363 (IAC), and LZ (homosexuals) Zimbabwe CG [2011]  UKUT
    487 (IAC), in the light of Mr Schwenk's submissions.  The  judge  noted
    that he could only depart from the country  guidance  where  there  are
    very strong  grounds  supported  by  cogent  evidence  to  justify  not
    following the country guidance. At �180 the judge confirmed that he had
    considered the background material relied on by Mr Schwenk  with  care.
    However, the judge concluded this evidence did not demonstrate that gay
    men with HIV were being denied treatment, or that the shortage of anti-
    retroviral drugs had been engineered to discriminate against them.

20. I find that the judge gave proper and  adequate  consideration  to  the
    background material, providing reasons for attributing  limited  weight
    to some of it. The judge does not have to list all the  evidence  taken
    into account, provided that it is clear from the  decision  that  there
    has been a careful assessment of all the evidence  in  the  round.  The
    judge concluded, for reasons set out in the decision that consideration
    of the evidence in the round did not justify departing from the country
    guidance. The judge thus was not satisfied at �192 that  the  appellant
    would be denied access to appropriate medication on grounds  of  either
    his sexuality or that he is an HIV sufferer. I find that this ground is
    no more than a disagreement with the findings and  conclusions  of  the
    judge.

Conclusions:

21. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

                    I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal against the decision of the  Secretary  of  State
                    remains dismissed on all grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction.

Given the circumstances, I make an anonymity order.


Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: No fee is payable in this case and thus there can be no fee award.
