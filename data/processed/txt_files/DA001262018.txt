Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr T Lindsay, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    In person


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Secretary of State appeals with permission against the decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal allowing  the  claimant's  appeal  against  the
    Secretary of State's decision to deport  him  to  his  EEA  country  of
    origin, Latvia  in  accordance  with  Regulations  23  and  27  of  the
    Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016.

 2. The First-tier Judge found as a fact that the claimant was not entitled
    to more than the basic level protection and  therefore,  although  this
    does not appear to have  been  taken  into  account  in  the  decision,
    questions of rehabilitation, even had any taken place, would not assist
    the claimant.

 3. The history is that in September 2011 the claimant was  caught  driving
    with excess alcohol.  He gave a false name.   He  was  not  caught  out
    until 2017, by which time he claimed to be living with a Ms [S], also a
    Latvian, and that they had two children together.  It  is  quite  right
    that Ms [S] does have two children, but the claimant's  name  does  not
    appear on the birth certificates and the judge made no clear finding as
    to whether it was accepted that he is  in  fact  the  father  of  those
    children.

 4. On 2 October 2017 the claimant was convicted of driving a motor vehicle
    with excess alcohol and resisting or obstructing arrest and fined  �100
    plus costs and victim surcharge and disqualified for twelve months.

 5. On 28 September 2017 he  was  convicted  of  failure  to  surrender  to
    custody and fined �50 and on 30 October 2017 the claimant was convicted
    of an act or series of acts with intention to  pervert  the  course  of
    justice and imprisoned for eight months.  The act in  question  is  the
    giving of a false name in 2011 and the continuing not to  hand  himself
    in and allow justice to take its course.

 6. At paragraph 50 of the First-tier  Tribunal  decision,  the  sentencing
    judge's remarks are set out and in particular the sentencing judge said
    this:

         "You gave a false name thereby  avoiding  being  taken  before  the
         magistrates and punished.  No doubt you thought you  had  got  away
         with it but subsequently it's come to the notice of the police that
         you committed this offence and you have not got away with it.   You
         have been dealt with for the original offence  by  the  magistrates
         but the serious nature of this sort of offence is that  it  strikes
         at the heart of the criminal justice system ... Had you not come to
         the attention of the police later you would no doubt have got  away
         with  it  completely.   I  consider  that  an  immediate  custodial
         sentence is inevitable.  I give you full credit for your early plea
         of guilty."

 7. The OASys Report is not before us and it seems that perhaps  there  was
    not one.   The  basic  custody  screening  report  indicated  that  the
    claimant presented an 11% risk of reoffending  within  two  years.   At
    paragraph 55 of the decision the judge says this:

         "I  accept  there  is  little  evidence  of  remorse  or   of   any
         rehabilitative  work  having   been   undertaken.    However,   the
         [claimant] was not directed to take any such courses in  prison  or
         when released on licence.  Probation have not  been  involved  with
         him as his offending was not considered sufficiently  serious.   It
         is hard  to  see  how  the  [claimant]  could  be  described  as  a
         persistent offender as his  convictions  all  stem  from  the  same
         incident in 2011 and he  is  regarded  as  having  a  low  risk  of
         reconviction.

         The original offence of driving with excess alcohol took  place  in
         2011 and the [claimant] has not  offended  since  then  apart  from
         resisting arrest in 2017 for which he was fined by the magistrates.
          The details of this matter are  not  described  anywhere  but  the
         sentence would not appear to indicate a serious offence.  There  is
         nothing  to  suggest  that  the  police  officer  would  have  been
         traumatised as is suggested in the refusal  letter.   I  also  take
         account that the level of alcohol in the [claimant]'s blood put him
         at the lowest end of  the  sentencing  guidelines  and  no  similar
         offending has occurred in the five years since then."

 8. On that basis the First-tier Judge found as a fact  that  the  claimant
    did not represent a present or sufficiently serious threat  to  justify
    deportation and that therefore the respondent's  decision  was  not  in
    accordance with Regulations 23 and 27.

 9. The judge then stated erroneously that it was not necessary to go on to
    consider Article  8  ECHR  proportionality.   Questions  of  Article  8
    proportionality are not a matter for an EEA application  in  any  event
    and need to be the subject of a separate application, but nothing turns
    on that.

10. The respondent argues that insufficient weight was given to the offence
    of resisting arrest in 2017, and that  combined  with  the  conduct  in
    refusing for six years to disclose that he was the person caught with a
    motor vehicle and too much alcohol in his blood and also, although this
    was not argued this morning but it is in the grounds, the fact that  it
    appears that Ms [S] is claiming benefits on the basis of his not  being
    the father of the children, means that there is a material error of law
    in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal and that  the  outcome,  had
    the judge  given  more  weight  to  the  claimant's  offending  and  in
    particular the second offence, might well have been different.

11. I accept that there are errors of reasoning  in  the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal.   This decision is set aside and will be remade in
    the First-tier Tribunal on a date to be fixed.

Conclusions

There is a material error of law in this decision.

It will be set aside and remade in the First-tier Tribunal on a date  to  be
fixed.
