Representation:

For the appellant:     Ms P Solanki, instructed by Biruntha Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr G Harrison, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, SA, date of birth 23.10.74, and her husband,  AS,  dated
    of birth 30.1.71, with two non-appellant  children,  born  7.10.03  and
    7.1.06, are citizens of Sri Lanka.

 2. These are their linked appeal against the determination  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Roberston,  who  dismissed  their  appeals  against  the
    decision of the respondent, dated 30.4.14 &  7.5.14,  to  refuse  their
    asylum, humanitarian protection and human  rights  claims.   The  Judge
    heard the appeal on 20.6.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge Macdonald granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    18.7.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 13.10.14 as an appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Robertson should be set aside.

 6. In essence, the grounds of appeal assert that the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge erred in failing to adjourn  the  case  to  allow  an  all-female
    court, erred in her approach to the medical evidence of  Drs  Lord  and
    Ghosh, and erred in the approach to the appellant's health claim  under
    article 8 ECHR. Effectively, it is claimed that the judge made  up  her
    mind on  the  issue  of  credibility  before  considering  the  medical
    evidence.

 7. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Macdonald found no merit in the
    adjournment ground. However, noting  that  both  medical  reports  were
    strongly supportive of the first appellant's account of rape  and  ill-
    treatment and that she has been suffering from the effects of that ill-
    treatment thereafter,  "It  is  arguable,  for  reasons  given  in  the
    grounds, that the judge failed to factor in the terms  of  the  medical
    reports before concluding that the accounts given before her  were  not
    credible - the Mibanga point."

 8. "As the judge noted it is only if there were arguably good grounds  for
    doing so that it was necessary for her to consider article 8. She  gave
    clear reasons for finding that exceptional circumstances had  not  been
    established.  Nevertheless,  for  reasons  relating  to  the   arguably
    inadequate assessment of the medical evidence, permission to appeal  is
    granted... on all grounds."

Failure to adjourn the hearing

 9. The reasons given  for  seeking  an  all-female  Tribunal  hearing  was
    because the first appellant claimed that she did not  feel  comfortable
    speaking about some of the things that  had  happened  to  her  with  a
    male. At �7 of the determination the judge noted that counsel  for  the
    appellants was "anxious to proceed in spite of the fact that  both  the
    interpreter and the Presenting Officer were male." In other words,  the
    judge was being urged to proceed and not to adjourn the  hearing.   The
    request had been made only 2 days before the hearing and was refused on
    application because it was not raised at the preceding CMR  of  5.6.14.
    The judge noted that at no time did the first appellant appear to be or
    state that she was distressed by the questioning from a male presenting
    officer or the presence of a male interpreter.

10. Ms Solanki submitted that despite instructed counsel's request for  the
    case to proceed the judge should have, of her own motion, adjourned the
    appeal hearing. I reject that submission. It has  to  be  assumed  that
    instructed counsel would have had the best  opportunity  to  judge  the
    situation and best  represent  the  interests  of  her  client.  It  is
    inconceivable that the request to proceed was not made without  express
    instructions and agreement of the first appellant. If she  was  willing
    to proceed in the circumstances, there was no basis for  the  judge  to
    take a different view. I find that there is thus no merit in the ground
    of appeal relating to adjournment.

11. Treatment of Medical Evidence

12. Ms Solanki took me to various parts of  the  medical  reports  and  the
    determination to suggest that the consideration of the medical evidence
    was made after the detailed credibility findings between �26  and  �47.
    She also submitted that the treatment of the medical  evidence  in  the
    determination was inconsistent with the contents of the report. For the
    reasons set out herein, I do not accept these  submissions  demonstrate
    any material error of law.

13. The Rule 24 response, dated  30.7.14,  submitted  that  the  judge  had
    directed herself appropriately, point to �25  where  the  judge  stated
    that the findings were made after consideration of all the evidence  in
    the round and that this self-direction was repeated, stating  that  the
    findings were made with regard to the evidence as  a  composite  whole.
    "It is clear that there was no error in respect of the judge's approach
    to the evidence before him. Mibanga did not  require  that  a  decision
    maker  considered  the  medical  evidence  first   in   his   findings.
    Furthermore, Mibanga was a case that  turned  on  its  very  particular
    facts."

14. Reference was also made by the Secretary of State  to  HH  Medical  the
    Evidence Effective Mibanga  Ethiopia  [2005]  UKAIT  00164,  where  the
    Tribunal held that there was a danger of Mibanga  being  misunderstood.
    "Judgements in that case  are  not  intended  to  place  judicial  fact
    finders in a form of forensic straightjacket. In particular, the  Court
    of Appeal is not to be regarded as laying down any rule of  law  as  to
    the order in which judicial fact finders are to approach the evidential
    materials before them.  To  take  Wilson  J's  cake  analogy,  all  its
    ingredients cannot be thrown together into the bowl simultaneously. One
    has to start somewhere. There is nothing illogical about the process by
    which the immigration judge in the present case chose to  approach  his
    analytical task."

15. For the reasons set out herein I find that it is  unfair  to  criticise
    the judge for the order in  which  the  evidence  was  dealt  with.  In
    particular I find no evidence that the judge  inappropriately  excluded
    the medical evidence from the assessment  of  credibility.  However,  I
    also find that the extent to which the medical  evidence  could  assist
    the credibility assessment was rather limited  on  the  facts  of  this
    case. The claim is that because of  the  authorities  interest  in  the
    second appellant's involvement in the diversion of funds to  the  LTTE,
    that the first appellant was taken in for questioning and subjected  to
    ill-treatment. After a very detailed examination  of  the  evidence  in
    relation to the second appellant's claim, the judge found that  he  was
    not involved in money as claimed, his account of the method and reasons
    for transfer lacking credibility. When the judge came to  consider  the
    credibility of the first appellant, she took into  account  the  extent
    and limitations of the medical evidence and also the finding  that  the
    second appellant's factual account of money transfer was not  credible.
    I find no error of law in that approach.

16. I note that at �25 of the  determination  the  judge  stated  that  she
    embarked on her  findings  of  fact  on  the  evidence  in  the  round,
    exercising  caution  with  regard  to  credibility  and   plausibility,
    assessing the evidence  against  the  background  evidence.  The  judge
    specifically stated that, "Although  I  set  out  my  findings  on  the
    various aspects of the Appellants'  credibility  sequentially,  I  have
    taken  all  the  evidence  as  a  composite  whole   in   reaching   my
    conclusions." At �26 the judge considered whether mental health  issues
    were likely  to  cause  the  first  appellant  difficulties  in  giving
    evidence during the hearing, but concluded that they did not,  for  the
    reasons stated.

17. At that point the  judge  also  recorded  that  she  had  notified  the
    parties, in advance of the evidence and thus findings of fact, that she
    would apply KV (scarring - medical  evidence)  Sri  Lanka  [2014]  UKUT
    00230 (IAC), in the assessment of the medical  evidence.  It  is  clear
    that the medical evidence was at the forefront of the judge's mind when
    considering the evidence. That  decision  held  that  "whilst  if  best
    practice  is  followed  medico-legal  reports  will  make  a   critical
    evaluation of a claimant's account of scarring said to have been caused
    by torture, such reports cannot be equated with  an  assessment  to  be
    undertaken by decision-makers in a legal context in which the burden of
    proof rests on the claimant and when one of the purposes of questioning
    is to test a claimant's evidence so as to decide whether (to the  lower
    standard) it is credible."

18. I do not  accept  that  the  judge's  approach  was  inconsistent  with
    Mibanga. There was no artificial separation  of  the  medical  evidence
    from the credibility findings. In any event, I find that  only  limited
    support could be gleaned  from  the  medical  evidence  when  assessing
    credibility. I note that whilst the existence of some of the  injuries,
    assessed as diagnostic of healed lacerations to the eyebrows,  and  the
    application of a hot solid object to the skin of the right arm and leg,
    have the potential to  support  the  appellant's  account,  the  report
    itself was rather perfunctory,  and  completed  without  sight  of  the
    reasons for refusal, perhaps  explaining  why  further  questions  were
    posed to the doctor, resulting in the  second  report.  This  explained
    that there was no way to distinguish between falls  and  blows  to  the
    eyebrows. To the extent that the doctor points out that there must have
    been two separate incidents but that the appellant only  recalled  one,
    her account could also be regarded as  inconsistent  with  the  medical
    evidence. Whilst the doctor considered that the 3 scars to the arm  and
    legs were diagnostic of burns. The  doctor  could  only  say  that  the
    pattern was not likely to be accidental but deliberate placement  of  a
    hot object consistent with the appellant's account. At �4 of the second
    report Dr Lord explains that it was not possible to determine  why,  by
    whom, and in what circumstances burns occurred. Dr Lord claims that she
    has considered all other possible causes and  came  to  the  conclusion
    that the overall picture was of someone subjected to ill-treatment,  as
    claimed by the appellant. After considering  these  issues,  the  judge
    stated, "I have therefore given little weight to the report of Dr  Lord
    which only establishes that A1 has injuries,  not  how  those  injuries
    were  inflicted."  In  other  words,  the  medical  evidence  did   not
    particularly assist the first appellant to  demonstrate  that  she  had
    been mistreated by the Sri Lankan authorities as claimed. The judge did
    not state that the injuries did not happen, but on an assessment of the
    evidence she was not satisfied to the lower standard that the  injuries
    were  occasioned  as  claimed.  I  have  to  say  that  even   if   the
    determination had been structured differently, I fail to  see  how  the
    outcome would have been any different, either as to the  factual  claim
    of the second appellant as to involvement in  money  diversion  to  the
    LTTE, or  the  first  appellant's  claim  to  have  been  detained  and
    mistreated because of the second appellant's involvement.

19. It is clear that the First-tier Tribunal Judge took all  of  this  into
    consideration at �47 of the determination. The determination  expressly
    stated that the judge was taking all of the evidence into consideration
    in the round.  At  �47  and  �48  the  judge  drew  attention  to  some
    inadequacies in the medical evidence, noting that the only  description
    of the appellant's ill-treatment was  set  out  at  �11  of  the  first
    report, which did not go into the sort  of  detail  considered  in  KV,
    which made clear that there is no means of distinguishing between scars
    from torture and those by proxy. A careful reading of the determination
    makes it clear that however they were inflicted and  for  what  reason,
    the judge concluded that Dr Lord could not assist in the resolution  of
    that issue. Given that the judge did not  accept  the  account  of  the
    second appellant as to LTTE involvement it follows logically  that  any
    ill-treatment of the first appellant cannot have been at the  hands  of
    the Sri Lankan authorities, there being no other proffered  explanation
    and the burden being on the appellant to demonstrate such. It  is  only
    after that finding that the judge reaches the conclusion at  �49  that,
    to the lower standard of proof, she found that the appellants  are  not
    at risk of persecution on return to Sri Lanka.

20. The judge dealt with the evidence of  Dr  Ghosh  as  to  mental  health
    issues, between �51 and �54 of the determination. It is  arguable  that
    the mental health condition is a product of the mistreatment  and  thus
    is  supportive  of  the  first  appellant's  claim,  but  again  whilst
    potentially consistent with the claimed mistreatment, the judge had  to
    consider the evidence in the round.  Ms  Solanki  complains  that  this
    evidence was not included in the credibility assessment, asserting that
    it was only considered at �26. I do not agree with the submission,  and
    note that it was also considered at�52-54. It is clear from  a  reading
    of the determination that the First-tier Tribunal  Judge,  particularly
    at �52, considered whether the evidence assists in  the  assessment  of
    the  first  appellant's  credibility.  The  judge   pointed   to   some
    deficiencies in Dr Ghosh's report, particularly the failure  to  detail
    current treatment or medication regime, making it difficult  to  assess
    whether the evidence assists the first appellant. At 54 the judge  also
    explained why she did not accept  the  view  of  Dr  Ghosh  as  to  the
    availability of treatment, predicated as it was on a  total  uncritical
    acceptance of the first appellant's account. I do not find it  credible
    that Dr Ghosh can say that she could not be treated in Sri Lanka at all
    even if treatment is available. I note that the report has a very  long
    account of personal history, followed by a relatively short section  on
    present mental state, which begins by noting  that  "given  the  trauma
    that she has suffered," she was remarkably composed. Nowhere  is  there
    any adequate consideration as to whether the symptoms are being feigned
    or exaggerated, or any real treatment of  other  contributing  factors.
    The appellant's account is not challenged in any critical way.  On  the
    whole, the report comes across as  rather  overly  sympathetic  to  the
    appellant rather than as being objective. I also note that  other  than
    the appellants' statements have been  considered,  none  of  the  other
    evidence,  such  as  the  interview  accounts,  have  been  considered.
    Further, it is not unusual, and perhaps  not  unsurprising,  that  many
    asylum  seekers  suffer  from  PTSD,  yet  there   was   no   causation
    consideration of the country background circumstances or of the anxiety
    faced by those having been refused asylum and  seeking  to  remain.  In
    many ways this report left a lot to be desired.

21. In all the circumstances, I find no material error of law in the First-
    tier Tribunal treatment of this report. I am satisfied that on  a  fair
    reading of the determination it is clear that the judge  has  carefully
    considered all the evidence and reached findings in the  light  of  all
    the evidence in the round, including the mental health report.

22. In relation to this report the judge also  found  that  the  article  3
    threshold was not met and  it  is  difficult  to  understand  how  such
    evidence  would  render  removal  an   infringement   of   article   8,
    particularly if treatment is  available  in  the  home  country.  I  am
    satisfied that the judge approached this  evidence  correctly  both  in
    relation to credibility and in relation  to  articles  3  and  8.  When
    weighed in the balance with the findings  in  relation  to  the  second
    appellant's activity, the extent to which the  mental  health  evidence
    supports the first appellant's assertions is  rather  limited.  In  the
    circumstances I find no error of law in this regard.

23. I agree with the judge granting permission to appeal that there was  no
    material error of law in the judge's assessment of article 8. Given the
    factual findings against the appellants, there were no good  compelling
    grounds for consideration of article 8 outside the  Immigration  Rules.
    There was no evidence to suggest that adequate medical treatment  would
    not be available to the first appellant in Sri Lanka. Even if the judge
    had considered article 8 under the Razgar five steps,  I  am  satisfied
    that it would inevitably have resulted in the conclusion  that  on  the
    factual findings of the judge the decision of the  Secretary  of  State
    was entirely proportionate to the appellants'  article  8  private  and
    family life.

24. On a consideration of the determination as a whole,  I  find  that  the
    judge  gave  careful  attention  to  the  evidence,  highlighting   the
    inconsistencies  and  inadequacies,  reaching   findings   which   were
    sustainable on the evidence and for which cogent reasons were given.

Conclusion & Decision

25. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should
    be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeals remain dismissed on all grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No specific submissions were made  on  the  issue.  The
First-tier Tribunal made an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i)  of  the  Asylum
and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I continue the anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: No fee is payable in this case.
