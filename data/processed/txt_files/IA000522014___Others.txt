                                     and

                THE SECETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:          Mr S Whitwell, Senior Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr N Mallick of Counsel


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.      The appellant before the Upper Tribunal is the  Secretary  of  State
   for the Home Department and the respondents are citizens of  India.  They
   are mother father and two children.  However, for the sake of convenience
   I shall refer to the latter as the "appellants" and to the  Secretary  of
   the State as the "respondent", which are the designations they had in the
   proceedings before the First-tier Tribunal.



2.    The appellant's appeal to the  First-tier  Tribunal  was  against  the
   decision of the respondent to refuse their applications to remain in  the
   United Kingdom pursuant to paragraph 276 ADE and under Article 8  of  the
   European Convention on Human Rights.



    3.      A Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal,  P  Telford  allowed  the
       appeals under paragraph 276 ADE for the third appellant and pursuant
       to Article 8 for the other appellants.



    4.      Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
       Cheales who stated that it is arguable that the Judge's finding that
       the third appellant was born in 2005 when his correct date of  birth
       is 1995 was central to the  Judge's  reasoning  and  influenced  his
       decision to allow the appeal.



    5.      At the hearing it was accepted by both parties that the  first-
       tier Tribunal Judge fell into material error when he made a  finding
       of fact that the third appellant was born in 2005.  It  was  further
       accepted that the Judge allowed the third appellant's  appeal  under
       paragraph 276 ADE because he was under the mistaken impression  that
       the third appellant was a minor.





6.      It is a very obvious that a mistake of fact made by  the  first-tier
   Tribunal Judge and I find that there is a material error of  law  in  the
   determination. Consequential to my finding that there is a material error
   of law, I set aside the determination of Judge  preserving  none  of  the
   findings.




   7. Both parties agreed in such an event, the appeal ought to be sent back
      to the First tier- Tribunal so that findings of fact can  be  made.  I
      agreed that this was the proper course  of  action  to  take  in  this
      appeal in accordance with section 7. 2 (b) (i) the Senior  President's
      Practice Statement of 25 September 2012 as we were of  the  view  that
      the appeal requires judicial fact-finding and should to be  considered
      by the First-tier Tribunal.


8. The re-making of the decision on appeal will be undertaken  by  a  First-
   tier Judge in the First-tier Tribunal other than by First-tier Tribunal P
   Telford on a date to be notified.








  Decision




       The case is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for re-determination

A Deputy Judge of the Upper Tribunal
