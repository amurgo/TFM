Representation:

For the Appellant:     Huseyin Yilmaz (Sponsor)
For the Respondent:    Mrs O'Brien, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. Kevser Boz, the Appellant herein,  is  the  spouse  of  Huseyin  Yilmaz
    (hereinafter "the sponsor"). This appeal arises out of a refusal by the
    Entry Clearance Officer, Istanbul ("the ECO") to grant the Appellant an
    entry clearance visa.

 2. The application for the visa was made on 17th  August  2012.   The  ECO
    refusal decision was made on 16th October 2012.   Following  a  request
    for review, the decision was affirmed by the Entry  Clearance  Manager,
    on 10th May 2013.  The ensuing appeal was dismissed by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

 3. Given the course of  the  appeal,  in  which  the  parties'  respective
    representatives  adopted  certain  positions   and   made   appropriate
    representations  to  the  Tribunal,  which  served  to  illuminate  the
    relevant factual matrix, it is unnecessary to delve into  the  minutiae
    of the application or its dual determination.

 4. In order to succeed, the Appellant's application  had  to  satisfy  the
    requirements of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules and, specifically,
    Paragraph EC-P.1.1.  In summary, the rules stipulate that an  applicant
    for entry clearance must provide a  series  of  items  of  information,
    mostly financial in nature.  These relate to matters concerning income,
    savings,  tax  returns  and  national  insurance  contributions.    The
    requirements are both specific and exacting.  The  rules,  inter  alia,
    specify precisely what information is required and the  form  in  which
    this information must be provided.   With  specific  reference  to  the
    application culminating in  this  appeal,  there  are  two  significant
    requirements.  The first is that the Applicant provide "evidence of the
    amount of tax payable, paid and unpaid, for the last  financial  year".
    The second is, in the case  of  a  self  employed  sponsor,  that  "the
    organisation's latest annual  audit  accounts"  be  provided.   In  the
    context of this appeal, it is unnecessary to consider any of the  other
    requirements.

 5. In his representations to the Tribunal, the  sponsor  did  not  dispute
    that the entry clearance application had not  included  either  of  the
    aforementioned types of information.  Thus it was, in effect,  conceded
    that the application was not  compliant  with  the  Rules.   While  the
    sponsor advanced an articulate, credible and reasonable explanation for
    these failures, this, sadly, is of no avail, as it is well settled that
    the requirements of the Rules in such cases are mandatory, admitting of
    no exceptions. There is no "near miss" principle.

 6. The Tribunal  debated  with  Mrs  O'Brien  the  so-called  "flexibility
    policy".  This is the subject of a judgment of the  Upper  Tribunal  in
    Rodriguez (Flexibility Policy) [2013]  UKUT  00042  (IAC),  in  respect
    whereof an application for permission to appeal to the Court of  Appeal
    is pending.  Mrs O'Brien did  not  dispute  that,  in  principle,  this
    policy  applied  to  the  Appellant's  entry   clearance   application.
    Furthermore it was accepted that neither the Appellant nor the  sponsor
    was alerted by the ECO to any deficiencies in the application prior  to
    its  determination.   Thus  no  opportunity  to   address   or   remedy
    shortcomings   was   afforded.    However,    exchanges    with    both
    representatives quickly established that this was of no  moment  since,
    on the two relevant dates, viz (a) the date of the initial ECO decision
    and (b) the date of the Entry Clearance Manager's Review Decision,  the
    sponsor was not in a position to provide the  information  required  by
    the Rules.  Furthermore, the material failures in the application  were
    not matters of mere clarification or expansion.

 7. The Tribunal, naturally, has some sympathy for the  Appellant  and  the
    sponsor.  The Appellant has been  an  active  businessman  in  Northern
    Ireland for some seven years.  He clearly pays his taxes  and  national
    insurance contributions and is contributing to the  local  economy.  He
    has also saved  wisely.   He  is  evidently  an  upright,  law  abiding
    citizen. The sponsor and the Appellant married in Turkey some 2 � years
    ago and, since then, have had a fragmented married life, restricted  to
    his visits to Turkey. One is also mindful of the substantial fee, �900,
    which he paid for the application.  The present appeal illustrates  two
    considerations of central importance in  relation  to  entry  clearance
    visa applications. The  first  is  that  they  must  be  compiled  with
    meticulous care. The second is that  the  applicant  and  sponsor  must
    carefully and wisely select the date when the application is made.   In
    the  present  case,  the  anxiety  to  submit   the   application   for
    determination is understandable.   However,  this,  in  retrospect,  is
    plainly the main reason for its rejection: the application should  have
    been deferred until a little later.

 8. The Tribunal is also bound to comment on two matters pertaining to  the
    ECO's decision.  The first is that neither of the written decisions  is
    expressed with the necessary clarity or in the appropriate detail.  The
    second, based on Mrs O'Brien's  candid  acknowledgement,  is  that  the
    paper  file  compiled  and  maintained  by  the  ECO  was  in  a   most
    unsatisfactory  state.  The  Tribunal  trusts  that  these  significant
    shortcomings will be addressed and rectified in future cases.

 9. Permission to appeal was granted on the basis that an arguable error of
    law existed relating to the  Judge's  comprehension  of  the  financial
    evidence.  No such error of law has been demonstrated.

DECISION

10. The appeal is dismissed and the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  is
    hereby affirmed.
