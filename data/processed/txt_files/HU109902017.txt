                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge McAll, promulgated on 20th June  2018,  following  a  hearing  at
    Manchester on 7th June 2018.  In the determination, the judge dismissed
    the appeal of  the  Appellant,  whereupon  the  Appellant  subsequently
    applied for, and  was  granted,  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.



The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a male, a citizen of China, and was born on 11th  July
    2005.  He appealed against the decision of the Respondent Secretary  of
    State, dated 8th September 2017, refusing his application for leave  to
    enter and remain  in  the  UK,  based  on  his  relationship  with  his
    Sponsors, XC (his mother who was born on 2nd October 1980) and HC  (his
    father who was born on  5th  October  1981).   His  Sponsors  are  also
    citizens of China.  The Respondent, however, was not satisfied that the
    Appellant had met the requirements of the  Immigration  Rules  or  that
    there were any exceptional circumstances that would justify  the  grant
    of entry clearance to the Appellant, for leave to remain outside of the
    Immigration Rules.

The Appellant's Claim

 3. The essence of the Appellant's claim is that  his  sponsoring  parents,
    who came to the UK in 2001 and claimed asylum thereafter on  the  basis
    of being followers of the  Falun  Gong  religion,  had  exercised  sole
    responsibility for him. They could afford to support him.   There  were
    also serious and compelling  circumstances  which  would  lead  to  the
    Appellant's exclusion not being desirable, particularly as  it  was  in
    the Appellant's best interests to be with his parents.

The Judge's Findings

 4. At the hearing before  Judge  McAll,  the  Appellant's  representatives
    submitted that, the Appellant  had  enjoyed  a  family  life  with  his
    parents when he was born, and it was only at the age of 3 to 4  months,
    on account of his suffering from a medical condition, that he was taken
    to China, otherwise he would have remained in the UK, where he had been
    born.  There was medical evidence produced to support these claims.  It
    is true that the Appellant was unable to  apply  to  join  his  parents
    until 2017, but the reason for this was  that  the  sponsoring  parents
    were not settled, and had no discretionary leave  to  remain  here,  so
    that any application made would not  have  succeeded.   The  sponsoring
    parents also needed to demonstrate to the Respondent Secretary of State
    that they had a stable home and established work in the UK before there
    was a likelihood of a successful application.  It was  also  true  that
    the Appellant was being looked after by his grandparents, but they were
    now aging, and they were not in the  best  of  health,  and  there  was
    documentary evidence to this effect.

 5. For his part, the Respondent Secretary of State argued that it was  the
    sponsoring parents' decision in 2005 to be separated from their  child,
    and this is how they have lived, and enjoyed  their  family  life.   In
    fact, there was nothing to prevent the family  reuniting,  should  they
    wish to do so, if the sponsoring parents returned back to China to live
    with  the  Appellant  there.   Alternatively,  the  grandparents  could
    continue to care for the Appellant as they have done  since  2005.   It
    was accepted that this was the first application made for the Appellant
    to come and join his parents in the UK since their separation in  2005,
    and the Appellant was now 12 years of age, but there was  no  necessity
    for the Appellant to come and live in the UK.

 6. In his decision, the judge observed that, given  that  both  sponsoring
    parents were already in the UK, the provisions of  paragraphs  297  and
    301 could not be met, relating to the Appellant joining "a  parent"  in
    the UK.  The judge observed that the argument before him was  that  the
    sponsoring  parents  had  exercised   sole   responsibility   for   the
    Appellant's upbringing and that the grandparents had had no say despite
    the fact that the Appellant had lived with them in China the  whole  of
    his life, a period of over twelve years.  But, the judge held that,  "I
    do not accept that claim" (paragraph 28).

 7. The reason given by the  judge  was  that  the  Appellant's  sponsoring
    mother had given evidence before the judge  that  she  had  decided  to
    separate from her child, when he was just 3 to 4  months  old,  on  the
    basis of advice given to her by her mother that medical  treatment  was
    required, for which the Appellant child was sent to China.   The  judge
    explained that,

         "Once  the  child  arrived  in  China,  however,  decisions   taken
         regarding medical treatment will have been shared between  by  both
         the Sponsors and the grandparents and when a decision needed to  be
         taken  immediately  then  it  would  have   been   taken   by   the
         grandparents.  The Sponsors trusted their family members  in  China
         to make the right decisions and  given  the  separation  and  their
         predicament that would be only natural.  I find  that  they  shared
         decision making" (paragraph 29).

 8. On this basis, the judge went on to conclude that,

         "Deciding the best schooling of the child would not be based solely
         upon what the Sponsors wanted for the Appellant, it  would  clearly
         necessitate them taking into account exactly what the  grandparents
         would and could provide by way of day-to-day care" (paragraph 30).

 9. Furthermore, when the grandmother was asked  in  China  how  often  the
    Appellant saw his mother and father her response was, "the parents  are
    in the UK, they never return to China to meet the child, but they  meet
    online/virtual chat often" (see paragraph 31).

10. As to the suggestion that the grandparents could no longer provide  for
    the Appellant's needs, because the grandmother has been diagnosed  with
    diabetes and late stage uremia, all they had been able to say was  that
    they find it "very hard" to take care of the Appellant, but it was  not
    clear what this exactly meant (paragraph 32).

11. For all these reasons, the appeal was dismissed.

Grounds of Application

12. The grounds of application state that the judge had not considered  the
    evidence with respect to the Appellant's two siblings.  The  judge  had
    found (at paragraph 40) that,

         "Their two children IC and MC are Chinese nationals and whilst they
         have lived in the UK their entire lives they have strong family and
         cultural ties with China.  I am satisfied that they will  adapt  to
         life in their country  of  nationality  given  their  cultural  and
         family ties there should the Appellants return back to China".

13. However, no reason was offered by the judge  for  these  findings.   No
    reference was made  to  the  evidence  provided  in  respect  of  these
    children's lives in the UK.  No account was  taken  of  the  children's
    integration into life in the UK.  IC was born on 16th February 2009 and
    was aged 9 years.  MC was born on 21st December 2011 and  was  aged  6ï¿½
    years.

14. Permission to appeal was granted on 3rd October 2018 on the basis  that
    the judge arguably did not consider where the best interests of IC  and
    MC lay and arguably did not arrive at findings of fact in this respect.
     The Appellant's bundle of documents (at page 87) confirmed that IC was
    aged 9 years and attended All  Saints  Catholic  Primary  School.   The
    judge ought to have considered the remaining children's best  interests
    by first making proper assessment on  those  best  interests  and  then
    considering whether such interests  were  outweighed  by  other  public
    interest considerations.

The Hearing

15. At the hearing before me on 29th November 2018, Mr  Ell,  appearing  on
    behalf of the Appellant,  stated  that  the  judge  had  concluded  (at
    paragraph 40), on the basis of maintaining the  status  quo,  that  the
    decision of the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  was  not  disproportionate.
    However, he had failed to give proper regard to  where  the  other  two
    children were residing, namely, in the  UK.   He  had  failed  to  give
    proper regard to where their best interests lay.  He had failed to note
    that the middle child would now have been in the UK  for  seven  years.
    These matters went to proportionality and affected the outcome in terms
    of the public interest considerations that came into play.

16. For his part, Mr Bates submitted that this was a Leave To  Enter  case.
    The judge had concluded that the status quo could be  maintained.   The
    two children in the UK would remain here, unless they choose  to  leave
    the United Kingdom, in circumstances where the  parents  did  not  have
    settled status.  What they had was discretionary leave to remain  until
    19th March 2021.  The judge did have regard to the  best  interests  of
    the children, when he observed that, "it is almost always in  the  best
    interests of a child to be with their parents" (paragraph 38).

17. What he was stating at paragraph 40 was that it was a matter of  choice
    for the parents, because should they decide to leave the United Kingdom
    then the judge's view was that, "I am satisfied that they  would  adapt
    to life in their country of nationality given their cultural and family
    ties ...".  The children in the United Kingdom were not being  removed.
    Rather, the one remaining child abroad is applying to come into the UK.
     Refusal simply maintains the status quo.

18. In reply, Mr Ell submitted  that  the  plain  fact  remained  that  the
    children's best interests in the UK were not considered by  the  judge.
    It was not feasible for the judge to say that the  three  children  can
    all go and live in China, if the best interests of the two children  in
    the UK, are to remain in this country.

Error of Law

19. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  involved
    the making of an error on a point of law (see  Section  12(1)  of  TCEA
    2007) such that I  should  set  aside  the  decision  and  re-make  the
    decision.  My reasons are as follows.

20. The judge's main conclusions are at paragraph  40.   He  considers  the
    fact that the sponsoring parents have ties in China.  He states, "their
    two children IC and MC are Chinese nationals and whilst they have lived
    in the UK their entire lives they have strong family and cultural  ties
    with China".   There  is  no  consideration,  however,  of  their  best
    interests.

21. The judge simply proceeds to conclude, in relation  to  the  sponsoring
    parents, that, "I am satisfied that they would continue to work hard in
    the UK or in China where they are permitted to remain  and  where  they
    choose to live" (paragraph 40).

22. This is not a case  where  both  sponsoring  parents  in  the  UK  have
    "abdicated" their responsibility for the Appellant child in China.  The
    evidence before the judge was that the  Appellant  child's  grandmother
    had stated that, "the parents are in the UK, they never return to China
    to meet the child,  but  they  meet  online/virtual  chat  often"  (see
    paragraph 31).

23.  In  Nmaju,  the  Court  of  Appeal  stated  that  the  parents'  legal
    responsibility for the child under the appropriate legal  system  would
    be a relevant consideration in deciding sole responsibility.

24. In fact, Pill LJ in NA (Bangladesh and Others)  [2007]  EWCA  Civ  128,
    said that the Tribunal should consider  "as  relevant  the  source  and
    degree of financial support for the child and whether there was  cogent
    evidence of genuine interest in and affection  for  the  child  by  the
    sponsoring parent in the UK" (at paragraph 10).

25. In the instant case, the sponsoring  parents  have  not  been  able  to
    return to China, not because they did not wish  to,  but  because  they
    were not able to.  In Mundeba [2013] UKUT 88,  the  Tribunal  explained
    that the Section 55 consideration has to  be  looked  at  in  terms  of
    whether "there are  unmet  needs  that  should  be  catered  for",  and
    "whether are stable arrangements for the child's physical care".

26. If the grandparents are looking after the  Appellant  child  in  China,
    there must inevitably  come  a  point  in  time  when  they  could  not
    indefinitely do so.

27. The judge did not give proper consideration to this (at paragraph 32).

28. Accordingly, these matters need to be reconsidered again in full by the
    Tribunal below.



Notice of Decision

29. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    on a point of  law.   I  set  aside  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  I re-make the decision as follows.  This appeal is  remitted
    back to the First-tier Tribunal to be determined by a judge other  than
    Judge McAll, pursuant to Practice  Statement  7.2(b)  of  the  Practice
    Directions.

30. An anonymity direction is made.


Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
