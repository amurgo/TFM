For the Respondent:    Mr P Tranter, Home Office Presenting Officer
Interpreter:  Mr E L Saman, Assyrian


Female Christians not at risk of persecution or Article 3 ECHR breach but
additional factors (prominent position in companies associated with Multi-
National Force, westernised, women's rights activities or  refusal to wear
hijab, lack of KDG connections, no family support, English speaking or non-
Kurdish speaking) may increase risk to level engaging both Conventions.  RA
(Christians) Iraq CG [2005] UKIAT 00091 remains correct on position of male
Christians.  No sufficiency of protection outside KDG.



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1. The appellant is an Iraqi national.  This is the reconsideration of her
   appeal.  She is an Assyrian Christian who formerly held a significant
   professional position with the government, negotiating contracts between
   the Iraqi government and Western oil companies.     The appellant's core
   account is consistent with the background evidence regarding the
   situation of Christians in Iraq at the time when she came to the United
   Kingdom.  Her credibility is not disputed; the Secretary of State has
   accepted her account and is no credibility issue under section 8 Asylum
   and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants etc.) Act 2004  as the facts
   relied upon as crystallising the appellant's intention not to return to
   Iraq  arose only after she had reached the United Kingdom; if she is a
   refugee, it is on a sur place basis.

   Facts

2. The appellant  is  a  qualified  chemical  engineer  and  worked  with  a
   chemical engineering company in Iraq as a  Senior  Engineer,  negotiating
   and dealing with Western companies on behalf  of  the  Iraqi  Government,
   using her fluent English.  She is  Westernised  and  does  not  wear  the
   hijab.  She is not Kurdish and has no connections with  the  North.   She
   speaks Assyrian and English, identifying her as Chaldo-Assyrian  and,  in
   relation to the English language, as being likely to have links with  the
   West.  Her case is that this profile puts her  at  risk  as  a  perceived
   collaborator, and that she lacks local protection to allow her to  return
   to Iraq in safety.  She also has family political connections  through  a
   sister,  C, who had a high profile within an organisation which campaigns
   for the rights of women and Assyrians (Beit  Nahrain);  specific  threats
   were made to C, and C's husband was kidnapped just  after  the  appellant
   last came to the United Kingdom.

3.  The appellant has never married, though she had a  relationship  with  a
   man, M, who worked for the  same  company.   M  was  deputy  Director  of
   Petroleum Drilling in the Kirkuk area and a frequent  traveller  to  both
   France and the United States.  They hoped to marry but were not  formally
   engaged. The appellant has two  sisters,  B,  who  lives  in  the  United
   Kingdom, and C, who lived in Iraq.   She has no direct  family  still  in
   Iraq now, although she has a distant cousin, D,  living  in  the  Kurdish
   Regional Government area (KDG).   The  appellant  had  no  personal  past
   history of persecution.

4. Because of her work with Western companies and her refusal  to  wear  the
   hijab, the appellant suffered harassment and bullying at or near her work
   place.  Her employer employed about 600 women of whom 97%  were  prepared
   to wear the hijab.   The  appellant  was  not,  and  this  added  to  her
   visibility as a Christian and caused her difficulties; Muslims constantly
   told her that she was regarded as a Western spy.  She  was  called  names
   and harassed on her way to and from work.  The appellant could cope  with
   that; it is not the reason for her claim.

5. Similarly, she was able to worship at home, but attending Church  outside
   the home was more difficult; she did so only irregularly.  The  appellant
   was often the subject of name-calling when entering or leaving a  Church,
   and there were relatively few Christian churches available  in  which  to
   worship.  Her sister C was involved  with  the  Beit  Nahrain  Party,  an
   organisation concerned with Assyrian people, and also with the rights and
   plight of women in Iraq.

6. The appellant's family travelled to the United  Kingdom  to  visit  B  on
   more than one occasion. On 15 August 2005, the appellant, with C and  her
   family, obtained visit visas for a family visit to B.   The appellant was
   obliged (for business reasons) to return early from the visit, travelling
   via Syria.  On her return, she received a telephone call  from  the  Beit
   Nahrain Party to warn her that Islamic people were trying to locate C and
   threaten her.  They all lived in the same house,  so  the  appellant  was
   worried too.

7. Matters began  to  come  to  a  head  during  October  2005.   While  the
   appellant was at work, three people with guns visited the family home and
   knocked on the door. Her mother had the good sense not to open the  door.
   When she heard of the visit, the appellant felt frightened;  she  decided
   to use her valid visit visa to return to  the  United  Kingdom,  and  re-
   entered the United Kingdom on 26 October 2005.  Her parents  remained  in
   Iraq.  She had at that time no intention to claim asylum, but soon  after
   her arrival, the appellant received bad news,  which  changed  her  mind.
   The appellant learned that on 29 October 2005,  her  friend  M  had  been
   killed in Kirkuk murdered in a hail of bullets in  his  own  home.    M's
   violent death is fully supported by contemporaneous press reports,  which
   name him and are plainly genuine.   Not long after  that,  the  appellant
   learned that C's husband had been kidnapped and disappeared.  There is no
   news of him.

8. On 10 November 2005, the appellant claimed asylum in the United  Kingdom,
   relying  on  her  individual   circumstances   and   upon   the   general
   deterioration in the attitude to Christians in  Iraq.  The  Secretary  of
   State accepts that the circumstances underlying the  appellant's  present
   claim can be treated as having arisen sur place, though he  continues  to
   dispute that they engage the Refugee Convention or the  ECHR.  The  facts
   being agreed and the Secretary of State conceding that return would be to
   Baghdad (but making no general concession on  internal  flight)  we  then
   heard oral submissions from both parties before going on to consider  the
   background evidence as it applies to these facts.

   Appellant's submissions

9. For the appellant, Mr Bandegani reminded us  of  the  provisions  of  the
   Respondent's current Operational  Guidance  Note;  each  case  should  be
   considered on its merits.  He relied upon the expert evidence of Dr  Alan
   George, a freelance writer, journalist  and  consultant  specialising  in
   Middle  Eastern  political  and  economic  affairs,  which  has   written
   extensively on Iraq and prepared some  50  Reports  on  Iraqi  cases  for
   submission to both the IAT and the IAA.

10.  Mr  Bandegani's  argument  was  that  the  cumulative  effect  of   the
   background evidence before the Tribunal on the situation in Iraq, against
   the particular facts of this appellant's case, indicated a real risk or a
   reasonable degree of likelihood of persecution for the present  appellant
   if she were to be returned  now.    The  deterioration  in  circumstances
   because of the general radicalisation of the situation in Iraq  made  the
   situation  more  dangerous  for  Christians,  women,  and   collaborators
   (persons who were prepared to work with the MNF).   This  appellant  fell
   into all three groups.

11. M who had been killed in Kirkuk had a very similar  profile,  save  that
   he was male.  The appellant could not rely on his family to  shelter  her
   if returned, and her own parents were now in  America.   Matters  between
   the appellant and M had not advanced to a point where  his  family  would
   feel any responsibility to take her in.  She could not be expected either
   to begin to wear the  hijab  or  to  desist  from  her  irregular  Church
   attendance.   She was a refugee and entitled to have her case  determined
   as such.

12.  In  relation  to  Article  3  and  internal  relocation,  Mr  Bandegani
   submitted that Batayav v SSHD (No 2) [2005] EWCA Civ 366 (Batayav  No  2)
   erroneously set a higher test for risk on return than  that  required  by
   the 1950 Convention.   We had some difficulty in following this argument,
   which we consider a misunderstanding of the Batayav formulation.  We  are
   assisted by guidance given by the Deputy President of  this  Tribunal  on
   the Batayav No  2  decision,  set  out  in  AA  (Involuntary  returns  to
   Zimbabwe) Zimbabwe CG [2005] UKAIT 00144, at paragraphs 48 and  following
   -

    "51. Sometimes it will be necessary to show a generality of harm.  This
    may be particularly so in cases where a claimant bases his case  simply
    on the characteristics of the country to which he  is  being  returned,
    without referring to the acts of any  malevolent  individual.   If  his
    case is simply based on the awfulness of his country, he  will  clearly
    need to show that the awfulness extends to the whole country, otherwise
    his claim lacks substance:  he fails to  establish  the  risk  of  harm
    because he can avoid it.  If his claim (like Batayav's) is based on the
    conditions in Russian prisons, he needs to establish that  he  will  be
    incarcerated and also that prisons in general pose the risk  he  fears.
    If they do not, he may be unable to show that there is a real risk that
    he will suffer the harm, as his dispatch to one of  the  worse  (rather
    than one of the better) prisons would be a matter of pure  speculation.
    Given that he showed that he was at risk of imprisonment in Russia, his
    case became stronger the more universal  the  conditions  of  which  he
    complains.  But that is not to say that there is an artificial  barrier
    that his evidence has to pass.  It all depends.   It  is  a  matter  of
    logic; and the way the rules of logic work will  differ  from  case  to
    case.

    52.  It is for that reason that we do  not  think  that  the  Court  of
    Appeal intended to set down any  general  rule  in  any  of  the  three
    decisions to which we have referred.   In  each  case,  the  Court  was
    approaching the risk alleged in that case and testing the  evidence  by
    the rules of logic.  It is not surprising that different  words  should
    be used each time; nor is it surprising that in  the  first  Batayav  v
    SSHD all the members  of  the  Court  associated  themselves  with  the
    warning against changing the question by fixing it in a particular form
    of words."

13. We respectfully apply and adopt that analysis  and  approach  Article  3
   based on the language of the Conventions, that is, real risk.  Article  3
   involves an empirical assessment of the conditions which prevail  in  the
   country of origin in order to ascertain whether a particular category  of
   person is at risk, having regard to the scale, frequency and patterns  of
   treatment of that group.  The 'requirement' for a generality of  harm  is
   one of many formulations of that risk,  having  regard  to  the  internal
   relocation question.  An appellant can succeed only by showing  either  a
   general risk, or a particular  risk  for  which  there  is  no  realistic
   internal relocation option which would provide sufficiency of protection.

14. Mr Bandegani submitted that RA (Christians) Iraq CG [2005]  UKIAT  00091
   applied the erroneous test in Batayav No 2 and was unsafe.  That, for the
   reasons set out above, is a bad argument, but the Tribunal will  need  to
   consider whether RA remains  good  law  for  women  in  this  appellant's
   situation, or whether, due either to the changed circumstances in Iraq or
   any of her personal characteristics, this appellant can show a real  risk
   or reasonable degree of likelihood or persecution for her upon return, as
   an English-speaking, non-Kurdish origin  Christian  woman,  with  Western
   professional  connections  ,  a  history  of  Church  attendance  and  an
   objection to wearing the hijab.

   Secretary of State's submissions
15. For the Secretary of State, Mr Tranter relied on the letter  of  refusal
   and argued that until the end of October 2005, the appellant's  case  was
   one of discrimination but not persecution; when she  entered  the  United
   Kingdom for the second time on 26 October 2005, she  did  not  intend  to
   claim asylum.  Nothing persecutory had ever happened to her and she could
   have no reasonable  subjective  fear  (a  species  of  reverse  Demirkaya
   argument).  The harassment and name-calling relied upon by  Mr  Bandegani
   predated her arrival in October 2005 and  had  not  caused  her  to  seek
   asylum.

16. The appellant was if anything a refugee sur place relying on the  murder
   of M and the disappearance of C's husband.  Her fears should be  confined
   to events which naturally flowed from those two events and nothing  more.
   She needed to show a significant change since the Tribunal's most  recent
   country guidance decision in RA and she had not done so.   Discrimination
   had not become persecution; M's death did not put her at  risk.   In  her
   first witness statement at paragraph  15,  the  appellant  described  M's
   death as murder by 'unknown people'. Mr  Tranter  accepted  that  it  was
   reasonably likely on the background evidence that M was shot dead because
   of his association with America. However, although he worked for the same
   employer, he worked in an entirely different part of the country and  the
   link to the appellant was tenuous.

17. In relation  to  the  disappearance  of  C's  husband,  the  appellant's
   evidence was vague.  No reason for the kidnapping had been given.  It was
   not all at clear why he had disappeared or whether his disappearance  was
   linked to C's involvement in Beit Nahrain.  Nevertheless,  the  Secretary
   of State accepted the fact of this disappearance, having  regard  to  the
   lower standard appropriate for these Conventions.

18. In his submission, in order to succeed the appellant would need to  show
   persecutory general country conditions.  She had a highly paid job before
   coming to the United Kingdom with a successful position and had not  been
   targeted. Of the 600,000 remaining Assyrian Christians in Iraq, it  could
   reasonably be assumed that 300,000 of them were female.  He accepted that
   the appellant had been working with contracts with Western companies, but
   the evidence did not show her to be at risk on that account.   There  was
   no significant change in the country evidence since RA; in that case, the
   Tribunal did consider the evidence of the bombings, murders and incidents
   the subject of the present submissions and nothing new or more cogent was
   before the Tribunal.   There was therefore no general risk  and  no  real
   evidence of personal risk to a single  Christian  woman.   He  asked  the
   Tribunal to dismiss the appeal.

   Appellant's reply to Secretary of State's submissions
19. In reply, Mr Bandegani relied upon the interview record for  details  of
   the  harassment  the  appellant  had  suffered  in  Iraq;  she  had  been
   threatened and felt intimidated.  Her appeal was not predicated  just  on
   the evidence relating to  M's  husband  although  that  was  certainly  a
   significant component in the risk  to  her  now.   As  indicated  in  the
   Tribunal's starred determination in Gomez (Non-state actors: Acero-Garces
   disapproved)  (Colombia)  [2000]  UKIAT   00007*,   mixed   motives   for
   persecution or Article 3 ill-treatment were permissible.

20. He had presented evidence which was  not  before  the  Tribunal  in  RA,
   particularly the UNHCR evidence.   He  argued  that  there  was  a  clear
   deterioration in the position of Christians in Iraq because of  increased
   fundamentalism and targeting of people like this  appellant.   The  facts
   here were very different since the appellants in RA and  in  AK  (Iraq  -
   Christians - Risk) Iraq CG [2004] UKIAT 00298 were both men  with  family
   members to assist them in re-settling in Iraq.   Taken together, the risk
   factors amounted to a cumulative risk at  a  level  which  the  appellant
   could not be expected to accept, particularly as she had no family  still
   in Iraq to protect her.

21. The Respondent in his Operational Guidance Note accepted that there  was
   no sufficiency of protection available, at least in central Iraq, and the
   evidence relating to the KRG area before this Tribunal was more  detailed
   than that in paragraph 73 of RA.  The  US  State  Department  Report  was
   neutral to the Secretary of State's  case  and  should  be  treated  with
   caution since the United States was the leading country involved  in  the
   Multi-National Force (the MNF), which Iraqis  regarded  as  an  occupying
   force.   There was no  tangible  improvement  despite  many  governmental
   statements of intention.

22. Demirkaya was not determinative  of  this  appeal;  where  an  appellant
   could show a  future risk it was not necessary to show past  persecution;
   a 'last  straw'  could  make  return  impossible  for  an  appellant  who
   previously had been able to put up with considerable discrimination while
   remaining  in  the  country  of  origin.   Individuals  had  motives  for
   remaining  in  their  countries  of  origin  even  under  very  difficult
   conditions.  He reminded the Tribunal that except for the distant  cousin
   in Kirkuk, every other occupant of the family house in Baghdad  had  fled
   Iraq and was now living abroad.  There was no family network to which she
   could return.

23. The usefulness of the existing country guidance  cases  in  this  appeal
   was limited as they related to men and had not considered in  any  detail
   the position of women, or offences against  Islamic  mores.    There  was
   further and better evidence before the Tribunal.  He asked  the  Tribunal
   again to allow the appeal.

   Discussion
24. After a short  discussion  in  chambers,  we  indicated  that  we  would
   reserve our determination.   We clarified with Mr Bandegani that  he  was
   not seeking to rely upon Article 8 ECHR, and having received confirmation
   of that, we consider only Article 3 of the 1950 Convention, and the  1951
   Convention.


   The authorities
25. Before 2004, it was clear that Christians in Iraq were not a  persecuted
   group.  However, there has been a steady deterioration of the position of
   Christians reflected in  AK   and  RA,  both  of  which  relate  to  male
   Christians, and which stop just short of finding persecutory  conditions.
   In AK, the Tribunal applied the  threshold  as  set  out  in  Hariri  and
   Batayav involving the need to show gross and systematic persecution.  The
   Tribunal accepted that -
    "10. There are clearly problems at least towards particular  Christians
          in Iraq, some of which may cross the threshold of persecution  or
          Article 3....,  sellers  of  alcohol,  owners  of  cinemas  where
          sexually explicit films are shown, and perhaps people  who  speak
          English on account of their Christianity are at particular  risk.
           There may be a degree of risk also to women wearing  headscarves
          although the evidence seems to suggest that they would be  likely
          to risk no more than having eggs or tomatoes thrown at them".


   The Tribunal considered in that case that the appellant  (who  was  male)
   had not demonstrated a real risk of persecution.

26. The second case, RA, is the most recent country guidance  authority  and
   is based on evidence put before the Tribunal  on  13  January  2005,  the
   determination having been notified on 22 April 2005.   In that  decision,
   again dealing with a man, at  paragraph  70-76,  the  Tribunal  found  as
   follows:

    "70. There is clearly therefore evidence of  significant  problems  for
          Christians in a number of parts of Iraq.  Most  of  the  evidence
          concerns Chaldo-Assyrians, but  we  consider  that  the  risk  to
          Christians generally is not materially different from the risk to
          Chaldo-Assyrians and the issue is of that of assessing the  level
          of risk that they face, and in particular as the  Tribunal  noted
          in AK, following Hariri and  Batayav,  there  requires  to  be  a
          consistent pattern of gross and systematic  violation  of  rights
          under Article 3 for that threshold to be crossed.


    71.  We accept that the evidence shows a deterioration in the situation
         since the Tribunal considered the evidence of risk to Christians in
         Iraq in AK.   It  is  relevant  to  bear  in  mind  also,  evidence
         summarised in the Country Report of October 2004 that  the  Foreign
         and  Commonwealth  Office  is  receiving   increased   Reports   of
         intimidation against Christians.  There have  also  been  sectarian
         attacks and  over  recent  months,  Christian  churches  have  been
         deliberately targeted in bomb attacks which have  resulted  in  the
         deaths of eleven people.  The Chaldean Patriarch  has  stated  that
         fanaticism is on the rise, but he  considered  that  there  was  no
         general persecution of Christians.  He considered that the personal
         survival of Christians is likely to come under further  threats  as
         the movement for the Islamisation of Iraq gathers momentum.


    72.  The question before us is whether there is a real risk  on  return
         for this appellant and to what extent if any there can be  said  to
         be a real risk for Christians generally in Iraq. Increasing numbers
         of Christians are leaving Iraq, though equally  it  is  clear  that
         significant numbers remain. The number of Christians in Iraq  would
         appear on the evidence as a whole (and in this regard  we  consider
         that the recent Report in the Daily Telegraph is somewhat in  error
         in this respect) to be in the order of some  600,000.  It  is  said
         that at one point there were over a million prior to  the  downfall
         of Saddam Hussein's r�gime. The number of examples to which we have
         referred above  in  the  evidence  persuades  us  and  the  general
         atmosphere of fear that the situation is closer than it was to  one
         where there is a real risk of persecution or breach of their  human
         rights for Christians in Iraq. We are not persuaded, however,  that
         it has reached the point of crossing the threshold to become a real
         risk. It is clear that Christians are still  meeting  together  and
         attending church, albeit in an atmosphere  of  increasing  concern,
         and  increasing  examples  of  attacks  and  are  clearly   feeling
         inhibited from expressing their religion to  an  extent  which,  we
         accept, comes closer than previously to amounting to a real risk of
         persecution. However we conclude that the evidence falls  short  as
         of today of indicating that the appropriate threshold is crossed.

    73.  ... The evidence is not such at this stage as to indicate problems
         for a person relocating to the North such as to render this  unduly
         harsh or, in the case of Article 3 of the Human  Rights  Convention
         to indicate a  real  risk  of  breach  of  their  human  rights  in
         effecting such relocation and living in the North.


    74.  We are conscious of the fact that Iraq is a country  where  change
         occurs at a faster rate than in most other countries of the  world.
         Country Guidance cases on Iraq at present are unlikely  to  have  a
         very long shelf life.  Nevertheless  we  can  only  deal  with  the
         evidence as it is before us at the time of the hearing, and we have
         concluded with regard to the evidence on risk to Christians in Iraq
         that at present though the position has, as  we  say,  deteriorated
         since it was examined by the Tribunal in AK, that it  does  not  in
         the case of a Christian such as the appellant who has no particular
         distinguishing features to his Christianity, give risk  to  a  real
         risk.  Again, the categories identified by the Tribunal  in  AK  at
         paragraph 10 would appear to be at particular risk..."


27. It is clear from that reasoning that the Tribunal  in  April  2005  came
   very close to considering that there  was  a  persecutory  risk  to  male
   Christians in Iraq.  The appeal in RA was dismissed in part based upon an
   internal relocation option for the appellant, but principally because the
   country evidence fell below the  standard  of  real  risk  or  reasonable
   degree of likelihood.  The Batayav argument is  misplaced;  it  is  clear
   from paragraph 72 that the Tribunal did apply the real risk test and  the
   argument that a higher standard has been applied is factually  wrong.  We
   refer to our consideration of the Batayav No 2 point above; the  argument
   is also legally erroneous.

   Background Evidence
28. We next considered the updated background evidence on  the  position  in
   Iraq for Christians, and perceived collaborators.  We have the  advantage
   of a substantial bundle of evidence amounting to  almost  700  pages,  of
   which 494 pages constitute the  appellant's  bundle,  together  with  the
   Respondent's Operational Guidance Note, the COI Report for  October  2005
   and the US State Department Report.  We shall consider  the  Respondent's
   evidence first.

   The Country of Origin Information Report for October 2005
29. We began by considering the Respondent's position  as  set  out  in  the
   October 2005  Country  of  Origin  Information  Report  and  the  current
   Operational Guidance Note.

   Political and geographical background in Iraq
30. The Country of Origin Information report summarises a  number  of  other
   international reports and we  set  out  the  summary  points  from  those
   reports where relevant.  The Report  contains  a  helpful  chronology  of
   major events, so we first reminded ourselves of the events there set  out
   which post-date the evidence before the Tribunal for RA, which considered
   material up to and including January 2005:

       . 30 January 2005.  The multi party national elections were held in
         Iraq.  The Shi'a United Iraqi Alliance (UIA) wins with 49% of the
         votes cast and 140 seats in the 275 seat National Assembly.   The
         Kurdistan Alliance list led by Jalal Talebani obtains 26% of the
         vote and 75 seats in the National Assembly.  Al-Qaimah al-Iraqiyah
         (Iraqi List) led by the interim Prime Minister Ayad Allawi, was in
         third place with 14 per cent and 40 seats.
       . 28 February 2005. More than 130 are killed by a massive car bomb in
         Hiller South of Baghdad in the worst single such incident since the
         US led invasion.
       . April 2005.  Parliament selects Kurdish leader  Jalal  Talebani  as
         President Ibrahim Jaafari, a Shi'ite becomes  Prime  Minster.   The
         formation of a now government comes amid  escalating  violence.   A
         new Council of Ministers is approved by the TNA on 28 April 2005.
       . May 2005.  The Iraqi government announces  a  huge  anti-insurgency
         operation in Baghdad with  40,000  troops  being  deployed  on  the
         streets over the next week to stop the  attacks  that  have  killed
         more than 650 people in April 2005.
       . June 2005.  Masoud Barzani is sworn as regional President in  Iraqi
         Kurdistan.
       . July 2005.  A study compiled  by  the  United  Kingdom  based  non-
         governmental Iraq Body Count  Organisation  estimated  that  almost
         25,000 civilians died in Iraq in the war so far (between  20  March
         2003 and 19 March 2005).
       . August 2005-Draft constitution is endorsed  by  Shi'a  and  Kurdish
         negotiators but not by Sunni representatives.
       . September 2005- As many as 1,000 people are feared dead following a
         stampede during a Shi'a religious ceremony in Baghdad."


31.  The  Country  of  Origin  Information  Report  contains  the  following
   geographical and political  statistics.   The  Republic  of  Iraq  has  a
   population of 25,175,000 (growing at just under 3% a year) of whom almost
   75% live in the flat alluvial plane stretching South-East towards Baghdad
   and Basra to the Persian Gulf.  75% to 80% of the population are Arab and
   15% to 20% are Kurdish.   The number of Assyrians is tiny and the  number
   of minority religion adherents in total  is  approximately  3%  including
   Christian and other religions (Section 2 of the Report).

   Christians
32. There are estimated  (paragraph  6.138)  to  be  700,000  Christians  of
   various denominations in Iraq, of whom 30% live in the  North,  with  the
   rest mostly in Baghdad and a few  in  Basra.   The  US  State  Department
   Report on Religious Freedom  notes  that  Assyrians  and  Christians  are
   considered by many to be distinct.   The majority  of  Iraq's  Christians
   are Chaldo-Assyrians.  Assyrians and Chaldeans  are  considered  distinct
   ethnic groups, descended from some of the early Christian communities and
   indeed from the earliest  occupiers  of  the  land  now  known  as  Iraq.
   Paragraph 6.141 records that Assyrians are integrated but keeping  a  low
   profile.  In Baghdad and Kirkuk, they are neutral and  at  October  2004,
   held a respected and valued place in society.  Christians  could  not  be
   considered as a persecuted group in October 2004.

33. At paragraph 6.143, the Report  deals  with  the  Freedom  House  Report
   2005, which recorded  targeting  of  Iraqi  Christians  with  5%  of  the
   community leaving the country by year's end  of  2004.   Paragraph  6.144
   records a UNHCR Report of 2004, noting a dramatic  deterioration  in  the
   position of Christians. By December 2004,  paragraph  6.147,  the  Report
   considered that the situation of Christians  in  Iraq  had  improved,  at
   least in legislative terms.

34. At paragraph 6.150, the report sets out an excerpt from  a  letter  from
   the Foreign and Commonwealth Office of 20 January 2005, as follows:

         "But Iraqi Christians do face a growing sectarian threat. While we
         are not aware of any officially sponsored discrimination against
         Christian communities in Iraq, reports of attacks on them are on
         the increase. ... We [FCO] see increasing evidence of sectarian
         intimidation. Recent examples include threatening notes pushed
         through doors, death threats to priests and church leaders, posters
         in the North warning Christians to convert to Islam or leave Iraq
         or face death and destruction of homes and Islamist websites
         calling for attacks on all infidels in Iraq. Iraqi Christians are
         feeling increasingly beleaguered. Church attendance is falling and
         some families are keeping their children away from school."


35. The same letter is quoted at paragraph 6.153, together with  an  extract
   from another Foreign and Commonwealth  Office  letter  dated  25  January
   2005:

     "Christians are relocating to Suleimaniya, Arbil  and  Dohuk  provinces
        only. ... Many of the Christians in Basra  and  Baghdad  originally
        came from the North  (Suleimaniya,  Arbil  and  Dohuk  as  well  as
        Mosul). Under a separate  scheme  run  by  the  Kurdistan  Regional
        Governments, around 150 families have  relocated  from  Baghdad  to
        Faysh Habur."

36. The US State Department Report for 2004 stated  that  according  to  the
   Christian Endowment Office, more than 30,000 Christian families had  fled
   the country during 2004  and  an  article  from  the  Guardian  newspaper
   supported this on 2 August 2004.

   Chaldo-Assyrians
37.  The section of the report dealing with Assyrians and Chaldeans  appears
   at paragraph 6.228 and simply  reflects  their  different  ethnicity  and
   language.  Chaldo-Assyrians do not define themselves as Arabs.

   Women
38. The position of women is considered at paragraph  6.229:

         "6.229   As stated in a DFID Report, dated July 2005, "Historically
              Iraq has had one of the best gender equality records  in  the
              Middle East, with women playing an active and visible role in
              political and economic  life.  ...  Yet  years  of  conflict,
              isolation  from   the   international   community,   economic
              mismanagement and brutal government have had a very  negative
              impact on Iraqi women. Women now  suffer  multiple  forms  of
              deprivation - social, economic and political.""

39. At paragraphs 6.240-6.242, the Report sets out concerns expressed  by  a
   number of international sources in 2005, as  to  pressure  on  women  and
   girls to wear a headscarf or veil (the hijab) and attacks  on  them  when
   they  were  not  so  dressed.   At  paragraphs  6.270-6.271,  the  Report
   considers the position of single women such as  this appellant -

         "6.270   As mentioned in the  British/Danish  fact-finding  mission
              report,  October  2004,   "Sources   in   the   Ministry   of
              Displacement and Migration (MoDM)  in  Baghdad  informed  the
              delegation that single women returning to  Iraq  from  abroad
              were in  a  less  favourable  position  compared  with  women
              travelling with their family."
         6.271    The same report noted that  "UNHCR  in  Amman  noted  that
              single women have a more vulnerable situation.  Families  can
              protect them, however tribes can target them just  as  easily
              as they can protect them."

   Collaborators and the MNF (Multi-National Force)
40. At paragraphs 6.323-6.329, in  particular  at  6.325  ff.,   the  Report
   stated:

         "6.325   The UNHCR in a  Return  Advisory,  dated  September  2004,
              noted that:


              "While most security incidents prior to the handover directly
              targeted soldiers and or nationals of countries participating
              in the Coalition Forces, threats and attacks over the past
              six months have been increasingly aimed at Iraqi civilians
              employed by the UN, NGOs and foreign contractors as well as
              foreign nationals who work for any of the above. Furthermore,
              Iraqi intellectuals, medical staff, doctors, journalists,
              artists, as well as anyone associated with or perceived as
              supporting the new Interim Iraqi Government (IIG) have also
              become frequent targets of both harassment and violence.
              Members of the Iraqi police force, as well as potential
              police recruits are often the victims of lethal attacks."


         6.326    The AI report, dated 25 July 2005, added that "Hundreds of
              Iraqis have been killed by armed  groups  because  they  were
              perceived as 'traitors' or 'collaborators'. Among  them  have
              been translators, drivers and other civilians working for the
              MNF,  civil  servants,  government  officials,   judges   and
              journalists. The  attacks  have  sometimes  resulted  in  the
              killing  of  people  accompanying  the  'targets,'  including
              children."


         6.327    The same report also noted  that  "The  armed  groups  are
              resentful of Kurds and Shi'as for generally having  supported
              the military intervention in Iraq and  for  cooperating  with
              the MNF."

         6.328    The AI report, dated 25 July 2005, however, noted that "On
              26 September 2004, the  IAMS  [International  Association  of
              Muslim Scholars] denounced  the  kidnapping  and  killing  of
              civilians." [28c] (p7)

         6.329    Furthermore, the  IWPR  article,  dated  10  August  2004,
              observed that  an  unofficial  Islamic  court  imposes  harsh
              sentences on Iraqis who work  for  the  Americans  and  their
              allies. The report stated that "An 'Islamic resistance' court
              based in Western Iraq has begun to  order  harsh  punishments
              against  Iraqis  accused  of  collaborating  with   so-called
              foreign occupiers, inhabitants in the region said.""


41. Paragraphs 6.334-6.348 set out  the  difficulties  engendered  by  large
   movements of internally displaced persons.  Kidnapping and hostage-taking
   are dealt with at paragraphs 6.382-6.390.

   OGN January 2006
42. The next document from the Secretary of State is the OGN  issued  on  12
   January 2006 and this was relied on by both representatives.  The  Report
   sets out the difficulties for Christians (paragraph 3.16 on page  351  of
   the main bundle).  It distinguishes (paragraph 3.16.2)  between  Assyrian
   Christians who originate from the KRG area in Northern Iraq, who  can  be
   expected to return and live there, and those who originate  from  Baghdad
   and Basra in the South.  The OGN accepts that there is  insufficiency  of
   protection, other than in the KRG.  It accepts that attacks on Christians
   are increasing and attendance at Church  becoming  very  difficult,  with
   numbers falling sharply.  The passage on sufficiency of protection is  at
   paragraph 3.16.4 -


         "3.16.4  Sufficiency of Protection Iraq's council, interim, and
         elected Government have all been determined to clamp down on
         terrorism and insurgency. [5.93]However, the rule of law,
         guarantees of personal security, and protection from human rights
         abuses vary from location to location. The massive deployment of
         Iraqi police has won support from many Iraqis, who lived in fear of
         both bombers and common criminals.


         3.16.4   Law and order exists in the Kurdistan Regional Government
         administered area. Kurdish police and security forces are efficient
         and the security situation in the self-ruled Kurdish region is
         significantly different from that in the rest of Iraq. Although it
         is quite likely that insurgents living in Kurdish towns and cities
         would use opportunities as they present themselves to exact
         revenge, the peshmerga presence and vigilance within the KRG area
         would make this difficult.  Successful attacks are rare, primarily
         due to the vigilance of the Kurdish security forces.  Criminality
         in the KRG area is endemic by Western terms.  However, much of the
         activity is considered by the Iraqi population to be simply a way
         of earning a living.


         3.16.5    Sufficiency of protection in central and Southern Iraq is
         not currently at a reasonable level, however in the Kurdistan
         Regional Government area it can be argued that protection is at a
         reasonably effective level.




43. The question of internal relocation is dealt with  at  paragraph  3.16.6
   and following -

         "3.16.6 Internal Relocation There is freedom of movement in that
         there are no formal restrictions within Iraq however there are
         limitations due to the numerous military and illegal checkpoints.
         Moreover at the Green Line (the border to the Kurdistan Regional
         Government area) there is restriction of movement into the three
         Northern Governorates. Certain cities limit particular ethnic
         groups; however, Baghdad is accessible for resettlement. The
         Kurdish area is much more stable than the rest of the country; it
         is easy to move around. Arab Iraqis are instantly recognised by
         Iraqi Kurds who view them with suspicion and would not generally
         welcome them into the KRG area.
         3.16.7   Generally there is freedom of movement throughout Iraq; it
         is unlikely that internal relocation would be unduly harsh for men,
         and women with male partners or relatives. As a result of the
         recent rise in Islamic extremism, single women may be unable to
         move around freely if unaccompanied and may not be able to settle
         in areas where they have no family ties, as they are unlikely to be
         able to access resources without support. In assessing this,
         caseworkers will need to take all relevant factors into account
         including financial circumstances, health, whether the claimant has
         a support network.
         3.16.8   Christians in Mosul number around 100,000 and make up the
         largest Christian community in the North, however they have been
         targeted in this area. Numbering only 10,000 and only 2% of the
         local population, Christians in Kirkuk fare much better and are
         well respected by all sides. The Christian community in Basra in
         the South is small and under much less threat than those in the
         North. Many Christians, around 1,000 families so far, are
         relocating back to Sulaimaniyah under a scheme, which provides them
         with land, housing and jobs. In turn, they will provide skills and
         investment into the area. It is not considered unduly harsh for
         Christians to relocate to areas where there are numerous other
         Christians, or where they are well respected."

44. The guidance given to the  Secretary  of  State's  case  workers  is  at
   3.16.10:

         "3.16.10 Conclusion a claimant who has a localised threat on the
         basis that they are a Christian and is unable to acquire protection
         in their local area, may be able to relocate to an area where that
         localised threat does not exist. The caseworker will need to take
         into consideration the nature of the threat and how far it would
         extend to, and whether it would be unduly harsh to expect the
         claimant to relocate. In the absence of an internal relocation
         argument a claim made on these grounds may be well founded and a
         grant of refugee status may be appropriate."          [Emphasis
         added]

45. Guidance on fear of Islamic militants is at paragraph 3.17.10:

         "3.17.8  Conclusion a general fear of Islamic Militants does not of
         itself give rise to a well-founded fear of persecution, and no
         government can be expected to guarantee the safety of all its
         citizens. However, there will be individuals whose fear is over and
         above the common population because of aspects of their nature that
         they cannot or should not be expected to change. This assessment
         will need to be taken based on the merits of the individual case.
         Moreover, the caseworker will need to take into consideration the
         nature of the threat and how far it would extend to, and whether it
         would be unduly harsh to expect the claimant to relocate. For
         claimants who can demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution by
         Islamic extremists due to a Convention reason (e.g. their religion
         or their political opinion, imputed or otherwise) [and who] are
         unable to acquire protection or relocate internally a grant of
         asylum will be appropriate."

46. The section on perceived collaborators is at 3.8 and the  conclusion  is
   in similar terms, accepting the evidence of the risk to those working for
   the MNF and people accompanying them.


   Evidence from the US State Department
47. We then considered the US State Department  evidence,  bearing  in  mind
   the reservations expressed by Mr Bandegani.   The Report,  which  appears
   in the bundle  at  pages  146-160,  relates  to  the  period  before  the
   elections, and is, to that extent,  out  of  date.  We  have  accordingly
   referred to the current Report, which was  not  in  our  bundle  but  was
   issued on 8 March 2006 and existed before the date of  our  hearing.   It
   records the following human rights problems:

        1. Pervasive climate of violence
        1. Misappropriation of official authority by sectarian,  terrorist,
           and insurgent groups
        2. Arbitrary deprivation of life
        3. Disappearances
        4. Torture and other cruel,  inhuman,  or  degrading  treatment  or
           punishment
        5. Impunity
        6. Poor conditions in pre-trial detention facilities
        7. Arbitrary arrest and detention
        8. Denial of fair public trial
        9. An immature judicial system lacking capacity
       10.  Limitations  on  freedoms  of  speech,  press,  assembly,   and
           association due to terrorist and militia  violence  restrictions
           on religious freedom
       11. Large number of internally displaced persons (IDPs)
       12. Lack of transparency and widespread corruption at all levels  of
           government
       13. Constraints on nongovernmental organizations (NGOs)
       14. Discrimination against women, ethnic and religious minorities

48. That is a  chilling  list,  especially  given  the  perspective  of  the
   American-led MNF and its r�le in the region.   The  US  State  Department
   Report records that
         "Civic life and the social fabric  remained  under  intense  strain
         from the insurgency, as well as from a continuing shortage of basic
         services and staples. Despite this pressure, the IIG  in  6  months
         set and kept to a legal and electoral course based on  respect  for
         political rights. This  included  most  importantly  the  right  of
         citizens to change peacefully their government through  nationwide,
         free, and  fair  elections.  The  development  of  a  Human  Rights
         Ministry, the ongoing  empowerment  of  women,  and  the  explosive
         growth  of   nongovernmental   organizations   (NGOs)   and   civic
         associations reflected a governmental commitment to  human  rights.
         The Government's success in building an accommodating structure for
         the exercise of civil liberties, although burdened by the  heritage
         of dictatorship and disregard for law, was  shown  clearly  in  the
         citizens'  embrace  of  freedoms  of  speech  and  press,  peaceful
         assembly, and association and religion. While major problems  still
         remained, they were of a far different magnitude  and  nature  than
         previously."
49. Under Freedom of Religion the Report stated:

     "The  [transitional  legislation]  provides  for  freedom  of  thought,
        conscience and religious belief and practice.  While the government
        endorsed these rights, its efforts to prevent or remedy  violations
        were hampered by substantial  politically  and  religiously  driven
        violence between Sunni and Shi'a [and] by harassment of Christians.
         Deficiencies in security force capabilities and in the rule of law
        made it difficult for the justice system to investigate or  address
        violations of these rights.  ...   Government leaders  spoke  often
        of the need for all  citizens  to  unite  regardless  of  religious
        orientation in the face  of  terrorism  and  repeatedly  emphasised
        their  commitment  to  equal  treatment  for  all   religions   and
        ethnicities...

        According to a number of estimates the Christians  in  the  country
        decreased from 1.4 million in 1987 to approximately 750,000  during
        the year with Catholics  comprising  the  majority.   According  to
        church leaders in Arbil and Mosul Christians in the  North  account
        for roughly 30% of the country's Christian  population.   Christian
        religious leaders estimate approximately 750,000  Iraqi  Christians
        live abroad.  The  on-going  insurgency  significantly  harmed  the
        ability of all religions to practice their faith...

        There were allegations  that  the  KRG  engaged  in  discriminatory
        behaviour against religious minorities... Assyrian Christians  also
        allege that the KDP  dominated  judiciary  routinely  discriminated
        against non-Muslims and legal judgments in their  favour  were  not
        enforced...

        During the year members of Catholic, Assyrian and Armenian orthodox
        churches as well as clerics left Shi'a-dominated Basra  because  of
        religious and social economic discrimination and  because  of  fear
        for  their  lives  due  to  the  unstable  security  situation  for
        Christians.  Extremists, including  terrorist  groups  and  militia
        members  targeted  many  individuals  because  of  their  religious
        orientation and very  conservative  elements  of  society  targeted
        others because of their secular leanings.   Many also were  victims
        of general  lawlessness  that  permitted  insurgents  and  criminal
        gangs, as well as those in police  uniform  to  victimise  citizens
        with impunity.   In addition to kidnapping,  individuals  were  the
        victims of harassment intimidation and murder.  Some Christians  in
        Basra Reportedly  were  faced  to  pay  for  protection  for  their
        personal welfare.


         Women and girls were reportedly often threatened  for  not  wearing
         the traditional headscarf (hijab), assaulted  with  acid  for  non-
         compliance and sometimes killed for refusing to cover  their  heads
         or for wearing Western style clothing.  Some women were  reportedly
         denied employment and educational opportunity because they were non-
         Muslim or did not present themselves as sufficiently  conservative.
         "[Emphasis added]

50. In the section on internally  displaced  persons,  the  Report  reflects
   that the vast majority of IDPs were non-Arabs, including Chaldo-Assyrians
   forcibly  relocated  further  South  as  part  of  the  Saddam   r�gime's
   Arabisation  process.   The  Ministry  for  Displacement  and   Migration
   continued support for a ban on the forced return of Iraqi citizens to the
   country from abroad due to poor security conditions and inadequate social
   infrastructure.  Six Chaldo-Assyrians had been elected to the government.
    However, women leaders claimed that

    "Some extremist groups targeted women  by  kidnapping  and  terrorising
    them in an effort to force them to refrain from working in  public  and
    remain  at  home,  wear  veils,  and  adhere  to  a  very  conservative
    interpretation of Islam. "

51. According to a February 2006 Amnesty  International  Report,  women  and
   girls fear abduction, rape, killing, and the lack of security remained  a
   serious threat.  Two to three women were  murdered  each  week  in  Basra
   where banners were frequently seen which threatened  women  who  did  not
   wear the hijab.  It was widely believed  that  many  of  the  women  died
   because they were not wearing the hijab, including some  women  who  were
   targeted and taken from their homes and killed.  In October, for example,
   three young women were fatally shot in the head  and  their  bodies  left
   near the University.

52. Under national, racial and ethnic minorities  the  report  records  that
   Kurdish authorities discriminated against Christians in  the  North.   In
   its 2005 Report to Congress on International Religious  Freedom,  the  US
   Department of State reinforces the statements already considered in  this
   decision.

   Dr Alan George's expert report
53. The appellant supports her claim with a report  from  Dr  George.    His
   expert report is directed at setting the appellant's account in  context.
   Much of the information summarised in the  Report  is  available  in  its
   original form in the bundle  before  us,  or  pre-dates  the  April  2005
   promulgation of the decision in RA.  The only part of this  Report  which
   is later than that appears at paragraph 54:

         "54.     As recently as September 2005 the entire  lay  leadership
          of the Anglican Church in Iraq went missing and were feared  dead
          after being attacked while returning  by  road  from  a  trip  to
          Jordan  although  it  would  appear  they   were   not   targeted
          specifically because they were Christians."


54.   Dr  George  emphasises  that  Christians  are  widely   perceived   as
   collaborators and it is this combination of religious risk and  political
   opinion and perception  which  is  the  most  dangerous  feature  of  the
   appellant's position.


   UNHCR guidelines October 2005
55. We also have the  benefit  of  the  UNHCR  Guidelines  relating  to  the
   eligibility of Iraqi  asylum  seekers  issued  in  October  2005.   UNHCR
   Guidelines are of enormous help to the Tribunal,  although,  given  their
   differential purpose, they can rarely  be  determinative  of  the  issues
   before the Tribunal.  They are nevertheless a clear record of information
   obtained from a unique perspective.  The information obtained which forms
   the subject of the Iraq Report has, unusually, been obtained without a UN
   presence  within  the  country  as  following  attacks   on   its   Iraqi
   headquarters, the UN withdrew from Iraq and has not returned; as recently
   as December 2005 the UNHCR confirmed that  Iraqi  operations  were  still
   being run on "remote management" basis, in close  co-operation  with  the
   authorities within Iraq.

56. At paragraph B27(a) the Report stated:

    "27. Religious minorities including Christians and Mandaeans  represent
          approximately 3% of an estimated Iraqi population of 24  million.
          The fall of the former r�gime  has  seen  explosion  of  Islamist
          extremist  movement  and  militias,  which  target  among  others
          members of religious minorities.   The  latter  have  become  the
          regular victims  of  discrimination,  harassment,  and  at  times
          persecution with incidents ranging from intimidation and  threats
          to the destruction of property, kidnapping and murder.


    28.  Iraq's Christian population includes among others, members of  the
          Assyrian, Chaldean, Armenian and Catholic  sects.  Many  Assyrian
          Christians  originate  from  the  Governorate  of  Nimewa   whose
          capital, Mosul, is  the  second  largest  city  in  Iraq.   Other
          Assyrians, including some  members  of  the  Assyrian  Democratic
          Party or sympathisers thereof, originate  from  Baghdad  and  its
          original surroundings.  Many of Iraq's other Christians originate
          from Basrah.   Most Iraqi Christians claim  fear  of  persecution
          from insurgent groups (e.g. Ansar Al-Sunna) and  Islamic  militia
          such as the Bardr organisation or  the  Mehdi  Army,  which  have
          substantial control of the streets in various  major  cities  and
          towns.


    29.   Since  the  fall  of  the  former  r�gime,  the  largely  secular
          environment that previously existed in Iraq  has  been  seriously
          eroded... While much of the hardship  and  harassment  that  they
          report that they face is symptomatic of the situation of  general
          insecurity faced by all Iraqis in present-day  Iraq,  members  of
          the Christian minority nevertheless  appear  to  be  particularly
          targeted.  Iraqi Christians feel  especially  apprehensive  about
          the overwhelming presence of extremist Islamic groups  and  armed
          militias whose display of  intolerance  towards  non-Muslims  has
          become a nearly daily feature in Iraq.


    30.  Resentment towards Christians appears to be particularly  vehement
          in the South and in the so-called  Sunni  triangle  where  rising
          extremist attitudes are fuelling the  trend  towards  a  stricter
          interpretation of Islam.


    31.  Whilst discriminatory acts against Christians do not always amount
          to persecution per se, the results are  combined  and  continuous
          discriminatory measures must be assessed carefully in each  case,
          since they could amount to  persecution  on  cumulative  grounds.
          Particular consideration should be given  to  those  cases  where
          discrimination creates  unreasonable  obstacles  [and]  makes  it
          impossible to earn a livelihood or enjoy  socio-economic  rights,
          or has created a climate of fear, insecurity or apprehension  for
          the individual concerned."               [Emphasis added]


20.  The Report considered imputed political opinion, at paragraph 42-43 -

    "42. Iraqis who previously worked for, presently work for, or have  any
          type  of  association  with  the  MNF  or  any  other   type   of
          international  organization  or  company  are  perceived  by  the
          insurgency as condoning and supporting the occupation of Iraq and
          have been indiscriminately targeted since the fall of the  former
          r�gime.  Since  there  are  no  clear  indicators  regarding  how
          insurgent groups choose their targets,  the  only  distinguishing
          factors seems to be any type of affiliation, perceived  or  real,
          with the forces considered  to  be  'occupiers',  although  other
          factors such as an individual's  religion,  ethnicity  or  gender
          may, in the eyes of perpetrators, constitute additional  criteria
          for targeting specific persons.

    43.  Acts committed against employees or perceived  supporters  of  the
          MNF or international organizations or  companies  may  vary  from
          verbal harassment and threats to individuals and  their  families
          to stop working for the 'enemy' to kidnapping,  physical  attacks
          and even murder.  Neither the local authorities nor the  MNF  are
          capable of granting proper security  to  their  respective  local
          nationals and employees.  Annex  7  of  that  Report  deals  with
          internal flight or relocation alternative and advises against the
          possibility of internal relocation in all  parts  of  central  or
          Southern  Iraq,  as  it  is  considered  neither   relevant   nor
          reasonable.  In the three Northern Governorates, it records  that
          the KRG authorities are  "implementing  strict  controls  on  the
          presence of non-Kurdish persons in their areas depending upon the
          applicant especially his or  her  ethnic  and  political  profile
          he/she may well not be allowed to relocate to the three  Northern
          Governorates for security or political reasons.    While  certain
          factors seem to lead clearly to a denial of admission, e.g.  form
          of  Ba'ath  Party  membership  or  a  criminal  record  at  times
          decisions seem to be taken in a discretionary manner  and  it  is
          difficult to establish clear criteria  to  predict  who  will  be
          admitted or rejected."


57. Mosul and Kirkuk have already absorbed just under  22,000  IDP  families
   but for persons not originating from there, are now considered not to  be
   a safe refuge area -

         "13...until the status of Kirkuk and other disputed areas has  been
         addressed, any population movements to that area  could  exacerbate
         already existing tensions, and lead to  further  displacement.   In
         addition, the Turkomen, Kurdish and Arab communities in Kirkuk have
         recently decided to form an IDP Committee,  which  will  be  tasked
         with among other  issues  verifying  that  potential  returnees  to
         Kirkuk are able to prove prior residence in Kirkuk before they will
         be admitted to the city.  Persons who originate from  elsewhere  in
         Iraq and are unable to prove past links to  Kirkuk  will  therefore
         have  difficulty  legally  accessing  the  city  unless  they   are
         supported by the Kirkuk authorities, as priority will be  given  to
         former residents who wish to return rather than to new arrivals."

58. The Northern Governorates have introduced strict  security  measures  at
   their checkpoints to reject anybody  who  does  not  originate  from  the
   respective Governorate or have a Kurdish sponsor to guarantee his or  her
   entry and stay among other criteria. This appellant has no such  sponsor;
   M's parents may live in Kirkuk but they are under no obligation  to  her.
   She does not speak Kurdish and  has,  herself,  no  connection  with  the
   North. Her distant cousin D did what he could for her but will  not  help
   her further; indeed, it is doubtful whether he is still in the country.

59. The Report identifies (paragraphs 37-39) the major factor  in  assessing
   reasonableness of return as whether a person has family, community and or
   political links in the proposed area of  relocation  to  permit  economic
   survival and  integration.   Integration  difficulties  are  particularly
   strong for those like this appellant, who do not speak either Kurdish  or
   Arabic (the appellant speaks only Assyrian and English).  A letter of  11
   April 2005 from the UNHCR gives further support to the  difficulties  for
   Christians in Iraq and particularly the pressure for Christian  women  to
   wear the hijab.

60. The Beth Suryoyo Assyrian Forum as at 3 December 2005  provided  a  non-
   exclusive list of deaths reported in the media  including  on  March  16,
   General  Alcub,  a  Chaldo-Assyrian  assassinated  returning  from   home
   Baghdad.   General  Alcub  a  former  Deacon  at  the  Chaldean  Catholic
   Cathedral, reopened the Kirkuk police force  after  the  fall  of  Saddam
   Hussain and openly criticised the Kurdish position on  the  ownership  of
   Kirkuk.  The Report records numerous incidents, including three deaths of
   Assyrians in the quarter of Baghdad where the appellant used to  live;  a
   car bomb in June 2005 in Kirkuk (which killed a  child  and  injured  his
   parents); kidnapping in Kirkuk on 11 August 2005; an attack on the guards
   of the former Iraqi Minister of Displacement and Migration, (six  guards,
   four  killed and one injured);  the storming of a Christian home in  East
   Baghdad ; the death of four Christian women (despite it being a Christian
   majority area) ; the death of another police officer on 2 December 2005 ;
   and the assassination of  M  on  29  October  2005,  after  he  had  been
   threatened by the KDP , asking him to quit his job as an oil engineer and
   join the Party.

61. A press report on 23 February 2005 from the Guardian newspaper,  written
   by the President of Assyrian National Assembly in Iraq states that -

      "Systematic  low-level  ethnic  cleansing  has  driven  thousands  of
    Assyrian Christians from their homes.   Our churches  have  been  fire-
    bombed and our women forced to wear the hijab".

62. A Report from Human Rights Watch  (  October  2005)  identifies  attacks
   against Christians in Baghdad as having begun in  March  2004,  when  two
   children aged 5 and 14 were shot, after  their  parents  were  warned  by
   Harakat and Ansar Al-Islam, apparently because their father sold alcohol.
    There are also reports of destruction of churches and of  relocation  by
   hundreds of Christians to Arbil,  Sulemaniya  and  Kirkuk  (the  Northern
   Governorates). For families with male members that may perhaps remain  an
   option but the UNHCR evidence   is  of  marked  lack  of  enthusiasm  for
   further inward migration by those living in  the  Northern  Governorates,
   coupled with increasingly strong controls imposed on inward movement.

63. Human Rights Watch reinforces the evidence of  the  risk  to  Iraqi  and
   foreign civilians working for or suspected of working  for  the  MNF  and
   perceived as collaborators.  Attacks  are  intended  as  "punishment  for
   perceived collaboration and as a warning to  others  who  might  consider
   such work".  Whilst the evidence is largely anecdotal, it is  clear  that
   connections between Christians and the MNF, whether  perceived  or  real,
   have been the motivating force of a good many  deaths  of  both  men  and
   women in the last  year.   The  section  headed  'Attacks  on  Women'  is
   particularly helpful:

    "Some insurgent groups have targeted women who are  politicians,  civil
    servants, journalists, women's rights activists, who work  as  cleaners
    or translators for foreign governments or militaries.    They have also
    attacked them for what they considered immoral or un-Islamic  behaviour
    like dancing, socialising with men, or not wearing a hijab (the Islamic
    headscarf) and some groups have abducted and at  times  killed  foreign
    women to pressure government or humanitarian organisations into leaving
    Iraq.


    Not all of these attacks are on  account  of  gender.   Many  of  these
    attacks appear  to  have  been  motivated  primarily  by  the  victims'
    perceived connection to the foreign military presence  or  the  current
    Iraqi government as described in the chapters in this report that cover
    those targeted groups.


    The attacks against women's rights  activists  and  women  who  exhibit
    behaviour deemed immoral or un-Islamic however do seem motivated by the
    fact that the targets were women or helping women.


    In general, the violence and lack of  security  as  well  as  religious
    cultural conservativism are now having a major impact on  Iraqi  women,
    who once enjoyed a prominent r�le in their country's public life.   The
    danger of kidnapping and assaults keeps many professional women at home
    and limits their participation  in  the  country's  evolving  political
    institutions. "

64. According to a January 2005 report by Women for Women International  the
   violence is preventing women from playing a r�le  in civic life:


     "Women with Western dress and progressive  ideas  have  been  attacked.
      The abduction and murders of these prominent women have sent a  ripple
      of fear through local communities. Although the press has covered  the
      stories of high profile foreign aid  workers  Iraqi  women  have  seen
      members of their own communities, pharmacists, lawyers, council  women
      assassinated.  The  effect  is  chilling  and  threatens  the   public
      participation of Iraq's most educated women...the  fear  of  violence,
      abduction and rape have  emptied  the  streets  of  women  and  caused
      disruption to education as children  are  also  increasingly  kept  at
      home.  Growing numbers of women are also leaving the country".

   In an interview with Ms Yanar Muhammad, who founded the  Organisation  of
   Women's Freedom in Iraq she said that she received death threats as early
   as 2004 after defending women's rights  on  Iraqi  television.   She  was
   told:  "Stop speaking out for women's rights or we will kill you".  An E-
   mail signed by Jaysh Al-Sahaba (Army of the Prophet's Companions)  stated
   that because of her psychologically disturbed ideas they  would  have  to
   kill her and crucify her. Ms Muhammad told the press: "It sounded  to  me
   like a serious warning".  In this context, we  remind  ourselves  of  C's
   involvement with Beit Nahrain, a movement for the rights of Assyrians and
   women in Iran.  That concludes our review  of  the  evidence  before  the
   Tribunal.

   Decision
65. We deal first  with  general  risk  categories,  having  regard  to  the
   objective evidence summarised above -

     1. Male Christians.  We have not heard full argument on the  risk  for
        men based on Christianity, or  upon  alternatively  Chaldo-Assyrian
        ethnicity.  The country guidance decision in  RA  stands  in  those
        respects,  but  this  decision  modifies  the  Tribunal's   country
        guidance position in relation to Christian  women  in  Iraq  and  a
        detailed consideration of  the  position  of  male  Chaldo-Assyrian
        Christians is for another decision. The  evidence  of  risk  to  an
        ordinary male Iraqi Christian with family  members  still  in  Iraq
        shows progressive deterioration due to the ongoing  hostilities  in
        Iraq under the control of the MNF but we reach no  firm  conclusion
        as to whether it yet amounts to persecution or breaches  Article  3
        ECHR.

     2. Christians.  Christian observance outside the home is  increasingly
        difficult with few Churches  available  and  harassment  for  those
        entering and leaving them.  Many Christians  have  left  Iraq,  and
        others  like  this  appellant  go  to  Church   only   irregularly,
        preferring to practise their religion in the safety of their homes.
         There is a particular difficulty for women,  since  as  Christians
        they do not wish to cover their heads with the hijab,  which  makes
        them conspicuous on the street and at work.

     3. Association with the MNF.  Those  (male  or  female)  who  work  in
        prominent positions in companies associated with the MNF  or  doing
        business with the West are at risk of  death  or  kidnapping,  they
        will be perceived both as wealthy (and thus worth kidnapping),  and
        more dangerously, as collaborating with the occupying forces and if
        unable to relocate, there is a real risk of  persecution  or  death
        for such people  and  their  family  members.   Again,  in  Refugee
        Convention terms, the risk relates  to  their  perceived  political
        opinion as collaborators  with  the  occupying  forces,  as  Iraqis
        perceive the MNF to be.

     4. Chaldo-Assyrians.  Chaldo-Assyrians  are  a  specific,  very  small
        ethnic group.  They speak Assyrian, and if educated, may be English
        speakers.  They do not speak Arabic or Kurdish.  They are likely to
        be Christians.

66. English speakers.    The  risk  of  being  regarded  as  a  collaborator
   increases for those who speak English, especially if they  do  not  speak
   Kurdish or  Arabic.  The  Tribunal  has  considered  the  sponsor's  oral
   evidence, the documentary evidence and the  appellant's  application  and
   reached the following conclusions.  We have  reminded  ourselves  of  the
   appropriate standard of proof (balance of  probabilities)  and  that  the
   burden of proof is on the appellant to that standard.

67.  There  are  special  risks  for  educated  women  and  for  Christians,
   particularly those of Chaldo-Assyrian ethnicity.  The  following  is  our
   guidance on the position of women in Iraq, particularly  those  from  the
   Chaldo-Assyrian Christian community -

      i) Women. Before the Iraq war, Iraqi women played a full part in civic
         life, able to work and to campaign on  behalf  of  women's  rights.
         Those who are still attempting to do so are now at  enhanced  risk,
         as are their family members. Professional women cannot  expect  the
         social freedom they had previously and may be obliged to remain  at
         home.  Many educated women have already left Iraq.

     ii)  Non-hijab  wearers.  Women  who,  as  Christians,  or  because  of
         Westernised  views,  do  not  wear  the  hijab   will   be   easily
         identifiable and at increased risk on that account.   The  risk  is
         one  of  perceived  political  opinion  (Western  or  MNF  support/
         collaboration) and/or religion (un-Islamic behaviour). Women living
         in Iraq who refuse  to  wear  the  hijab  risk  discrimination  and
         harassment on a daily basis, and some will suffer  kidnappings  and
         death.  The risks from this factor alone do  not  reach  the  level
         required  for  persecution  and  remain,  just,  at  the  level  of
         discrimination and harassment, except, on the evidence  before  us,
         in Basra.  The situation has deteriorated and may well  deteriorate
         further to a  level  at  which  not  wearing  the  hijab  could  be
         sufficient on  its  own,  but  that  is  not  the  position  today.
         However, the addition of one other factor can be enough to tip  the
         balance and engage international protection.

68. Internal flight. The Secretary of State's OGN accepts that there  is  no
   sufficiency of protection for those at risk in the South  and  centre  of
   Iraq at present.  Return is likely to be to Baghdad, and in  relation  to
   individuals who have risk factors in the South, the  Secretary  of  State
   should be prepared to explain how they could return in  safety  to  their
   particular area of origin.  If it is Baghdad then the  risk  is  incurred
   immediately. The risk to those who return to the South  may  be  less  if
   they have family who can ensure their reintegration.

69. KDG links and the Northern Governorates. Persons with links to  the  KDG
   may be able to mitigate their position by internal relocation, but  entry
   to the Northern Governorates is restricted.  The Governorates of  Kirkuk,
   Sulaimaniyah and Dohuk are now accepting only those  who  have  a  proven
   link to their territories, or for whom (and  in  this  respect,  specific
   evidence is required) someone in the territory  is  prepared  to  sponsor
   them.  In general, those who are admitted to the KDG will be  of  Kurdish
   origin and will be Kurdish speakers, particularly as the  evidence  shows
   that the Northern Governorates have tightened  entry  controls  to  these
   areas.

70. Conclusion.  Not every Christian woman  returning  to  Iraq  will  be  a
   refugee on the facts as they stand today; the list given above should not
   be treated as a shopping list.  For example, a woman with family  support
   and access to the KDG, who  is  prepared  to  wear  the  hijab,  will  be
   significantly safer than the present appellant.  Each case will  turn  on
   its own particular facts, but where a person falls into  several  of  the
   categories set out in paragraph 66 above, a Tribunal  may  well  conclude
   (unless there is any significant change for the better in Iraq) that such
   a person is at risk engaging both the Refugee Convention  and  Article  3
   ECHR.

   The facts of LM's case

71. LM is an English-speaking Assyrian Christian woman, educated,  non-hijab
   wearing and formerly holding a significant position in  a  company  which
   traded with the MNF or occupying forces. Her account has been accepted in
   full as credible against the background evidence.

72. LM has no family support in Iraq and  is  a  family  member  of  C,  who
   campaigned for women's rights and the rights of  Assyrians.   She  speaks
   neither Kurdish nor Arabic and has no sponsor  in  the  KDG.   We  remind
   ourselves that before coming to the United  Kingdom,  the  appellant  was
   regularly harassed and threatened on the street and at her place of  work
   in Baghdad. In October 2005, armed men came to her home,  which  was  the
   reason she returned to the United Kingdom to visit B.

73. Her sister C's involvement in Beit Nahrain has resulted in  C's  husband
   disappearing.  That is in line with the background evidence and, since no
   ransom demand has been received, it is  very  likely  that  he  has  been
   killed.   C left Iraq, as did the  appellant's  parents.   The  risk  the
   appellant as a family member of C's  family  is  an  aggravating  factor,
   increasing the risk for this  appellant,  based  on  perceived  political
   opinion (rights of Iraqi women, Beit Nahrain).

74. The appellant has no internal relocation option.   She  has  no  one  to
   sponsor her in the KDG and she formerly  lived  and  worked  in  Baghdad.
   LM's particular profile is such as to put her at risk today; the evidence
   is overwhelming that a conspicuous  Christian  woman,  with  no  Northern
   languages, fluent English, a history of collaboration with the  West  and
   no family support anywhere in Iraq is at  real  risk  of  persecution  by
   Islamic militants.

75. We have considered the Secretary of State's argument that these  matters
   are not relevant because the appellant's decision to return was triggered
   by the death of M and C's husband's disappearance and that  arguments  in
   this respect should be limited to the sur place  element  of  her  claim.
   However, we think that is an unsafe way in which to approach  the  agreed
   facts of the present case.  It is clear  from  the  appellant's  evidence
   throughout that she was the subject of harassment by virtue of  her  r�le
   as a high-profile working woman and her failure  to  wear  the  hijab  at
   work. She was feeling increasingly nervous during 2005.  The threats  and
   discrimination of which she was the victim during that  period  were  not
   too much for her to  withstand  and  she  continued  to  work  regardless
   although she did come to the United Kingdom to visit B returning  briefly
   and then re-entering on the same visitor's visa to complete that visit.

76. In the light of the deteriorating circumstances  in  Iraq  for  Assyrian
   Christians and those associated  with  the  MNF,  we  consider  that  the
   subjective operation of the death of M as  far  away  as  Kirkuk  (whilst
   working for the same company  and  in  a  public  negotiating  r�le  very
   similar  to  that  which  the  appellant  held  in  Baghdad),   and   the
   disappearance of C's husband, were sufficient to drive the  appellant  to
   the decision she made, not to return to Iraq.  Her subjective  perception
   that the risk she would now run on return had reached a  level  where  it
   was too dangerous for her, is objectively justified in the light  of  the
   background evidence.

77.  We  are  quite  satisfied  on  these  particular  facts  that  in   the
   circumstances that prevail in Iraq today a lone woman of this appellant's
   profile is at real risk of Article 3 or Article 2 ill-treatment and  that
   there is a reasonable degree of likelihood if returned she  would  suffer
   persecution or possibly even death.

78. This appeal is allowed under the Refugee Convention and Article 3 ECHR.
