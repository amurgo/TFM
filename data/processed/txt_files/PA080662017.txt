Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr E Waheed, instructed by A. Vincent Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr T Lindsay, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria, born on [ ] 1980. He  has  been
      given permission to appeal against the decision of First-tier Tribunal
      Judge Harris dismissing his appeal against the  respondent's  decision
      of 16 August 2017 to refuse his asylum and human rights claim.

   2. The appellant entered the United Kingdom on 10  September  2012  as  a
      Tier 4 student and was given further periods of  leave  to  remain  on
      that basis until 19 April 2016. His subsequent application for further
      leave  to  remain  outside  the  immigration  rules  was  refused  and
      certified as clearly unfounded on 14 March 2017 and he  then  made  an
      application for leave to remain on 4 July 2017 on the basis of  family
      and private life. He was detained when reporting on 6  July  2017  and
      claimed asylum. His claim was refused on 16 August 2017.  He  appealed
      against that decision and his  appeal  was  heard  in  the  First-tier
      Tribunal on  28  September  2017  and  was  dismissed  in  a  decision
      promulgated on 5 October 2017.


The Appellant's Claim

   3. The appellant claims that  his  father,  a  teacher,  was  politically
      active and critical of the  Nigerian  government's  treatment  of  the
      people of Biafra and was abducted, tortured and  killed  in  1999.  He
      claims that he (the appellant)  became  a  member  of  the  Indigenous
      People of Nigeria Movement (IPOB) in Nigeria and had  a  role  in  the
      movement as zonal  coordinator  for  Okigwe.  From  time  to  time  he
      received threats as a result and on 3 February 2011 he  was  kidnapped
      together with his 12 year old cousin when  travelling  in  a  car  and
      handed over to another group of kidnappers  whom  he  believed  to  be
      associated with the Nigerian government. They told him that they could
      do the same to him as they did to his father and they raped his cousin
      in front of him and then released her. They beat and tortured him  and
      he was subsequently diagnosed as having post-traumatic stress disorder
      as a result. His mother paid a ï¿½10,000 bribe to secure his release. He
      was released on 25 February 2011 and fled to Lagos where he  hid  with
      an old family friend whom he considered as an  uncle.  The  kidnappers
      called him on his telephone number. He managed  to  obtain  a  student
      visa for the UK in August 2012 and left Nigeria in September 2012.  He
      fears people connected to the Nigerian government. The  appellant  met
      his wife Ms A in 2013 and they were married  on  5  February  2017  in
      Lagos, with the appellant represented through a proxy.

   4.  The respondent, in refusing the appellant's  claim,  did  not  accept
      that he was ever a member or supporter of IPOB  or  any  other  Biafra
      movement and did not accept that he  was  kidnapped  as  claimed.  The
      respondent  considered  that  the  timing  of  the  appellant's  claim
      undermined his credibility. It was not accepted that he was at risk on
      return to Nigeria or that his removal  to  Nigeria  would  breach  his
      human rights.

   5. The appellant's appeal against that decision was heard  by  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge Harris on 28 September 2017. The judge heard  from  the
      appellant and his wife and considered a Rule 35 report from a Dr N Ali
      which commented that he had PTSD  and  was  on  anti-depressants.  The
      judge noted the appellant's wife's evidence that  he  had  been  raped
      when kidnapped and that she had observed  him  suffering  from  mental
      health problems and had encouraged  him  to  seek  expert  psychiatric
      help. The judge found there to be matters in  the  appellant's  favour
      when assessing credibility but considered  that  his  reliability  was
      outweighed in the end by various concerns. Whilst he was  prepared  to
      accept that the appellant may have suffered  some  sort  of  traumatic
      incident in Nigeria involving physical and sexual  abuse  he  did  not
      accept the appellant's claim as to who was responsible  for  that  and
      why. He did not accept that the appellant was  politically  active  in
      IPOB or that  he  was  targeted,  kidnapped  and  abused  by  Nigerian
      security forces or supporters of the Nigerian government. He  did  not
      accept that the appellant's enemies had tried to trace him and he  did
      not accept that he had been politically active in the  UK.  The  judge
      was not satisfied that the appellant would be at any risk on return to
      Nigeria and considered that his removal would  not  breach  his  human
      rights on Article 3 or 8 grounds.

   6. The appellant then sought permission to appeal the judge's decision on
      the grounds that he had failed to provide adequate reasons for finding
      the appellant not to be credible and had  failed  to  apply  paragraph
      339K of the immigration rules. The judge's findings on  insurmountable
      obstacles and very significant obstacles for the purposes of  Appendix
      FM and paragraph 276ADE were also challenged in relation to  the  risk
      on return.


   7. Permission was granted in the First-tier  Tribunal  on  the  following
      grounds:


   "...the  judge  arguably  arrived  at  an  irrational  finding  that  the
   appellant had not given a credible account to have come  to  the  adverse
   attention of the Nigerian security forces given that the judge  found  at
   paragraph 64 of his decision that he was  prepared  to  accept  that  the
   appellant may  have  suffered  a  traumatic  incident  in  Nigeria  which
   involved physical and sexual abuse."

Appeal Hearing

   8. At the hearing both parties made submissions before me.

   9. Mr Waheed submitted that it  was  irrational  for  the  judge,  having
      accepted at [64] the appellant's evidence about sexual abuse, to  have
      then relied upon that evidence and its disclosure to cast doubt on the
      appellant's credibility at [54], [55], [57]  and  [58].  Further,  the
      judge had failed to comply with  paragraph  339K  of  the  immigration
      rules as he had failed to give good reasons for  concluding  that  the
      previous serious harm would not be  repeated.  The  challenge  to  the
      judge's findings on Article 8 flowed from the errors made in  relation
      to risk on return.


  10. Mr Lindsay, in response, relied on the respondent's Rule 24 reply  and
      submitted that the judge's findings on credibility were not irrational
      and that he had been entitled to dismiss the appeal  for  the  reasons
      given at [54] to [64]. With regard to paragraph  339K  the  burden  of
      proof was upon the appellant to show good reasons why the serious harm
      would be repeated. As to Article 8, the judge was entitled to  require
      that the appellant make an entry clearance application from Lagos.

Consideration and findings

  11. Having carefully considered the submissions of both parties  it  seems
      to me that the grounds fail to establish that there were any errors of
      law in the judge's decision. It was entirely  open  to  the  judge  to
      accept parts  of  the  appellant's  evidence  and  to  reject  others,
      provided that he gave full and proper reasons for doing  so,  which  I
      consider that he did.

  12. Aside from the appellant's own evidence, the judge noted that the only
      evidence submitted in support of the claim was that of  his  wife  and
      the Rule 35 report. The judge noted the absence of  medical  evidence,
      other than the Rule 35 report, to support the appellant's account.  He
      acknowledged at [47] that there was no requirement  for  corroboration
      as such, but properly observed that the burden of proof lay  upon  the
      appellant to make out his case and was entitled to take  into  account
      the absence of evidence that could reasonably have been obtained.  The
      judge gave full consideration to the evidence of the appellant's  wife
      and of Dr Ali in the Rule 35 report and  provided  cogent  reasons  at
      [50] and [53] for according that evidence the weight that he  did.  It
      was on the basis of that evidence that  he  was  prepared  to  accept,
      although only just, that the appellant may have suffered some sort  of
      traumatic incident in Nigeria involving physical and sexual abuse,  as
      he found at [64]. However the judge was not then required, having made
      that  finding,  to  accept  that  the   incident   occurred   in   the
      circumstances and for the reasons claimed  by  the  appellant  and  he
      provided detailed and cogent reasons for concluding that it had not.

  13. At [54] the judge noted that the appellant had made no mention himself
      of having been raped, in any of the accounts given, and  that  it  was
      only raised by his wife at the hearing. At  [56]  the  judge  observed
      that the appellant made no mention, in his first interview, of fearing
      for his safety in  Nigeria  when  asked  why  he  would  not  consider
      returning there. At [57] the judge noted that no mention was made,  in
      the written representations of 4 July 2017, of the  appellant  wishing
      to make a protection claim, of his claimed role in IPOB  or  of  being
      kidnapped and ill-treated, and at [58] that no mention was made in the
      first screening  interview  of  the  kidnapping.  At  [59]  the  judge
      observed that the appellant did not leave Nigeria until a month  after
      obtaining a visa, despite his claim to be in great danger, and at [60]
      that his account of his movements in Lagos was not consistent  with  a
      claim to have been in hiding. At [61] the judge found the  appellant's
      evidence  as  to  his  political  involvement  in   the   UK   to   be
      contradictory. At [62] he noted the delay in the appellant's claim for
      asylum. All of these reasons were given by the judge for  finding  the
      appellant's account  of  kidnapping  and  torture  to  be  lacking  in
      credibility and for all of those reasons he was perfectly entitled  to
      make such adverse findings and to reject the appellant's claim  as  he
      did at [64]. It was not a matter, as suggested by Mr  Waheed,  of  the
      judge using the circumstances of  the  appellant's  disclosure  of  an
      accepted event to reject his credibility. The  judge  did  not  accept
      that the incident described by the appellant occurred and it is  plain
      from his finding at [64] that what  he  was  prepared  to  accept  was
      simply that there may have been some other incident in the past  which
      had no link to, or bearing on, the appellant's claim to be at risk  on
      return. I find nothing irrational in the judge's  conclusion  in  that
      regard and neither do I find it to be in any way inconsistent with the
      approach in paragraph 339K.

  14. For all of these reasons the judge was fully and properly entitled  to
      find that the appellant's account  was  not  a  credible  one  and  to
      conclude that he was at no risk on return to  Nigeria.  As  Mr  Waheed
      indicated, the  remaining  grounds  flowed  from  the  above  and  the
      challenge to the judge's findings on Article 8 was founded on the same
      reasons for the challenge to the judge's findings on  credibility  and
      risk on return. The judge was  perfectly  entitled  to  conclude  that
      there were no insurmountable obstacles to family  life  continuing  in
      Nigeria, that there were no very significant obstacles to  integration
      in Nigeria and that there were no compelling circumstances  justifying
      a grant of leave outside the immigration  rules  on  wider  Article  8
      grounds. He provided  full  and  cogent  reasons  for  reaching  those
      conclusions at [83] to [109], taking account of all  relevant  matters
      and was fully entitled to conclude that the appellant's removal  would
      not breach his Article 8 human rights.


  15. On the evidence available, and for  the  reasons  fully  and  properly
      given, the judge was unarguably entitled to reach the conclusions that
      he did and to dismiss the appeal on the basis that he did. I  find  no
      errors of law in the judge's decision. I uphold the decision.

DECISION

  16. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not  involve
      an error on a point of law. I do  not  set  aside  the  decision.  The
      decision to dismiss the appeal stands.


    Anonymity

    The First-tier Tribunal made an order for  anonymity.  I  continue  the
    order pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)
    Rules 2008.
