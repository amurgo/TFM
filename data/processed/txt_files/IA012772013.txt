                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS




     1. On the 20th August 2013 the determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
        Judge Deavin, promulgated on 26th March 2013, in which  he  allowed
        the appeal was set aside for the reasons set out in  the  error  of
        law finding and directions document dated 21st August 2013.  At the
        Resumed hearing on the 21st October 2013 Mr Wu was advised that his
        appeal will be dismissed  under  both  the  Immigration  Rules  and
        Article 8 ECHR but allowed to the extent  it  is  remitted  to  the
        Secretary of State for a lawful removal decision to be made. It was
        accepted by Mrs Pettersen that the decision made  contemporaneously
        with the refusal to vary  leave  pursuant  to  section  47  of  the
        Immigration Asylum and Nationality Act 2006 is 'not  in  accordance
        with the law'.



Discussion



     2. Mr Wu arrived in the United Kingdom  on  18th  December  2003  with
        entry clearance as a work permit holder valid  from  28th  November
        2003 to 28th May 2005.  Further periods of leave were granted valid
        until 7th November 2010. On 3rd June 2010 he applied for settlement
        as a work permit holder which  was  refused  by  the  Secretary  of
        State, in a decision dated 21st December 2012, by reference to  the
        provisions of  paragraph  134  of  the  Immigration  Rules  and  by
        reference to paragraph 322  (1A)  as  it  was  stated  that  Mr  Wu
        provided false documents in an attempt to deceive the Secretary  of
        State with regard to his employment as part of his  application  to
        obtain leave to remain.


     3. Paragraph 322 (1A) is one of the grounds on which leave  to  remain
        and variation of leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom are
        to be refused. It is a mandatory requirement the wording  of  which
        is:


              (1A)     where false representations have been made  or  false
   documents or                 information have been submitted (whether  or
   not material to the                   application, and whether or not  to
   the applicant's knowledge), or                 material  facts  have  not
   been disclosed, in relation to  the  application                   or  in
   order to obtain  documents  from  the  Secretary  of  State  or  a  third
     party required in support of the application.


     4. Mr Wu was granted a work permit for the purposes of  employment  at
        James' Fish Bar in Colwyn Bay  where  he  worked  as  a  chef.   In
        support of his continued employment in accordance with the terms of
        his  work  permit  he  provided  a  letter  dated  1st  June   2010
        purportedly written by a Siu Tung Wan, together with  a  number  of
        payslips purportedly showing continued employment at the  Fish  Bar
        for the months of March, April and May 2010. The letter is  in  the
        following terms:


              To whom it may concern


              RE: Mr ZhangYe WU D.O.B 01/02/1968 - Application of Indefinite
   Leave               to Remain in the United Kingdom.


              I am writing this letter to confirm that the above  person  is
   currently                    employed as a Chef by our restaurant.


              Mr Wu has proved to be hard working, dedicated,  and  reliable
   and   has                   successfully   handled    all    tasks    and
   responsibilities given to him.   His                     performances  to
   date  are  satisfactory  and   I   have   no   reason   to   doubt   that
   his employment will continue with our company.


              Should you have any further queries, please do not hesitate to
   contact me.


     5. The wage slips show receipt of a gross income of �1,000  per  month
        upon which PAYE of �92.08 and national  insurance  of  �57.57  have
        been deducted leaving a net pay of �850.35. However, the  Secretary
        of State has provided a copy letter from  HMRC  dated  10th  August
        2010 stating that in  relation  to  PAYE  they  have  a  record  of
        employment for Mr Wu with a Mr J Wan between 2005 and 2007  at  117
        Abergele Road but that there is no current employment shown on  his
        record.


     6. Additional evidence provided by the Secretary of State  includes  a
        copy of the Home Office records relating to the consideration of Mr
        Wu's case. These record receipt of the application dated  3rd  June
        2010, the request to HMRC made upon receipt in July 2010 and, as  a
        result of the information received from HMRC, an attempt being made
        to contact James' Fish Bar to confirm Mr  Wu's  alleged  employment
        there. The record shows that the letter from the Fish Bar  contains
        an incorrect telephone number as the number provided as that  of  a
        private  house.  The  case  worker  records  that  he  subsequently
        obtained the correct telephone number and telephoned the Fish  Bar,
        but was informed that they did not know Mr Wu. As a result of  this
        and concerns recorded relating to  Mr  Wu's  nominated  immigration
        adviser the refusal decision was served to the file. The case  note
        shows that a subsequent review, following correspondence  regarding
        the process of the application, accepted that the decision to serve
        to the file rather than send a copy of the refusal to Mr Wu  and/or
        his nominated representative was wrong, as a result  of  which  the
        application was reconsidered on the basis of the law  in  force  at
        the date of  the  application,  and  in  relation  to  the  current
        provisions of the Immigration Rules to be found in Appendix FM  and
        276ADE. A further refusal was issued dated 21st December 2012 which
        was served on 2nd January 2013.


     7. In his grounds of appeal Mr Wu denies any wrong doing  and  repeats
        his claim to have worked for Mr Wan at the Fish Bar for the  period
        claimed. He also states that in July 2010  his  employer  sold  the
        business at that address and asked him to work for him  at  another
        address.  He claims the employer's letter as well as the wage slips
        were given to him by Mr Wan  and  that  he  was  working  for  this
        individual  at  the  Fish  Bar  at  the  time  he   submitted   his
        application; therefore the documents are genuine. Mr  Wu  maintains
        he was employed by this individual until his business went bankrupt
        around November 2011. He blames his employer for any mistakes made.
        He claims as a result of the delay it is not possible  for  him  to
        undertake enquiries of his own to verify the situation.  He  claims
        Mr Wan has also left the United Kingdom for health reasons.


     8. In A (Nigeria) v SSHD [2010] EWCA  Civ  773  the  Court  of  Appeal
        decided that references to "false" representations and documents in
        paragraph 322(1A) and by implication to 320(7A) and  other  similar
        paragraphs required an element of  dishonesty,  even  though  these
        paragraphs include the words  "(whether  or  not  material  to  the
        application, and whether or not  to  the  applicant's  knowledge)".
        Dishonesty or deception was needed, albeit not necessarily that  of
        the applicant himself, to render a false  representation  a  ground
        for mandatory refusal.


     9. Three issues arise from the documentary and oral evidence given  by
        Mr Wu at the hearing. These are firstly that the  telephone  number
        appearing on the letter purportedly written by Mr  Wan  for  James'
        Fish Bar is incorrect. Mr Wu was asked whether he had  the  correct
        number.  He referred to an address book and  provided  a  telephone
        number similar to that appearing on the letter but not the same. In
        this respect I was referred to the caseworker's records noting that
        the number provided on the letter is that of a private  residential
        address and that contact was eventually established with  the  Fish
        Bar using a different telephone number. The number included on  the
        letter is therefore false.


    10. When asked why, if he was working at the Fish Bar for the period he
        claimed, the case worker was told by the  individual  he  spoke  to
        that he had no knowledge of Mr Wu, he replied that  this  may  have
        been because the employer was not paying income tax on  his  behalf
        that he should have been.  Two issues  arise  from  his  reply  and
        evidence relating to this aspect of the appeal which are (i) if the
        information given to the  case  worker  is  correct,  in  that  the
        proprietor who was spoken to by the case worker did not know Mr Wu,
        he could not have been working there at that time. As a result both
        the letter claiming he was employed at the Fish Bar  in  June  2010
        and the wage slips  supporting  such  alleged  employment  must  be
        false, or, (ii) if Mr Wu was working at the Fish Bar the  statement
        given on the telephone that he was not must  be  a  false/dishonest
        representation. If made to hide the fact Mr Wu was employed at  the
        Fish Bar but that income tax and  national  insurance  that  should
        have been lawfully paid was not been paid this proves the  required
        element of intentional dishonesty.


    11. Mr Wu was also asked why he had not provided a  P60  for  the  year
        ending April 2010 for which no satisfactory answer was provided.


    12. There was also a material discrepancy in relation to  Mr  Wu's  own
        evidence regarding periods of employment.  In his grounds of appeal
        he claimed to have been employed until a date in 2011 when Mr Wan's
        business went bankrupt.  In his oral evidence he  claimed  that  he
        stopped work in June 2010 and not to have worked at all after  this
        time. No satisfactory explanation was provided for this discrepancy
        either.


    13. Having considered the evidence I  am  satisfied  the  Secretary  of
        State has discharged the burden of proof upon her to  the  required
        standard to show that paragraph 322 (1A) is engaged in this appeal.
         I find  it  more  likely  than  not  that  Mr  Wu  is  the  person
        responsible for the production of false documents  in  relation  to
        alleged employment at the Fish Bar at a period of time that he  was
        not working there or had knowledge of the same.  He denies this and
        blames a third party but as shown in the summary of  the  case  law
        above, any dishonesty does not necessarily have to be that  of  the
        appellant, and even if by the named third  party  such  element  of
        dishonesty has been proved. I find paragraph 322(1A) engaged.  This
        is determinative of the appeal under the Rules which is dismissed.


    14. In relation to Article 8  I  find  Mr  Wu  unable  to  satisfy  the
        requirements of the current provisions of  the  Rules  relating  to
        private and/or family life in the United Kingdom and  this  element
        of the appeal is dismissed.


    15. Mr Wu travelled to Hong Kong in 2007 and 2009 to visit his wife and
        two children, a boy and a girl, who are now 20 and 18 years of  age
        respectively.  It was not established that he has any  family  life
        recognised by Article 8 ECHR in the United Kingdom.  I accept  that
        he has a private life in the United Kingdom as he entered  in  2003
        and has worked and has friends but there was little evidence of the
        nature and extent of that private life, the quality of the  private
        life, or to  prove  that  the  private  life  he  has  relating  to
        employment and friendships could not be replicated  elsewhere,  and
        particularly in his home state.  My primary finding is that it  has
        not been established that Article 8 (1) is engaged as  it  has  not
        been proved that any interference with the private life Mr  Wu  has
        developed  in  the  United  Kingdom  will  result  in  consequences
        sufficiently serious to engage Article 8. In  the  alternative,  if
        there were elements of friendships and associations that could  not
        be replicated, it will be my finding that the  Secretary  of  State
        has discharged the  burden  of  proof  upon  her  to  the  required
        standard to prove that the decision is proportionate.  This  is  in
        light of the lack of evidence regarding the quality of any  private
        life, the weight given to the Secretary of State's case in light of
        the use of fraud/deception and the engagement of 322(1A),  and  the
        margin of appreciation available to the Secretary of State relating
        to the control of those permitted to enter into and  remain  within
        the borders of the United Kingdom.


    16. The appeals under the Rules and Article 8 ECHR are dismissed.  Only
        the appeal against the s47 removal direction is allowed.


Decision

    17. The First-tier Tribunal Judge materially erred in law. I  have  set
        aside the decision of the original Judge. I remake the decision  as
        follows. This appeal  is  allowed  to  the  limited  extent  it  is
        remitted to the Secretary of State for a lawful  removal  direction
        to be made


   Anonymity.


    18. The First-tier Tribunal did not make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
        45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
        2005.


          I make no  such  order  (pursuant  to  rule  14  of  the  Tribunal
   Procedure               (Upper Tribunal) Rules  2008)  as  there  was  no
   application for anonymity and the         facts do not establish the need
   for such an order.


   Fee Award.


   Note: this is not part of the determination.


    19. In the light of my decision to re-make the decision in the appeal I
        have considered whether to make a fee award (rule  23A  (costs)  of
        the Asylum and Immigration  Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules  2005  and
        section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
        2007).


          I have had regard to the Joint  Presidential  Guidance  Note:  Fee
   Awards in           Immigration Appeals (December 2011).


          I make no fee award.


          Reasons:     The substantive element of the appeal  failed.  There
   has been the        use of deception. The appeal has only been allowed on
   a legal technicality             relating to the removal direction.
