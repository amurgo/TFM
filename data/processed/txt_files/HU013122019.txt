                        REMAKING DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. This is the remaking component of the decision in this appeal following
    my previous conclusion that the First-tier Tribunal had  erred  in  law
    (contained in the error of law component of this decision,  promulgated
    on 9 January  2020,  appended  below).  In  summary,  when  considering
    whether the Appellant had been dishonest when obtaining and  submitting
    a TOEIC English language  test  certificate  in  2013,  the  First-tier
    Tribunal had failed to have regard to evidence indicating a proficiency
    in English at the time of the test in question. This error was material
    to the Appellant's Article 8 claim as a  whole.  The  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal was set aside and a resumed hearing listed.

The scope of the remaking component of this appeal

 2. As stated in para 17  of  the  error  of  law  conclusions,  I  am  now
    considering the Appellant's Article 8 claim both within and without the
    ambit of the relevant Immigration Rules. An important factual aspect of
    this is the obtaining and use  of  the  TOEIC  test  certificate  ("the
    certificate") through ETS and whether the Appellant  was  dishonest  in
    this regard.

 3. In respect of the dishonesty issue, it is for the Respondent to meet an
    initial evidential burden. If this is done,  the  Appellant  must  then
    provide an innocent explanation; in other words, one that is reasonably
    capable of belief (but no more). If he is able to do  this,  the  legal
    burden rests upon the Respondent to prove  dishonesty.  My  finding  on
    dishonesty will be factored in to my assessment of Article 8.

The evidence

 4. In remaking the decision in this  appeal  I  have  had  regard  to  the
    Respondent's  original  appeal  bundle  prepared  for  the   First-tier
    Tribunal hearing, the Appellant's  unpaginated  bundle,  and  the  oral
    evidence provided at the hearing on 9 March 2020, a full note of  which
    is contained in the record of proceedings.

 5. In summary, the Appellant adopted his witness statement  dated  3  July
    2019 and provided further information about his history of  studies  in
    the United Kingdom. He emphasised the fact  that  his  second  college,
    Anniesland College in Glasgow, was a  publicly-funded  institution  and
    would only accept him onto the course if his English  language  ability
    had been good enough. He accepted that he had not told  the  Respondent
    of a change of address directly; he informed his college  and  expected
    them to pass this on to the Home Office. He stated that he  had  booked
    the English test at South Quay College himself and had paid in cash. He
    had not kept a receipt. He could not have booked an ILETS test  because
    of the long wait involved. Pearson test centres were all fully  booked.
    The Appellant said that a friend of his with whom he had  been  staying
    at the time could confirm that he went to the test centre, but  he  had
    not asked her to come and give evidence. He categorically denied having
    cheated. Finally, he confirmed that he has no wife or children.

Submissions

 6. Mr Kandola relied on the reasons for refusal  letter  dated  9  January
    2019.  He  submitted  that  the  evidence  adduced  by  the  Respondent
    discharged the evidential burden. The Appellant had failed  to  provide
    an  innocent  explanation:  there  were  no  receipts;  there  were  no
    witnesses; the details of the test stated in  the  Appellant's  witness
    statement could have been obtained through publicly available  sources.
    Mr Kandola pointed out the  lack  of  academic  progress  made  by  the
    Appellant whilst in the United Kingdom. By inference, it was more  than
    coincidence that all of the colleges chosen by the  Appellant  had  had
    their licences suspended and then revoked. The  Appellant  obtained  an
    ILETS score of 6.0, but his TOEIC score was 200. Even if the  Appellant
    had put forward an innocent explanation, the  Respondent  was  able  to
    discharge the legal burden.

 7. Mr Kandola suggested that if the Appellant had not in fact received the
    IS.151A notice of liability for removal in 2014, this  was  because  he
    had failed to notify a change of address.

 8. Mr Kandola acknowledged that as the Appellant  had  not  completed  his
    studies in this country because of  the  revocation  of  licences,  the
    concession made in the Court of Appeal at para 37 of Khan  [2018]  EWCA
    Civ 1684  would  potentially  apply  if  the  Appellant  had  not  been
    dishonest. A period of 60 days' leave to remain may be appropriate.

 9. The Appellant re-emphasised  his  assertion  that  he  had  never  been
    dishonest. He had made as such progress in his studies as was possible,
    but the suspension and renovation of the licences  prevented  more.  He
    had tried to contact ETS, but they had been very difficult.  Anniesland
    College and Glyndwr  University  in  London  had  been  publicly-funded
    institutions  and  this  was  important.  He  relied  on  his  academic
    certificates and the two ILETS certificates in his bundle.

10. I was referred to the All-Party Parliamentary  Group  on  TOEIC  report
    dated 18 July 2019, in which criticisms of the Respondent's approach to
    ETS  cases  and  concerns  with  the  evidence  from  ETS  itself   are
    highlighted.

11. In response to this last point, Mr  Kandola  suggested  that  the  APPG
    report was not entirely reliable, as not all of the expert evidence had
    been set out therein.

Findings of fact

12. The combination of the well-known  "generic  evidence"  (including  the
    witness statements of Peter Millington and Rebecca Collings), the Look-
    up Tool , and the extract from  the  Respondent's  database  confirming
    that the Appellant's results were deemed "invalid", are  sufficient  to
    discharge the relatively low evidential burden.

13. In  saying  this,  the  database  extract  refers  to  the  Appellant's
    nationality as "Gibraltar" and this error is relevant  to  the  overall
    assessment of the Respondent's evidence in respect of the legal burden,
    to which I will return in due course.

14. I turn to the Appellant's side of the story, as it  were.  I  find  the
    Appellant's English language ability leading up to the disputed test on
    20 March 2013 is of significance. The two IELTS certificates,  dated  7
    August 2009 and 3 November 2011, have never  been  challenged.  I  find
    them both to be reliable evidence as to the Appellant's ability  as  at
    those points in time; the former being prior  to  his  arrival  in  the
    United Kingdom and the latter after a period of studying  here  in  the
    English medium. The speaking test scores (that being the only component
    said by the Respondent to have involved cheating by the Appellant) were
    6.0 in 2009 and 6.0 in 2011. That was sufficient to place  him  in  the
    CEFR B2 band (at the top of the upper intermediate bracket). I have not
    been referred to any evidence which indicates that this meant that  the
    Appellant was anything other than a  confident  English  speaker.   Nor
    have I been  shown  evidence  which  renders  the  Appellant's  claimed
    increased proficiency in spoken English between 2011 and  the  test  in
    2013 to be so implausible as to be rejected out of hand.

15.  Following from the above, I note that the Appellant's TOEIC  listening
    and reading scores (stated in the Glyndwr University letter of  20  May
    2013)  are  in  line  with  the  B2  level  confirmed  by   the   IELTS
    certificates. The writing element (a score of 200 -  the  highest)  has
    never been the subject of challenge by  the  Respondent.  As  with  the
    Appellant's speaking score, I have not been referred to any evidence to
    indicate  that  his  achievement  in  the  writing  test   was   wholly
    implausible.

16. Mr Kandola has  urged  me  to  find  that  the  Appellant's  choice  of
    educational institutions is problematic: all three had  their  licences
    suspended and then revoked (Glyndwr  University  subsequently  had  its
    licence reinstated, subject to structural changes  in  its  operation).
    The inference I have been asked to draw  is  that  this  is  more  than
    simple coincidence: it indicates that the Appellant was not  a  genuine
    student  all  along.  I  reject  this  submission.  I  find  that   the
    Appellant's evidence on this issue is manifestly reasonably capable  of
    belief. I accept that the Appellant relied on what he  described  as  a
    "consultant" in Nepal  as  to  the  choice  of  the  first  educational
    institution, the Edinburgh School  of  Business.  This  was  a  private
    college. There is no challenge to the evidence used  by  the  Appellant
    when seeking and obtaining entry clearance study at  that  institution.
    At the time the Appellant began his studies, that college had a licence
    and was an A rated  sponsor.  The  Respondent  has  adduced  no  direct
    evidence to show that the Appellant did not undertake any studies there
    at all. I find that he did follow  his  course  of  studies  until  the
    college's licence was suspended on an unknown date in  2010.  There  is
    nothing adverse here  to  the  Appellant's  credibility  as  a  genuine
    student.

17. Following the revocation  of  that  college's  licence,  the  Appellant
    enrolled in a course at Anniesland College in Glasgow in 2011.  I  find
    this institution was publicly-funded and was a Highly Trusted  Sponsor.
    The letter from that institution, dated 15 December  2011,  shows  that
    the Appellant's English language proficiency was tested  (resulting  in
    the second IELTS certificate), and that he was a "hard-working student"
    with a high attendance record. The independent evidence indicates  that
    the Appellant was a genuine student at  that  time.  In  addition,  the
    Appellant's oral evidence added to his overall credibility. He  was  at
    pains to emphasise the fact that following his bad experience with  the
    private college in Edinburgh, he had deliberately sought out a publicly-
    funded institution which he felt might be a  more  reputable  provider.
    Whatever the reality might have  been  in  hindsight,  the  Appellant's
    subjective view makes good sense when seen in its proper context.

18. When Anniesland College lost its Highly  Trusted  Sponsor  status,  the
    Appellant was obliged to find a new educational  provider.  Again,  the
    Appellant has  stated  that  he  wanted  to  attend  a  publicly-funded
    institution, Glyndwr  University,  which  would,  he  had  hoped,  have
    provided  a  stable  and  reputable  platform.  His  enrolment  on  the
    Chartered  Institute  of  Management  Accountants  programme  was   not
    inconsistent with his previous courses. There is no  evidence  to  show
    that the Appellant failed to attend the course for as long  as  it  was
    possible for him to have done so. Indeed, a letter from  CIMA  dated  4
    September 2014, shows that he had completed the Institute's Certificate
    in  Business  Accounting.  As  with  the   previous   two   educational
    institutions, the evidence shows  that  the  Appellant  was  a  genuine
    student  insofar  as  his  intentions  and  actual   performance   were
    concerned.

19. The certificate from ETS in respect of the TOEIC test on 20 March  2013
    was used by the Appellant to gain admission to Glyndwr  University.  Mr
    Kandola is right to point out that there are  a  couple  of  evidential
    shortcomings in the Appellant's explanation  concerning  his  assertion
    that he in fact undertook the  speaking  test  himself.  There  are  no
    receipts confirming the booking of the test or payments made.  Further,
    the Appellant has stated that a friend with whom he was staying at  the
    time could have attended as a witness on his behalf and that she  would
    have been able to confirm that he had gone to the test  centre  on  the
    day in question. There is no evidence from this individual.  These  two
    omissions are relevant, and I take them into account. However,  I  must
    also consider the evidence that I do have, including that presented  by
    the Appellant both in writing and orally. In my view, there is  nothing
    inherently improbable about an individual throwing away a paper receipt
    in circumstances where there was no apparent need for that evidence  to
    be retained. In his oral evidence, the Appellant told me  that  he  had
    initially sought to book a speaking test with IELTS,  but  the  waiting
    time was too long. He had then sought to book a TOEIC test at a Pearson
    institution, but they fully booked up. South Quay College  was,  as  it
    were, a last resort. I accept this evidence is being true. It fits well
    with the overall pattern of the Appellant's behaviour  as  regards  his
    education in the United Kingdom: he had  repeatedly  sought  to  comply
    with the rules, to pursue his studies, and to optimise his  chances  of
    successfully completing those studies.

20. The Appellant's witness statement provides  a  good  amount  of  detail
    concerning his attendance at the test centre and the various components
    of the test in question. None of the  details  have  been  specifically
    challenged by the Respondent. I have not been referred to any  evidence
    which materially undermines the details provided by  the  Appellant  in
    that witness statement. Mr Kandola has  suggested  that  the  Appellant
    could have learned this information from "publicly available  sources",
    but this is entirely speculative. It  is  a  possibility,  but  in  the
    context of the evidence as a whole, a remote one at best.

21. The Appellant stated that due to his good ability  in  English  at  the
    time there was no need for him to have cheated in the speaking test. He
    makes what I consider to be a fair  point;  that  he  had  already  had
    experience with tests, the inference being that a fear of not been able
    to cope with the environment was not a relevant factor in his case.

22. A final point in respect of the Appellant's  explanation  is  the  fact
    that he took it upon himself to contact ETS. A  response  from  ETS  is
    contained in the Appellant's bundle.  Although  it  is  undated,  I  am
    satisfied that the contact was made in 2014 on the basis that a follow-
    up email in the bundle is dated 3 December  2014.  This  correspondence
    supports the Appellant's evidence that it was difficult to  obtain  any
    detailed information from ETS. It is also  consistent  with  the  point
    made earlier concerning the Appellant being  proactive  in  seeking  to
    genuinely pursue studies in this country.

23. In light of the above, the evidential "boomerang" now flies back in the
    Respondent's  direction.  Has  she  provided  sufficient  evidence   to
    undermine what I consider to be the Appellant's strong explanation?

24. I have considered the evidence presented by the Respondent  in  respect
    of South Quay College itself. It was the subject of Project Fa�ade  and
    was severely criticised in respect of  TOEIC  tests  undertaken.  In  a
    sense, this is  the  strongest  evidence  against  the  Appellant.  The
    Appellant's test March 2013 was  within  the  period  assessed  by  the
    investigation. The extract at Annex K the Respondent's bundle indicates
    that abuse was "widespread", and that proxy test-takers were identified
    in the large majority of speaking and writing test sessions examined. I
    have considered this evidence in the context of the  Look  up  Tool  in
    respect  of  the  test  date  in  question  and  the  database  extract
    confirming that the Appellant's speaking test was deemed "invalid".

25. I do not of course have any  voice  recordings  and/or  voice  analysis
    evidence in respect of the Appellant's speaking test. Although it might
    have been possible for the Appellant himself to have  requested  these,
    the legal burden rests upon  the  Respondent  and  there  has  been  no
    attempt (at least as far as I can see) to obtain  the  evidence.  Thus,
    the central evidence upon which ETS apparently relied when  undertaking
    its analysis, and upon which the Respondent now relies  when  asserting
    that the Appellant has been dishonest, is not before me.

26. The erroneous reference to the Appellant being from "Gibraltar" is  not
    entirely irrelevant to my assessment of the evidence as a whole: it  is
    a clear mistake and goes to indicate that  the  recording  of  relevant
    information is certainly not infallible.

27. I acknowledge the fact that there may be a variety of reasons as to why
    an individual would cheat in a test. A known lack of proficiency may be
    one; so too may be a fear of a test environment in general. However, in
    the present case, I have found that the Appellant already  had  a  good
    proficiency in  English  by  March  2013,  that  he  had  had  previous
    experience of test conditions, and that he was a  genuine  student  who
    wished to pursue his studies in the United Kingdom.

28. In respect of the APPG report from 2019, whilst in no way decisive,  it
    does cast material doubts upon the systems  operated  by  EPS  and,  in
    turn, the Respondent in respect of  the  very  serious  allegations  of
    dishonesty  ranged  against  a  large  number  of  individuals.  If  Mr
    Kandola's criticism that the report does not  set  out  of  the  expert
    evidence, thus reducing its overall reliability, is correct then surely
    the same can be said about the  Respondent's  case  here:  the  "expert
    evidence" comprising the analysis of the voice recordings is not before
    me; nor are the recordings themselves.

29. Weighing up all evidential matters  in  this  case,  I  find  that  the
    Respondent has failed to discharge the legal burden of proving that the
    Appellant dishonestly obtained  and  then  used  the  English  language
    certificate in 2013. Given the  seriousness  of  the  allegation  made,
    legal burden can only be discharged by cogent evidence (albeit, on  the
    balance of probabilities and nothing  higher).  Here,  the  Appellant's
    evidence is, when viewed cumulatively, powerful. The Respondent's  case
    finds relatively strong support  in  the  form  of  the  evidence  from
    Project Facade in combination with the cancellation of the  Appellant's
    test results. However, other points taken against the Appellant do  not
    stand up to scrutiny and there is the absence of the  voice  recordings
    themselves, together with any voice analysis thereon. On a highly fact-
    specific assessment, the respondent has not made out her case.  I  find
    that the Appellant has never acted dishonestly. My finding would be the
    same wherever the legal burden rested.

30. On a separate issue, the Appellant has asserted that he never  received
    a notice of liability to removal or a curtailment decision,  issued  by
    the Respondent 3 October 2014. He has accepted that he did  not  inform
    the Respondent of a change of address, assuming that Glyndwr University
    would have done this.  In light of Regulation 7(2) of  the  Immigration
    (Notices) Regulation 2003, I am satisfied  that  once  the  notice  was
    returned to the Respondent on delivered to the Appellant's  last  known
    address (albeit that he was not residing there at  time),  that  notice
    was placed on file and that this constituted service.

31. Given that the Appellant had been granted leave to remain as a  Tier  4
    student from 29 May 2013 until 26 September 2016, the IS.151A notice of
    the more 3 October 2014 must have followed from a curtailment  decision
    of that leave. Unfortunately,  I  have  not  been  provided  with  that
    curtailment decision. Under Article 8ZA(1) and (4) of  the  Immigration
    (Leave to Enter and Remain) Order 2000,  as  amended,  an  unsuccessful
    giving of notice of the curtailment decision to the last known  address
    of the Appellant and the placing of that notice on  file  (which  I  am
    satisfied did in fact occur) constituted good service.

Conclusions

32. The outcome of this particular appeal can of course only be based  upon
    Article 8.

33. I find that the Appellant has established a private life in the  United
    Kingdom over the course of time. Although the  details  of  any  social
    ties and suchlike are thin, the length of time here and his pursuit  of
    studies is sufficient.

34. I am also satisfied that the Respondent's refusal  of  the  Appellant's
    human rights claim constitutes an interference with the private life.

35. Moving straight onto the issue of proportionality, it is clear that the
    Appellant cannot  meet  any  of  the  relevant  Immigration  Rules,  in
    particular paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi). On any view of  the  evidence,  the
    Appellant  would  not  face  "very  significant   obstacles"   to   his
    reintegration into Nepalese society.

36. The real point here is whether my finding on dishonesty  constitutes  a
    feature of sufficient strength to outweigh the general public  interest
    in maintaining effective immigration control  and  the  other  relevant
    considerations under section 117B of the Nationality,  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002, as amended.

37. Mr Kandola has accepted that the Appellant's previous need to remain as
    a student was not curtailed because he (the  Appellant)  had  completed
    his course of studies. He acknowledged that the concession made by  the
    Respondent before the Court of Appeal in Khan would appear to apply  in
    the Appellant's case.

38. Para 37 of Khan includes the following:

           "37. Further, at para. 8 of the note, it was stated:

                 "Nonetheless, for the avoidance of doubt, the SSHD confirms
           that:

                       (i) For those individuals whose leave was  curtailed,
                       and where that leave would still have time to run  as
                       at the date of an FTT determination that there was no
                       deception, subject to any further appeal to  the  UT,
                       the curtailment decision would be withdrawn  and  the
                       effect ... would be that leave would continue and the
                       individuals would not be disadvantaged in any  future
                       application they chose to make;

                       (ii) For those whose leave has  been  curtailed,  and
                       where the leave  would  in  any  event  have  expired
                       without  any  further  application  being  made,  the
                       Respondent will provide a further opportunity for the
                       individuals to obtain leave with  the  safeguards  in
                       paragraph (iii) below.

                 For those whose leave had expired, and who had made  an  in
                 time application for further  leave  to  remain  which  was
                 refused on ETS grounds, the effect of an FTT  determination
                 that there was no deception would be that the refusal would
                 be withdrawn. The applicant in question would still have an
                 outstanding  application  for  leave  to  remain  and   the
                 Respondent will provide them with a reasonable  opportunity
                 to make any further  changes  to  their  application  which
                 would be  considered  on  the  basis  of  them  not  having
                 employed any deception in  the  obtaining  of  their  TOEIC
                 certificate, and they would in no way be  disadvantaged  in
                 any future application they chose to make.

                       (iii) In all cases, the Respondent confirms  that  in
                       making any future  decision  he  will  not  hold  any
                       previous  gap  in  leave  caused  by  any   erroneous
                       decision in relation  to  ETS  against  the  relevant
                       applicant, and will have to take into account all the
                       circumstances of each case."

39. In the Appellant's case it is (ii) that would  seem  to  apply.  As  Mr
    Kandola acknowledged, the Appellant would be entitled  to  a  grant  of
    leave to remain for 60 days during which he could,  if  he  so  wished,
    make an application for further leave to remain as a student (or indeed
    in some other category).

40. I conclude that the erroneous allegation  made  by  the  Respondent  in
    respect of the Appellant's dishonesty is a compelling feature  of  this
    case. The Appellant's  previous  leave  to  remain  as  a  student  was
    curtailed either because it had specifically been alleged he had  acted
    dishonestly in obtaining and submitting a  fraudulent  certificate,  or
    because  they  were  deemed  to  be  systemic  problems  with   Glyndwr
    University's assessment of English language proficiency  in  2014  (the
    reason I cannot be precise as to the basis of the curtailment  is  that
    the Respondent has failed to provide a copy of the notice).  On  either
    basis, the ETS issue played a decisive  role  in  the  curtailment.  In
    light of my findings of fact, the Appellant had never  been  dishonest,
    the force allegation constitutes a compelling feature of this case, and
    the concession made by the Respondent in Khan should apply to him.

41. Any period of leave granted to the Appellant in light of my decision is
    of course a matter for the Respondent.



Anonymity

42. The First-tier Tribunal did not make an anonymity direction.  There  is
    no reason why I should do so and no such direction is made.


Notice of Decision

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside.

The decision is remade and the appeal allowed.

                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. The Appellant appeals to the Upper Tribunal  against  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Kainth ("the judge"), promulgated on 6 August
    2019,  dismissing  the  Appellant's  appeal  against  the  Respondent's
    refusal of his application for leave to remain in  the  United  Kingdom
    (deemed to be a human rights claim), dated 9 January 2019.

 2. The Appellant had arrived in the United Kingdom in  October  2009  with
    leave to enter as a Tier 4 Student. Following a number of extensions in
    the same category, the applicant, as I understand  it,  was  deemed  to
    have become an overstayer from October 2014.  On 26 September  2016  he
    made an application for indefinite leave to remain.   On  9  May  2017,
    this was varied on the basis of human rights, specifically private life
    under Article 8.

 3.  In  refusing  the  human  rights  claim,  the  Respondent  relied   on
    suitability grounds, asserting  that  the  Appellant  had  fraudulently
    obtained  an  English  language  test  certificate  following  a   test
    purportedly taken on 20 March 2013 at South Quay College in London.  It
    was said that following receipt of information from ETS,  it  had  been
    established  that  the  Appellant  had  used  a   proxy   test   taker.
    Consideration was  given  to  Article  8  within  the  context  of  the
    Immigration Rules and without.  It was said that refusal of  the  claim
    would be proportionate.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal

 4. On  appeal  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  the  Appellant  represented
    himself.  He had submitted a bundle of  evidence  including  a  witness
    statement and a  number  of  documents  relating  to  previous  English
    language tests, plus letters from various United  Kingdom  institutions
    regarding his education in this country.

 5. The Respondent had provided what  has  commonly  been  referred  to  as
    "generic evidence" relating to the ETS issue,  together  with  evidence
    from Project Fa�ade relating  to  South  Quay  College,  a  spreadsheet
    concerning the Appellant's test results and the Look-up  Tool  relating
    both to the test taken on the  particular  day  in  question  and  more
    generally.

 6. The judge was satisfied that the Respondent's evidence  discharged  the
    evidential burden resting upon  her.   He  then  went  on  to  consider
    whether or not the Appellant had provided  an  "innocent  explanation".
    The judge considered the Appellant's attempts to contact ETS  regarding
    the  test  results.   He  was  not  satisfied  with   the   Appellant's
    explanation as to why additional contact with ETS  had  not  apparently
    occurred (at least in respect of the evidence adduced on appeal).   The
    judge regarded the Appellant's written and oral evidence as being "more
    generic than specific".

 7. In considering the Respondent's evidence  in  more  detail,  the  judge
    noted the  various  statistics  collected  in  respect  of  South  Quay
    College.  This evidence satisfied the  judge  that  many  of  the  test
    takers had apparently scored significantly higher than that of  genuine
    candidates who had taken the tests  in  at  least  one  other  credible
    educational institution.  The well-known  expert  report  of  Professor
    French was also considered.  Having undertaken this exercise, the judge
    concludes at [36] that the Appellant had failed to provide a  plausible
    and  innocent  explanation  which  satisfied  the  minimum   level   of
    plausibility.  Although the judge did not then state in  terms  (as  he
    should have done) that the  Respondent  had  therefore  discharged  the
    legal burden resting upon her, by default  as  it  were,  it  is  clear
    enough that he was concluding that this had in  effect  been  done  and
    that the Appellant had  practised  deception  when  using  the  English
    language test certificate for an application made on 29 March 2013.

The grounds of appeal and grant of permission

 8. The Appellant, with the assistance of a friend I  assume,  drafted  the
    grounds of appeal.  They are lengthy, but can be summarised as follows:
     first,  it  is  said  that  the  judge  failed  to  consider  relevant
    documentary evidence relating to the Appellant's  pre-existing  ability
    in English language at the time of the test in March 2013; second, that
    the judge failed to adequately  assess  oral  evidence  including  that
    relating to the sending of emails to ETS; third,  that  the  judge  had
    failed to adequately consider a generic report produced by the National
    Union of Students relating to the ETS issue.

 9. In a detailed and considered grant of permission,  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Landes deemed it arguable that the judge had erred in failing  to
    consider the documents relating to pre-existing English ability and  an
    error in the ETS spreadsheet which  had  referred  to  the  Appellant's
    nationality as Gibraltarian rather than Nepalese.  Whilst the other two
    grounds of appeal were deemed to have little if any merit, the grant of
    permission was not restricted.

The hearing

10. I was satisfied  that  the  Appellant  understood  the  nature  of  the
    proceedings and was able to participate fully and fairly.  He explained
    in a little more detail about the email issue, telling me that  he  had
    sent an email to the alternative ETS email address on 12 December 2014.
     He candidly accepted that he was not sure whether evidence of this had
    in fact been before the judge.

11.  Mr  Tufan  acknowledged  that  the  judge  had  not  referred  to  the
    documentation relating to the Appellant's pre-existing English language
    ability and had not dealt with the error in the spreadsheet relating to
    nationality.  However relying on [50], [51] and [57] of MA (ETS - TOEIC
    Testing) [2016] UKUT 00450 (IAC) and the judge's decision as  a  whole,
    he submitted that the omissions were not material.  The judge had  been
    entitled to conclude that the test results had been  invalidated  as  a
    result of the ETS investigations, and he had  been  entitled  to  place
    weight upon the Respondent's evidence relating to South  Quay  College,
    in addition to the report of Professor French.

Error of law decision

12. I conclude that the  judge  has  materially  erred  in  law.   This  is
    specifically in respect of  the  failure  to  have  considered  certain
    relevant documentary evidence at all,  namely  the  IELTS  certificates
    dated  7  August  2009  and  3  November  2011,  together  with   other
    accompanying relevant documents which clearly went to the issue of  the
    Appellant's pre-existing English language ability at the  time  of  the
    controversial test on 20 March 2013.

13. Both of the certificates, one obtained whilst the Appellant  was  still
    in Nepal and the other when he was in  the  United  Kingdom,  gave  his
    speaking score as 6.0.  These test results (which  have  not  been  the
    subject of any challenge at any stage as far as I am  aware)  had  both
    been relied upon in order to obtain enrolment onto various  courses  in
    the United Kingdom.  On their face  they  clearly  indicated  a  fairly
    strong proficiency in English  language,  particularly  in  respect  of
    speaking.  They were before the judge and  in  my  view  they  required
    specific consideration in the context of the evidence as a whole.

14. Mr Tufan is fully entitled to rely  on  MA  and  the  proposition  that
    people with good English language  ability  may  nonetheless  cheat  in
    tests for a variety of reasons.  That is undoubtedly a factor that  has
    to be grappled with in cases such as this.  However, that can  only  be
    done fairly and properly if all relevant evidence  is  considered.   In
    this case an important aspect of that evidence has  been  left  out  of
    account.  It is not to say that specific consideration of this evidence
    would inevitably have led to a different outcome, but the  certificates
    carry with them sufficient  potential  weight  to  render  the  judge's
    failure to consider them not simply an error, but a material error.

15. As the error goes to the issue of the English language test and in turn
    the Appellant's honesty, I see no other  alternative  but  to  set  the
    judge's decision aside.



Disposal

16. This appeal will be retained  in  the  Upper  Tribunal  and  a  resumed
    hearing held before me in due course.

17. At the next hearing, I will  receive  oral  evidence  on  all  relevant
    matters. In particular, I  will  consider  the  issue  of  the  English
    language test in 2013 and the  Appellant's  Article  8  claim.  I  give
    directions to the parties,  below.  The  Appellant  should  read  these
    carefully.




Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains an error of law and is  set
aside.

The appeal is adjourned for a resumed hearing.



Directions to the parties

   1) The Appellant shall send any  further  evidence  (including  documents
      concerning any emails sent to and received  from  ETS)  to  the  Upper
      Tribunal and the Respondent no later than 25 January 2020;



   2) Any further evidence from the Respondent shall be sent  to  the  Upper
      Tribunal and the Appellant no later than 25 January 2020.
