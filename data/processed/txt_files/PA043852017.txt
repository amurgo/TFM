For the Appellant:     Mr E MacKay, of McGlashan MacKay, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals against a decision by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Farrelly, promulgated on 22 August 2017.  She  now  pursues  article  8
    grounds only.

 2. The first and main point in the grounds is that there was  no  evidence
    to justify the  finding  of  no  subsisting  relationship  between  the
    appellant and her husband.

 3. Mr Matthews correctly pointed out that the decision  at  ï¿½29  states  3
    reasons: "limited evidence available"; the parties  continued  to  live
    apart even after they were both living in Glasgow;  and  evidence  from
    witnesses from a shelter was "historical".

 4. In course of submissions, and on reference to the evidence, however, Mr
    Matthews acknowledged that the evidence was not as limited as  appeared
    from the decision, and that the witnesses spoke not only to the  period
    some years ago when the appellant made use of a shelter, but to  recent
    times; and that while reasoning was not absent,  it  was  difficult  to
    argue that it was adequate.

 5. The one reason which survives scrutiny is that the parties continued to
    live apart at a period when they gave no good reason for doing so.   Mr
    MacKay suggested that was due to accommodation providers not permitting
    co-occupation, but that is unsubstantiated and unlikely.  (There  might
    be an economic motive which is less creditable to the appellant and her
    partner, but which does not exclude a relationship; but this is not the
    time to speculate further.)

 6. The judge accepted that the relationship subsisted until  a  couple  of
    months before  the  hearing,  and  that  the  appellant  was  pregnant;
    apparently with her husband's child, which the judge  appears  also  to
    accept.  That did not exclude a finding of no subsisting  relationship,
    but it would take more than the one reason which survives  scrutiny  to
    justify it.

 7. The decision of the FtT is set aside. It stands only  as  a  record  of
    what was said at the hearing.

 8. Parties agreed that  the  nature  of  the  case  is  such  that  it  is
    appropriate in terms of section 12(2)(b)(i) of  the  2007  Act  and  of
    Practice Statement 7.2 to remit the case to the  FtT  for  an  entirely
    fresh hearing.

 9. The member(s) of the FtT chosen to consider the case are not to include
    Judge Farrelly.

10. The FtT made an anonymity direction.  The matter was not  addressed  in
    the UT.  Anonymity has been maintained herein.

11. Parties also agreed that so far  as  practicable  the  case  should  be
    listed to be heard along with  a  pending  appeal  by  the  appellant's
    husband, case reference HU/13895/2017.
