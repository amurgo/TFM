                            DECISION AND REASONS

Pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008  I
make an order prohibiting  the  disclosure  or  publication  of  any  matter
likely to lead members of the public to identify the  appellant.  Breach  of
this order can be punished as  a  contempt  of  court.  I  make  this  order
because this is framed as a protection case and there is invariably  a  risk
in cases of this kind that publicity will itself create a risk.

This is an appeal against a decision of the First-tier Tribunal  (First-tier
Tribunal Judge Veloso) dismissing the appellant's appeal against a  decision
of the Secretary of  State  on  13  November  2015  refusing  the  appellant
international protection and leave to remain on human rights grounds.

At paragraph 5 of the decision Judge Veloso set out the  parameters  of  the
appeal.  The letters "DL" mean discretionary leave. Judge Veloso said:

  "Mr Smyth confirmed that the appellant's case was that he was entitled to
  further DL  in  line  with  the  respondent's  policy.   His  rights  and
  entitlement came under the DL policy, not the Immigration Rules.  He  was
  not arguing asylum, humanitarian protection or Article 3  ECHR.   He  was
  arguing  Article  8  only  on  the  basis  of  the  application  of   the
  respondent's DL policy."

This is a case where there is considerable potential to become  bogged  down
with side issues and I am grateful to Mr Smyth for avoiding  a  scatter  gun
approach, which may have taken a great deal of time but  would  have  caused
only irritation, and concentrating on  the  point  that  most  assisted  the
appellant.

This appeal has previously  been  determined  unsatisfactorily.  An  earlier
decision to allow the appeal on a limited  basis  was  set  aside  by  Upper
Tribunal Judge H Storey because the  law  had  changed  and  the  First-tier
Tribunal had no power to make the decision that it did.  For  all  that  the
closing passage of the unsatisfactory decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
does explain what the appeal is about.  There the judge said:

  "It is unclear to me why  the  appellant  has  been  given  three  years'
  discretionary leave following the decision promulgated in  February  2012
  rather than six months until the appellant was 17�.  That would have been
  in accordance with the respondent's policy at the time  (as  set  out  in
  paragraph 17 above).  Rather than allowing the appeal on the basis of the
  Appellant's skeleton argument and submissions,  or  refusing  it  on  the
  basis of the refusal letter and the Presenting Officer's  submissions,  I
  direct that this case should be remitted to the  Secretary  of  State  so
  that  the  application  can  be  reconsidered  in  the   light   of   the
  documentation produced for the hearing,  the  respondent's  previous  and
  current policies and in particular an explanation as to why the appellant
  was granted three years' discretionary leave rather than six months (till
  he became 17�) following the hearing promulgated on  6th  February  2012.
  It should also be made clear to in the reconsideration letter whether the
  three-year discretionary leave reflected the fact  that  the  application
  was on the grounds of private life as well as on his being a  minor.   If
  the application remains unsuccessful on  reconsideration,  the  appellant
  will retain a right of appeal."

The point is that the appellant entered the United Kingdom in  2009  he  was
given  discretionary  leave  of  three  years  but  the  letter  giving  him
discretionary leave in 2012 did not explain the basis of the  grant.   There
was a policy identified as the 2015 discretionary leave policy which  showed
that  the  maximum  period  of  discretionary  leave  was  three  years  and
"caseworkers must consider whether the circumstances prevailing at the  time
of the original grant of leave continue  at  the  date  of  decision."   The
policy continues: "If the circumstances  remain  the  same,  the  individual
does not fall  within  the  restricted  leave  policy  and  the  criminality
thresholds do not apply, a further  period  of  three  years  [discretionary
leave] should normally be granted."

Judge Veloso was satisfied that although she saw a document dated  2015  the
material parts of the policy in 2012 were the same and  that  the  appellant
was given three years' discretionary leave rather than  six  months  because
he was still a minor and entitled to three years' leave  under  the  policy.
The grant of  discretionary  leave  was  made  on  4  April  2012  when  the
appellant was still only 17 years of  age.   The  letter  telling  him  that
discretionary leave had been granted does  not  explain  the  decision.   It
merely announces it and explains his rights.

In the "detailed reasons  for  refusal"  accompanying  the  decision  of  13
November 2015 the respondent said at paragraph 23:

  "Careful attention has been given to the wording that removing you  would
  "at this stage" interfere with your right to respect for a private  life.
  I have considered that it is also reliant upon your being a minor, a time
  when best interests including maintaining education and social care.   At
  the time of this promulgation you were 17 years and one month  old.   You
  are now 20 years and 10 months old."

The reference to "the wording" is a reference to  the  reasons  given  by  a
First-tier Tribunal Judge for allowing an earlier appeal.

In other words, in her letter of November 2015 the respondent said that  the
appellant had been given leave following the  judge's  decision  because  of
his  minority  and  because  of  things  in  his  private  and  family  life
associated with that minority included his being  in  social  care  and  his
being in education.  The letter explained that he is now  an  adult  and  he
was no longer in social care and was no  longer  in  education  and  was  no
longer a minor  and  these  were  sufficiently  different  circumstances  to
warrant his being refused further leave.

In his skeleton argument prepared for the hearing Mr Smyth  says  that  this
finding of "significant changes" is irrational because there is  nothing  in
the earlier decisions of 4 April 2012 or 13 November 2015 to  indicate  that
the changes identified were  changes  in  circumstances  that  had  had  any
bearing on the grant of leave to remain.

Judge Veloso  had  found  at  paragraph  51  that  the  significant  changes
included  his  not  receiving  public  funds  and  his  not  continuing  his
education and neither of these  things  had  been  relied  upon.   Mr  Smyth
argued that Judge Veloso was  irrational  to  say  that  these  things  were
relevant.  He said there had  been  no  significant  changes  and  therefore
under the terms of the policy his leave should have been renewed.

Although this is in some ways helpfully clear  I  find  that  this  skeleton
argument exposes the error in the  appellant's  submissions.   Judge  Veloso
was not asking herself if the decision is  "in  accordance  with  the  law".
That was a ground of appeal that is no longer permissible and it is  failing
to appreciate that that caused the appeal to  be  determined  unsuccessfully
on an earlier occasion.  Judge Veloso was conducting an Article 8  balancing
exercise.  Clearly she was addressing her mind to proportionality  and  what
is proportionate is illuminated but not determined by what is  said  in  the
Rules or policy.  This is the point the  Tribunal  was  trying  to  make  in
Mostafa (Article 8 in entry clearance) [2015] UKUT 112  (IAC).   Here  Judge
Veloso was having to decide if refusing further leave  was  a  proportionate
interference with the private and family life of this claimant.  She had  in
her mind the Rules (it is common ground that the  appellant  cannot  satisfy
the Rules) and the appropriate  policies.   However  Judge  Veloso  was  not
concerned with the correct application of the policy  by  the  Secretary  of
State but with whether the terms of the policy impacted  on  the  Article  8
balancing exercise.  She was entitled to note that a change of  circumstance
could prevent renewal under the policy and  it  is  immaterial  whether  the
Secretary of State noticed or explained such  a  change.   Her  decision  is
that there was a change of circumstance and  that  is  consistent  with  the
policy and it is therefore on the facts of this case it cannot be said  that
her decision was inconsistent with the policy or otherwise  unlawful.   This
is precisely the point identified  by  Mr  P  Nath,  a  Senior  Home  Office
Presenting Officer who prepared the Rule 24 response.  He said at  paragraph
3:

  "If the matter was not raised in the  SSHD  refusal,  the  FTJ  is  still
  entitled to raise this issue and open to make the above findings."

Having reflected on the submissions made by  both  parties  I  am  satisfied
that Mr Nath  was  absolutely  right.   This  is  a  case  where  the  judge
correctly conducted a balancing exercise, considered proportionality in  the
light of policies and made her own findings and her own findings  were  that
the facts of the  case,  consistent  with  the  policy,  showed  significant
changes which meant removal was no longer an unlawful interference with  the
private and family life of the appellant.

It follows therefore that  the  appeal  against  the  First-tier  Tribunal's
decision is dismissed.

Decision

I dismissed the appellant's appeal.
