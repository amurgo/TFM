                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. The Secretary of State appeals to the Upper Tribunal from the decision
      of the First-tier Tribunal allowing the claimant's appeal against  the
      decision of the Secretary of State to remove him  in  accordance  with
      Section 10 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 as a person who  had
      used deception in seeking leave to  remain,  his  human  rights  claim
      (leave to remain as a spouse of a person  present  and  settled  here)
      having been refused by reference to paragraphs 287 and 322(1A) of  the
      Rules, and under Appendix FM.  The First-tier Tribunal did not make an
      anonymity direction, and I do not consider that the claimant  requires
      anonymity for these proceedings in the Upper Tribunal.

The Reasons for Granting Permission to Appeal

   2. On 5 May 2015 Upper Tribunal Judge Kekic granted permission to  appeal
      for the following reasons:
         It is arguable that in finding the claimant had not used  deception
         to  obtain  his  English  language  test  certificate,  the   judge
         disregarded  the  fact  that  ETS  themselves  had  identified  the
         claimant as having made use of a proxy test taker and that  had  he
         had  regard  to  the  specific  evidence  along  with  the  witness
         statements outlining  the  investigative  process,  he  would  have
         reached a different decision.  The grounds may all be argued.

The Hearing Before, the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

   3. The claimant's appeal came before Judge  Narayan  sitting  at  Bennett
      House, Stoke on 14 November 2014.  Ms Manning of Counsel  appeared  on
      behalf of the claimant, and the Secretary of State was represented  by
      a Home Office Presenting Officer.  The claimant gave evidence  through
      a Mandarin interpreter.  He had sat the English language speaking  and
      listening test on 17 September 2013, and his test score  was  genuine.
      When he got to the college, he was met  by  a  member  of  staff.   He
      showed the person his passport and that person  checked  the  claimant
      was the person in the passport.  He was taken to sit  in  front  of  a
      computer, it was then turned on, and the claimant then  keyed  in  his
      full name and date of birth.  After the exam, a photograph  was  taken
      of him by a member of staff.  The Presenting Officer did not  put  any
      questions to the claimant in cross-examination.

   4. In her closing submissions on behalf of the respondent, the Presenting
      Officer relied on the documents in  the  Home  Office  bundle.   These
      included generic witness statements from Rebecca  Collings  and  Peter
      Millington.  She submitted that the evidence showed that the  claimant
      did not take the test, and it was taken by someone else.

   5. On behalf of the claimant, Ms Manning  submitted  that  there  was  no
      evidence as to how or why the test that the claimant had sat had  been
      subsequently  characterised  as  invalid.   The  documentary  evidence
      relied on by the Presenting Officer had not been verified or  sourced.
      The allegations set out in paragraph 8 of the refusal letter  had  not
      been authenticated.

   6. In his subsequent decision, the judge noted the  evidence  of  Rebecca
      Collings that ETS described any test categorised as  cancelled  (which
      later became known as invalid) had the same voice  for  multiple  test
      takers.  He found that there was no evidence before him  from  ETS  to
      show that the test on 17 September 2013 had  been  taken  by  a  proxy
      tester rather than by the claimant.

   7. He noted the evidence of Peter Middleton where he stated that of  over
      33,000 possible matches identified by the system, 80%  were  confirmed
      after human verification.  He held that there was no  evidence  before
      him that the claimant's test did not fall into the category of the 20%
      which was not confirmed after human verification.

   8. He concluded from all  the  evidence  and  the  submissions  that  the
      Secretary of State had not discharged the burden of  proof.   She  had
      not shown that the information provided by ETS in respect of the  test
      taken by the claimant on 17 September 2013 revealed an anomaly in  his
      speaking test, indicating the presence of  a  proxy  test  taker.   He
      therefore accepted the claimant's evidence, and found that he did take
      the test.  He thereby qualified under the Immigration Rules in respect
      of his claim for indefinite leave to remain as a spouse of  a  British
      national.  An additional reason for  accepting  the  evidence  of  the
      claimant was that he had given his evidence emphatically  and  he  had
      made  his  position  known  to  the  Home  Office  early  on  in   the
      proceedings.  So it was open to the Secretary  of  State,  if  she  so
      wished, to obtain focused and relevant  evidence  in  respect  of  the
      claimant's assertion that he genuinely took the test on  17  September
      2013.

The Error of Law Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

   9. The hearing in March 2016 took place against the background of reports
      on social media of a judgment handed down  by  the  President  of  the
      Upper Tribunal in SM and Ihsan Qadir v Secretary of State for the Home
      Department.  (In fact the judgment had not been handed down,  but  had
      been circulated in draft to the parties for comment. The judgment  was
      not promulgated until 5 April 2016. It has since been reported  as  SM
      and Qadir v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department  (ETS -
      Evidence - Burden of Proof) [2016] UKUT 00229 (IAC)).

  10. SM and Qadir are test cases on the  reliability  and  cogency  of  the
      generic evidence relied upon by the Secretary of State in ETS cases in
      a statutory appeal context.  Ms Manning informed me (based on  reports
      carried in social media) that Mr Qadir and  the  other  appellant  had
      been successful in their appeals.

  11. Ms Manning and Mr  Wilding  were  in  agreement  that  the  successful
      outcome of these test cases was not dispositive of the  appeal  before
      me.  They agreed that the outcome was likely to have a bearing on  the
      remaking of the decision, if an error of law  was  established.   They
      were content that I should hear argument on the error of law question,
      and if I decided that the decision should be set aside and remade, the
      remaking should be postponed to a date far enough ahead  so  that  the
      parties could consider the implications of  the  test  case  outcomes,
      once the decisions were reported.

  12. Mr Wilding submitted that the evidence  relied  upon  was  capable  of
      discharging the burden of proof, as was effectively indicated  by  the
      President in the judicial review case of Gazi.  He submitted that  the
      judge had not given adequate reasons for his findings on the Secretary
      of State's evidence.

  13. Ms Manning submitted the judge had given adequate reasons for allowing
      the appeal, not least because  the  judge  had  also  drawn  upon  the
      evidence of the claimant in rebuttal of allegation of deception.



Reasons for Finding an Error of Law

  14. There is a clear error in the judge's reasoning in paragraph [27].  At
      the beginning  of  the  paragraph,  he  notes  the  specific  evidence
      provided by ETS that the claimant's test results had been declared  by
      them to be invalid.  Later on in the  same  paragraph,  he  notes  the
      evidence  of  Rebecca  Collings  that  ETS  described  that  any  test
      categorised as cancelled, which later became known as invalid, had the
      same voice for multiple test takers.  The judge appears  not  to  have
      understood the import of the two pieces of evidence as cited above, as
      he concluded at the end of paragraph [27] there was no evidence before
      him as to the information that had been provided by ETS as to the test
      of 17 September 2013 being taken  by  a  proxy  tester,  and  not  the
      claimant.  In fact, the two pieces of evidence to which he had earlier
      referred did precisely that which he said had not been done, which was
      to explain the significance  of  the  claimant's  test  results  being
      categorised as invalid.

  15. A further misunderstanding of the evidence is apparent in the  judge's
      reasoning in paragraph [28].  He misunderstood the  evidential  import
      of Mr Middleton's statement  that  of  over  33,000  possible  matches
      identified by the system, 80% were confirmed after human verification.
       That meant that the initial matching process  conducted  by  computer
      was 80% accurate, assuming no human  error  in  the  subsequent  human
      verification process.  Mr Middleton was not saying that there was only
      an 80% accuracy rate after human verification had  taken  place.   The
      witness  statement  evidence  made  it  clear  that  a  test  was  not
      characterised as invalid unless the apparent match with the same voice
      was confirmed after human verification.  So the  judge  was  wrong  to
      speculate that  the  claimant's  test  results  might  fall  into  the
      category of the 20% of cases which  were  not  confirmed  after  human
      verification.

  16. The errors in the judge's line  of  reasoning  fatally  undermine  the
      conclusion he reaches at the beginning  of  paragraph  [30]  that  the
      Secretary of State has not discharged the  burden  of  proof,  and  in
      particular has not shown that ETS has  provided  information  that  an
      anomaly with the claimant's speaking test indicates the presence of  a
      proxy test taker.  ETS has provided this information.

  17. After pronouncing that the Secretary of State has not  discharged  the
      burden of proof, the judge continues as follows:
         I therefore accept the [claimant's] evidence and find that  he  did
         take the test...

  18. Accordingly, prime  facie,  the  judge  is  accepting  the  claimant's
      evidence because the Home Office has  not  discharged  the  burden  of
      proving that he did not take the speaking test.

  19. While I accept that the judge goes on to give an additional reason for
      accepting the claimant's evidence in rebuttal, which was that he  gave
      his evidence emphatically, I do not consider this makes his conclusion
      a sustainable one.  Similarly, the fact that  the  Presenting  Officer
      did not cross-examine the claimant on his  denial  of  deception  also
      does  not  salvage  the  decision,  which  is  squarely  based  on   a
      misunderstanding of  the  Secretary  of  State's  evidence,  with  the
      consequence that the chain of reasoning is highly flawed.

 Conclusion

  20. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained  an  error  of  law,
      such that it must be set aside and remade.

Observations on impact of SM and Qadir on Error of Law Ruling

  21. Before promulgating my error of law decision, I reviewed the  decision
      in SM and Qadir for two purposes. The first was to check  whether  its
      findings undermined my error of law analysis and  the  second  was  to
      look for guidance on future disposal.

  22. Of particular significance are the following passages in the decision:


         68.  As our analysis and conclusions in the  immediately  preceding
         section make clear, we  have  substantial  reservations  about  the
         strength and quality of the Secretary  of  State's  evidence.   Its
         shortcomings are manifest. On the other hand, while bearing in mind
         that the context is one of alleged deception, we must be mindful of
         the comparatively  modest  threshold  which  an  evidential  burden
         entails. This calls for an evaluative assessment on the part of the
         tribunal. By an admittedly narrow margin we are satisfied that  the
         Secretary of State has discharged this burden.  The effect of  this
         is that there  is  a  burden,  again  an  evidential  one,  on  the
         Appellants of raising an innocent explanation.
         ...
         78.  The events of 2012 are of  obvious  significance.   The  TOEIC
         Certificate was, on its face, obtained by this Appellant [SM] after
         undergoing the necessary testing on two separate dates, 20  and  26
         March 2012.  We acknowledge that, in the abstract, his score in the
         modules of listening and reading is very high indeed, being 930 out
         of a possible 990 (circa 90%).  In  the  modules  of  speaking  and
         writing the scores recorded are also high, being  160/200  in  each
         instance (circa 80%).  Duly armed with his TOEIC Certificate,  this
         Appellant applied for leave to remain in the United  Kingdom.   His
         application was refused, giving rise to a hearing before the First-
         tier Tribunal ("FtT") on 05 September 2012.
         79.  We consider  this  aspect  of  the  evidence  to  be  of  some
         significance.  From the Tribunal's determination  one  learns  that
         this Appellant attended  the  hearing,  gave  evidence,  was  cross
         examined and was re-examined. No interpreter was required and there
         is no indication of the slightest difficulty  in  communication  or
         comprehension.   We  note  further  that  during  the   period   of
         (approximately) September 2010  to  February  2012  this  Appellant
         claims that he was pursuing courses at two colleges simultaneously,
         which we accept.   We  infer  from  this  fact,  coupled  with  the
         successful outcomes, that his mastery of English was of a high  and
         progressively improving level.
         80.  We consider that in appeals of this nature  evidence  of  this
         kind is likely to be of substantially  greater  force  and  cogency
         than the  tribunal's  own  assessment  of  an  appellant's  English
         language proficiency based on performance at  the  appeal  hearing.
         This is especially pertinent in the present case, given  that  some
         three years have  elapsed  since  this  Appellant  claims  to  have
         secured his TOEIC certificate. In some of the FtT decisions in this
         field one finds observations concerning  the  appellant's  apparent
         fluency in, and command of, the English language.  We consider that
         Judges should be cautious in adopting this approach  for  at  least
         three reasons.  The first is the passage of time.   The  second  is
         that Judges are not language testing or linguistics  experts.   The
         third is that,  to  date,  there  has  been  no  expert  linguistic
         evidence in any of these cases.
         ...
         101. We have already held  that  the  evidential  burden  of  proof
         resting on the Secretary of State  has  been  narrowly  discharged.
         For the reasons which we have given, we  are  satisfied  that  both
         Appellants have discharged their  burden  of  raising  an  innocent
         explanation of the prima facie indications of  deception  on  their
         part  in  the  Secretary  of  State's  evidence.  For  the  reasons
         elaborated, we conclude, without hesitation, that the Secretary  of
         State has failed to establish, on  the  balance  of  probabilities,
         that the Appellants' prima facie innocent explanations  are  to  be
         rejected. The legal burden of proof falling  on  the  Secretary  of
         State has not been discharged. The Appellants are clear winners.

  23. The findings do not undermine my error of law analysis as, despite its
      shortcomings, the generic evidence coupled with the specific  evidence
      of the appellants' tests being declared  invalid  narrowly  discharged
      the burden of proof. So, as in the test cases, the  burden  shifts  to
      the claimant to provide an innocent explanation. As the claimant  gave
      his evidence in Mandarin, and he did not apparently rely  on  external
      sources of evidence  to  show  that  he  had  the  level  of  language
      proficiency shown in his  TOEIC  certificate,  the  lack  of  adequate
      reasoning underpinning the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  is
      clearly material.

Directions for the Resumed Hearing to Remake the Decision

  24. I directed that there would be a further hearing before me  to  remake
      the decision, with a time estimate of one and a half hours.

  25. I gave both parties permission to adduce evidence that was not  before
      the First-tier Tribunal, provided that such evidence was contained  in
      a paginated and indexed bundle and served on each  other  and  on  the
      Upper Tribunal no less than seven days before the resumed hearing.

The Resumed Hearing on 2 August 2016

26. In advance of the resumed hearing, the claimant's  solicitors  informed
    the Tribunal that the claimant was going to be unrepresented.

27. He gave his evidence through a Mandarin interpreter.  I took it as read
    that he adopted as  his  evidence-in-chief  the  same  lengthy  witness
    statement dated 8 October 2014 which he had relied on before the First-
    tier Tribunal.  I asked him whether he was seeking to rely on  any  new
    evidence, and he produced the City and Guilds certificates referred  to
    in paragraph 20 of his witness statement.  These showed that on 4  July
    2014 he had passed an ESOL skills for life test at entry level  3,  and
    Mr Mills confirmed from a Google  search  that  this  showed  that  his
    knowledge of English as of that date was up to B1 CEFR level.

28. In paragraph 20 of his witness statement,  the  claimant  said  he  had
    followed a five week course in which he had to attend classes on  three
    days each week before he sat this test in July 2014.

29. Mr Mills cross-examined the claimant on his witness  statement  and  on
    the new evidence relied on by the  Secretary  of  State  which  he  had
    handed up at the outset.  The new evidence comprised a report  entitled
    "Project fa�ade - criminal inquiry into abuse of the TOEIC" relating to
    Stamford College, London; and a print-out headed ETS TOEIC test  centre
    lock-up tool setting out the status of all tests taken on 17  September
    2013 at Stamford College.  The  report  dated  15  May  2015  had  been
    prepared  by  Detective  Inspector  Andrew  Carter,  a  member  of  the
    Immigration Enforcement Criminal and Financial  Investigation  Team  at
    the Home Office. He stated that a criminal inquiry at Stamford  College
    in London had revealed  the  following:  between  15  May  2012  and  5
    February 2014, Stamford College had undertaken 1,446 TOEIC speaking and
    writing tests of which ETS identified the following:
           . Invalid 843.
           . Questionable 603.
           . Not withdrawn (no evidence of invalidity) 0.
           . Percentage invalid 58%.

30. Mr  Carter  continued  at  paragraph  12  to  say  that  the  following
    information, although not  covering  the  entire  testing  period,  was
    provided in support of and to corroborate the analysis completed by ETS
    to show the "organised and widespread" abuse of  the  TOEIC  that  took
    place at this test centre.

31. Earlier in the report, DI Carter drew a comparison with  secure  public
    test centres overseen by ETS  global  employees.   The  following  test
    figures were recorded between 11 April 2011 and 9 February 2014 at  the
    public  test  centres  in  Bloomsbury  and  Westminster.   1,039  TOEIC
    speaking and writing tests were undertaken of which ETS identified  the
    following:
           . Invalid 3.
           . Questionable 0.
           . Not withdrawn (no evidence of invalidity) 1,036.
           . Percentage invalid 0.28%.

32. In comparison the level of cheating found that the majority of  private
    test centres was significant.

33. The results for 17 September 2013 showed that a total of 35 tests  were
    taken.  The number of tests that were released  (not  withdrawn  as  no
    evidence of invalidity) was zero.  Fifty per cent  of  the  tests  were
    questionable and 43% (fifteen out of thirty  five)  were  found  to  be
    invalid.  The average test scores in speaking were 179.1.

34. In his witness statement at paragraph 5 the claimant said that  he  had
    taken the speaking and writing test at Stamford College on 17 September
    2013, and that he  had  sat  for  listening  and  reading  test  on  20
    September 2013.  He had passed these examinations "with self-study  and
    without tuition," thus proving that he met the required B1 level of the
    CEFR for languages to be granted ILR as the spouse of a person  present
    and settled in the UK.

35. The claimant was cross-examined as to why he had  chosen  to  take  the
    test  at  Stamford  College.   He  confirmed  that  he  was  living  in
    Nottingham at the time.  He was asked why therefore he had gone to take
    the test at a college in London.  He said there were no test centres in
    Nottingham.  He had found Stamford College on  the  internet.   It  was
    just a coincidence that the test centre which  he  had  chosen  was  in
    London.  He saw the school was good, so he chose to go to that  school.
    Also, he had not been to London before and he wanted to  visit  London.
    It was put to him that Stamford College had a reputation  as  somewhere
    where he could use a proxy (as evidenced by the findings  in  paragraph
    11 of the Project Fa�ade report) and that was why he had chosen  to  go
    there.  Someone had told him that he could use a proxy at this college?
     The appellant denied this.  It was put to him that the  way  that  the
    system worked was that the candidate would log onto  the  computer  and
    then stand up and move aside while the pilot took over.  The  appellant
    said he did not see this happen.  The room he was in  was  very  small.
    There were only about ten people there.  He did not see anyone using  a
    pilot.  He had to put his passport on the table to  show  that  he  was
    taking an exam, and then his mobile telephone was taken away before  he
    began the exam.

36. He was asked why, if he could speak English at the level shown  in  the
    TOEIC certificate in September 2013, he was using an interpreter  three
    years later to give his evidence?  He said that the tests were based on
    guidelines and focus points in a particular area.  He had  familiarised
    himself with this particular area before taking the test.

37. In answer to questions for clarification purposes from me, the claimant
    said it was not a case of him not being able to go back to  China,  but
    his wife would really miss being here.  She  liked  the  weather  here.
    She also thought the food here was up to proper hygiene standards. Both
    of them had had unfortunate pasts.  He had given up 38 years of work in
    order to be with her in the UK.

38. The claimant's wife, Mrs  Chen,  who  was  sitting  behind  him  became
    visibly distressed during this part of the claimant's evidence,  and  I
    asked her if she wished to give evidence as well.  She answered in  the
    affirmative, and she confirmed that what she  had  said  in  her  short
    witness statement dated 8 October 2014 was correct.  In  her  statement
    she agreed with everything said by her husband in his longer statement.

39. In answer to questions for clarification purposes from me, she said she
    had come to the United Kingdom in 1998 to see her sister.  Later on she
    had bought a shop.  She had got leave to remain in the year  2000,  and
    not long afterwards she had become naturalised as  a  British  citizen.
    (It is accepted by the Home Office that she  became  naturalised  as  a
    British citizen in 2005).

40. She had known the claimant for a long time, and they had  got  together
    after the claimant's first wife passed away in 2006.  She had gone back
    to China to marry him in 2009.  Her son had been born in China in 1987.
     He came to the UK when he was 10 years old, and his father remained in
    China.  He too was now a British citizen.  Mr Mills declined to ask the
    claimant's wife any questions.

41. In his closing submissions on behalf of  the  Secretary  of  State,  Mr
    Mills submitted that the Secretary of State had made out her case  that
    the claimant had obtained his TOEIC test certificate by deception.   He
    acknowledged that the ESOL test was taken  not  long  after  the  TOEIC
    test.  But the TOEIC test result was high, 180 out  of  200,  and  this
    suggested a very good level of proficiency  in  English.   It  was  not
    clear that the level achieved in the subsequent ESOL test was  as  good
    as the TOEIC test result.  In addition, it was very surprising that  he
    was choosing to use an interpreter now.  Following the decision of  the
    Court of Appeal in Secretary of State for the Home Department  and  (1)
    Mohammed Shehzad and (2) MD Chowdhury [2016] EWCA Civ 615 at paragraphs
    [21] to [26], the evidential burden  of  the  Secretary  of  State  was
    satisfied, and it was then incumbent on the individual whose leave  had
    been curtailed to provide evidence  in  response  raising  an  innocent
    explanation.  Here the claimant had  provided  a  very  weak  rebuttal.
    This was the real explanation as to why he had gone to London  to  take
    the test rather than taking it at a college local to Nottingham.

42. If I accepted that the Secretary of State had made out her case on  the
    use of deception, and hence a failure on the claimant's  part  to  meet
    the suitability requirement, the claimant would only  be  eligible  for
    Article 8 relief outside the Rules.  Given his use  of  deception,  the
    public interest in his removal was considerable.   However,  he  agreed
    with me that the claimant would not be the subject of a ten year ban on
    re-entry as envisaged by him in his witness  statement.   It  would  be
    open to him to seek entry clearance  to  return  as  the  spouse  of  a
    British citizen. Mr  Mills  submitted  that  the  outcome  of  such  an
    application would be a matter of discretion  for  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer, applying Rule 320(11).

43. In reply, the claimant said that Mr Mills had talked of fraud,  and  he
    felt really pained by his allegations.  He swore by the Queen  that  he
    did not defraud the system.  He had attended the test centre on the two
    days in question.  He did not use somebody  else  to  do  the  speaking
    test.  He had taken the ESOL test at a test centre in Sheffield.  There
    was also a test centre in Nottingham, but it was more convenient to  go
    to Sheffield as there were road works by the test centre in Nottingham.

Discussion and Findings on Re-making

44. As previously noted, the case of SM Qadir is now  reported  as  SM  and
    Ihsan Qadir v Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2016]  UKUT
    229 (IAC).  This case was considered by the Court of Appeal in  Shehzad
    and Chowdhury cited by Mr Mills.

45. The significance of the Court of Appeal's decision for present purposes
    is that it confirms my initial observations on the ratio  decidendi  of
    SM and Qadir as set out in paragraph 23 above.  In short,  despite  the
    shortcomings in the generic evidence identified by the Tribunal  in  SM
    and Qadir,  and  despite  the  criticisms  of  such  evidence  made  by
    Professor Harrison, the combination of (a) the generic evidence and (b)
    the specific evidence of an individual claimant's tests being  declared
    invalid narrowly discharges the evidential burden of proof.  So, as  in
    the test cases, the burden  shifts  to  this  claimant  to  provide  an
    innocent explanation.

46. The Secretary of State has fortified the case against the  claimant  by
    deploying specific evidence that Stamford College is one of  apparently
    21 test centres around the country that  has  been  prioritised  for  a
    criminal investigation as a result of a  number  of  factors  including
    high  test  volumes,  audits  that  highlighted  cheating   and   other
    intelligence and information that indicated  widespread  abuse  of  the
    exam; and  that  the  ongoing  criminal  investigation  in  respect  of
    Stamford College in particular has  shown  that  80%  of  speaking  and
    writing tests taken at the college between 15 May 2012 and  5  February
    2014 were found to be invalid.  It would also appear that the  claimant
    is one of fifteen test takers on 17 September 2013 whose speaking  (and
    writing) test has been found to be invalid.

47. It does not appear that the new evidence was served seven  days  before
    the resumed hearing, in accordance with my directions,  but  I  do  not
    consider that the claimant was prejudiced by its late  introduction.  I
    do not consider that having sight of  the  report  seven  days  earlier
    would have made any difference to how he would have prepared to present
    to his case.

48. Although the claimant  initially  asserted  that  there  were  no  test
    centres in Nottingham, he later volunteered the information that  there
    was a test centre in Nottingham where he could have sat the ESOL  test.
    So his credibility is undermined by the fact that he travelled all  the
    way to London to take the test at a centre where there  was  widespread
    abuse of the test, including the use of pilots or proxy test takers  in
    over 50% of cases.

49. According to the TOEIC certificate in  respect  of  the  speaking  test
    taken on 17 September 2013, the claimant achieved a score of 180 out of
    200.  This puts him at the top of level 7, which has a score  range  of
    160 to 180.  The explanatory rubric says that typically test takers  at
    level 7 can create connected sustained  discourse  appropriate  to  the
    typical workplace.  They can express opinions or respond to complicated
    requests effectively in extended responses.  The claimant has  provided
    no independent evidence from which it can reasonably be  inferred  that
    he has a proficiency in speaking  at  this  level  now,  let  alone  in
    September 2013.

50. The certificates obtained in July 2014 have limited probative value for
    three reasons.  Firstly, on his own case, the claimant had  five  weeks
    of tuition before undertaking the test, whereas he  did  not  have  any
    tuition before sitting for his ETS test in September  2013.   Secondly,
    he had not put forward evidence to show  that  achieving  level  B1  in
    speaking and listening corresponds to achieving a score of  180  in  an
    ETS  test.   Thirdly,  although  I   attach   less   weight   to   this
    consideration, some ten  months  elapsed  between  the  taking  of  the
    separate tests, and thus it would be reasonable to expect the  claimant
    to have improved  his  speaking  ability  in  the  interim,  given  his
    continued exposure to life in the UK.

51. For the above reasons, I find that the claimant  has  not  provided  an
    innocent explanation for his speaking test being declared invalid and I
    find that the Secretary of State has discharged  the  legal  burden  of
    proof.  It is more likely than not that the reason why  the  claimant's
    speaking test has been invalidated is that he used a proxy test taker.

52. The claimant  relied  on  the  TOEIC  certificate  in  support  of  his
    application for leave to remain as a spouse, and so he falls foul of S-
    LTR2.2 which covers false  information,  representations  or  documents
    having been submitted in relation to the application  (including  false
    information specific to any person to obtain a document used in support
    of the application).

53. S-LTR.2.1 provides the applicant will normally be refused on grounds of
    suitability if any of  the  paragraphs  S-LTR.2.2  to  2.4  apply.   In
    assessing whether there is any basis for departing  from  the  norm  in
    this case, I bear in mind that the appellant is also facing  a  Section
    10 removal decision.

54. While I recognise that the  refusal  on  suitability  grounds  is  very
    distressing to Mrs Chen, at the same time there are not objectively any
    significant difficulties which would be faced by the claimant or her in
    continuing their family life together in China, still less difficulties
    which could not be overcome or would entail very serious  hardship  for
    either of them.  She has not lived in the UK all her life, and she  did
    not have a legitimate expectation of being able to carry on family life
    with the claimant in the UK on a permanent basis unless he met all  the
    relevant requirements of the Rules to be  granted  ILR.   One  specific
    difficulty mentioned in the grounds of  appeal  is  her  age,  and  the
    difficulty for both of them in finding employment on  return.   But  as
    stated in the IDIs, a material  change  in  quality  of  life  for  the
    applicant and their partner in the country of return, such as the  type
    of accommodation they would live in, or a reduction  in  their  income,
    would not usually amount to an insurmountable obstacle.  They have both
    managed to obtain  gainful  employment  here,  working  for  a  Chinese
    restaurant, and so there is no reason  why  they  could  not  undertake
    similar employment in China.

55. Turning to an  Article  8  claim  outside  the  Rules,  I  accept  that
    questions 1 and 2 of the Razgar test should be answered  in  favour  of
    the claimant with regard to the establishment  of  private  and  family
    life in the United Kingdom.  Questions 3 and 4 of the Razgar test  must
    be answered in favour of the respondent.  On the  crucial  question  of
    proportionality,  I  must  take  into  account  the   public   interest
    considerations arising under Section 117B of the 2002  Act.   The  ESOL
    test results were achieved over two years  ago,  and  they  are  not  a
    reliable guide to the claimant's linguistic proficiency in English now.
     I accept that the claimant  is  financially  independent,  but  little
    weight can be given to a  private  life  which  is  built  up  while  a
    person's status here in precarious.  The claimant does not qualify  for
    further leave to remain under the Rules, and the public interest in his
    removal is strongly reinforced by his use of deception.

56. The  predicament  in  which  the  claimant's  wife  is  placed  invites
    compassion, but ultimately I consider that she and her husband  face  a
    reasonable and not unduly  harsh  choice.   They  can  either  relocate
    together to China with a view to settling  there  permanently,  or  Mrs
    Chen can remain here to support an application for entry  clearance  by
    the claimant in due course.  As I explained to them both in the  course
    of the hearing, he is not facing a ten year ban from re-entry into  the
    United Kingdom.  Provided he leaves the  UK  voluntarily,  not  at  the
    expense directly or indirectly of the Secretary of State, he  would  be
    eligible to apply for entry clearance  to  return  as  a  spouse  after
    twelve months: see paragraph 320(7B) of the Rules.

57. For the above reasons, I find that the  decision  appealed  against  is
    proportionate to the legitimate  public  end  sought  to  be  achieved,
    namely the prevention of disorder  and  the  maintenance  of  firm  and
    effective immigration controls.  It strikes a fair balance between,  on
    the one hand the rights and interests of the claimant and  his  British
    national wife, and, on the other hand, the wider interests of society.
