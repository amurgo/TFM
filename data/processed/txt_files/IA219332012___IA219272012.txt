For the Appellants:    Mr Z Malik instructed by Malik Law Chambers,

For the Respondent:    Mr L Tarlow, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellants are citizens of India born  on  22  April  1976  and  17
    October 1976 respectively.  They have been granted permission to appeal
    against a decision of the First-tier Tribunal issued on 23 January 2013
    dismissing their appeals against the respondent's  decision  to  remove
    them as overstayers.

2.   The appellants arrived in the UK on 6 June 2004 with visit visas  valid
    until 20 November 2004  and  they  have  overstayed  since  that  date.
    Subsequently, they applied for further leave to remain on human  rights
    grounds but their applications were refused and the respondent  decided
    to remove the appellants.  Their appeal against that decision was heard
    by the First-tier Tribunal on 3 January 2013.  The judge was  satisfied
    that the respondent's decision was in accordance with the law and  that
    removal would not  be  disproportionate  to  a  legitimate  aim  within
    article 8.

3.   Permission to appeal was granted on the  basis  that  it  was  arguable
    that the judge had erred in law by failing to  consider  and  determine
    whether the discretion under para 353B of the HC 395 should  have  been
    exercised differently by the  respondent.   This  issue  has  now  been
    considered by the Upper  Tribunal  in  the  reported  determination  of
    Khanum and Others (Paragraph 353B) [2013] UKUT 00311 where it was  held
    that para 353B was not designed to replace para 395C and that in a case
    where there were  no  outstanding  further  considerations  and  appeal
    rights were exhausted, the decision whether  or  not  to  carry  out  a
    review within  the  scope  of  para  353B  was  entirely  a  matter  of
    discretion by the respondent and was not justifiable.

4.   Mr Malik conceded that if that case was correctly decided,  his  appeal
    could not succeed.  He did not seek to  make  any  further  submissions
    save to reserve his position on a challenge to that decision on appeal.
     I adopt and follow the reasoning  in  Khanum.  I  am  accordingly  not
    satisfied that the judge erred  in  law  by  failing  to  consider  the
    position under para 353B.  It has not been argued that the judge  erred
    in law in any other respect.

Decision

5.   The First-tier Tribunal did not err in law and the decision stands.
