Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Pratt (Solicitor)
For the Respondent:    Mr McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. I make an anonymity direction in this matter.

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Eritrea. He entered the United Kingdom on
    October 14,  2015  and  claimed  asylum.  The  respondent  refused  his
    application on September 26, 2016 under paragraph 336 and 339F HC 395.

 3. The appellant appealed that decision on October 10, 2016 and the appeal
    came before Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Robson (hereinafter called
    the Judge) on March 23, 2017. In a decision  promulgated  on  April  4,
    2017 the Judge dismissed the appeal on all grounds.

 4. The appellant appealed that decision on April 7, 2017 arguing the Judge
    had erred based on the acceptance the appellant was of draft age and an
    acceptance the appellant had  left  Eritrea  illegally.  Permission  to
    appeal was given by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Davies on July 31,
    2017. The respondent filed a Rule 24 response dated September 19,  2017
    albeit Mr McVeety did not rely on this at the hearing.

 5. The case came before me on the above date. Mr McVeety accepted that  as
    the Judge accepted the appellant had not left Eritrea  legally  and  he
    was of draft age then following the country guidance decision of MST  &
    Others (national service-risk categories) Eritrea CG [2016] UKUT  00443
    (IAC) the appellant was likely to be at risk of persecution. He saw  no
    reason to depart from the decision of MST and Mr Pratt agreed.

 6. Headnote 10 of MST states-

         "... a person whose asylum claim has not been found  credible,  but
         who is able to satisfy a decision-maker (i) that  he  or  she  left
         illegally, and (ii) that he or she is of or approaching draft  age,
         is likely to be perceived on return as a draft evader  or  deserter
         from national  service  and  as  a  result  face  a  real  risk  of
         persecution or serious harm."

 7.  Although  the  Judge  found  the  appellant's  core   account   lacked
    credibility, the fact he went onto find that the appellant's  departure
    was illegal and taking into account his age I am satisfied the  Judge's
    finding, that he was not at risk of persecution, did amount to an error
    in law. Mr McVeety accepted that returning  the  appellant  to  Eritrea
    would amount to persecution for the reasons contained in the grounds of
    appeal and did not oppose the remaking of the decision.




    NOTICE OF DECISION

 8. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.  I set aside Judge's decision and
    allow the appeal on both protection grounds and article 3 ECHR.
