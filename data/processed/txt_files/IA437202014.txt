Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant challenges the  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Clarke promulgated on 13 July 2015 ("the Decision").  By  the  Decision
    the Judge dismissed the Appellant's  appeal  against  the  Respondent's
    decision dated 27 October 2014 refusing him further leave to remain  in
    the UK outside the Immigration  Rules  and  directing  his  removal  to
    Cameroon.

 2. Permission to appeal was granted by Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge  Mailer
    on the basis that the Judge failed to make a finding or have regard  to
    the fact that the Appellant did not graduate until  November  2014  and
    that "it was crucial that he obtained his results prior to  making  his
    application". The Judge  considered  that  this  might  impact  on  the
    Judge's  finding  that  the  Appellant  was  responsible  for  his  own
    inability to meet the Rules at the time of his application.  The  Judge
    also granted permission on the basis that the First-tier Tribunal Judge
    failed to have regard to  Section  117B  Nationality,  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002 ("section 117B").

 3. I deal with the second of those points first.  Mr Turner did address me
    in relation to the proportionality assessment carried out by the  Judge
    to which I will  need  to  return.   He  did  not  however  pursue  the
    challenge based on Section 117B that the  Judge  failed  to  take  into
    account in the Appellant's favour that he  spoke  English  and  had  no
    recourse to public funds whilst in the UK.  In light of what is said in
    the case of AM (Section 117B) Malawi [2015] UKUT 260(IAC)  about  those
    factors, he was right to do so.  AM  makes  the  point  (with  which  I
    agree) that those are neutral factors. If they are  not  present,  they
    may count against an Appellant when weighing the  public  interest  but
    they are not positive factors against the public interest  if  they  do
    exist.

 4. Section 117B was  considered  at  [35]  of  the  Decision.   The  Judge
    properly took into account the fact that the Appellant's  situation  in
    the UK was precarious and the fact that the  maintenance  of  effective
    immigration control is in the public interest.   That  is  relevant  to
    this case not in the sense that the Appellant has  remained  unlawfully
    but because it is accepted by the Appellant that he was unable to  meet
    the Rules in the capacity for which he wished to apply at the  time  of
    his application.

 5. For the foregoing reasons, there is no error of law in relation to  the
    way in which the Judge dealt with Section 117B.

 6. Before turning to consider the Judge's assessment  of  proportionality,
    it is necessary to consider the Judge's factual findings.  That in turn
    requires a short summary of the facts.  The Appellant entered the UK on
    7 August 2011 as a Tier 4 Student with leave valid to  30  April  2013.
    He successfully applied for further leave valid until 30  August  2014.
    The application which led to the Decision was for ninety days leave  to
    remain outside the Rules to allow the Appellant time to apply for a PhD
    course. The Respondent refused the application on the  basis  that  she
    would only grant leave outside  the  Rules  if  there  were  compelling
    circumstances which did not exist in this  case.   She  also  made  the
    point that the Appellant  could  return  to  Cameroon  and  pursue  his
    studies or make applications for further study or employment from there
    and make a further application for entry clearance as a student or Tier
    2 migrant once he had secured a place on a course or employment.

 7. I deal first with the Judge's consideration of the Appellant's  reasons
    for not being able to apply in time for the PhD course.  Those  reasons
    and whether they amount to compelling circumstances is central  to  the
    Appellant's case that he should have been permitted to  remain  outside
    the Rules.

 8. The way in which the Appellant's case  was  put  before  the  Judge  is
    recited at [23] of the Decision as follows.

         "He experienced two bereavements which caused him  to  be  late  in
         completing the necessary documentation for  admission  to  his  PhD
         programme.  These  factors  are  compassionate  circumstances  that
         should have led to the grant  of  a  short  period  of  exceptional
         leave.

         Since his application the Appellant has been the victim of crime in
         relation to one of his Tier 2 applications resulting in the loss of
         ï¿½3000.00. It is submitted that this would be weighed in the balance
         when considering the proportionality [of] removing him to  Cameroon
         to make a new Tier 4 application as a PhD student from there."

 9. At [10] of  the  Decision  it  is  also  recorded  that,  although  the
    Appellant says that  it  was  due  to  grief  that  he  was  unable  to
    concentrate on his studies, when he applied to commence his PhD he  was
    told that it would take the  London  School  of  Commerce  to  whom  he
    applied four months to process his application. That being so, even  if
    he had made the application for the PhD course in  May  in  preparation
    for an in-time application for further  leave  at  a  student  (if  the
    bereavements had not occurred), it appears he would  not  have  secured
    sponsorship in time to apply for  further  leave  before  his  existing
    leave expired.

10. The Judge dealt with this aspect of the Appellant's case at [27] of the
    Decision.  That paragraph is the central focus of Mr Turner's complaint
    about the factual findings:

         "The difficulty for the Appellant is that he  failed  to  apply  in
         time to his Tier 4 sponsor to be enrolled on the PhD programme".

    (I pause to observe that Mr Turner accepted that this was in  fact  the
case).

         "The Appellant states that as his father died in May  2014  he  was
         unable to concentrate on the pursuit of his studies and prepare his
         application in time. However the Appellant knew that his MBA course
         was coming to a conclusion in the spring of 2014.  I find  that  Mr
         Awah must have given some consideration to his future  and  whether
         that  involved  further  academic  studies  or   employment   after
         completion of his MBA.   It is not likely that Mr Awah only thought
         about his future career after the death of his father in  May  2014
         or  that  he  suddenly  realised  that  he  needed  to  submit   an
         application  if he were to undertake further  academic studies.   I
         find therefore that Mr Awah simply failed to make  his  application
         for enrolment on  the  PhD  in  time.   This  failure  was  due  to
         tardiness and a lack of planning and organisation on Mr Awah's part
         in his final term of his MBA.  I  do  not  accept  that  Mr  Amah's
         failure to lodge an application form with his Tier 4 sponsor in the
         early part of 2014 can be explained  away  as  a  reaction  to  two
         deaths that took place after he had completed his MBA.  The  timing
         is critical. Mr Awah completed his MBA in March 2014 and,  applying
         the  balance  of  probabilities,  he  should  have  submitted   his
         application for his  doctorate  programme  in  his  final  term  or
         before, not after he had completed the course."

11. The way in which the Appellant's case was put in the grounds of  appeal
    is different. It is said that the Appellant was not in  a  position  to
    apply for his PhD earlier because in  fact  he  needed  to  obtain  the
    results from his current course.  It is the Judge's failure to  make  a
    finding on that which forms part of the grant of permission to  appeal.
    However Mr Turner very fairly accepted  that  he  could  not  point  to
    anything in the Appellant's evidence which suggests that this  was  the
    basis advanced before the First-tier Tribunal Judge. Certainly it  does
    not appear in [23] where Counsel's submissions are recorded.  I do  not
    therefore need to deal with that point.  The First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    could only deal with the case as put to him and that was not  the  case
    put to him either in evidence or  in  submissions.  I  should  probably
    record here that Mr Turner was not Counsel in the  First-tier  Tribunal
    and I do not therefore intend any criticism of him  for  not  advancing
    that case if in fact  those  were  Mr  Awah's  instructions.   However,
    neither can the Judge be criticised for not dealing with a  case  which
    was not advanced.

12. In spite of Mr Turner's submissions which at time came perilously close
    to a mere disagreement with the findings of facts, I am satisfied  that
    the finding at [27] did not amount to  an  error  of  law.   There  was
    evidence that it was as a direct consequence of the Appellant's failure
    to apply for the PhD course earlier that he did not obtain  sponsorship
    in time.  Had he made that application sooner, he may not  have  needed
    to seek leave to remain outside the Rules.

13. Mr Turner also focussed on the  Appellant's  unfortunate  situation  in
    relation to a Tier 2 application which he made in which he  became  the
    victim of fraudsters.  The Appellant reported this fraud to the  police
    and has complied with the police fraud investigation into  the  Tier  2
    "sponsors" at whose hands he suffered.  The Judge noted at [28] of  the
    Decision that the Appellant has indeed been the  victim  of  fraud  and
    that he has reported this to the  police and maintained  some  pressure
    on the police to do something about this. I have considerable  sympathy
    for the Appellant's plight and it is commendable that he has pursued  a
    complaint to the authorities about these persons.  However, that is not
    the basis on which the Appellant sought to remain in the UK. He did not
    say that he needed to be here in order to give evidence  for  a  police
    investigation or anything of that ilk. As such, the Judge was  entitled
    to find that this did not amount to a compelling reason to remain [29].

14. I turn then to consider the Judge's assessment of proportionality under
    Article 8 ECHR which is dealt with at [31] to  [38]  of  the  Decision.
    Having set out the case law, the Judge noted at [36] that the Appellant
    sought a period of ninety days to allow him to apply for his PhD.   The
    Judge was clearly aware therefore that the  period  sought  was  short.
    The Judge accepted that Mr Awah might be faced with higher  fees  as  a
    result of  having  to  return  to  Cameroon  to  make  an  application.
    However, the Appellant's evidence was that he could afford to pay those
    fees, albeit that this would stretch his finances.

15. The Judge went on to consider at [37] whether the  individual  interest
    of the Appellant was  such  as  to  outweigh  the  public  interest  in
    maintaining effective immigration control (which was as I  indicate  at
    [4] above relevant on the basis that the Appellant was unable  to  meet
    the Rules under which he wished to remain).  The Judge noted again  the
    additional cost which the Appellant might incur as a result  of  having
    to return to Cameroon.  However, having  incorporated  his  finding  at
    [27] that the Appellant was responsible for the predicament in which he
    found himself, he concluded that "the balance was tipped in  favour  of
    the public interest". Many of  the  points  which  Mr  Turner  made  in
    relation to the assessment of proportionality amount in  reality  to  a
    challenge to the finding at [27].   As I have already  found  at  [12],
    there is no error of law in the Judge's factual finding at [27] of  the
    Decision. There is similarly no error of law in the Judge's  conclusion
    in relation to proportionality for the same reasons.

Notice of Decision

I am satisfied that  the  Decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  does  not
contain any error of law and I uphold it.
