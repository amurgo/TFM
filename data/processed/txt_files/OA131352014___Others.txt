For the Appellants:    Mr A Swain, Counsel, instructed by Eagles Solicitors

For the Respondent:    Miss J Isherwood,  Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The first Appellant, a national of Afghanistan,  appealed  against  the
    Respondent's decision dated 2 September 2014. By that decision leave to
    enter was refused.  The second, third, fourth and fifth Appellants  are
    her children with the Sponsor who was granted refugee status and  after
    that date they had two further children [Z] and [I] born  in  2010  and
    2011 respectively.

2.   Their  appeal  against  the  ECO's  decisions  came  before  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Pedro who in a decision dated 3 December 2015  dismissed
    the appeals.  In particular, it had been  concluded  that  they  failed
    under the Rules in respect of the level of maintenance  and  the  judge
    for  his  part  also  had  doubts  about   the   sufficiency   of   the
    accommodation.  Nevertheless that matter having  been  considered,  the
    judge went on to hear submissions about Article 8. Mr Swain  has  fully
    set out the nature of the points being raised.

3.   In the decision at paragraph 6 the judge  noted  the  position  of  the
    Appellants under the Rules and indicated  that  they  had  gone  on  to
    appeal under Article 8 and the judge gave consideration to that matter.
     What is clear from the decision [D 10]  is  that  the  judge  was  not
    satisfied Article 8 was engaged and he confirmed that position  on  the
    basis that there were no compelling circumstances to warrant looking at
    the matter outside of the Immigration Rules (D 17].

4.   The judge nevertheless did look at and  consider  the  arguments  being
    run vis-ï¿½-vis the children and in particular took  those  into  account
    when assessing the sufficiency of the circumstances and whether or  not
    these were exceptional or, as he put it, compelling.  He did  not  find
    them so.  The position therefore was  that  notwithstanding  a  careful
    examination of the arguments being  put  albeit  he  could   have  done
    better in a discussion of Section 55 as a relevant consideration to the
    decision as to whether or not the Secretary of State's view was Article
    8 compliant was clear.  Mr Swain's grounds of appeal raise  essentially
    the Article 8 ECHR issues and argue that a  different  decision  should
    have been reached and in that it is fair to say he disagrees  with  the
    approach the judge took or the sufficiency of the point but I come back
    to the point that the  judge  was  actually  deciding  whether  or  not
    Article 8 was actually engaged albeit part of the exercise was to  look
    at Article 8 and the considerations being advanced.

5.   The grounds seeking permission to appeal do  not  address  that  issue,
    rather they address the Article 8 issue of itself and it  seems  to  me
    that when the ECO raised the issue and refused to  consider  Article  8
    outside of the Rules, the way was signposted.   I  find  therefore  the
    judge made no error of law in taking the view that he did that  Article
    8 ECHR was not engaged outside  of  the  Rules:  That  was  a  decision
    entirely for him. Of itself I do not find that it would be  appropriate
    for me to substitute a different view which I might well hold,  because
    I am in disagreement with the  judge;  who  after  all  had  heard  the
    evidence and considered all the submissions made.

6.   Ultimately it is not said that there are material omissions of fact  or
    matters which were  raised  which  could  only  lead  to  a  reasonable
    conclusion that Article 8 ECHR was engaged outside of the Rules.

7.   The ECO's position is  maintained  by  Miss  Isherwood.  It  is  simple
    point. However she also argued that the status of the two children Zain
    and Ithezaz was considered by the judge who [D12] concluded that he did
    not have the evidence of the risk of the forcible removal  of  the  two
    children out of Pakistan by the authorities or being forcibly  returned
    to Afghanistan.  In the circumstances I think  it  is  clear  that  the
    judge fairly examined the arguments of risk that were  associated  with
    it and would, had he found there was the real risk of British nationals
    being forcibly removed into Afghanistan, have taken a different view on
      any  compelling  or  exceptional  circumstances  to  justify  looking
    outside the rules.

8.   However, he did what he could on the evidence and in the  circumstances
    I find that there is no error of law.    I  note  that  permission  was
    given by First-tier Tribunal Judge Ford on 21 June 2016 but it seems to
    have escaped his attention the judge's findings that Article 8 ECHR was
    not engaged and that there were no compelling circumstances to  warrant
    its consideration outside the rules.  If the permission granted excited
    hope that there was substance in the appeal it is unfortunate and to be
    regretted.

9.   I think an anonymity order was appropriate  where  there  are  children
    involved and in the circumstances one is made.  The  Original  Tribunal
    made no error of law and the decisions stand
