                            DECISION AND REASONS

Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb

    1. We shall outline our decision in brief  terms,  having  come  to  the
       clear conclusion that the appeal should succeed.

    2. This is an appeal against refusal of entry  clearance  by  the  Entry
       Clearance Officer in Islamabad. The appellants are all  nationals  of
       Afghanistan and comprise eleven full siblings born between 25 January
       1995 and 21 June 2005.  Their older sister, [QK], born on 1  November
       1981 in Kandahar Afghanistan is the sponsor for  their  applications.
       She worked for aid agencies in Afghanistan between  August  2008  and
       November 2008. She won a scholarship to complete a Master's degree in
       public policy. She and her husband moved to Germany  to  pursue  this
       academic  course  however  in  her  absence  her   father   developed
       psychiatric problems which resulted in his being incapable of looking
       after her siblings. Subsequently her mother  abandoned  the  children
       and had to be looked after by others.

    3.  The  sponsor  returned  to  Afghanistan  and   took   formal   legal
       responsibility for all the appellants in November 2010. She completed
       her Master's degree through visits to Germany but also  continued  to
       work in Afghanistan for example as Gender Adviser to the  High  Peace
       Process. There is no dispute that she was forced to flee  Afghanistan
       because of threats issued against her in connection  with  her  work.
       She arrived in the UK  in  March  2012.  On  19  June  2012  she  was
       recognised as a refugee. In light of the work she had been  doing  in
       Afghanistan, the same work that had  exposed  her  to  risk  she  was
       nominated for the International Peace Prize  by  the  United  Nations
       Development Project.

    4. In mid 2012 her husband and 11 siblings applied for  Family  Reunion.
       The appellants had to prove on the balance of probabilities that they
       met the requirements of  the  UK  Immigration  Rules.  The  sponsor's
       husband was successful but the appellants were all refused  entry  to
       the UK on 7 November 2012. The primary reason given for  refusal  was
       that they are not her children for the purposes of the UK Immigration
       Rules because Afghan adoptions are not  recognised  under  the  Hague
       Convention and did not meet the requirements to be recognised  as  de
       facto adoptions.

    5. They appealed to the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  in  a  determination
       promulgated on 25 October 2013 FT Tribunal Judge  Seelhoff  dismissed
       the appeals. He did so having heard evidence  from  the  sponsor  and
       finding her to be "broadly credible having been internally consistent
       with the evidence given when the sponsor claimed asylum as summarised
       in her screening and  full  asylum  interviews.  There  has  been  no
       challenge to the evidence that the appellants' mother left the family
       home in 2010, and no challenge to the evidence that  the  appellants'
       father is mentally ill. Most importantly there is no challenge to the
       court documents that confirm  that  the  sponsor  was  appointed  the
       appellant's legal Guardian in Afghanistan." He also found that  there
       was family life between the appellants  and  the  sponsor  however  a
       relationship of in loco parentis such that the  relationship  between
       the sponsor and his siblings should be treated as akin to that  of  a
       parent  and  dependent  children  was   not   demonstrated   to   his
       satisfaction. Consideration of the FT Tribunal judge's  reasoning  is
       illuminating. He considered that he was unable to  allow  the  appeal
       under the Immigration Rules because the appellants were not  children
       of the sponsor as defined in cases of de facto adoptions in paragraph
       309A.

    6. Paragraph 309A read in material part,

       "For the purposes of adoption  ...  A  de  facto  adoption  shall  be
       regarded as having taken place if:

       a) At the time immediately preceding the making  of  the  application
          for entry clearance under  these  rules  the  adoptive  parent  or
          parents have been living abroad  (in  applications  involving  two
          parents both must have lived  abroad  together)  for  at  least  a
          period of time equal to the 1st period mentioned  in  subparagraph
          (b) (i) and must have cared for the child for at least a period of
          time equal to the 2nd period material in that subparagraph;

       b) and during the time abroad, the adoptive parent parents have:

          i. lived together for a minimum period of 18 months, of which the
             12 months immediately  preceding  the  application  for  entry
             clearance must have been spent living together with the child;
             and

         ii. have assumed the  role  of  the  child's  parents,  since  the
             beginning of the 18 month period, so that  there  has  been  a
             genuine transfer of parental responsibility"

    7. As the sponsor had been in the United Kingdom for the 5 month  period
       prior to the applications the  requirements  of  309A  could  not  be
       satisfied. Furthermore, the requirements under the Immigration  Rules
       were available as a  test  of  durability  of  the  relationship  and
       although the sponsor and her husband had demonstrated they  were  the
       sole legal guardians of her siblings with  a  relationship  that  was
       likely to go beyond what is normal for siblings, the relationship was
       not equivalent to them being parents. Although, because  the  sponsor
       was a refugee she could not be expected to return to Afghanistan  and
       in that way the refusal of visas for the appellants  interfered  with
       the sponsor's Article 8 family rights because her husband felt  bound
       to stay in Afghanistan to care for the appellants,

       ".... the sponsor's husband  has  a  visa  so  that  interference  is
       limited and it is a choice that he has stayed  and  not  visited  the
       [Sponsor.]"

    8. He also observed that the refusal of the entry clearance officer

       "... serves the UK public interest for considerable economic reasons.
       Although the sponsor is work earning �32,000 a year a family with  11
       children could expect to be housed in a 6 bedroom property at  public
       expense ... Rent on a 6 bedroom property could easily run to  �500  a
       week  albeit  benefit  caps  would  kick  in  for  the  family.  Even
       accounting for the sponsor's income the family is likely  to  need  a
       considerable top up from public funds to make ends meet in the  short
       term. The refusal is also in keeping with  the  wider  needs  of  the
       refugee convention and the system of refugee protection as the burden
       on receiving states  would  be  far  higher  than  expected  to  take
       responsibility for large extended families on a regular basis.

       ... In respect of the children's best interests I do acknowledge that
       in many ways they would be better off in the UK and living  with  the
       sponsor but this finding is not determinative of the Article 8 appeal

       On the evidence before me I found that the decision to  refuse  leave
       is proportionate and does not represent a breach of  the  appellant's
       Article 8 rights or those of their sponsor. I will note for the  sake
       of future applications that had  I  been  presented  with  sufficient
       evidence to corroborate the assertions made about the nature  of  the
       relationship between the  sponsor  and  her  siblings  I  might  have
       reached different conclusion."

    9. The applicant appealed. Permission was  refused  initially  and  upon
       renewal. However Mr Justice Holman granted the appellants  permission
       to apply for judicial review on 22 May 2014 on the basis,  inter-alia
       that it was highly arguable that having found Article 8 to be engaged
       the FT  Tribunal  judge  did  not  perform  the  obligatory  balanced
       analysis of the competing Article 8  factors.  Rather,  he  leapt  to
       consideration of the economic interests of the state.  Permission  to
       appeal to the Upper Tribunal was granted on 10 December 2014 by  Vice
       President Ockelton.

   10. In a decision and reasons promulgated on 16 April 2015  Deputy  Upper
       Tribunal Judge Monson noted that the Secretary of State had  conceded
       the error of FT Tribunal Judge Seelhoff at the outset of the hearing.
        The proceeded thereafter by way of a hearing for a fresh decision to
       be made considering the circumstances at the  date  of  the  original
       refusal decision. After reviewing the findings of fact  judge  Monson
       was satisfied that no additional findings of fact were  required.  At
       the heart of the appellants' submissions was the fact that there  was
       no one else to look after the children apart from the sponsor and  in
       the fact specific circumstances  it  could  not  be  right  that  the
       proportionality question was resolved against the appellants  because
       there were 11 of them rather than one or two. Judge Monson  concluded
       (not controversially) that questions 1  and  2  of  the  Razgar  test
       should be answered in the appellants favour because the effect of the
       refusal decision was to prevent family reunion with their sister  who
       had assumed parental responsibility for them. Questions 3  and  4  of
       the Razgar test however should be answered in favour of the SSHD  and
       so the critical question was whether the decision was proportionate.

   11. Unfortunately, Deputy Upper Tribunal  Judge  Monson  also  fell  into
       error. He declared,

       "44. The effect of the refusal decision is that  the  status  quo  is
       maintained, with the appellants being looked after by  the  sponsor's
       husband. The status quo was not disturbed by  the  sponsor's  husband
       being granted entry clearance under the rules, as it was a matter  of
       choice whether the sponsor's husband took advantage of the  grant  of
       entry clearance. At the date of decision  he  was  not  compelled  to
       abandon the appellants, leaving them without the day-to-day care of a
       responsible adult relative.

       45. Clearly the sponsor and her  husband  would  much  prefer  to  be
       together, rather than to be kept apart by force of circumstances. But
       from the perspective of the appellants the  impact  on  them  of  the
       refusal decision was not  as  stark  as  has  been  suggested.  Their
       emotional dependency on the sponsor's husband is likely to be greater
       than their emotional depend dependency on the sponsor, as he  is  the
       responsible adult  who  has  had  continuous  and  direct  day-to-day
       contact with them, whereas family life  with  the  sponsor  has  been
       punctuated by long periods of absence,  and  she  only  assumed  sole
       responsibility of them in substitution  for  the  appellants'  actual
       parents a relatively short time before she fled the country.

       46. On the Article 8(2) side of the equation, there are 2 strands  of
       the public interest which  are  strongly  engaged.  The  1st  is  the
       protection of the country's economic well-being, and the 2nd  is  the
       intrinsic public interest recognised in  subsection  (1)  of  section
       117B of the 2002 Act, which  is  the  public  interest  in  effective
       immigration control. The greater  the  financial  burden  on  the  UK
       taxpayer consequential upon the  admission  of  the  appellants,  the
       stronger  is  the  justification  in  refusing  entry  clearance   on
       financial grounds. Just as it is recognised in the jurisprudence that
       the United Kingdom cannot be National Health Service  for  the  whole
       world, by parity of reasoning the United Kingdom cannot be a guardian
       of the interests of minor children throughout the whole world.  There
       are sound policy reasons for  not  admitting  relatives  of  refugees
       unless such relatives can bring themselves within the  scope  of  the
       applicable rules or policies relating to the admission  of  relatives
       of refugees."

   12.  The  appellants  sought  to  appeal  but  were  refused  permission.
       Thereafter they pursued an appeal to the Court of Appeal  and  on  21
       February 2017, the respondent having conceded that the Upper Tribunal
       had erred, the appeal was allowed and remitted to the Upper Tribunal.
       The matter proceeded before us as a re-determination  on  submissions
       only. Both sides were content that we should consider the  evidential
       findings made by FT Tribunal Judge Seelhoff.

   13. It is also agreed that the circumstances to be considered were  those
       present in 2012. Events thereafter are of  interest  but  not  direct
       relevance. Further consensus is  found  in  the  application  of  the
       Immigration Rules, the  fact  that  as  Afghanistan  is  a  non-Hague
       Convention country the only route to entry for these appellants is by
       virtue of rights under Article 8 ECHR.  The  essence  of  these  were
       described with lucidity by counsel for the respondent as the  sponsor
       having taken responsibility for the children, being stranded  in  the
       UK and her husband in Afghanistan being left "holding the babies". As
       a consequence the husband is unable to enjoy  family  life  with  his
       wife the sponsor: she likewise. As  the  First  Tier  Tribunal  found
       there can be no doubt that the children's best interests lie with the
       grant of entry. It is urged on their behalf that the reason that  the
       sponsor cannot rely on de facto adoption, namely that being a refugee
       who axiomatically has had to flee her country of origin, she has  not
       satisfied the periods of residence with the  children,  should  be  a
       factor in the proportionality assessment. Finally, it is argued  that
       the children themselves are being  treated  less  favourably  because
       they are the adopted children of a refugee.

   14. Mr Deller, has accepted  that  the  Court  of  Appeal  remitted  this
       decision to the Upper Tribunal because this  specialist  tribunal  is
       better placed to apply the section 117(2)(b) Nationality, Immigration
       and Asylum Act 2002 considerations.

       "PART 5AArticle 8 of the ECHR: public interest considerations

       117AApplication of this Part

       (1)    This Part applies where a court or  tribunal  is  required  to
       determine whether a    decision made under the Immigration Acts-

          a) breaches a person's right to respect for  private  and  family
             life under Article 8, and

          b) as a result would be unlawful under section  6  of  the  Human
             Rights Act 1998.

       (2)    In considering the public  interest  question,  the  court  or
       tribunal must (in particular) have regard-

          a) in all cases, to the considerations listed  in  section  117B,
             and

          b) in cases concerning the deportation of foreign  criminals,  to
             the considerations listed in section 117C.

       (3) In subsection (2),  "the  public  interest  question"  means  the
       question of whether an interference with a person's right to  respect
       for private and family life is justified under Article 8(2).

       117BArticle 8: public interest considerations applicable in all cases

    1) The maintenance of effective immigration controls is  in  the  public
       interest.

    2) It is in the public interest, and in particular in the  interests  of
       the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that persons who  seek
       to enter or remain in the United Kingdom are able to  speak  English,
       because persons who can speak English-

          (a) are less of a burden on taxpayers, and

          (b) are better able to integrate into society.

    3) It is in the public interest, and in particular in the  interests  of
       the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that persons who  seek
       to enter or remain in the United Kingdom are financially independent,
       because such persons-

          (a) are not a burden on taxpayers, and

          (b) are better able to integrate into society."

   15. We agree with Mr Deller's careful and rational submissions that while
       the  sponsor's  husband's  situation  has  been  mischaracterised  by
       previous Tribunal judges as a voluntary choice between  remaining  in
       Afghanistan to look after dependent children and enjoying his and the
       sponsor's right to family  life  as  a  couple,  the  fact  that  the
       appellants find themselves in this situation is not determinative. We
       are quite satisfied that if the acute dilemma they face  amounted  to
       an unanswerable factor requiring visas for the  appellants  then  the
       Court of Appeal would have said so. In carrying out the exercise that
       we are required to do we conclude that no single feature of this case
       compels success for the appellants. However, we are persuaded, in the
       end firmly persuaded, that the Entry Clearance officer's decisions in
       the case of each  of  the  eleven  appellants  in  2012  amounted  to
       disproportionate interference with Article 8 rights.

   16. The public law duty to engage with all material evidence required the
       decision maker to have proper  regard  to  the  particular,  distinct
       position of this sponsor vis a vis her particular siblings.  She  had
       done all she could to gain legal custody and responsibility for them.
       They had no one else, as the First Tier Tribunal Judge found,  except
       her husband. There can be no real suggestion that  the  situation  of
       the sponsor and her husband was designed or devised in order to force
       the decision-maker to grant the visas. They had no humane option: the
       sponsor had fled Afghanistan  and  her  husband  could  readily  have
       joined her but for his compassionate and  commendable  commitment  to
       the appellants. The vulnerability of a large family of children, some
       of them as young as 7-9, in a setting such as they were in, is  self-
       evident. To observe that their best interests, a primary concern, lay
       in not being abandoned is to do no more than recognise  the  obvious.
       S.55 Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 provides that  the
       SSHD has a duty to have regard to the welfare of children within  the
       UK and  (as  for  entry  clearance  and  other  such  decisions)  the
       application of Article 8 must be consistent with the UK's obligations
       under international law: ZH (Tanzania) v SSHD [2011] UKSC 4.

   17. The difficulty of a refugee ever being able to act as a sponsor under
       the de facto adoption rules has been  recognised  in  previous  cases
       such as MK (Somalia) & Ors v ECO [2008] EWCA Civ 1453  but  the  dual
       factor of the sponsor's inability to meet the requirements of 309A in
       this case together with the very same circumstances depriving her  of
       her right to family life with her husband  is  a  deprivation  beyond
       such examples.

   18. These powerful circumstances then met the substantial counter-vailing
       considerations of overall immigration  control  and  specific  public
       interest matters such that the likely  if  not  inevitable  financial
       consequences of an extended family joining the population of the  UK.
       These features  are  striking  in  this  case  because  the  UK  will
       potentially take on a significant social care burden arising  from  a
       decision of  the  sponsor  to  seek  refugee  status  which  was  not
       compelled by any action of this country.

   19. However, as already noted. We are  quite  certain  that,  taking  the
       facts as found by the FF Tribunal Judge the consequence is  that  the
       Entry Clearance  Officer's  decisions  engaged  Article  8  ECHR  and
       amounted to a disproportionate interference.

   20. The appeals of the appellants  are  allowed.  We  are  not  making  a
       recommendation that entry clearance is granted but we expect the  ECO
       to deal with this matter expeditiously.

       Conclusion

   21. The appeals of the appellants are allowed.




        Signed:


                  Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb DBE

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As we have allowed the appeal  and  because  a  fee  has  been  paid  or  is
payable, we have considered making a fee award and have decided  to  make  a
fee award of any fee which has been paid or may be payable  (adjusted  where
full award not justified) for the following reason.


Signed   Date 29th June 2017
