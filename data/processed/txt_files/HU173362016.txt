For the Respondent:    Mr I Richards, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background

 1. The appellant is a citizen of the Philippines who was born on  21  June
    1971.  She entered the United Kingdom as a visitor on  7  October  2007
    with leave valid  until  29  March  2008.   On  12  December  2007,  by
    amendment, the period of leave granted as a  result  of  the  visa  was
    extended to 29 September 2008.

 2. On 8 September 2008, the appellant applied for leave  to  remain  as  a
    carer.  That application was refused on 7 November 2008.  A  subsequent
    appeal was allowed and she was granted Discretionary Leave ("DL")  from
    16 February 2009 until 16 February 2012.

 3. On 15 May 2009, the appellant applied for a Certificate of Approval  to
    marry a British Citizen, John Richards.  That was issued  on  6  August
    2009 and she subsequently married John Richards on a date which is  not
    disclosed in the papers.

 4. On 8 February 2012, the  appellant  applied  for  indefinite  leave  to
    remain ("ILR") as the spouse of a British  Citizen.   That  application
    was refused on the same day.

 5. On 14 February 2012, the appellant applied for leave to remain  outside
    the Immigration Rules.  On 21 February 2003, the appellant was  granted
    three years' DL "based on [her] family  and  private  life  with  [her]
    partner, now spouse John Richards".

 6. The appellant's spouse subsequently passed away.  On 28  January  2016,
    the appellant applied for ILR as a bereaved partner under Section BPILR
    of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules (HC 395 as amended).

 7. On 14 June  2016,  the  Secretary  of  State  refused  the  appellant's
    application for ILR under Appendix FM as  a  bereaved  partner  on  the
    basis that she did not fulfil a necessary requirement under Section  E-
    BPILR.1.2., namely that the "last grant of limited leave"  to  her  had
    not been as a "partner ... of  a British Citizen".  Her last  grant  of
    leave had been outside the Rules and not as a "partner" under  Appendix
    FM.

The Judge's Decision

 8. The appellant appealed to the  First-tier  Tribunal.   The  appeal  was
    heard by Judge Powell who  dismissed  the  appeal.   It  was  initially
    argued by the respondent's representative before Judge Powell that  the
    appellant did  not  have  a  right  of  appeal  under  the  new  appeal
    provisions introduced by the Immigration Act 2014 on the basis that the
    appellant had not made a human rights' claim  and  there  had  been  no
    refusal of such a claim so as to give rise to a right of  appeal  under
    s.82(1) of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002  (as
    amended).  Judge Powell rejected that argument and concluded that there
    was a valid  appeal  before  him.   The  Secretary  of  State  had  not
    subsequently sought to challenge that conclusion either in the rule  24
    notice or in submissions before me.  It is accepted that the judge  had
    jurisdiction to hear an appeal based, in effect,  upon  Art  8  of  the
    ECHR.

 9. In dismissing the appeal under Art 8, Judge Powell made essentially two
    findings.

10. First, he rejected the appellant's  argument  that  she  could  succeed
    under Section BPILR of  Appendix  FM  because  he  concluded  that  the
    appellant's "last grant of  limited  leave"  was  not  as  a  "partner"
    granted under Appendix FM but rather was a  grant  of  DL  outside  the
    Rules.  The eligibility requirement for ILR as a bereaved  partner  set
    out in E-BPILR.1.2. required that the "last grant of limited leave"  as
    a "partner" was under the Rules.  In other words, he  agreed  with  the
    interpretation adopted by  the  Secretary  of  State  in  refusing  the
    appellant's application.

11. Secondly, in approaching the appellant's claim outside the Rules  under
    Art 8, having noted that she could not succeed  under  the  Rules,  the
    judge looked to  whether  there  were  "compelling  circumstances  that
    outweigh the public interest".  He noted  that  no  evidence  had  been
    called as to the appellant's circumstances  and  that  the  appellant's
    claim had turned upon the submission that her failure to succeed  under
    the Rules was a "near miss" which was by itself sufficient to  outweigh
    the public interest.  The judge rejected that submission  and,  in  the
    absence of any evidence, concluded that the  appellant  had  failed  to
    establish compelling circumstances sufficient to  outweigh  the  public
    interest.

The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

12. The appellant sought permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal on  two
    grounds.  First, the judge had been wrong to find  that  the  appellant
    could not succeed under Appendix FM  as  her  "last  grant  of  limited
    leave" was as a "partner" despite  being  granted  outside  the  Rules.
    Section E-BPILR.1.2. should, it was contended,  not  be  restricted  to
    grants of leave under the Rules to a person as a "partner".   Secondly,
    it was contended that the judge had  erred  in  law  in,  nevertheless,
    dismissing the appeal under Art 8 as the decision to refuse her ILR was
    disproportionate.

13. Initially, the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Hodgkinson)  refused  the
    appellant permission to appeal.  However, on 3 August  2017  the  Upper
    Tribunal (UTJ Keki?) granted the appellant permission to appeal on  all
    grounds.

The Submissions

14. Before me, Mr Webb maintained  the  argument,  unsuccessfully  advanced
    before Judge Powell, that Section E-BPILR.1.2. should not be restricted
    to situations where the applicant's "last grant of limited leave" as  a
    "partner" was under Appendix  FM.   He  relied  upon  the  respondent's
    decision of 21 February 2013 which stated that the appellant was  being
    granted 3 years "Discretionary Leave based on your family  and  private
    life with your partner, now spouse John Richards".

15. Mr Webb submitted that if the Secretary of State in Section E-BPILR.1.2
    had meant to restrict the "last grant of limited leave" as a  "partner"
    to someone granted such leave under  the  Rules,  it  would  have  been
    explicitly included in the wording by the simple addition of "under the
    Rules".  Mr Webb submitted that to allow the appellant to  switch  from
    leave as a "partner", albeit granted outside the Rules,  to  ILR  as  a
    bereaved partner, was consistent with the purpose of  the  Rules  which
    was to allow a surviving partner to remain in the UK after the death of
    the other partner.  The whole basis of  leave  under  the  Rules  as  a
    "partner" was, Mr Webb submitted, to comply with Art 8 of the ECHR  and
    the respect for the private and family life of the  partners  and  that
    was precisely the basis upon which the appellant had been granted DL on
    21 February 2013.  Mr Webb submitted that an interpretation of  Section
    E-BPILR.1.2. that included leave granted outside the Rules would be  to
    interpret the provision consistently with the obligation  to  recognise
    the appellant's Art 8 rights under the Human Rights Act 1998.

16. Mr Richards, on behalf of the Secretary of State, contended that  Judge
    Powell had correctly interpreted the Rules.  He submitted that  it  was
    clear from the grant of leave to the appellant that she  had  not  been
    granted leave to remain as a partner under the  Rules  and,  therefore,
    her claim under Art 8 should be approached on the basis that she  could
    not meet the requirements of the Rules.  The judge was  right  and  the
    appeal should be dismissed.

Discussion

    1. Error of Law: The Rules

17. The provisions dealing  with  ILR  (and  indeed  limited  leave)  as  a
    'bereaved partner' are set out in Section BPILR of Appendix FM  of  the
    Rules.  By virtue of Section  BPILR.1.1.(d),  the  appellant  must,  in
    order to meet the requirements of the Rules, meet all the  requirements
    of "Section E-BPILR: Eligibility for indefinite leave to  remain  as  a
    bereaved partner".

18. The only relevant requirement in Section  E-BPILR  in  this  appeal  is
    found in E-BPILR.1.2. which provides as follows:

         "The applicant's last grant of limited leave must have been as -

         (a)  a partner (other than a fianc�(e) or proposed  civil  partner)
             of a British Citizen or a person settled in the UK; or

         (b)  a bereaved partner".

19. The appellant relies upon E-BPILR.1.2.(a).

20. Appendix FM defines, for the purposes of Appendix FM,  a  "partner"  in
    GEN.1.2. as follows:

         "For the purposes of this Appendix 'partner' means -

         (i)  the applicant's spouse;

         (ii)     the applicant's civil partner;

         (iii)    the applicant's fianc�(e) or proposed civil partner; or

         (iv)     a person who has been living together with  the  applicant
             in a relationship akin to a marriage or civil partnership  for
             at least two years prior to the date of application,

         unless a different meaning of partner  applies  elsewhere  in  this
             Appendix".

21. It was common ground between the parties that the appellant could  not,
    at the time she applied for leave as a "partner", meet the requirements
    of Appendix FM as a partner or, to the  extent  that  the  transitional
    provisions required her application to be considered under  Part  8  of
    the Rules in force before 9 July 2012, because she lacked the necessary
    or required leave as a condition to the grant of ILR as a spouse.

22. The proper approach when interpreting the Immigration Rules was set out
    by the Supreme Court in the case of Mahad and Others v Entry  Clearance
    Officer [2009] UKSC 16.  Lord Brown, delivering the  leading  judgment,
    stated at [10]:

         "The Rules  are  not  to  be  construed  with  all  the  strictness
         applicable  to  the  construction  of  a  statue  or  a   statutory
         instrument but, instead, sensibly  according  to  the  natural  and
         ordinary meaning of the  words  used,  recognising  that  they  are
         statements of the Secretary of State's administrative policy".

23. Lord Brown cited his earlier view expressed  in  MO  (Nigeria)  v  SSHD
    [2009] 1 WLR 230 at [33] that:

         "the question is what the Secretary of State intended.   The  rules
         are her rules".  (Emphasis in original).

24. Having stated that, Lord Brown continued in Mahad (at [10]):

         "That intention is to be discerned objectively  from  the  language
         used, not divined by reference to supposed  policy  considerations.
         Still less is the Secretary of State's intention to  be  discovered
         from  the  Immigration  Directorates  Instructions  (IDIs)   issued
         intermittently to guide Immigration Officers in  their  application
         of the Rules".

25. Subsequently, the Court of Appeal recognised in Adedoyin v SSHD  [2010]
    EWCA Civ 773 that, exceptionally, an IDI might  provide  some  guidance
    where the wording of the Rule was genuinely ambiguous.

26. In this case, neither Mr Webb nor Mr Richards drew my attention to  any
    IDI or other policy document dealing with  the  interpretation  of  the
    provision in Appendix FM in issue in this appeal.

27. During the course of  argument,  I  raised  with  both  representatives
    whether Appendix FM contained any provision which  explicitly  required
    an individual to establish leave granted under  Appendix  FM.   Neither
    representative drew my attention to any such  provision.   I,  however,
    raised with the representatives the provisions in Appendix  FM  dealing
    with the grant of ILR  to  a  partner  in  E-ILRP.1.3.  where  specific
    reference is made to limited leave under the Rules as follows:

         "The applicant must have completed a continuous period of at  least
         60 months with limited  leave  as  a  partner  under  paragraph  R-
         LTRP.1.1.(a) to (c) or in the UK with entry clearance as a  partner
         under paragraph D-ECP.1.1.; or a continuous period of at least  120
         months  with  limited  leave  as  a  partner  under  paragraph   R-
         LTRP.1.1.(a), (b) and (d) or in the UK with entry  clearance  as  a
         partner under paragraph D-ECP.1.1.; or a continuous  period  of  at
         least  120  months  with  limited  leave  as  a  partner  under   a
         combination of these paragraphs, excluding in all cases any  period
         of entry clearance or limited leave  as  a  fianc�(e)  or  proposed
         civil partner". (my emphasis)

28. Here, as the emphasised words highlight, the relevant leave must be "as
    a partner" under particular provisions in Appendix FM.   On the face of
    it, this provides  some  support  Mr  Webb's  submission  that  if  the
    Secretary of State had wished to limit the grant of limited leave as  a
    partner to a  grant  under  the  Rules  in  E-BPILR.1.2.(a)  she  could
    explicitly have done so.

29. Without setting out in full the two sets of provisions in  Appendix  FM
    referred to in E-ILRP.1.3., it is clear that the wording in E-ILRP.1.3.
    is concerned with the need to establish a period of limited leave under
    the Rules under one of the two routes  which  potential  leads  to  ILR
    under the Rules having been granted limited leave as  a  partner  under
    the Rules.  The first route where the more  onerous  conditions  in  R-
    LTRP.1.1.(a) to (c) are met is 60 months whilst when the  less  onerous
    requirements for leave as a partner in R-LTRP.1.1.(a), (b) and (d)  are
    met is 120 months.  These are  often  referred  to  as  the  'five-year
    route' and the 'ten-year route'.  I accept that these provisions  offer
    some support to Mr Webb's submission.  However, the route to ILR  as  a
    partner is part of a settlement route built into  Appendix  FM  of  the
    Rules and, therefore, it is hardly surprising that E--ILRP.1.3.  refers
    to the two limited leave routes as a  partner  under  the  Rules.   The
    reference to the Rules is a necessary concomitant of that.

30. What is, it seems to me, more significant and more strongly supports Mr
    Webb's submissions, are the provisions in Appendix FM dealing with  the
    grant of ILR based upon domestic violence set out in Section DVILR.  In
    Section E-DVILR.1.2., one of the eligibility requirements for ILR as  a
    victim of domestic violence is that:

         "The applicant's first grant of limited leave under  this  Appendix
         must have been as a partner (other than  a  fianc�(e)  or  proposed
         civil partner) of a British Citizen or a person settled in  the  UK
         under paragraph D-ECP.1.1.,  D-LTRP.1.1.  or  D-LTRP.1.2.  of  this
         Appendix and any subsequent grant of leave must have been:

         (a)  granted as a partner (other than a fianc�(e) or proposed civil
             partner) of a British Citizen or a settled person  in  the  UK
             under paragraphs D-ECP.1.1.,  D-LTRP.1.1.  or  D-LTRP.1.2.  of
             this Appendix; ...".

31. There, the reference to "limited leave" is specifically by reference to
    Appendix FM both in terms of the "first grant" of such  leave  and  any
    subsequent grant of leave as a  "partner".   Those  provisions  clearly
    distinguish between the grant of "limited leave"  to  a  partner  under
    Appendix FM and the grant of  limited  leave  to  an  individual  as  a
    partner, albeit outside the Rules.

32. Here, the ILR provisions dealing with a  victim  of  domestic  violence
    cannot, in my judgment, so easily be seen to  represent  a  progression
    from a grant of limited leave leading to settlement.   That  said  they
    provide, of course, a substitute route to ILR when the  ILR  route  for
    settlement as a partner under the Rules is taken away  because  of  the
    incidence of domestic violence.  In that regard, they have  a  striking
    similarity with the bereaved partner provisions  except  that,  in  the
    latter instance, there is no requirement that the  limited  leave  must
    have been granted under  the  Rules.   The  contrast  between  the  ILR
    provisions for a "bereaved partner" in Section BPILR and for the  grant
    of ILR to a victim of domestic violence in Section  DVILR  is  all  the
    more apparent given that the two Sections follow each other in Appendix
    FM.  In my judgment, the wording of  E-DVILR.1.2.  supports  Mr  Webb's
    submission that had the Secretary of State  intended  to  restrict  the
    requirement that the applicant's last grant of  "limited  leave"  as  a
    "partner" to leave granted under Appendix FM, the  Secretary  of  State
    could have explicitly stated that in the Rules.  She did precisely that
    in E-DVILR.1.2. when dealing with eligibility for the grant of ILR as a
    victim of domestic violence.

33. Whilst, of course, the vast majority of cases in  which  an  individual
    seeks ILR as a bereaved partner is likely to  arise  in  the  situation
    where the last grant of leave as a "partner" was under Appendix FM,  in
    my judgment, that is not a necessary requirement  because  E-BPILR.1.2.
    is not so restricted.

34. In addition to the juxtaposition of the provisions dealing with ILR for
    a bereaved partner and the victim of domestic violence, I  also  accept
    Mr Webb's submission that the plain intention of the Secretary of State
    arising from the wording of the relevant provisions was  to  permit  an
    individual who had leave as a partner to, in appropriate circumstances,
    seek ILR as a bereaved partner when they could no  longer  satisfy  the
    requirements of  leave  as  a  partner  and  were,  as  a  consequence,
    necessarily removed from the ILR route which would otherwise be open to
    them.  The 'bereaved partner'  provisions  seek,  in  my  judgment,  to
    overcome the perceived unfair disruption to the individual's  route  to
    settled status as a partner through no fault of their own as  a  result
    of the death of their British Citizen or settled  partner  in  the  UK.
    That underlying purpose is no less reflected in  a  case  such  as  the
    present where the appellant was explicitly granted leave, albeit DL and
    in other cases it may be explicitly leave  outside  the  Rules  on  the
    basis of Art 8, as a "partner".  In such a case,  the  grant  of  leave
    will reflect the Secretary  of  State's  acceptance  that  there  is  a
    genuine and subsisting relationship which justifies the grant of leave,
    albeit outside the Rules.  Whilst there may be no formal route to  ILR,
    and I was not shown any material in relation  to  this,  the  partner's
    death during the course of that grant of leave outside the Rules  will,
    in a closely analogous way, unfairly affect the surviving  partner  and
    his or her immigration status in the UK at a time when through no fault
    of their own they had an expectation of extant leave continuing.  It is
    worth nothing that  the  letter  of  21  February  2013  detailing  the
    appellant's grant of three  years'  DL  specifically  referred  to  the
    appellant seeking an extension of leave in  the  future  and  that  she
    would  be  eligible  for  settlement  having  "completed  6  years   of
    Discretionary Leave".  In other words, the appellant,  like  a  partner
    under Appendix FM, was granted leave on a route  which  could  lead  to
    settlement.

35. Mr Richards did not submit that there was any underlying policy  reason
    why an individual such as the appellant  should  not  fall  within  the
    bereaved  partner  provisions  and,  in  particular,  the   eligibility
    requirement for ILR in E-BPILR.1.2.  His submission was,  put  shortly,
    that the word "partner" had to  be  understood  as  a  partner  granted
    limited leave under the  Rules.   I  reject  that  submission  for  the
    reasons I have given.

36. Of course, this 'broader'  interpretation  of  the  requirement  in  E-
    BPILR.1.2., requires a grant of leave outside the Rules explicitly as a
    partner and not on any other  basis.   So,  for  example,  as  occurred
    earlier  in  this  appellant's  immigration   history,   a   grant   of
    discretionary leave or leave outside the Rules as a carer - even  as  a
    carer of a partner - would not suffice.  A grant of leave  outside  the
    Rules as a parent would not suffice; just as a  grant  of  leave  as  a
    parent under the Rules would not suffice to meet the requirement in  E-
    BPILR.1.2.

37. However, here the grant of leave on 21 February 2013 - which I set  out
    verbatim above - was explicitly on the basis of her  relationship  with
    her "partner".  It was not on the basis that  she  was  his  carer  or,
    indeed, on any other basis.  It was, in my  judgment,  "limited  leave"
    granted to her as a "partner  ...  of  a  British  Citizen"  within  E-
    BPILR.1.2.  The judge erred in law in concluding otherwise.

    2. Error of Law: Art 8

38. Having erroneously concluded that the  appellant  could  not  meet  the
    requirements of Appendix FM, the judge went on to  consider  Art  8  on
    that basis.  This was, of  course,  an  appeal  only  on  human  rights
    grounds, namely Art 8.  It was in that context that he identified  that
    the appellant must establish "compelling circumstances" to outweigh the
    public interest (see para 39) and went on to conclude that  there  were
    none, rejecting in the process Mr Webb's submission  that  this  was  a
    "near miss" case such that the  public  interest  was  outweighed  (see
    paras 40-43).

39. Because the judge approached Art 8 on  the  basis  that  the  appellant
    could not meet the requirements of the Rules, he necessarily  erred  in
    law in his approach to Art 8.  He should, instead, have approached  the
    appellant's  claim  under  Art  8  on  the  basis  that  she  met   the
    requirements of the Rules in respect of 'bereaved partner'.

40. Consequently, his decision in respect of Art 8  is  flawed  and  cannot
    stand.  That decision must now be re-made.

    3. Re-making the Art 8 Decision

41. The judge made a  number  of  findings  favourable  to  the  appellant.
    First, he accepted that she had established private life in the UK (see
    para 33) and that the refusal of leave engaged Art 8 because:

         "after living here for 9 years, the majority of it as a wife, I  am
         satisfied that  the  interference  with  her  private  life  is  of
         sufficient gravity".

42. Having concluded that Art 8.1 was engaged, the judge went  on  to  find
    that the decision was in accordance with the law and for  a  legitimate
    aim.  Nevertheless, he went on to find,  given  the  limited  evidence,
    that there were no "compelling circumstances"  sufficient  to  outweigh
    the public interest  so  that  the  decision  was  not,  in  his  view,
    disproportionate.

43. Given that the appellant meets the requirements of  the  Rules,  it  is
    difficult to see  how  the  public  interest  in  the  "maintenance  of
    effective immigration controls" set out in s.117B of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 is engaged.  Judge Powell  pointed  out
    at para 27 of his determination that there was no evidence led  on  the
    appellant's  behalf  as  to  whether  or  not  she   was   "financially
    independent" for the purposes of s.117B(3).  By contrast, it  does  not
    appear to have been suggested before the judge that the  appellant  was
    not able to speak English such that the public interest  recognised  in
    s.117B(2) of the 2002 Act was engaged.

44. I accept that the public interest  is,  albeit  to  a  limited  extent,
    engaged in this appeal.  However, the appellant  has  established  that
    she meets the requirements of  the  'bereaved  partner'  provisions  in
    Appendix FM.  She has private life in the UK established over a  period
    of nine years, including with her now deceased husband.  That  was  the
    basis of the grant of DL in  2013.   Her  route  to  settlement,  as  a
    partner whether under the Rules or through an extension and application
    of the DL policy applicable to her, has been frustrated by the loss  of
    her husband.  Whilst, as Judge Powell recognised, little  evidence  has
    been adduced  on  the  appellant's  behalf,  the  public  interest  is,
    however, weak in this case.  The appellant is entitled to  leave  under
    the Rules but her appeal both to the First-tier Tribunal and now to the
    Upper Tribunal is limited to human rights grounds.  The mere fact  that
    she can meet the requirements of the Rules does not necessarily lead to
    the conclusion that a refusal of leave is a breach of Art  8.   It  is,
    however, a very significant factor which has to be weighed against  the
    weak public interest in this appeal.  The bereaved  partner  provisions
    reflect the continuing importance of the  surviving  partner's  private
    life being respected in the  UK  after  the  death  of  their  partner.
    Taking all those matters into account, and seeking  to  strike  a  fair
    balance between the public interest and the appellant's private life in
    the UK, I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities  that  the  public
    interest is outweighed by  the  consequences  to  the  appellant  of  a
    decision which refuses to recognise  her  entitlement  to  leave  as  a
    bereaved partner.

45. For those reasons, I allow the appellant's appeal under Art  8  of  the
    ECHR.

Decision

46. For the above reasons, the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to
    dismiss the appellant's appeal under Art 8 involved the  making  of  an
    error of law.  That decision is set aside.

47. I re-make the decision allowing the appellant's appeal under Art 8.

                                                                      Signed

                                                                       [pic]

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

This was an appeal which, in my judgment, should have been allowed by  Judge
Powell and one in which it is appropriate to make a fee  award  of  any  fee
paid or payable in this case.

                                                                      Signed

                                                                       [pic]
                                                                     A Grubb
                                                 Judge of the Upper Tribunal
                                                            6, December 2017
