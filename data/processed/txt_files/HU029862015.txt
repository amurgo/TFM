Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr S Kotas, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    The appellant's sponsor


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   At the hearing there  was  no  legal  representative  who  appeared  on
    behalf of the appellant but there was an appearance by his brother  and
    sponsor, [BF], who is a British citizen and a serving soldier.

2.   The respondent (hereafter the claimant) is a citizen of  Dominica  born
    in 1988.  When he attended the British Embassy in Barbados on 6 May for
    his appointment, he was informed by the Submission Officer that he  had
    completed the incorrect form and so would have to return  to  Dominica.
    The officer allowed him to  complete  another  application.   This  new
    application was for family reunion.  On 17 July 2015  the  ECO  refused
    the appellant's application under  the  refugee  family  reunion  rules
    (paragraphs 352A - 352FI).

    The appellant appealed.  In a decision sent on 10 March 2016 First-tier
    Tribunal (FtT) Judge Kempton allowed his appeal "only  to  the  limited
    extent of remitting the matter to the [ECO] to reconsider the  decision
    under the correct Immigration Rules".  The judge in his decision stated
    that there had been a clear error on the part of the Submission Officer
    in advising the appellant to make a new application on the  basis  that
    the sponsor is a refugee (the sponsor was  not  a  refugee)  and  as  a
    result of this erroneous advice the sponsor has been left ï¿½700  out  of
    pocket to no end.  The judge said it was clear from the outset that the
    appellant wanted to make an application as a dependent relative.


3.   The ECO's grounds of appeal were that having found  the  appellant  and
    the sponsor have twice  submitted  the  wrong  application,  the  judge
    should have dismissed the appeal.

    In my judgement the grounds are correct to state that it was  not  open
    to the judge to allow the appeal.  That was for two  reasons.   One  is
    that as a result of changes introduced by  the  Immigration  Act  2014,
    there was at the date the appellant brought his  appeal,  no  available
    ground of appeal of "not in accordance with the  law".   The  other  is
    that the appeal could only lie against the refusal  decision  and  that
    was  the  refusal  made  in  relation  to  a  refugee  family   reunion
    application. Appeal against that refusal was bound to  fail.  For  that
    reason I have no alternative but to allow the ECO's grounds  of  appeal
    against the FtT Judge's decision.


    However, I share the serious  concerns  of  the  FtT  Judge  about  the
    apparent procedures adopted by the ECO in  Barbados.   I  do  not  have
    sufficient information to be categorical,  but  on  the  basis  of  the
    documentation before me, it seems clear that the appellant should  have
    been advised by the Submission Officer to  make  an  application  as  a
    dependent relative.  (Indeed I cannot exclude that the appellant did in
    fact submit an application as a dependent relative in  advance  of  the
    ECO decision.)


4.   Mr Kotas said that if the appellant wished  to  apply  as  a  dependent
    relative he could still do so by paying a (further) fee.   I  would  be
    very surprised if the independent monitor of  entry  clearance  or  the
    ombudsman office were to consider that correct administrative practice.
     Given that the Submission Office was prepared to allow  the  appellant
    to submit a different application without payment of a further  fee  on
    the last occasion, but gave wrongly advice as to  the  nature  of  that
    application, I do not how the appellant should be required to pay a new
    fee now.  Be that as it may, on the evidence before me the  applicant's
    original application was clearly intended to be  for  settlement  as  a
    dependent relative and I do not understand why the ECO did not classify
    it as such.

    I make the above observation in order to assist the process of  what  I
    hope will be a fresh review by the Entry Clearance Manager.  From  what
    the appellant's brother says, it may be that the appellant should  also
    be advised as to how to make an application to enter the UK  to  enlist
    as a member of the armed forces.


    For the above reasons, the appeal of the ECO against  the  decision  of
    the FtT judge is allowed. The decision I re-make can only be to dismiss
    the appellant's appeal.

No anonymity direction is made.
