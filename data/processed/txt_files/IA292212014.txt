For the respondent:    Mr Dwnycz, Senior Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1. The appellant is a national  of  India  born  on  21  January  1987.   He
   appeals to the Upper Tribunal against the  determination  of  Immigration
   Judge AW Khan dated 18 November 2014  refusing  his  appeal  against  the
   decision of the respondent refusing him further leave to remain as a Tier
   1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant under the points based system.


2. Permission to appeal was initially refused by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
   JM Holmes on 28 January 2015 but granted by a Judge Reeds  of  the  Upper
   Tribunal, on 14 May 2015. He was of the view that it  was  arguable  that
   the Judge may have erred by failing to apply the decision of AA the  SSHD
   [2010] EWCA Civ  773  and  Ahmed  (general  grounds  of  refusal-material
   nondisclosure) [2011] UKUT 351 as the Judge made no finding of  deception
   nor was any consideration  given  to  the  contents  of  the  appellant's
   statement by reference to the explanatory statement of the  Secretary  of
   State and also his claim that the conviction was spent.


3. The Judge in his determination made the following findings in  dismissing
   the appellant's appeal pursuant to the Immigration Rules.  At  section  2
   part E of the application form for a Tier 1 (entrepreneur),  there  is  a
   section about disclosing any  criminal  convictions.  The  appellant  has
   clearly failed to mention the fact that not  only  was  he  convicted  of
   driving a motor vehicle without insurance but also the fact that  he  was
   disqualified  from  driving.  The  appellant's  explanation   is   wholly
   inadequate in that he miss read the  application,  misunderstood  it  and
   became confused. The Judge was "entirely satisfied  that  the  respondent
   was correct  in  respect  of  the  decision  to  refuse  the  appellant's
   application under paragraph 322 (1A) of  the  Immigration  Rules  because
   material facts were not disclosed in the  application".  The  Judge  also
   found that the appellant has failed to produce a letter from a  financial
   institution holding the funds to confirm the amount of money available to
   him as required  under  paragraph  41-SD  in  respect  of  the  specified
   documents in provision (d) in the first row of Table 4 of Appendix  A  of
   the Rules for having access to ï¿½50,000.


4. The Judge dismissed the appeal both under the relevant Immigration  Rules
   and paragraph 322 (1A).

5. The appellant grounds of appeal only pertain to paragraph  322  (1A)  and
   are as follows. On 6 June 2014 the appellant applied for leave to  remain
   as a Tier  1  (entrepreneur)  Migrant.  The  respondent  finds  that  the
   appellant failed to disclose the fact that he was convicted  of  using  a
   vehicle uninsured for which he received a fine and was also  disqualified
   from driving for six months. The respondent alleges  that  this  material
   fact was not disclosed in his application and therefore  the  application
   was dismissed primarily under paragraph 322 (1A).

6. The Judge found that the appellant clearly failed to mention the fact  of
   his  conviction.  The  appellant's  explanation  that  he   misread   the
   application, misunderstood it and became confused to be wholly inadequate
   is an error. The authority for general grounds of refusal on  the  aspect
   of material nondisclosure is Ahmed. The Judge dismissed  the  appellant's
   appeal and said nothing or assessed the appellant's state of  mind  which
   was relevant to this aspect of the Rule. It is  pertinent  to  note  that
   even if the appellant had given this information in his  application,  it
   would not have affected his application adversely. The appellant  had  no
   dishonest intention or any intention to deceive. All aspects of paragraph
   322 (1A) and its sister paragraph 320 (7 A), 321 (i) and 320 1A  (2)  are
   treated as deception under paragraph 6 of  the  Immigration  Rules  which
   strongly implies that mens rea is required on the part of the  applicant.
   The Judge did not consider the element  of  mens  rea  or  any  dishonest
   intention in this case. This amounts to the error of law.

7. The respondent  in  her  rule  24  response  stated  the  following.  The
   respondent will argue that the Judge directed himself appropriately.  The
   appellant declined to fully engage with the appellant process and  sought
   a paper hearing. The Judge was deprived of the appellant's oral  evidence
   in assessing the appellant's appeal. The Judge  was  wholly  entitled  to
   conclude for the reasons given that he did  not  accept  the  appellant's
   explanation for the Permission of the conviction in his application form.
   The grounds amount to a disagreement with the decision.

8. At the hearing, Mr Shah on behalf of the appellant said  that  the  Judge
   was highly critical of the actions of the appellant  and  that  it  never
   dawned on him that refusal for  deception  will  affect  his  immigration
   history adversely. He said that it was foolish for the appellant  not  to
   attend the hearing and to ask for it to be determined on the papers.  The
   Judge had to be sure that the appellant has used deception. Mens  rea  is
   required when analysing paragraph 322 (1A).

9. The Home Office presenting officer stated that he relies on the  Rule  24
   response. He said that this was a paper appeal  and  the  appellant  said
   that his conviction was "spent". He said that mens rea  is  difficult  to
   prove. The appellant crossed the box "no" in his  application  about  his
   conviction. He accepted however that the Judge did not  make  a  distinct
   finding that the appellant had been dishonest.

      The error of law decision

10. This appeal was dismissed on the papers pursuant to the request made  by
   the appellant. The grounds of appeal only refer to the appellant's appeal
   being dismissed under paragraph 322 (1A). There was  no  issue  that  the
   appellant did not meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules  because
   it was accepted that the correct documents were  not  supplied  with  his
   applications. The appeal therefore  was  refused  under  The  Immigration
   Rules and no issue has been taken with this.

11. The only issue, which is the subject of the appeal, is  the  appellant's
   failure to disclose his conviction for driving without insurance and  his
   consequent disqualification from driving in June 2013. The Judge rejected
   the  appellant's  explanation  that  he  had  "misread  the  application,
   misunderstood it  and  became  confused".  However,  the  judge  did  not
   consider or make any finding as to whether the appellant was dishonest as
   it was incumbent upon him to do.



12. in the case of Ahmed it was found that  in  order  to  have  made  false
   representations or submitted false documents so as to attract a mandatory
   refusal under Part 9 of the Immigration Rules,  an  applicant  must  have
   deliberately practised 'Deception', as defined  at  para  6.  Failing  to
   disclose a material fact is also classed as 'Deception'.  It follows that
   such failure also requires dishonesty on the part of the applicant, or by
   someone acting on his behalf.

13. I find that the Judge made a material error of law  in  his  failure  to
   make a finding whether the appellant used deception in his application by
   failing to disclose his conviction and disqualification from driving.

14. I therefore remit  this  appeal  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  so  that
   findings of fact can be made as to whether the appellant  used  deception
   in his application when he failed to disclose his conviction for  driving
   without insurance and a suspension  from  driving  for  six  months.  The
   appeal be placed before any Judge other than First-tier Tribunal Judge AW
   Khan, on the first available date.



DECISION

Appeal be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal
