Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr P Turner, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Ms A Everett, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant is a citizen of India.  In a decision sent on  5  October
    2018 Judge O'Hagan of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (FtT)  dismissed  his
    appeal against the decision of  the  respondent  dated  22  March  2018
    refusing leave to remain.

2.   The first ground on the basis of which the appellant was successful  in
    obtaining a grant of  permission  was  that  the  judge  had  erred  in
    dismissing the appeal albeit accepting that the  appellant  might  meet
    the requirements of the Rules if he made a fresh  application  or  from
    outside the country.  It was  submitted  that  there  was  no  rational
    reason to require him to return to India to  make  an  entry  clearance
    application and so the decision was contrary to the principles set  out
    in Chikwamba [2008] UKHL 40 and subsequent cases such as  Hayat  [2012]
    EWCA Civ 1054 and Agyarko [2017] UKSC 11.  Despite Mr Turner's  valiant
    efforts to advance this ground, I am not persuaded that it is made out.
     My principal reasons for so concluding  are  firstly  that  the  judge
    clearly  did  not  accept  that  the  appellant  met  the  (in-country)
    Immigration Rules presently and very expressly found that the appellant
    had not shown that there  would  be  any  insurmountable  obstacles  to
    family life taking place in India.  At most the judge was  prepared  to
    accept that the appellant "would now satisfy paragraph GEN.1.2 were  he
    to reapply" (paragraph 34).  Meeting that requirement would not suffice
    to succeed under the Rules.  Secondly the judge expressly fell short of
    expressing a view as to whether the appellant, if he returned to India,
    and applied for entry clearance  as  a  partner,  would  be  likely  to
    succeed.  At paragraph 46 the judge stated:

         "I have also considered the point raised by  Ms  Turner  that  this
         case falls within the ambit of the principles set out in  Chikwamba
         [2008] UKHL 41 and Hayat [2011] EWCA  1054.   Ms  Turner  submitted
         that, if an application were to be made from abroad, there  was  no
         reason why it would not be successful.  Maybe so, but equally maybe
         not.  I do not know whether an application made from  abroad  would
         succeed, and it is not appropriate for me to speculate.  What I can
         say with confidence is that this case is not one of  those  limited
         number where it is clear than application would  succeed,  and  the
         requirement that someone return to make one is  a  matter  of  form
         over substance.  The position addressed in Chikwamba [2008] UKHL 41
         and Hayat [2011] EWCA 1054 applies in a small number of cases,  and
         is not the norm."

3.   The appellant's second ground targets  the  judge's  treatment  of  the
    issue of whether  he  had  shown  compelling  Article  8  circumstances
    outside the  Rules.   It  was  submitted  that  the  judge's  erroneous
    approach to the appellant's situation within  the  Rules  infected  his
    approach  to  the  issue  of  whether  there  would  be  insurmountable
    obstacles in the way of him and his wife restarting their  family  life
    in India.  It was emphasised that she is a British citizen,  had  lived
    in the UK since aged 7, had her whole family here, that she looks after
    her father, was of  good  character,  was  financially  self-sufficient
    (earning ï¿½19,000 per annum) and has accommodation.

4.   Mr Turner also criticised the judge for referring in paragraph 34 to  a
    "thought experiment".

5.   Dealing with the last point first, it seems to me that in referring  to
    a "thought experiment" all the judge was meaning to say, infelicitously
    expressed as it may have been, was that  in  order  to  assess  whether
    there were  compelling  circumstances  outside  the  Rules  he  had  to
    consider the extent to which the appellant  met  some  or  all  of  the
    requirements of the Rules.  That exercise was  unexceptionable,  indeed
    incumbent on the judge to undertake  as  part  of  the  proportionality
    assessment.

6.   As regards the contention that the judge erred in assessing  the  issue
    of  insurmountable  obstacles  (and  that  this  error  "infected"  his
    assessment outside the Rules), the decision exhibits sound reasons  for
    concluding that the appellant had not shown  insurmountable  obstacles.
    The judge weighed in the appellant's favour that (in addition to  being
    a British citizen) his wife has not lived in India since she was 7  and
    that she has established friendships and employment here.  However,  in
    the judge's assessment these failures were outweighed by the fact  that
    (like the appellant) his wife was of Indian origin, she speaks Punjabi,
    that she would be seeking a new life in India with the support  of  her
    husband and his family, that she is educated and able and could  adapt,
    and that she does not have health problems.  The judge also noted  that
    the appellant's immigration status was precarious when he met Mrs  Kaur
    and  that  he  has  made  some  use  of  public  funds.   The   judge's
    proportionality assessment was entirely within the range of  reasonable
    responses.

7.   The judge also  addressed  the  circumstances  of  Mrs  Kaur's  father,
    stating at paragraph 40 that:

         "In respect of Mrs Kaur's father, I accept that she loves him,  and
         helps in his  care.   Whilst  I  accept  that,  they  do  not  live
         together.   He  lives  alone.   That  suggests  that,  despite  his
         disabilities,  he  is  able  to  enjoy  a  reasonable   degree   of
         independence.  She is not the only family member who helps him.  On
         her account, the care is shared with her brother.   The  time  that
         she is able to give will necessarily be limited by the  demands  of
         her work, her relationship with her husband,  and  the  demands  of
         running her own household jointly  with  her  husband.   There  are
         other family members in the country who can help."

8.   To some extent, straddling grounds 1 and 2, Mr Turner sought  to  argue
    that the judge filed to  properly  address  the  Chikwamba  issue.   He
    contends that the judge's treatment  at  paragraph  46  amounted  to  a
    failure to address the issue.  I  disagree.   The  judge  made  express
    reference to case law authority and on the evidence  before  the  judge
    this was not a case where the appellant could be seen to meet  all  the
    out-of-country  requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules  relating  to
    partners.  Further and in particular (and unlike the  factual  scenario
    in Chikwamba), this was not a case where it  would  be  unrealistic  to
    expect the spouse to accompany the appellant to his country of origin.

9.   For the above reasons I conclude that the judge did not materially  err
    in law and accordingly his decision to dismiss the  appellant's  appeal
    must stand.

No anonymity direction is made.
