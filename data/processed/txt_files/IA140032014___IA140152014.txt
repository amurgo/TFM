                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. The Appellants born on 5th September 1978 and 4th January 1983 are both
    citizens of Nigeria.  The Appellants were represented by Mr Afsal.  The
    Respondent was represented by Mr McVeety, a Presenting Officer.

Substantive Issues under Appeal

 2. The Appellants who are husband and wife had made application for  leave
    to remain in the United Kingdom as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant  and
    his dependent.  The applications had been  refused  by  the  Respondent
    under paragraph 245DD(h) of the Immigration Rules and  under  paragraph
    319C(b) of the Immigration Rules in respect of  the  Second  Appellant.
    The Appellants had appealed that decision and  their  appeal  had  been
    heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge Devlin sitting at Manchester on  5th
    June 2014.  He had dismissed their appeals both under  the  Immigration
    Rules and on human rights grounds.

 3. Application for permission to appeal had been made  and  permission  to
    appeal had been granted by Designated First-tier Tribunal Judge  Zucker
    on 5th September 2014.  He noted the grounds  included  the  submission
    that the judge had failed to state the standard of proof being  applied
    and further noted that although the Appellants would have a very  steep
    hill to climb in the appeal and ordinarily would not have found  errors
    identified because of the manner in which the judge had  expressed  his
    concerns at paragraph 54, it was said that it was  arguable  the  judge
    had applied the wrong standard of proof.  Directions  were  issued  for
    the matter to be heard by the Upper Tribunal firstly to decide  whether
    or not an error of law had been made and the matter comes before me  in
    accordance with those directions.

Submissions on behalf of the Appellant

 4. Mr Afsal referred me to paragraph 54 and  further  stated  that  at  no
    stage had the judge outlined the burden and standard of proof  in  such
    cases.  Central to his submissions were that the judge had made a basic
    mistake in that he had made findings going behind the fact  that  there
    were funds within the bank account and such findings were  unnecessary.
    Essentially he submitted that it was  not  necessary  to  look  at  the
    sources of funds and that was the main problem in the decision.

Submissions on behalf of the Respondent

 5. Mr McVeety referred me to the decision and noted it was  necessary  for
    the judge to be satisfied that funds were genuinely  available.   There
    were two separate funds in this case and it was submitted the judge had
    for proper reasons given found that he was not  satisfied  those  funds
    were genuinely available.  Further for reasons provided  he  had  found
    that the business plan had clearly been  plagiarised  but  for  reasons
    given at paragraph  87  onwards  the  Appellants  had  not  outlined  a
    credible business plan or had carried out any meaningful research.   He
    submitted the judge was entitled to reach those conclusions.

 6. At the conclusion of the submissions I reserved my decision to consider
    the matter and now provide that decision with my reasons.





Decision and Reasons

 7. The judge in this case  had  provided  a  very  detailed  determination
    running to 119 paragraphs.  He had identified the relevant  Immigration
    Rule as being paragraph 245DD and that paragraph 6 of the decision  set
    out the requirements of that paragraph .  In particular, and germane to
    this case he had set out paragraph 245DD  sub-paragraph  (h)  and  sub-
    paragraph (i) which in themselves make  reference  to  the  appropriate
    standard of  proof  applicable  in  such  cases  namely  a  balance  of
    probability.  The judge for the sake of completeness at paragraph 7 had
    also set out in its entirety the Respondent's reasons for refusing  the
    First Appellant's application which concerned factors within  paragraph
    245DD(i) namely in making the assessment in (h) the Secretary of  State
    will assess the balance of probabilities and may take into account  the
    following factors namely:

    (i)  the evidence the applicant has submitted;

    (ii) the viability and credibility of the source of the monies referred
         to; and

    (iii)    the viability and  credibility  of  the  applicant's  business
         plans and market research into their chosen sector.

    It is quite clear therefore that the judge had at the forefront of  his
    mind the essential  basis  upon  which  the  Respondent  had  not  been
    satisfied with the First Appellant's application and  the  standard  of
    proof in assessing the evidence presented.

 8. There  were  two  sources  of  income  within  accounts  that  required
    consideration in light of the Respondent's refusal.  There was a  small
    amount of �1,540 and the larger amount of �44,500.

 9. Mr Afsal's submissions were principally based on  the  fact  that  once
    evidence of those monies being available or within an account had  been
    established it was neither necessary or incumbent  upon  the  judge  to
    have enquired further.  There may well have been a time at  the  advent
    of the introduction of the Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Rules where  the  mere
    presence of the requisite sum of money  in  an  account  was  all  that
    needed to be proved.  However the Immigration  Rules  were  changed  or
    enlarged after a period of  time  to  require  rather  more  or  closer
    examination than simply the fact of monies  being  within  an  account.
    That no doubt followed from knowledge and experience that  the  earlier
    and  simpler  requirements  were  or  had  been  open  to  abuse.   The
    Immigration Rules are clear and the reasons  for  refusal  specifically
    set out by the Respondent.  The judge correctly had therefore looked at
    those two separate sources of money in light of  the  two  elements  of
    dissatisfaction expressed by the Respondent  in  line  with  paragraphs
    245DD(i)(i) and (ii).  The judge had set out in detail and with clarity
    his findings and reasons in respect of those two sums of money.  He had
    found at paragraph  29  that  he  accepted  letters  demonstrating  the
    presence of monies in the accounts as being genuine and accurate and at
    paragraph 30 therefore concluded that  the  Respondent's  first  reason
    namely the refusal under paragraph  245DD(i)(i)  was  not  sustainable.
    Thereafter from paragraph 31 onwards he had looked at the  Respondent's
    second basis of dissatisfaction under (ii)  namely  the  viability  and
    credibility of the sources of the monies referred to.  He was not  only
    entitled to conduct that exercise but it was incumbent upon him  so  to
    do to deal fully with the reasons for refusal and  in  accordance  with
    the Immigration Rules.

10. He had between paragraphs 31 and 83 examined the  Respondent's  concern
    raised under paragraph 245DD(h)(iii) examined whether  that  money  was
    genuinely available to the applicant and will remain available  to  him
    until such time as it is spent for the  purposes  of  his  business  or
    businesses.  He had for reasons provided and  well-explained  concluded
    that the monies were not genuinely available to the applicant  or  that
    it would remain available to him until such time as it is spent for the
    purposes of his business or businesses.  Indeed it is  worthy  of  note
    that at paragraph 76 he had specifically noted  Mr  Afsal's  submission
    before him that it was not necessary for  the  Appellant  to  show  the
    provenance of the money but at paragraph 78 had properly indicated that
    the  requirements  of  paragraph  245DD(h)(iii)   provided   that   the
    Respondent must be satisfied that the  money  was  genuinely  available
    etc.  The central  plank  of  Mr  Afsal's  submissions  before  me  and
    contained within his Grounds of Appeal had therefore already been dealt
    with and properly explained by the judge in the First-tier Tribunal.

11. The judge finally had  dealt  with  the  last  concern  raised  by  the
    Respondent namely the viability  and  credibility  of  the  applicant's
    business plans under paragraph 245DD(i)(iii).  He had at  paragraph  84
    outlined the three reasons  given  by  the  Respondent  for  not  being
    satisfied with that business  plan  and  market  research.   The  judge
    between paragraphs 84 and 109 had then looked at those concerns raised.
     The judge had noted that  one  of  the  reasons  given  was  that  the
    Appellant's business plan had clearly been plagiarised from a  business
    plan available from an internet website.   The  judge  noted  that  the
    Respondent had produced a copy of the relevant  web  page.   The  judge
    dealing fairly with this point had commented at paragraph  87  that  of
    itself the use of a business plan template is not something from  which
    he would ordinarily have drawn an adverse  inference.   Indeed  he  had
    referred to the case of Baylan [2012] UKUT 83 where the Upper  Tribunal
    had dealt with this point.  However he had also noted that in this case
    the Appellant had specifically stated within his witness statement that
    he had not copied the business plan from any website and  had  prepared
    it himself as he was fully qualified to do.  The judge  thereafter  had
    given reasons why he did not accept  that  explanation  and  found  the
    Respondent's reason for refusal in that respect to have had  substance.
    He had then  considered  the  Respondent's  further  reasons  that  the
    business plan was extremely vague and provided no details as to how the
    Appellant claimed he would realistically achieve a growth rate of  900%
    over two years.  The judge assessed both the documentary  evidence  and
    the Appellant's oral evidence in that respect  and  again  for  reasons
    properly given found the Respondent's second reason to be well-founded.
     He also found the Respondent's third reason as to  how  the  Appellant
    would target existing customers or  attract  new  customers  to  be  an
    unsatisfactory response.  Again the judge had found for  reasons  given
    that this concern raised by the Respondent was well-founded.  There was
    a typing error at paragraph 109 of the decision where the judge had put
    the word Appellant rather than Respondent  but  that  typing  error  is
    manifestly clear from the context of that and preceding paragraphs.  In
    summary the judge had found that  the  Appellant  failed  to  meet  the
    requirements of paragraph 245DD(h)(i)  and  (iii)  and  had  not  on  a
    balance of  probability  satisfied  under  paragraph  245DD(i)(ii)  and
    (iii).  He had given clear and  detailed  reasons  for  reaching  those
    conclusions based both on the documentary and oral evidence before him.
     They were conclusions he was entitled to reach and no error of law was
    disclosed in the manner in which those conclusions were reached.

12. In respect of paragraph 54 specifically  noted  in  the  permission  to
    appeal the judge had said in that paragraph "for all of these reasons I
    find that I have  genuine  doubts  as  to  the  source  of  the  �1,540
    deposited in the Appellant's current account  on  10th January  2014".
    That phraseology does not in itself necessarily demonstrate  the  judge
    was unaware of the burden and standard of proof in this  case.   It  is
    also necessary when such assertions  are  made  to  have  regard  to  a
    decision read as a whole.  It is clear the judge had in  his  mind  the
    correct burden and standard of proof.  Whilst he may not have set out a
    specific paragraph outlining  the  burden  and  standard  of  proof  in
    immigration cases it is not necessarily incumbent upon him  so  to  do.
    It seems  a  unique  feature  of  this  jurisdiction  that  judges  are
    criticised  on  occasions  for  not  repeating  verbatim  such  matters
    particularly when it is clear on a reading of a  decision  as  a  whole
    that a judge has applied the correct test.

13. Finally in terms of Article 8 the judge dealt with that matter  briefly
    as he was entitled to do given the failure of the  Appellants  to  meet
    the Immigration Rules, the fact there would  be  no  interference  with
    family life and the fact, as noted by the judge at  paragraph  118,  no
    evidence of private life in terms of its  nature  or  extent  had  been
    provided by the Appellants.

Notice of Decision

14. There was no error of law made by the judge in this case and  I  uphold
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.
