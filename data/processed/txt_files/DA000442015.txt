For the Respondent:    Mr P R Collings, Counsel, instructed by Caulkner &
Co, solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Secretary of State appeals with permission against the decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal allowing  the  claimant's  appeal  against  her
    decision to remove him to  Spain  pursuant  to  Regulation  21  of  the
    Immigration (European Economic Area)  Regulations  2006  (as  amended).
    The claimant is a Spanish citizen.



Preliminary issue

 2. There was a preliminary issue in relation  to  a  bundle  of  documents
    filed by the claimant's solicitors shortly before the hearing. The Home
    Office Presenting Officer was disadvantaged, having had no  opportunity
    to prepare to deal with the new bundle,  despite  the  plain  direction
    given with the notice of hearing that  'The  Upper  Tribunal  will  not
    consider evidence which was not before the First-tier  Tribunal  unless
    the Upper Tribunal has specifically decided to admit that evidence' and
    in the accompanying Directions, that:

         "2.  The parties are reminded of the need to  make  an  application
         pursuant to rule 15(2A) of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)
         Rules 2008, where appropriate, and  of  the  requirements  of  that
         Rule:

             (2A) In an asylum case or an immigration case -

             (a)  If a party wishes the Upper Tribunal to consider evidence
             that was not before the First-tier Tribunal, that  party  must
             send or deliver a notice to the Upper Tribunal and  any  other
             party -

                  (i)  Indicating the nature of the evidence; and

                  (ii) Explaining why it was not submitted to the First-tier
                  Tribunal; and

             (b)  When considering whether to admit evidence that  was  not
             before the First-tier Tribunal, the Upper Tribunal  must  have
             regard  to  whether  there  has  been  unreasonable  delay  in
             producing that evidence.".

 3. No such notice had been prepared or served.  The  information  required
    by paragraph 15(2A)(a) was not available.  We received  no  explanation
    either of the bundle's late production, or of the  failure  to  produce
    its contents before the First-tier Tribunal.

 4. Mr Collins accepted that in the circumstances, the  Tribunal  would  be
    entitled to refuse to admit the additional bundle.  He told us that the
    contents of the new bundle was mainly  a  repetition  of  the  evidence
    already produced, together with a statement from the claimant's partner
    in which she set out the unsuccessful efforts she had made to find more
    traces of integrating links to the United Kingdom for this claimant.

 5. It seems, therefore, that the documents would have added very little of
    relevance to the appeal: we are quite prepared to accept  that  it  has
    not been possible to produce more evidence of  integrative  links.   We
    refused to admit the  documents,  which  we  did  not  consider  to  be
    relevant to the error of law under consideration.

Error of law

 6. The First-tier Tribunal, when allowing  this  appeal,  applied  to  the
    claimant the highest level of protection for EEA citizens as set out in
    paragraph 21(4)(a) (the 'imperative ground'), which requires 10  years'
    continuous residence in accordance with the Regulations before the date
    when  the  relevant  decision  (the  removal  decision).   The   proper
    application of that test was clarified Court of Justice in Secretary of
    State for the Home Department v MG  (Judgments  of  the  court]  [2014]
    EUECJ C400/12 which was published on 16 January 2014

         "1.  On a proper  construction  of  Article  28(23A)  of  Directive
             2004/38EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of  28
             April 2004 ... the ten year period of residence referred to in
             that provision must in principle be  continuous  and  must  be
             calculated by counting back from the date of the decision  ...
             the expulsion of the person concerned.

         2.   Article 28(3)(a) of Directive 2004/38 must be  interpreted  as
             meaning this period of imprisonment is in principle capable of
             both of interpreting the continuity of the period of residence
             for the purposes of  that  provisions  and  of  affecting  the
             decision  regarding  the  grant  of  the  enhanced  protection
             provided for hereunder even where the person concerned resided
             in  the  host  member  state  for  the  10  years   prior   to
             imprisonment. However the fact that that person resided in the
             host member state for years prior to imprisonment may be taken
             into consideration as part of the overall assessment  required
             in order to determine whether the integrating links previously
             forged with the host member state had been broken."

 7. It is not now in dispute that the First-tier Tribunal erred in  law  by
    erroneously calculating the qualifying period of 10 years forward  from
    the date of the claimant's  putative  arrival  in  the  United  Kingdom
    rather than backwards from the removal decision.   Having  applied  the
    wrong test the First-tier Tribunal erroneously reached  the  conclusion
    that the imperative test was applicable.

 8. Given the lower standard of EEA Regulations protection available  under
    Regulation 21(1) and  21(2),  we  are  satisfied  that  such  error  is
    material to the outcome of the appeal.  We set aside the  decision  and
    now proceed to remake it.

Factual matrix

 9. The factual matrix in this appeal is as follows:

      a) The claimant claims to have arrived in the United Kingdom  sometime
         in the early to mid-1970s, having been born in Spain in  1970.   By
         1979, the Spanish consulate was aware of his presence, and that  of
         his father, in the United Kingdom.  We  have  before  us  a  letter
         confirming that. The claimant is a healthy man, now age 45, with  a
         British citizen partner and two children aged 10 and 7.

      b) Apart from his criminal history, those are almost the only official
         traces of the claimant's presence here in the 40 years he  says  he
         has spent in the United Kingdom.  There are no  extant  records  of
         his schooling  and  no  records  of  his  paying  tax  or  National
         Insurance until 2003/4.  The claimant's partner has tried  hard  to
         find more traces of his residence in the  United  Kingdom  but  has
         been unsuccessful.  There is no reliable evidence that he spent all
         of that time living in the United Kingdom at all.

      c) In 1986 two things happened.  The claimant  was  convicted  of  the
         offence of actual bodily harm and was fined �100.  He was then,  on
         his account, working as an apprentice carpenter, but that was short-
         lived.  The claimant had a car accident and was out of work  for  6
         or 7 years.

      d) At the earliest, on his own evidence,  the  claimant  resumed  some
         kind of employment in 1992 or 1993, working 'cash in hand' at first
         and filing neither tax nor National Insurance returns until 2003/4.
          He did so for 2 years only, then stopped again.

      e) The claimant's parents in Spain are said to be deceased. He has two
         brothers and two sisters in the United Kingdom who  have  not  seen
         him  since  he  went  to  prison  in  2009.   The  claimant  has  a
         relationship with the mother of his  children  and  they  have  two
         children together. The elder child was born in  November  2005  and
         the younger in November  2008:  both  they  and  their  mother  are
         British citizens. The claimant is not married to his partner.

      f) On  1  July  2009  the  claimant  was  arrested  and  charged  with
         possession of �100,000  of  cocaine  with  intent  to  supply,  and
         possession of criminal property, �51,000 in cash  which  he  stated
         belonged to others, and which the sentencing judge considered to be
         likely to be the proceeds of drug dealing  by  others.   His  elder
         child was then 3 years old, and his younger child was 7 months old.

      g) The claimant pleaded  guilty  to  the  drugs  charge  but  not  the
         possession of criminal property offence; he  was  found  guilty  on
         both counts.  On 5 March 2010,  when  sentencing  him  at  Basildon
         Crown Court, the sentencing judge took a very serious view  of  the
         offences.  He considered that the claimant had set  up  as  a  sole
         trader in  the  drugs  business,  not  working  with  others.   The
         claimant was sentenced to 6 years' imprisonment on the  offence  of
         possession with intent to supply and 2� years  on  the  offence  of
         possession of criminal property, to run concurrently.  The claimant
         did not  appeal  thos  sentences.   He  was  also  ordered  to  pay
         compensation of �300,000, but it is unclear whether he did so.

      h) The Secretary of State accepted in  her  refusal  letter  that  the
         relationship between the appellant and his British citizen  partner
         and children was genuine and subsisting, but considered that it was
         proportionate to remove him to Spain and that it was a  matter  for
         the claimant and his partner whether they went together or  whether
         he  maintained  his  links  by  visits  and   modern   methods   of
         communication, which was the case while he was in prison.

      i) The children, who are now are now 10 years and 7  years  old,  have
         not seen the claimant while he was in prison.  He spoke to them  by
         telephone several times a week during his incarceration,  but  they
         were unaware that he was in prison, according to the  claimant  and
         his partner.

      j) The claimant was released from prison on 15  June  2015,  when  his
         criminal sentence ended.  He did  not  attend  the  appeal  hearing
         before us.

      k) The claimant's partner has a sister living  in  Spain,  who  has  a
         successful business.  That  sister  speaks  Spanish:  the  claimant
         claims not to speak Spanish but accepts that he would  be  able  to
         learn it as an adult.  The claimant's family visited his  partner's
         sister for a week at some point before the claimant went to prison.
         For the claimant, Mr Collins accepted that English is widely spoken
         in Spain and that therefore, the claimant would not be likely to be
         in serious difficulty even if he were unable to learn Spanish  once
         removed to his country of origin.

Discussion

10. Regulation 21 so far as relevant is as follows:

         "21. (1)      In this regulation a "relevant decision" means an EEA
         decision taken on the grounds of public policy, public security  or
         public health.

         (2)  A relevant decision may not be taken to serve economic ends.

         (3)  A relevant decision may not be taken in respect  of  a  person
         with a permanent right of residence under regulation 15  except  on
         serious grounds of public policy or public security. ...

         (5)  Where a relevant decision is taken on grounds of public policy
         or public security it shall, in  addition  to  complying  with  the
         preceding paragraphs of this regulation,  be  taken  in  accordance
         with the following principles-

             (a)   the  decision  must  comply  with   the   principle   of
             proportionality;

             (b)  the decision must be based exclusively  on  the  personal
             conduct of the person concerned;

             (c)   the  personal  conduct  of  the  person  concerned  must
             represent a genuine, present and sufficiently  serious  threat
             affecting one of the fundamental interests of society;

             (d)  matters isolated from the  particulars  of  the  case  or
             which relate to considerations of general  prevention  do  not
             justify the decision;

             (e)  a  person's  previous  criminal  convictions  do  not  in
             themselves justify the decision.

         (6)  Before taking a relevant decision on  the  grounds  of  public
         policy or public security in relation to a person who  is  resident
         in the United Kingdom the  decision  maker  must  take  account  of
         considerations such  as  the  age,  state  of  health,  family  and
         economic situation of the person, the person's length of  residence
         in the United Kingdom, the person's social and cultural integration
         into the United Kingdom and the extent of the person's  links  with
         his country of origin."

11. The Secretary of State's decision was taken on the  grounds  of  public
    policy and public security,  as  Regulation  21(1)  requires.   We  are
    satisfied that it  has  not  been  taken  to  serve  economic  ends  as
    prohibited by Regulation 21(2).

12. We are not satisfied that it is appropriate to apply  Regulation  21(3)
    and treat the claimant as a person with a permanent right of  residence
    under Regulation 15.  The  evidence  of  his  presence  in  the  United
    Kingdom in accordance with the Regulations is very sparse, and does not
    to  the  ordinarily  civil  standard  of   balance   of   probabilities
    demonstrate a continuous period of EEA Regulations  compliant  resident
    for 5 years at any time before the decision to remove.

13. The claimant is of course entitled  to  the  benefit  of  consideration
    under Regulations 21(5) and 21(6).  Regulation 21(5) requires that  the
    decision should comply with the principles of  proportionality  and  be
    based exclusively on the personal  conduct  of  the  person  concerned,
    which must represent a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat
    affecting one of  the  fundamental  interests  of  society.  Regulation
    21(5)(e) states that previous criminal convictions do not in themselves
    justify a decision to remove: the approach required  is  more  holistic
    than that.

14. Drugs offences do represent a sufficiently serious threat to one of the
    fundamental interests of society,  and  in  this  case,  the  drugs  in
    question were  on  the  industrial  scale:  the  claimant  had  in  his
    possession �60,000 worth of cocaine  and  �40,000  in  money.  That  is
    sufficient to affect and  cause  harm  to  a  great  many  people.  The
    sentencing judge in his  remarks  took  a  very  serious  view  of  the
    claimant's offence.  He considered that the  claimant  had  not  merely
    been holding the funds and the cocaine for a friend as he said he  was,
    and that he was in fact a major drug dealer who had had the  misfortune
    to be discovered.  There is before us an OASys Report which, whilst  it
    states  that  there  is  a  low  risk  of  the  claimant   reoffending,
    nevertheless finds that there is  a  17%  risk  of  proven  reoffending
    within two years.  That may be what OASys regards as low but it is  not
    what society would in general regard as a low risk, since it approaches
    a one in five risk of reoffending in less than two years from  release.



15. We consider that the Secretary  of  State's  decision  to  remove  this
    claimant to Spain is proportionate.  It is based not only on the  index
    offence but also has regard to his conduct during his alleged  time  in
    the United Kingdom, which has left barely any official traces.  We know
    that in 1979 the Spanish Embassy was aware of him being in  the  United
    Kingdom; that in 1986, he was here, because he was  the  subject  of  a
    criminal conviction; and that, given that his  children  were  born  in
    2005 and 2008 he must have been here a year or  so  earlier.   We  know
    that he was here in 2009 when he was  arrested,  and  that  thereafter,
    until 2015, he was imprisoned here.

16. Regulation 21(6) requires  the  Secretary  of  State  to  consider  the
    claimant's age, state of health, family and economic situation, what is
    known about his residence in the United  Kingdom  and  his  social  and
    cultural integration and also the extent of his links with his  country
    of origin.  The claimant is a man of middle years, about 45 years  old,
    and in good health as far as is known.   He has served his sentence and
    is currently at liberty in the community, not in immigration detention.
    It is impossible to be clear as to the length of his residence  in  the
    United Kingdom and that he appears  to  have  very  little  social  and
    actual integration here, and  equally  it  is  impossible  to  be  sure
    whether he is telling the truth about the extent of his links with  his
    country of origin.  It would have been of assistance  if  the  claimant
    had been here himself to assist with these matters but  he  has  chosen
    not to attend the hearing, as is his right, and accordingly we  can  do
    no more than to consider the evidence which was before the First-tier.

17. There is no reliable evidence of  the  claimant's  social  or  cultural
    integration into the United Kingdom or  even  that  he  has  been  here
    consistently.  It is entirely possible that  he  has  been  coming  and
    going between the United Kingdom and Spain, or alternatively living  in
    the United Kingdom "below the radar" without any significant attempt to
    integrate himself into British society.

18. The only real point on integration in the United Kingdom  concerns  his
    relationship with his partner and their two children.   The  children's
    relationship with the claimant has been by telephone for most of  their
    lives, with the children unaware that  he  was  telephoning  them  from
    prison.  The Secretary of State did have regard to the relevant factors
    and her reasons for  considering  that  the  interests  of  the  United
    Kingdom outweighed the claimant's family and private life are  set  out
    at paragraph 26 of the decision.

Article 8 ECHR

19. We have considered whether we should have regard  to  part  VA  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002  and  in  particular  to
    paragraph 117B and 117C thereof.  We  note  that  the  appeal  was  not
    allowed on Article 8 ECHR grounds and that Article 8 does not appear to
    have been in issue before the First-tier Tribunal. The claimant has not
    filed a rule 24 Reply engaging Article 8 ECHR and there being no family
    and private life decision by the First-tier Tribunal, the Secretary  of
    State has not appealed such a decision.  We consider that  we  are  not
    seised of any Article 8 point and therefore that  part  5A  is  not  in
    issue in this appeal.

Decision

20. The error of law by the First-tier Tribunal is  plain,  undisputed  and
    material.  When the proper  test  is  applied,  the  claimant's  appeal
    cannot succeed.  We therefore allow the Secretary of State's appeal and
    substitute a decision dismissing  the  claimant's  appeal  against  her
    removal decision under Regulation 21.

Conclusions

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.

We set aside the  decision.  We  re-make  the  decision  in  the  appeal  by
dismissing the claimant's appeal against the Secretary  of  State's  removal
decision.
