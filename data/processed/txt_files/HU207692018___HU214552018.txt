Representation:
For the Appellants:    Ms A Bhachu, Counsel, instructed by Bassi Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms A Everett, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants are a married couple in their 60s; the first  appellant,
    Mr [S], was born in January 1954 and the second appellant, his wife, Ms
    [K], was born in December 1952.  They are Indian nationals and came  to
    England in September 2017, with valid entry visas, in  order  to  visit
    their family in this country, being their son, Mr [PS],  his  wife  and
    their grandson, a British citizen who had been  born  on  27  September
    2012 and whose fifth birthday was due twelve days after  their  arrived
    in the UK.  Their son has indefinite leave to remain and their grandson
    is a British citizen.

 2. It is the appellants' case that when they arrived in this country  they
    fully intended to return to India in accordance with the terms of their
    entry clearance.  The first appellant, Mr [S], was relatively  healthy,
    and although the second appellant had exhibited some signs of dementia,
    it was not by then very advanced and  the  couple  were  able  to  live
    happily and healthily in India.  However, shortly after arriving in the
    UK Mr [S] suffered a severe heart attack; although he was  operated  on
    successfully, he now requires regular medication and suffers from  high
    blood pressure and diabetes.

 3. Although Mr [S] was making a good recovery, very sadly as a  result  of
    his heart attack his wife, the second appellant, has suffered  a  rapid
    decline in her  health,  and  now  in  addition  to  her  dementia,  is
    receiving care for diabetes, hypertension and bronchial asthma, as well
    as receiving mental health care from a psychiatrist  at  the  Community
    Mental Health Team where she lives with her son.

 4. Because of the appellants'  decline  in  health,  which  had  not  been
    anticipated when they arrived in the UK, they were not able  to  return
    and on 23 February 2018 they applied for further leave to remain on the
    grounds that because of the deterioration in their  health  to  require
    them to leave the UK would be a breach of their Article 8 rights.

 5. This application was refused by the respondent on 28 September 2018 and
    following a hearing at Birmingham (Priory Court) on 9  May  2019  their
    appeal was dismissed by First-tier Tribunal Judge Fowell in a  Decision
    and Reasons promulgated thirteen days later on 22 May 2019.

 6. The appellants now appeal against this decision,  having  been  granted
    leave by First-tier Tribunal Judge Jeremey Gibb on 2 August 2019.

 7. The grounds  were  settled  by  Ms  Bhachu,  who  has  been  instructed
    throughout on behalf of  the  appellants  and  she  also  relied  on  a
    skeleton argument which  was  prepared  for  the  hearing  before  this
    Tribunal.  Her essential argument  is  that  Judge  Fowell  essentially
    considered the appellants' case by  having  regard  to  what  would  be
    required for an adult dependant to  be  granted  entry  clearance  from
    outside the country, rather than  by  a  full  consideration  of  their
    Article 8 position.  For this reason, it  is  submitted,  the  emphasis
    within Judge Fowell's consideration was whether or not  the  appellants
    had established that there would be "insurmountable obstacles" to their
    life continuing in India.  At paragraph 3 of the grounds, it is  stated
    as follows:

         "The decision at paragraph  30  and  31  considered  insurmountable
         obstacles to life continuing in India.  Significantly, at paragraph
         42, the test of insurmountable obstacles is considered by reference
         to the public interest question.  Such test has been applied  as  a
         starting point when in fact it  should  not  have  formed  part  of
         Article 8 assessment, considering the appellants did not  fall  for
         consideration under the partner or parent route."

Judge Fowell's Decision

 8. In a detailed and careful Decision, Judge Fowell set out  the  evidence
    which  had  been  before  him.   This  included  the  various   witness
    statements  and  supporting  affidavits,  evidence  relating   to   the
    appellants' family and circumstances in their home area  within  India,
    medical evidence relating to each  of  them,  including  a  psychiatric
    assessment  for  the  second  appellant,  evidence  relating  to  their
    grandson's  progress  at  school   and   evidence   relating   to   the
    accommodation they lived in in the UK  with  their  son,  and  evidence
    relating to his income.   Reference  will  be  made  to  some  of  this
    evidence below.

 9. Judge Fowell summarised the oral evidence which had been given  by  the
    first appellant, who had adopted his witness statement as true.  He had
    three daughters in India, but they lived between 45 and  90  kilometres
    away from their home and so would  not  be  available  to  support  the
    appellants if returned to India.  He  confirmed  that  they  still  had
    their family home in Punjab which was cleaned weekly and that  he  also
    has  four  sisters  there  who  lived  with  their  own  families   and
    grandchildren.

10. The son, Mr [PS] gave  evidence.   In  his  witness  statement  he  had
    explained that his parents had come over to visit at the  time  of  his
    son's fifth birthday and that his father had suffered  a  heart  attack
    which had led to an invoice for �26,412 from the NHS but that  the  son
    had paid �10,000 towards this and was also paying a standing  order  of
    �200 per month to meet the rest.  The treatment would  have  been  much
    cheaper in India.  He also  gave  evidence  relating  to  his  mother's
    condition.  His evidence was confirmed by his wife.

11. Regarding the second appellant's medical condition, this was set out at
    paragraphs 6 and 7 of the decision as follows:

         "6.  The  psychiatric  report  sets  out  to  address  [the  second
             appellant's] mental health needs.  It described her background
             and family in India, with two sisters and one  brother  living
             in Haryana and  Punjab,  although  later  he  mentioned  three
             brothers, and then one who had passed away.  It recorded  that
             she is illiterate and has relied on the support of her husband
             since their marriage, and that she developed dementia in 2017.
              It also said  that  she  had  a  history  of  slow  onset  of
             cognitive dysfunction over the past four years, with  a  rapid
             decline since her visit to her son  in  the  UK  in  September
             2017.

         7.   Under the heading "Presenting  Complaints"  it  describes  her
             situation as follows:

                  "She remains fearful and worried on most  occasions.   She
                  remains withdrawn and preoccupied mostly and gets agitated
                  from time to time.  She is not able to tolerate any degree
                  of separation away from her husband  and  becomes  anxious
                  and distressed very easily.  She is not able  to  register
                  any new information and  recall  them  in  any  meaningful
                  manner.  She is not able to plan forwards  or  follow  any
                  routine on her own in her day-to-day  life.   She  remains
                  passive on most occasions and follow the instructions  and
                  prompts given by her carers on  [a]  regular  basis.   She
                  struggles to cope with any new changes in her  daily  life
                  and tends to become more anxious and agitated  when  faced
                  with new situations.  When left on her own, she  tends  to
                  wander away to unfamiliar places  and  carry  an  elevated
                  risk of harm and developing health complications."

12. Judge Fowell noted that the report had explained how  the  trigger  for
    the second  appellant's  rapid  decline  in  late  2017  had  been  her
    husband's heart attack and the subsequent anxiety  she  had  felt,  and
    also noted that she was also receiving care for diabetes,  hypertension
    and bronchial asthma, as well as mental health care from a psychiatrist
    in the Community Mental Health Team, which overall was considered to be
    "optimal care".

13. Dealing with the evidence of the appellants' son, he recorded that  the
    first appellant would  take  his  grandson  to  school  which  his  son
    considered good exercise for him.

14. The judge set out the submissions made on behalf of the appellants  and
    the respondent which included Ms Bhachu's submission  that  "there  was
    essentially a gap in the Rules which did not cater for situations  such
    as this" (at paragraph 23 of the Decision).

15. Having  set  out  correctly  that  the  starting  point  was  that  the
    appellants had to prove their case on the balance of probabilities  and
    the position had to be assessed at the date of  hearing,  Judge  Fowell
    set out his findings.  At paragraph 26 he found as follows:

         "26. Having regard to the medical evidence I have no difficulty  in
             accepting that [the  first  appellant]  did  indeed  suffer  a
             severe heart  attack  in  November  2017,  something  entirely
             unpredictable and out of the ordinary, and so this  is  not  a
             case of a couple coming to the UK  with  pre-existing  medical
             conditions in order  to  seek  treatment.   The  cost  of  the
             treatment required by [the first  appellant]  and  the  simple
             fact that it would have been much less costly in  India,  also
             strongly   support   that   view.    It   is   also   entirely
             understandable, given her dependence on her  husband  and  the
             existing symptoms of dementia, that this event  gave  rise  to
             severe anxiety on his wife's part, causing a  step  change  in
             her condition."

16. Judge Fowell then found [at  paragraph  27]  that  it  was  the  second
    appellant's condition which  was  now  a  concern,  because  the  first
    appellant was able to take his grandson to school and  back  each  day,
    which he enjoyed, and was also involved  in  the  local  Gurdwara.   He
    noted that the second appellant had "a range of health  conditions  the
    main concern [of which] is her dementia".  He  found  that  within  the
    son's household and with the help of her GP  and  local  Mental  Health
    Team she is now well provided for.

17. At paragraph 28, Judge Fowell found that treatment would  be  available
    in India and noted that evidence had not been adduced (the burden being
    on the  appellants)  to  show  that  it  would  not.   Also,  both  the
    appellants had "extensive family" in India and financial support  could
    continue from the UK.

18. Judge Fowell also accepted  (at  paragraph  29)  that  the  appellants'
    daughter-in-law had been suffering from anxiety and panic  attacks  and
    that the presence of the appellants had led to an  improvement  in  her
    mental health.

19. Judge Fowell's conclusions are set out from paragraph 30  onwards.   At
    paragraph 30 the first question the judge asked himself was whether the
    facts as he had found were "sufficient to meet the requirements of  the
    Immigration Rules".  He considered that "the test here is whether there
    are insurmountable obstacles to their family life continuing in India".
     At paragraph 31 he stated as follows:

         "31. Insurmountable obstacles is defined in the Rules as:

                  "... very significant difficulties which would be faced by
                  the applicant or a partner in continuing their family life
                  together outside the UK and which could not be overcome or
                  would entail very serious hardship for  the  applicant  or
                  their partner."

20. It is the appellants' case as set out in the  grounds  of  appeal  that
    this is not the appropriate test relevant to adult dependent  relatives
    who are  in  the  UK,  but  that  this  test  applies  only  where  the
    application is made for leave under "the partner or parent route  where
    either the financial requirement or immigration status cannot be  met".



21. In any event, Judge Fowell was quite satisfied that the  insurmountable
    obstacles test "cannot be met" because  "it  focuses  entirely  on  the
    relationship between the appellants, rather than between them and their
    son  and  his  family,  which  was  the  main  aspect  of  Ms  Bhachu's
    submissions".   He  considered  that   because   the   appellants   had
    "significant  family  connections  in  India"  and  their  former  home
    available to them "there is no real obstacle to their return".

22. Judge Fowell then considered that  the  Rules  "do  however  allow  for
    exceptional circumstances or  compelling  compassionate  factors  which
    make refusal unjustifiably harsh" but considered that in this case  the
    medical  psychiatric  report  had  emphasised  the  second  appellant's
    dependence on her husband (the first appellant) rather than her son  or
    daughter-in-law and noted that under the Rules "the test is not one  of
    reasonableness or suitability; it  requires  something  exceptional  or
    compelling, which is a very high threshold to meet".  The judge did not
    regard the "medical difficulties associated with increasing  years"  as
    in any way exceptional, and  considered  that  for  the  appellants  to
    "return together to a familiar environment in Punjab after a relatively
    short stay in the UK cannot be regarded as unjustifiably harsh".

23. Judge Fowell then considered the "broader balancing exercise" which  he
    believed was required under Article 8, on the  basis  as  explained  at
    paragraph 34 that:

         "No set of Rules can apply to  every  case  without  some  risk  of
         injustice, so, if the Rules are not met, the next stage is to carry
         out a broader balancing exercise required by Article 8, identifying
         all of the relevant circumstances and  weighing  them  against  the
         public interest."

    In this context, he set out what the Supreme Court had found in Agyarko
    v SSHD [2017] UKSC 11 in which at paragraph 57 the  Supreme  Court  had
    stated that "In general, in cases concerned  with  precarious,  a  very
    strong or compelling claim is required to outweigh the public  interest
    in immigration control".

24. At paragraph 35, Judge Fowell stated as follows:

         "35. There are some factors here which are not readily included  in
             the test set by the  Immigration  Rules.   Those  include  the
             family life between the appellants and their son, their  son's
             increased peace of mind and his wife's newfound  role  in  the
             house,  and  also  the  family  life  between   grandson   and
             grandparents.  (Given the extent  of  the  dependence  by  the
             appellants on the rest of the family I accept this amounts  to
             family life) [my  emphasis]  However,  it  is  instructive  to
             compare this arrangement with  the  test  required  for  adult
             dependent relatives.  If the  appellants  were  applying  from
             India, they would need to  show  that  as  a  result  of  age,
             illness or disability they required long-term personal care to
             perform everyday tasks, and that they were unable,  even  with
             the practical and financial help of their son, to  obtain  the
             required level of care in India, either  because  it  was  not
             available or was not affordable.  This is  a  very  much  more
             stringent test.  ..."

25. Judge Fowell then noted that the first appellant needed  to  do  little
    more than to take his medication  but  also  that  his  daughter-in-law
    wished to have her parents-in-law remain in order that  her  father-in-
    law could continue supporting her in taking care of  her  child.   This
    does not seem to have been developed further within the Decision.

26. At paragraph 36 Judge Fowell dealt with  the  position  of  the  second
    appellant as follows:

         "36. [The second appellant] clearly does require ongoing care,  but
             it follows that her husband would be in a position to  provide
             this, or at least there seems no reason why he could not do so
             in the first instance, supported  by  the  family  members  in
             India and if need be with financial support from the UK.  [The
             psychiatrist's] report does state that she carries a high risk
             of  self-neglect  and  disengaging  with  the  mental   health
             services without the full-time care and support of her husband
             and her daughter-in-law, together with  other  risks  such  as
             absconding from her home, but:

             (a)  she would have the care and support  of  her  husband  on
             return; and

             (b)  [The psychiatrist] is not in a position to give  evidence
             about the availability of  mental  health  services  or  other
             treatment in India."

27. Judge Fowell did not consider that the fact that the support which  the
    second appellant was currently receiving from her daughter-in-law would
    come to an end was a sufficient  reason  for  the  grant  of  leave  to
    remain.  He was also unimpressed with the argument which had been  made
    on behalf of the appellants that there  was  a  "cultural  expectation"
    that they would be looked after by their son and therefore  should  not
    be expected to rely on their daughters' assistance on return to  India.
    He noted that their son had made his life in the  UK  and  had  clearly
    done everything  he  could  for  his  parents  whilst  here,  including
    providing long term financial support, having them live in his home and
    also paying substantial sums in respect of the NHS debt his father  had
    incurred as well as all the legal costs  associated  with  this  claim.
    However, he considered that family support was available within  India,
    even if it was more normal,  or  the  cultural  expectation  was,  that
    support would be provided by the  son.   At  paragraph  38,  the  judge
    summed up his conclusion on this aspect of the claim as follows:

         "Whatever the usual cultural expectation, where  there  is  no  son
         available in India others may  have  to  do  more.   Again,  family
         support could continue from the UK, together with  the  possibility
         of visits to India."

28. Having found that there "Do not  ...  appear  to  be  any  sufficiently
    strong factors here, beyond those considered  under  the  Rules,  which
    would  lead  to  a  different  outcome"    Judge   Fowell   then   "for
    completeness" set out what is  provided  within  Section  117B  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 which provides as follows:

         "117B  Article 8: public interest considerations applicable in  all
         cases

         (1)  The maintenance of effective immigration  control  is  in  the
             public interest.

         (2)  It is in  the  public  interest,  and  in  particular  in  the
             interests of the economic well-being of  the  United  Kingdom,
             that persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom
             are able to speak  English,  because  persons  who  can  speak
             English-

             (a)  are less of a burden on taxpayers, and

             (b)  are better able to integrate into society.

         (3)  It is in  the  public  interest,  and  in  particular  in  the
             interests of the economic well-being of  the  United  Kingdom,
             that persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom
             are financially independent, because such persons-

             (a)  are not a burden on taxpayers, and

             (b)  are better able to integrate into society.

         (4)  Little weight should be given to-

             (a)  a private life, or

             (b)  a relationship formed with a qualifying partner,

             that is established by a person at a time when the  person  is
             in the United Kingdom unlawfully.

         (5)  Little weight should be given to a private life established by
             a person at a time when the  person's  immigration  status  is
             precarious."

29. Regarding sub-paragraph (1) Judge Fowell regarded  this  as  "simply  a
    statement" to the effect that maintenance of immigration control is  in
    the public interest, but had considered, at  paragraph  42,  that  "the
    more significant question is how much weight  attaches  to  the  public
    interest".  When answering this question, he considered the  answer  as
    follows:

         "The answer to that is  that  it  is  set  out  in  the  Rules  and
         Guidance.  So in a case like this  the  general  position  is  that
         establishing family life in the UK is not sufficient  unless  there
         would be insurmountable obstacles to continuing it abroad."

30. Judge Fowell noted that neither appellant had any particular ability in
    speaking English, but acknowledged that they would not  be  financially
    dependent on the state, because they would be supported by their son.

31. Regarding (4) and (5) at paragraph 45, Judge Fowell found as follows:

         "... given their age and the length of  their  marriage  it  cannot
         really be said that their family life  has  been  strengthened  and
         developed in the UK to any noticeable extent."

32. Having set out the facts and  his  interpretation  of  the  law,  Judge
    Fowell dismissed the appeal because he considered that  the  appellants
    could return together to India and would be able  to  cope  with  other
    family and medical support which he considered would have been the case
    had the first appellant suffered his heart attack whilst in India.

Submissions

33. I heard oral submissions on behalf of  both  parties.   Ms  Bhachu,  on
    behalf of the appellants, continued to rely  on  the  grounds  and  her
    skeleton argument.  Her primary submission was that the Rules  had  not
    been designed to  deal  with  situations  such  as  this,  where  adult
    dependent relatives had not come  to  the  UK  with  the  intention  of
    circumventing the Rules rather than applying from  outside,  but  whose
    circumstances had changed whilst they were here.   The  facts  in  this
    case were that they could not return when their leave  ended,  and  the
    judge had accepted this.  The distinction between  the  facts  in  this
    case and a case where a couple had come to this  country  intending  to
    circumvent the Rules was that Article 8 was engaged here, which did not
    just depend on what care was available in India.  A decision-maker  had
    to consider the family life which had been built up while they were  in
    this country; that included the family ties which  the  appellants  had
    with their son, daughter-in-law and grandson.

34. Where the judge had gone wrong was that in this case  this  couple  now
    had a family life beyond their family life with each  other  and  there
    were arguably compelling  and  compassionate  circumstances,  regarding
    their medical needs and so on which had arisen after they  had  arrived
    here.  The English language requirements (Ms Bhachu claimed)  were  not
    required under the Rules with regard to partner  applications,  and  so
    far as financial independence was concerned, third  party  support  was
    sufficient.   The  judge  had  accepted  that   the   appellants   were
    financially supported by their son.

35. The judge did not deal with the emotional impact of the appellants  not
    having their family with them, and had  not  taken  into  account  that
    there would be a family split, rather focussing  on  practical  support
    which might be available within India.  He also  had  not  factored  in
    that the appellants' daughters lived some four to five hours away.

36. On behalf of the respondent, Ms Everett submitted first of all that the
    judge had to be guided by consideration of adult dependency Rules,  and
    the fact that they could not was "inevitably going  to  attract  a  lot
    weight as a finding".

37. Ms Everett accepted that the judge had found that there was family life
    between the appellants and the family unit within the UK, but  asserted
    that the second appellant was largely dependent on her husband  and  as
    they could not meet the Rules and they  had  a  home  in  India  and  a
    cleaner and so on, as well as three daughters there, requiring them  to
    return to India would be a proportionate interference with their family
    life in this country.   While  she  did  have  some  sympathy  for  the
    argument advanced on behalf of the appellants, the judge had considered
    family life and proportionality and had come to a conclusion  that  was
    legally sustainable.

38. Regarding the help which might be provided by the appellants' daughters
    in India, while Ms  Everett  understood  the  point  about  this  being
    speculative, it was not enough for the appellants to rely on  "cultural
    expectations".   The  question  was  about   how   families   organised
    themselves and there was no evidence that the daughters would refuse to
    help their parents notwithstanding difficulties which might arise.

39. In reply, Ms Bhachu asked the Tribunal to  note  that  there  had  been
    evidence before the First-tier Tribunal regarding the daughters to  the
    effect that they would be unable to travel  everyday  to  assist  their
    parents.

40. The representatives then made submissions as to the application of  the
    Supreme Court decision in Agyarko v SSHD and Ikuga v SSHD  [2017]  UKSC
    11.  On behalf of the respondent, Ms Everett submitted that  the  judge
    had considered all the facts in this case, but that if this Tribunal is
    of the view that he had not, that might be sufficient to find an  error
    of  law.   On  behalf  of  the  appellants,  Ms  Bhachu,  referring  in
    particular to paragraph 60 of Agyarko  and  Ikuga  submitted  that  the
    judge had not factored into his conclusions the  blamelessness  of  the
    appellants and the extent to which the events since they had arrived in
    the UK had affected their family life, and had had impact on the  unity
    of the family unit as a whole.

41. I reserved my decision.

My conclusions

42. When granting permission to appeal,  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Gibb,
    setting out his reasons, stated as follows:

         "...

         2.   The grounds, ... complained that the judge erred in:

             (i)  using the "insurmountable obstacles" test as  a  starting
                  point to the Article 8  proportionality  assessment  where
                  this was not relevant to the position of elderly dependent
                  relatives; and

             (ii) not conducting the proportionality assessment in view  of
                  the fact that there was a gap in the Rules.

         3.    The  grounds  are  arguable.   On  the  second   ground   the
             appellants' representatives need to be prepared to show why it
             was an incorrect legal approach to  the  focus  on  the  entry
             clearance  test  for  elderly  dependent  relatives,  on   the
             hypothetical basis that that would be the test  applicable  if
             they had  applied  from  abroad  (see  [35])  of  the  judge's
             Decision.  The difficulty of the point advanced in the  second
             ground is that it could be said to put those  who  apply  when
             here as visitors in a better position than those who apply for
             entry clearance.  ..."

43. In my judgement, in a case where an applicant has come to the UK  as  a
    visitor with the ulterior purpose of making a claim to remain  in  this
    country rather than applying from abroad, this may well  be  a  weighty
    reason why permission should be refused.  That,  however,  is  not  the
    case here, as the judge clearly found.

44. I do not need to set out the various Decisions in which Article  8  has
    been considered over the years because for present purposes the law  is
    summarised within paragraph 60 of Agyarko and Ikuga, with reference  to
    paragraph 19, which sets out  the  relevant  Immigration  Instructions.
    Although Agyarko and Ikuga was concerned with the position of a partner
    whose application cannot be granted under the Rules, what  is  said  at
    paragraph 60 clearly has a general application.  I set  out  paragraphs
    19 and 60 of Agyarko and Ikuga:

         "19. The Instructions state that although refusal of an application
             will normally be appropriate where the applicant does not meet
             the requirements of the Rules, leave can  be  granted  outside
             the Rules where  exceptional  circumstances  apply.   In  that
             regard, the Instructions state:

                  "'Exceptional'  does  not  mean  'unusual'  or   'unique'.
                  Whilst all cases are to some extent unique,  those  unique
                  factors do not generally  render  them  exceptional.   For
                  example, a  case  is  not  exceptional  just  because  the
                  criteria set out in EX.1. of Appendix FM have been  missed
                  by  a  small   margin.    Instead,   'exceptional'   means
                  circumstances   in   which   refusal   would   result   in
                  unjustifiably harsh consequences for the  individual  such
                  that   refusal   of   the   application   would   not   be
                  proportionate.  That is likely to be the  case  only  very
                  rarely." (para 3.2.7d)

             In determining whether there  are  exceptional  circumstances,
             the decision maker is  instructed  to  consider  all  relevant
             factors.  Some examples are given:

                  "The circumstances around the applicant's entry to the  UK
                  and the proportion of the time they have been  in  the  UK
                  legally as opposed to  illegally.   Did  they  form  their
                  relationship with their partner at a time when they had no
                  immigration status or this was  precarious?   Family  life
                  which involves the applicant putting down roots in the  UK
                  in the full knowledge that their stay here is unlawful  or
                  precarious, should be given  less  weight,  when  balanced
                  against the factors weighing in favour  of  removal,  than
                  family life formed by a person  lawfully  present  in  the
                  UK."

         ...

         60.  It remains the position that the ultimate question  is  how  a
             fair balance should be struck between the competing public and
             individual  interests  involved,  applying  a  proportionality
             test.  The Rules and Instructions in issue in the present case
             do not depart from that position.  The Secretary of State  has
             not imposed a test of exceptionality, in the sense which  Lord
             Bingham had in mind: that is to say, a  requirement  that  the
             case should exhibit some  highly  unusual  feature,  over  and
             above the application of the test of proportionality.  On  the
             contrary, she has defined the word "exceptional",  as  already
             explained, as meaning "circumstances in  which  refusal  would
             result in unjustifiably harsh consequences for the  individual
             such  that  the  refusal  of  the  application  would  not  be
             proportionate".   So  understood,   the   provision   in   the
             Instructions that leave can be granted outside the Rules where
             exceptional circumstances apply involves  the  application  of
             the test  of  proportionality  to  the  circumstances  of  the
             individual case, and cannot be regarded as  incompatible  with
             Article 8.   That  conclusion  is  fortified  by  the  express
             statement in the Instructions that "exceptional" does not mean
             "unusual" or "unique": see para 19 above."

45. Although, as I indicated at the outset when referring to Judge Fowell's
    decision, it is detailed and careful, nonetheless I consider that it is
    not sustainable.  Although at paragraph 35 the judge found that  "given
    the extent of the dependence by the  appellants  on  the  rest  of  the
    family I accept that this amounts to family life",  that  finding  does
    not seem to have  been  factored  into  the  judge's  consideration  of
    whether or not that family life was such  that  the  interference  with
    that family life which would be caused by the removal of the appellants
    could be said to be proportionate.

46. Judge Fowell immediately after accepting that the relationship  between
    the appellants and his family in the UK amounted to family life went on
    to state that "However, it is instructive to compare  this  arrangement
    with the test required for adult dependent relatives".  With this  test
    in mind he considered that had they been applying from outside  the  UK
    they could not succeed under the Rules.

47. The judge, when considering the public  interest  considered  that  the
    effect of the Rules and Guidance was that "in  a  case  like  this  the
    general position is that establishing family life  in  the  UK  is  not
    sufficient unless there would be insurmountable obstacles to continuing
    it abroad"(paragraph 42).  He could only have had in mind  when  making
    this statement the family life  between  the  two  appellants,  because
    clearly the family life between the appellants and their family in  the
    UK  could  not  continue  if  the  appellants  return  to  India.   The
    appellants' son, daughter-in-law and grandson will remain in the UK and
    whatever modest comfort they may be  able  to  salvage  from  what  are
    euphemistically known as "modern means of communication" this is not in
    any meaningful  sense  a  continuation  of  family  life.   If  current
    lockdown conditions have taught us anything, (in my Judgement),  it  is
    that  so-called  family   life   experienced   through   these   modern
    communication methods are no substitute for the real thing.

48. The restricted way in which the  judge  treats  family  life  (that  is
    without regard to the family life which at paragraph 35 he had accepted
    existed between the appellants and his UK family) is also  apparent  in
    paragraph 45 where he stated that "given their age and  the  length  of
    their marriage it cannot really be said  their  family  life  has  been
    strengthened and developed in the UK to any  noticeable  extent"  (this
    was in regard to (4) and (5) of Section 117B of the 2002 Act).   It  is
    clear that the judge again can only have had in mind  the  relationship
    between the two appellants, because this does not consider  the  family
    life which the appellants have with their son who  they  had  not  seen
    since their previous visit to this country  and  their  daughter-in-law
    and their grandson who they had not seen before.  It does not have  any
    regard to the effect of their departure from  the  UK  on  the  son  or
    grandson or on their daughter-in-law, who has come  to  depend  on  her
    father-in-law.

49. The proportionality exercise which must be conducted by  all  decision-
    makers can only be conducted properly by reference to the  family  life
    which will actually be disrupted and interfered  with,  which  in  this
    case is that between the appellants and his  UK  family,  and  not  the
    family life between the two appellants, which obviously will  continue.



50. For this reason, I am satisfied that Judge Fowell's  decision  must  be
    set aside and re-made.

My Decision

51. Although when I reserved the Decision I had at that stage considered it
    likely that there would have to be a re-hearing, having  given  anxious
    scrutiny to all the facts and circumstances of this case, I do not  now
    believe that a re-hearing is necessary.  This is because I am  able  to
    make the Decision myself, in light of  the  judge's  factual  findings,
    which  are  not  to  any  meaningful  extent  challenged.   As  I  have
    indicated, the primary finding is that the judge was satisfied that the
    relationship  between  the  appellants  and  their  son,  grandson  and
    daughter-in-law amounted to family life.  I am quite satisfied, on  the
    facts of this case, that  this  family  life  goes  beyond  the  normal
    emotional ties to be expected between parents and their adult children.
     I have in mind also the judge's finding at paragraph 26 that "This  is
    not a case of a couple coming  to  the  UK  with  pre-existing  medical
    conditions in order to  seek  treatment".   As  the  judge  noted,  any
    treatment which the first appellant needed would have  been  much  less
    costly in India, and I agree with the judge's conclusion  that  on  the
    evidence it was certainly much more likely  than  not  that  the  rapid
    deterioration of the second appellant's  health  and  her  accelerating
    dementia was as a consequence of her husband's unexpected heart attack.



52. In this regard what is contained within the Instructions, as set out at
    paragraph 19 of Agyarko and Ikuga is particularly relevant, and applies
    equally to their position as it would in an application  for  leave  to
    remain by a partner.  They did not develop this relationship with their
    UK  family  from  choice;  their  very  sad  medical  history  was  not
    anticipated and  accordingly  the  fact  that  their  family  life  was
    established in this country  at  a  time  when  their  immigration  was
    precarious, is not a factor to which any substantial weight  should  be
    given.  I also note in  this  context  that  strictly  neither  Section
    117B(4) or (5) is applicable in this situation, because  this  Tribunal
    is not now considering a  private  life  formed  at  a  time  when  the
    appellants were in this country unlawfully or  when  their  immigration
    position was precarious, but their family life.  In this context,  what
    is important, as the  Supreme  Court  emphasised  at  paragraph  60  of
    Agyarko and Ikuga  is  to  strike  a  "fair  balance  ...  between  the
    competing  public  and  individual  interests  involved,   applying   a
    proportionality test".

53. In this case, having regard to what is set out at Section 117B  of  the
    2002 Act, which contain the public interest  considerations  applicable
    in all cases, I note, as the judge did, that the appellants will not be
    a financial burden on the state, because their son  at  great  personal
    expense has shouldered so far the burden of repaying the NHS  and  will
    also be looking after his parents financially  and  I  also  note  that
    their inability to speak English will be of less relevance than if they
    were younger, because they will not be a burden on  taxpayers  (because
    they will be supported by  their  son)  and  the  first  appellant,  in
    particular, is clearly integrating into society to some extent, because
    he is going to his local place of worship and also taking his  grandson
    to school.

54. I have in mind the definition  of  "exceptional"  set  out  within  the
    Instructions, as approved within the Supreme Court at paragraph  60  of
    Agyarko and Ikuga, and that this does not mean  "unusual"  or  "unique"
    but should be considered in light of the question as to whether or  not
    the consequences for the appellants will be sufficiently harsh that the
    refusal of the application would not be proportionate.

55. When I consider all the  factors,  I  am  satisfied  that  whereas  the
    disruption to the appellants' family life  in  this  country  by  their
    removal would be severe, the adverse consequences for society of  their
    remaining in this  country  would  in  reality  have  be  only  slight.
    Although,  as  a  general  statement  the  maintenance   of   effective
    immigration control is in the public interest, that does not require in
    wholly unanticipated circumstances such  as  this  that  an  inflexible
    approach be adopted.

56. The appellants will not be a financial  burden  on  this  country,  and
    their presence here will not and cannot be seen properly as a precedent
    whereby others would be encouraged to circumvent the Rules.  In  answer
    to the "difficulty" posited by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Gibb  when
    giving his reasons for allowing permission to appeal that "It could  be
    said to put those who apply when here as visitors in a better  position
    than those who apply for entry  clearance  [from  outside]"  I  do  not
    consider this to  be  so.   The  reason  the  appellants'  family  life
    developed in this country was because of circumstances  which  had  not
    been anticipated when they came to this country.  There is no reason to
    believe  that  but  for  the  very  sad  deterioration  in  the  second
    appellant's health, caused by the first appellant's very serious  heart
    attack, they would not have returned to India as  they  had  said  they
    would before they came.  This makes their case very different from  the
    sort of case which Judge Gibb had in mind.

57. In carrying out an independent assessment, on the basis of the facts as
    Judge Fowell had found them to be, I am quite satisfied that it is  not
    proportionate for the appellants' Article 8 rights to respect  for  the
    family life they currently enjoy with their family  in  England  to  be
    interfered with.  Their circumstances, while not  necessarily  "unique"
    are certainly (I would hope) "unusual", but even that is not  required.
    It would in my judgement be very harsh indeed,  and  unduly  harsh,  to
    require these appellants' family life which they now have with their UK
    family to be interfered with, and indeed stopped,  merely  because  had
    they now been  applying  from  outside  the  UK  they  could  not  have
    satisfied the dependent relative requirements.  Had they been  applying
    from outside the UK, they would not have built  up  their  family  life
    within this country to the  extent  to  which  they  have.   I  do  not
    consider it  necessary  to  leave  out  compassion  and  humanity  when
    considering proportionality; nor should I ignore the effect on the rest
    of the family in the UK, (including the  grandson,  whose  relationship
    with his grandfather who regularly takes him to school  is  a  valuable
    one), whose Article 8 rights also have to be taken  into  consideration
    (see Beoku-Betts [2008] UKHL 39).

58. I note in this regard that at paragraph 49,  Judge  Fowell  had  stated
    that "Overall, their desire to stay in the UK with their  son  and  his
    family is entirely understandable and I accept that it is beneficial to
    them and to the rest of the family group".  While, as the judge  stated
    (also at paragraph 49) it  might  be  "perfectly  manageable"  for  the
    appellants to return together to India and to cope together there,  and
    even though as the judge also found it "would no doubt  have  been  the
    case had [the first appellant] suffered his heart attack whilst there",
    I do not in all the circumstances of the case consider that it would be
    proportionate for the respondent to require them so to do.

59. It follows that this appeal must be allowed, and I so find.

Decision

I set aside the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Fowell  as  containing
a material error of law and re-make the  Decision  allowing  the  appeal  on
human rights grounds, Article 8.

No anonymity direction is made.
