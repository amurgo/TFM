For the Appellant:     Ms Faryl, Lei Dat and Baig Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Tan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. The Appellant is a national of Sudan born in 1994.  He  appeals  with
       permission the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  (Judge  O'Hanlon)
       to dismiss his protection appeal.

    2. For the purpose of this appeal the material finding of fact  made  by
       the First-tier Tribunal is that the Appellant  is  a  member  of  the
       Hausa, a non-Arab tribe.

    3. Having made that finding the First-tier Tribunal directed  itself  to
       the country guidance in AA (non-Arab Darfuris - Relocation) Sudan  CG
       [2009] UKAIT 00056 and MM  (Darfuris)  Sudan  CG  [2015]  UKUT  00010
       (IAC),  to  the  effect  that  "all  non-Arab  Darfuris  would   face
       persecution in Sudan on the basis of their ethnicity alone".   It  is
       implicit in the reasoning [at FTT ï¿½46]  that  applying  that  country
       guidance, the Appellant would win his appeal.

    4. The Tribunal was not however  satisfied  that  the  country  guidance
       continues to apply. It noted the  Respondent's  submission  that  the
       situation in Sudan has improved for non-Arab Darfuris and  found  the
       Respondent's Country Policy and  Information  Note  ('the  CPIN')  to
       constitute cogent evidence justifying departure from the guidance  in
       AA and MM.  On that basis the appeal was dismissed.

    5. I am satisfied that in so doing the First-tier Tribunal erred. Whilst
       Mr Tan did submit that Judge O'Hanlon would  have  been  entitled  to
       reach the decision that he did on the basis of  the  evidence  before
       him,  he accepts that Judge O'Hanlon erred in law in that  he  failed
       to have regard to any of the evidence presented, or submissions made,
       on the Appellant's behalf.  That being the case his  decision  cannot
       stand.

    6. It is now clear that the information in the CPIN is  not  capable  of
       displacing the extant country guidance, which should continue  to  be
       applied: AAR & AA (Non-Arab Darfuris  -  return)  Sudan  [2019]  UKUT
       00282 (IAC).

    7. I therefore set the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  aside  and
       substitute it by a decision allowing the appeal.




    Anonymity

    8. The Appellant is a refugee. As such I am satisfied, having had regard
       to the guidance in the Presidential  Guidance  Note  No  1  of  2013:
       Anonymity Orders, that it would be appropriate to make  an  order  in
       accordance with Rule 14 of the Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)
       Rules 2008 in the following terms:

           "Unless and until a tribunal or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
           Appellant is granted anonymity.  No report of these  proceedings
           shall directly or indirectly identify him or any member  of  his
           family.  This direction applies to,  amongst  others,  both  the
           Appellant and the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with  this
           direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"




       Decisions

    9. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contains material  error
       of law and it is set aside.

   10. The decision in the appeal is remade as follows:

           "the appeal is allowed on protection grounds".

   11. There is an order for anonymity.
