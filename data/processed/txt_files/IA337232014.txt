                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appeal

1.   This appeal is by the Secretary of State against the decision of First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Howard who in a  decision  promulgated  on  3  July
    2015, allowed Ms Xhika's appeal against the decision of  the  Secretary
    of State dated 11 August 2014 to  refuse  Ms  Xhika's  application  for
    Leave to Remain in the United Kingdom on the basis of her  family  life
    in the UK, as the spouse of a person present and  settled  in  the  UK.
    The First-tier Tribunal did not make an anonymity direction  and  there
    was nothing before the  panel  to  suggest  that  Ms  Xhika  should  be
    accorded anonymity for these proceedings.

2.   Although the applicant at this hearing is the Secretary of  State,  for
    the purposes of this decision I refer to the parties as  they  were  in
    the First-tier Tribunal.

Background

3.   The appellant is a citizen of Albania born on 10 September  1984.   The
    appellant entered the UK on 16 May 2013 with leave to remain  until  26
    July 2014 and made an application for leave to remain as the partner of
    Roland Rami on 17 June 2014.  The respondent  refused  the  appellant's
    application on 11 August 2014 as it was  concluded  that  the  evidence
    provided by the appellant failed to meet the requirements  of  Appendix
    FM-SE in order to demonstrate that the appellant's spouse's income  was
    at least �18,600 (it was stated that it was  �19,000).   The  appellant
    failed to provide was  slips  from  January  to  March  2014  and  bank
    statements for the same period as well as a letter from is employer  or
    a contract of employment and a P60.  It was  also  concluded  that  the
    appellant could not succeed under paragraph EX.1  or  paragraph  276ADE
    (1) of the  Immigration  Rules  and  that  there  were  no  exceptional
    circumstances.

4.   The appeal before Judge Howard  was  dismissed  under  the  Immigration
    Rules but allowed on human rights grounds.  In  summary,  Judge  Howard
    was satisfied that the requirements of  Appendix  FM-SE  were  not  met
    (either at the date of  the  decision  or  the  date  of  the  appeal).
    However in considering Article 8 outside of the Immigration  Rules  the
    judge was satisfied that removal would be disproportionate.

5.   The Secretary of State applied for permission to appeal on the  grounds
    that:

       . The judge had made a material misdirection in law by  allowing  the
         appeal under Article 8 but failing to  find  that  there  were  any
         exceptional circumstances or  insurmountable  obstacles  preventing
         the appellant and the sponsor pursuing family life elsewhere.

6.   Permission was granted on the basis that there was  an  arguable  error
    of law due to lack of reasoning in failing to identify  any  compelling
    or exceptional circumstances to warrant a grant of leave outside of the
    Rules and failing to properly consider Section 117B.

7.   The appeal came before me.

Error of Law

8.   Although the respondent  had  considered  the  appellant's  case  under
    Appendix FM:EX.1 and found that there were no insurmountable  obstacles
    to the appellant and her partner continuing their family  life  outside
    the UK, the judge does not allude to this in his findings.

9.   In SS (Congo) [2015] EWCA Civ 387 the Court  of  Appeal  restated  that
    compelling circumstances would have to apply  to  justify  a  grant  of
    leave to enter or leave to remain where the evidence Immigration  Rules
    (i.e. the rules in Appendix FM-SE of the Immigration  Rules  which  set
    out the form of evidence  required  to  substantiate  claims  that  the
    financial requirements of Appendix FM are met) are not complied with.

10.  Although the judge made findings that the requirements of Appendix  FM-
    SE were still not met at the date of hearing, and set out the rationale
    in MM and others [2014] EWCA Civ 985 that an 'arguable case that  there
    may be good grounds for granting leave to remain outside the rules'  he
    failed  to  make  any  finding  as  to  what  compelling  circumstances
    justified a grant of leave to remain outside of the Immigration Rules.

11.  I have reminded myself that whether the circumstances are described  as
    'compelling' or 'exceptional' is not a matter of substance and that 'in
    practice they are likely to be both  compelling  and  exceptional,  but
    this is not a legal requirement' (R (on the application of Sunassee)  v
    Upper Tribunal  (Immigration  and  Asylum  Chamber)  [2015]  EWHC  1604
    (Admin)).

12.  The judge identified no such circumstances and it cannot be  said  that
    the judge's reference to the sponsor only missing the  reference  to  a
    salary in the employer's letter, can be said to implicitly  (or  indeed
    explicitly) be such a circumstance.

13.  The judge also  failed  to  properly  direct  himself  in  relation  to
    Section 117 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum 2002 Act as  the
    judge found that the appellant's presence in  the  UK  has  never  been
    unlawful or precarious.  Whilst there was  no  evidence  before  me  to
    suggest that the appellant's leave has ever been unlawful,  it  is  not
    correct to say that  it  has  not  been  precarious.   Given  that  her
    presence here has always been dependent on a further grant of leave her
    presence here can only ever be  described  as  precarious;  AM  (s117B)
    Malawi [2015] UKUT 0260 (IAC) applied.

14.  I  was  satisfied  therefore  that  the  judge  materially  misdirected
    himself.

15.  I announced the conclusion during the  hearing  and  indicated  that  I
    would remake the decision.  I indicated that the  judge's  findings  in
    relation to Appendix FM-SE were preserved.

Remaking of the Decision

16.  The appellant's representative submitted  an  additional  bundle  which
    included further payslips.  I heard oral evidence  from  the  appellant
    and her husband who both gave evidence in English.  I heard submissions
    from both representatives.  At the end of the  hearing  I  reserved  my
    decision which I now give.

17.  Mr Tarlow conceded  that  nothing  was  disputed  in  relation  to  the
    factual evidence and that it was clear  that  the  sponsor,  a  British
    citizen originally from Kosovo has lived  in  the  UK  for  many  years
    (since 1998 when he was a minor)  and  has  been  in  employment.   The
    sponsor met the appellant whilst the sponsor was on holiday in  Albania
    and the sponsor visited the appellant a couple  of  times  in  Albania.
    The appellant moved to the UK to study and the couple do not  have  any
    children.  The appellant has a younger brother, a British  citizen  who
    lives in the UK with his family.  The sponsor originally came to the UK
    with his brother who also still lives in the UK.  Mr  Tarlow  submitted
    that although  the  couple  may  not  wish  to  go  to  Albania  it  is
    practically  possible  and  there  was  nothing  exceptional  in  their
    circumstances and no insurmountable obstacles to family life continuing
    outside the UK.

18.  Mr Malik emphasised that at the time of the application and the  appeal
    the couple were able to show that they met the financial  threshold  of
    �18,600 but that there were difficulties for his employer,  because  of
    the fluctuating nature of his income, in giving a  salary  figure.   Mr
    Malik emphasised that the sponsor was close to his brother in the UK as
    was the appellant to her brother here.  Although the appellant has  her
    mother in Albania at  the  moment  they  had  no  more  than  telephone
    contact. Mr  Malik  submitted  that  the  insurmountable  obstacles  in
    respect of Section EX.1 were that the relationships in the UK could not
    be maintained and that removal would have the unnatural result  of  the
    marriage ending.

19.  Appendix FM, section EX.1 provides as follows:

         'This paragraph applies if

         ...

         (b) the applicant has a genuine and subsisting relationship with  a
         partner who is in the UK and is a British Citizen, settled  in  the
         UK or in the UK with refugee leave or humanitarian protection,  and
         there are insurmountable obstacles to family life with that partner
         continuing outside the UK'

20.   The  respondent  considered  that  whilst  the   appellant   met   the
    suitability  and  eligibility  requirements  under  Appendix   FM   the
    respondent was not satisfied that it had been shown that there were any
    insurmountable obstacles to family life in the appellant's home country
    or elsewhere.

21.  Although I accept that neither the appellant nor the  sponsor  want  to
    live anywhere other than the UK, I am  not  satisfied  that  they  have
    demonstrated any insurmountable obstacles  to  family  life  elsewhere.
    Although I accept that the sponsor has never lived in Albania,  he  has
    visited on a number of occasions including when he met and visited  the
    appellant.  Although I accept that the sponsor is in employment in  the
    UK and relocation might be difficult given his established  life  here,
    he was unable to point to anything insurmountable in any  difficulties.
    The appellant has a mother in Albania and  there  was  no  evidence  to
    suggest that she would  not  be  able  to  assist  in  the  process  of
    resettling.  The appellant has experience of employment in the  UK,  as
    has the sponsor, skills which would assist them in  establishing  their
    family elsewhere  and  the  appellant  has  provided  evidence  of  her
    qualifications  to  Masters'  level,  again  which  would   assist   in
    resettling.

22.  I do not accept the sponsor's oral evidence that he would not  move  to
    Albania if he was required to do in order to maintain his  relationship
    with his wife.   It was also his  evidence  that  he  had  'never  ever
    thought of it' and it is difficult in this context to understand how he
    could  reach  such  a  potentially  far  reaching  decision  about  his
    relationship without prior consideration.  I do not accept that removal
    will result in the end of their marriage.  Although he clearly does not
    wish to and there may  be  practical  difficulties,  at  least  in  the
    beginning, that does not  equate  on  the  evidence  to  insurmountable
    obstacles to such a relocation.

23.  Mr Malik sought to rely on the relationships  that  the  appellant  and
    the sponsor have in the UK as amounting to 'insurmountable  obstacles'.
    Whilst I accept that both the appellant  and  the  sponsor  have  adult
    siblings in the UK and the appellant in particular may be close to  his
    brother given that they moved to  the  UK  together  as  refugees,  the
    siblings in question are all adults now living independently from  each
    other.   The sponsor indicated that his brother has  a  girlfriend  and
    that he sees him every week.  I am  not  satisfied  that  it  has  been
    demonstrated that either the appellant  or  the  sponsor  enjoy  family
    life, for the purposes of Article 8, with  their  respective  siblings.
    There must be more than normal emotional ties  in  these  circumstances
    for family life to exist for the purposes of Article 8(1) of the  ECHR:
    Kugathas [2003] EWCA Civ 31 applied.  Although I accept that there will
    still be emotional ties between the sponsor and his brother,  including
    as he indicated their parents were killed in Kosovo, I am not satisfied
    that their relationship now as adults goes beyond the  normal  ties  of
    siblings.

24.  I am therefore not satisfied that the appellant or  the  sponsor  enjoy
    family life in the UK other than with each other.  Although as  I  have
    noted they have private life ties here and relocation will  cause  some
    practical difficulties I am not satisfied that it has been  shown  that
    there is anything insurmountable in those difficulties.  Although again
    unwilling to consider making an application  for  entry  clearance  the
    appellant  and  the  sponsor  were  unable   to   point   to   anything
    insurmountable by way of an  obstacle  to  their  family  life  in  the
    appellant making such an  application.   Although  this  may  entail  a
    temporary separation, the sponsor  visited  the  appellant  in  Albania
    before and there was no adequate information to support the claim  that
    he could not do so  again.   There  was  no  evidence  to  support  the
    assertion that  this  would  mean  he  could  not  meet  the  financial
    requirements of the Immigration Rules.

25.  I have considered whether  a  second  stage  Article  8  assessment  is
    necessary outside of the Immigration Rules but I am satisfied  that  it
    is not as the matters relied upon by the appellant and her husband  are
    adequately covered by the provisions of the Immigration Rules.

26.  In so doing  I  have  applied  the  relevant  case  law  including  the
    guidance of the Court of Appeal in In SS (Congo) [2015] EWCA Civ 387:

         'The proper approach should  always  be  to  identify,  first,  the
         substantive content of the relevant Immigration Rules, both to  see
         if an applicant for LTR or LTE satisfies the conditions  laid  down
         in those Rules (so as to be entitled  to  LTR  or  LTE  within  the
         Rules) and to  assess  the  force  of  the  public  interest  given
         expression in those rules (which will be relevant to the  balancing
         exercise under Article 8, in deciding whether LTR or LTE should  be
         granted outside the substantive provisions set out in  the  Rules).
         Secondly, if an applicant does not satisfy the requirements in  the
         substantive part of the Rules, they may seek to  maintain  a  claim
         for grant of LTR or LTE outside the substantive provisions  of  the
         Rules, pursuant to Article 8. If there  is  a  reasonably  arguable
         case under Article 8 which has not already been sufficiently  dealt
         with by consideration of  the  application  under  the  substantive
         provisions of the Rules (cf Nagre, para. [30]), then in considering
         that case the individual interests  of  the  applicant  and  others
         whose Article 8 rights are in issue should be balanced against  the
         public interest, including as expressed in the Rules, in  order  to
         make an assessment whether refusal to grant LTR or LTE, as the case
         may be, is disproportionate and hence unlawful by virtue of section
         6(1) of the HRA read with Article 8.'

27.  The appellant was unable to point to a  reasonably  arguable  case  not
    sufficiently dealt with under the Immigration Rules including  Appendix
    FM EX.1.

28.  I have also  considered  the  guidance  from  the  House  of  Lords  in
    Chikwamba v SSHD [2008] UKHL 40  and  in  Hayat  (nature  of  Chikwamba
    principle) Pakistan  [2011]  UKUT  444  (IAC)  it  was  held  that  the
    significance of Chikwamba is to make it clear that in appeals where the
    only  matter  weighing  on  the  respondent's  side  of  an  Article 8
    proportionality  balance  is  the  public  policy   of   requiring   an
    application to be made under the Immigration Rules  from  abroad,  that
    the legitimate objective will usually be outweighed by factors  resting
    on the appellant's side of the balance.  However in my findings this is
    not a case where the only matter weighing on the respondent's  side  is
    the failure to make the application from outside  of  the  UK,  as  the
    appellant failed to satisfy the requisite Immigration Rules in relation
    to the financial requirements, specifically Appendix FM:SE.  I rely  on
    Judge Howard's findings that they still did not satisfy  FM:SE  at  the
    date of the appeal  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   There  was  no
    evidence before me to indicate that this has been rectified.

29.  Although it was argued that the nature  of  the  sponsor's  fluctuating
    employment meant his employer was unable to provide  an  annual  salary
    there was no adequate explanation for the continuing  failure  to  meet
    Appendix FM:SE.

30.  The approach to Article 8 in relation to Appendix FM-SE should  be  the
    same as under Appendix FM that compelling circumstances would  have  to
    apply; this is for two  reasons:  the  evidence  rules  have  the  same
    objective as the substantive rules and similar weight should  be  given
    to the respondent's assessment of what the public interest requires and
    secondly that enforcement of the  evidence  rules  minimises  arbitrary
    unfairness:  SS (Congo) applied.

31.  Although Mr Malik argued that weight should be given to the  fact  that
    the sponsor having shown that he had the requisite income to  meet  the
    financial requirements of Appendix FM  and  the  failure  to  meet  the
    documentary requirements was minor, being a  salary  requirement  on  a
    letter, that was in effect a near-miss argument.   It  is  settled  law
    that such an approach is not permissible in relation to Article 8.

32.  The case of Singh  v  SSHD  [2015]  EWCA  Civ  74  at  paragraph  66(2)
    provides:

         "If the decision-maker's view is  straightforwardly  that  all  the
         article 8 issues raised have  been  addressed  in  determining  the
         claim under the Rules, all that is necessary is, as Sales  J  says,
         to say so."

    I am satisfied that this is such a case.

33.   For  these  reasons  I  dismiss  the  appellant's  appeal  under   the
    Immigration Rules.

Notice of Decision

34.  The Judge of the First-tier Tribunal made  an  error  of  law  and  his
    decision to allow the appeal under Article 8 is set  aside.   I  remake
    the decision dismissing Ms Xhika's appeal under the Immigration Rules.
