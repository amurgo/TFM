                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


Introduction

 1. The Appellant born on 3rd January 1983 is a citizen of  Pakistan.   The
    Appellant had applied for entry clearance to the United Kingdom to join
    her spouse, the Sponsor, Mr Javed.  The  Respondent  had  refused  that
    application and the Appellant had appealed and the appeal was heard  by
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Fox on 6th  December  2013.   The  judge  had
    dismissed the appeal.

 2. Application for permission to appeal was made and that  permission  was
    firstly refused but granted by  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Coker  on  26th
    February 2014.  That was on the basis there appeared some inconsistency
    in the findings of the judge in respect of  the  marriage  certificate.
    It was also said  the  judge  may  have  failed  to  consider  relevant
    documents produced to him.

 3. The matter came  before  me  on  8th  April  2014  where  having  heard
    submissions and reserved my decision I found that an error of  law  had
    been made by the First-tier on the basis  of  matters  referred  to  in
    paragraph 10  of  that  decision.   Directions  were  issued  that  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal should be set aside and remade  and
    reserved to myself in the Upper Tribunal.

 4. The matter now comes before me  in  accordance  with  those  directions
    provided.

The Proceedings - Introduction

 5. I firstly identified the documents available in this case.

 6. The Respondent's documents consist of:

       . the full bundle provided by the Respondent  before  the  First-tier
         Tribunal.

 7. The Appellant's documents consist of:

       . those documents listed at pages 1 to 176 on the index sheet to  the
         bundle;

       . Sponsor's P45 provided at the hearing.

The Proceedings - Evidence

 8. As I had noted when hearing the error of  law  decision  there  were  a
    substantial number of documents in this case and the requirements under
    Appendix FM and Appendix FM-SE  are  not  without  complexity.   Having
    considered the documents and  referred  myself  to  the  error  of  law
    determination the issue in this case was the question of finance in the
    relevant period and the appropriate evidence in support of any  claimed
    finance.   The  Appellant  confirmed  October  2012  was  the  date  of
    application.  In respect of claimed employed income as a security guard
    he stated that he had begun that job on 3rd October 2007 and  left  the
    job in July 2012.  He had begun his self-employed work as a taxi driver
    on 25th May 2012.  He referred to page 147 of the Appellant's bundle in
    respect of his P60 for the period April 2011 to April  2012  indicating
    his employment salary as being �16,917.  Reference was made to page  78
    of the Appellant's  bundle  which  was  an  accountant's  letter  which
    indicated his self-employed income for the period May to  October  2012
    and had made reference to the addition of wages if any  which  provided
    an annual income said to  be  in  excess  of  �28,000.   There  was  an
    examination of bank statements within the Appellant's bundle  in  order
    to discover any income that might have been received from the  employed
    income.  There was available the P45 which had been absent  before  the
    First-tier  Tribunal.   That  P45  discloses  the  leaving   date   for
    employment as being 24th July 2012.  There were no entries in terms  of
    pay or tax contained within that document.

 9. There was no cross-examination and submissions consist of discussion on
    the documentary evidence with relation  to  the  specific  issues  that
    required to be considered in this case.  At the conclusion  I  reserved
    my decision to consider the documents and evidence and  I  now  provide
    that decision with my reasons.

Decision and Reasons

10. In this case the burden of proof lies on the Appellant and the standard
    of proof required for both immigration and human  rights  issues  is  a
    balance of probabilities.

11. The application in this case was made in October 2012.  The application
    was therefore made post the new Immigration Rules implemented from  9th
    July 2012.  The application therefore fell to be considered within  the
    terms of Appendix FM and the specified evidence required as outlined in
    Appendix FM-SE.  The Sponsor needed to demonstrate an income of �18,600
    to  meet  the  level  of  financial  requirements  applicable  to   his
    application under Appendix FM.

12. It became clear that in calculating his financial income the  Appellant
    had relied upon two separate sources of income in the  relevant  period
    namely employed income from his job as a security  guard  and  secondly
    self-employed income as a taxi driver.

13. What was not clear before the First-tier Tribunal Judge, because  there
    was an absence of the P45 or other evidence upon the subject,  was  the
    means by which the Appellant had calculated his employed income in  the
    relevant period.  The accountant's letter at page 78 had made reference
    to his wages as per the P60 for the year ending 5th April 2012 as being
    �16,917.48.  The Sponsor appears to have used for the  relevant  period
    May to October 2012 half of the annual income that he had received from
    employed income in the financial year April 2011 to April  2012.   That
    would have been a fair and proper  basis  for  calculating  his  earned
    income if he had remained in that employment at that  level  of  income
    during the relevant period.  However it transpired that the Sponsor had
    left his paid employment no later than July 2012 as  evidenced  by  the
    P45.  Accordingly in the relevant period May to October  2012  even  on
    the strength of the P45 for the majority of that period of time he  was
    no longer  in  paid  employment.   Indeed  on  an  examination  of  the
    Appellant's  Lloyds  TSB  Bank  statements  contained   with   in   the
    Appellant's bundle the last recorded payment  from  Corporate  Security
    for whom he previously worked was a payment on 9th March  2012  in  the
    sum of �416.40.  There is no record of any  receipts  postdating  March
    2012.  That final payment in the month of March is  substantially  less
    than payments he had received in previous months  which  while  varying
    somewhat averaged about �1,100 per month.

14. The conclusion I have reached therefore is that throughout the relevant
    period under consideration the Appellant received no income  from  paid
    employment as a security  guard  and  could  not  therefore  rely  upon
    earnings that he may have had previous to the relevant period  in  that
    capacity.  It is also the case in  any  event  that  in  terms  of  the
    provision of evidence  under  Appendix  FM-SE  the  Appellant  had  not
    provided a P60 for the relevant period, wage slips covering a period of
    six months prior to the date of application, a letter from the employer
    confirming those matters referred to in paragraph 2(d) of Appendix  FM-
    SE.

15. Therefore in terms of meeting the financial requirements the  Appellant
    could only rely upon self-employed income during the  relevant  period.
    The Appellant's evidence was that he had only begun as a  self-employed
    taxi driver in May 2012.

16. The application form completed in October 2012  by  the  Appellant  and
    Sponsor has claimed total income from  self-employment  in  the  twelve
    month period October 2011  to  October  2012  a  sum  of  �14,000.   As
    indicated above and confirmed within the accountant's letter and by the
    Appellant he only began  self-employment  in  May  2012.   The  claimed
    income from self-employment within the accountant's letter is a sum  of
    �11,680 inconsistent with that claimed  within  the  application  form.
    The accountant's letter at page 78 is supported by  accounts  at  pages
    158 to 166 of the Appellant's bundle.

17. In respect to the requirements under paragraph 7 of Appendix  FM-SE  in
    respect of the Appellant's self-employment there has been  no  evidence
    produced of the amount of tax payable or paid at any  stage.  Whilst  I
    accept such evidence may not be available within a  few  months  of  an
    individual beginning self-employment, the Appellant began in  May  2012
    and the date of this hearing is June 2014.  There has further  been  no
    up-to-date accounts produced by  the  accountants  on  the  Appellant's
    behalf that could have been prepared  to  demonstrate  the  Appellant's
    annual income from self-employment in the period April  2012  to  April
    2013.  The directions sent out with the error of law decision gave both
    parties liberty to file any additional documents not  contained  within
    the bundles before the First-tier Tribunal.  That  was  an  opportunity
    for the Appellant to  have  served  additional  documentation  to  have
    assisted his  case  in  terms  of  providing  evidence  required  under
    Appendix FM-SE.  There are further  so  far  as  I  can  see  no  self-
    assessment  tax  returns  covering  the  relevant  period   or   indeed
    thereafter.  There is in this case an absence of evidence  relating  to
    any tax paid or due which is a significant omission.   Given  the  time
    that has elapsed I would have  expected  such  evidence.   Further  the
    accountant's letter at page 78 which essentially is the whole basis for
    the Appellant's claimed self-employed income provides information  only
    for that six month period and is to that extent speculative as  to  the
    annual come.  Sufficient time  has  elapsed  that  would  have  allowed
    further accountant's reports to have provided  accurate  figures.   The
    absence of any information in that respect coupled with the absence  of
    any evidence of tax paid or payable leaves a not insubstantial question
    mark over the Appellant's  income  particularly  bearing  in  mind  the
    circumstances surrounding his  claimed  employed  income  as  described
    above.

18. In  terms  of  paragraph  7(g)  regarding  evidence  of  ongoing  self-
    employment  through  the  payment  of  class   2   national   insurance
    contributions the Sponsor  had  separately  handed  in  a  request  for
    national insurance contributions due dated 6th October  2012.   That  I
    believe had been available to the First-tier Tribunal Judge.  There had
    been no evidence of payments made although the Appellant did provide to
    me a Post Office receipt for 14th January 2013 in the  sum  due  and  I
    accept on balance that is in respect of the payment due no  later  than
    31st January 2013.  That is the only payment that  has  been  exhibited
    although clearly there would have been similar notices and payments due
    thereafter.  The absence of ongoing payments provides  no  evidence  of
    ongoing self-employment.

19. In summary therefore I find that in the relevant period  the  Appellant
    had no earned income from employment as a security  guard  despite  the
    completion of forms and assertions to the contrary.  In terms of income
    from self-employment as a taxi driver whilst there  is  the  basics  of
    such evidence for the period May to October 2012 it  does  not  provide
    for that which is required under paragraph 7 of  FM-SE.   I  have  also
    highlighted above the concern that despite  the  passage  of  time  and
    ability to file additional documents that would have provided  evidence
    of tax paid, up-to-date accountant's reports to demonstrate  an  annual
    income rather than speculation and evidence of ongoing  self-employment
    through the payment of national insurance contributions are all factors
    which are absent.  This is not  a  case  where  the  Appellant  in  the
    absence of such documentation can  turn  to  a  separate  self-employed
    business account or verifiable receipts as he maintains one account for
    all purposes and payments in cash.  That is not to say  those  features
    are not acceptable but where other required documentation is absent and
    there are additional concerns about  veracity  such  absence  does  not
    assist in answering questions.

20. I find therefore  that  the  Appellant  fails  to  meet  the  financial
    requirements in this case and the Sponsor has  failed  to  produce  the
    necessary evidence required under Appendix FM-SE.

21. For the avoidance of doubt I do not find there are any issues regarding
    the validity of this marriage.

22. I do not find that a refusal of  this  case  under  the  terms  of  the
    Immigration Rules leads to a disproportionate breach of Article  8.   I
    further  do  not  find  that  the  circumstances  in  this   case   are
    sufficiently compelling or that there are good reasons for  a  need  to
    examine this case outside of the Rules under Article  8  of  the  ECHR.
    The Appellant is entirely at liberty to make a fresh  application.   If
    the Sponsor is genuinely in self-employment as a  taxi  driver  earning
    above the required level then there has been a  sufficient  passage  of
    time for him to be able to  provide  all  the  financial  documentation
    required under Appendix FM and Appendix FM-SE and to  some  extent  the
    Sponsor is put on notice on the importance of providing the information
    in the required form.







Decision

23. I dismiss this appeal under the Immigration Rules and under  the  Human
    Rights Act.

    No anonymity order is made.
