DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

1. I have considered whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  an
   anonymity direction.  No  anonymity  direction  was  made  previously  in
   respect of this Appellant. Having considered all  the  circumstances  and
   evidence I do not consider it necessary to make an anonymity direction.

2. The Appellant was born on 3 February 1978 and is a national of Pakistan.

3. In order to avoid confusion, the parties are referred to as they were  in
   the First-tier Tribunal.

4. This is an appeal by the Appellant against  the  decision  of  First-tier
   Tribunal Judge M Davies promulgated on 1 November  2017  which  dismissed
   the Appellant's appeal against the decision of the  Respondent  dated  23
   July 2015 to refuse the Appellants application for refugee status.

5. Grounds of appeal  were  lodged  arguing  that  the  Judges  reasons  for
   adverse credibility findings were inadequately reasoned.

6. On 6 December 2017 First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Bird  gave  permission  to
   appeal.

7. At the hearing I heard submissions from Mr Thornhill  on  behalf  of  the
   Appellant that :

   a) The findings at paragraphs 84-86  that  led  the  Judge  to  find  her
      credibility  irreparably  damaged  were:  the  Appellants  immigration
      history, the fact that the Appellant had made an application for entry
      clearance in Abu  Dhabi  and  that  the  substantial  funds  that  the
      Appellant evidenced in her visa application was inconsistent with  her
      estrangement from her family.

   b)  In relation to her visa application this was not made in  Abu  Dhabi.
      Mr  McVitie  accepted  that  the  decision  was  made  there  not  the
      application.

   c) The only evidence in the visa application was that the  Appellant  had
      funds, there was no evidence as to the source of the funds  and  there
      was no evidential basis for the conclusion he reached.. The mater  was
      not raised at the hearing.

   d) The Judges consideration of the emails was flawed in  that  he  simply
      rejected them without any adequate explanation.

   e) It is accepted that the Judge looked at the  Appellants  case  in  the
      alternative but the reasons are so sparse that it is inadequate  given
      that if accepted her account was that they had tried living  elsewhere
      in Pakistan but had been found.

8. On behalf of the Respondent Mr McVitie submitted that:

   a) The Appellants account that her and her husband  had  been  living  in
      fear and in hiding since 2000. Her possession of �20,000 in funds  was
      inconsistent with that claim.

   b) The Judge gave all parties the opportunity to address the issues  that
      arose out of the production of the Visa application.

   c) In relation to the Judges consideration of the emails these cannot  be
      artificially separated from the other findings.

   d) In relation to internal relocation he accepted that this was not  very
      well reasoned but if the Appellants account was not credible this made
      no material difference

Finding on Material Error

9. Having  heard  those  submissions  I  reached  the  conclusion  that  the
   Tribunal made no material errors of law.

10. There is no challenge to the Judges findings at  paragraph  85  that  he
   found it of 'particular significance' that there was a 4  year  delay  in
   claiming asylum in that she arrived in the UK on 24 August 2011  claiming
   to be in fear of her family and in laws and yet did not make a claim  for
   asylum until 22 January 2015. This entitled the Judge to find  that  this
   reflected on the Appellants credibility.

11. There is no challenge to the finding made by the Judge at  paragraph  88
   that her claim that her father  was  strict  was  inconsistent  with  her
   history in that she had studied at University and worked as a teacher.

12. In  relation  to  the  adverse  conclusions  the  Judge  drew  from  the
   information contained within the visa application I am satisfied that the
   Judge gave adequate reasons for his conclusion and the Appellant had  the
   opportunity to address this evidence but chose not to do  so.  The  Judge
   sets out in detail at paragraphs 1-8 what happened after the hearing on 2
   August 2017. Having reserved his decision and  considered  the  evidence,
   issues arose which the Judge felt the parties should have the opportunity
   to address. There was therefore a hearing on 31 August 2017  where  there
   was no HOPO but Mr Thornhill was present. It was agreed  that  the  Judge
   would make directions 'relating to the evidence produced when application
   to enter the UK as a student.' Mr Thornhill was told that he  would  have
   the opportunity to consider  this  evidence  and  could  have  a  further
   hearing and  make  submissions.  On  12  September  2017  the  Respondent
   produced a copy of the Appellants 'Application  Details'  (not  the  visa
   application itself) and the evidence produced in relation to  it  was  no
   longer available. The notes in relation the application at page 2  stated
   that she produced a bank statement which showed  funds  of  �22,936.  The
   documents were served on the Appellants representatives. On 27  September
   2017 both parties were directed that they could  request  a  hearing  'to
   address issues that may arise  as  a  result  of  the  provision  by  the
   Respondent of a copy of  the  Appellants  visa  application.'  The  Judge
   directed that if there was no further hearing  or  submissions  he  would
   take into account the information contained within the  visa  application
   to satisfy the Respondent that she could satisfy the requirements of  the
   immigration rules. In a  letter  dated  2  October  2017  the  Appellants
   representative indicated that they did not require a further  hearing  or
   wish to make further representations. Therefore it is very clear that the
   Appellants representatives  were  given  a  number  of  opportunities  to
   address the issue of the evidence she produced to  show  that  she  could
   meet the requirements of the Rules contained within the document produced
   by the Respondent and that included evidence of funding. It was  open  to
   the Judge to find as he did at paragraph 86 that  that  the  amassing  of
   such a significant sum of money was inconsistent with her 'living in  the
   circumstances she claims in her evidence': this was that in essence  that
   her and her husband had lived in hiding from when they  married  to  when
   they fled from Pakistan with only her husband working and that  they  had
   moved to at least three different areas to live. It was also open to  him
   to conclude that such funds  appeared  to  suggest  that  they  were  not
   estranged from their respective families which  undermined  the  core  of
   their claim.

13.   The Judge was clearly  in  error  in  also  finding  that  it  was  of
   'particular significance'  that  the  Appellant  made  her  student  visa
   application at the overseas post in Abu  Dhabi  as  this  was  where  the
   decision was made not where the application was submitted.  However  this
   was only one of a number of adverse findings made by the Judge and  I  am
   therefore satisfied that this  error  could  not  have  made  a  material
   difference to the outcome.

14. Having found that the Appellant has fabricated her account it  was  open
   to him to reject the  emails  in  relation  to  which  Mr  Thornhill  had
   accepted in submissions there was no 'categorical proof' that  they  were
   sent by family members but they gave the  impression  of  being  genuine.
   Given the clearly acknowledged issues relating to  provenance  the  Judge
   was entitled at paragraph 89 to assess these together  with  the  adverse
   credibility findings he had made and conclude that he attached no  weight
   to them.

15. Given that I am satisfied that  the  Judge  gave  adequate  reasons  for
   finding that he rejected the Appellants core account  that  her  and  her
   husband had received threats from both families as a result of which they
   had to flee their home area any failings in the Judges assessment of  the
   adequacy of protection afforded by the state were  not  material  to  the
   outcome of the decision.

16. It is a trite observation that a judge need not address in detail  every
   single argument advanced before him,  nor  consider  in  isolation  every
   single piece of evidence. I was  therefore  satisfied  that  the  Judge's
   determination when read as a whole set out findings that were sustainable
   and sufficiently detailed and the Appellant cannot be in any doubt  about
   why the appeal was allowed: he did not find her a credible witness as  to
   her core account.

CONCLUSION

17. I therefore found that no errors of law have been established  and  that
   the Judge's determination should stand.

DECISION

18. The appeal is dismissed.
