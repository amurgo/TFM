Representation:
For the appellant:     Mr S. Karim, instructed by Liberty Legal Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr T. Melvin, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant appealed the respondent's decision dated 10 July 2019  to
    refuse a human rights claim.

2.   The appellant entered the UK on 29 November 2009 with  entry  clearance
    as a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant that  was  valid  until  31  July
    2012. He was granted an extension  of  leave  to  remain  in  the  same
    category until 31 July 2014. However, on 12 December 2012 he applied to
    vary his leave to remain to that of a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant. It
    is said that he withdrew the application on 29 May 2013. On 15 February
    2014 a decision was made to curtail his existing  leave  as  a  Tier  4
    migrant so that it expired on 18  April  2014.  The  decision  did  not
    attract a right of appeal.

3.   The appellant made an in-time application for further leave  to  remain
    as a Tier 4 migrant on 31 March 2014, which was refused with a right of
    appeal. While the appeal was pending, he  was  served  with  an  IS151A
    notice of liability to removal and IS151A Part 2 notice of  a  decision
    to remove on 30 September 2014. The notice of removal was  served  just
    before the changes to section 10 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999
    made by the Immigration Act 2014 came into force i.e. it  was  an  'old
    style' section 10 decision  attracting  an  out  of  country  right  of
    appeal. Although there does not appear to be a  copy  of  the  decision
    contained in the evidence before the Upper Tribunal a letter  from  the
    appellant's solicitors to the respondent dated 23 April 2019  indicates
    that the decision was likely  to  have  been  made  with  reference  to
    section 10(1)(b) (leave obtained by deception) on the  ground  that  it
    was asserted that the appellant produced a TOEIC certificate in support
    of a previous application which had been obtained by the fraudulent use
    of a proxy test taker.

4.   The appellant applied to revoke the section 10 decision on  09  October
    2014 and served a pre-action protocol letter on 19 November 2014. On 09
    December 2014 his appeal against the decision to refuse leave to remain
    as a Tier 4 migrant was dismissed. A renewed application for permission
    to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was refused on  22  May  2015  and  the
    appellant's appeal rights became exhausted. The appellant  remained  in
    the UK without leave from this point onwards.

5.   In the meantime, the appellant had filed an  application  for  judicial
    review of the section 10 removal decision on 29 December  2014.  It  is
    unclear from the respondent's summary of  the  appellant's  immigration
    history what happened in the judicial review proceedings.  The  summary
    merely describes the application being 'closed  by  the  court'  on  26
    November 2015.

6.   The appellant made a further application  for  leave  to  remain,  this
    time as a Tier 2 (General) Migrant, on 17 June 2015. This  was  refused
    and an Administrative Review  upheld  the  decision.  The  respondent's
    chronology indicates that  a  further  judicial  review  was  filed  to
    challenge these  decisions,  which  was  refused.  While  renewing  the
    application for permission to  bring  judicial  review  proceedings  it
    seems that the claim was settled. The respondent invited the  appellant
    to complete a Statement of Additional grounds under section 120 of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  On  23  April  2019  the
    appellant  made  further  submissions  on  human  rights  grounds.  The
    respondent refused the human rights claim in a decision dated  10  July
    2019, which is the decision that is the subject of this appeal.

7.   First-tier Tribunal Judge R. Cooper ('the judge') dismissed the  appeal
    in a decision promulgated on 04 March 2020. The judge set out the issue
    for determination in the appeal, summarising at  [21]  that  the  legal
    burden of proof was on the respondent to show that  the  appellant  had
    been dishonest. She made clear that the initial evidential  burden  was
    on the respondent to show that the appellant used  fraud  to  obtain  a
    TOEIC certificate. The evidential burden then shifted to the  appellant
    to provide an innocent explanation. She noted that if he  was  able  to
    provide one, then the burden shifted back to the respondent to show why
    the explanation should be rejected. She cited  the  decision  in  SM  &
    Qadir (ETS - evidence - burden of proof) [2016]  UKUT  229.  The  judge
    went on to summarise the evidence and  submissions  before  making  her
    findings [24-34]. She began by considering the allegation of fraud  and
    made her findings in the same order  in  which  she  had  set  out  the
    relevant  legal  framework.  She  began  by  considering  the  evidence
    produced by the respondent about high  levels  of  fraud  at  Elizabeth
    College (which issued the TOEIC certificate) in general but also on the
    day that the  appellant  claimed  to  take  the  test  [36-41].  Having
    concluded that the evidence met the initial evidential burden she moved
    on to consider the appellant's explanation  in  response  [42-62].  She
    made clear that she understood that that the  account  only  needed  to
    satisfy a 'minimum level of plausibility' [42]. Having  considered  all
    the evidence in the round she did not accept the  appellant's  response
    met that minimum level of plausibility [62] and concluded at [63]  that
    the respondent  had  discharged  the  overall  burden  of  proving  the
    allegation of dishonesty.

8.   The judge went on to determine the human rights  claim.  She  concluded
    that she did not go on to consider the rest of the requirements of  the
    immigration rules under paragraph 276ADE if the appellant did not  meet
    the 'Suitability' requirement. She conducted a balancing exercise  with
    reference to the five-stage approach in Razgar v SSHD  [2004]  UKHL  27
    and took into account the public interest  considerations  outlined  in
    section 117B NIAA 2002. Having weighed the factors  in  favour  of  the
    appellant with  the  factors  relating  to  the  public  interest,  she
    concluded  that  the  appellant's  removal  would  not  amount   to   a
    disproportionate breach of his right to private life under Article 8 of
    the European Convention.

9.   The appellant's grounds of appeal to the Upper Tribunal  only  seek  to
    appeal the judge's findings relating to the  allegation  of  dishonesty
    and do not seek to challenge the substantive findings relating  to  the
    underlying human rights claim. The appellant  appealed  the  First-tier
    Tribunal decision on the following grounds:

      i) The judge applied the wrong standard of proof because at  [61]  she
         said: 'On balance, I infer from the Appellant's failure  to  obtain
         the recording that he knew the voice on the recording would not  be
         his/ I have given this significant weight in my assessment  of  the
         evidence as a whole.' The judge should only have considered whether
         the  appellant's   explanation   reached   a   minimum   level   of
         plausibility. At [38] she also referred to the civil standard.

     ii) Failure to address the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) report.

    iii)  The  judge  unduly  speculated  about  the  appellant's  potential
         motivations for cheating and did not put several  points  that  she
         relied on in her  decision  to  the  appellant  to  answer  at  the
         hearing.

     iv) The fourth ground sets out a series of disagreements  with  various
         findings made by the First-tier Tribunal and asserts that the judge
         failed to make findings relating to relevant considerations.

      v) The last ground asserted that the  decision  was  promulgated  more
         than three months after the hearing and therefore could not stand.

10.  Due to the continued need to take precautions to prevent the spread  of
    Covid 19 the hearing took place in a court room at Field House with the
    legal representatives  appearing  by  video  conference  and  with  the
    facility for others to attend remotely. I was satisfied that  this  was
    consistent with the open justice principle, that the parties could make
    their submissions clearly, and that the case could be heard  fairly  by
    this mode of hearing. There was no objection to the case proceeding  by
    this mode of hearing.

Decision and reasons

11.  Having considered the grounds of appeal and the oral  submissions  made
    by the parties at the hearing I conclude that the  First-tier  Tribunal
    decision did not involve the making of an error of law.

Ground 1 - burden and standard of proof

12.  The judge clearly had in mind  the  relevant  burden  and  standard  of
    proof throughout the decision. She set out the issues for determination
    in the appeal, and at [21], made clear that  she  understood  that  the
    burden was on the respondent to show that it was more likely  than  not
    that the appellant had been dishonest. The judge made  clear  that  the
    respondent bore the initial evidential burden. If that  was  made  out,
    the burden then shifted  to  the  appellant  'to  provide  an  innocent
    explanation'. If he was able to, then the overall burden  shifted  back
    to the respondent to show on the  balance  of  probabilities  that  the
    appellant was dishonest. The judge cited the relevant decision in SM  &
    Qadir (ETS - evidence - burden of proof) [2016]  UKUT  229.  The  judge
    repeated the test  at  [36]  when  she  began  her  assessment  of  the
    evidence. She referred to the shifting burden  on  the  appellant  'who
    must provide a plausible innocent explanation'. She reiterated that the
    overall legal burden of proof was on the respondent.

13.  The judge then considered the evidence in  a  logical  order,  starting
    with the evidence produced by the respondent, which included  'look  up
    tool' information relating to the cancellation of the appellant's  test
    as well as information about the number of other tests  from  Elizabeth
    College cancelled on that day. She also had regard to a Project  Fa�ade
    report, which indicated the Elizabeth College was  on  of  21  colleges
    subject to criminal investigation due to  'high  test  volumes,  audits
    indicating  cheating  and  other  intelligence  and  information   that
    indicated widespread abuse of the exam' [39].

14.  The judge summarised the  account  given  by  the  appellant  [40].  He
    denied using a proxy test taker and  claimed  that  he  took  the  exam
    himself on 20th and 22nd March 2012. He said that he needed an  English
    language certificate to apply to extend his leave to remain, which  was
    due to expire on 31 July 2012. He said that he  applied  for  an  IELTS
    course, but could not get a 'near date'. Although he lived in  Plaistow
    he chose to do the TOEIC test a Elizabeth College because it  was  near
    where he worked in Kennington. He outlined how he travelled to the test
    centre and described the process of taking the test.

15.  The judge noted that the appellant's representative accepted  that  the
    evidence produced by the respondent met the initial  evidential  burden
    [41]. This was consistent with a number of cases, which  had  concluded
    that the 'generic evidence'  produced  in  such  cases  was  likely  to
    discharge the initial burden. At [42] the judge went on to state:

         '42. The evidential burden therefore shifts  to  the  Appellant  to
             raise  an  innocent  explanation,  namely  an  account   which
             satisfies the minimum level of plausibility  set  against  the
             backdrop  of  the  evidence  of  fraud  being  perpetuated  at
             Elizabeth College. In determining whether he  has  provided  a
             credible and plausible innocent explanation, I  have  assessed
             the reliability of the Appellant's evidence itself as well  as
             considering what he had to gain from cheating, what he had  to
             lose, whether it was unnecessary or illogical for him to  have
             cheated, his character, the cultural environment in  which  he
             operated, how he performed under cross-examination and whether
             his proficiency in English matched his TOEIC proficiency score
             (following SM & Qadir).'

16.  In considering whether  the  appellant  had  provided  a  credible  and
    plausible explanation in response to the respondent's  allegation,  the
    judge went on to consider a range of evidence that went  both  for  and
    against the  appellant.  She  made  detailed  findings  with  extensive
    reference to the evidence. After  having  considered  what  impact  the
    appellant's failure to obtain the voice recording  might  have  on  her
    decision, and having recognised that even if he had obtained it, and it
    did not include his voice, 'that would not  necessarily  be  conclusive
    proof of deception', she concluded:

         '61. ... However, when looking at the circumstances and evidence in
             this case in the round  I  find  the  Appellant's  failure  to
             request the voice recording from ETS  undermines  his  account
             and the innocence of his explanation,  when  set  against  the
             evidence of cheating at Elizabeth College. On balance, I infer
             from the Appellant's failure to obtain the recording  that  he
             knew the voice on the recording would not be his. I have given
             this significant weight in my assessment of the evidence as  a
             whole.

         62.  When looking at all of these matters in the round  and  having
             applied a balance sheet approach (weighing  up  those  matters
             falling  in  his  favour   against   those   undermining   the
             plausibility of his account) I  have  reached  the  conclusion
             that the Appellant has not provided  an  innocent  explanation
             that meets a minimum level of plausibility that he  personally
             took the TOEIC test at Elizabeth College in 2012.

         63.  For that reason I find the Respondent's grounds  for  refusing
             his  human  rights  application  on  the  grounds   that   the
             suitability requirements were not met (S-S-LTR.1.6)  are  made
             out. ...'

17.  Mr Karim submitted that it mattered  not  if  the  judge  set  out  the
    correct burden and standard of proof if, as a matter of fact,  she  did
    not apply it. He submitted that the wording used by the judge in  those
    final paragraphs indicated that she applied a balance of  probabilities
    test rather than assessing  whether  the  appellant's  evidence  met  a
    minimum level of plausibility. Whilst I accept that a judge  could  err
    in practice despite a correct exposition of  the  relevant  burden  and
    standard of proof, I do not accept that it happened in this  case.  The
    judge repeatedly  set  out  the  correct  legal  framework  and  having
    conducted a careful analysis of the evidence that  went  both  for  and
    against the credibility  of  the  appellant's  explanation,  came  full
    circle to the correct test of 'an innocent  explanation  that  meets  a
    minimum level of plausibility' [62]. Her reference to having considered
    matters 'on balance' in [61] and to a 'balance  sheet  approach',  when
    placed in the context of the totality  of  her  findings,  were  merely
    descriptors of the process of weighing the evidence and did not purport
    to have any legal meaning in relation to  the  burden  or  standard  of
    proof. It was open to the  judge  to  assess  the  credibility  of  the
    appellant's explanation in the context of  the  respondent's  evidence,
    which showed widespread fraud at Elizabeth  College  at  the  time  the
    appellant claimed to  have  taken  the  test.  Having  found  that  the
    appellant had failed to provide an  innocent  explanation  that  met  a
    minimum level of plausibility, she concluded that  the  respondent  had
    discharged the overall legal burden of proof [63].

Ground 2 - APPG report

18.  Although Mr Karim did not formally withdraw the second ground,  he  did
    not pursue it orally at the hearing. He did not explain why, but it  is
    likely that the second ground  was  not  argued  following  the  recent
    findings made by  the  Upper  Tribunal  in  DK  and  RK  (Parliamentary
    privilege; evidence) [2021] UKUT 00061 (IAC). In any event, the  ground
    makes general assertions about the observations made by the APPG  about
    the reliability of the 'look up tools' and  the  chain  of  custody  of
    evidence without particularising how or why this  evidence  would  have
    made  a  material  difference  to  the  outcome  of   the   appeal   in
    circumstances where it had apparently been conceded on  behalf  of  the
    appellant that the body of specific and generic  evidence  produced  by
    the respondent did at least meet the initial evidential burden of proof
    [29].

Grounds  3  &  4  -  procedural  unfairness,  failure  to  make  findings  &
    'erroneous' findings

19.  The third and fourth grounds  make  several  points  arguing  that  the
    judge speculated and made findings without giving the appellant a  fair
    opportunity to answer. The grounds  go  on  to  set  out  a  series  of
    disagreements with the findings made by the First-tier Tribunal and  to
    argue that other matters were not given sufficient consideration.

20.  The judge noted that the appellant 'was not robustly cross-examined  as
    regards his witness statement'  and  found  his  oral  evidence  to  be
    broadly consistent with the contents of his statement [45]. However, it
    is clear that the  respondent  had  not  withdrawn  the  allegation  of
    deception and that question of whether the appellant genuinely sat  the
    test was at the heart of the appeal.  It  was  open  to  the  judge  to
    consider whether the appellant's  account  met  the  minimum  level  of
    plausibility in light of all the evidence, including  the  evidence  of
    widespread fraud at Elizabeth College during the period when he claimed
    to take the test. The mere  fact  that  he  was  not  'robustly  cross-
    examined' does not lead to the inevitable conclusion that his  evidence
    was or should be accepted. It is clear that the Home Office  Presenting
    Officer submitted that weight  should  be  given  to  the  evidence  of
    widespread fraud and argued that  the  appellant  had  not  provided  a
    plausible explanation in response beyond a bare  denial  that  a  proxy
    test taker was used to obtained the required test score [32].

21.  The judge considered the plausibility of  the  appellant's  explanation
    and noted points that went for and against  him.  She  found  that  the
    explanation as to why he chose to do the test at Elizabeth College  was
    plausible. Although it was some distance from his home in Plaistow, the
    college was close to the place he claimed to work  in  Kennington.  The
    judge noted that an inconsistency in his  evidence  as  to  whether  he
    attended the test straight from home or from work was put to him at the
    hearing. It was open to her to note that the appellant did not  produce
    any evidence from the college to show that he booked the test.  It  was
    also open to her to note that the mere fact that the appellant was able
    to provide a description of the test was not  necessarily  evidence  to
    show that he did not use a proxy test taker. It was open to her to find
    that such information was readily available in the public  domain,  and
    indeed, appeared  to  be  contained  in  information  provided  in  the
    appellant's bundle [48]. The judge took into  account  the  appellant's
    description of the test and gave adequate reasons for her findings.

22.  The judge went on to consider other  evidence  that  might  go  to  the
    plausibility  of  the  appellant's  explanation.  She  considered   the
    appellant's English language ability. Whilst not purporting  to  be  an
    expert, the judge noted her observations about the appellant's level of
    communication at the hearing, including  misunderstandings  in  English
    with reference to direct quotes [51]. The judge  also  noted  that  his
    'stilted spoken English' was also reflected in his  witness  statement.
    She concluded that the appellant spoke 'reasonable English' during  the
    hearing, but it was open to her to note that this did  not  necessarily
    reflect what his level of English might have been when he took the test
    in 2012, some seven years earlier [53]. The judge went on  to  consider
    the evidence produced by the  appellant  of  earlier  English  language
    ability  including  English  language  certificates   and   educational
    certificates from the UK, which post-dated the test. She accepted  that
    the evidence showed that the appellant might not have had a  motive  to
    cheat solely on account of a lack of English language ability [55].  In
    light of that finding it is difficult to see how her failure to mention
    educational certificates from Bangladesh could have made  any  material
    difference to the outcome of the appeal.

23.  However, in light of the decision in MA (ETS -  TOEIC  testing)  [2016]
    UKUT 00450 (IAC) it was open to  the  judge  to  consider  whether  the
    evidence disclosed any other potential motives  for  the  appellant  to
    cheat even if he spoke a reasonable level of English  [56].  She  noted
    that there was no evidence to suggest that the appellant had  taken  an
    English language test before coming to the UK and  found  that  it  was
    reasonable to infer that he may have been unfamiliar with the  process.
    She  observed  that  there  was  little  evidence   relating   to   his
    circumstances during those early years in the UK to show whether he had
    made progress on the course  he  followed.  She  also  noted  that  the
    appellant appeared to be under pressure to get a 'short  booking  date'
    for the test and had been unable to get a 'near  date'  for  the  IELTS
    test.

24.  Mr Karim argues  that  these  matters  should  have  been  put  to  the
    appellant to answer at the hearing, but nothing has  been  produced  to
    show how he might have responded in order to  demonstrate  whether  his
    answers would have made any material difference to the outcome  of  the
    appeal. It is clear that inconsistencies were put to the  appellant  to
    answer. It is not incumbent for every issue considered in a decision to
    have been put to an appellant. The judge was  conducting  the  task  of
    evaluating the evidence and was entitled to draw conclusions  from  the
    evidence or lack thereof. The mere fact that he was likely to  be  able
    to  speak  reasonable  English  did  not  necessarily   discharge   the
    evidential burden on the appellant in light of the compelling  evidence
    showing, as it was described in  Ahsan & Others v SSHD [2017] EWCA  Civ
    2009, that Elizabeth College was an  'established  fraud  factory'.  In
    assessing  the  plausibility  of  the  appellant's  response   to   the
    allegation of deception it was open to the judge  to  consider  whether
    the appellant may have had other motivations to use a proxy test  taker
    in order to obtain a test certificate in  time  to  support  a  further
    application for leave to remain. For these reasons, I conclude that the
    First-tier Tribunal decision did not involve an error  of  law  on  the
    ground of undue speculation and was not procedurally unfair.

25.  At the hearing before the Upper Tribunal a point was made  in  relation
    to the judge's findings at [60]-[61] regarding what inference could  be
    drawn from the appellant's failure to obtain the voice  recording  from
    ETS. I note that this point was not pleaded in the grounds.  Mr  Karim,
    who was the author of the  original  grounds,  argued  that  the  judge
    failed to take into account relevant evidence, which  showed  that  the
    voice recording had been requested by the appellant in an email to  ETS
    sent on 28 February 2018 in which he requested a list  of  information,
    and at the end, also asked 'to  send  me  the  voice  recording  of  my
    speaking test'. Setting aside the fact that the point was not argued in
    the grounds, nor permission granted to rely on it, it is clear that the
    judge cited this email at the beginning of [60].  The  point  that  she
    went on to make was that the appellant made no further effort to obtain
    the voice recording following the ETS response to his  email  dated  15
    March 2018. In that letter ETS said:

         'In view of the number of  requests  that  have  been  received  to
         provide voice recordings, we have agreed a protocol with  the  Home
         Office regarding such matters. If you agree that  voice  recordings
         should be provided then ETS Global will provide copies of the same.
         Once we receive such confirmation  we  will  provide  the  relevant
         voice recordings to you and the Home Office.'

26.  The judge noted that this was put to the appellant  to  answer  at  the
    hearing. It was open to the judge to reject his explanation for failing
    to obtain the voice recording on the ground that he  misunderstood  the
    letter to mean that the Home Office needed to make the request. It  was
    open to the judge to note that he had legal representation at the  time
    and that he could have sought advice. Consequently, it was not  outside
    a range of reasonable responses  to  the  evidence  for  the  judge  to
    conclude that an inference could be drawn from the appellant's  failure
    to obtain the voice recording  [61].  For  these  reasons,  nothing  in
    grounds 3 or 4 disclose any material errors of law  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal decision.

Ground 5 - delay

27.  Rightly, Mr Karim did not pursue the fifth ground. The ground  asserted
    that the decision was  unsafe  because  the  appeal  was  heard  on  28
    November 2019, but the decision was  not  promulgated  until  04  March
    2020. Even if the ground was taken at its  highest,  it  cited  various
    cases without identifying how or  why  the  alleged  delay  might  have
    rendered the First-tier Tribunal decision unsafe. There was nothing  on
    the face of the decision to suggest that the delay might have  affected
    the judge's memory of the evidence or the reliability of her  findings.
    Indeed, the decision  made  detailed  reference  to  the  evidence  and
    included direct quotes from the appellant's oral  evidence.  The  fifth
    ground is swiftly disposed of by noting that it was based on a  mistake
    of fact. It is clear from the face  of  the  decision  that  the  judge
    completed and signed it on 05 February 2020 (within  10  weeks  of  the
    hearing) and that the delay was in the promulgation of the decision  by
    the court administration.

28.  For the reasons given above I conclude  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    decision did not involve the making of an error of law.
