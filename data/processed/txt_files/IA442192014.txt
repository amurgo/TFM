                                 JABIR AHMED
                                                                   Appellant

                                     and


                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent

                          NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL AND
                   REASONS FOR THE TRIBUNAL GIVING CONSENT

 1. By way of a letter dated 3 December 2015  the  appellant  has  requested
    that his case be treated as withdrawn by the Upper Tribunal.

 2. Consent of the Upper Tribunal is required for a party  to  withdraw  its
    case. Having carefully considered the facts of this appeal as  a  whole,
    and observing that the appellant was the  successful  party  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal, that decision has now been set aside.  The  request
    to withdraw the appeal is, in effect, an admission by the appellant that
    his appeal has no merit and he no longer wishes to pursue it before  the
    Upper Tribunal.

 3. Accordingly with my consent, and pursuant to rule 17(5) of the  Tribunal
    Procedure (Upper Tribunal)  Rules  2008,  this  appeal  is  recorded  as
    "Withdrawn with the consent of the Upper Tribunal".  This  is  a  Notice
    pursuant to rule 17(5) to inform the parties that the  appellant's  case
    is withdrawn.

 4. I am further satisfied  that  in  the  circumstances,  the  respondent's
    decision is no longer opposed, and  I  formally  remake  the  appeal  by
    dismissing it on all grounds.






Signed                              Date:  7 December 2015
