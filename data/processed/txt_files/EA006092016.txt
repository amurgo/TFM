                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     No appearances for the Appellant
For the Respondent:    Mr T Melvin, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The Appellant, a national of the Ukraine, date  of  birth  18  February
    1989, appealed the Respondent's decision,  dated  4  January  2016,  to
    refuse to issue an EEA residence card to the Appellant as  an  extended
    family member.  Her appeal came before First-tier Tribunal Judge Feeney
    who,on 3 April 2017, dismissed her appeal on the basis that  there  was
    no jurisdiction to entertain an appeal by an EFM reliant upon the  case
    of Sala (EFMs: Right of Appeal) [2016] UKUT  00411  (IAC).   The  Judge
    made no findings upon the claim to be an EFM and whether the  Appellant
    met the  requirements  under  Regulation  8  of  the  2006  Immigration
    (European Economic Area) Regulations.

2.   It is clear in the light of the case of Khan {2017] EWCA Civ 1755  that
    Sala is wrong. It is accepted by Mr Melvin that the Supreme  Court  has
    considered the application of the Secretary of State to  challenge  the
    decision of the Court of Appeal in  Khan  but   the  decision  of  Khan
    stands  and  is  binding  upon  this  Tribunal.   Accordingly   it   is
    appropriate that this matter is returned to the First-tier Tribunal  to
    be reconsidered, there being no findings of fact upon which  any  other
    decision may be substituted.  The Original Tribunal's  decision  cannot
    stand.

DECISION

The appeal is allowed to the extent that it is returned  to  the  First-tier
Tribunal to be remade in accordance with the law.

DIRECTIONS

(1)  List for hearing at Taylor House.

(2)  List one hour.

(3)  Russian/Ukrainian interpreter required.

(4)  List not before First-tier Tribunal Judge Feeney.

(5)  Relist for an oral hearing.

(6)  The parties or either of them to notify the First-tier  Tribunal  (IAC)
    if they do not wish to have an oral hearing on the issues.

No anonymity direction is made.

Signed                                  Date 7 March 2018
