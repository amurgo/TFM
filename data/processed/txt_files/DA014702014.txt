Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms G Thomas, Counsel instructed by Freemans
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr S Walker, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant is a national of Germany, born  on  28th  May  1964,  who
    claims to have arrived in the United Kingdom in  March  2003.   He  was
    issued with an EEA registration certificate  on  17th  September  2005,
    such certificate being valid until 17th September 2010.

 2. On 5th July 2011 the Appellant was convicted at Canterbury Crown  Court
    of "being knowingly concerned in fraudulent evasion of  prohibition  or
    restriction on  importation  of  Class  A  controlled  drugs"  and  was
    sentenced to a period of imprisonment of eight and a half years.

 3. On 16th July 2014 the Secretary of  State  made  a  decision  that  the
    Appellant should be deported  pursuant  to  the  Immigration  (European
    Economic Area) Regulations 2006 on the grounds of  public  policy.   In
    doing so the Secretary of State stated as follows:-

         "She [the Secretary of State] is satisfied that you  would  pose  a
         genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat to  the  interests
         of public policy if you were to be allowed to remain in the  United
         Kingdom and that your deportation is justified under Regulation 21.
          She has therefore  decided  under  Regulation  19(3)(b)  that  you
         should be removed and an order made in accordance  with  Regulation
         24(3), requiring you to leave the United  Kingdom  and  prohibiting
         you from re-entering while the order is in force.  For the  purpose
         of the order Section 3(5)(a)  of  the  Immigration  Act  1971  will
         apply."

    The Appellant appealed that decision to the First-tier  Tribunal  which
    was heard by the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Moore) on 9th December 2014
    and dismissed on all grounds in a  determination  promulgated  on  18th
    December 2014.

 4. He sought permission to appeal that decision and permission was granted
    by the First-tier Tribunal  (Judge  Shimmin)  in  a  decision  of  12th
    January 2015.

 5. On 2nd March 2015 the Appellant's appeal against the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal came before Upper Tribunal Judge O'Connor who in  a
    determination promulgated on 6th March 2015 found an error  of  law  in
    the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  in  assessing  whether  the
    Appellant represented a  "genuine,  present  and  sufficiently  serious
    threat affecting one of the fundamental  interests  of  society"  under
    Regulation 21(5)(c) of the 2006 EEA  Regulations.   At  [16]  of  Upper
    Tribunal Judge O'Connor's decision, he reached the conclusion  that  it
    was unclear from the determination  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  what
    conclusion the First-tier reached as  to  the  risk  of  the  Appellant
    reoffending upon his release from prison.  The error of  law  found  by
    Upper Tribunal Judge O'Connor was  set  out  in  the  determination  as
    follows:-

         "14. At the hearing before the Upper Tribunal  Mr  Melvin  accepted
             that the First-tier Tribunal had failed to make a  'definitive
             finding' as to the risk of the appellant reoffending upon  his
             release from prison.  It was asserted, nevertheless, that  the
             First-tier  Tribunal  had  been  entitled  to  find  that  the
             appellant represented  a  genuine,  present  and  sufficiently
             serious threat to the public.

         15.  In her reply Ms Thomas  changed  tack,  adopting  Mr  Melvin's
             position  that  the  First-tier   Tribunal   had   failed   to
             'definitively' rule on the risk of  the  appellant  committing
             further offences upon his release.   It  was  said  that  this
             failure of  itself  was  demonstrative  of  the  determination
             containing an error on a point of law requiring it to  be  set
             aside.

         16.  I  agree  with  the  parties  that  it  is  unclear  from  the
             determination what conclusion the FTT reached as to  the  risk
             of the appellant reoffending upon  his  release  from  prison.
             The words that I have emboldened in paragraph 11 above support
             the conclusion that there is a lack of clarity in  the  First-
             tier Tribunal's determination - the FTT appearing to initially
             proceed on the  basis  of  there  being  a  low  risk  of  the
             appellant reoffending, but then  concluding  -  on  the  wrong
             standard of proof - that the appellant's finances  on  release
             may well be limited, a feature which it  treats  as  enhancing
             such risk.

         17.  If the First-tier Tribunal found the OASys Report  not  to  be
             correct  in  its  conclusion,  and  approached  the  issue  of
             reoffending on the basis of there being a higher risk  of  the
             appellant  reoffending  than  that  identified  in  the  OASys
             Report, it was required to provide cogent  reasons  for  doing
             so.   There  are  no  such  reasons  to  be   found   in   the
             determination.  If, on the other hand, the First-tier Tribunal
             determined the appeal on the basis of the conclusion  set  out
             in the OASys Report, it is difficult to understand the root of
             its finding that the Appellant represents a  genuine,  present
             and sufficiently serious threat to the  fundamental  interests
             of society; given that the OASys Report concludes  that  there
             is a 1% chance of  the  appellant  reoffending  in  the  first
             twelve months after  his  release  and  a  3%  chance  of  him
             offending thereafter.

         18.  Consideration of the risk of the  appellant  reoffending  upon
             his release is, in the light of the terms of the OASys  Report
             and Regulation 21(5)(c) of the 2006 EEA Regulations,  the  key
             issue in this appeal and, absent the FTT making  a  clear  and
             reasoned finding on such an issue I find its determination  to
             be fundamentally flawed by legal error.

         19.  For this reason I set aside the determination  of  the  First-
             tier Tribunal.

         20.  I was unable to proceed immediately to determine the appeal on
             2 March because the appellant indicated an intention  to  call
             additional witnesses, there being an inability  to  call  such
             witnesses before the First-tier Tribunal because of the  short
             notice given to the appellant of the  change  of  the  hearing
             date (which had originally formed part of the  submissions  in
             relation to ground 1 of the appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal).
             Those witnesses were not in attendance before me  on  2  March
             and neither were they required  to  be,  given  the  terms  of
             paragraph 3 of the directions that  were  sent  out  with  the
             grant of permission.  In such circumstances  I  adjourned  the
             hearing of the appeal.

         21.  The remaking of the decision will be on  the  basis  that  the
             appellant has not attained a right of permanent  residence  in
             the United Kingdom, a matter accepted by Ms Thomas during  the
             course of the hearing.   Ms  Thomas  also  accepted  that  the
             appellant could not  succeed  on  Article  8  grounds,  absent
             success  on  the  2006  EEA  Regulations  ground.    In   such
             circumstances it was  sensibly  accepted  that  there  was  no
             utility in the Upper Tribunal determining the Article 8 ground
             upon its remaking of the decision."

 6. Consequently, Upper Tribunal Judge O'Connor set aside the  decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal.  This is a resumed hearing of an appeal by the
    Appellant, a citizen of Germany, born on 28th May 1964.  The appeal was
    adjourned for a resumed hearing in order  for  the  Upper  Tribunal  to
    remake the decision under the 2006 EEA Regulations and to hear the oral
    evidence (see paragraph 20 in UT decision on error of  law).  The  only
    witness to give oral evidence was to be the  Appellant  as  his  family
    members had not attended. Ms Thomas confirmed in her skeleton  argument
    and in her oral submissions the basis upon which the  remaking  of  the
    decision would be considered by the Upper Tribunal as set out  in  [21]
    of the decision of Upper Tribunal Judge O'Connor, namely  that  it  was
    accepted that the Appellant had  not  attained  a  permanent  right  of
    residence in the United Kingdom and also it was accepted that he  could
    not succeed on Article 8  grounds,  absent  success  on  the  2006  EEA
    Regulations ground  and  thus  the  Upper  Tribunal  would  proceed  to
    consider the appeal under the 2006 EEA Regulations.

 7. At the hearing, the Appellant gave  oral  evidence.   In  addition,  Ms
    Thomas on behalf of the  Appellant  placed  reliance  on  the  original
    documents that had been placed before the First-tier Tribunal that were
    contained under cover of a letter dated 2nd December 2014.  There were
    no further documents provided on the Appellant's behalf.  Ms Thomas had
    also produced a skeleton argument as directed by the Upper Tribunal.

 8. In his oral evidence the Appellant adopted his witness statement  found
    at pages 5-9 of the bundle.  He was asked in examination-in-chief  when
    he had become a German national and how he had acquired it.  He  stated
    that he acquired German  nationality  through  marriage  in  2001.   He
    stated in his evidence that he had entered the UK in  March  2003  from
    Germany and had  come  to  the  United  Kingdom  because  he  found  it
    difficult to  study  in  the  German  language.   He  was  asked  about
    paragraph 7 of his witness statement and what he understood to  be  the
    negative impact of his criminality and what he meant by it.  He  stated
    that before the offences he did not fully understand the full impact of
    the offence until he came to the United Kingdom.  He saw drug users and
    that was how he found out the impact was "not  so  good".   When  asked
    what he learned about the impact he stated, "I saw some people, junkies
    and drug users, I saw them in prison and I saw  that  they  were  given
    treatment in prison".  When asked how did he feel when he saw that,  he
    stated, "I didn't feel good".  When asked,  "Why  not"  he  stated,  "I
    didn't know that my actions would put them in this situation".

 9. He was directed to the certificate in the bundle of the course entitled
    "Learning to be financially capable".  He was asked what he  had  taken
    on the course and he stated that he had previously  studied  accounting
    and finance (BA degree) but this course related to budgeting  and  that
    it would help him with his problems on release.  He was asked what kind
    of techniques he would use and he said, "I will spend what I have".  He
    was asked about his proposals for full-time employment upon release and
    the Appellant said that he had spoken  to  the  Probation  Service  and
    discussed going back to work with the National  Rail  Network  as  they
    work with ex-offenders.  He said he would have to  take  a  health  and
    safety course when he had been released before he could  undertake  any
    such employment.  He said that the employment was nothing  to  do  with
    accountancy.

10. In answer to questions by Mr Walker, he  confirmed  the  date  that  he
    first went to Germany  was  in  1990  as  he  was  working  there.   He
    confirmed that he had come to the UK to study in 2003  and  the  course
    was accounting and finance.  He said that he had worked in Germany  for
    the German Postal Service.  When  asked  about  his  work  and  studies
    between 2003 and 2010, he stated in his evidence that he had arrived in
    the UK in September 2003 and studied until June 2004.  He  stopped  and
    was working in January 2004 full-time  until  July/September  2006  and
    then went back to finish his studies until  2010.   Between  the  years
    2004 and 2006 he stated that he had worked for the NCP  Car  Park.   He
    confirmed that his family joined him in 2005.  He  was  asked  why  his
    family and wife had not attended court.  He could give no reason  other
    to say that they were supposed to be at court  and  made  reference  to
    having been diagnosed as diabetic.  He claimed that the  last  time  he
    spoke to his family was two days ago but he did not have much credit on
    his phone.  He was asked about the end of his studies in 2013 and  what
    qualification he had obtained.  He stated that he had obtained a BA  in
    Accounting and Finance.  As to his current plans, he confirmed that  he
    had not undertaken the course which was  in  health  and  safety  which
    would be required if he  were  to  take  up  any  employment  with  the
    National Rail Network.  He thought that it would  be  inspecting  work,
    for example being a health officer.

11. In re-examination he was asked  about  his  degree  in  accounting  and
    finance and the difference from the course that he  had  undertaken  in
    prison.  He stated the  course  in  prison  helped  him  to  understand
    budgeting more clearly and that the degree was theoretical.

12. In answer to  further  questions,  he  was  asked  about  his  criminal
    offending and why it was necessary to take part in the  crime,  bearing
    in mind he had been in employment and studying.  He stated that it  was
    due to "financial pressure".  When asked to explain what  pressures  he
    was under he stated that he had to  repay  his  tuition  fees  of  over
    �20,000.  He confirmed that there was still over  �20,000  to  be  paid
    which is why he had to go and get a job.   When  asked  if  there  were
    other  financial  pressures,  he  stated  it  was  just  to  pay   that
    outstanding sum off.  When asked about his trips to  the  continent  in
    bringing gemstones to the UK,  when  asked  why  it  was  necessary  to
    undertake that work when his wife was working, he stated  that  he  was
    getting commission for bringing in the  gems.   When  asked  about  his
    claim in the OASys Report about taking the 101 pellets and that he  did
    not know that they were drugs, he confirmed that he did not  know  that
    they were drugs in the pellets when he took them.  However, when he was
    told that that was what they were he  then  accepted  it.   When  asked
    about his budgeting and why it was necessary to go on such a course, he
    stated that he had considered it in a "broader way" and how  to  handle
    his finances.

13. As to his employment in Germany, he confirmed that he had  worked  with
    the Post Office between 1998 to 2001 which meant that  he  was  sorting
    letters in the Postal Service.  He said that he understood  German  (as
    the letters would be written in German) and he knew where they  had  to
    go.  He confirmed that after this he worked in a  warehouse  delivering
    phones to companies and putting them on the shelves in  the  warehouse.
    He also drove a forklift truck and confirmed that he had  had  training
    in Germany.  As to hobbies and interests, he stated that he had  played
    football between 1990 to 2003 and also tried to read.  He  stated  that
    he had learnt German but he found it difficult to speak.  In answer  to
    a question by Ms Thomas as to how well he could speak German he  stated
    that he could speak about "50%".  In answer to questions by  Mr  Walker
    he confirmed that he would understand the German supervisors who  spoke
    to him in German and  that  he  could  reply  to  them  in  the  German
    language.  He also stated that he obtained training to use the forklift
    truck that were written instructions and he could  follow  them.   They
    were not difficult to understand.

The Submissions

14. Mr Walker on behalf of the Secretary of State relied upon  the  refusal
    letter dated 16th July 2014.  As to his level of integration and rights
    of residence, whilst he claimed to have arrived in March 2003,  he  was
    issued with an EEA registration certificate in September 2005 that  was
    valid for five years.  He had not provided any evidence to that he  had
    been exercising treaty rights in the United Kingdom.  He submitted that
    in the light of the matters set out in the refusal letter and the  fact
    that he had provided no evidence of his employment prior to his  arrest
    for drugs offences, the Secretary of State did not accept that  he  had
    acquired a right of permanent residence.  There was nothing to show any
    permanent employment in terms of integration within the United Kingdom.
     He further submitted prior to moving to the United Kingdom most of his
    adult life he had lived in  Germany  and  that  his  evidence  was  not
    credible as to what he claimed concerning his ability to speak  German,
    bearing in mind the length of residence from 1990-2003, the  fact  that
    he had worked in the Post Office and at Motorola and had been driving a
    forklift truck.  In those circumstances it was likely  that  he  had  a
    high level of proficiency and that in light of any  return  to  Germany
    there would be no barrier to  him  in  understanding  or  speaking  the
    language.

15. He directed the Tribunal to the refusal letter and  the  assessment  of
    threat at paragraphs 15  to  28  including  the  circumstances  of  the
    offence at [16] and the NOMS1 assessment at [19].   He  submitted  that
    the Secretary of State submitted that this was a very serious  offence,
    importing  large  amounts  of  Class  A  drugs  as  a  courier  and  as
    demonstrated by the sentence of eight and a half years' imprisonment.

16. Mr Walker relied upon the refusal letter  and  further  submitted  that
    because of his past situation, having never been in  proper  employment
    when in the United Kingdom other  than  working  by  way  of  importing
    gemstones, his employment had not been significant thus that led  to  a
    risk of reoffending as if he could not manage his finances  as  in  the
    past it would lead to  the  Appellant  being  a  risk  to  society  and
    consequent risk of harm to the public.  Thus  he  submitted  he  had  a
    propensity to reoffend and would represent a genuine and present threat
    to the public and thus his deportation was justified on the grounds  of
    public policy.

17.  He  submitted  that  the  Secretary  of  State  had   considered   the
    rehabilitation of the Appellant but as  he  did  not  show  significant
    integration in the UK and a lack of evidence of regular employment, the
    fact that his wife and two adult stepdaughters were unable  to  prevent
    the Appellant committing such a serious offence and  had  no  influence
    upon  him,  those  factors  taken  together  would  not  prejudice  any
    prospects  of  rehabilitation  in  the  future  in  Germany.   Thus  he
    submitted that his deportation was proportionate.

18. I asked Mr Walker for his submissions concerning the OASys  report  and
    what evidence he relied upon to support any view that the report  could
    be departed from. He submitted that the report  should  be  taken  into
    account but that as the Appellant had a serious  conviction  for  drugs
    this would lead to a propensity to offend.

19. Ms Thomas on behalf of the Appellant relied upon her skeleton  argument
    which set out the appropriate legal framework that should  be  applied.
    She began her submissions by stating that there was  no  question  that
    the offence of which the Appellant was convicted was a serious  one  as
    reflected in the sentence imposed and that if this had not been an  EEA
    case he would  be  struggling  to  make  a  case  against  deportation.
    However, the EEA Regulations make it  clear  that  a  previous  offence
    cannot by itself justify deportation which is why Regulation 19 must be
    read in conjunction with Regulation 21.   She  further  submitted  that
    whilst it was a serious offence it was a single  offence  and  did  not
    establish a propensity.

20. In considering Regulation 21(5)(c) she submitted that it  was  not  met
    because he no longer posed a present threat to one of  the  fundamental
    interests of society.  She placed reliance upon the  OASys  Report  and
    that the Probation Service's assessment was that  he  presented  a  low
    risk of reoffending (1% in the first year following release and  3%  in
    the first two  years  following  release).   She  recognised  that  the
    Tribunal was not bound to follow the conclusions of  the  OASys  Report
    but to depart from it there should be cogent  evidence  pointing  to  a
    higher risk profile.  In this case she submitted,  there  was  no  such
    evidence.

21. She relied upon the other evidence set out in her skeleton argument  at
    paragraph 7 which she stated supported her principal submission that he
    no longer posed a  genuine  or  present  threat.   She  submitted  that
    financial management had been the focus of offending but  that  he  had
    achieved his sentence plan objective of improving his financial  skills
    (see OASys Report page 48).  In addition the assessment was that he was
    "very motivated" to address his  offending.   The  Appellant  had  been
    trusted in both open conditions and on ROTL without incident  (page  21
    of  the  OASys  Report)  and  there  were  no  discipline   issues   or
    adjudications in the  course  of  his  sentence  and  he  had  attained
    enhanced status (page 46 of the OASys Report).  He was also  awarded  a
    trusted position within the prison estate.

22. She further submitted that the fact that he had  completed  the  course
    was significant as it pointed to a lower risk of reoffending.

23. She further submitted that even if the Tribunal  shared  the  probation
    officer's scepticism as to the purpose of the previous trips undertaken
    by the Appellant, they predate the Appellant's imprisonment  which  has
    clearly served not only to punish but to rehabilitate  but  importantly
    the fact that the Appellant had  undertaken  such  previous  trips  was
    already known to the author of the OASys Report and had therefore  been
    weighed in the assessment of risk.  For those  reasons,  she  submitted
    that the Secretary of State could not justify deportation by  reference
    to the serious harm that would be caused if he were to involve  himself
    in the importation of drugs at paragraph  25  of  the  refusal  letter.
    This was because there was a low  risk  of  reoffending  and  therefore
    could not satisfy Regulation 21(5)(c).  That  Regulation  is  concerned
    with a genuine threat and cannot  be  satisfied  by  reference  to  the
    gravity of any potential threat.

24. As to proportionality, she submitted that he had been resident  in  the
    UK for over twelve years and that he has no social and  family  network
    in Germany nor does he speak the language well.  She submitted that  he
    had  been  frank  in  his  replies  concerning  his  language  and  his
    employment in Germany.  She submitted that employment prospects  go  to
    the Appellant's financial stability which was an  important  factor  in
    ensuring  his  continued  rehabilitation  and  therefore   a   material
    consideration  within  the  proportionality  exercise   (see   SSHD   v
    Dumliauskas and Others [2015] EWCA Civ 145).  Thus she  submitted  that
    he could develop social  ties  but  the  question  of  whether  it  was
    proportionate is a comparative exercise weighing those factors  against
    the low risk of reoffending.   Therefore  in  those  circumstances  she
    invited the Tribunal to find that the Appellant no longer represented a
    genuine, present and sufficiently serious  threat  to  the  fundamental
    interests  of  society  and  that  his  deportation  to   Germany   was
    disproportionate.

25. I reserved my determination.

The Legislative Framework

26. There is no dispute as to the legislative framework that I should apply
    in this appeal.  The Appellant is  an  EU  citizen  and  therefore  his
    deportation is governed by the provisions of the Immigration  (European
    Economic Area) Regulations 2006  (as  amended)  which  give  effect  to
    Directive 2004/38/EC.

27. The basis  of  the  Appellant's  deportation  is  found  in  Regulation
    19(3)(b) of the 2006 EEA Regulations which provides as follows:

         "An EEA national who has entered the  United  Kingdom  ...  may  be
         removed if-

         ...

         (b)  the Secretary of State has decided that the  person's  removal
             is justified on grounds of public policy, public  security  or
             public health in accordance with Regulation 21; ..."

28. Where a decision is taken to  remove  an  individual  under  Regulation
    19(3)(b), Regulation 24(3) states that:

         "The person is to be treated as if he were a person to whom Section
         3(5)(a) of the 1971 Act (liability  to  deportation)  applied,  and
         Section 5 of that Act (procedure for deportation) and Schedule 3 to
         that Act (supplementary provision as to deportation) are  to  apply
         accordingly."

29. Therefore once a lawful decision under  the  Regulations  is  taken  to
    remove such an individual, the power to deport found in  the  1971  Act
    can be applied as it was in the case of this Appellant.

30. As both parties have stated, Regulation 21 is central  to  this  appeal
    and, so far as relevant, provides as follows:

         "21  (1) In this Regulation a  'relevant  decision'  means  an  EEA
                  decision taken on the grounds  of  public  policy,  public
                  security or public health.

             (2)  A relevant decision may not be taken  to  serve  economic
             ends.

             ...

             (5)  Where a relevant decision is taken on grounds  of  public
                  policy  or  public  security  it  shall,  in  addition  to
                  complying  with   the   preceding   paragraphs   of   this
                  Regulation, be taken  in  accordance  with  the  following
                  principles-

                  (a)  the  decision  must  comply  with  the  principle  of
                      proportionality;

                  (b)   the  decision  must  be  based  exclusively  on  the
                      personal conduct of the person concerned;

                  (c)  the personal conduct of  the  person  concerned  must
                      represent a genuine, present and sufficiently serious
                      threat affecting one of the fundamental interests  of
                      society;

                  (d)  matters isolated from the particulars of the case  or
                      which relate to considerations of general  prevention
                      do not justify the decision;

                  (e)  a person's previous criminal convictions  do  not  in
                      themselves justify the decision.

             (6)  Before taking a  relevant  decision  on  the  grounds  of
                  public policy or public security in relation to  a  person
                  who is resident in the United Kingdom the  decision  maker
                  must take account of considerations such as the age, state
                  of health, family and economic situation  of  the  person,
                  the person's length of residence in  the  United  Kingdom,
                  the person's social  and  cultural  integration  into  the
                  United Kingdom and the extent of the person's  links  with
                  his country of origin."

31.  The Appellant is an EEA national and consequently his deportation must
    comply with the requirements of the 2006 Regulations and in particular,
    Regulation 21.  It was conceded before Upper  Tribunal  Judge  O'Connor
    that the Appellant could not establish a right of  permanent  residence
    in the United Kingdom and therefore the heightened level of  protection
    in Regulation 21(3) requiring  proof  of  "serious  grounds  of  public
    policy" did not apply.  Thus the decision must be taken on "the grounds
    of public policy, public security or public health", Regulation  21(1).
    For the purposes of this appeal, the Regulation set out  at  21(5)  and
    (6) are relevant and are set out in the preceding paragraphs.

32. Regulation 21(5)(c) requires the personal conduct  of  the  prospective
    deportee to represent a  "genuine,  present  and  sufficiently  serious
    threat affecting one of  the  fundamental  interests  of  society."   A
    "threat affecting one of the fundamental interests of society" means  a
    threat to do something prohibited by law (see GW  (Netherlands)  [2009]
    UKAIT  00050).   In  order  to  represent  a  "genuine,   present   and
    sufficiently serious threat" it is necessary to establish a future risk
    of reoffending and this assessment is required as to how likely  it  is
    an offender will reoffend  and  the  nature  and  seriousness  of  such
    offences.  Thus it is only then an individual would present a "present"
    threat.

33. I remind myself that past offending may be relevant in assessing future
    risk but the seriousness of the past conviction and indeed the fact  he
    has a past conviction cannot in itself justify the deportation of an EU
    national,  unlike  the  provisions  that  deal  with  non-EEA   foreign
    criminals.

34. In the decision of Upper Tribunal Judge  O'Connor,  he  identified  the
    issue in this case that had  given  rise  to  the  error  of  law  that
    findings relevant to this issue had not been  made  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal in respect of the evidence and in particular the OASys  Report
    and the information contained within it which stated that the  risk  of
    reoffending was 1%.

35. I therefore begin with the relevant personal conduct of the  appellant.
    This refers to the Appellant's criminal offending  and  the  conviction
    for  knowingly  being  concerned  with  the   fraudulent   evasion   of
    prohibition or restriction on importation of class A drugs for which he
    received a sentence of eight and a half years' imprisonment.

36. The sentencing remarks of the judge who imposed the sentence are brief.
     The judge stated as follows:-

         "This is a very serious offence.  Class A drugs do  immense  damage
         to the user and have grave consequences to the community at  large,
         increased crime, hardship to family of the user and also  violence.
         There have to be deterrent  sentences  for  those  who  traffic  in
         drugs.  I take into account in your case that  you  are  put  as  a
         courier and no more than that, you are not an organiser in any  way
         and I shall sentence you on that basis.  I take into  account  your
         good character; your age and all that has been said  about  you  by
         your Counsel.  I also take into account your plea of guilty, albeit
         at the stage of the commencement of the trial and therefore it will
         be limited credit only that you will receive, but nevertheless  you
         will receive some credit in relation to that late plea.  There  has
         to be a sentence of imprisonment in this case, as it is conceded by
         your Counsel, and it has to be a lengthy sentence of  imprisonment.
         Taking into account all that I have heard about you and read  about
         you, the shortest sentence  which,  in  my  judgment,  matches  the
         seriousness of this  offence,  and  taking  into  account  all  the
         mitigation that has been put before me, is one of eight and a  half
         years' imprisonment.  ..."

37. The circumstances of the offence are not  set  out  in  the  sentencing
    remarks of the judge but are summarised in the decision letter  of  the
    Secretary of State at  paragraphs  16-18.   The  circumstances  of  the
    offence was that on 26th November 2010 he  attempted  to  pass  through
    Dover Eastern Dock having disembarked a Eurolines  Coach  from  Antwerp
    and was intercepted by Customs Officers.  He had been travelling  on  a
    German ID card.  When questioned, he stated that  the  reason  for  his
    trip to Belgium was that he had received a phone  call  from  a  family
    member in Nigeria asking him to look at  the  prices  of  semi-precious
    stones and making jewellery.  He had in his  possession  a  list  which
    purported to be a price list for various stones.  He stated that he did
    not have any accommodation for the trip and following  a  strip  search
    and scan it was found that he had in his body 101  wrapped  pellets  of
    cocaine.

38. During his interview, he explained that he had met an old  friend  from
    Nigeria in Germany where he used to reside who now lived in Antwerp and
    owned a jewellery shop.   He  said  that  when  he  was  a  student  at
    Greenwich University he made extra money where he would courier  jewels
    to and from Antwerp for his friend.  He had made commission from  this.
    He stated that his friend in Antwerp had ended up getting into debt and
    lost his shop in a fire so his friend needed to get  some  money.   The
    Appellant was taken by his friend and two other  men  to  a  house  and
    threatened at gunpoint to take  a  package  to  London.   He  had  been
    informed that his mother had been taken hostage to ensure that he would
    complete the delivery and it was stated  she  had  been  held  for  two
    months.  He also stated that he was promised  �3,000  for  making  this
    trip but he never received any payment.  He was forced to  swallow  101
    packages which he believed to be precious stones.  Whilst it  had  been
    noted that he had made 80 near identical trips prior  to  the  incident
    and they were for bringing precious stones into  England,  he  believed
    this to be a legal business and had carried the stones in his pocket.

39. There is no doubt that the Appellant's offence  is  a  serious  one  as
    demonstrated by the  details  and  circumstances  of  the  offence  and
    ultimately by the length of sentence imposed.  As required  by  the  EU
    Regulations, the Tribunal  must  make  an  assessment  of  whether  the
    Appellant represents  a  "genuine,  present  and  sufficiently  serious
    threat affecting one of the fundamental  interests  of  society".   The
    sentencing judge made no reference to any future risk  of  reoffending.
    Miss Thomas  has  confirmed  that  there  was  no  pre-sentence  report
    available to the judge when sentencing the Appellant and the  basis  of
    the mitigation is not set out in the sentencing judge's remarks.

40. There are however two OASys Reports that have been provided.  The first
    OASys Report is at D1 onwards in the  Respondent's  bundle  dated  20th
    January 2014.  At Section 3 of the form, the level of risk  of  serious
    harm is indicated to be "low",  having  taken  into  account  the  risk
    factors relevant to the Appellant, namely, his  association  with  pro-
    criminal peers, vulnerability to those  involved  in  legal  drugs  and
    deficit thinking skills.  This is an offence that was carried  out  for
    financial gain.  As to those potentially at  risk  it  was  noted  that
    there was no direct victim identified but victims of the  illicit  drug
    industry are the  users  whose  health,  relationship,  livelihood  and
    liberty are often adversely affected and the general public who are the
    victim of acquisitive crime.  It also refers to the Appellant  being  a
    risk to himself having ingested the drugs in order to carry them.   The
    offence summary is set out section 4 as set out earlier.  As to  issues
    of accommodation, it made reference to his previous  residence,  living
    with his family at the family home with his wife and two stepdaughters.
     The plan was to resume this family life there and it is recorded  that
    he had a successful ROTL to that address.  His education, training  and
    employment  is  dealt  with  at  D3  referring  to  his  qualifications
    (multiple GCSEs and accounting qualifications).  He  had  a  degree  in
    accounting and finance and at the time of arrest  was  studying  for  a
    Sage 50 in accounting.  His further plans were set out to  embark  upon
    employment in the railways upon release.

41. The work undertaken in prison was summarised, namely he  had  completed
    an OCR level in IT user skills (April 2011), OCR  level  2  ITQ  in  IT
    skills (September 2011) and also obtained an OCR level 3 ITQ award.  He
    had completed a financial course in education OCR level 1, learning  to
    be "financially capable" (confirmed by the Education  Department).   He
    had no issues as a drug user or with alcohol that could  be  linked  to
    his offending behaviour.  As to lifestyle and associates, it refers  to
    the jewellery runs made in the past.  There was no evidence  that  this
    was illegal but it was considered to be linked to his  behaviour.   The
    circumstances of the offence swallowing packages showed also  a  degree
    of risk taken to himself.

42. The summary of the OASys Report was that he was assessed at a low  risk
    of reoffending based on the Offender Group  Reconviction  Scale  (OGRS)
    which showed the risk of reconviction as 1% within twelve months and 3%
    within 24 months and the low risk of serious  harm  to  others,  albeit
    putting himself at risk by ingesting packages.

43. Thus the 1% risk of reoffending took into account the circumstances  of
    the offence, his previous  association  with  the  peers  he  had  been
    involved with, the financial motivation  for  the  index  offence,  his
    compliance with the educational courses relevant to the risks  relating
    to financial management and his family links and  his  educational  and
    employment (it was recognised that he was unemployed at the time of the
    offences).

44. The most recent update of the OASys Report is dated 14th October  2014.
    At page 2 it notes the offender has not been identified as  a  prolific
    or other priority offender and the purpose of his sentence as  recorded
    is "punishment".  The box for reform and rehabilitation  has  not  been
    ticked.  The sources  of  information  for  the  report  refer  to  the
    previous OASys Reports (which  includes  information  provided  by  the
    Appellant) and also the prison records.  An analysis of the offence was
    set out at page 7 which repeated that of the earlier OASys Report.   It
    was noted at page 8 that the main motivation of the index  offence  was
    financial gain and gave the circumstances of where the appellant stated
    he had been threatened or coerced to carry out the offence.  As to  his
    attitude towards  the  offence,  the  report  noted  that  he  accepted
    responsibility   for   the   offence   and   thus   acknowledged   full
    responsibility for the offence although it was noted he stated  he  had
    been under duress and did not think the packages contained drugs.   His
    account was as before and that he had previously lived  in  the  family
    home with his wife and two stepdaughters and that he had been  back  to
    the house there on successful ROTLs.  At page 9, the  issue  identified
    which contributed to risk of harm was the emotional state at  the  time
    of the offence and the financial motivation.  At page 11 it noted  that
    he would be unemployed on release  and  identified  problems  with  his
    employment history.  Financial management was considered  at  page  13.
    It was noted that he had problems with financial matters  in  the  past
    referring to his student loan of �27,000 and the  index  offence  being
    for financial gain.  It summarised that he had financial issues  linked
    to  offending  behaviour.    The   evidence   concerning   his   family
    relationships was summarised at  page  14.   It  referred  to  a  close
    relationship with both the family in the  UK  and  that  his  wife  and
    daughters were embarrassed by  him  being  in  prison  but  they  still
    supported him.  He said that he had a home to return to and  wished  to
    do so to live with his wife and daughter.   He  had  been  married  for
    seven years and that they were still very supportive  and  referred  to
    the successful ROTL so that they could spend time together.

45. Dealing with lifestyle and associates that was considered as before and
    the relevant considerations referred to the author's scepticism of  his
    account that he did not know what he was carrying when caught at  Dover
    Docks.  As to thinking and behaviour skills, it was  reported  that  he
    had an ability to recognise problems but had a problem with impulsivity
    and awareness of  consequences.   The  conditions  of  moving  precious
    stones was also considered but noting that there was no evidence before
    the Probation Services that it was  illegal  activity  but  thought  it
    could offence of possible pro-criminal attitude.  The Appellant  stated
    that he was remorseful for his past actions (page 27) and  stated  that
    he had wasted years of his life in prison and for his sake and that  of
    his family he would never contemplate offending again.

46. A summary of the OASys Report can be found at page 33.  It demonstrates
    that  the  identified  risks  that  were  taken  into  account  in  the
    assessment of the risk of reoffending and the risk category related  to
    finance, employment, lifestyle and associates, thinking  and  behaviour
    and attitude.  The risk of reoffending was placed at 1% for  the  first
    twelve months and 3% after 24 months.  The categorisation was "low".

47. His compliance and behaviour was also summarised at page 35  confirming
    that there had been no discipline issues, there were no warnings as  to
    any offences, there was no refusal of  mandatory  drug  tests  nor  had
    there  been  any  positive  results  on  such  tests,  there  had  been
    successful ROTL, no proven adjudications and that he  had  an  enhanced
    level as a prisoner.  His motivation was described as "very  motivated"
    and as to the financial risks he was described as having carried out  a
    course of being "financially capable" and that the object of  improving
    these financial skills was "fully achieved".

48. The courts have recognised that an OASys Report is a document  compiled
    by a trained Probation Officer and cannot be lightly dismissed (see  AM
    v SSHD [2012] EWCA Civ 163 and the decision of the  Upper  Tribunal  in
    Secretary of State for the Home Department v  Vasconcelos  [2013]  UKUT
    06378).  As Miss Thomas recognised in her submissions, it  is  open  to
    the Tribunal to depart from the findings of such a report if  there  is
    evidence upon which to do so.  The decision of Vasconcelos  (as  cited)
    makes it plain that in assessing whether an EEA national  represents  a
    current threat to  public  policy  by  the  risk  of  reoffending,  the
    Tribunal should consider the assessment provided but was not  bound  to
    it if the overall assessment of the evidence supports a conclusion of a
    continued risk.

49. I now turn to an assessment of the evidence.  The Appellant gave  short
    evidence before the Tribunal and in general terms there were no  issues
    of  credibility  or  inconsistency  raised  concerning  that  evidence.
    Indeed his evidence reflected that already set out  in  his  interviews
    for the OASys Report and the evidence that was  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

50. The report outlined as a risk factor financial issues.  It sets out and
    had regard to his previous qualifications in accounting and finance; he
    was also assessed upon his personal circumstances at the time of  being
    unemployed (but in education) and that he  had  a  debt  by  way  of  a
    student loan of �27,000 and he had successfully completed a  course  on
    being financially capable which had been fully complied with.   I  find
    that none of that information has been either displaced or  changed  in
    the evidence given by  the  Appellant  or  put  before  this  Tribunal.
    Whilst it is right that he had a degree in accountancy and finance  and
    therefore the question as to  why  it  was  necessary  to  undertake  a
    further course arises, I consider that there is a  distinction  between
    learning about accounting on a theoretical level  and  that  which  was
    identified from his personal circumstances which  was  to  be  able  to
    manage his own personal finances which I find  is  very  different  and
    distinct.  In this regard, I accept the evidence that  he  successfully
    completed the course of being "financially capable" as it  is  referred
    to in the OAsys Report and confirmed by the education  providers.   The
    course content appears to cover all the relevant skills in  his  field.
    The Appellant's evidence, which was unchallenged, was that part of  the
    course related to budgeting, a matter that he identified  as  requiring
    specific assistance with by reference to his past conduct.

51. His evidence made reference to the future plans for employment and that
    was to undertake a health and safety course to enable him  to  work  in
    the railway industry as it is said that they  work  with  ex-offenders.
    This is consistent with the evidence in the OASys Report and  there  is
    no reason to believe that such work is either not available for him  or
    that he is unsuitable for this work.  It is likely that this  has  been
    discussed during his time in custody as part of the process to  support
    life in the community.

52. The Probation Service did not identify any further work in this area or
    indeed any other courses that they thought necessary to reduce the risk
    of reoffending.

53. The OASys  Report  made  reference  to  his  accommodation  issues  and
    considered this in the light of what was described as his strong family
    life with his wife and two  daughters.   I  have  considered  this  and
    observed that I have not had the advantage of hearing from  members  of
    his family  in  oral  evidence  although  they  have  provided  written
    statements.  The contents of those statements are consistent  with  and
    corroborate the Appellant's evidence that his wife  and  daughters  are
    still supportive of him.  I do question why, if that is  so,  they  did
    not attend court.  I recognise that the report makes reference  to  his
    wife and daughters and their  embarrassment  concerning  the  issue  of
    offending and I would accept that this must have caused  them  personal
    distress and could be a contributing factor as  to  why  they  did  not
    attend court.  Nonetheless in the light of their  absence  ,  I  attach
    less weight to those statements although I observe that Mr  Walker  did
    not indicate that he would challenge their contents.  However there  is
    other evidence that corroborates the continuity of  family  life.   The
    OASys Report refers to the ROTL periods at home and  when  this  matter
    was before the First-tier Tribunal  there  had  been  six  home  visits
    lasting between four to five days and I find that it is not likely that
    such arrangements for temporary release to that address would have been
    made  if  the  family  members  were  not  supportive  of  him.   Thus,
    notwithstanding their non-attendance, I am satisfied on the balance  of
    probabilities that there is evidence that  they continue to support the
    Appellant and that his plans for resuming his family life with his wife
    and daughters remains.

54. The Appellant gave evidence before me of  regretting  his  offence  and
    that before the offence he did not understand the full impact  of  such
    offending behaviour and referred to seeing those who took drugs  whilst
    he had been in custody.  The evidence is consistent with  the  evidence
    as assessed by the Probation Service in which it was stated that he did
    accept full responsibility for the offence and was described as "highly
    motivated" to change.  I observe that he stated before me that  he  did
    not think the packages were drugs when he took them  but  when  he  was
    told what they were, he accepted responsibility  for  the  offence  and
    indeed pleaded guilty to it which was reflected in the discount he  was
    given on his plea.  I have to say I share  the  view  set  out  in  the
    Probation Report that it is highly unlikely  that  he  would  not  have
    known that he was swallowing drugs;  there  is  no  evidence  that  the
    previous trips to the continent involved the swallowing of gems, indeed
    the evidence was that he carried them in his pocket.  However that  was
    a view shared by Probation Officers and factored into the assessment of
    risk and there cannot be stated to be any additional  or  new  evidence
    that the Probation Services either overlooked or did not  take  account
    of and was therefore properly assessed  and  quantified  in  the  OASys
    Report.

55. As to his evidence of regretting the offence it is of  course  easy  to
    state such a sentiment in the  knowledge  that  there  are  deportation
    proceedings  pending.   However  the  OASys  Report   identifies   this
    Appellant as "highly motivated" to change and on  the  evidence  before
    the Tribunal based on his conduct in prison, provides support for  that
    view.  None of that evidence has been challenged by  the  Secretary  of
    State.  He has successfully completed a number of courses  relevant  to
    employability prospects for the future and has had, whilst in  custody,
    a full-time job with the stores which was a trusted and privileged job.
     He had been granted category B  status  and  transferred  to  an  open
    prison in November 2013 and was engaged in work in the  print  shop  as
    well as working as a volunteer worker with  a  children's  hospice  and
    during his time raised finances in order for the  hospice  to  be  run.
    The OASys Report in addition marked any absence of  disruptive  issues,
    proven adjudications  and  his  attainment  of  enhanced  status  as  a
    prisoner in which he was awarded a trusted position within  the  prison
    environment.  His behaviour  has  not  been  tested  in  the  community
    because he has remained in custody  after  the  custodial  element  had
    expired.

56. During the course of submissions I asked Mr Walker  on  behalf  of  the
    Secretary of State to identify to the Tribunal any  facts  or  evidence
    relied upon to demonstrate a departure from the assessment of  risk  in
    the OASys Report.  He  submitted  that  if  he  could  not  manage  his
    finances he would be at risk of reoffending and  also  that  he  had  a
    propensity to reoffend and further submitted that this  was  a  serious
    conviction of importation of drugs and thus  he  would  reoffend  in  a
    similar situation.

57. I have considered the refusal letter and the points raised therein.  It
    made reference to the OASys  Report  and  the  NOMS  1  assessment  and
    acknowledged in a number of paragraphs the assessment was that  he  had
    posed a low risk  of  harm  to  the  public  and  of  reoffending  (see
    paragraphs 19 to  26).   A  careful  examination  of  those  paragraphs
    demonstrate that they set out the  risk  factors  at  paragraph  19  by
    reference to association with pro-criminal peers, vulnerability  to  be
    influenced and deficit thinking skills.   All  of  those  factors  were
    taken into account in the assessment of risk by the probation services.
     The risk to the Appellant at paragraph 20 again was a  factor  already
    considered in the report.  The paragraphs also make  reference  to  the
    Appellant's previous conviction and the circumstances of this.  This is
    relevant to the personal conduct of the Appellant but  as  to  evidence
    relied upon as  to  demonstrate  an  enhanced  risk  of  offending  the
    Secretary of State has set out that  this  is  to  be  referred  to  as
    "potential" to reoffend  (see  paragraph  26)  and  that  the  evidence
    suggested that he had a "propensity" to offend.

58. The decision letter also sets out the harmful effects of drugs offences
    which have on the community and rightly so acknowledged the harm to the
    public.  It also again referred to the low risk of reoffending.

59. I have carefully considered the Secretary of State's letter, however  I
    do not find that the Respondent has either referred to any evidence  or
    engaged with the test  that  should  be  considered,  namely,  how  the
    assessment made by the Probation Services in the OASys Report, a report
    that should be given weight, of a 1% risk of reoffending impacts on the
    legal test set out in Regulation 21(5)(c).  At its highest the  refusal
    letter makes reference to the offence itself and the  harm  that  would
    ensue if such an offence was committed  again  but  does  not  properly
    consider the test as to whether  a  1%  risk  of  reoffending  and  the
    assessment in the OASys Report  represented  a  "genuine,  present  and
    sufficiently serious threat" or committing an offence  to  justify  his
    removal from the UK.

60. I do not consider  that  from  the  circumstances  of  the  offence  he
    committed that he can properly be described as having a "propensity" to
    commit such crimes.  He has not committed any drugs offences before and
    was a man of good character.  Whilst there has been reference  made  to
    the large number of trips made to the continent, there was no  evidence
    before the Probation  Officers  nor  before  this  Tribunal  that  that
    conduct was illegal.  There remains a question  mark  concerning  those
    visits but that is far from supporting a  propensity  to  commit  drugs
    offences.

61.  Consequently I have reached the conclusion from the assessment of  the
    evidence before me that it  has  not  been  established  by  any  other
    evidence that the assessment of the Probation Service in  the  form  of
    the OASys Report either miscategorised the risk of reoffending or  that
    they had failed to take into account any relevant matter when  reaching
    that assessment.  It has not been demonstrated that the  assessment  of
    the Probation Services should  be  displaced  either  in  the  evidence
    before me or by Miss Walker referring me to evidence  in  this  regard.
    Not only was the risk categorised as low, it went so far  as  to  place
    the risk on the scale at 1%.   Thus  the  expert  evidence  before  the
    Tribunal which is not diminished and is consistent  with  the  evidence
    before this Tribunal points in the  Appellant's  favour.   I  have  had
    regard to the decision  of  Essay  (Essay:  rehabilitation/integration)
    [2013] UKUT 316 and in particular at paragraphs  32  in  which  it  was
    stated:-

         "We observe that for any deportation  of  an  EEA  national  to  be
         justified on public good grounds (irrespective of whether permanent
         residence has been achieved) the claimant must represent a  present
         threat to public policy.  The fact of a criminal conviction is  not
         enough.  It is not permissible in an EEA case to deport a  claimant
         on the basis of criminal offending simply to  deter  others.   This
         tends to mean, in the case of criminal  convictions  short  of  the
         most serious threats to the public safety  of  the  state,  that  a
         candidate for EEA deportation must represent a  present  threat  by
         reason of a propensity to reoffend or an unacceptably high risk  of
         offending.  In such cases,  if  there  is  acceptable  evidence  of
         rehabilitation, the prospects of future rehabilitation do not enter
         this balance, save for  possibly  a  future  protective  factor  to
         ensure the rehabilitation remains durable."

62. When applied to the circumstances of this case the risk of  reoffending
    is categorised as low and as stated earlier it is placed on  the  scale
    at 1% and whilst it is right  to  observe  that  by  itself  could  not
    exclude any risk of reoffending, given the risk placed at 1% it appears
    to be very low.  As  set  out  earlier  I  do  not  consider  that  the
    Appellant could properly be  described  as  having  a  "propensity"  to
    commit  such offences and it also cannot properly be said, based on the
    expert evidence before me, that there is an "unacceptably high" risk of
    the Appellant reoffending such as he would present a "genuine,  present
    and sufficiently serious threat".  That is the legal test  set  out  in
    Regulation 21(5)(c) and it has not been met in this case.

63. It is only if the threat is  made  out  on  the  evidence  that  it  is
    necessary to go on to address the ways in which the Secretary of  State
    weighed in the balance the considerations  set  out  Regulations  21(6)
    concerning whether the  removal  is  proportionate.   Even  if  it  was
    necessary to consider proportionality the following matters  appear  to
    me to be relevant.  I am satisfied that the Appellant has no social  or
    familial links to Germany.  His  history  and  chronology  demonstrates
    that he acquired citizenship on the basis of a previous marriage  to  a
    German national.  He had lived in the UK since his arrival in 2003  and
    there is no evidence he had ever returned to Germany during that  time,
    nor has he maintained any social or family links with that country.

64.  I would weigh in the balance that he had previously worked in  Germany
    and whilst his language skills are not said to be fluent, the  evidence
    before me is that he can speak and understand 50% of that language.   I
    could not find that he has no prospect of  re-establishing  his  social
    life but that has to be balanced against his length of residence in the
    United Kingdom and the family life he has established with his wife and
    daughters in the  United  Kingdom  in  terms  of  the  length  of  that
    residence and his integration in the UK.  In that regard  I  take  into
    account that he could not demonstrate a permanent right of residence as
    he had not produced evidence of exercise of treaty rights  during  that
    period of  time  and  whilst  that  counts  against  him  in  terms  of
    integration, there is evidence of him having studied during that period
    and given the length of time in the UK in the  period  of  over  eleven
    years, that establishes some level  of  integration  in  the  UK.   The
    Appellant was a man of previous good character who has committed a very
    serious offence, however the expert evidence demonstrates that there is
    a very small risk of reoffending and he has a family, all of  whom  are
    well-established in the United Kingdom.

65. In terms  of  proportionality  any  assessment  following  the  primary
    finding that Regulation 21(5)(c) is not met must have  the  consequence
    of the decision being disproportionate having found  that  his  removal
    has not been justified by the Respondent.

66.  The  public  policy  grounds  for  removal  is  an  exception  to  the
    fundamental principles of the free exercise of EU rights and as such an
    EU citizen should not be expelled as a deterrent to others without  the
    personal conduct of the person concerned giving rise to  consider  that
    he will commit other offences that are against the public policy of the
    state.  Furthermore it is accepted and acknowledged by  both  advocates
    that the appellant's deportation could not be justified simply  on  the
    basis of his previous criminal  conviction,  even  of  such  a  serious
    nature as the importation of class A drugs and the  imposition  of  the
    lengthy sentence he received. This is  because  the  legal  regime  for
    deporting EU criminals is different and can properly described as  more
    restrictive than that for  foreign  national  criminals  under  the  UK
    Borders Act 2007.  It must be established that the Appellant represents
    "a genuine, present or sufficiently serious threat affecting one of the
    fundamental interests of society".  In this context the future risk  of
    reoffending is considered in the light of his conduct and  it  has  not
    been established on the evidence before the Tribunal that the  test  is
    met under Regulation 21(5) (c).   Therefore  the  Appellant's  criminal
    conviction, whilst serious, cannot justify a decision to deport him  as
    an EU national on public policy grounds.

67. It is not necessary to consider Article 8 in the  light  of  the  above
    conclusions.

68. Consequently the appeal is allowed under the EEA Regulations 2006.
