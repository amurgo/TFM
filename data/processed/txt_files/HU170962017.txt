Representation:
For the appellant:     Mr M Jaufurally, instructed by Callistes Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr L Tarlow, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appellant's  appeal  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal  Judge  Clarke  promulgated  7.12.18,  dismissing  her  appeal
    against the decision of the Secretary  of  State,  dated  24.11.17,  to
    refuse her application made on 13.6.17 for entry clearance on the basis
    of family life with her  sponsoring  partner  settled  in  the  UK,  Mr
    Jonathan Francis Pagel, following their marriage in Jamaica on 8.4.17.

 2. The application was  refused  on  suitability  grounds,  the  appellant
    having pervious overstayed in the UK by  a  very  considerable  period.
    Further, the appellant failed  to  provide  with  the  application  all
    documents  required  under  the  specified  evidence  requirements   of
    Appendix FM-SE.

 3. Reliance was also made in the refusal decision on failure  to  pay  for
    NHS treatment but in the Entry Clearance Manager Review, this point was
    conceded by the respondent and was not relevant to the appeal, as Judge
    Clarke accepted.

 4. First-tier Tribunal Judge  Osborne  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    25.1.19, finding it arguable that the decision failed  to  address  the
    best  interests  of  the  relevant  child  and  also  failed  to   give
    consideration to GEN 3.2 of Appendix FM. Permission was granted on  all
    grounds raised in the application for permission to appeal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the decision of Judge Clarke should be set aside.

 6. It is common ground that the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  does
    not specifically address the best interests of the appellant's child by
    a previous  relationship  pursuant  to   Section  55  of  the  Borders,
    Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009. Mr Tarlow agreed  that  he  could
    not identify where that consideration had been made but submitted  that
    in the circumstances of the decision as a whole neither that issue  nor
    consideration of GEN 3.2 could have made any material difference to the
    outcome of the appeal.

Appendix FM-SE Specified Evidence

 7. It was Mr Jaufurally's submission that the sponsor's business  was  not
    one within the definition of  paragraph  9(a)  of  Appendix  FM-SE,  an
    argument advanced in the grounds. Judge Clarke dealt with this issue at
    [22] and [23] of the decision, considering paragraph  9,  finding  that
    the appellant's business was of a type defined in 9(a) and thus that he
    should have  submitted  with  the  application  dividend  vouchers,  as
    required in 9(d), but failed to do so.

 8. Mr Jaufurally's argument on this issue has no merit. He submitted  that
    as the sponsor held all the shares in the business and  there  were  no
    remaining shares held by fewer than five others, the business  did  not
    come within the definition of 9(a). This was  patently  wrong,  as  the
    requirement, inter alia, is for the person to  be  a  director  of  the
    company and for shares to be held  (directly  or  indirectly)  by  that
    person, their partner or one or more of the listed family members,  and
    that "any remaining shares" are held by fewer than  five  persons.  The
    use of the word "any" does not require the business to have shares held
    by others, it means that if there are any shares held  by  others  from
    than those in list of family members there must be no more than five of
    these others. It is nonsense to suggest that  the  definition  requires
    shares to be held by others.



Discretion under Appendix FM-SE

 9. In the alternative, Mr Jaufurally submitted that if  dividend  vouchers
    were in fact required, the Secretary of State should have  applied  its
    general discretion under  paragraph  D  of  Appendix  FM-SE  to  either
    disapply the requirement or to request the missing documents  from  the
    appellant and that the Secretary of State having failed to do  so,  the
    Judge should have exercised the discretion. However,  these  provisions
    explain  that  missing  documents  will  not  be  requested  where  the
    application is being refused for other  reasons  so  that  the  missing
    documents would have  made  no  material  difference.  As  the  refusal
    decision explained, the application was  also  refused  on  suitability
    grounds, the appellant having overstayed between 2011  and  2017,  when
    she returned to Jamaica. In the circumstances, there  is  no  merit  in
    this ground of appeal.

10. In the alternative, it was submitted in more general terms that as  the
    judge was satisfied at [21] of the decision that the  sponsor's  income
    exceeded the threshold of �18,600. However, the requirement is for  the
    requirements to be met at the date of the  application,  including  the
    specified evidence. There is no reason  why  the  appellant  should  be
    enabled to short-circuit the requirements of the Rules. The whole facts
    and circumstances were considered in  the  judge's  outside  the  Rules
    consideration and cogent  reasons  provided  for  finding  the  refusal
    decision proportionate. There is no merit in this ground of appeal.

11. The strongest point which the grounds raise in the  appellant's  favour
    is the omission of reference to the best interests of a relevant  child
    pursuant to Section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration  Act
    2009 and consideration of GEN 3.2 of Appendix FM.

12. The application at  paragraph  97  mentioned  that  the  appellant  was
    anxious to join the sponsor and her minor step-daughter in the  UK  "as
    we have  established  effective  family  life  together."The  child  in
    question is the sponsor's daughter from a previous relationship. I  was
    told that the child's mother now lives in the USA and that the  sponsor
    is the primary carer of this child. This is also mentioned at  [21]  of
    the sponsor's witness statement of 4.11.18, where it is explained  that
    the daughter moved in to live with the appellant  and  the  sponsor  in
    2016 and had allegedly established a special bond  with  the  appellant
    whilst she was in the UK until her  return  to  Jamaica  in  2017.  The
    period of cohabitation was therefore something less than two years.

13. However, it  is  far  from  clear  that  reliance  on  the  appellant's
    relationship with the sponsor's daughter was ever raised as an issue in
    the First-tier Tribunal appeal hearing. Mr  Jaufurally  was  unable  to
    confirm that it was and could only point to those brief  references  in
    the application form and the sponsor's witness statement set out above.
    It follows that there was no evidence before the  tribunal  as  to  the
    circumstances or strength of this relationship of  a  relatively  short
    duration. At [38] of the decision the judge commented that there was no
    qualifying child to  consider.  As  an  aside,  if  a  minor  child  is
    relevant, then the minimum income  threshold  may  well  be  more  than
    �18,600.

14. From the above, I am  satisfied  that  this  issue  of  a  relationship
    between the  appellant  and  a  step-child  was  not  raised  with  the
    tribunal. It is also obvious that had the best interests of  the  child
    been addressed, the tribunal would surely have found that they were  to
    remain with her father, whether that was in  the  UK  or  Jamaica.  The
    judge found that there were no insurmountable obstacles  to  continuing
    family life in Jamaica or  that  would  render  the  refusal  of  entry
    clearance unjustifiably harsh. Nothing in the evidence was presented to
    suggest that it would be unreasonable to expect the child to  accompany
    the sponsor to Jamaica if he decided to continue family life there with
    the appellant. The judge can hardly be criticised when this  issue  was
    never raised as a live issue in the  appeal  hearing  and  only  raise,
    rather in desperation, in the grounds of application for permission  to
    appeal to the Upper Tribunal.

15. Further, it is obvious that  the  relationship  with  the  sponsor  was
    entered into in entirely precarious circumstances and pursuant to R (on
    the applications of Agyarko and Ikuga) v Secretary  of  State  for  the
    Home Department [2017] UKSC 11 there would have to be  very  compelling
    circumstances, to,  exceptionally,  justify  granting  entry  clearance
    outside the  Rules.  The  judge  explained  that  the  decision  merely
    maintained the status quo and the sponsor could continue to financially
    support the appellant whilst she made a  fresh  application  for  entry
    clearance. GEN 3.2 adds nothing more to Agyarko in the circumstances.

16. On the facts of this case, I find that specific  consideration  to  the
    best interests of the appellant's step daughter could have added little
    to those matters raised in the First-tier Tribunal  appeal.  I  am  not
    satisfied that it would or could have made any material  difference  to
    the outcome of the appeal. In the  circumstances,  the  appeal  to  the
    Upper Tribunal cannot succeed.

Decision

17. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on  a  material  point  of  law  such  that  the
    decision should be set aside.

18. I make it clear that even if there was an error of  law  requiring  the
    decision to be set aside and remade in order to consider the impact  of
    the best interests of the child pursuant  to  s55,  on  the  facts  and
    circumstances I would have remade the decision by  dismissing  it  even
    after taking into account Section 55 of the  Borders,  Citizenship  and
    Immigration Act 2009 and GEN 3.2, for the reasons set out above.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order  pursuant  to  rule  13(1)  of  the  Tribunal
Procedure Rules 2014.

Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.



Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
pursuant to section 12(4)(a) of the Tribunals, Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed so there can be no fee award.
