                          (ANONYMITY ORDER NOT MADE)
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria born on 29th December 1969.  He
       applied to remain in the UK as the extended  family  member  (durable
       partner) of Ms Niatta Tucker, a  Norwegian  national  exercising  EEA
       rights in the UK. His appeal against the decision was  dismissed  for
       want of jurisdiction by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Rothwell  in  a
       determination promulgated on the 13th July 2017.

    2. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal
       Foudy on the basis that it was arguable that the First-tier judge had
       erred in law in deciding that there was no jurisdiction to  hear  the
       appeal in light of the decision in Khan v Secretary of State for  the
       Home Department [2017] EWCA Civ 1755.

    3. I issued a direction on 3rd January 2018 stating that an error of law
       would be found, and the matter remitted to the First-tier Tribunal if
       no objections were sent within 7 days. The direction was sent out  on
       4th January 2018 by first class post to both parties.  No  objections
       have been received and so I make the decision set out below.


    Decision:


      1. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved  the
         making of an error on a point of law.


      2. I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal that there  was
         no jurisdiction to hear this appeal.


      3. I remit the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal for remaking.
