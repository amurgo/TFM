                                                                  And


                                                                  Respondent





                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1. The appellant, the Entry Clearance Officer,  Tehran,  has  appealed  with
leave of the Tribunal against a determination  of  Adjudicator,  Mrs  Kamini
Roopnarine-Dawes, notified on  8  June  2004  allowing  the  appeal  of  the
respondent, a national of Iran, against the  decision  to  refuse  to  grant
entry clearance as a family visitor. Ms T  Lewsey,  Home  Office  Presenting
Officer, appeared for the  appellant.  There  was  no  appearance  from  the
sponsor or anyone  representing  the  respondent.  To  avoid  confusion  the
respondent is hereafter referred to as the "claimant".


2. The Adjudicator allowed the appeal  because  she  was  satisfied  on  the
further evidence before her, which included  credible  oral  testimony  from
the sponsor, that the sponsor's financial circumstances were sound and  that
the claimant's socio-economic situation viewed overall did  not  demonstrate
an incentive to return.

3. The grounds of appeal challenged this conclusion on the strength  of  the
fact that the  claimant's  sponsor  had  said  in  oral  evidence  that  she
intended to give the claimant �100 a week  while  she  was  here  as  pocket
money. By reference to the case of Gomez [2002]  UKIAT  06231,  the  grounds
contended that the Adjudicator had misinterpreted case  law  and  failed  to
apply the definition of "employment" given at para 41 of HC395.

4. When it was clear that the sponsor was  neither  in  attendance  nor  any
representative, we caused a phone call to be made to her. We felt  it  right
to take that step because from the file we  could  see  she  had  previously
taken a very active interest in the appeal process. We  were  told  she  was
unaware that a notice of hearing had been  sent  for  today  and  understood
that her husband  had  instructed  solicitors  in  relation  to  any  appeal
hearing. In the event we did not find it necessary to adjourn,  since  there
was no challenge as to the credibility of  the  sponsor  (as  found  by  the
Adjudicator) and the legal issue was in our view a  relatively  simple  one.
This constitutes our reason for  deciding  to  exercise  our  discretion  to
proceed to hear the appeal in the absence of one of the parties.

5. We were not persuaded that the grounds of appeal in this  case  are  made
out. It is clear that the Adjudicator had before  her  the  case  of  Gomez.
That turned largely on its own facts.  If  there  is  any  principle  to  be
extracted from this case, it is that whether or not a sum to be  paid  to  a
visitor by a sponsor constitutes remuneration or pocket money  is  a  matter
of fact to be decided in each case.

6. We see nothing  to  suggest  that  the  Adjudicator  failed  to  consider
whether the �100 sum mentioned by the sponsor in this case was  remuneration
rather than pocket money. At para 16 she stated:

      "The fact that as an older sister she  chooses  to  give  her  younger
      sister pocket money whilst she is here should not be viewed as payment
      but  rather  in  the  culture  of  an  extended  family  such  as  the
      appellant's as a demonstration of affection and I so find as  a  fact.
      The sponsor confirmed at the hearing that she would give this  sum  to
      her sister whether or not she helped to look after her father in  law.
      It seems to me an inappropriate strain on the ordinary meaning of  the
      word to say that the appellant will be employed by the sponsor".


7. From the above it is perfectly  clear  that  the  Adjudicator  considered
whether the proposed �100  payment  would  amount  to  remuneration  in  the
course of employment. She gave perfectly proper reasons for concluding  that
it would not. On the evidence before the Adjudicator the findings  she  made
were ones entirely open to her.

8. Para 41 lists among the requirements to be met by a person seeking  leave
to enter the United Kingdom as a visitor that he:

      "(iii) does not intend to take employment in the United Kingdom".

9. A further requirement is that he:

      (vi)  will  maintain  and  accommodate  himself  and  any   dependants
      adequately out of resources  available  to  him  without  recourse  to
      public funds or taking employment; or will, with  any  dependants,  be
      maintained   and   accommodated    adequately    by    relatives    or
      friends:..."(emphasis added).

10. We would confirm the proposition set out earlier. Whether or not  a  sum
to be paid to a visitor by a  sponsor  constitutes  remuneration  or  pocket
money as a form of maintenance is a matter of fact to  be  decided  in  each
case. What is meant by any reference to "pocket money" will  likewise  be  a
matter to be examined in each case. The fact that the  sum  in  question  is
greater or lesser than the sum of �80 (as in Gomez)  or  �100  (as  in  this
case) tells the decision-taker little  in  itself.  For  a  person  from  an
affluent background visiting a millionaire sponsor,  a  much  larger  amount
might still  constitute  "pocket  money".  Equally,  for  a  person  from  a
penurious background visiting  a  sponsor  of  meagre  means,  even  a  much
smaller sum may indicate that something other  than  "pocket  money"  is  in
contemplation. But in this particular  case,  the  sum  proposed  was  quite
consistent with the evidence accepted by the Adjudicator that the  financial
means of both the sponsor and the claimant`s father were  healthy  and  that
nothing other than pocket money was contemplated.

11.  Had we been a first instance  tribunal  we  may  not  necessarily  have
taken the same view. We would certainly have seen  it  as  necessary  to  do
more than this Adjudicator did when it came to  giving  proper  reasons  for
finding a witness credible: she simply stated she found  her  credible.  But
we cannot interfere in this decision unless satisfied it is legally  flawed.
It is not.

12. For the above reasons the appeal of the Secretary of State is  dismissed
and the determination of the Adjudicator stands.
