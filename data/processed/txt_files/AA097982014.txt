For the claimant: Mr N Paramjorthy, instructed by A&P Solicitors
For the appellant:     Mr S Whitwell, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge  Barber  promulgated  21.1.15,  allowing,  on
    asylum and human rights grounds,  the  claimant's  appeal  against  the
    decisions of the respondent, dated  30.10.14,  to  refuse  his  asylum,
    humanitarian protection and human rights claims, and to remove him from
    the UK by way of directions under section 47 of the Immigration  Asylum
    and Nationality Act 2006.  The Judge heard the appeal on 6.1.15.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge Wellesley-Cole granted permission  to  appeal
    on 5.2.15.

 3. Thus the matter came before me on 10.4.15 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 4. For the reasons set out herein, I find that there was no material error
    of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  such
    that the determination of Judge Barber should be set aside.

 5. The single ground of application assert that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge made a material error of law at �35 of the decision by  departing
    from the risk factors set out in the country guidance case  of  GJ  and
    others (Post civil war) Sri Lanka  CG  [2013]  UKUT  00319.  The  judge
    stated that the claimant is not on a stop list or one of the categories
    of persons coming within paragraph 7 of GJ, yet in the  same  paragraph
    the judge held, "Given his activities in the diaspora it seems to me  a
    real risk that he may well be detained for questioning where his  scars
    may become apparent thus creating further interest in him."

 6. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Wellesley-Cole observed, "As GJ
    is a country guidance case, the findings in paragraph 35 do  appear  to
    be contradictory because the judge firstly held he did not come  within
    Category 7(a) and yet gives his  activities  in  the  diaspora  as  the
    reason for possible detention. As he may have departed from GJ  he  may
    have fallen into error in this respect."

 7. Whilst there is an apparent inconsistency in the statements in  �35,  I
    am satisfied that  the  judge  provided  cogent  reasons  open  on  the
    evidence to justify the conclusion that on the facts of this case there
    remains a real risk of ill-treatment or harm to  justify  allowing  the
    asylum, humanitarian protection and human rights claims.

 8. The judge accepted the claimant's case in its entirety. It was accepted
    that:

      a) He has been arrested and detained;

      b) He had been mistreated and tortured by the Sri Lankan  authorities,
         resulting in scaring;

      c) There had been 2 post-conflict searches, in 2011 and 2014;

      d) He had engaged in diaspora activities, attending demonstrations  in
         the UK.

 9. At �34 the judge referred to paragraph 339K of the  Immigration  Rules,
    which provides that "the fact that a person has already been subject to
    persecution or serious harm, or to direct threats of  such  persecution
    or such harm, will be regarded as a serious indication of the  person's
    well-founded fear of persecution or  real  risk  of  suffering  serious
    harm, unless there are good reasons to consider that  such  persecution
    or serious harm will not be repeated." The judge found that there was a
    real risk of ill-treatment or harm on return and  set  out  reasons  in
    �35, the sole source of complaint by the Secretary of State.

10. In his submissions, Mr Whitwell suggested that the judge was  referring
    to (7)(a) of GJ. In fact, the judge did not state (7)(a), only (7).  Mr
    Paramjorthy suggested that it is most likely that the judge was in fact
    referring to (7)(d) of GJ, and when  read  in  that  light,  �35  makes
    perfect sense. (7)(d) relates to those on a  computerised  'stop'  list
    accessible at the airport, of those against whom  there  is  an  extant
    court order or arrest warrant.

11. It is not clear to me whether that is what the judge intended to state,
    as the paragraph refers to a category of persons within (7) of  GJ.  In
    any event, even if the Secretary of State is  right  and  there  is  an
    inconsistency in that paragraph  it  cannot  be  a  material  error  as
    pursuant to 339K, the judge has found that the  claimant  had  suffered
    serious ill-treatment and this was thus a serious indicator of a  well-
    founded fear of persecution or a real risk of suffering  serious  harm.
    No good reasons to the contrary have been identified from the  decision
    or the evidence by the Secretary of State.

12. The judge may well have found that the diaspora activities were not, by
    themselves, sufficient to amount to a significant role in post-conflict
    Tamil separatism, given that there were only two  events  he  attended.
    However, when added to the fact that he has already been  subjected  to
    ill-treatment including torture by the Sri Lankan authorities, and that
    he bears the marks of scaring, I find that it was open to the judge  to
    conclude that there was a real risk of persecution and of serious harm,
    for which cogent reasons have been provided.

13. Further, at �37 the judge was also satisfied that if  returned  to  Sri
    Lanka the claimant would face a real risk of suffering treatment  which
    would breach the UK's article 3 ECHR obligation.

14. In the  circumstances,  it  is  inevitable  on  the  factual  findings,
    regardless of the apparent inconsistency in �35,  that  the  claimant's
    appeal would have to be allowed.

Conclusions:

15. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains allowed on all grounds as  found  by  the
                    judge.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.

Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.

Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: No fee is payable and thus there can be no fee award.
