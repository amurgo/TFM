Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms B Asanovic, of Counsel instructed by Selvarajah &
Co
For the Respondent:    Mr C Avery, a Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant, a citizen of the Philippines, born on [ ] 2000,  appeals
    with permission against a decision of Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal
    Hosie who in a determination promulgated on 29 September dismissed  her
    appeal against a decision of the Entry Clearance  Officer,  Manila,  to
    refuse her entry clearance to join her father,  [Mr  R  G],  a  British
    citizen, in Britain.

2.   It is useful in this case to set out the  relevant  family  tree.   The
    appellant's great grandparents had four daughters, Lolita  who  is  the
    mother of the sponsor, the appellant's father; Violetta whose  daughter
    is the mother of the appellant (the appellant's parents  are  therefore
    cousins); Emilia and Carmen.  The claim is that the appellant's parents
    had a brief relationship when the sponsor was aged 16 and  that  before
    the appellant was born the sponsor had joined his mother in Britain  as
    her dependent child.  It is claimed that when the  appellant  was  born
    her mother, who was aged 15, had wanted to have nothing to do with  the
    appellant and abandoned her, the appellant  being  brought  up  by  her
    mother's sister, Carmen.   However  the  sponsor  claims  that  he  had
    married the appellant's mother in 2003 in order to give the appellant a
    family life but, on realising that she only wanted to come  to  Britain
    rather than to start a family life  with  him  and  the  appellant  the
    marriage was later annulled: this was an action taken under the law  of
    the Philippines which does not allow marriage between cousins.

3.   It was the evidence of the sponsor that he had initially given �150  to
    �200 per month to his mother to send money to her sister Carmen for the
    upkeep of the appellant and that now �200 to �300 per  month  is  being
    sent.  Only one payment at a time was made to  Carmen  was  made  which
    would include money for food, books,  uniform  and  anything  that  the
    appellant needed at school but some money also went on  medication  for
    Carmen.  The sponsor also said that he paid for private  schooling  for
    the appellant and that he communicated with  her  on  Facebook  and  by
    telephone daily, discussing  her  behaviour,  her  studies  and  family
    values with her.  He said that he was engaged  in  decisions  regarding
    her hobbies, class choices, school trips and so on.  He had visited the
    appellant in 2003, 2007, 2010, 2011 and 2015.

4.   The appellant produced money transfers showing money sent in  his  name
    from 2014 and 2015.

5.   The appellant's mother Lolita gave evidence confirming  that  she  sent
    money to the Philippines which included money from  the  sponsor.   The
    appellant was now living  with  Emilia.   She  asserted  there  was  no
    contact from the appellant's birth mother's family and  that  they  had
    had no contact with her since birth.  Lolita stated  that  she  visited
    the Philippines every year for four  weeks'  holiday.   She  said  that
    Emilia and Carmen lived together.

6.   It was the respondent's contention that the sponsor had not shown  that
    he exercised sole responsibility in daily decision making  and  control
    of the appellant - there was no evidence of a Facebook account although
    there were numerous telephone cards provided.  The contact number given
    at the appellant's school was for Emilia although  the  sponsor's  name
    was detailed in the registration form.  It  was  not  accepted  by  the
    respondent that the appellant's mother had not been in contact with her
    since her birth.  The contacts number given on the appellant's ID  card
    gives an emergency contact number  for  Mr  and  Mrs  De  Guzman.   The
    sponsor said that it was his aunt's telephone number.  His mother  said
    that it was the mother of Emilia.  The  respondent  said  it  was  more
    plausible that it was the appellant's mother's number.

7.   The judge, having referred to the determination of the Tribunal  in  TD
    (paragraph 297(i)(e); sole responsibility) Yemen [2006]  UKAIT  49  set
    out her findings and  conclusions  at  paragraphs  19  onwards  of  the
    determination.  She noted that paternity was not  disputed  and  stated
    that the relevant issue was that of whether or not the sponsor had sole
    responsibility for the appellant.  She considered there were  a  number
    of anomalies in the evidence before her: she referred to  a  note  from
    the appellant's mother, which had been notarised in the  same  town  as
    the where the appellant was living, which said that she  had  entrusted
    the care of the appellant to her aunt Emilia and that she gave  consent
    for her daughter to travel to Britain. The judge stated that given  the
    proximity of the appellant's mother it was unlikely that there  was  no
    contact or had been no contact for ten years and no one knew where  the
    appellant's mother was.  Taking into account that the letter  had  been
    obtained from a close relative who lived nearby that was considered  to
    be improbable.  She went on to state  that  she  was  troubled  by  the
    reference in the refusal letter to the ECO having  had  sights  of  the
    appellant's parents' marriage certificate which was not  in  the  court
    papers.  It was stated in the refusal letter that the parents, that  is
    the sponsor and the appellant's mother had been married at the time  of
    the appellant's birth in June 2000 and  the  marriage  had  since  been
    annulled.  She stated that this did not tie in with the sponsor's claim
    that he had been in Britain and not known that his cousin was pregnant.
     She noted the sponsor's  evidence  that  they  had  married  in  2003.
    However the appellant had claimed that her mother had left  to  go  and
    work in Bahrain when she was about 1 year old and that since that  time
    the appellant had lived with her aunt Emilia. The sponsor  had  however
    stated that the appellant had lived with her aunt  Emilia  from  birth.
    The judge stated that it was difficult to reconcile  these  assertions.
    She said that she could not be certain, to the required standard,  that
    the appellant's mother had been entirely absent from her life and  that
    in turn made it more  difficult  for  the  sponsor  to  establish  sole
    responsibility.

8.   Turning to the other available evidence she noted that  there  were  no
    correspondence or school reports which had been provided.  Although she
    took into account the international telephone calling cards  which  had
    been produced it was stated that these did not necessarily  prove  that
    the appellant had been the subject  of  all  the  international  calls.
    There had been no evidence which provided a Facebook  or  social  media
    contact.  She did not accept that there was any hard evidence  to  show
    that the mother had totally abdicated her role and had had  no  contact
    whatever with the appellant.

9.   Although she accepted that there was some financial  support  from  the
    sponsor to the appellant and that there was genuine love and  affection
    between them the judge took the view that there was no direct  evidence
    apart from the sponsor's assertions that he  was  providing  day-to-day
    direction on important matters to the appellant.  At  most,  the  judge
    stated there was shared responsibility with the appellant's great  aunt
    Emilia.  Her conclusion was that "the appellant would  appear  to  have
    been brought up by her mother's family in the Philippines".  She stated
    that she was not  satisfied  that  the  sponsor  had  established  sole
    responsibility for his daughter.  Having considered the  provisions  of
    Section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and  Immigration  Act  2009  and
    having noted the fact that the appellant had been  brought  up  in  the
    Philippines, the judge found that the decision was not a breach of  her
    rights under Article 8 of the ECHR.

10.  The grounds of appeal argued that the judge had not  taken  account  of
    all the evidence before her and stated it was unclear why the judge had
    not accepted the evidence of the sponsor and his mother that they  were
    unaware of the whereabouts of the appellant's mother and had  to  trace
    her through a relative.  They stated there were no specific reasons for
    rejecting that assertion.  Moreover it was argued that  the  judge  had
    been wrong to place weight on the assertion that the appellant's mother
    had travelled to Bahrain when the appellant was 1 year old.  It was the
    evidence that the sponsor and she had later married and it  was  stated
    that the judge had not properly considered the sponsor's explanation.

11.  Weight was placed on the fact that the judge had referred to not  being
    certain that the required burden of proof had been met and the decision
    of the judge that the sponsor  and  the  appellant's  great  aunt  were
    exercising shared responsibility did not suggest that there was  shared
    responsibility between the appellant's  mother,  the  sponsor  and  the
    great aunt.  The grounds referred to the oral evidence of  the  sponsor
    and stated the judge should have taken that  into  account  and  should
    have been able to make  positive  credibility  findings  thereon.   The
    grounds quarrelled  with  the  assertion  of  the  judge  that  it  was
    difficult to see how the sponsor could have made all the  decisions  in
    the appellant's life when she was a young child and he  himself  was  a
    young adult.

12.  The grounds went on to say that it is important for a  young  child  to
    live with her parent in Britain and it was asserted that  the  evidence
    had been that she had been abandoned soon after birth and she had  been
    brought up and cared for by the sponsor.  It was also asserted that the
    decision under Article 8 was wrong in law.

13.  At the hearing of  the  appeal  before  me  Ms  Asanovic  relied  on  a
    skeleton argument which referred to the grounds of appeal  and  to  the
    relevant test set out in the determination in TD (Yemen) which was that
    "the test is whether the parent is  continuing  control  and  direction
    over  the  child's  upbringing,  including  making  all  the  important
    decisions in the child's  life"  and  stated  that  that  was  a  fact-
    sensitive issue.  It was argued that  the  judge  had  not  make  clear
    findings of the credibility of the witnesses and had not said  why  the
    sponsor's evidence and that of  his  mother  had  been  rejected.   The
    conclusion that either the appellant's mother lived nearby or that  the
    letter had been falsely notarised was criticised: it  was  stated  that
    the appellant's mother could not be located.    Ms Asanovic argued that
    the fact that the appellant's mother might have  a  registered  address
    near that of her sisters did not mean  that  that  was  where  she  was
    living or that she was not living abroad.  It was stated that there was
    clear evidence that the mother  had  wanted  nothing  to  do  with  the
    appellant.

14.  It was also argued that the findings of  the  judge  were  unclear  and
    that she had taken into account  matters  which  were  not  before  her
    particularly with regards to the marriage of the appellant's father and
    mother in 2003.  It was stated the judge should not have placed  weight
    on the letter from the appellant's mother which said that the appellant
    had been left in the care of her  great  aunt,  Emilia.   It  was  also
    argued that the judge was not entitled to state that it  was  difficult
    to see in what way the sponsor  had  made  all  the  decisions  in  the
    appellant's life when she was a young child and he himself was a  young
    adult trying to establish himself in another country.

15.  Finally with regard to the  issue  of  the  Article  8  rights  of  the
    appellant it was argued that there was no requirement under  Article  8
    for sole responsibility and that, absent  exceptional  factors,  family
    life between the parent and child should continue to exist.   Voluntary
    separation did not end family life.  It was argued  that  the  decision
    was disproportionate.

16.  In her oral submissions Ms Asanovic referred to  the  letter  from  the
    appellant's mother and stated that there was nothing to suggest that it
    had been falsely notarised or was not genuine but in any event  it  did
    not indicate that the  appellant's  mother  was  living  close  to  the
    appellant and her sister.  Moreover there was nothing to  suggest  that
    the assertions relating to the departure of the appellant's mother  and
    the marriage were irreconcilable.  There was nothing to  indicate  that
    the assertion of the respondent that the appellant's parents  had  been
    married at the time of the birth but in any event the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer was not relying on that.  The fact that the appellant's  mother
    may have been around until  the  appellant  was  1  year  old  did  not
    undermine the issue  of  sole  responsibility.   She  referred  to  the
    appellant's bundle including the affidavit from the  appellant's  great
    aunt, Emilia and argued that clear findings had not been made.

17.  In reply Mr Avery asked me to take into account  the  context  of  this
    case in the terms of the letter of refusal.  He argued that  the  judge
    had properly  considered  all  the  evidence  before  her  and  reached
    conclusions which were again fully open to her.  She  was  entitled  to
    take the view that the sponsor had not  exercised  sole  responsibility
    for the appellant.  He stated that the conclusions of  the  judge  with
    regard to the appellant's Article 8 rights were entirely appropriate.

Discussion

18.  I consider that there is no material error of law in the  determination
    of the First-tier Tribunal.  There were considerable anomalies  in  the
    evidence which I consider were properly dealt with by the  judge.   Not
    only was there some conflict regarding the date of  marriage  and  also
    the issue of when the appellant's mother had left to go to Bahrain  but
    the ages of the sponsor and of the appellant's mother were issues which
    themselves gave rise to further matters of concern.   I  consider  that
    the judge was entirely right to note  that  on  his  own  evidence  the
    sponsor had come to Britain at the age of 16 when he  asserts  that  he
    did not know that his cousin was pregnant and it is very  difficult  to
    accept   that  thereafter  he  was  sending  money  to  the  appellant.
    Moreover the circumstances  surrounding  the  marriage  are  surprising
    given the documentary evidence which was  before  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer which indicated that the appellant's parents  were  married  at
    the time of the appellant's birth (although clearly that  is  difficult
    to accept giving the young age of both her parents) and  the  assertion
    that they were married in 2003 and that shortly thereafter the marriage
    was annulled.  The sponsor should have been able to produce documentary
    evidence to show the date of marriage and the date  of  the  annulment.
    Moreover there is a paucity of  evidence  that  the  sponsor  has  been
    exercising sole responsibility for the appellant who  has,  of  course,
    always lived with her aunt Emilia in the Philippines.  There  are,  for
    example, no letters from  the  school  or  evidence  of  communications
    between the appellant and the sponsor showing  that  he  is  exercising
    control over her education and upbringing.  The judge did weigh up  the
    evidence before her and I consider that she reached  conclusions  which
    were fully open to her thereon.  The reality is that  the  sponsor  has
    seen very little of the appellant  over  the  years  only  managing  to
    travel to the Philippines every three or four years at most.   I  would
    add that the judge's scepticism regarding the virtual disappearance  of
    the appellant's mother was fully justified and indeed she was  entitled
    to place weight on the fact that the notarised  letter  indicated  that
    the appellant's mother was living not  far  from  where  the  appellant
    lives.  Even if I were to  accept  Ms  Asanovic's  assertion  that  the
    address given for the attorney did not prove that the mother living  in
    the   Philippines that was a conclusion which was indeed  open  to  the
    judge to make.

19.  There is a paucity of evidence to show the involvement of  the  sponsor
    with the appellant's life and the evidence from the  appellant's  great
    aunt does not assist.  Although her statement, which corroborates  that
    of the sponsor, states that the family  having  been  informed  that  a
    letter from the appellant's mother would need to be obtained  and  that
    the appellant's great aunt Emilia had contacted one of the  appellant's
    mother's relatives who had lived in the area  to  get  the  letter  the
    claim that it was unknown why the appellant's mother did  not  put  her
    own address on the letter and that no one knew  where  the  appellant's
    mother lived, was a  claim  of  which  the  judge  was  rightly  to  be
    sceptical.

20.  While I accept that it is the case that the judge  did  not  state,  in
    terms, that she did not believe that the evidence of  the  sponsor  and
    his mother and indeed what was written in the appellant's great  aunt's
    statement, the reality is that she did weigh up the evidence before and
    came to conclusions which were fully open to her.  That conclusion  was
    that the  sponsor  was  not  exercising  sole  responsibility  for  the
    appellant.

21.  I consider that the judge did consider all relevant  matters  and  that
    her decision is in no way perverse.  I therefore find that her decision
    dismissing this appeal on immigration grounds shall stand.

22.  Moreover, given the fact that the appellant and sponsor have only  very
    briefly spent time together during the appellant's  lifetime  and  that
    there was nothing to show that the appellant  is  living  in  difficult
    circumstances  in  the  Philippines,  I  consider  that   the   judge's
    conclusions relating to the Article 8  rights  of  the  appellant  were
    fully open to her.

23.    I therefore conclude that there is no material error of  law  in  the
    determination and that the decision of the judge to dismiss this appeal
    on a immigration and human rights grounds should stand.

Notice of Decision

The appeal is dismissed on immigration and human rights grounds.

Upper Tribunal Judge McGeachy                7.6.2016
