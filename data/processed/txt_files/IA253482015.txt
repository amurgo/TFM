For the Respondent:    Mr T Melvin, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Background

      1. The appellant is a Pakistani national and was born  on  8  November
         1971. She entered the UK on 30 October 2000 as a  Tier  4  migrant.
         With the absence of gaps in her residence between 4  December  2004
         and 17 May 2005, and 30 September 2008 and November 2009  when  her
         applications were  refused,  she  had  leave  to  remain  until  30
         November 2009. Her application for indefinite leave to  remain  was
         refused on 14 January 2010 and appeal dismissed on 4  May  2010  by
         First-tier Tribunal Judge  Baldwin.  Another  application  made  on
         article 8 grounds in April 2013, was refused  on  29  May  2013.  A
         third application made on 26 May 2015 was refused on 9  July  2015.
         That led to an appeal hearing before  Judge  Majid  on  7  December
         2016. The judge allowed the appeal on 10 February 2017, but it  was
         set aside  by  Deputy  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Norton-Taylor  on  9
         November 2017 because of an absence of reasoning. The  matter  then
         came  before  Judge  Ross  who  allowed   the   appeal,   but   his
         determination has been in the most part set aside  by  my  decision
         dated 13 September 2018 following a challenge by the respondent and
         a hearing before me at Field House.


      2. I preserved the following findings made by  Judge  Ross:  that  the
         relationship  is  genuine  and  subsisting,  that  the  appellant's
         husband has lived here since 2003 and is a British  national,  that
         he is a pastor and has a business, that the couple  have  undergone
         unsuccessful IVF treatment, that the appellant and her husband  are
         involved in  the  Christian  community  in  the  UK  and  that  the
         appellant's mother and brother remain in Pakistan. The  appellant's
         immigration history is also not in dispute.
The hearing


      3. The appellant and her husband both attended the  hearing  and  gave
         oral evidence.  At  the  commencement  of  the  hearing,  Mr  Ahmed
         clarified that he would be pursuing three lines of  argument:  that
         the appellant qualified for leave under  (1)  EX.1,  (2)  paragraph
         276ADE because in October 2019 she will have been for twenty years,
         and (3) article 8 grounds.


      4. The appellant gave evidence first. She adopted her earlier  witness
         statement and confirmed her current address. She  stated  that  she
         had married in 2016; there had been no other kind of marriage.  She
         was referred to the claim of a customary marriage  and  she  stated
         that she had meant that her husband had gone to  Pakistan  to  seek
         permission for the marriage from her mother and brother. There  was
         no ceremony; her husband and his  family  accompanied  him  and  an
         agreement was signed. She did not have it with her.


      5. The appellant was asked about the fresh evidence she  had  adduced.
         She stated that it pertained to IVF treatment that had been done on
         13 November 2018. She  would  now  be  under  observation  for  3-4
         months. Due to her age and the presence  of  fibroids  outside  her
         uterus, she was at  risk  of  miscarriage.  If  the  treatment  was
         unsuccessful, she would be allowed another attempt. In total  there
         could be  three  cycles.  The  appellant  confirmed  that  she  had
         undergone IVF treatment in 2009. She had then waited before  trying
         again because she wanted to resolve her  immigration  status.  Then
         she saw a doctor and was advised  to  have  the  treatment  quickly
         because of the fibroids. That completed examination-in-chief.


      6. In response to Mr Melvin's questions, the appellant stated that she
         had met her husband in 2008 and they became a couple and started to
         live together in April  2009.  They  waited  until  2016  to  marry
         because although she was given a Talaq divorce in 2009, it was  not
         accepted when they approached the local  council  with  a  view  to
         marry in 2015. They waited until 2015 because the appellant's  main
         focus was her immigration status. They had thought of returning  to
         Pakistan and marrying there in the presence of their  families  but
         her application for leave was refused and so she had to keep making
         further applications. The appellant  was  asked  why  she  had  not
         returned to Pakistan to make an entry  clearance  application.  She
         stated that was because she faced hurdles. She had been married  to
         a Muslim in 2004. He returned to Pakistan  and  she  faced  threats
         because his family wanted  her  to  convert  from  Christianity  to
         Islam. She stated they had not asked the family for  permission  to
         marry. She stated she had been advised to claim asylum by the  Home
         Office but she had said she did not "deserve" it and that she was a
         student which was completely  different.  She  did  not  return  to
         Pakistan because she was very afraid. She  had  previously  visited
         Pakistan many times until 2009 without problems  but  she  had  not
         stayed with her in-laws. When asked what had changed, she said  her
         ex-husband had said he "would come  for  me".  Although  they  were
         divorced, she said that he  could  still  threaten  her  and  as  a
         Christian  she  would  have  problems.    She   stated   that   her
         representative had told her she was not an overstayer  because  she
         had applications pending. She  considered  she  had  the  right  to
         remain under the ten year route.


      7. The appellant stated that her husband had obtained indefinite leave
         to remain in 2014. She had not married him then  and  sought  entry
         clearance as a spouse because his father died. She then stated that
         he had passed away in 2012.


      8. The appellant clarified  that  the  IVF  cycles  were  every  three
         months.


      9. In re-examination the appellant clarified that  the  cycles  lasted
         three months with a one-month wait in between.


     10. In response to my  questions,  the  appellant  said  that  she  had
         changed her mind about waiting  for  IVF  until  after  surgery  to
         remove the fibroids because there may have been complications.  She
         stated that there were small fibroids within the uterus but a large
         one outside  it.  The  first  IVF  treatment  had  taken  place  in
         September or October 2009. When asked why she had needed  treatment
         so soon after she had commenced cohabitation with her husband,  she
         explained it was because she wanted children so much. She had  made
         no visits to Pakistan after 2007. Her husband had been in 2004  and
         then in 2014. He had three sisters and a brother in Pakistan;  they
         were married with children. The appellant said she  had  last  been
         threatened by her husband in 2010. He had sent  her  text  messages
         after leaving and had said: "when you come here, I'll see to  you".
         Whether asked why he had been angry with her,  the  appellant  said
         that his behaviour had changed. She did not know why.  He  had  not
         told her about his first marriage and she had found out.


     11. Mr Melvin had questions arising. He asked whether  the  appellant's
         first husband had entered  the  UK  as  a  Tier  4  dependant.  She
         confirmed he had. She  agreed  that  after  she  had  been  refused
         indefinite leave to remain, the marriage became difficult.  He  had
         no basis to stay so he left. She did not know if that had made  him
         angry.


     12. Mr Ahmed also had further questions to put. The appellant said  she
         and her husband had tried to conceive a child  naturally  but  only
         for a short time. She was 38 when she had one cycle  in  2009.  She
         said she could have made an entry  clearance  application  but  the
         situation was worse now after the Asia Bibi case. She had also been
         making  previous  applications  for  leave  and  did  not  want  to
         disrespect the Tribunal by not filing an appeal. There was no other
         reason she could not return and make an application. She then  said
         her husband relied on her. They had a strong bond. Mr  Ahmed  asked
         if there were any other reasons. The appellant stated she  did  not
         know how long she would have to wait  for  the  application  to  be
         decided. It  would  be  difficult  for  her  without  her  husband.
         Moreover, her mother lived with her brother who had  five  children
         and he did not have a large house. People would know she came  from
         England. Mr Ahmed asked the appellant again whether there were  any
         other reasons. She replied that there were none. That completed the
         appellant's evidence.


     13. I then heard from [DS], the appellant's husband. He  confirmed  his
         address and adopted his statement. He stated that he had  paid  for
         the IVF treatment. It cost �7000. The next procedure would be blood
         tests and then a scan as the appellant was under observation.  This
         was the only clinic that would treat her. She could have a total of
         three cycles.


     14. The witness stated that if the appellant had to go to Pakistan  and
         seek entry clearance, he would have to take time off work and as he
         was on a zero hours contract, he would not be paid.  Moreover,  the
         standard of treatment  there  would  be  different.  He  was  asked
         whether he would receive a refund if the appellant did not have the
         additional cycles. He said that he would not. When  I  pointed  out
         that he had not yet paid �7000, he agreed he had not.


     15.  In  cross-examination,  the  witness  confirmed  he  had  met  the
         appellant in 2008. They began a relationship and  started  to  live
         together in 2008/2009. It was around the  time  her  visa  expired.
         They commenced the IVF course  soon  afterwards  because  they  had
         tried for a baby but had not succeeded.  He  had  been  on  a  work
         permit at that time. He  denied  that  the  IVF  treatment  was  to
         enhance the appellant's chances of a successful claim. He said that
         there had been a gap of ten years in IVF treatment because  of  the
         appellant's status.


     16. The witness confirmed that he  had  obtained  indefinite  leave  to
         remain in 2014. They waited until 2016  to  marry  because  of  the
         appellant's status.  They had to apply  to  the  Home  Office.  She
         could not go to Pakistan to make  an  entry  clearance  application
         because her brother did not have a big house and  because  she  was
         waiting for her status to be resolved.  When  asked  what  prompted
         them to marry in 2016, the witness stated it was because they loved
         each other. He had last been to Pakistan in 2015 for a family visit
         and also to ask the appellant's brother  for  permission  to  marry
         her. He stayed for four weeks. He visited his own  family  too.  He
         had a document relating to the permission to marry which he  stated
         had been submitted. He stated they could have gone to Pakistan  and
         she could have made an entry clearance application but they did not
         know how long it would take. Additionally, they wanted children and
         she also helped him with work and cooked and cleaned and washed for
         him. He stated that he had to wait ten years for the  next  attempt
         at IVF because he had to save the money. If the  appellant  had  to
         make an entry clearance application, there would be the fee to  pay
         and the costs  of  the  accommodation.  They  had  never  made  any
         enquiries as to the time factor involved.  He  was  not  trying  to
         frustrate the process by litigation. He called one clinic in Lahore
         about IVF but they told him it would not be of the same standard as
         the treatment in the UK. He stated that  he  had  experienced  some
         problems on his return to Pakistan but had not referred to these in
         his statement because this was not an asylum appeal. He  said  that
         the appellant would not make an asylum application if  this  appeal
         failed. He said no one was giving the appellant "a  hard  time"  so
         there was  no  reason  to  make  a  claim.  That  completed  cross-
         examination.


     17. In re-examination, the witness clarified that the  reference  to  a
         customary marriage document was the written consent he had received
         from the appellant's family. He confirmed it had been submitted  to
         the Home Office. He said they had been for an interview in 2016 and
         were then given  permission  to  marry.  That  completed  the  oral
         evidence.


     18. I then heard submissions. Mr Melvin submitted  that  the  appellant
         could be expected to return to Pakistan and make an entry clearance
         application.  He  submitted  that  no  legal  representative  would
         suggest that it was an abuse of the system not to appeal. There was
         no barrier to return, with or without the  husband.  There  was  no
         persecution of the Christian community and the issue appeared to be
         one of finance but a large sum had been spent on IVF treatment.  Mr
         Melvin submitted that had  been  obtained  to  bolster  the  claim,
         particularly given that the medical advice was  to  deal  with  the
         fibroids first. There was no evidence that IVF treatment would  not
         be available in Pakistan. The couple had  entered  into  the  three
         cycles with a view to prolonging the appellant's stay so  that  she
         could make a 20 year claim in  a  year.  There  had  been  repeated
         attempts to frustrate removal.  The  correct  procedure  should  be
         followed.  There  were   no   insurmountable   obstacles   to   the
         continuation  of  family  life  overseas.  There   were   no   very
         significant obstacles to integration  and  the  appellant  and  her
         husband had family there. Whether the matter was considered in  the
         round outside the rules, it would be proportionate  to  expect  the
         appellant to  return  to  Pakistan  and  make  an  entry  clearance
         application.


     19. Mr Ahmed  submitted  that  there  had  been  no  challenge  to  the
         relationship which began in 2008  and  to  the  cohabitation  which
         commenced in 2009. The appellant's leave had  expired  in  November
         2009 and so the relationship had not commenced during a  period  of
         overstaying. The first attempt at IVF was in October 2009 and so it
         was wrong to say that this was used to bolster  her  chances  of  a
         successful application. Conception had become more  difficult  with
         age. That was why they pursued IVF. It had previously  been  halted
         so that they could sort out the appellant's immigration status. The
         application was refused in March  2015  and  litigation  had  taken
         three years. The appellant could not be blamed for that. It was not
         realistic to expect them to return to Pakistan  and  start  another
         cycle of IVF there. The time line had meant urgent action had  been
         required otherwise there had been  no  intention  to  commence  IVF
         treatment this year.  This  was  an  insurmountable  obstacle.  The
         information about visa processing times made little sense. This was
         not a case where the appellant had sought to frustrate removal  but
         if the respondent took that view, then  it  was  possible  the  ECO
         would take the same  view  when  considering  any  entry  clearance
         application. The sponsor had  a  business.  He  had  been  back  to
         Pakistan in 2004 and 2015; it was unrealistic that he would fit  in
         now. He was making a positive  contribution  to  the  economy.  The
         appellant had been entitled to apply for indefinite leave to remain
         when her leave expired. She had made appropriate applications.  The
         appellant could not return to Pakistan because of her IVF treatment
         and in October 2019  she  would  have  completed  twenty  years  of
         residence. Whilst IVF treatment was available in Pakistan,  it  was
         of a different standard. This was the last chance. Her relationship
         and the treatment amounted to very significant difficulties for re-
         integration. It  would  be  proportionate  for  her  appeal  to  be
         allowed. Reliance was placed on Agyarko and Ikuga  [2017]  UKSC  11
         and it was argued that the financial requirements could be met, the
         appellant had gained qualifications during her time  here  and  had
         been here lawfully. She had taken a language test and a Life in the
         UK test. If the application was certain to be granted,  the  public
         interest in removal was reduced. Section 117B factors were met. She
         was not a burden on the state. The appeal should be allowed.


     20. That completed the hearing. I reserved my decision which I now give
         with reasons.


 Discussion and findings

     21. I have considered the submissions made by both sides with care  and
         I have had regard to the evidence before the Tribunal. My  findings
         are not set out in any order of priority. I  confirm  that  I  have
         considered all the evidence as a whole before reaching  a  decision
         and that I have had regard to the fact that the burden lies on  the
         appellant to make out her case to the civil standard at the date of
         the hearing.


     22. Under EX.1. of the Immigration Rules, the  appellant  has  to  show
         that she "has a genuine and subsisting relationship with a  partner
         who is in the UK and is a British citizen, settled in the UK or  in
         the UK with refugee leave or humanitarian protection, and there are
         insurmountable  obstacles  to  family  life   with   that   partner
         continuing outside the UK".  Under paragraph 276 ADE(vi), she  must
         show that she is "aged 18 years or above, has lived continuously in
         the  UK  for  less  than  20  years  (discounting  any  period   of
         imprisonment) but that there would be very significant obstacles to
         the applicant's integration into the country to which he would have
         to go if required to leave the UK".


     23. The Tribunal is also required to consider s.  117A  and  B  of  the
         Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002  (as  amended).  This
         provides:



         117A:

         (1)This Part applies where a  court  or  tribunal  is  required  to
         determine whether a decision made under the Immigration Acts-

         (a)breaches a person's right to respect for private and family life
         under Article 8, and

         (b)as a result would be unlawful  under  section  6  of  the  Human
         Rights Act 1998.

         (2)In considering  the  public  interest  question,  the  court  or
         tribunal must (in particular) have regard-

         (a)in all cases, to the considerations listed in section 117B, and

         (b)in cases concerning the deportation of foreign criminals, to the
         considerations listed in section 117C.

         (3)In subsection (2), "the  public  interest  question"  means  the
         question of whether  an  interference  with  a  person's  right  to
         respect for private and family  life  is  justified  under  Article
         8(2).




         117B Article 8: public interest considerations  applicable  in  all
         cases

         (1)The maintenance of effective  immigration  controls  is  in  the
         public interest.

         (2)It is in the public interest, and in particular in the interests
         of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that persons  who

         independent, because such persons-

         (a)are not a burden on taxpayers, and

         (5)Little weight should be given to a private life established by a

         precarious.

         ...................



     24. I have not been provided with copies  of  the  appellant's  earlier
         applications for leave in November 2009 and April 2013, but I  have
         the decision letters in  respect  of  those  applications  and  the
         determination of 2010. This appeal arises from the  refusal  of  an
         application made for indefinite leave to remain outside  the  rules
         on 26 March 2015.


     25. The appellant relies on her relationship with [DS] whom she married
         in September 2016 subsequent to the making of the  application  and
         its refusal. The application itself was based on her long residence
         (fifteen years at the time), the  relationship,  and  her  fear  of
         returning to Pakistan which she described as a "back up"  (RB:A6  &
         C1). In her 2015 application, the appellant refers to  a  customary
         marriage conducted by her husband and his and her families  but  no
         evidence of this is included in the documents before me. This point
         was pursued at the hearing as it was not clear what had been  meant
         by this but I am no clearer on the matter. It appears to have  been
         a visit by the appellant's partner to her mother and brother during
         which their approval for the marriage was sought. I am at a loss to
         understand why this was referred to as a customary marriage by  the
         appellant and her partner in the  written  evidence  and  no  clear
         explanation was provided in oral evidence.


     26. There are also inconsistencies in the evidence as to when they met.
         In her evidence to Judge Ross, the appellant stated  that  she  had
         known her husband in Pakistan as he came from her  village  but  he
         said they had met in 2009. In the sponsor's written  statement,  he
         maintained they had met in college in 2003, even before she married
         her first husband (AB:27). She claimed that they had  met  in  2006
         (AB:54). In oral evidence before me, both claimed to  have  met  in
         2008. I also note that at the hearing of her  appeal  before  Judge
         Baldwin in 2010, the appellant was still said to be married to  her
         first husband and the relationship with her new  partner  (now  her
         husband) was mentioned for the first time at  the  hearing  itself.
         Although these matters are not directly material to the outcome  of
         this appeal, as the respondent has  accepted  the  relationship  as
         genuine and subsisting, they do  suggest  that  the  full  truthful
         picture has not been provided. Further,  whilst  it  is  still  not
         clear to me why there was such a delay in  getting  married,  that,
         too, does not impact upon the outcome of this appeal.


     27. The appellant has not sought  asylum  at  any  point  although  she
         maintains that she cannot safely return to Pakistan. In her current
         application, she  complains  that  her  former  husband  (whom  she
         married in December 2003, according to C3, but in 2004 according to
         her oral evidence and [DS]'s evidence at AB:27) and who joined  her
         in the UK in October 2004, held a grudge against her.   She  claims
         that the divorce deed of 17 March 2009 cites her as the  petitioner
         and that this would place her at risk on return. It  is  maintained
         that he has returned home to the same village where the appellant's
         family live and that  he  could  find  her  there  or  anywhere  in
         Pakistan.


     28. There are serious issues arising over this claim. The first is that
         the appellant told Judge Baldwin in April 2010 that she  was  still
         married and that no steps  had  been  taken  to  formally  end  the
         marriage (AB:54, paragraph 12). There is no explanation for why she
         would have said this if there had been a divorce deed issues over a
         year earlier. The second problem is that at the hearing before  me,
         the appellant did not make any mention of problems arising from the
         divorce deed and its contents. She suggested there  had  been  some
         altercation following her discovery of his  previous  marriage  and
         because of general problems faced by Christians in  Pakistan.  Once
         again, I find that the appellant  has  not  been  truthful  in  her
         evidence.


     29. In any event, there have been no threats against  her  since  2010.
         There is no basis for the claim that the ex-spouse would be able to
         trace her anywhere in Pakistan and if she wished to avoid him,  she
         could relocate with her current husband. I shall address the  issue
         of his return later. He, in fact, stated that no one had given  her
         "a hard time" and that she would not need to seek  asylum  although
         he  referred  generally  to  difficulties  for   Christians.    The
         appellant has returned to visit her family  on  numerous  occasions
         and no problems have arisen. Her partner has also visited and  does
         not mention any problems arising in his witness statement. There is
         no suggestion that any of  their  respective  family  members  have
         faced any problems either despite the appellant's evidence that her
         family are well known evangelists (at C5). I  also  note  that  her
         studies were funded by a UK church with links to Pakistan.  On  the
         available evidence, I am not satisfied  that  the  appellant  would
         have any cause to fear returning to  Pakistan  on  account  of  her
         former husband or her religion. That is not, therefore,  either  an
         insurmountable obstacle to the enjoyment of family life in Pakistan
         or a very significant obstacle to re-integration.


     30. I turn now to the IVF treatment the appellant  has  received.  This
         was put forward in Mr Ahmed's submissions as the  main  factor  for
         meeting both the tests under EX.1 and 276ADE(vi). I note that there
         is  no  reference  to  the  previous  treatment  of  2009  in   the
         appellant's application of 2015 and it was not  put  forward  as  a
         reason for not being  able  to  return  to  Pakistan;  nor  was  it
         suggested that it would be sought in the future. It  was  also  not
         mentioned to Judge Baldwin and I have not seen any evidence that it
         was  carried  out.  The  only  evidence  relating  to  IVF  in  the
         appellant's initial bundle was to October 2015.


     31. It is said that the first cycle of IVF treatment was undertaken  in
         2009 just a few months after the couple commenced cohabitation. The
         next, for which there is evidence, commenced  shortly  before  this
         appeal hearing. I note the submissions made by both parties on this
         point. Whilst Mr Ahmed is right to say that the appellant's student
         visa had not expired at the time of the treatment, it is also right
         that the said treatment commenced the month before it  expired  and
         so Mr Melvin's submission on its timing is, on the face  of  it,  a
         valid one. The difficulty with Mr Melvyn's  argument  is,  however,
         that the appellant did not apparently rely on any relationship when
         making her application in 2009. Indeed, as I have mentioned,  there
         was no mention at all of any partner until the date of the  hearing
         in April 2010 so if IVF treatment had been received in 2009, and  I
         have not seen any evidence of it, then it was not a  factor  relied
         upon in the appellant's application for leave at that time.


     32.  The same cannot, however, be said for the  most  recent  treatment
         obtained just before the appeal hearing. This  followed  a  lengthy
         gap of nine  years,  for  which  she  and  her  husband  both  gave
         different reasons. The appellant, in oral evidence, stated they had
         been waiting for her  immigration  status  to  be  resolved  before
         seeking treatment  but  that  it  became  urgent  because  she  had
         fibroids in and on  the  uterus.  In  her  witness  statement,  she
         referred only to the  uncertainty  of  her  status.  Her  husband's
         evidence, however, was that he had needed to save up to pay for the
         costs, although I note  from  the  evidence  that  he  already  had
         sufficient funds  to  pay  for  the  treatment  in  2016  (AB:181).
         Whatever the motivation, and I accept that the couple  are  anxious
         to have children, this does not constitute an  obstacle  either  to
         the enjoyment of family life in Pakistan or to the appellant's  re-
         integration. The evidence from  the  appellant's  husband  is  that
         treatment is available in Pakistan and indeed he spoke to a  clinic
         offering IVF but that the standard  in  the  UK  was  better.  That
         assertion is based on a single call but even if it were  the  case,
         it is well established in the case  law  on  health  cases  that  a
         differential in the standard of available care is inadequate as the
         basis for a successful appeal. Where  the  case  law  goes  against
         individuals  even  with  serious  illnesses  and   life-threatening
         conditions, it is difficult to see how a wish for children, and  to
         receive treatment in the UK, can result in a successful outcome for
         the appellant. My  finding  is  reinforced  by  the  Supreme  Court
         judgment in Agyarko and Ikuga (relied on by  Mr  Ahmed)  where  the
         employment of Mrs  Ikuga's  partner  and  the  fact  that  she  was
         receiving fertility treatment, were found not to even possibly meet
         the required tests.


     33. The other factors put forward for the EX.1 test are the appellant's
         husband's work, the uncertainty of the visa process  and  the  fact
         that in just under a year the appellant will be eligible for making
         an application for  leave  based  on  twenty  years  of  residence.
         Essentially, this is a near miss argument and it  is  difficult  to
         see how any of these factors can meet the insurmountable  obstacles
         test; that is to say, they do not show  that  it  would  be  unduly
         harsh for the couple to continue family life in Pakistan or for the
         appellant to return and seek entry  clearance  through  the  proper
         channels. In most cases, a move would cause  disruption  and  would
         interfere with employment in  the  UK.  There  is  nothing  in  the
         circumstances of this  appellant  or  her  husband's  circumstances
         which would result in unjustifiably  harsh  consequences  or  which
         makes their circumstances any  different  from  any  other  married
         couple.  It  was  also  submitted  that  the  appellant   met   the
         requirements of the Immigration Rules and that there was  therefore
         no public interest in her removal. However, Mr Ahmed also submitted
         that entry clearance might not be granted  because  the  ECO  might
         take the view that she had sought to frustrate removal.  The  grant
         of entry clearance is not clear cut  in  the  circumstances  and  I
         cannot find that the requirements of the rules  have  been  met  or
         that the Chikwamba principles would  apply.  The  time  period  for
         applications to  be  decided  are  contained  in  the  respondent's
         evidence. There is  no  undue  delay  involved  and  there  are  no
         children to be concerned about.


     34. The appellant entered the UK as a student.  She  was  always  aware
         that the expectation would be that  she  would  have  to  leave  on
         completion of her studies. She obtained a degree and  yet  remained
         after her studies had been completed. She and  her  future  husband
         commenced a relationship when her leave was nearing its end and  as
         her husband, himself, stated in his supporting letter, he knew  she
         was here on a temporary  visa.  Their  relationship  was  therefore
         entered  into  knowing  that  her  stay  was  precarious.  Repeated
         applications were made after her first application was refused  and
         her appeal was dismissed in 2010. Whilst Mr  Ahmed  submitted  that
         the appellant had been entitled to make the application  to  remain
         on the basis  of  ten  years'  continuous,  lawful  residence,  the
         evidence does  not  support  that  argument.  As  was  conceded  by
         experienced Counsel at the 2010 hearing, the respondent (at  AB:44)
         was right to say that the appellant had a gap of 164  days  in  her
         leave (AB:55) and indeed, the  appellant  herself  acknowledged  as
         such (AB:26). The appellant should, therefore,  have  left  the  UK
         when her application was refused. She  has,  instead  remained  and
         made further unsuccessful applications.


     35.  I have also considered the claim outside the rules. I accept  that
         there is family life between the  appellant  and  her  husband.  In
         respect of private life, I accept that the appellant is  undergoing
         IVF treatment, that she is well liked by friends and church  goers,
         as the supporting  letters  indicate  and  that  she  has  acquired
         educational qualifications as a  result  of  her  studies.  I  also
         accept that the  appellant's  removal  would  interfere  with  both
         private and family life. However, the  appellant  established  both
         when her stay was precarious.  Despite being refused further  leave
         and  losing  her  first  appeal,  she  remained  and  made  further
         applications. I accept that the recent few years of litigation were
         not of her making but she had already been told in  2010  that  she
         did not qualify to remain. She achieved the qualifications she came
         here for and these are transferable to Pakistan where both she  and
         her husband have close family. the appellant's husband maintains he
         cannot return to Pakistan because of his employment and his ties to
         the community but as  the  case  law  establishes,  these  are  not
         matters which render the decision disproportionate.  In reaching my
         decision, I take account of the s.117B factors and accept that  the
         appellant speaks English and would not be a burden  on  the  state.
         However, these are neutral factors and the  public  interest  still
         requires enforcement of the rules  where,  as  in  the  appellant's
         case,  private/family  life  is  established  during  a  period  of
         precarious/unlawful stay. The  appellant's  stay  has  always  been
         precarious and parts of it have been unlawful (i.e. in between  the
         applications made). The fact that she will complete twenty years in
         late 2019 does not assist her; no authority was relied on  to  show
         that a shortfall of some 11 months can count  as  a  near  miss  to
         justify a grant of discretionary leave.
     36. In all the circumstances, the appellant can  continue  her  private
         and family life overseas with her husband. Alternatively,  she  can
         should be expected to return to Pakistan, with or without him,  and
         make a fresh application for entry clearance.  No good reasons have
         been given for why she cannot do that.
