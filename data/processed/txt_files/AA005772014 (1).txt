                       Solicitors.

                         DETERMINATION: ERROR OF LAW


   1. This is an appeal against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge  K
      W Brown promulgated on  12  March  2014,  dismissing  the  Appellant's
      appeal against the Respondent's decision  dated  12  January  2014  to
      remove him from the UK following the refusal of  his  application  for
      asylum.


Background

   2. The Appellant is a national of Sri Lanka born on 27 June 1989.


   3. The Appellant's immigration history was summarised at paragraph 10  of
      the Respondent's  'reasons  for  refusal  letter'  ('RFRL')  dated  12
      January 2014. In  the  event  there  is  some  controversy  over  this
      history: see further below. For the moment, suffice to  say  that  the
      Appellant claims he last arrived in the UK on 1 May 2013  from  France
      having left Sri Lanka on 30 April 2013. On 7 May 2013 he sought asylum
      at the ASU in Croydon; his claim was registered on 16 May 2013.


   4. The Appellant's application for asylum was refused for reasons set out
      in the RFRL of 12 January 2014. A Notice of Immigration Decision  also
      dated 12 January 2014 was served on 15 January 2014 in consequence.


   5. The Appellant appealed to the IAC.


   6. The Appellant's appeal was dismissed by the  First-tier  Tribunal  for
      reasons set out in the determination promulgated on 12 March 2014.


   7. The Appellant applied for permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal:
      this was initially refused by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Foudy,  but
      subsequently granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Grubb on 19 May 2014.


Error of Law

   8. It was a feature of the Appellant's case that he had previously held a
      Tier 4 (General) Student visa valid from 21  December  2010  until  16
      March 2012. He had come to the UK on 6 January 2011  and  returned  to
      Sri Lanka on 21 February 2012. At his screening interview  on  16  May
      2013. The Appellant claimed that when he left Sri Lanka  on  30  April
      2013 he travelled on "a passport that the agent used for me", and that
      his own national passport was "left in Sri Lanka" (Respondent's bundle
      A4)


   9. At the appeal hearing before the First-tier Tribunal it was indicated,
      again, that the Appellant's own Sri Lankan passport was at his home in
      Sri Lanka, and the Judge acceded to a  request  from  the  Appellant's
      representative to consider a copy of the passport if it were  supplied
      within a few days of the hearing: see determination at paragraph 14.


  10. The Judge received and took into account a certified copy of  the  Sri
      Lankan passport. The Judge  identified  "an  embarkation  stamp  on  6
      January 2013" (paragraph 14).


  11. It is clear that the Judge found  the  information  conveyed  by  this
      stamp to be inconsistent with the Appellant's  account,  and  in  turn
      placed very considerable reliance upon this inconsistency in  reaching
      an adverse determination of the Appellant's  account  -  including  in
      particular not believing his account of detention and finding that  he
      had deliberately had himself scarred in order to make a  false  asylum
      claim. In this context see in particular paragraphs 30, 32 and 34.


  12. In challenging the First-tier Tribunal Judge's decision, the Appellant
      pleads that the Judge has misread the stamp. It is,  he  submits,  the
      embarkation stamp of 6 January 2011, consistent with  the  immigration
      history acknowledged by the Respondent. Moreover, it  is  pointed  out
      that the Appellant did not exit Sri Lanka using this passport -  which
      is why it remained in Sri Lanka.


  13. I have noted the version of the relevant passport  stamp  that  is  on
      file. It is not reproduced at full scale. Further, as I understand it,
      a copy was taken from the original in Sri Lanka, scanned, attached  to
      an email, forwarded to the Appellant's solicitors in London,  printed,
      and then sent to the Tribunal by facsimile transmission. The  date  is
      not, in my judgement, readily discernible as being 2011 or 2013.


  14. For reasons that are unclear to me Ms Peterson had not  been  provided
      with a better version of the stamp to present to the Tribunal today


  15. The Judge has not indicated  that  she  had  regard  to  the  possible
      connection with the acknowledged embarkation on 6  January  2011  when
      considering this  stamp.  Nor  has  the  Judge  apparently  sought  to
      reconcile her interpretation of the stamp with the  Appellant's  claim
      not to have travelled on his own passport in 2013.


  16. Be that as it may, and notwithstanding that  there  is  not  presently
      available a clearer version of the stamp, in circumstances  where  the
      Judge's interpretation of this  document  very  greatly  informed  her
      evaluation of the credibility of the Appellant's case, it seems to  me
      that if  the  Judge  were  so  troubled  she  should  have  considered
      reconvening the hearing to allow the Appellant to  be  heard  on  this
      matter. The failure to permit the Appellant  such  an  opportunity  to
      address a point not raised by the Respondent and  not  raised  at  the
      hearing was, in my judgement, a breach of natural justice.


  17. I find that the Judge erred in law accordingly, on a  material  matter
      that went to the heart of the Appellant's credibility.


  18. I note that Ms Isherwood very fairly acknowledged  the  unsatisfactory
      nature of the Determination in this regard, and was also in  agreement
      with Ms Peterson's  submission  that  the  consequence  was  that  the
      decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  should  be  set  aside  and  the
      decision in the appeal be remade before the First-tier Tribunal.


  19. In circumstances where the decision is set aside on the  basis  of  an
      error of law involving the deprivation of the Appellant's right  to  a
      fair hearing, I accept that the appropriate course is to  remit  to  a
      differently constituted First-tier Tribunal for a fresh  hearing:  see
      MM (unfairness; E & R) Sudan [2014] UKUT 00105 (IAC) at paragraph 26.


Decision

  20. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge contained  an  error  of
      law and is set aside.


  21. The decision in the appeal is  to  be  remade  before  the  First-tier
      Tribunal by any judge other than First-tier Tribunal Judge KW Brown.


      Consequent Direction

      1. The Appellant is to file and serve within 14 days clear  prints  of
      the scan of his passport. Further, if the  original  of  the  passport
      becomes available, as was intimated in the  solicitors'  letter  of  4
      March 2014 enclosing the certified copy of the passport,  this  should
      be brought to the appeal hearing.
