For the Respondent:    Mr S Walker, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant is a citizen of India whose date of birth is recorded  as
    18th December 1985.  He brought an appeal to  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    heard by Judge Hodgkinson on 30th January 2014 against the decision  of
    the Secretary of State of 24th May 2013 to refuse to vary his leave  to
    remain in the United Kingdom as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur)  having  regard
    to paragraph 245DD of HC 395 (as amended) and to remove  him  from  the
    United Kingdom by way of directions  pursuant  to  Section  47  of  the
    Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.

 2. The refusal is helpfully set out in part in the determination of  Judge
    Hodgkinson and it is convenient to rehearse it here:

         "...You have stated that you have access to at  least  ï¿½200,000  to
         invest in business in the United Kingdom in line with Appendix A of
         the Immigration Rules.

         71.  Paragraph 245A and 46 of Appendix A of the  Immigration  Rules
             state that  only  specified  documents  will  be  accepted  as
             evidence of this requirement.   The  specified  documents  are
             listed below.  Applicants must provide the following document:

             i)   a letter from  each  financial  institution  holding  the
                  applicant's  funds,  to  confirm  the  amount   of   money
                  available to the applicant, or the two applicants if  they
                  have formed an entrepreneurial team.

                  Each letter  must  also  confirm  each  of  the  following
                  details:

                  the name of the applicant, or both applicants if they have
                  formed an entrepreneurial team.

         As the bank documents from the Department  of  Post  Government  of
         India do not contain your name or that you  have  access  to  these
         funds they have been discounted from our calculations and therefore
         you are unable to demonstrate that you  have  access  to  funds  as
         required.

         We have therefore  been  unable  to  award  points,  in  line  with
         published guidance and Appendix A of the Immigration Rules."

 3. The Secretary of State had also refused the application  on  the  basis
    that the requisite English  language  test  certificate  had  not  been
    submitted  but  the  judge  resolved  that  particular  issue  in   the
    Appellant's favour.

 4. Judge Hodgkinson considered the arguments and before him much  appeared
    to turn on evidential flexibility.  Be that as it may he dismissed  the
    appeal on all grounds finding that the requirements  of  paragraph  41-
    SD(a)(i) of Appendix A had not been satisfied.  Indeed, it is  of  note
    at paragraph 20 of the determination that Mr Syed-Ali, who continues to
    represent the Appellant, accepted that not all of the  requirements  of
    that paragraph had been met.

 5. Not content with that decision, by notice dated 12th February 2014  the
    Appellant made application  for  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal, which was eventually granted on a renewed application.  There
    are a number of grounds but I can shorten matters because  Mr  Syed-Ali
    before me  made  plain  that  the  basis  upon  which  he  pursues  the
    Appellant's appeal is that the requirement of the Rule simply cannot be
    met because of the law relating to trusts such that what is required of
    the bank is so onerous that no  bank  reasonably  can  be  expected  to
    comply with what is required.  In short therefore the Appellant's  case
    is that the Rule is itself unfair.

 6. Permission to appeal was initially refused in the  First-tier  Tribunal
    but that application was renewed before the Upper Tribunal and  on  3rd
    June 2014 Upper Tribunal Judge Rintoul granted permission on the  basis
    that paragraph 245AA, which deals with evidential flexibility, had  not
    been considered.  He considered that there  was  less  merit  in  other
    grounds but gave permission nevertheless for them to be argued.

 7. As it was Mr Syed-Ali did not pursue the point in relation to paragraph
    245AA before me because he submitted that everything "fell into  place"
    on a proper construction of trust law.  It remains common  ground  that
    the  letter  from  the  bank  did  not  contain  all  of  the  material
    information.

 8. Mr Syed-Ali helpfully presented me with a skeleton argument and because
    there is the possibility that this matter may be taken  further  I  set
    out within this determination rather more of his skeleton argument than
    I might otherwise have done.

 9. The Secretary of State,  represented  by  Mr  Walker  not  surprisingly
    relies on the case of Durrani (Entrepreneurs: bank letters;  evidential
    flexibility) [2014] UKUT 00295 In fairness to Mr Syed-Ali he recognises
    the difficulties which face him arising from that particular  decision;
    indeed he makes reference to it quite  properly  in  his  own  skeleton
    argument.

10. The head note in the case of Durrani reads as follows:

         "(1) The requirements listed in paragraph 41-SD(a)(i) of the  Rules
             are to be construed reasonably and  sensibly,  in  their  full
             context.  Approached in this way, the  letters  required  from
             banks or other financial  institutions  are  not  designed  to
             provide, and do not commit them to, any form of  guarantee  or
             assurance  to  any  party.   Rather,  the  function   of   the
             prescribed letters is to attest to the state of  the  relevant
             bank account on the date when they are written and to  provide
             certain other items of information  designed  to  confirm  the
             authenticity of the application  for  entrepreneurial  migrant
             status and its economic viability.  There is no difficulty  in
             the third party bank, with its customer's consent,  expressing
             its understanding, based on the customer's instructions,  that
             the use of specified funds in the customer's bank account/s is
             contemplated or proposed by the customer for  the  purpose  of
             financing   the   applicant's   proposed   business   venture.
             Accordingly, there is no substance in the  argument  that  the
             relevant  requirements  contained  in  paragraph   41-SD(a)(i)
             produce an absurd result and must, therefore,  be  interpreted
             in some other manner.

         (2)  The question of whether a policy exists is one of fact.  There
             is no evidence that some  policy  on  evidential  flexibility,
             independent and freestanding of paragraph 245AA, survived  the
             introduction of that paragraph in the Immigration Rules."

11. For the sake of completeness I observe that the  second  point  in  the
    head note of Durrani  is  not  material  to  this  appeal.   The  first
    paragraph  is  taken  from  paragraph  12  of  the  main  body  of  the
    determination.

12. Mr Syed-Ali's submissions are based on the fact that in the case  where
    it is a third party that is providing the funds or part thereof  rather
    than the applicant there is too onerous a requirement on the  bank.  Mr
    Syed-Ali relies on Barclays Bank -v- Quistclose Investments Ltd  [1970]
    AC 567 and also Twinsectra Limited -v- Yardley and Others  [2002]  UKHL
    12.

13. In short Mr Syed-Ali submits that where a party borrows  money  from  a
    bank or tells the bank that monies are to  be  used  for  a  particular
    purpose and the bank then warrants that the money is  to  be  used  for
    that purpose there is a trust created at that stage in  favour  of,  in
    this case, the applicant, a third party who becomes  a  beneficiary  of
    that trust.  The trustees would be the person in whose  name  the  bank
    account is held and the bank.

14. Since no bank, in Mr Syed-Ali's submission, would be willing  to  be  a
    party to such an arrangement it follows that no bank would  be  willing
    to give the undertakings required under the Rules.

15. Firstly I observe that  Mr  Syed-Ali  did  not  come  to  me  with  any
    sufficient evidence in support of his contention that a bank would  not
    be willing to provide that information and in fairness to  Mr  Syed-Ali
    he accepted that he did not have that evidence.  I am not  prepared  to
    take judicial notice of what is being submitted  by  Mr  Syed-Ali.   It
    seems  to  me  that  it  is  a  matter  that  requires  some  evidence,
    particularly because it may be  that  different  banks  have  different
    policies, either within the same country or from country to country;  I
    simply do not know.

16. Mr Syed-Ali submits that the point which he has raised with respect  to
    trusts was not fully considered in the case of  Durrani  and  in  those
    circumstances he seeks to distinguish the finding in Durrani.

17. I consider myself bound by the case of Durrani.  It seems  to  me  that
    paragraph 12 in the case of Durrani in which the President of the Upper
    Tribunal stated:-

         "Approached in this way, we consider  it  clear  that  the  letters
         required  from  banks  or  other  financial  institutions  are  not
         designed to provide, and  do  not  commit  them  to,  any  form  of
         guarantee or assurance to any party",

    contemplates waiver on the part of the person in whose  name  the  bank
    account is held.  In those circumstances even if there is merit in  the
    point that a trust is created there is no difficulty it seems to me  on
    the part of the bank in supplying the information provided.

18. One has to look to the mischief.  What is  it  that  the  Secretary  of
    State is looking for?  Primarily the Secretary of State is concerned to
    know that this is a genuine application.  The  Secretary  of  State  of
    course  has  the  assertion  by  the  applicant  that  monies  will  be
    available.   Unfortunately  there  are  some  applicants  who  are  not
    altogether or always truthful. In order that  the  Secretary  of  State
    might  further  or  better  be  informed  there  is   this   additional
    requirement.  It is to be remembered that the standard of proof both in
    this case and indeed for the Secretary of State is one  of  balance  of
    probabilities and the Secretary of State has determined that  she  will
    be satisfied that the requirement of the Rule is met  if  the  bank  is
    willing to corroborate, for that is what it is, the  assertion  of  the
    applicant that the money will be for a particular purpose. I see little
    difference between this requirement and  the  circumstances  in  which,
    from time to time, in civil proceedings previous consistent  statements
    are not capable of corroborating that which is being asserted.

19. In all of the circumstances therefore I note  the  argument  which  has
    been put by Mr Syed-Ali but with the greatest of respect to  him  I  do
    not see the merit in it.

20. I dictated this determination in front of the parties  deliberately  in
    order that Mr Syed-Ali would have the opportunity to raise with  me  at
    this point any matter which he felt that  I  had  not  adequately  made
    mention of lest it be said, should he take the matter further, that  he
    had not raised a point at this hearing.

21. Mr Syed-Ali confirmed at this point that I had  made  mention  in  this
    determination of  all  the  points  which  he  had  raised  before  me.
    Generally he wished to reserve his position in relation  to  any  other
    points but of course that will be a matter for any  other  jurisdiction
    which may in time come  to  consider  this  matter  if  it  is  thought
    appropriate or indeed if the matter is taken further.

22. In the circumstances I find that there was  no  error  of  law  in  the
    determination of the First-tier Tribunal and the appeal accordingly  is
    dismissed.

Decision

The appeal to the Upper Tribunal is dismissed and the decision of the First-
tier Tribunal shall stand
