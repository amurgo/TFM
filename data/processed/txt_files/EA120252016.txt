                                     And

                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent
Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms K Turner, Direct Access counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr T Lindsay, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONs

         1. First-tier Tribunal Judge Bartlett  dismissed  the  appellant's
            appeal against the respondent's refusal to  issue  her  with  a
            permanent residence card as the spouse of an EU  national  with
            permanent residence. The judge found that her husband  had  not
            acquired permanent residence and therefore she did not qualify.
            Permission to appeal was sought on  the  grounds,  inter  alia,
            that it was arguable that it was a material error  of  law  for
            the judge to place no weight at all  on  the  letter  from  DWP
            stating that  her  husband  had  a  right  to  reside  and  was
            habitually resident.


         2. The respondent in his Rule 24 response stated that he  did  not
            oppose the appellant's application for permission  and  invited
            the Upper Tribunal to determine the  appeal  at  a  continuance
            hearing  to  determine  whether  the  appellant  had   acquired
            permanent residence. Ms Turner filed, late and  without  having
            made a prior request for leave to file additional documents,  a
            bundle of documents which the appellant sought to rely upon. Mr
            Lindsay did  not  express  an  objection  to  the  late  filing
            although he had not been aware that the respondent accepted the
            First-tier Tribunal judge had made a material error of law.  He
            did not have a copy of the bundle of documents  filed  for  the
            appeal before me - whether that was because they had  not  been
            served on the respondent or they had not reached his file, I do
            not know. He was provided with a copy. After time  to  consider
            the documents filed, he  was  ready  to  proceed  and  I  heard
            submissions from both Ms Turner and Mr Lindsay. I did not  hear
            oral evidence from either the  appellant  or  her  husband,  it
            being agreed that this appeal turned on documentary evidence.

         3. I have some concerns whether, having  been  instructed  through
            Direct  Access,  Ms  Turner  has  strayed  into  the  role   of
            conducting litigation by filing documents personally. Ms Turner
            also asked to be sent a copy of my decision direct. She is  not
            on the record and I expressed my doubts that she  could  go  on
            the record because  she  has  been  instructed  through  Direct
            Access. These are of course matters for her but she may wish to
            make the appropriate enquires to ensure she does not breach the
            Bar Standards Code.

         4. Although referred  to  in  her  skeleton  argument,  Ms  Turner
            accepted that she could not rely on Mr Fernadez Diz's claims as
            a  job  seeker  and  evidence  of  actively  seeking  work,  as
            supporting his claim to have been permanently resident. She was
            correct to so  accept.  Mr  Fernandez,  although  claiming  job
            seeker's allowance for a number  of  years,  has  not  produced
            evidence as to why  he  became  unemployed  and  he  is  not  a
            Qualifying  Person  under  the  Regulations  because  of  those
            claims, without more.

         5. The  respondent  does  not  seek  to  challenge  the  validity,
            genuineness or subsistence of the appellant's  marriage  to  Mr
            Fernandez Diz - the issue in this appeal is solely  on  whether
            Mr Fernandez Diz has permanent residence.

         6. Ms Turner submitted that the respondent  had  set  too  high  a
            burden and standard of proof upon the appellant:  the  guidance
            issued  by  the  respondent  in  connection  with  claims   for
            residence stated that  evidence  of  such  residence  could  be
            provided by HMRC records, payslips and evidence  of  NICS;  the
            appellant had provided her husband's NIC  contribution  records
            and had the respondent required more then he could  and  should
            have requested this; to  now  rely  on  a  lack  of  additional
            evidence was indicative of too high a standard of  proof.  This
            submission is misconceived.  Firstly,  the  evidence  that  was
            provided to the respondent when the  original  application  was
            made was very sparse. The burden of proof is upon an applicant.
            It is not for the respondent to trawl through the evidence that
            has been submitted and make a request for evidence which may or
            may not  exist  in  order  to  sustain  an  applicant's  claim.
            Although the guidance refers to HMRC and  NICS  records,  those
            are  examples  of  possibly  supportive  evidence.  The  burden
            remains  on  an  applicant  to   prove,   on   a   balance   of
            probabilities, that s/he has been continuously employed for the
            requisite period of time or otherwise  meets  the  criteria  of
            being a Qualified Person.

         7. The appeal is now before me. The appellant  is  aware  why  her
            appeal before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  was  dismissed,  that
            dismissal including  the  finding  that  there  was  inadequate
            evidence to  sustain  a  finding  that  Mr  Fernandez  Diz  had
            acquired permanent residence. She has sought and  obtained  the
            services of counsel through  Direct  Access  who  prepared  and
            submitted a bundle of documents on her behalf,  having  advised
            her of the nature of the evidence required to prove  continuous
            residence for the requisite period. It is disingenuous  to  now
            submit that the respondent  should  have  requested  additional
            documents, particularly since it seems that the respondent  was
            not served with bundle of documents relied upon in the  hearing
            before me.

         8. The evidence now filed in support of the  claim  to  have  been
            exercising Treaty Rights for five years consisted of:

              . A letter with print out from HMRC  of  Mr  Fernandez  Diz's
                primary paid earnings records for the  period  after  1975;
                primary paid earnings are, as  I  understand  it,  earnings
                upon which national insurance contributions become payable.
              . Letters concerning Job Seekers Allowance (no longer  relied
                upon to  establish  continuous  residence  as  a  qualified
                person).
              . Work history schedule provided by Mr Fernandez Diz.
              . Letter from HMRC dated 4th April 2018 providing information
                on employers from 1971 to 1975 and  NI  contributions  from
                1971 to 2015/16.
              . Letter from DWP dated 17th October 2014.

         9. Other documents were in the bundle relating to tenancy,  Credit
            Union, copy status documents,  job  seeker  allowance,  pension
            calculations but these are not relevant to  the  assessment  of
            whether Mr Fernandez Diz has acquired permanent residence.


        10. HMRC confirm primary paid earnings as follows:

             2015/16       no record provided        52 credits


        11. Mr Fernandez Diz was employed each financial year between April
            6th 1975 and April 5th 1981. His earnings during each of  those
            years exceeded the minimum required before  National  Insurance
            contributions become payable. He has not  provided,  either  in
            his own work history schedule or from other sources,  the  date
            he ceased employment in 1975  as  a  cook  assistant  with  the
            Metropolitan Police. Nor has he provided evidence  of  when  he
            started  employment  with  Davis  Trunking  as  an   electrical
            draughtsman. There is no evidence what his earnings were either
            hourly, weekly or monthly in either those jobs or the jobs that
            came after that (piping design draughtsman,  consultant  piping
            designer).


        12. Continuous employment requires employment to  be  continuous  -
            with allowance for holidays, sickness, compassionate leave  and
            similar.  I have no evidence before me whether Mr Fernandez Diz
            earned the sums he did over a few weeks and then did  not  work
            for months or whether his  earnings  reflect  work  done  every
            week. If I had been provided with evidence of average  earnings
            doing the jobs he did then  it  would  have  been  possible  to
            conclude whether those  earnings  were  from  short  bursts  of
            employment or were in fact from  continuous  employment.  Short
            bursts of employment are not continuous  employment  no  matter
            what the level of earnings. As it is, on  the  evidence  before
            me, the earnings figures produced do not,  on  the  balance  of
            probabilities, enable a conclusion to  be  drawn  that  he  has
            worked each week or month during the five year period. I do not
            know what the average earnings were for a person doing the jobs
            Mr Fernandez Diz was doing and am unable to find that the level
            of his earnings on which he is paying NI during those years  is
            reflective of continuous work or bursts of work.

        13. In reaching that conclusion  I  have  taken  into  account  the
            letter from the DWP. That letter summarises  the  facts  before
            them which they state includes that he has worked for a  period
            of 5 years and has not been out of the country for a continuous
            period of over 2 years. There is no reference in the letter  to
            the detailed evidence that was before the DWP on reaching  that
            decision which states that he

                  "has a right to reside in the UK and  can  be  treated  as
                  habitually resident from 26/9/14 because he has attained a
                  right of permanent  residence  as  defined  by  regulation
                  15(1)...."

        14. The wording of the letter  is  strange  because  it  refers  to
            26/9/14 as the date from which he acquired  habitual  residence
            because he had attained permanent residence. Yet as can be seen
            from the table of earnings above he was not working in the five
            years prior to 26/9/14 and there is no evidence to prove  that,
            although receiving Job Seekers Allowance, he was  doing  so  in
            the context of the Regulations such that  he  was  a  qualified
            person.  Habitual  residence  is  not  the  same  as  permanent
            residence. I of course accept that he has been working during a
            five year period but working during a five year period does not
            equate with working continuously for  five  years.  I  was  not
            provided with a copy of the State  Pension  Credit  Regulations
            2002 but Ms Turner said that they did not  refer  to  permanent
            residence but to habitual residence.  Although the decision  by
            the DWP refers to permanent residence I cannot be satisfied  on
            a balance of probabilities that they either have evidence  that
            shows that Mr Fernandez Diz  does  meet  the  requirements  for
            permanent residence under the Regulations or whether they  were
            simply satisfied that he met their habitual residence test.


        15. It may be that the DWP  had  evidence  which  enabled  them  to
            conclude that Mr Fernandez Diz met the 2006  Regulations;  that
            evidence was not before me and given the odd phrases in the DWP
            letter I cannot be satisfied that they applied their  minds  to
            the test that is  required  to  show  permanent  residence.  In
            accordance with the 2006 Regulations.

        16. It is of course  open  to  the  appellant  to  make  a  further
            application "filling in" the gaps in the evidence  but  as  the
            evidence stands before me I find that Mr Fernandez Diz does not
            meet the criteria for permanent  residence  and  therefore  the
            appeal of Mrs Fernandez Diz must be dismissed.

          Conclusions:

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.

     I set aside the decision

     I re-make the decision in the appeal by dismissing it.
