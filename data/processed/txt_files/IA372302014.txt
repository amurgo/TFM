                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
Appellant present; not represented
For the Respondent:    Mr A Webster, Advocate, instructed by the Advocate
                    General for Scotland


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of India, born on 2 August 1993.  He came to
    the United Kingdom as a student.  On 15 September 2014  the  respondent
    cancelled  his  leave  on  the  grounds  that  he  had  employed  false
    representations.  Information from the  English  Testing  System  (ETS)
    indicated that a false English language certificate had  been  used  as
    part of his application for leave to remain.

 2. The appellant appealed to the  First-tier  Tribunal  on  the  following
    grounds:

       . The decision is not in accordance with immigration law and rules;

       . The appellant has not  implied  any  false  representation  to  the
         respondent;

       . The decision is otherwise not incompatible (sic) with the ECHR;

       . The appellant sat in  the  test  himself  and  video  evidence  can
         confirm above contention;

       . No false documentation was submitted with an application.

 3. A panel of the First-tier Tribunal comprising Judge J C Grant-Hutchison
    and Judge A M S Green dismissed the appellant's appeal by determination
    promulgated on 7 January 2015.

 4. The appellant appeals to the Upper Tribunal on the following grounds:

         '[1]     Failure to Consider and  Apply  the  Correct  Standard  of
             Proof or a Requirement for Cogent Proof/Inadequate Evidence

             3)  The determination correctly identifies that the burden  of
                  proof is on the respondent to support the conclusion  that
                  the appellant has acted dishonestly.  However, it does not
                  or does not correctly determine the standard of proof that
                  should be applied, or whether cogent proof is required  in
                  order to prove dishonesty.

             4)  The  cases,  and  in  particular  RP  (proof  of  forgery)
                  Nigeria,  Waniku  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the   Home
                  Department [2011] EWCA Civ 264 at paragraph [20] per Moore-
                  Bick LJ together with the respondent's own policy (ch.  50
                  of the EIG, paragraph 50.12) support  the  view  that  the
                  Tribunal would require the  respondent  to  adduce  cogent
                  evidence of deception before a decision based on paragraph
                  321A of the Immigration Rules is taken.

             5)  It is clear that there was no such evidence adduced by the
                  respondent in the instant case.  The spreadsheet  evidence
                  that was adduced by the respondent that  related  directly
                  to the appellant suffered from a discrepancy, in  that  it
                  was not consistent with the ETS search document adduced by
                  the respondent.

             6)  In any event, the  respondent's  evidence  was  inherently
                  insulated from the Tribunal's forensic mechanisms  because
                  it  was  either  third  hand   hearsay   created   by   an
                  unaccountable foreign company, ETS, or hearsay evidence of
                  a generic type.  This was  not  sufficient  to  prove  the
                  serious allegation  made  against  the  appellant  by  the
                  respondent  in  this   case,   and   the   Tribunal   paid
                  insufficient regard to the hearsay nature of the  evidence
                  against the appellant.

         [2]      Unfairness: Article 6 of the ECHR

             7)  While the normal position is that Article 6 of the ECHR is
                  not engaged in immigration cases because  immigration  law
                  is administrative in nature, it is respectfully  submitted
                  that the instant appeal involved a criminal allegation and
                  therefore imports the protections imposed by Article 6  of
                  the ECHR to such matters.

             8)  The leading case with respect to whether an allegation  is
                  criminal in nature is Engle v Netherlands (No 1) (1976)  1
                  EHRR 647, in particular at  paragraph  82.   The  test  is
                  three-pronged, but each limb is not a necessary condition.
                   The three questions asked in Engle to  determine  what  a
                  charge is criminal are:

                  a)   What is the categorisation in domestic law?

                  b)   Is the offence one of general application?

                  c)   What is the severity of the penalty  imposed  on,  or
                      the result of, the allegation being established?

             9)  In  this  case,  the  allegation  against  this  appellant
                  implies a crime (fraud), but no criminal proceedings  have
                  been  brought.   The  notion  of  deception  is  generally
                  applicable; and the consequences for the appellant of  the
                  allegation of deception being made out are severe in  that
                  he is required to immediately forfeit his studies  in  the
                  UK and is subject to a bar on re-entry under part 9 of the
                  Immigration Rules the future.

             10) ... in light of these features of the case Article 6  ECHR
                  is engaged.  If that is so this supports  the  appellant's
                  contention that the standard of  proof  applicable  is  an
                  enhanced standard.  It also indicates that there has  been
                  a breach of Article 6(3)(d), namely to have  the  facility
                  to examine the witnesses relied upon against him,  because
                  of  the  willingness  of  the  Tribunal  to   accept   the
                  respondent's hearsay evidence against the appellant.'

 5. The respondent replied to the  grounds  of  appeal  under  Rule  24  as
    follows:

    '...

      3. Hearsay is admissible in the IAC, strict rules of evidence  do  not
         apply.  Any document issued by a third party, such  as  a  college,
         university or English test result can only be verified  as  genuine
         or false by the third party who issued it.  Such verification would
         by definition be hearsay but will probably fall under  one  of  the
         exceptions to the hearsay rule in civil proceedings given that  the
         third party is the only party which can verify it.

      4. The Tribunal had before it specific evidence of  that  verification
         as "invalid".  At paragraph  27  the  Tribunal  said  that  it  was
         satisfied with the provenance of the document (from ETS the English
         language test verifier) and that it identified the appellant.

      5. The suggestion that an "enhanced standard of proof"  is  applicable
         in all civil proceedings where deception is  alleged  goes  against
         well established authorities including B (Children), Re [2008] UKHL
         35 (11 June 2008).

      6. The tribunal at [27] accepted the specific evidence adduced by  the
         SSHD coupled with the  adverse  credibility  findings  against  the
         appellant arising out of cross-examination at [30],  the  SSHD  had
         made out its case of deception and providing a false document.  The
         appellant stated incorrectly when he took the English language test
         and was not believed as to why he allegedly took the test in London
         when he was living in Glasgow - 400 miles away.'

 6. The decision granting permission to appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal  was
    issued on 10 March 2015.  Notice of the hearing before us was issued on
    30 October  2015.   A  letter  on  file  from  the  appellant's  former
    representatives, dated and faxed on 16 November 2015, advises that they
    are no longer acting and that he will represent himself.

 7. The appellant told us that he depends on money which his  mother  sends
    him from India, but she was unable to send him money  recently  due  to
    family circumstances, and so he could not pay his lawyer.  He said that
    if he were given a few days, he would be able to do so.

 8. We decided that those circumstances did  not  justify  an  adjournment.
    The appellant has had ample time to prepare.  Also, the legal  argument
    was clear from the grounds.

 9. Mr Singh insisted to us that notwithstanding the  shortcomings  in  his
    evidence,  he  did  sit  the  test  to  obtain  his  English   language
    certificate.

10. On ground 1 and the question of  the  standard  of  proof,  Mr  Webster
    referred us to Scottish Ministers v Stirton and Anderson 2014  SC  218,
    [2013] CSIH 81.  He reminded us that the First-tier Tribunal may  admit
    evidence whether or not that evidence would be admissible  in  a  civil
    trial: Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Immigration etc) Rules
    2014, rule 14(2).  Such evidence includes hearsay.  The Civil  Evidence
    (Scotland) Act 1988 provides that in civil proceedings  evidence  shall
    not be excluded solely on the ground that it is hearsay,  and  provides
    also for admission  of  written  statements.   He  submitted  that  the
    further matters raised under ground 1 go only to the weight to be given
    to items of evidence, which was very much a matter for  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  The tribunal had  evidence  of  a  systematic  and  thorough
    investigation by the Secretary of State.  At  paragraph  31  the  panel
    reached its conclusions "on a balance of probabilities and taking  into
    account the strength, cogency and quality of the evidence".  The ground
    of appeal the well-justified adverse comments by the  panel  about  the
    appellant's own  evidence,  which  went  a  long  way  to  support  the
    conclusion that he did not sit the test.

11. On ground 2, Mr Webster submitted although the appellant says that  the
    leading case is Engle, that overlooks Maaouia v France [2001]  33  EHRR
    42, which decided that proceedings such as  the  present  do  not  fall
    within Article 6.

12. Mr Singh did not wish to reply to Mr Webster's submissions.

13. We reserved our determination.

14. In Scottish Ministers v Stirton and Anderson the Court said:

         Standard of proof.

         [117] It was conceded,  as  it  had  to  be,  that  the  applicable
         standard of proof is the balance of probabilities (POCA, s  241(3);
         Serious Organised Crime Agency v Gale [2011] 1 WLR 2760). There  is
         no intermediate or "heightened civil standard" (Mullan  v  Anderson
         1993 SLT 835; B v Scottish Ministers 2010 SC  472).  That  much  is
         clear. However, the reclaimers seek to qualify  the  position  with
         reference to the quality of evidence required  to  meet  the  civil
         standard in the circumstances of this case. The quality of evidence
         necessary to meet the standard of proof, whether that is the  civil
         or criminal standard, will depend on the circumstances of the case.
         Where the alleged facts are inherently improbable, it may  be  more
         difficult to prove that those facts are more probable than not.  It
         does not follow, however,  that  proof  of  unlawful  conduct  will
         necessarily fall into the category of inherent improbability.

         [118] Despite the somewhat opaque obiter dictum of Lord Morison  on
         the inherent unlikelihood that "a  normal  person"  will  commit  a
         serious crime  (Mullan  v  Anderson  (supra),  at  842),  proof  of
         unlawful or criminal conduct in civil  proceedings  does  not  fall
         into any special category. There is  no  presumption  that  serious
         criminality is inherently improbable  and  there  is  no  necessary
         connection  between  the  seriousness  of  an  allegation  and  its
         probability (In re S-B (Children) [2010] 1 AC 678 at 686, citing In
         re B (Children) (Care Proceedings: Standard of Proof) [2009] AC 11,
         Lord Hoffman at para 15, Lady Hale at para 73). Thus,

         "It would be absurd to suggest that the tribunal must in all  cases
         assume that serious conduct is unlikely to have occurred.  In  many
         cases, the other evidence will show that it was all too likely. If,
         for example, it is clear that a child was assaulted by one or other
         of two people, it would make no sense to start one's  reasoning  by
         saying that assaulting children is a serious matter  and  therefore
         neither of them is likely to have done so" (ibid).

         In all cases, the probability of the alleged conduct will depend on
         the whole circumstances of the case. Where the  principal  question
         is whether property was obtained through unlawful  conduct,  rather
         than  whether  the  reclaimers  themselves   have   committed   any
         particular  unlawful  act  on  any  particular  occasion  (POCA,  s
         242(1)), there is even less force in the  argument  that  a  higher
         degree of cogency, quality or  quantity  of  evidence  is  required
         according to the gravity of the allegations (Olupitan v Director of
         the Assets Recovery Agency [2008] Lloyd's Rep FC 253, Carnwath,  LJ
         at paras 22 - 24).

         [119]  The  court  has  no  difficulty  with  the  Lord  Ordinary's
         application (para [102]) of the appropriate standard of  proof.  In
         particular, a requirement that "there  must  be  stronger  evidence
         when the allegation is a serious one" (ibid, emphasis  added)  does
         not form part of the law for the reasons given. Such a ratio cannot
         be derived from the dicta of the Full Bench in  Mullan  v  Anderson
         (supra). That being  so,  it  is  sufficient  to  record  that  the
         judgment  of  the  United  Kingdom  Supreme  Court  in  In  re  S-B
         (Children) (Care Proceedings: Standard of Proof)  (supra)  reflects
         the existing position in Scotland and, insofar as it addresses  the
         application of the civil standard of proof, ought to be followed.

15. The grounds in this case were prepared by  an  English  barrister,  but
    that is little excuse for ignoring Scottish  Ministers  v  Stirton  and
    Anderson.  Certainly, the grounds should not have failed to observe  S-
    B.

16. The standard of proof is the balance of probability.

17. The rest of ground 1 is only disagreement with the findings reached  by
    the panel.  The panel had before it evidence of an invalid test  result
    linked to the appellant, as set out at paragraph 27 in particular.  The
    panel would have been entitled to decide as it did on the  respondent's
    evidence alone, had there been nothing else in the case; but the ground
    entirely  ignores  the  further  findings  based  on  the   appellant's
    evidence, which was counter-productive.  He said in his grounds that he
    could produce video evidence, but it was  never  forthcoming.   He  was
    unable to describe the location of test centre,  other  than  being  in
    London.   He said that he took the test in June or July 2013,  when  by
    the documentary record it was in February 2013.  There was no  rational
    explanation for taking the test in London, involving a lengthy journey,
    when he could easily have done so near his home in Glasgow, and he said
    he had to be careful with his financial outgoings.

18. Maaouia v France holds as follows:

         "33.     The Court notes, firstly, that  the  Government  have  not
         denied the existence of a dispute (contestation) within the meaning
         of Article 6 � 1. However, they  maintained  that  the  dispute  in
         question did not concern the determination of the applicant's civil
         rights or of a criminal charge against him, within the  meaning  of
         Article 6 � 1 of the Convention.

         34.      The  Court  points  out  that,  under  its  case-law,  the
         concepts of "civil rights and obligations"  and  "criminal  charge"
         cannot be interpreted solely by reference to the  domestic  law  of
         the respondent State. On several occasions, the Court has  affirmed
         the principle that these  concepts  are  "autonomous",  within  the
         meaning of Article 6 �  1  of  the  Convention  (see,  among  other
         authorities, the K�nig v. Germany judgment of 28 June 1978,  Series
         A no. 27, pp. 29-30, �� 88-89; the Baraona v. Portugal judgment  of
         8 July 1987, Series A no. 122, pp. 17-18, � 42; and the  Malige  v.
         France judgment of 23 September  1998,  Reports  of  Judgments  and
         Decisions 1998-VII, p.  2935,  �  34).  The  Court  confirms  those
         principles in the instant case, as  it  considers  that  any  other
         solution might lead to  results  that  are  incompatible  with  the
         object and purpose of the Convention (see,  mutatis  mutandis,  the
         Engel and Others v. the Netherlands judgment of 8 June 1976, Series
         A no. 22, p. 34, � 81, and the K�nig judgment cited above, pp.  29-
         30, � 88).

         35.      The Court has not previously examined  the  issue  of  the
         applicability of Article 6 � 1 to procedures for the  expulsion  of
         aliens. The Commission has been called upon to do so, however,  and
         has consistently expressed the opinion that the decision whether or
         not to authorise an alien to stay in a country of which he is not a
         national does not entail any determination of his civil  rights  or
         obligations or of  any  criminal  charge  against  him  within  the
         meaning of Article 6 � 1 of the Convention (see, for example, Uppal
         and  Singh  v.  the  United  Kingdom,  application   no.   8244/78,
         Commission decision of 2 May 1979, Decisions and Reports  (DR)  17,
         p. 149; Bozano  v.  France,  application  no.  9990/82,  Commission
         decision of 15 May 1984, DR 39, p. 119;  Urrutikoetxea  v.  France,
         application no. 31113/96, Commission decision of 5  December  1996,
         DR 87-B, p. 151; and Kareem v. Sweden,  application  no.  32025/96,
         Commission decision of 25 October 1996, DR 87-A, p. 173).

         36.      The Court points out that the provisions of the Convention
         must be construed in the light of  the  entire  Convention  system,
         including the Protocols. In that connection, the Court  notes  that
         Article 1 of Protocol No. 7, an instrument that was adopted on  22
         November 1984 and which France has  ratified,  contains  procedural
         guarantees applicable to the expulsion of aliens. In addition,  the
         Court observes that the preamble to that instrument refers  to  the
         need to take "further steps to ensure the collective enforcement of
         certain rights and freedoms by means of the Convention ...".  Taken
         together, those provisions show that the  States  were  aware  that
         Article 6 � 1 did not apply to  procedures  for  the  expulsion  of
         aliens and wished to take special measures  in  that  sphere.  That
         construction is supported by the explanatory report on Protocol No.
         7 in the section dealing with Article 1, the relevant  passages  of
         which read as follows:

             "6. In line with the general remark made in  the  introduction
             ..., it is stressed that an alien lawfully in the territory of
             a member state of the Council of Europe already benefits  from
             certain guarantees  when  a  measure  of  expulsion  is  taken
             against him, notably those which are afforded  by  Articles  3
             (prohibition of inhuman or degrading treatment) and  8  (right
             to respect for private and family life),  in  connection  with
             Article 13 (right to an effective  remedy  before  a  national
             authority) of the ... Convention ..., as  interpreted  by  the
             European Commission and Court of Human Rights ...

             7.   Account  being  taken  of  the  rights  which  are   thus
             recognised in favour of aliens, the present article  has  been
             added to the ... Convention ... in  order  to  afford  minimum
             guarantees to such persons in the event of expulsion from  the
             territory of a Contracting Party. The addition of this article
             enables protection to be granted in those cases which are  not
             covered by other international  instruments  and  allows  such
             protection to be brought within the purview of the  system  of
             control provided for in the ... Convention ...

             ...

             16. The European Commission of Human Rights has  held  in  the
             case of Application No. 7729/76 that a decision  to  deport  a
             person does 'not involve a determination of his  civil  rights
             and obligations or of any criminal charge against him'  within
             the meaning of  Article  6  of  the  Convention.  The  present
             article does not affect this interpretation of Article 6."

         37.      The Court therefore considers that by adopting  Article  1
         of Protocol No. 7  containing  guarantees  specifically  concerning
         proceedings  for  the  expulsion  of  aliens  the  States   clearly
         intimated their intention not to include  such  proceedings  within
         the scope of Article 6 � 1 of the Convention.

         38.      In the light of the foregoing, the  Court  considers  that
         the proceedings for the rescission of the  exclusion  order,  which
         form the subject matter of the present case,  do  not  concern  the
         determination of a "civil right" for the purposes of Article 6 � 1.
         The  fact  that  the  exclusion  order   incidentally   had   major
         repercussions on the applicant's private and family life or on  his
         prospects of employment cannot suffice to bring  those  proceedings
         within the scope of civil rights protected by Article 6 � 1 of  the
         Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, the Neigel v. France judgment of
         17 March 1997, Reports 1997-II,  pp.  410-11,  ��  43-44,  and  the
         Maillard v. France judgment of 9 June 1998, Reports  1998-III,  pp.
         1303-04, �� 39-41).

         39.      The Court further considers that orders  excluding  aliens
         from French  territory  do  not  concern  the  determination  of  a
         criminal charge either. In that connection,  it  notes  that  their
         characterisation  within  the  domestic  legal  order  is  open  to
         different interpretations. In any event, the domestic legal order's
         characterisation of a penalty cannot, by itself,  be  decisive  for
         determining whether or not the penalty is criminal in nature. Other
         factors, notably the nature of the penalty concerned,  have  to  be
         taken into account (see Tyler v. the  United  Kingdom,  application
         no. 21283/93, Commission decision of 5 April 1994, DR 77,  pp.  81-
         86). On that subject, the Court notes that, in  general,  exclusion
         orders are not classified as criminal within the member  States  of
         the Council of Europe. Such orders, which in most States  may  also
         be made by the administrative  authorities,  constitute  a  special
         preventive measure for the purposes of immigration control  and  do
         not concern the determination of  a  criminal  charge  against  the
         applicant for the purposes of Article 6 � 1. The fact that they are
         imposed in the context of criminal proceedings cannot  alter  their
         essentially preventive nature.  It  follows  that  proceedings  for
         rescission of such measures cannot be  regarded  as  being  in  the
         criminal sphere either (see, mutatis  mutandis,  Renna  v.  France,
         application no. 32809/96,  Commission's  decision  of  26  February
         1997, unreported).

         40.      The Court concludes that decisions  regarding  the  entry,
         stay and deportation of aliens do not concern the determination  of
         an applicant's civil rights or obligations or of a criminal  charge
         against him, within the meaning of Article 6 � 1 of the Convention.

         41.      Consequently, Article 6 �  1  is  not  applicable  in  the
         instant case."

19. In that light, ground 2 is also unsound.

20. If the criteria in Engle were to be applied, this case would still  not
    be classified as a criminal allegation.  Domestic law  categorises  the
    case within immigration  law,  not  criminal  law.   The  "penalty"  is
    cancellation of leave to remain, not a criminal sanction.

21. If Article 6 of the ECHR were engaged, the case  discloses  no  breach.
    The ground gives us no reason to think that the right of appeal to  the
    First-tier Tribunal is inconsistent with  the  right  to  "a  fair  and
    public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial
    Tribunal established by law."

22. The  appellant  was  not  deprived  of  the  facility  to  examine  the
    respondent's witnesses.  He did not apply for  citations  for  them  to
    attend the First-tier Tribunal, as he might have done under rule 15  of
    the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal)  (Immigration  etc)  Rules
    2014.

23. Neither of the appellant's grounds establishes any error of law by  the
    First-tier Tribunal.  Its determination shall stand.

24. No anonymity order has been requested or made.
