                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. In this appeal the Appellant is the Secretary of  State  for  the  Home
    Department and the Respondent is Mr Xiaosong Jin. For ease of reference
    however I shall refer to the Secretary of State as "the Respondent" and
    Mr Xiaosong Jin as "the Appellant".

History

 2. The Appellant who was born on 23rd  November  1973  is  a  national  of
    China. He is married to Manting Tao a woman who has indefinite leave to
    remain in the United Kingdom and  is  therefore  settled  and  resident
    here. The couple have one child, who is registered as a British citizen
    on 21st May 2013.

 3. On 28th July 2012, the Appellant applied for leave  to  remain  as  the
    spouse of a person present and settled in the UK. On  12th  March  2013
    the Respondent refused that  application,  under  Appendix  FM  of  the
    Immigration Rules because the Appellant  did  not  meet  the  financial
    requirements threshold.

 4. The Appellant appealed that decision and the appeal was heard by First-
    tier Tribunal  Judge  Shimmin  on  14th  August  2013.  The  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge, after hearing evidence from the Appellant, allowed  his
    appeal under both the Immigration Rules and Article 8 ECHR.  The  Judge
    took into account the Appellant's salary of �7,800 per  annum  and  net
    rental income of �10,800.  The  Judge  therefore  calculated  that  the
    Appellant's total gross annual income amounted to �18,600.

 5. Having allowed the appeal under the Immigration Rules  the  Judge  then
    went on in the alternative  to  consider  Article  8  ECHR,  and  after
    consideration allowed it under that provision as well.

 6. The Respondent sought and was granted permission to appeal. The grounds
    seeking permission claimed that the Judge had  misdirected  himself  in
    law when he had taken into account the rental income put forward by the
    Appellant.  The  grounds  pointed  out  that  this  was  an   incorrect
    calculation because, for rental income  to  count  as  income  for  the
    purposes of the Immigration Rules the person must own the property that
    is rented.  Further  there  must  be  specified  confirmation  of  such
    ownership.

 7. In the case before the Judge it appeared that the Appellant herself was
    renting the property from which he derived the rental  income.  He  was
    therefore subletting and  could  not  satisfy  the  conditions  of  the
    Immigration Rules.

 8. So far as  the  Article  8  aspect  of  the  Judge's  determination  is
    concerned, the grounds seeking permission submitted that for an  appeal
    to be allowed under Article 8 when the Rules are not satisfied,  it  is
    necessary for the  case  to  be  exceptional.  In  these  circumstances
    exceptional means circumstances in which although the  requirements  of
    the Rules have not been met, refusal would result in  an  unjustifiably
    harsh outcome. That was not the case here.

 9.  Permission  to  appeal  was  granted  by  First-tier  Tribunal   Judge
    Nightingale. In granting permission she said,

         "The grounds argue that the Judge erred  in  that  the  appellant's
         income was not evidenced in accordance  with  the  requirements  of
         appendix FM-SE and, consequently, the maintenance requirements were
         not met. It is also argued  that  the  Judge  ered  in  failing  to
         appreciate that "exceptional circumstances" were required to  allow
         an appeal on article 8 grounds where the rules were not met.

         For reasons which are unclear, neither representative addressed the
         Judge directly with regards to the requirements of  appendix  FM-SE
         A1(10) on specified evidence  of  maintenance.  It  ism  therefore,
         unsurprising that the Judge arguably fell into error, in regard  to
         the permissible sources of income set down in this lengthy part  of
         the rules, and the need for  documentation,  despite  an  otherwise
         careful and full consideration. This ground is  arguable,  but  the
         respondent must be aware that this appellant and his  wife  have  a
         British national child and, consequently,  EX1  may  apply  in  any
         event.

         Article 8 requires no 'exceptional circumstances'. Nonetheless, the
         Judge approached article 8 on the basis that the appellant met  the
         requirements of the rules and, in the alternative, that he did  not
         (paragraph 36 applies). There is little merit in the second ground,
         but the decision in Ferrer (limited appeal  grounds;  Alvi)  [2012]
         UKUT 00304(IAC) is followed and permission granted on  all  grounds
         argued".

10.  Thus the matter comes before  me  to  decide  whether  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge's determination discloses an error of  law,  and  if  it
    does, whether the decision requires to be remade.

11. The Appellant did not attend. Mr Hunt-Jackson attended on behalf of the
    Respondent. Mr Hunt-Jackson informed me that  he  did  not  expect  the
    Appellant to attend as he has now  been  granted  indefinite  leave  to
    remain in any event (under  the  Long  Residence  rule).  He  indicated
    however  that  he  had  been  instructed   to   pursue    this   appeal
    nevertheless. Mr Hunt-Jackson made submissions relying on  the  grounds
    seeking permission and asked that I allow the Respondent's  appeal  and
    remake the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  Judge,  dismissing  the
    Appellant's appeal.

Error of Law and Remaking the Decision

12. I am satisfied that the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    discloses an error of  law  in  his  approach  to  the  claimed  income
    threshold enjoyed by the Appellant. I am satisfied that the  Judge  has
    misdirected himself  by  taking  into  account  rental  income  from  a
    property which the Appellant himself was  renting  and  which  was  not
    owned by him in the specified manner. I am satisfied therefore that the
    Appellant cannot meet the financial  requirements  of  the  Immigration
    Rules. I do however endorse Judge Nightingale's remarks in the grant of
    permission, it would appear that neither representative  addressed  the
    Judge directly with regards to  the  requirements  of  Appendix  FM  on
    specified evidence of maintenance. I agree also  with  her  endorsement
    that it is unsurprising that the Judge fell into error in regard to the
    permissible sources of income set down in  this  lengthy  part  of  the
    Rules.

13. So far as the Article 8 consideration is concerned. I accept  that  the
    Judge approached Article 8 on the basis  that  the  Appellant  met  the
    requirements of the Rules and that resulted in an error. For an  appeal
    to be allowed under Article 8 when the Rules are not  satisfied  it  is
    necessary to show that there are some circumstances demonstrating  that
    the  Respondent's  refusal  would  result  in  an  unjustifiably  harsh
    outcome. Nothing demonstrating this was put before the  Judge.  He  did
    consider, under the proportionality test in Razgar that  the  Appellant
    and his spouse have a long and stable marriage  but  there  is  nothing
    unusual in that. He also considered the consequences of  separation  on
    the family as a whole and stated that it would  not  be  reasonable  to
    expect the Appellant's wife who has a British child to accompany him to
    China, but there was no evidence proffered to show why  this  would  be
    unjustifiably harsh.

14. This of course is all academic  now  in  view  of  the  fact  that  the
    Appellant has been granted indefinite leave to remain. Nevertheless for
    the purposes of this determination, the following decision is made.

DECISION

15. The First-tier Tribunal Judge having erred in  law,  I  set  aside  his
    decision. The decision is remade. The Appellant's  appeal  against  the
    Respondent's decision of 12th March 2013 is dismissed.

No anonymity direction is made
