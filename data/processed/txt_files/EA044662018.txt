Representation:
For the appellant:     Mr S. Bisson, instructed by PN Legal Services
For the respondent:    Mr S. Kotas, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    The appellant entered the UK on 30 September 2011 with leave to  enter
    as a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant, which was valid until 26 January
    2014. On 20 May 2013 the appellant applied  for  a  residence  card  to
    recognise a right of residence as the family member of an EEA national,
    which was  refused  on  13  September  2013.  The  First-tier  Tribunal
    dismissed a subsequent appeal because neither  the  appellant  nor  his
    claimed EEA national wife attended the hearing. There was  insufficient
    evidence to show that the appellant was the family  member  of  an  EEA
    national who was exercising EU treaty rights in the UK.

2.    The appellant appealed the respondent's subsequent decision  dated  14
    June 2018 to refuse to issue a residence card  recognising  a  retained
    right of residence as the former family  member  of  an  EEA  national.
    Despite the earlier First-tier Tribunal decision, the only reason given
    by the respondent for refusing this application was that the  appellant
    failed  to  produce  sufficient  evidence  to  show  that  he  met  the
    requirements  of  regulation  10(6)(a)  of  The  Immigration  (European
    Economic Area) Regulations 2016 ("the EEA Regulations 2016"). No  issue
    was taken with the credibility of the appellant's original claim to  be
    the family member of an EEA national  for  the  purpose  of  regulation
    10(5).

3.    First-tier Tribunal Judge M. Robertson  ("the  judge")  dismissed  the
    appeal in a decision promulgated on 18/04/19.  The judge noted that the
    only issue was "whether or not the appellant had been exercising Treaty
    rights since the date of the divorce, this being 18 October [2017].  If
    he was, and he was still exercising Treaty rights at the  date  of  the
    hearing, he would be entitled to succeed in his appeal." [13]

4.     The  judge  noted   the   submissions   made   by   the   appellant's
    representative that at the date of the application in February 2018 the
    appellant had only been able to provide a copy of his  tax  return  for
    the year 2016-2017 because the return for the year  2017-2018  was  not
    yet due. Since then the appellant had provided a copy of the tax return
    for 2017-2018 [14]. The judge considered the appellant's oral  evidence
    as to his income  in  both  tax  years.  She  was  satisfied  that  the
    appellant's oral evidence of his income in the 2016-2017 was consistent
    with the tax return. She was satisfied that  he  was  self-employed  as
    claimed in the 2017-2018 tax year and that he was self-employed at  the
    date the divorce was finalised [14].

5.    The judge turned to consider whether there was evidence to  show  that
    the appellant continued to earn a living as a self-employed  person  at
    the date of the hearing in  January  2019.  Again,  the  appellant  was
    unable to produce a tax return  for  the  year  2018-2019  because  the
    return was not yet due. The appellant confirmed that he was still self-
    employed and estimated his income to be around �5,000 at that stage  of
    the tax year [16]. The judge concluded:

         "19.      I  have  considered  the  evidence  and  the  submissions
             carefully. Mr Swaby is right to say that the only evidence  we
             have is the Appellant's oral evidence,  the  invoices  he  has
             provided at pp 360-455 and the letter  from  G&S  Accountants.
             The  Appellant's  evidence  is   not   independent   objective
             evidence; he has a vested  interest  in  the  outcome  of  the
             appeal; and where evidence is available, it should be provided
             (TK (Burundi)). G&S Accountants have recently  been  appointed
             but they had not in fact seen any evidence that the  Appellant
             has earned anything from  April  2018  to  date.  I  have  the
             invoices, but these do not state the addresses of the  persons
             named on the invoices, and there would be no way of  verifying
             that the work was in fact carried out. There are no  witnesses
             to confirm that he has provided any  services  to  them  on  a
             regular basis. There are no bank statements to show  that  the
             funds earned were  put  into  a  bank  account.  Finally,  the
             Appellant's estimate of how much he thought he had earned this
             year tax year was wholly inadequate; the invoices  add  up  to
             almost �13,000 by 8 November 2018,  which  is  well  over  the
             earnings in previous years. As the Appellant is the person who
             has done the work and  received  the  income,  I  find  it  is
             implausible that he would not have realised  that  he  had  in
             fact  earned  more  than  in  his  previous  years  of   self-
             employment. Although  it  is  established  as  fact  that  the
             Appellant has been self-employed in  previous  years,  I  find
             that on the totality of the evidence,  there  is  insufficient
             evidence before me to confirm  that  the  Appellant  is  self-
             employed as at the date of the hearing. He is not entitled  to
             a residence  card  because  he  has  not  provided  sufficient
             evidence to establish that he is self-employed as  claimed  as
             at the date of the hearing. The appropriate course  of  action
             for the Appellant, bearing in mind that it is  found  that  he
             was self-employed as claimed at the date of the divorce, is to
             submit a fresh application with the appropriate evidence."

6.     The  appellant  appeals  the  First-tier  Tribunal  decision  on  the
    following grounds:

    (i)    The judge erred as to the date when the appellant  was  required
         to show that he was self-employed for  the  purpose  of  regulation
         10(6)(a) of the EEA Regulations 2016.

    (ii)   The judge failed to  take  into  account  the  nature  of  self-
         employment  or  the  possibility  of  gaps  in  self-employment  in
         assessing whether the appellant met the relevant requirements.

Legal Framework

7.    Article 13  of  the  Citizens  Directive  (2004/38/EC)  sets  out  the
    circumstances in which family members may retain a right of residence.

         1. Without prejudice to the second subparagraph, divorce, annulment
             of the Union citizen's  marriage  or  termination  of  his/her
             registered partnership,  as  referred  to  in  point  2(b)  of
             Article 2 shall not affect the right of residence  of  his/her
             family members who are nationals of a Member State.

             Before acquiring the right of permanent residence, the persons
             concerned must meet the conditions laid down  in  points  (a),
             (b), (c) or (d) of Article 7(1).

         2. Without prejudice to the second subparagraph, divorce, annulment
             of marriage  or  termination  of  the  registered  partnership
             referred to in point 2(b) of Article 2 shall not  entail  loss
             of the right of residence of a Union citizen's family  members
             who are not nationals of a Member State where:

             (a)  Prior  to  initiation  of  the   divorce   or   annulment
             proceedings  or  termination  of  the  registered  partnership
             referred to in point  2(b)  of  Article  2,  the  marriage  or
             registered  partnership  has  lasted  at  least  three  years,
             including one year in the host Member State; ...

             Before acquiring the right of permanent residence,  the  right
             of residence of the persons concerned shall remain subject  to
             the requirement that they are  able  to  show  that  they  are
             workers or self-employed persons or that they have  sufficient
             resources for themselves  and  their  family  members  not  to
             become a burden on the social assistance system  of  the  host
             Member  State  during  their  period  of  residence  and  have
             comprehensive sickness insurance  cover  in  the  host  Member
             State, or  that  they  are  members  of  the  family,  already
             constituted in the host Member State, of a  person  satisfying
             these requirements. "Sufficient resources" shall be as defined
             in Article 8(4).

             Such family members shall  retain  their  right  of  residence
             exclusively on personal basis.

8.    Regulation 10 of the EEA Regulations 2016 is  said  to  transpose  the
    Citizens Directive. The relevant section is regulation 10(5)-(6).

         '(1)     In these Regulations, "family member who has retained  the
             right of residence" means, subject to paragraphs (8) and  (9),
             a person who satisfies a condition in paragraph (2), (3),  (4)
             or (5).

         ...

         (5)      The condition in this paragraph is that the person ("A")-

             (a) ceased to be a family member of a qualified person  or  an
                  EEA national with a right of permanent  residence  on  the
                  initiation of  proceedings  for  the  termination  of  the
                  marriage or civil partnership of A;

             (b) was residing in the  United  Kingdom  in  accordance  with
                  these  Regulations  at  the  date  of  the  initiation  of
                  proceedings for the termination;

             (c) satisfies the condition in paragraph (6); and

             (d) either-

                  (i)  prior to the initiation of the  proceedings  for  the
                      termination of the marriage or the civil partnership,
                      the marriage or civil partnership had lasted  for  at
                      least three years and the parties to the marriage  or
                      civil partnership had resided in the  United  Kingdom
                      for at least one year during its duration;

         ...

         (6)      The condition in this paragraph is that the person-

             (a) is not an EEA national but would, if the  person  were  an
                  EEA national, be a worker, a  self-employed  person  or  a
                  self-sufficient person under regulation 6; or

             (b) is  the  family  member  of  a  person  who  falls  within
                  paragraph (a).'

9.    In Baigazieva v  SSHD  [2018]  EWCA  Civ  1088  the  Court  of  Appeal
    concluded that a person needed to  show  that  they  met  the  relevant
    conditions of regulation 10(5)(a) at the date of the initiation of  the
    divorce proceedings and not the date the proceedings  were  made  final
    (decree absolute). This is consistent with the wording of Article 13 of
    the Citizens Directive and regulation 10(5)(a).

10.   In Gauswami (retained right of  residence:  jobseekers)  India  [2018]
    UKUT 00275 the Upper Tribunal considered what the correct date was  for
    the  overall  assessment  of  whether  a  person  retains  a  right  of
    residence. Although the Tribunal acknowledged that  what  was  said  in
    Baigazieva regarding regulation 10(5)(a) was correct, it concluded that
    the overall date when a person ceased to become  a  family  member  and
    thereby retained a right of  residence  is  the  date  the  divorce  is
    finalised. It is only at that point that a  person  ceases  to  be  the
    family member of an EEA national.  The  Upper  Tribunal  observed  that
    regulation 10(5)(a) and (b) use the past tense, but regulation 10(5)(c)
    and 10(6) are framed in the present tense.  The  Tribunal  went  on  to
    find:

         "33.     In order to understand the significance of this, one needs
             to refer to the text of Article  [13].  Article  [13(2)]  (a),
             (b), (c) and (d) set out requirements to be met  in  order  to
             retain  the  right  of  residence.  These   requirements   are
             essentially backward-looking in nature.  So  too,  as  we  now
             know, is the requirement regarding the status of the qualified
             person.

          34.     By contrast, the paragraph that follows sub-paragraph  (d)
             ("Before acquiring the right of permanent residence  ...")  is
             of a present or ongoing nature. This is because a  person  who
             retains the right  of  residence  has  to  be  a  worker/self-
             employed/self-sufficient  and  insured  person  (or  a  family
             member of such a person) at all times up to the point that  he
             or she acquires the right of permanent residence; that  is  to
             say, acquires a right  that  is  no  longer  retained  from  a
             previous relationship with a relevant EU  citizen.  In  short,
             the meaning of the words "Before acquiring ..." would  perhaps
             be better conveyed in English by saying "Until  the  right  of
             permanent residence has been acquired ...".

          35.     Regulation 10(6) is how the United Kingdom has decided  to
             give domestic legislative effect to that paragraph in  Article
             [13]. As will be seen, we conclude that regulation 10(6)  does
             not give proper or at least sufficiently clear effect to  that
             Article, so far as concerns what is meant by being a "worker".
             But, so far as its temporal aspect  is  concerned,  regulation
             10(6) is entirely right. So far as the appellant is concerned,
             the requirements of that provision must be satisfied  both  on
             and after the date of  the  decree  absolute."  [typographical

Decision and reasons

11.   The evidence before the judge showed that the  appellant  entered  the
    UK on 30 September 2011 with leave to  enter  as  a  Tier  4  (General)
    Student Migrant, which was valid until 26 January 2014.

12.   The  evidence  included  a  copy  of  a  marriage  certificate,  which
    indicated that Muhammad Naeem Khan married Agnes Kocsandi, a  Hungarian
    national, on 06 November 2012.  There  were  four  unclear  photocopied
    photographs of the couple on what appeared to be their wedding day  and
    another five grainy photographs of them together or with friends.

13.   The bundle before the First-tier Tribunal also included some  evidence
    to suggest that they  might  have  been  living  at  the  same  address
    together after the marriage. Confirmation of Ms Kocsandi's registration
    on the electoral register was sent to an address in Kitchener  Road  in
    High Wycombe on 19 April 2013. A Thames Water bill  dated  24  December
    2013 covering a period from 08 September  2013  was  addressed  to  the
    appellant at the same address. A copy of the appellant's Santander bank
    statement from 01 March 2013 to 01 April 2013 was addressed to  him  at
    Kitchener Road.

14.   The evidence also included a copy  of  a  12-month  tenancy  agreement
    signed by Mr Khan and Ms Kocsandi on 30 November 2013 for a property in
    Desborough Avenue in High Wycombe. A letter from Jobcentreplus was sent
    to the appellant at the address on  06  January  2014.  A  copy  of  Ms
    Kocsandi's  counterpart  driving  licence  recorded  the  same  address
    although the document is undated. The appellant and  Ms  Kocsandi  were
    named on Thames Water bills for  the  property  at  Desborough  Avenue,
    which covered a period from January 2014 to July 2015.  Copies  of  the
    appellant's Santander bank statements were sent to the same address and
    covered the period from December 2013 to September 2016.

15.   On 20  May  2013  the  appellant  applied  for  a  residence  card  to
    recognise a right of residence as the family member of an EEA national.
    The application was refused on  13  September  2013.  No  copy  of  the
    Secretary of State's decision appeared to be in the bundle  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal. However, the reasons for refusal  were  summarised
    by First-tier Tribunal Judge Thorne who heard an  appeal  on  23  April
    2014. The Secretary  of  State  refused  the  application  because  the
    passport in Ms  Kocsandi's  name  was  reported  lost  or  stolen.  The
    Secretary of State was not satisfied that he  was  married  to  an  EEA
    national.

16.   Neither the appellant nor Ms  Kocsandi  attended  the  hearing  before
    Judge Thorne. The judge noted that their statements  were  undated  and
    had similar wording. The appellant claimed that  Ms  Kocsandi  reported
    the loss of her passport and applied for a new passport. By the time he
    applied for a residence card she had found the old  passport  at  home.
    The old passport was mistakenly sent with the  application  instead  of
    her new passport. The judge was satisfied that the appellant  had  been
    notified of the hearing and that he  could  proceed  to  determine  the
    appeal in his absence. He concluded that the witness statements were of
    little evidential value. The appellant  signed  a  statement  that  was
    undated and purported to confirm, incorrectly, that he was  a  national
    of India when he is a Pakistani national. In any event, the judge found
    that the explanation provided by the appellant for  submitting  an  EEA
    passport that had been reported lost or stolen "makes no sense  and  is
    lacking  in  credibility."  In  addition,  the  judge  found  that  the
    appellant failed  to  produce  sufficient  evidence  to  show  that  Ms
    Kocsandi was exercising EU treaty rights. Limited evidence was produced
    relating to her employment in the UK. The appeal  was  dismissed  in  a
    decision promulgated on 07 May 2014.

17.   The appellant's evidence in his witness  statement  was  that  divorce
    proceedings were initiated on 24 February 2016. A copy  of  the  decree
    absolute showed that the divorce was finalised by the Family  Court  in
    Bury St Edmunds on 18 October 2017.

18.   At the point when the appellant submitted the most recent  application
    for a residence card he had never been issued  with  a  residence  card
    recognising a right of  residence  as  the  family  member  of  an  EEA
    national. A decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  cast  doubt  on  the
    credibility of the appellant's claim to rights of residence as a family
    member.

19.   Having outlined the background to  the  most  recent  application,  we
    note that,  despite  the  credibility  issues  previously  raised,  the
    Secretary of State did not refuse the application made on  23  February
    2018 on the ground that the appellant failed to meet  the  requirements
    of regulation 10(5) because the marriage was one  of  convenience.  The
    bundle before the First-tier Tribunal contained a certified copy of  Ms
    Kocsandi's Hungarian passport issued on 21 March 2013, which was  valid
    for 10 years. A statement purporting to be from Ms Kocsandi was  signed
    and dated on 07 November 2017. In that statement she said that she  was
    willing to provide the original passport if necessary. The only  reason
    given for refusing the application was that  the  appellant  failed  to
    produce sufficient evidence to show that he  met  the  requirements  of
    regulation 10(6)(a) to  show  that,  even  though  he  is  not  an  EEA
    national, if he were, he was a worker, self-employed person or a  self-
    sufficient person.

20.   We turn to consider the grounds of appeal. The first point relates  to
    the temporal assessment made by the judge. Regulation 10(5)(a) is to be
    assessed at the date of the  initiation  of  divorce  proceedings.  The
    Secretary of State did not  dispute  this  element  of  the  regulation
    despite  the  earlier  credibility  findings  made  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

21.   We learn from Gauswami that the assessment of regulation 10(6)  should
    be at the date when the divorce is finalised up until the date when the
    person acquires a right of permanent residence. It was correct for  the
    First-tier Tribunal to consider whether there was evidence to show that
    the appellant was likely to be a worker at the  date  the  divorce  was
    finalised. If the evidence is taken at its highest, at  that  point  he
    ceased to be the family member of an EEA national. However, it did  not
    necessarily follow that the judge had to consider whether he was  still
    a worker at the date  of  the  hearing.  Article  13  of  the  Citizens
    Directive and regulation 10(6)(a) only required the appellant  to  show
    that he continued to work until he acquired permanent residence. Once a
    person acquires permanent residence it is not necessary  to  show  that
    they continue to be a worker.  Nothing  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal's
    findings indicate that  the  judge  appreciated  that  this  assessment
    needed to be carried out.

22.   In order to acquire a  permanent  right  of  residence  the  appellant
    would need to show that he had resided in the UK in accordance with  EU
    law for a continuous period of five years. In  the  period  before  the
    divorce was finalised he would need to show  that  he  was  the  family
    member of an EEA national who was exercising rights of free movement in
    the UK. After the divorce he would need to show that  he  continued  to
    work.

23.   The bundle before the First-tier Tribunal  included  quite  a  lot  of
    evidence relating to Ms Kocsandi's employment in the UK, but most of it
    related to work carried out from 2015 onwards. The evidence relating to
    her employment before then was limited. It included the letter dated 14
    May 2013 from Ms Kocsandi's purported employer, which was given  little
    weight by Judge Thorne in 2014.

24.   However, an SA302 dated 13 November 2017  outlined  the  HMRC  records
    for Ms Kocsandi's income from the tax years 2013-2014 to 2016-2017.  It
    was accompanied by HMRC tax calculations for the  same  tax  years.  In
    2012-2013 the HMRC had no record of income  from  employment  or  self-
    employment. In the year 2013-2014 HMRC records showed that Ms  Kocsandi
    declared �7,680 profit from self-employment. For the 2014-2015 tax year
    she declared self-employed  income  of  �7,890.  Her  income  from  all
    employments was only �2,632 in 2015-2016. She declared a  total  income
    of �8,946 from employment and self-employment for the year 2016-2017.

25.   In the absence  of  any  allegation  that  the  marriage  was  one  of
    convenience,  there  was  evidence  before  the   First-tier   Tribunal
    indicating that the appellant had been the  family  member  of  an  EEA
    national since the marriage on 06 November 2012. However, there was  no
    evidence to show that Ms Kocsandi was exercising  her  rights  of  free
    movement as a worker until the  tax  year  2013-2014.  There  was  some
    evidence to suggest that she continued to work until  the  end  of  the
    2016-2017 tax year. Copies of her bank statements  indicated  that  she
    continued to receive payments for employed work until the end of  2017,
    which covered the period when the divorce was finalised.

26.   The letter  from  HRMC  dated  13  November  2017  indicated  that  Ms
    Kocsandi began work for Extract Cleaning Services on 06 April 2013  and
    ended work for them on 31 May 2014. There was evidence to show that she
    continued to work on an employed or self-employed basis until  the  end
    of 2017. By the date the divorce was  finalised  in  October  2017  the
    evidence indicated that the appellant had been  living  in  the  UK  in
    accordance with EU law for a period of four and a half years.  He  only
    needed to show that he continued to work for another six  months  after
    the date of the divorce to acquire a right of permanent residence.

27.   The  judge  was  satisfied  that  the  appellant  produced  sufficient
    evidence to show that he was self-employed  during  the  2017-2018  tax
    year. In the absence of any allegation that the appellant was  not,  in
    fact, a family member prior to the divorce, on the evidence before  the
    First-tier Tribunal, it was at least more  likely  than  not  that  the
    appellant had acquired a right of permanent residence by April 2018.

28.   Once the appellant had acquired a right  of  permanent  residence,  it
    was not necessary for him to show that he continued to work at the date
    of the First-tier Tribunal hearing in January 2019  because,  based  on
    the judge's findings regarding his self-employment during the 2017-2018
    tax year, he had already acquired permanent residence.

29.   Although the judge was correct to consider the position  at  the  date
    of the divorce, it follows from our analysis that she erred in focusing
    her subsequent assessment on whether there was evidence  to  show  that
    the appellant was a worker at the  date  of  the  hearing  rather  than
    considering whether the evidence indicated that he had already acquired
    a right of permanent residence.

30.   For these reasons, we conclude that the First-tier  Tribunal  decision
    involved the making of an error on a point of law. The decision is  set
    aside. The analysis of the evidence we  have  undertaken  in  order  to
    determine whether there was an error of law determines the  appeal.  If
    the appellant acquired a right of residence by April  2018  the  appeal
    must be allowed.

31.   The decision breaches the appellant's rights under the EU treaties  in
    respect of entry to or residence in the UK.
