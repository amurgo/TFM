                             DECISION ON APPEAL

Mr T Vanhegan (counsel instructed by Gulbenkian Harris Andonian) for the
appellant
Mr G Phillips for the respondent

   This is an appeal from  a  decision  of  an  adjudicator  (Ms  Sarvanjan
   Kaler), sitting at Barnet on 10 April, dismissing an  asylum  and  human
   rights appeal by a citizen of Kosovo. Leave was given on the basis  that
   the adjudicator had needed to consider, under article  8  of  the  Human
   Rights Convention, the situation of the appellant and her family in this
   country, as well as what awaited them on return. We  were  astounded  to
   see  that  the  grounds  of  appeal,  though  clearly  drafted  by   the
   appellant's solicitors (a well-known firm with two very experienced part-
   time adjudicators in the partnership) appeared in handwritten form. This
   is  not  acceptable  in  the  21st  century  from  anyone  providing   a
   professional service: any repetition is likely to be  reported,  through
   the Immigration Services Commissioner, to the Office for the Supervision
   of Solicitors.

2. The unusual features of the case were, starting with the less so:

   a) The family had been here ever since 1999,  at  first  by  dint  of  an
      asylum claim by this appellant's husband, finally dismissed on  appeal
      on 22 November 2001; now he is named as a dependant on her claim. They
      have two children, Stiven, born in Kosovo in March  1997,  and  Kelly,
      born here in January 2001.

   b) The appellant was raped, as the adjudicator accepted, by Serb soldiers
      in Kosovo in April 1999; but her husband does not know about that, and
      she is afraid of the consequences if he were to find out.

3. The adjudicator dealt with the article 8 issues arising as follows:

   17. Mr Merrylee questioned the Appellant in detail about how it was that
      her husband did not know about the rape, since he would have asked  to
      have sexual intercourse after  his  return  from  the  mountains.  The
      Appellant's explanation was that she told him she was  in  pain  after
      the attack on her. The Appellant places great importance  on  how  her
      husband would react if he knew about the rape,  and  it  would  appear
      that she has managed to hide this from her. The Appellant's mother-in-
      law knew, and I asked her why the mother-in-law did not shun her.  The
      Appellant's explanation was that  she  felt  sympathy  since  she  had
      witnessed the incident.  The  actions  of  the  mother-in-law  do  not
      indicate to me that she would tell other people about  this  incident,
      bearing in mind the shame that is attached to this. I do not  find  it
      credible that the mother-in-law, who was the  only  witness  to  these
      events, would have spread the story of the rape  of  her  daughter-in-
      law. It follows that I do not find it likely the husband would be told
      about these events on the family's return to Kosovo. I do  not  accept
      the story about the brief telephone Convention, in which the rape  was
      not mentioned.

   ...

   23. [bis] The Article 8 argument has been raised at the  first  time  at
      the hearing. The Respondent has had no notice  of  this,  but  I  have
      nevertheless given consideration to the arguments put  forward  by  Mr
      Merrylee. The Appellant's husband would leave her with  the  children,
      and  she  would  be  ostracised  and  ill-treated  by   the   civilian
      population.

  24. Lord Phillips in Ahsan Ullah and Thi Lien Do (2002 EWCA Civ 1856)  in
      the Court of Appeal at paragraph 64:

      Where the Convention is invoked on the sole ground of the treatment to
      which an alien, refused the right to enter or remain, is likely to  be
      subjected  by  the  receiving  state,  and  that  treatment   is   not
      sufficiently severe to engage Article 3,  the  English  court  is  not
      required to recognise that any other Article of the Convention is,  or
      may be engaged. Where such treatment falls outside  Article  3,  there
      may be cases which justify the grant of exceptional leave to remain on
      humanitarian grounds.

  25. Even if the Appellant is right, and her husband would  discover  that
      she had been raped, I would have to be persuaded that he would act  in
      a hostile manner towards her, leave her and take  away  the  children.
      She has not said that she fears physical violence. When she  described
      her behaviour, the only hint of violence was his  hitting  the  doors.
      This in itself does not show a tendency to violence.

  26. If he did leave his wife and take away  the  children,  this  is  not
      treatment that the Appellant would be subjected to  by  the  receiving
      state. There are too many imponderables. What I have  to  consider  is
      what is reasonably  likely  to  happen,  and  if  the  state  has  any
      obligations to prevent this. Firstly, I do not think  it  likely  that
      the husband will discover his wife has been raped. Secondly, there  is
      a possibility that he would leave her, just as there is a  possibility
      that he would not. The report of Dr  Steer  states  that  the  husband
      shows features of but is not  a  diagnosis  of  Post-Traumatic  Stress
      Disorder. He suffers from mild depression. He is  not  undergoing  any
      treatment that would be interrupted. He would no doubt be  upset,  and
      in his state would still want the support of his  wife.  Even  if  the
      husband did leave the Appellant, that is not a matter that would place
      the UK authorities in breach of their obligations under Article 8.

  27. As to the Appellant's treatment from third parties, the evidence does
      not support her assertion that she would face persecution  because  of
      her ethnic origin. If she is shunned because she has been  raped,  and
      her husband did know about this, then she could move to another  area,
      either with or without her husband. This may be harsh, but that is not
      the test that I have to consider. The UK government would  remove  the
      whole family. It is not their act that would result in a separation of
      the family. Nor would it be because of any action or inaction  by  the
      receiving state. To return her would not be in breach of her Article 8
      rights since neither state is  responsible  for  the  predicament  she
      would find herself in.

4. The grant of leave no doubt referred to the  recent  decision  in  Razgar
  [2003] EWCA Civ 840, making it clear that the main issue in an article  8
  appeal was likely to be on  the  difference  between  whatever  treatment
  someone was getting here and in their  receiving  country.  There  is  no
  evidence that the appellant is getting any treatment  here;  Mr  Vanhegan
  told us that it was under discussion, following the recommendations of Mr
  D Hughes, who describes himself as a  "Psychoanalytic  and  Intercultural
  Psychotherapist", apparently aiming to take up some middle ground between
  psychologists  and  "country  experts".   He   mentions   a   number   of
  qualifications, including an MSc in Intercultural Psychotherapy: although
  he says he has lived and worked "in a variety of contexts in Europe,  the
  Middle East and Africa", there is no suggestion that he has ever  visited
  Kosovo. However there is no question of removal depriving  the  appellant
  of anything she is currently getting by way of treatment.

5. On  point a) (see 2), the family's length of residence here has  resulted
  in  their  settling  in  to  the  typical  existence  described  in   the
  appellant's current statement:

 8.    As I stated above, my life mainly revolves around my  family.  Apart
    from my husband I have two children. My son is now 6.5 years old and in
    Year Three at Hither Green Primary School. He is well settled there and
    doing excellently. His friends are English and he  regards  himself  as
    English. He speaks English fluently with a London accent and prefers to
    speak English at home rather than Albanian.  His  social  life  centres
    around his school friends, going to Birthday parties and playing in the
    park after school and at weekends. He is just like  any  other  English
    kid, he likes Beckham and regards this country as his home.  After  4.5
    years here it would be almost impossible for him to go to Kosovo.

 9.   My daughter was born here and is nearly 3 years old. She  is  due  to
    start school next January and for her too it would be almost impossible
    to return now.
6. While we certainly need to consider the situation  of  the  family  as  a
  whole, it is by no means irrelevant that it has been brought about by the
  use - we will not say exploitation - of  the  appeals  system,  following
  illegal entry by the appellant and her husband, with Stiven. Mr  Phillips
  did not challenge the passage we  have  quoted  as  a  picture  of  their
  current family life, nor do we have any reason to doubt it, so far as the
  facts are concerned. When it comes to the  conclusions,  however,  it  is
  otherwise. While Stiven has no doubt settled well into school, he is only
  in his second year, and it is absurd to suggest that he  could  not  also
  settle down into another system: as we pointed out to Mr Vanhegan, few in
  eastern Europe start as early as five. It is clear from what is expressed
  as his preference that neither he nor Kelly has been brought up unable to
  speak Albanian: words begin to fail us when it is suggested that a three-
  year old child, not yet at school, could not possibly adapt to conditions
  in the land of her mother tongue.

7. If there is any feature of this case that could justify  overturning  the
  adjudicator's very thorough and well-argued  decision,  it  must  be  the
  effect of point b), the  results  of  the  appellant's  history  becoming
  known. Mr Vanhegan's main point against her on that was that she had  not
  taken account of the conclusions of Mr Hughes, and the evidence to  which
  he refers. Of course he did not blame her  as  such  for  not  doing  so,
  because this was something which (to use Henry Read's famous line) in her
  case she did not have. Nevertheless he said we should look at it all, and
  exercize the well-known advantages of hindsight.

8. We queried with Mr Vanhegan whether the decision of the Court  of  Appeal
  in Oleed [2002] EWCA Civ  1906  allowed  us  to  do  that,  unless  first
  satisfied that the adjudicator was clearly wrong on the  evidence  before
  her; but we made it clear that we  should  consider  his  submissions  on
  their merits, whatever view we took  on  that.  In  the  end,  a  further
  decision of the Court of Appeal became  available  shortly  after,  which
  clarifies the approach to be  taken  by  the  Tribunal  to  adjudicators'
  decisions. It is Indrakumar [2003] EWCA Civ 1677: while it is a  decision
  of only two judges (Hale and Carnwath LJJ), the subsequent  elevation  of
  Hale LJ may be thought to add to its authority. We regard it as now clear
  that, when it comes to drawing inferences, the Tribunal is free to do so,
  if there is any error by  the  adjudicator,  on  the  basis  of  all  the
  evidence put before us.

9. So we turn to the adjudicator's primary reason for  rejecting  point  b),
  which is to be found in her � 17. She may arguably  have  been  wrong  to
  take the view (in her �� 26 - 27, set out above), on the basis of  Ullah,
  that the result of the appellant's husband finding  out  about  the  rape
  would not engage article 8, as not being the fault of either the  sending
  or receiving state. The passage from Ullah she cited at � 24  deals  with
  things that are said to be the fault of the receiving state; but  in  any
  case, if the appellant were likely to be in a serious  predicament  as  a
  result of her husband finding out, then any lack of protection  from  the
  consequences by the receiving state might have  to  be  considered  under
  article 8. However, if the adjudicator was right in her findings of  fact
  at � 17, then she did not need to go on to consider this question; nor do
  we need to express a decided view on it. She was of course quite right to
  deal with the case on all arguable bases; but she made it quite clear  at
  � 25 that the rest were all alternatives ("even if") to the  main  reason
  for her decision.


10. The piece of evidence with which the adjudicator was dealing at � 17  is
  set out by her at � 8: in April 1999, while the appellant's  husband  was
  away, seven Serb soldiers came to their house and four of them raped both
  her and her mother-in-law:

  Her mother-in-law told her not to tell her husband since  this  was  very
  shameful and he may divorce her. She had not told her husband about  this
  event to this day. She had briefly spoken to a friend in Kosovo over  the
  telephone who knew about the rape, and she assumed that her mother-in-law
  had told her. Her husband would be bound to  find  out  if  she  were  to
  return to Kosovo, and would leave her taking the children. He would react
  even more severely now because she had hidden matters from him.

11. Mr Vanhegan criticized, as meaningless in context, the last sentence  of
  the adjudicator's � 17 ("I do  not  accept  the  story  about  the  brief
  telephone Convention, in which the rape was not mentioned.) However,  one
  only has to look back, as we pointed out, at her � 8, to see that she was
  perfectly well aware that the appellant was claiming that  the  rape  was
  mentioned in the telephone conversation, which indeed was the whole point
  of anything being said about it in evidence. Looking at the last sentence
  of � 17 as a whole, it is clear from "Convention" for "conversation" that
  it has not been properly proof-read: no doubt the typist by now was  more
  used to dealing with the former than the latter. The adjudicator  however
  had just given a perfectly logical reason for not accepting the  evidence
  that the friend had mentioned the rape. She may well be accused of  being
  rather careless in checking her typescript; but not  of  misunderstanding
  the case before her.

12. Mr Vanhegan's other criticism of the adjudicator's findings at � 17  was
  that they were reached without the background evidence referred to by  Mr
  Hughes, or his own views on it. The  reason  the  adjudicator  had  given
  however was this:

  The actions of the mother-in-law do not indicate to  me  that  she  would
  tell other people about this incident, bearing in mind the shame that  is
  attached to this. I do not find it credible that the  mother-in-law,  who
  was the only witness to these events, would have spread the story of  the
  rape of her daughter-in-law.

  Quite obviously the adjudicator was only too well aware  of  the  general
  cultural background to which we have  been  referred.  It  was  precisely
  because of the shame attached to the rape that she  reached  the  finding
  she did. Further discussion of the details of that traditional background
  adds nothing to its rightness or wrongness. The more shameful it is for a
  woman to be raped, the less likely it will be for her  to  reveal  it  to
  anyone. While she might be more likely to tell  another  woman  about  it
  than a man, there is nothing to show any  particularly  close  connection
  between the appellant's mother-in-law and her friend.  It  must  also  be
  remembered that the mother-in-law had herself been raped.

13. It was for the adjudicator to make up her  mind  whether  the  telephone
  conversation had ever taken place: this was a primary finding of fact  on
  oral evidence, tested by the adjudicator, with which we  should  be  very
  slow to interfere, even if we were inclined (which we are not) to take  a
  different view. There is nothing  else  in  the  background  evidence  or
  elsewhere to show that the adjudicator was wrong  on  this  part  of  her
  findings. There is nothing without the  telephone  conversation  to  show
  that either the mother-in-law or the appellant had  ever  revealed  their
  rapes to anyone else in Kosovo, or why the mother-in-law should do so, or
  the appellant find any need to do  so  there  in  future.  Although  what
  happened has played a large part in the appellant's case in this country,
  she never mentioned it from the time she arrived here in  1999  till  she
  completed her own statement of  evidence  form  on  30  April  2002.  Her
  husband was not present before the adjudicator or us, and in any case  is
  said to speak very little English:  at  her  request,  no  copy  of  this
  decision will be sent to their house.

14. We see no reasonable challenge  to  the  adjudicator's  conclusion  that
  there was no real risk (assuming in the appellant's favour that  this  is
  also the test in article 8 appeals of this  kind)  of  her  husband  ever
  finding out that she (or his own mother) had been raped. It follows  that
  no article 3 case can succeed. Returning to article 8,  we  have  already
  seen (at 6), that the point a) factors are favourable; but they cannot be
  regarded as so exceptional as on their own to overturn the  adjudicator's
  decision on. Even in Shala [2003] EWCA Civ 233, a case of similar  length
  of residence, as it happens by persons  from  the  same  territory,  this
  required the very special feature that the Home Office had failed to deal
  with the original claim in reasonable time, which would have ensured  its
  success under the policy then in force. That is not the case here,  where
  the present claim was not made till over two years  after  the  appellant
  arrived here, at a time  when  her  husband's  appeal  had  already  been
  dismissed. We see no reason to interfere with the adjudicator's  decision
  on article 8 either.
