For the Respondent:    Mr S Whitwell, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The Appellant, a national of India, date of  birth  18  December  1985,
    appealed against the Respondent's decision dated 1 June 2017 to  refuse
    an application for leave to remain.  His appeal came before  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge J C Hamilton who, on 8 August 2018, dismissed his appeal
    on all grounds.  Permission to appeal was given on 5 November 2018.  As
    a result of representations made, it  has  been  properly  accepted  on
    behalf of the Secretary of State that at the material date, relevant to
    the  Judge's  decision,  the  requirements  in  relation  to  temporary
    absences from the United Kingdom were  in  fact  different  from  those
    applied by the Judge.  In all other respects there is no real challenge
    to the fact that by amended grounds the issue of the five year  partner
    route in Appendix FM was to be considered.  It was plainly the  subject
    of evidence before the Judge and submissions made by the parties.   The
    Judge in what might be described, as marginally ambiguous, set out [D29-
    33] the extent to which the five year route as submitted  was  arguably
    met, although it had not been the subject of an actual  fresh  decision
    or amended decision by the Secretary of State prior to the hearing.

2.   The Judge concluded having made comments about the question of  whether
    the Appellant had complied with Appendix FM-SE in relation to specified
    documents, nevertheless had before him evidence that went to show  what
    the earnings of the Sponsor and the Appellant were and was able to make
    an informed decision, which he did on the basis as follows:-

         "I have therefore proceeded on the basis that the Appellant is able
         to meet the financial requirements of the Rules on the  basis  that
         he and his wife (the Sponsor) between them are easily able to  earn
         in excess of the required threshold.  There were  no  other  issues
         evidently arising under the five year partner route which militated
         against that appeal succeeding."

3.   Mr Whitwell has identified the possibility that maybe there is more  to
    the specific evidence and/or earnings issues, but he left it to  me  to
    determine whether there is enough evidence to deal with the appeal.   I
    was satisfied that the Original Tribunal made an error of law.   I  was
    satisfied that  all  the  Judge's  findings  should  stand.   In  those
    circumstances, whilst there was a material  I  decided  to  remake  the
    decision in the context of the submitted evidence and the findings made
    by the Judge.  There was, quite simply,  in  the  relatively  long  and
    detailed decision provided by Judge Hamilton, the evidence and material
    needed to reach a concluded view on the issues.  I find that there  was
    sufficient evidence to show that the Appellant discharged the burden of
    proof upon  a  balance  of  probabilities  that  he  met  the  relevant
    requirements of the Rules in relation to the five year partner route.

4.   In the light of Mostafa [2015] UKUT 00112, overtaken to a degree by  TZ
    (Pakistan) [2018] EWCA Civ. 1109, this is  a  case  where  the  correct
    outcome was that the appeal should have succeeded.  The compliance with
    the Rules on a balance of probabilities  was  not  dispositive  of  the
    issue under Article 8 ECHR For my own part and in any event  it  seemed
    to me that it was appropriate in the light of the  case  law  that  the
    appeal should be allowed: Albeit since this is  a  human  rights  based
    appeal, I do so under the provisions of Article 8 ECHR being  satisfied
    that those protected rights family/private life  rights  were  engaged,
    that the Respondents' decision was an interference,  the  decision  was
    lawful  and  properly  served  the  purposes  of  the  maintenance   of
    immigration control.  It was not argued,  in  the  above  circumstances
    that the Respondent's decision was proportionate. For my  own  part,  I
    found, considering this matter and the evidence through  the  prism  of
    the immigration  rules  that  the  public  interest   was  not  adverse
    affected, the Appellant and sponsor are able and willing  to  integrate
    and well able to be a productive part of British society. They will not
    be a burden on the taxpayer.  There are no other  general  grounds  for
    refusal. I find the Respondent's decision is disproportionate.

5.   For my part, in my judgement, I am satisfied that this is one of  those
    few cases, particularly looked at through the prism of the  Immigration
    Rules, which indicates that it is one of the few which  should  succeed
    on Article 8 ECHR grounds, not least in the context of the decision  of
    the Court of Appeal in TZ.

NOTICE OF DECISION

6.   I substitute the decision for  that  of  the  Original  Tribunal.   The
    appeal is allowed on Article 8 ECHR grounds.

7.   No anonymity direction was made, nor was one was sought.

Signed                                  Date 16 January 2019

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

In this case a fee award is made in the sum of ï¿½140.00  because  the  issue,
not originally dealt with by the Secretary  of  State,  was  raised  in  the
amended grounds. It was raised at the hearing and  the  grounds  of  refusal
maintained, not least driven in part by an error which the parties  made  as
to the correct date to be addressed.
