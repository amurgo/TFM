For the Appellant:     Mr A Malik, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr M Diwnycz, HOPO

                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant has been granted permission to  appeal  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Mitchell dismissing her  appeal  against  the
    decision of the respondent refusing to grant her leave to remain in the
    UK on the basis of her family life  in  the  United  Kingdom  with  her
    partner, AM and her two children born in the United Kingdom on 19 April
    2014 and 20 February 2015.

2.   In the decision dated 19 October 2015, the respondent did not  consider
    that evidence had been provided to show that the children were  British
    citizens or that the appellant had been living with her partner/husband
    in a relationship akin to marriage for two years prior to the  date  of
    the application.   The  respondent  did  not  also  consider  that  the
    appellant had provided any information to suggest  that  she  had  sole
    responsibility for the children or that the  children  live  separately
    from the other parent.

3.   The respondent has now accepted that the appellant's partner and  their
    two children are British citizens.

4.   The judge found that the facts of this case were not  substantially  in
    dispute.  The appellant arrived in the UK in April 2004 as  the  spouse
    of a settled person.  She left that person after a  claimed  period  of
    domestic violence.  She met AM on 28 June 2013 and  they  began  living
    together.  They have two children who were born in the UK on  19  April
    2014 and 20 February 2015.  The appellant is a national of  Bangladesh.
    The appellant and her partner went through a Muslim marriage on 28 June
    2013.  The appellant's husband attended court and gave  oral  evidence.
    He is a driver.  It was not claimed that their  income  was  enough  to
    meet  the  ï¿½18,600  financial  requirements  of  Appendix  FM  of   the
    Immigration Rules.

5.   The judge accepted that evidence has been provided  to  show  that  the
    children are British citizens and that the appellant  and  her  British
    partner have been living together in a relationship  akin  to  marriage
    for over two years.

6.   The judge noted that the children in this case  are  not  7  years  yet
    though they have just embarked upon the education  system.   The  judge
    said it is clear that the Immigration Rules consider that  seven  years
    is a period after which it becomes less reasonable to consider that the
    appellant and her children should leave the United Kingdom.  There  are
    though significant advantages which cannot be ignored as  the  children
    are British citizens.

7.   The judge held that it was not suggested that the  appellant  would  be
    in need of international protection as a lone woman in Bangladesh.  She
    is not an unmarried woman and has a Muslim husband now.  He found  that
    the  evidence  does  not  support  that  the   appellant   would   face
    insurmountable obstacles as a lone  woman  or  that  she  has  suffered
    significant periods of domestic violence which  has  changed  her  very
    demeanour adversely affecting of vulnerability.

8.   The judge found that considering  the  age,  the  nationality  and  the
    period they have spent in the UK, and the health of the children and of
    the appellant, it has not been shown that it would not be reasonable to
    expect the children to leave the United Kingdom with the appellant.

9.   Considering Section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration  Act
    2009, the judge found that it would be in the  best  interests  of  the
    children to remain with both  parents.   It  is  the  decision  of  the
    parents as to whether the children would travel to Bangladesh or remain
    in the UK.

10.  The judge noted  that  the  appellant's  partner/husband  was  born  in
    Bangladesh though he has lived in the UK for the majority of his  life.
    He does not have any relatives in Bangladesh.  He has not claimed  that
    he cannot speak a relevant language of Bangladesh.

11.  The judge considered that  the  sins  of  the  parents  should  not  be
    visited upon the child.  He found however that the appellant  has  used
    the immigration system to her advantage.  She has breached  immigration
    law by overstaying.  There was no suggestion that the  appellant  would
    have or have had any recourse to public funds.  It was clear that their
    immigration history means that any private life developed in that  time
    was whilst their immigration status was precarious.

12.  Having considered the evidence the judge concluded that  the  appellant
    had not shown that it would not be reasonable for the children to leave
    the  United  Kingdom.   He  found  that  there  do  not  appear  to  be
    insurmountable obstacles to the appellant continuing  her  relationship
    with her partner outside  the  United  Kingdom  either.   He  concluded
    therefore that the appellant has  not  shown  that  she  can  meet  the
    Immigration Rules.

13.  The judge then went on to consider Article 8  outside  the  Immigration
    Rules.  For the same reasons the judge found that the family are living
    together in a subsisting genuine relationship and that any decision  to
    remove the appellant and the consequences following that removal  would
    potentially engage Article 8 for the  purposes  of  this  appeal.   The
    family would not be removed as a family unit.  The decision  to  remove
    the appellant from the UK would effectively be a breach of their family
    life.

14.  The judge said it is a primary consideration for him  to  consider  the
    best interests of the children.  He said all the family appears  to  be
    fit and healthy.  The children are clearly young enough to adapt  to  a
    new environment.

15.  The judge found that the appellant has been in the UK  long  enough  to
    establish a private and family life in the UK.  The decision to  remove
    the appellant from the UK is in accordance  with  the  law  and  has  a
    legitimate aim.  He has  though  concluded  that  the  interference  is
    proportionate to that legitimate aim.  The  appellant  is  the  primary
    carer for both children, but she cannot meet the Immigration Rules  for
    the reasons he had already given.  And it has not been shown that there
    would be very substantial difficulties or exceptional circumstances  or
    unjustifiable harshness for the appellant or any members of the family.

16.  The judge held that the effect of  removal  would  potentially  have  a
    significant effect on the children's education and family  and  private
    life; the appellant's daughter would be left without her mother  at  an
    important time in her development.  The overall effect  does  make  the
    decision disproportionate.  The  judge  considered  the  reasonableness
    test set out in Rule 276ADE, Article 8  applications  engaging  Section
    117B(6) and paragraph EX.1.1 of Appendix FM to the  Immigration  Rules.
    He concluded that it was reasonable to expect the  appellant  to  leave
    the UK.  He also concluded that it would be reasonable  to  expect  the
    children to leave the UK.

17.  Permission was granted to the appellant on the basis that  the  grounds
    raised arguable issues as to the judge's assessment of "reasonableness"
    in relation to the children, in particular  given  the  development  in
    relevant jurisprudence including KO (Nigeria) and Others v Secretary of
    State for the Home Department (Respondent) [2018] UKSC 53.

18.  Mr Malik submitted that the judge materially erred in  law  in  failing
    to consider KO (Nigeria) which was a decision in the public  domain  at
    the time the judge heard the case.  Mr Diwnycz accepted that the  judge
    made no mention of KO (Nigeria) which is a Supreme Court decision.   He
    submitted that KO (Nigeria) has been endorsed in a recent  decision  by
    the Upper Tribunal in JG (s 117B(6): "reasonable to leave"  UK)  Turkey
    [2019] UKUT 00072 (IAC) Rev 1.

19.  In the light of the argument made by the  parties,  I  found  that  the
    judge materially erred in law by failing to consider  KO  (Nigeria)  in
    his consideration of whether it was reasonable to  expect  the  British
    born children to leave the  United  Kingdom  with  their  mother.   The
    judge's decision cannot stand.  I set it aside and re-make it.

20.  Mr Malik relied on a decision by the Court of Appeal  in  AB  (Jamaica)
    [2019] EWCA Civ 661 which he said endorsed JG  and  KO  (Nigeria).   He
    said at paragraph 19 of AB (Jamaica) the  Court  of  Appeal  held  that
    since the conditions in 117B(6) had been met, no further examination of
    the public interest was required.

21.  In this case the appellant's two children  are  British  born  children
    and their father is a British citizen.  Section 117B(6) of the 2002 Act
    states as follows:

         "In the case of a person who is  not  liable  to  deportation,  the
         public interest does not require the person's removal where -


         (a)      the person has a genuine and subsisting relationship  with
             a qualifying child, and


         (b)      it would not be reasonable to expect the  child  to  leave
             the United Kingdom".


22.  I find that Section 117B(6)(a) of the 2002 Act is met in the  light  of
    the judge's finding that the family, that is the appellant, her husband
    and the two children, are living together in a subsisting  and  genuine
    relationship.  The children are British and  are  qualifying  children.
    The judge's  finding  means  that  the  appellant  has  a  genuine  and
    subsisting relationship with her two qualifying children.

23.  I also find that  Section  117B(6)(b)  is  met  in  the  light  of  the
    findings made by the judge.  The  judge  held  that  the  sins  of  the
    parents should not be visited  upon  the  children.  The  children  are
    rather young.  The judge  held  that  the  children  have  spent  their
    formative years in the UK.  He also held that the appellant's  children
    are clearly largely reliant upon her for their day-to-day needs at this
    moment.  I find that it is not likely that the appellant's husband, who
    is a driver, will be able to meet the day-to-day needs of the  children
    should the appellant be removed to Bangladesh.

24.  In JG the Upper Tribunal cited paragraph 33  of  the  judgment  of  the
    Supreme Court in ZH (Tanzania)  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2011] UKSC 4 which said:

         "In this case, the countervailing considerations were the  need  to
         maintain firm  and  fair  immigration  control,  coupled  with  the
         mother's appalling immigration history and  the  precariousness  of
         her position when family life was created.  But,  as  the  Tribunal
         rightly pointed out, the children were not to be blamed for that".

25.  In JG the Upper Tribunal held in its head note:

         "Section 117B(6) of the Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act
         2002 requires a court or Tribunal to hypothesise that the child  in
         question would leave the United Kingdom, even if this is not likely
         to be the case, and ask whether it would be  reasonable  to  expect
         the child to do so".


26.  I find on the evidence in this case that it would not be reasonable  to
    expect the two British children, who are young, in the formative  years
    and who rely on their mother for their day-to-day care  and  needs,  to
    leave the United Kingdom.

27.  Accordingly, I allow the appellant's appeal.

28.  An anonymity direction is made.


Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  her  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
