                                                                   Claimants

Representation:

For the claimants:     Ms E Greenwood, instructed by G Singh Solicitors
For the appellant:     Mr D Clarke, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The claimants, Olalekan Olufolahanmi Adebambo, date of  birth  30.9.74,
    and his wife, Adetokunbo Gladys Adebambo, date of  birth  29.5.79,  are
    citizens of Nigeria.

 2. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Wellesley-Cole promulgated  2.3.15,  allowing
    the claimants' appeals against the decisions of the Secretary of State,
    dated 19.5.14, to refuse their applications for leave to remain in  the
    United Kingdom outside the Immigration Rules on the basis of article  8
    ECHR private and family life.  The Judge heard the appeal on 12.2.15.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge Reid granted permission to appeal on 30.4.15.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 2.7.15 as  an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. For the reasons set out herein I find that there are such errors of law
    in the making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal that is should
    be set aside and remade.

 6. An issue arose at the First-tier Tribunal  as  to  whether  there  were
    valid appeals in relation to the children, in particular Pauldavid, the
    subject matter of most of the First-tier Tribunal decision. As  in  the
    First-tier Tribunal, the  representative  of  the  Secretary  of  State
    accepted that as the children are minors, they are  dependants  of  the
    parent claimants and thus their circumstances had to be  considered  as
    part of the appeal.

 7. It was common ground that the claimants could not meet the requirements
    of the Immigration Rules and thus the judge went on to consider article
    8 ECHR outside the Rules. Ultimately, the judge reached the  conclusion
    that the claimants' private  and  family  life  rights  outweighed  the
    legitimate aim of the state so as to find that the removal of the child
    Pauldavid, and thus also the removal of his parents  and  baby  sister,
    would be disproportionate.

 8. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Reid found it arguable that the
    judge's reasoning, particularly at �20 of the decision, is  lacking  in
    clarity in the article 8 proportionality balancing exercise between the
    claimants' private and family rights and the public interest  in  their
    removal taking into  account  the  public  interest  considerations  of
    section 117B of the 2002 Act.

 9. I find that the grounds of appeal rightly complain that the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge made material misdirections and  erred  in  law  in  the
    application of section 117B of the 2002 Act. In particular, it  appears
    that the judge gave positive credit in the  proportionality  assessment
    to factors that do not engender positive credit, such as the ability to
    speak English and not being a burden on the tax payer. It is  submitted
    in the grounds that the family is not financially independent, as  they
    are heavily reliant on public services to which they are  not  entitled
    and have been working illegally in the  UK.  Further,  the  wording  of
    section 117B(3) requires the person to  be  at  that  time  financially
    independent, not that they might be in the future if allowed to remain.



10. I find that the judge failed to  have  proper  regard  for  the  public
    interest considerations including those under section 117B of the  2002
    Act, a view now reinforced by the recent decision in AM (S 117B) Malawi
    [2015] UKUT 0260 (IAC). The claimants' continued presence in the UK  is
    unlawful. The first claimant has overstayed for many years.  They  have
    no right to remain in the UK and cannot meet  any  of  the  Immigration
    Rules for leave to do  so.  They  have  chosen  to  have  children  and
    effectively attempt to settle in the UK when they should have left  the
    UK. Article 8 is not a shortcut to compliance with  Immigration  Rules,
    which provide a route for settlement and is the  Secretary  of  State's
    proportionate response to article 8 private and family life claims. The
    immigration status of the claimants in the UK  was  always  precarious,
    thus little weight should be accorded to any private life developed  in
    the  UK.  Further,  little  weight  should  to  be  accorded   in   the
    proportionality balancing exercise  to  both  any  private  life  or  a
    relationship with a partner developed when they were unlawfully present
    in the UK. The immigration history of the parents  is  appalling.  They
    deliberately did not leave the UK when they should have done.

11. A further error is disclosed in �20 by  the  judge's  reliance  to  the
    claimant's credit in the proportionality balancing  exercise  that  the
    claimants are able speak English and will be in the future  financially
    independent. As AM made  clear,  a  claimant's  human  rights  are  not
    improved and cannot accrue 'credit' for such matters: "An appellant can
    obtain no positive right to a grant of  leave  to  remain  from  either
    s117B (2) or (3), whatever the degree of his fluency in English, or the
    strength of his financial resources." The test in section  117B  is  of
    present financial independence, not some speculative future aspiration.
    No credit ought to have been accorded to the  illegal  working  of  the
    parents and the fact that they may have paid council tax (but  did  not
    pay income tax on illegal earnings) cannot be properly said to stand in
    their favour in the proportionality assessment. I reject Ms Greenwood's
    submission that the judge only raised these issues so as  to  eliminate
    them as negative factors. To the contrary, it is quite clear  from  the
    wording of the decision that they were being assessed as factors in the
    claimants' favour.

12. Neither can the claimants acquire any positive  benefit  by  reason  of
    their immigration history, as held in Nasim & Ors  (Article  8)  [2014]
    UKUT 00025 (IAC): "A person's human rights  are  not  enhanced  by  not
    committing criminal offences or not relying on public funds.  The  only
    significance  of  such  matters  in  cases   concerning   proposed   or
    hypothetical removal from the UK is to preclude the Secretary of  State
    from pointing to any public interest justifying removal, over and above
    the basic  importance  of  maintain  a  firm  and  coherent  system  of
    immigration control."

13. I also fail to comprehend why the judge considers at �20 that the  fact
    that Pauldavid is "dependent on medical services,  as  he  has  been  a
    patient since birth," is a factor to be associated with the  fact  that
    the parents speak English in the claimants' favour. I find the  wording
    of this paragraph curious and difficult to follow. Towards the  end  of
    this paragraph the judge acknowledges some of the factors relied on the
    representative of the Secretary of State, but appears to simply dismiss
    them by stating, "but private life has  been  established  and  it  was
    already agreed they have family life, but these are all  factors  which
    by virtue of section 117B suggest that refusal is  not  in  the  public
    interest in this case." This  sentence  makes  no  sense  at  all.  The
    reasoning in this crucial paragraph is somewhat muddled  and  does  not
    justify the conclusion reached. It  follows  that  the  proportionality
    assessment is flawed by reason of inadequate and deficient treatment of
    section 117B public interest considerations. In the circumstances,  the
    submission that the judge failed to accord  sufficient  weight  to  the
    public interest in removal of the claimants is also well-founded.

14. I also find that the judge erred in assessing the best interests of the
    children, particularly Pauldavid, by  failing  to  follow  the  correct
    approach set out in the current case law guidance. In  Azimi-Moyed  the
    Upper Tribunal in considering the case law  in  relation  to  decisions
    affecting children identified the following principles to assist in the
    determination of appeals where children are affected  by  the  appealed
    decisions:
         "i) As a starting point it is in the best interests of children  to
         be with both their parents and if both parents  are  being  removed
         from the United Kingdom then the starting point  suggests  that  so
         should dependent children who form part of their  household  unless
         there are reasons to the contrary.
         ii)  It is generally in the interests  of  children  to  have  both
         stability and continuity of social and  educational  provision  and
         the benefit of growing up in the cultural norms of the  society  to
         which they belong.
         iii)  Lengthy residence in a country other than the state of origin
         can lead to development of social  cultural  and  educational  ties
         that it would be  inappropriate  to  disrupt,  in  the  absence  of
         compelling  reason  to  the  contrary.  What  amounts  to   lengthy
         residence is not clear cut  but  past  and  present  policies  have
         identified seven years as a relevant period.
         iv)  Apart from the terms of  published  policies  and  rules,  the
         Tribunal notes that seven years from age four is likely to be  more
         significant to a child than the first seven  years  of  life.  Very
         young children are focussed on  their  parents  rather  than  their
         peers and are adaptable.
         v)  Short periods of residence, particularly ones without leave  or
         the reasonable expectation of  leave  to  enter  or  remain,  while
         claims are promptly  considered,  are  unlikely  to  give  rise  to
         private life deserving of respect in  the  absence  of  exceptional
         factors. In any event, protection of  the  economic  well-being  of
         society amply justifies removal in such cases."

15. In Zoumbas v SSHD, the fact that the children were not British citizens
    and thus had no right to future education and health care  in  the  UK,
    together with the assessment of other factors, did not  create  such  a
    strong case for the children that their interest in remaining in the UK
    could have outweighed the considerations on which  the  Home  Secretary
    had relied in striking the balance  in  the  proportionality  exercise.
    There was in that case no irrationality in the conclusion that  it  was
    in the children's best interests  to  go  with  their  parents  to  the
    Republic of Congo.

         "No doubt it would have been possible to have  stated  that,  other
         things being equal, it was in the best interests  of  the  children
         that they and their parents stayed in the UK  so  that  they  could
         obtain such  benefits  as  health  care  and  education  which  the
         decision-maker recognised might be of a higher standard than  would
         be available in the Congo. But other things were  not  equal.  They
         were not British citizens. They had no right  to  future  education
         and health care in this country. They were  part  of  a  close-knot
         family with highly educated parents and were of an age  when  their
         emotional needs could only be fully met within the immediate family
         unit. Such integration as had occurred in  UK  society  would  have
         been predominantly in the context of the family unit." It was  also
         stated that it was legitimate for the decision-maker to ask herself
         first whether it  would  have  been  proportionate  to  remove  the
         parents if they had no children, and then, in considering the  best
         interests of the children  in  the  proportionality  exercise,  ask
         whether their well-being altered that provisional balance."

16. In EV (Philippines) v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 974, at  �58  the  Court  of
    Appeal held that the assessment of the best interests of  the  children
    must be made on the basis that the facts are as they are  in  the  real
    world:

         "If one parent has no right to remain, but the other  parent  does,
         that is the background against which the assessment  is  conducted.
         If neither parent has  the  right  to  remain,  then  that  is  the
         background against which the  assessment  is  conducted.  Thus  the
         ultimate question will be: is it reasonable to expect the child  to
         follow the parent with  no  right  to  remain  in  the  country  of
         origin?"

17. The Court of Appeal gave guidance that:

          "a decision as to what is in the best interests of  children  will
         depend on a number of factors such as (a) their age; (b) the length
         of time that they have been here; (c) how long they  have  been  in
         education; (c) what stage their education has reached; (d) to  what
         extent they have become distanced from the country to which  it  is
         proposed that they return; (e) how renewable their connection  with
         it may be; (f) to what extent they will have linguistic, medical or
         other difficulties in adapting to life in that country; and (g) the
         extent to which the  course  proposed  will  interfere  with  their
         family life or their rights (if they have any) as British citizens.

         "In a sense the tribunal is concerned with how emphatic  an  answer
         falls to be given to the question: is it in the best  interests  of
         the child to remain? The longer the child has been here,  the  more
         advanced (or critical) the stage of his education, the  looser  his
         ties with the country in question, and  the  more  deleterious  the
         consequences of his return, the greater the weight that falls  into
         one side of the scales. If it is overwhelmingly in the child's best
         interests  that  he  should  not  return,  the  need  to   maintain
         immigration control may well not tip the balance. By contrast if it
         is in the child's best interests to remain,  but  only  on  balance
         (with some factors pointing the other way), the result may  be  the
         opposite.

         "In the balance on the other side there  falls  to  be  taken  into
         account the strong weight to be  given  to  the  need  to  maintain
         immigration control in pursuit of the economic  well-being  of  the
         country and the fact that, ex hypothesi,  the  applicants  have  no
         entitlement to remain. The immigration history of the  parents  may
         also be relevant e.g.  if  they  are  overstayers,  or  have  acted
         deceitfully."

18. The Court of Appeal pointed out at �60 that the facts of the case  were
    a long way from those of ZH (Tanzania):

          "In our case none of the family is a British citizen. None has the
         right to remain in this country. If  the  mother  is  removed,  the
         father has no independent right  to  remain.  If  the  parents  are
         removed, then it is entirely reasonable to expect the  children  to
         go with them. As the immigration judge found  it  is  obviously  in
         their best interests to remain with their parents. Although it  is,
         of course a question of fact for the Tribunal, I  cannot  see  that
         the desirability of being educated at public expense in the UK  can
         outweigh the benefit  to  the  children  of  remaining  with  their
         parents. Just as we cannot provide medical treatment for the world,
         so we cannot educate the world."

19. At �61, the Court continued,

         "In fact the immigration judge weighed the best  interests  of  the
         children as  a  primary  consideration,  and  set  against  it  the
         economic well-being of the country. As Maurice Kay LJ  pointed  out
         in AE (Algeria) v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 653, at  [9]  in  conducting
         that exercise it would have been appropriate to consider  the  cost
         to the public purse in providing education to  these  children.  In
         fact that was not something that the immigration  judge  explicitly
         considered. If anything, therefore, the immigration  judge  adopted
         an approach too favourable to the appellant."

20. In my view a very similar observation can be  made  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge in the present case. The best interests of both children
    are obviously to remain with their  parents.  None  of  the  family  is
    British and they have no right to reside, be  raised,  receive  medical
    treatment, or be educated in the UK.  The  extensive  medical  services
    accessed in the UK means that they have  already  been  a  considerable
    burden to the public purse. The  approach  adopted  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal does  not  take  any  satisfactory  account  of  these  highly
    relevant factors.

21. All in all, I find that the decision failed to  amount  to  a  properly
    balanced proportionality assessment; it appears to  have  been  heavily
    weighted in favour of the claimants  and  somewhat  dismissive  of  the
    weight of the public interest in removal. Whilst  those  factors  which
    can properly be regarded as in favour of the claimants should certainly
    have been taken into account, including the evidence as to the  medical
    needs of Pauldavid, and whether necessary treatment would be  available
    outside the UK. However, the other factors, those in favour of removal,
    should not have been  left  out  of  account,  or  accorded  the  scant
    consideration and weight the way  the  decision  is  drafted  suggests.
    Whether it is described as being too favourable to  the  claimants,  or
    insufficiently cognisant of the factors in favour of removal is no more
    than two sides of the same coin.  The  imbalance  in  the  decision  is
    sufficient and significant so as to render the decision flawed  and  in
    error of law, requiring it to be set aside and remade.

22. When a decision of the First-tier Tribunal has been set aside,  section
    12(2) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 requires either
    that the case is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal  with  directions,
    or it must be remade by the Upper Tribunal. The scheme of the Tribunals
    Court and Enforcement Act 2007 does not assign the function of  primary
    fact finding to the Upper Tribunal. Where the facts are  unclear  on  a
    crucial issue at the heart of an appeal, as  they  are  in  this  case,
    effectively there has not been a valid determination of  those  issues.
    The errors in the making of the First-tier  Tribunal  decision  vitiate
    all other findings of fact and the conclusions from those facts so that
    there has not been a valid determination of the issues in the appeal.

23. In all  the  circumstances,  at  the  invitation  and  request  of  the
    claimants to relist this appeal for a fresh hearing in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, notwithstanding the likely delay that will be  occasioned,  I
    do so on the basis that this is a case which falls squarely within  the
    Senior President's Practice Statement at paragraph 7.2. The  effect  of
    the error has been to deprive the Secretary of State of a fair  hearing
    and that the nature or extent of any judicial  fact  finding  which  is
    necessary for the decision in the appeal to be re-made  is  such  that,
    having regard to the overriding objective in rule 2 to deal with  cases
    fairly and justly, I find that it is appropriate to remit  this  appeal
    to the First-tier Tribunal to determine the appeal afresh.

Conclusions:

24. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should  be
    set aside.

     I set aside the decision.

                    I remit the decision in the  appeal  to  the  First-tier
                    Tribunal to be remade afresh.

Consequential Directions

25. The appeal is to be relisted at the earliest date available  at  Taylor
    House, with an estimate of 2 hours;

26. No interpreter is required;

27. No later than 7 working days before the appeal  hearing  the  claimants
    must lodge with the Tribunal and serve on  the  Secretary  of  State  a
    single, indexed, paginated bundle containing all evidence on which  the
    claimants wish to rely, including further and up to date evidence as to
    their family circumstances;

28. If it is contended that appropriate or necessary medical treatment  for
    the child Pauldavid is not available in  Nigeria,  the  claimants  must
    produce independent objective evidence on that issue.



Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The outcome of the appeal remains to be decided.
