Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms R Popal, Counsel instructed by S Satha & Co
For the Respondent:    Mr P Duffy, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

      1. This matter comes  before  me  to  determine  whether  there  is  a
         material error of law in the decision of First-tier Tribunal  Judge
         O'Keeffe promulgated on 9 September 2016 ("the Decision").
      2. The background to the appeal before this Tribunal is amply set  out
         in my decision promulgated on 17 February 2017 and I do not propose
         to repeat it.  The matter came back before me on 26 April 2017 when
         I again adjourned it, first because there was no interpreter booked
         to permit the First Appellant to  give  oral  evidence  and  second
         because the Respondent sought to obtain a report from the  National
         Document  Fraud  Unit  ("NDFU")  concerning  the  letter  dated  19
         December 2014 on which the Appellants rely.  That  letter  purports
         to grant the First Appellant indefinite leave to remain.   I  refer
         to that letter hereafter as "the Grant Letter".


      3. In short summary, the  Appellants'  grounds  before  this  Tribunal
         focus on the Grant Letter and  aver  that  the  Respondent,  having
         granted the First Appellant indefinite leave to remain by the Grant
         Letter, is not entitled to withdraw that grant and,  as  a  result,
         the Appellants should be entitled to leave to  remain  in  the  UK.
         The complaint made in  relation  to  the  Decision  is  that  Judge
         O'Keeffe failed to have regard to that evidence.


      4. The matter has come before me on two occasions previously.  On  the
         first, I expressed concerns about  the  genuineness  of  the  Grant
         Letter for reasons set out at [6] of my decision promulgated on  17
         February 2017.  On the second, as I note above, I  adjourned  again
         in order to allow the Respondent to obtain a report from NDFU.   By
         an e-mail dated 29 June 2017, Mr Duffy informed me  that  NDFU  was
         not in a position to provide a report as to the authenticity of the
         Grant Letter.  That did not surprise me since the letter is  simply
         that; there is no security marking or other feature on  which  NDFU
         would be able to comment.  He did however provide me with further e-
         mails concerning the purported author of  the  Grant  Letter  which
         supplemented the evidence previously supplied in  relation  to  the
         author of the Grant Letter,  the  records  relating  to  the  First
         Appellant's case and the Respondent's policy  in  relation  to  the
         grant of leave at the time of the Grant Letter.


      5. I do not need though to deal with any of that  evidence  since,  at
         the  outset  of  this  hearing,  Ms  Popol,  now  Counsel  for  the
         Appellants, informed me that they no longer assert that  the  Grant
         Letter is genuine.  Again, I am unsurprised by that concession  not
         least since the First Appellant's own statement dated 2 March  2017
         refers at [7] to the Grant Letter as  being  "a  letter  supposedly
         headed by the Home Office" (my emphasis).  It  appears  that,  even
         before the latest evidence from the Respondent, the First Appellant
         entertained doubts as to the authenticity of the Grant Letter.


      6. I permitted Ms Popol to make submissions which were largely matters
         of evidence. She did so, however, with the consent of Mr Duffy  who
         indicated that, due to the content of her submissions, there was no
         need to cross-examine the First Appellant.
      7. Ms Popol informed me that, prior to instructing S Satha &  Co,  the
         Appellants had instructed a person named Abdul Farooq said to be  a
         lawyer dealing with immigration matters.  The Appellants  paid  him
         �12,000 (or thereabouts) for his  services.   Ms  Popol  showed  me
         evidence that Mr Farooq had been convicted  in  2015  for  offences
         linked to his immigration practice.  Those  offences  involved  the
         falsification of immigration documents.  Mr Farooq was assisted, it
         appears, in this enterprise by his partner who worked for the  Home
         Office.  Ms Popol said that the Appellants are adamant that this is
         the gentleman who acted for them previously and who  they  paid  as
         their solicitor.  Ms Popol indicated that the  Appellants  believed
         the Grant Letter to be genuine.  As evidence of that,  she  pointed
         to evidence  that  the  First  Appellant  paid  �100  to  obtain  a
         Biometric Residence Permit as requested by the Grant Letter.


      8. The Respondent does not allege  any  deception  against  the  First
         Appellant or the Appellants generally  in  relation  to  the  Grant
         Letter.  The evidence before me  shows  that,  on  the  balance  of
         probabilities, the Grant Letter is not a  genuine  document.   That
         evidence does not however show that the Appellants were involved in
         the falsification of the Grant Letter.


      9. The fact that the Grant Letter is not genuine, however, puts an end
         to this appeal.  The only ground of appeal relates to whether Judge
         O'Keeffe properly considered the content  and  implication  of  the
         Grant Letter.  Whilst the Judge deals with the  Grant  Letter  only
         briefly at [26] and [27] of the Decision, any error of law in  that
         regard could not possibly be material given that it is now accepted
         that the Grant Letter is not a genuine  letter  sent  by  the  Home
         Office.


     10. For the sake of completeness, I also record  a  further  submission
         made by Ms Popol that certain consequences flow from the duping  of
         the First Appellant  by  Mr  Farooq.   She  pointed  out  that  the
         Appellants  understandably  had  to  change  solicitors  after  the
         Respondent's refusal of leave to  remain  and  before  the  hearing
         before the First-tier Tribunal.  It appeared to be  her  submission
         that, as a result, the Appellants had insufficient time to  prepare
         for the hearing before Judge O'Keeffe and that the refusal  by  the
         First-tier Tribunal to adjourn the hearing was  unfair.   Ms  Popol
         very properly abandoned that submission however having  been  shown
         that the Appellants' current solicitors were instructed as early as
         18 June 2015 (when the refusal letter was apparently faxed to them)
         and that the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal took place over
         one year later  (on  19  August  2016).   The  Appellants'  current
         solicitors asked for the appeals to be determined on the papers, an
         adjournment having been refused on grounds of health of  the  First
         Appellant for failure to produce sufficient medical  evidence  (see
         [8] of the Decision). There is no ground of appeal challenging  the
         Decision on this basis.  Nor is there  any  basis  for  finding  an
         error of law in the Decision for that reason.






    DECISION


    The First-tier Tribunal Decision  did  not  involve  the  making  of  a
    material error on a point of law. I  therefore  uphold  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Decision of Judge O'Keeffe promulgated  on  9  September  2016
    with the consequence that the Appellants' appeal is dismissed.
