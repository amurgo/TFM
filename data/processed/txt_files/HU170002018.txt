                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Nigeria.  His date of birth is  22  April
    1990.  The Appellant appealed against the decision of the Secretary  of
    State to refuse an application on human rights grounds dated  6  August
    2018.  His appeal against that decision was dismissed by Judge  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal ("the FtT") in  a  decision  of  23  December  2019
    following a hearing at Taylor House on 10 October and 22 November 2019.



 2. The Appellant came to the UK as a dependant on 29 July  2007.   He  was
    granted indefinite leave  to  remain  as  a  dependent  relative  on  2
    September 2009.  On 11 April  2018  he  was  sentenced  to  21  months'
    imprisonment as a result of the commission of offences  of  dishonesty.
    Following the Appellant's criminality, the Secretary of State  made  an
    order to deport the Appellant on 20 July 2018.[1]

 3. The Appellant pleaded guilty before Woolwich Crown Court of  one  count
    of converting criminal property.  The judge  sentencing  the  Appellant
    described it as a "relatively sophisticated  operation"  and  described
    the Appellant's criminality as  essentially  an  identity  fraud.   The
    Appellant set up a bank account in the name  of  another  person  which
    enabled him to take control of that person's account. He made transfers
    from the victim's account into his own and other's bank accounts.   The
    benefit of  the  offence  to  the  Appellant  was  �1,800.   The  judge
    described the Appellant as playing a significant role and  the  overall
    loss to the victim was �69,000, that that reflected the sum  that  went
    into the Appellant's account. The purpose behind  the  offence  was  to
    launder money. The sentencing judge had regard to the  Appellant's  age
    and gave him credit for his guilty plea.  He  considered  his  personal
    circumstances, including that he  had  a  3  year-old  daughter  and  a
    stepson.

 4. The matter was listed on 24 March 2020 for an oral hearing in order for
    the Upper Tribunal to determine whether the FtT made an error  of  law,
    permission having been granted to the Appellant by  Judge  of  the  FtT
    Tribunal Osborne on 16 January 2020. In  the  light  of  the  COVID-19
    pandemic that date was vacated and the  President  of  the  UTIAC,  His
    Honourable Judge Lane made directions.

 5. Judge Lane's directions were issued on 8 April 2020.   In  response  to
    those directions the Secretary of State  served  a  Rule  24  response.
    Despite  the  Appellant  having  been  permitted   to   serve   further
    submissions in support of the error of law none have been  received  by
    the Tribunal. An e-mail was sent from those instructed by the Appellant
    to the Tribunal on 21 April 2020  attaching  the  Appellant's  skeleton
    argument. This is dated 16 March 2020 and it is said by the  solicitors
    that it was sent to the court "before on 16 March 2020 along  with  the
    supplementary bundle  referred  to  in  the  skeleton  argument".   The
    document includes a response to the Respondent's Rule 24. Thus the date
    shown on it cannot be accurate.  The Secretary of  State  on  27  April
    2020 e-mailed further submissions in response to the  submissions  made
    by the Appellant.

Rule 34

 6. There are no representations from either party about whether the matter
    should be determined on the papers. Having had full regard to the Pilot
    Practice  Direction:  Contingency  Arrangements  in  the  First   -Tier
    Tribunal and Upper Tribunal, the Presidential Guidance Note No  1  2020
    and all documents submitted by the parties, I conclude that this appeal
    decision should be made without a hearing.  The appeal  can  be  fairly
    and justly determined without the need for a hearing. The parties  have
    been given the opportunity to participate in the proceedings.





The findings of the FtT

 7. The Appellant's appeal was advanced on the basis that the Appellant,  a
    medium offender, met Exception 2 of the of the Nationality, Immigration
    and Asylum Act 2002 on the basis that he has a genuine  and  subsisting
    relationship with his partner and children and that his  removal  would
    be unduly harsh.

 8. The judge heard evidence from the Appellant and his partner [LA].  They
    have a child together, a daughter, "D" who was born on 1 December 2014.
     Ms [A] has an older child, "L" from an earlier relationship.  L's date
    of birth is 30 September 2011.  D's date of birth is 1 December 2014.

 9. The judge heard evidence from the Appellant and his  partner.  She  set
    this out at paragraphs 15  to  24.   The  judge  set  out  the  law  at
    paragraphs 27 to 34.  There  is  no  challenge  to  the  judge's  self-
    direction.

10. The judge made the following findings:-

         "35.     I have had very little evidence of family life enjoyed  by
             the Appellant and his partner.  Although both  say  that  they
             have been in  a  relationship  since  2012,  there  is  little
             evidence of their life  together.   There  are  no  supporting
             statements from either family or friends.  There are  no  bill
             payments in  joint  names.   The  only  information  that  was
             produced at the hearing  was  a  letter  from  [~]  School  in
             Peckham which shows that the Appellant is named as the  father
             of the younger child and the stepfather of the older child and
             that  he  occasionally  brings  the  children  to  school  and
             collects them after school.

         36.  There is a medical report for Miss [A] dated 18 January  2018.
             This points to a strong relationship between the Appellant and
             the  children  and  shows  that  he  supports   the   children
             financially.  I have seen no further reports to show that  the
             Appellant's partner and the children will not  manage  without
             him.

         37.  I bear in mind that the higher courts have all stated that the
             deportation of a parent will be hard and  disruptive  for  the
             children/partners involved.  In KO [2018] UKSC 53 the  Supreme
             Court in paragraph  27  approved  the  finding  of  the  Upper
             Tribunal in MK (Sierra Leone) [2015] where the Upper  Tribunal
             (UT) held:

                  'By way of self-direction,  we  are  mindful  that  unduly
                  harsh does not equate  with  uncomfortable,  inconvenient,
                  undesirable or  merely  difficult.   Rather,  it  poses  a
                  considerably more elevated  threshold.   "Harsh"  in  this
                  context denotes something severe  or  bleak.   It  is  the
                  antithesis of pleasant or comfortable.   Furthermore,  the
                  addition of the adverb "unduly" raises an already elevated
                  standard still higher'.

         38.  The information that I have before me does not show  that  the
             Appellant's removal will have an unduly harsh  impact  on  the
             children.  The children live with their mother.  There  is  no
             information to show that apart  from  the  usual  difficulties
             faced by families who are separated by deportation, the impact
             will  be  unduly  harsh.   It  will  not  be   convenient   or
             comfortable for Miss [A] to be left  with  the  two  children.
             There's nothing to show me that whilst the  Appellant  was  in
             prison she did not manage.  There is nothing to show the  more
             elevated threshold described in MK  where  the  UT  said  that
             harsh denoted something be severe or bleak and  unduly  raised
             this to something even higher.

         39.  The Appellant is returning to  Nigeria.   The  evidence  shows
             that his father was removed to Nigeria  at  some  point.   The
             Respondent's bundle contains the immigration  history  of  the
             Appellant.  It is noted that on 2 September 2009 the Appellant
             was granted indefinite leave to remain as a dependent relative
             of a  settled  person  (his  father).   His  father's  British
             citizenship was subsequently nullified  in  2012,  as  he  was
             found to have obtained this using false details.   It  appears
             that the Appellant's father left in July 2015.   Certainly,  I
             heard no evidence from the Appellant's father, his stepmother,
             or any siblings.

         40.  The Appellant in his statement at paragraph 2 states  that  he
             had lived in the United Kingdom between 2001 and 2007 and then
             he was taken back  to  Nigeria  by  his  parent  in  order  to
             regularise his stay in  the  United  Kingdom.   Any  stay  the
             Appellant that  the  Appellant  (sic)  had  in  2001-2007  was
             without  authority.   The  Appellant's  father's   immigration
             history throws into question the legality of  the  Appellant's
             own status.

         41.  As the Appellant has his father in Nigeria and  he  was  there
             himself until 2007, he will be able to reintegrate  into  life
             there.  Whilst I accept that it will be unduly harsh to expect
             the two children and Miss [A] to accompany him to  Nigeria,  I
             do not find that it would be unduly harsh for the children  to
             remain in the United Kingdom with Miss [A].  As  I have  said
             above there is no evidence to show that she was unable to cope
             whilst the Appellant was in prison".

The Grounds of Appeal

11. The grounds seeking permission are narrow.  It  is  asserted  that  the
    judge failed to make a  finding  in  respect  of  the  children's  best
    interests pursuant  to  Section  55  of  the  Border,  Citizenship  and
    Immigration Act 2009 ("the 2009 Act") and did not take into account the
    Appellant's family life.

12. The grant of permission concludes that it is arguable  that  the  judge
    failed to assess and make a finding as to what is in the  child's  best
    interests and it is arguable that such a finding should have been  made
    before the issue of unduly harsh  was  considered.   All  grounds  were
    found to be arguable.

13. The Appellant chose not to submit further submissions  in  response  to
    Judge Lane's directions.  The Secretary of  State's  Rule  24  response
    maintains that there is no error of law.  It is asserted that the judge
    had regard to the available evidence. It is observed that  the  grounds
    seeking permission do not set out or  seek  to  argue  that  the  judge
    failed to consider material evidence.  It is argued that the judge  had
    the correct test in mind when considering "unduly  harsh"  and  applied
    the guidance in KO (Nigeria) v the Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2018] UKSC 53.  It is argued that the judge referred to the
    principle of best interests, at paragraph 7, in respect of the decision
    of the Secretary of State.   The  judge  had  regard  to  all  relevant
    factors relating to the children's best interests.

Conclusions

14. In the Appellant skeleton argument before me, it is  asserted  the  FtT
    failed to consider the Appellant's supplementary bundle which contained
    further evidence of his family life  with  his  children  and  partner.
    This is a matter not raised in the grounds  of  appeal.  The  Appellant
    seeks to rely on a ground of appeal which he does not  have  permission
    to argue. There is no application to amend the grounds.

15. The directions did  not  permit  the  Secretary  of  State  to  further
    respond; however, in the light of the additional ground of  appeal  now
    raised by the Appellant, I consider, the Secretary of State's  response
    to this.  The Secretary of State contends that the allegation is wholly
    without merit and that the appeal hearing was part heard to enable  the
    Appellant to produce  further  evidence.  The  judge  referred  to  the
    medical  report  relating  to   the   Appellant's   partner   (in   the
    supplementary bundle) at paragraphs 14, 23, 24 and 36 of the  decision.
    Furthermore, the judge asked clarification questions (see paragraph  23
    of the decision) in relation to the contents of the document.

16. The best interests of children  is  a  primary  factor  when  assessing
    proportionality generally, but it is not paramount (see ZH (Tanzania) v
    SSHD [2011] UKSC 4).  It is incumbent  on  a  judge  to  determine  the
    relative strength of the factors which make it in their best interests.
     In the context of removal, if it is overwhelmingly in the child's best
    interests to remain, the need to  maintain  immigration  control  could
    well not tip the balance. This is  an  appeal  concerning  deportation.
    The best  interests  of  children  certainly  carry  great  weight,  as
    identified by Lord Kerr in  HH  v  Deputy  Prosecutor  of  the  Italian
    Republic [2012] UKSC 25 AT [145];  however,  it  is  a  consequence  of
    criminal conduct that offenders may be separated  from  their  children
    for many years, contrary to the best interests of those  children.  The
    desirability of children being with both parents is  a  commonplace  of
    family life. That is not usually a sufficiently compelling circumstance
    to outweigh the high public interest in deporting foreign criminals. As
    Rafferty LJ observed in SSHD v CT (Vietnam) [2016 EWCA Civ 488 at [38]:



         "Neither the British nationality of the respondent's  children  nor
         their likely separation from their  father  for  a  long  time  are
         exceptional circumstances which outweigh the public interest in his
         deportation."

17. There is no merit in the suggestion that the judge did not consider the
    evidence before her when assessing propotionality.  Had  the  Appellant
    permission to argue this as a ground of appeal, which he does  not,  it
    has no substance.  It is evident from the decision of  the  judge  that
    for the reasons identified by the Respondent that she had before her  a
    supplementary bundle.  She specifically engaged with  the  letter  from
    Sarah Ryan, Adult Mental  Health  Practitioner  in  Southwark  Parental
    Health Team, dated 18  January  2018  at  [36]  of  the  decision.  The
    Appellant's solicitors fail to identify any evidence within that bundle
    that the judge does not specifically  refer  to  that  would  make  any
    difference to the outcome.

18. The  Appellant's  grounds  of  appeal  do  not  make  any  discrete  or
    sustainable challenge the  assessment  of  whether  separation  of  the
    family would be unduly harsh.  There is no properly identified material
    evidence that the judge did not consider.  The  Respondent's  case  was
    that the relationship between the Appellant and  his  partner  and  the
    children  was  not  genuine  and  subsisting.   There  was  before  the
    Respondent an absence of evidence  supporting  the  relationships.  The
    judge however, disagreed with the Respondent to an extent. She said  at
    [35] that there was very little evidence  before  her  of  family  life
    between the Appellant and his partner. She then said at [36]  that  the
    letter from Sarah Ryan pointed to a  strong  relationship  between  the
    Appellant and the children, however that there was no evidence to  show
    that their  mother  and  the  children  will  not  manage  without  the
    Appellant. A proper reading of the decision discloses  that  the  judge
    accepted that there was a genuine and subsisting  relationship  between
    the Appellant and his children and that there  was  a  relationship  of
    sorts between the Appellant and his partner.

19. The judge went onto  consider  unduly  harsh  in  the  context  of  the
    Appellant staying here with their mother. She accepted that it would be
    unduly harsh for partner and the children to relocate to Nigeria.  When
    assessing unduly harsh she did not identify the best interests  of  the
    children. However, she set out at [7] that the Respondent had  properly
    concluded that the best interests of the children is a primary  factor.
    She understood the relevance of s55 of the  2009  Act.   There  was  no
    countervailing evidence which would justify an unusual finding that  it
    would not be in the children's best interests to be with  their  father
    and mother here in the United Kingdom particularly in the light of  the
    judge having accepted the relationships.  She understood  the  law  and
    proceeded to assess unduly harsh  on  the  basis  that  it  is  in  the
    children's best interests to remain here in the United Kingdom with the
    Appellant.  While she could have made this clearer, this was  the  only
    rational conclusion to have reached on the evidence and considering the
    findings she made. Had she not proceeded on the basis  that  it  is  in
    their best interests to remain in the United Kingdom with their father,
    it is difficult to see why she would have gone onto to consider  unduly
    harsh.

20. Before the judge there was no evidence that separation  would  lead  to
    degree of harshness going beyond what would necessarily be involved for
    any child faced with the deportation of a parent. As we  know  from  KO
    (Nigeria) v the Secretary of State for the Home Department [2018]  UKSC
    53, it is an elevated threshold denoting something severe or  bleak  to
    be evaluated exclusively from the effect on the child.  This  has  been
    further explained by the Court of Appeal in SSHD v PG (Jamaica)  [2019]
    EWCA Civ 1213, where it was said that the 'commonplace' distress caused
    be separation from a parent or partner insufficient to meet  the  test.
    There was no evidence before the judge capable of reaching the elevated
    test. The grounds of appeal before me do not seek to identify any  such
    evidence. There is no application under Rule 15 (2A) to adduce  further
    evidence that was not before the FtT.

21. I accept that had the judge proceeded  to  consider  unduly  harsh  and
    proportionality without having in mind the children's  best  interests,
    it could undermine the overall assessment. However, in this case, I  do
    not understand from reading her decision that this  is  what  she  did.
    There is no challenge to the overall unduly harsh assessment. The judge
    did not fail to  consider  material  evidence.  She  properly  directed
    herself in respect of KO (Nigeria) v the Secretary  of  State  for  the
    Home Department [2018] UKSC 53 and applied the correct test.   Moreover
    on the basis that it is in the children's best interests  for  them  to
    remain here with both parents, on the scant evidence before  the  judge
    relating  to  the  quality  of  the  relationship  and  the  impact  of
    separation, properly applying the law, there  is  only  one  conclusion
    that the judge could reach in respect of Article 8.  The  evidence  was
    insufficient to establish that separation would be unduly harsh.

22. The FtT did not make a material error of law. The decision  to  dismiss
    the Appellant's appeal under Article 8 is maintained.

No anonymity direction is made.
