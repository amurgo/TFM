                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

For the Appellant:     No attendance
For the Respondent:    Mr Bramble

                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appellant

 1. The application for permission to appeal was made by the  Secretary  of
    State.  Nonetheless I  have  referred  to  the  parties  as  they  were
    described before the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. At the hearing before me the appellant did not attend.  A  letter  from
    SEB Solicitors dated 25th August 2017 informed the  Tribunal  that  the
    appellant was "unable to afford the Counsel's fee and  also  unable  to
    attend personally because of  his  physical  fitness".   There  was  no
    indication of any medical documentation and despite the absence of  the
    appellant because the solicitors representing him  indicated  that  the
    Tribunal should make the decision on the basis of  the  paper  provided
    within the respondent's bundle I proceeded with the hearing.

 3. The appellant had made a combined application for leave  to  remain  in
    the UK as a Tier 4 (General) Student.   That  application  was  refused
    under paragraph 322(2) of the Immigration Rules on  the  basis  that  a
    false  document  had  been  submitted  in  relation  to  the   previous
    application namely a TOEIC certificate in  support  of  an  application
    made on 15th September 2012 for leave to remain as a Tier  4  (General)
    Student.  The Secretary of State asserted that ETS had advised  that  a
    TOEIC test submitted by  the  applicant  was  "invalid"  owing  to  the
    presence of a proxy tester who sat the test.

    Grounds on which leave to remain and variation of  leave  to  enter  or
    remain in the United Kingdom should normally be refused

    322(2)       the making of false  representations  or  the  failure  to
           disclose any material fact for the purpose of obtaining leave to
           enter or a previous variation of leave or  in  order  to  obtain
           documents from the Secretary of State or a third party  required
           in support of the application for leave to enter or  a  previous
           variation of leave.

 4. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  McIntosh  allowed  the  appellant's  appeal
    against the refusal on the basis that

         "I cannot however state that on the balance of  probabilities  that
         the respondent has discharged the burden upon her as  there  is  no
         direct evidence from Mr Millington or Ms Collings relating to  this
         specific case.  Their evidence is largely hearsay and not  verified
         by any witness that understood the test (paragraph 30).

 5. At paragraph 32 the judge stated

         "I have not been given the benefit  of  seeing  any  document  that
         confirms the  identity  of  the  person  that  conducted  the  test
         relating to the appellant's IELTS result.  There is no  documentary
         evidence that shows that the voice recognition test in relation  to
         this appellant ever took place.  The  evidence  is  unspecific  and
         general and therefore I have to conclude that  it  is  inconclusive
         (paragraph 32).

 6. In the circumstances the judge found that the Secretary  of  State  had
    not discharged the burden to show that the appellant had used deception
    to obtain "his IELTS".

 7. An application for permission to appeal was made on  the  grounds  that
    (i) the judge made no reference to the evidence and (ii)  had  confused
    the evidence.

 8. Ground (i)  - the First-tier Tribunal Judge made no  reference  to  the
    ETS spreadsheet extract which  was  evidenced  at  E1  and  E2  of  the
    respondent's bundle and read together with the two statements  and  the
    spreadsheet containing the specific  confirmation  of  the  appellant's
    identification provided both a clear explanation of the careful  method
    used to detect fraud and documentary evidence that the appellant's test
    results had been identified as invalid by use of this method.

 9. This ground is quite clearly made out.  The judge failed to  apply  the
    guidance of SM Qadir [2016] UKUT (229) IAC, a judgment which held  that
    the Secretary of State had discharged the initial evidential burden  of
    proof [67]-[68] and it was for an appellant to show  credible  evidence
    that they had passed the ETS  test  and  that  there  was  an  innocent
    explanation to counter  the  evidence.   That  decision  is  in  effect
    confirmed by Shehzad [2016] EWCA Civ 615 at [21].  Further analysis  is
    fact specific.  The judge failed to address  the  documentary  evidence
    which was clearly included in the respondent's bundle.

10. Ground (ii) - The Secretary of State advanced that it was not clear why
    the judge referred throughout the decision to an IELTS test [30, 32 and
    33].  The certificate in  question  was  a  TOEIC  one.   The  Tribunal
    appears simply to have made an  assessment  of  whether  the  appellant
    genuinely took an IELTS test that there  is  as  a  result  nothing  to
    counter the allegation of deception in the TOEIC test and  further  the
    Tribunal failed to take into account the report of Professor French  or
    the Operation Faï¿½ade Report of results of all the tests  taken  at  the
    Elizabeth College on the same day the appellant took his  test.   There
    was no analysis of those documents provided by the respondent.

11. It is quite clear that this ground is also made out.  At  paragraph  32
    as set out above the judge refers to the fact that he had not seen  any
    document that confirmed the identity of the person that  conducted  the
    test relating  to  the  appellant's  IELTS  result.   The  document  in
    question was not an IELTS test but a TOEIC test.

12. There is no indication  that  the  judge  made  any  reference  to  the
    documents in the respondent's bundle namely  D1  and  E1.   E1  clearly
    confirms that the certificate is classified as invalid.   The  document
    D1 identified that the applicant "used an invalid TOEIC certificate  in
    previous Tier 4 applications.  Invalid certificate  used  for  speaking
    score.  A copy of an invalid certificate in HO File".

13. The judge is clearly confused in his application the law to the  matter
    of deception in this case.  As he allowed the matter on  the  basis  of
    the Immigration Rules he failed to proceed to consider  the  matter  in
    relation to Article 8, which I note, was also a ground of appeal.

14. The Judge erred materially for the reasons identified. I set aside  the
    decision pursuant to Section 12(2) (a)  of  the  Tribunals  Courts  and
    Enforcement Act 2007 (TCE 2007).  Bearing in mind the nature and extent
    of the findings to be made in relation to the evidence presented by the
    Secretary of State regarding deception and the further findings  to  be
    made in respect of Article 8 this matter is to be remitted to the First-
    tier Tribunal under section 12(2) (b) (i) of the TCE 2007  and  further
    to 7.2 (b) of the Presidential Practice Statement.

15. I set aside the decision of Judge McIntosh and remit the matter to  the
    First-tier Tribunal.

No anonymity direction is made.
