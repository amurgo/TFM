Representation:
For the Appellant:      Mr A Alam, of Counsel, instructed by A2 Solicitors
For the Respondent:     Mr L Tarlow, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


      1. The appellant, born  on  [  ]  1980,  successfully  challenged  the
         determination of First-tier Tribunal Judge Fox who  on  19  January
         2017 dismissed his appeal against the  respondent's  refusal  of  9
         November 2016 to grant him protection in the UK as an  undocumented
         Kuwaiti Bidoon. Judge Fox's decision  was  set  aside  following  a
         hearing before me at Field House on 24 August  2017.  Full  reasons
         are set out in my determination of 25 August 2017. Essentially, the
         judge based his assessment on inaccurate facts and failed  to  make
         findings on core issues.


         The Hearing

      2. The appellant attended the hearing  with  two  witnesses.  I  heard
         evidence  from  all  three  individuals  in   Arabic   through   an
         interpreter they all confirmed they understood.


      3. The appellant gave evidence first. He confirmed he  resided  at  an
         address in Stanmore and he adopted the contents of  two  statements
         dated 14 December 2016 and 24 October 2017.


      4. The appellant was asked about his answers at  interview  about  the
         nationality registration process. He stated  that  the  authorities
         had come to the towns to  register  people  (for  the  census).  He
         stated that in 1996 his father had approached the panel for  people
         without identity but had been told that because  he  had  not  been
         registered in the 1965  census,  he  could  not  now  rectify  that
         situation.


      5. The appellant was taken  to  the  family  tree  in  the  bundle  of
         documents. He said that F  was  his  mother,  S  was  his  maternal
         grandfather and Rk was the son of Rh. His witness, AS, was the  son
         of Rk. That completed examination in chief.



      6. In response to questions asked in cross-examination, the  appellant
         sad that he had sold goats to earn a living. He was not  the  owner
         of the animals but acted as a middle man. He had  been  doing  this
         work since the age of 22-23. Prior to that he had done nothing.  He
         used to live in Salaibiya. He had never been to  school.  He  never
         had an identity card and never had access to medical treatment. His
         father also sold goats.



      7. The appellant was asked about the 1965 census.  He  said  that  the
         officials had come to the towns to take details of people  for  the
         census but his father and other relatives had been  living  in  the
         desert and the officials did not go there. He stated that  none  of
         his relatives had been registered.



      8. The appellant confirmed that he had  attended  a  demonstration  in
         support of Bidoons on 2 October 2012. That was the only one he  had
         attended. He had been told by a  friend  about  it.  He  said  "all
         Bidoons" participated. The demonstration was held in a place called
         Taema and people had demanded their rights. He  had  been  carrying
         the Kuwaiti flag. It had been a peaceful demonstration but then the
         police attacked the demonstrators. Following the demonstration,  he
         had been arrested from home. He was taken  to  the  state  security
         office in the south of Asura (referred to elsewhere as Surra but  I
         place no weight on that variation). He was not charged.



      9. The appellant was asked how he had been found at home if there  was
         no record of him. He said that his friend, EA, had been arrested at
         the demonstration and had given them his details. He had been  with
         his friend but when the police intervened, he had rum away. He said
         the police had been in plain  clothes  and  had  mingled  with  the
         crowd. They had told him this when he was arrested.



     10.  The  appellant  stated  that  there  had  been  a  lot  of   press
         photographers at the demonstration.



     11. The appellant said he  had  been  tortured  during  his  period  of
         detention. His arms had been pulled up, his legs were tied  and  he
         was flogged on his back, his feet, his face and  the  back  of  his
         head. He had sustained injuries but had not been given any  medical
         treatment. They brought him some papers to sign  and  he  was  then
         taken to Salaibiya police station and  released.  He  thought  that
         Asura was some 35-40 minutes' drive from Salaibiya. He did not know
         the contents of the papers as he could not read or write but he was
         forced to sign them. He was told that  he  had  been  charged  with
         criminal damage of state property and insulting the Prince. When he
         protested his innocence, they agreed  that  he  had  not  committed
         these offences but they told him they wanted him to be a spy and to
         provide them with information about other Bidoons who attended  the
         demonstration. He agreed to co-operate  because  he  wanted  to  be
         released although he then said that he did not know the  people  at
         the  demonstration  of  whom  there  had  been  some  350-400.  The
         appellant then went home but later that day he went to  stay  in  a
         pasture for goats in Chebet. He stayed there 2-2 ï¿½ years. There was
         a room there. He then went to  Baghdad  with  a  smuggler  who  had
         prepared papers for him to apply  for  a  US  visa.  This  was  not
         granted; he did not know why.  That  completed  cross  examination.
         There was no re-examination.


     12. After a lunch break, I then put some questions to the appellant for
         clarification.  I  asked  how  he  was  able  to  sign  if  he  was
         illiterate. He said he made "scratches with the pen". He was  asked
         why he had not made  any  mention  in  his  oral  evidence  of  his
         father's second attempt in 1998 to register with  the  authorities.
         He said he had only been asked  about  1996.  It  was  put  to  the
         appellant that he had just been asked when his father had tried  to
         register and that it was his evidence that it had been in 1996. The
         appellant said he had not understood  the  question.  I  asked  the
         appellant whether he had had any problems prior to his  arrest.  He
         asked "what problems?". I asked  whether  he  had  experienced  any
         previous problems with the authorities. He said he had not. I asked
         whether he had ever previously been to the field where he had taken
         refuge. He replied in the negative. I asked why then  he  had  gone
         there. He stated that the land belonged to his father's friend  who
         had said it was safe and far away. The friend had taken him  there.
         It was about 30-35 minutes' drive away. I asked whether he had  had
         any contact with anyone whilst hiding in the field.  The  appellant
         said he had not. I asked how he had contacted the smuggler. He said
         his father's friend had arranged everything. I  asked  how  he  had
         found out about the arrangements. He replied that  the  friend  had
         told him about it ten days earlier. He  used  to  visit  the  field
         regularly to trade in goats and they used to see each  other  every
         time. He said he had no contact with anyone  except  this  man.  He
         brought him food every seven days. He was not a Bidoon.  He  was  a
         Kuwaiti.


     13. I asked what had happened to EA following his arrest. The appellant
         said he had heard from his father's friend that he had either  been
         sentenced to death of to life imprisonment. He had found  out  from
         the appellant's family because they lived in the same neighbourhood
         as EA's family.



     14. I asked when the appellant had been arrested.  He  replied  it  had
         been on 21 October. The demonstration had  been  on  2  October.  I
         asked how he was able to recall dates if he was illiterate. He said
         his family told him "on this date you disappeared". He then changed
         this to his father's friend had told him the dates  of  his  arrest
         and of the demonstration. The friend was called AM.



     15. The appellant said that he had hidden at home between the  date  of
         the demonstration and the date of his arrest because he was  scared
         but he knew from his father that EA had been arrested. EA  had  not
         been released. That was why he knew EA had been sentenced  to  life
         in prison or to death.



     16. I asked whether there were any reports of the demonstration in  the
         press. The appellant said he did not care about newspapers  and  he
         was illiterate.



     17. I asked what rights had been demanded  at  the  demonstration.  The
         appellant stated that Bidoons did not have nationality of ID.  They
         were badly treated. They did not go to school and had no passports.
         I  asked  in  what  way  he  had  been  badly  treated  before  the
         demonstration. He replied he could not get health care and did  not
         have a house. He said: "We just eat". He said Bidoons could not buy
         houses.  There were other Bidoons in his neighbourhood.  It  was  a
         primarily Bidoon area and he had  family,  cousins  and  neighbours
         whom he knew. Some of the people  in  the  area  had  gone  to  the
         demonstration which had been 10-15 minutes by car from  his  house.
         He and  many  others  had  gathered  together  and  then  they  all
         travelled together to Taema for the  demonstration.  EA  went  with
         him.



     18. The appellant said he had one older brother, two  younger  brothers
         and two younger sisters. None of them attended  the  demonstration.
         Two of his brothers worked; they  washed  cars.  His  sisters  were
         unmarried.



     19. The appellant said that the journey to Baghdad had taken 8-9  hours
         by car. He had stayed there 46 days. When I commented that he had a
         good memory for dates and times,  he  said  he  was  young  and  he
         understood.



     20. The appellant said he had never been to Asura before.  He  did  not
         know the state security office was there until AM  told  him  about
         his release. AM owned goats which he traded. I  asked  whether  the
         appellant worked for him. He said that both he had his father  did.
         Neither party had any questions  arising  and  that  completed  the
         appellant's oral evidence.



     21. I then heard evidence from AS. He gave the same residential address
         as the appellant. he confirmed the  contents  of  his  two  witness
         statements.  He  named  his  parents.  He  produced   evidence   of
         identification in the form of his driving licence.  He  was  now  a
         British national. he was then tendered for cross-examination.



     22. AS confirmed he entered the UK on  6  February  2007  by  air  from
         Kuwait. He used a forged passport provided by an agent  to  travel.
         After his arrival, the agent took it from him. He confirmed he went
         through  immigration  control  using  the  passport.  He  said   he
         successfully claimed  asylum.  That  completed  cross  examination.
         There was no re-examination.



     23. In reply to my questions, the witness said  that  he  had  attended
         secondary school in Kuwait. He had been six and attended for  eight
         years. He worked  selling  goats.  He  made  his  asylum  claim  on
         arrival. The agent took his passport away on the flight.



     24. I asked how he had met up with the appellant in the UK.  He  stated
         that the appellant had called him in November 2016. He then went to
         Newcastle and brought the appellant back with him.  They  had  been
         living together ever since. He was related to the appellant through
         his mother's side. Both he and the appellant  lived  in  Salaibiya,
         about 10 minutes' walk  apart.  He  knew  the  appellant's  family;
         parents, three brothers and two sisters. The appellant had told him
         about the demonstration. He had told him that he had attended  with
         a friend. That was all. I asked whether he knew why  the  appellant
         had come here. The witness replied that it was  because  he  was  a
         Bidoon and was wanted by the authorities for  having  attended  the
         demonstration. I asked whether the appellant had told him about any
         problems he had had with the authorities. the witness replied  that
         all Bidoons had problems. They could not work, receive health  care
         or education. Neither party had any questions arising.



     25. The third witness, AA, then gave  evidence.  He  lived  on  Edgware
         Road. He confirmed the contents of his statement. He said that they
         had discussed their difficult lives in Kuwait; lives with no access
         to health care, work or education.



     26. In cross examination, AA said he had travelled here through Austria
         and France. He  used  to  live  in  Salaibiya  and  had  known  the
         appellant there. They lived 5-6 minutes' walk  away.  He  knew  the
         appellant's family and had been to his  house.  The  appellant  was
         married and lived with his wife, parents and siblings. AA was about
         34 years old when he left Kuwait. He had not been to school. He had
         no documents. That completed cross examination. There  was  no  re-
         examination.



     27. In response to my questions, the witness  said  the  appellant  had
         three brothers and two sisters. His wife still lived in Kuwait.  He
         had met up with the appellant last year when he saw him  by  chance
         on Edgware Road. The appellant had  told  him  he  had  been  on  a
         demonstration and had been arrested  and  imprisoned.  The  witness
         sold vegetables in Kuwait. He said if Bidoons required  medication,
         they went to a pharmacy or tried natural herbs.  He  last  saw  the
         appellant in Kuwait in 2012. When he visited his family after that,
         they were afraid and said he was not around. The  witness  said  he
         had been working at the time of the demonstration and was afraid to
         go. He did not know anyone who went. He had  not  known  the  other
         witness in Kuwait. Neither party had any questions arising and that
         completed the oral evidence.



     28. I then heard submissions from the parties. Mr Tarlow relied on  the
         refusal  letter.  He  submitted  that  the  appellant   had   given
         contradictory evidence about the US visa application. His  evidence
         about the demonstration lacked detail. It was not possible that the
         authorities would have found him at home if he was unregistered. It
         was not credible that he had lived in a field for two years without
         seeing anyone. He left using a forged passport. He would  not  have
         been able to do so had he been wanted.



     29. Mr Alam submitted that following country guidance, if it were found
         that the appellant was an undocumented Bidoon then he was  entitled
         to asylum. The burden was low and the respondent had  raised  minor
         points. He  was  consistent  about  his  lack  of  education.  Both
         witnesses knew him in Kuwait.  It  was  possible  to  obtain  false
         documents in Iraq. There was nothing which required the  appeal  to
         be dismissed. He should be given the  benefit  of  the  doubt.  The
         document from the Bidoon Committee confirmed his claim.



     30. At the conclusion of the hearing I reserved my determination  which
         I now give.









         Findings and Conclusions




     31. Before making any findings, I have regard to the lower standard  of
         proof on the appellant to make  out  his  case  and  I  have  given
         careful consideration to all the appellant's  evidence  before  me,
         the evidence of his witnesses and  the  submissions  made.  I  have
         tried my utmost to give careful consideration to  all  the  country
         material submitted for the appellant but it has to be said that the
         quality of the photocopying of various reports  and  news  articles
         leaves much to be desired and  that  the  highlighting  of  certain
         sections   make   already   faint    print    largely    illegible.
         Representatives  should  take  case  when  preparing   bundles   of
         documentary evidence. These are not of acceptable quality.


     32. The appeal proceeds on asylum/article 3 grounds only, there  having
         been no challenge to the findings of the First-tier Tribunal  Judge
         on article 8.



     33. I have regard to BA (Bidoon - statelessness - risk of  persecution)
         Kuwait CG [2004] UKIAT 00256, HE (Bidoon,  Statelessness,  Risk  of
         persecution) [2006] UKAIT  00051  and  NM  (documented/undocumented
         Bidoon: risk) Kuwait CG [2013] 356.


     34. The claim can be divided into two limbs;  the  first  is  that  the
         appellant is an undocumented Bidoon and the second is that  he  was
         imprisoned by the authorities, released upon his agreement  to  act
         as a spy and is actively wanted because he fled his home in  breach
         of his agreement to co-operate.


     35. I find there are significant issues regarding  the  credibility  of
         the second limb of the claim and as a result I do not  accept  that
         the appellant was arrested, detained, tortured, that he had to hide
         for 2 - 2 ï¿½ years or that he had to flee Kuwait  for  that  reason.
         Nor do I accept that the authorities have been actively seeking him
         out, raiding the family home and ill-treating his family. I set out
         my reasons for these conclusions below in no order of priority.



     36.  For  someone  who  claims  to  be  illiterate,  the  appellant  is
         remarkably  adept  at  recalling  and  reciting  dates,  distances,
         periods of time and has  been  consistent  in  the  manner  of  his
         signature which he described as "scratches of a pen". My experience
         of illiterate appellants is that  dates,  numbers  and  time  means
         nothing to them; certainly not dates and times from  several  years
         ago.  His  ability  to  recall  these  details  without  hesitation
         suggests to me that he has learnt a story to  recite.  Further,  it
         does not support an account of no  education.  In  any  event,  his
         claim that Bidoons  cannot  attend  school  is  undermined  by  the
         evidence of his own witness whose evidence was that he,  a  Bidoon,
         had attended secondary school for eight years.



     37. The appellant's account of  the  demonstration  he  attended  on  2
         October 2012 is unsatisfactory. His answers at interview suggest he
         went along only because a friend persuaded him to go. In his  first
         witness statement, he paints  a  completely  different  picture  of
         someone outraged by the lack of rights held by Bidoons and  willing
         to risk his own safety in making his protest known.



     38. Although  the  appellant  stated  in  oral  evidence  that  he  was
         identified by the authorities because his  details  were  given  to
         them by EA, his arrested friend, he stated in his witness statement
         that he did not know  how  he  was  identified  and  speculated  on
         possibilities.



     39. When his witness, AS, was asked about what problems  the  appellant
         had experienced in Kuwait that had led to his departure, he made no
         reference at all to the appellant's imprisonment  and  torture  and
         referred only to general difficulties faced by Bidoons of a lack of
         access to employment, education and health  care.  Given  that  the
         appellant and his witness say they are related and that  they  have
         been living together for a year, I do not accept that  the  witness
         would be ignorant of such significant matters if  they  had  indeed
         occurred.



     40. The appellant stated in evidence that he did not know  any  of  the
         people who had attended the demonstration.  He  later  contradicted
         himself when he claimed he had gather together with many others and
         they had all gone together to Taema. He was also inconsistent  when
         he claimed that all Bidoons had attended the event but  later  said
         that only a few people from his area had gone. Given  his  apparent
         ignorance  of  other  attendees,  it  is  not  credible  that   the
         authorities would consider him a useful source of information.



     41. Despite the appellant's claim that there was a high press  presence
         at the demonstration, I was not referred to any  news  articles  to
         confirm the event. I am able, only just, to make out references  to
         demonstrations in 2011, January, May,  July,  15  and  20  October,
         November and December 2012 in the Amnesty International  and  Human
         Rights Watch reports, but can see no reference to  a  demonstration
         on 2 October 2012.



     42. The appellant gave inconsistent evidence of the fate of his friend,
         EA. At the hearing, he said that he had been told by AM that EA had
         either been sentenced to life imprisonment or to  death.  This  was
         based on an assumption because he had not been  released.   In  his
         witness statement, the appellant stated that he had heard  that  EA
         had been executed.



     43. At the hearing, the appellant described the  ill-treatment  he  had
         suffered in detention. He made no reference to being  subjected  to
         electric shocks on  his  body  and  genitalia  (as  was  stated  at
         interview). I cannot accept  that  he  would  have  forgotten  such
         horrific treatment had it occurred.



     44. The appellant claimed he had sustained injuries  following  several
         months in prison being subjected to sustained torture and  inhumane
         conditions yet on the very day of his release he was well enough to
         go off and hide in a field for over two years without  seeking  any
         treatment from a pharmacist or a herbalist/natural healer. He  does
         not describe any scars on his body or any ongoing conditions  as  a
         result of that torture.



     45. The appellant gave inconsistent evidence as to whether  or  not  he
         was charged with any offence. Initially in oral evidence he said he
         had not been charged but later he said he was.



     46. The appellant initially stated that he had no contact  with  anyone
         whilst in hiding. When further questions were put  about  he  could
         have made arrangements with the agent or obtained food  and  water,
         he changed his account and said he  had  seen  AM  every  week.  At
         interview, he also claimed there was an Indian man working there.



     47. Different descriptions  are  given  of  the  appellant's  place  of
         hiding. At the hearing, he described it as a field where goats were
         put out to pasture. At interview, he maintained he hid  in  stables
         on a farm.



     48. The appellant blatantly lied about his journey to Baghdad to  apply
         twice for a  US  visa.  Eventually,  when  faced  with  irrefutable
         evidence, he admitted he had made an application. It undermines his
         credibility that he lied about this in the first place.



     49. For these reasons, I do not accept that the appellant's account  of
         his experiences in Kuwait is truthful in so far as  it  relates  to
         his attendance at a demonstration and his subsequent  imprisonment.
         There had been ample opportunity for Mr Alam  to  seek  to  resolve
         these issues in re-examination but he did  not  make  use  of  that
         opportunity.



     50. That is not, however, the end of the matter. I must make a  finding
         on whether the appellant is an  undocumented  Bidoon  from  Kuwait.
         That is a claim which I must  assess  notwithstanding  the  adverse
         credibility findings on other aspects of the evidence.



     51. I am assisted in that by the persuasive evidence of the appellant's
         first witness and, to a lesser extent, the second.  Both  witnesses
         knew the appellant personally in Kuwait and indeed  were  from  the
         same neighbourhood and knew his family. I have no reason  to  doubt
         that and their evidence was not challenged  by  Mr  Tarlow  in  his
         submissions. Both gave spontaneous evidence about  the  appellant's
         family members, a matter which they were not questioned on  at  the
         previous hearing and, therefore, a matter  on  which  they  had  no
         reason to believe they would be asked questions.



     52. Both witnesses have been accepted as undocumented  Bidoons  by  the
         respondent; the first (now a British citizen), without any need for
         an appeal and the second after a successful appeal  hearing  and  a
         failed challenge by the respondent to the Upper Tribunal. The first
         witness is related to the appellant and having seen the family tree
         and having heard the evidence to explain it, I am satisfied that is
         the case. Their evidence and their  own  positions,  ethnicity  and
         backgrounds is strong evidence  in  the  appellant's  favour.  Both
         witnesses gave straightforward evidence. Cross examination did  not
         undo their evidence in any way and they were able to satisfactorily
         answer the questions that I put to them.



     53. Mr Tarlow did not seek to argue that the  appellant  was  not  from
         Kuwait and was instead an Iraqi national as is sometimes argued  by
         the respondent in these cases. I  have  seen  documentary  evidence
         that forged Iraqi passports are easily obtainable and so  the  fact
         that the appellant used one to travel to Europe  does  not  detract
         from his claim to be from Kuwait.



     54. The appellant's evidence about the 1965 census was consistent and I
         accept it was plausible that the  officials  did  not  bother  with
         those living outside the towns in the desert areas.  I accept  that
         an unsuccessful attempt was made, at least in 1996 if not 1998,  by
         the appellant's father, with or without the appellant, to  register
         the family.  I  accept  that  as  there  was  no  record  of  prior
         registration, this was not achieved.



     55. I am  not  impressed  by  the  letter  from  the  'Kuwaiti  Bedoons
         Movement'. It gives no details of how the author satisfied  himself
         that the appellant was an undocumented Bidoon or what expertise  he
         has to profess such an opinion.



     56. Bearing in mind,  however,  the  low  standard  of  proof  and  the
         positive  evidence  from  the  two  witnesses,  both  accepted   as
         undocumented Bidoons themselves, and their unchallenged evidence as
         to their knowledge of the appellant in Salaibiya,  I  am  satisfied
         that the appellant has  established  that  he  is  an  undocumented
         Bidoon.



     57.  Applying  the  country  guidance  set  out  in  the  above  cases,
         specifically head note  (3)  of  NM  which  states:  "the  evidence
         concerning undocumented Bidoon does show them to face a  real  risk
         of persecution or breach  of  their  protected  human  rights",  it
         follows that the appellant is entitled to  refugee  status.  As  an
         undocumented Bidoon, he would be at a real risk of serious harm  on
         return to Kuwait.  Article 3 is also engaged.



     58. There was no challenge to the article 8 decision made by Judge  Fox
         and that stands.



     59. Decision


     60. The appeal is allowed on asylum and article 3 grounds.



     61. Anonymity



     62. I continue the anonymity order made by the First-tier Tribunal.
