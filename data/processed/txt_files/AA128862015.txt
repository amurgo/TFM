Representation:
For the Appellant:     Miss Pickering, Counsel instructed by Duncan Lewis &
Co
For the Respondent:    Mr I Richards, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1. The Appellant is a national of Iran. He applied for asylum in the  United
   Kingdom and asked to be recognised as a refugee. The Respondent  rejected
   his claim to be in need of international protection in a letter  dated  9
   October 2015 and made a decision to remove him under section  10  of  the
   Immigration and Asylum Act 1999.  The  Appellant  appealed  against  that
   decision under section 82 (1) of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum
   Act 2002. His appeal was dismissed by First-tier Tribunal Judge Price  in
   a decision promulgated on 4 April 2016. The Appellant  sought  permission
   to appeal against this decision and permission was granted by  First-tier
   Tribunal Judge Ford on the grounds that the Appellant raised the issue of
   whether the guidance given in SB (risk on return - illegal exit) Iran  CG
   2009 UKAIT 00053 should be followed and this did not appear to have  been
   dealt with in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.


   The Grounds


2. The Appellant asserts in the grounds of appeal  that  objective  material
   in the Appellant's bundle indicated  that  the  situation  facing  failed
   asylum seekers on return to Iran had deteriorated dramatically  and  that
   the country guidance case of SB should not be followed. It  is  submitted
   that the First-tier Tribunal "slavishly" followed the principle  set  out
   in SB and that this amounts to  a  material  error  of  law  because  the
   Tribunal should have departed from the  Country  Guidance  in  accordance
   with the principles set out in DSG & Others (Afghan Sikhs: departure from
   CG) Afghanistan [2013] UKUT (IAC). The grounds argue that due to the lack
   of evidence of treatment of asylum seeker returnees inferences should  be
   drawn from the general  country  situation.  It  is  submitted  that  the
   European Court of Human Rights in the case of  SF  and  Others  v  Sweden
   states that Iranians returning from abroad are  screened  on  arrival  in
   Iran and some of the factors which may lead to an inquiry by the  Iranian
   authorities on return include  being  of  "Kurdish  and  Persian  origin,
   culturally active and well-educated". It is submitted that the First-tier
   Tribunal  failed  to  consider  the  evidence  before  it,   namely   the
   Respondent's  own  guidance  suggested  that  the  Appellant   would   be
   imprisoned for illegally exiting Iran.


   The Rule 24 Response


3. The Respondent submits in the R24 response that  the  Judge  referred  to
   submissions made for the Appellant as to why BA Iran CG  [2011]  UKUT  36
   and SB should not be followed and concluded that there was no  compelling
   reason for him to depart from  the  Country  Guidance  case  of  SB.  The
   relevant country guidance cases have not been overturned  and  the  judge
   concluded, as it was open to him to  do,  that  he  should  follow  their
   ratio. It is argued that the grounds amount to a mere  disagreement  with
   the judge's correct approach and it is respectfully submitted that it  is
   not clear why permission to appeal has been granted.




   The Hearing

4. Ms Pickering submitted that  as  the  country  guidance  of  SSH  and  HR
   (Illegal exit: failed asylum seeker) Iran CG [2016] UKUT 00308 post-dated
   the Judge's decision one had to look at whether there was an error of law
   in relation to the First-tier  Tribunal's  decision  and  not  at  events
   subsequent to it. The second  point  was  whether  the  errors  had  been
   material and she sought to persuade me that they would be in the light of
   the comments at paragraph 23 of the country guidance in SSH and  HR.  She
   relied on the grounds that  had  been  submitted  by  Duncan  Lewis.  She
   submitted that the Judge had erred in his approach in paragraphs 41 to 49
   of the decision. The  Judge  had  applied  SB  and  BA  by  rote  without
   appreciating the arguments.  A skeleton  argument  was  submitted  before
   First-tier Tribunal. The salient parts were from paragraphs  13  onwards.
   What was being raised was not on all fours  with  the  case  of  SB.  The
   argument that was being advanced was that there was a material change  in
   the country conditions that would suggest that there was now a real  risk
   that returnees from the United Kingdom who were forcibly  returned  would
   be interrogated about their United Kingdom  based  activities  and  as  a
   consequence of that there would be a real risk. SB looked at the issue of
   illegal exit but in relation to ordinary returnees and not failed  asylum
   seekers. Where the Judge had erred was in jumping  to  the  illegal  exit
   issue and not giving an analysis of  country  conditions  in  respect  of
   failed asylum seekers. Within the Appellant's bundle there was an article
   dealing with that matter at pages  92-95  from  the  Immigration  Refugee
   Board of Canada which dealt with the position  of  claimants  and  family
   members who had left Iran and claimed refugee status. She could  not  see
   reference to  the  background  information  in  decision.  Where  it  was
   material to the argument it should be considered.  There was an error  of
   law in respect of SB. It was a material point.


5. Mr Richards relied on the R24 response. He submitted that  there  was  no
   material error of law given that the Judge had found that  the  Appellant
   had not participated in any activities that would place him at  risk.  He
   could only succeed because he was at  risk  as  someone  who  had  exited
   illegally per se. He concluded properly  that  there  was  no  reason  to
   depart from the country guidance. The appeal was  properly  dismissed  on
   that basis. Even if the consideration  of  the  case  were  in  some  way
   deficient, any error of law  fallen  into  by  the  Judge  could  not  be
   material with the promulgation of the  recent  country  guidance  on  the
   specific issue at headnote (b). Notably the two Appellants in SSH and  HR
   were Iranian Kurds as was this Appellant. Had the  judge  been  aware  of
   this it would only have reinforced his or  her  conclusions.  He  or  she
   could not have been aware of the new country guidance  but  in  terms  of
   materiality this in effect sealed matters and he asked me  to  find  that
   the First-tier determination should stand.

6. In reply Miss Pickering submitted that SB at paragraph 51 reinforced  the
   point. It was ordinary detainees that were considered. With regard to the
   second point, that if the Judge had had the decision it would have led to
   the same conclusion, it would not have. We had to look at  the  guidance.
   Paragraph 23 was the pertinent point  for  this  Appellant  and  referred
   previous activities either in Iran or United Kingdom. There  would  be  a
   risk  of  further  questioning,  detention  and  ill-treatment.  It   was
   understandable why the Upper Tribunal framed the headnote in the way they
   did. Paragraph 23 recognised that there are three  categories  that  gave
   rise to a  concern.  It  was  accepted  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  at
   paragraph 38 that he was a member of an environmental group in collective
   action in respect of Iran. There was a comment  about  Facebook  activity
   and it was interesting what the Judge observed. The Judge did not find it
   did not exist but was not evidence of continuing activity. Where  someone
   had engaged in social media and Facebook it would lead  to  interrogation
   and further ill-treatment as envisaged at  paragraph  23.  It  was  still
   material.


7. Ms Pickering and Mr Richards concurred that disposal in the event that  I
   found there was an error of law would be by  way  of  submissions  rather
   than fresh hearing or remittal.

   Discussion and Findings


8. The alleged error of law in this case is  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
   erred in failing to depart from the relevant country guidance. In  DSG  &
   Others (Afghan Sikhs: departure from CG) Afghanistan  [2013]  UKUT  00148
   the Upper Tribunal held that the  First-tier  Tribunal  had  justified  a
   departure from this country guidance, which  was  permitted  to  be  done
   according to the Practice Direction  12.2  and  12.4  and  the  UT  (IAC)
   Guidance Note.


9. Practice Direction 12.2 and 12.4 state as follows:

         "12.2 A reported determination of the  Tribunal,  the  AIT  or  IAT
             bearing the letters 'CG' shall be treated as an  authoritative
             finding on  the  country  guidance  issue  identified  in  the
             determination, based upon the evidence before the  members  of
             the Tribunal, the AIT or the IAT that  determine  the  appeal.
             As a result,  unless  it  has  been  expressly  superseded  or
             replaced by any later 'CG' determination, or  is  inconsistent
             with other authority that is binding on the Tribunal,  such  a
             country guidance case is authority in any subsequent appeal so
             far as that appeal:-


             (a)       relates to the country guidance issue  in  question;
             and


             (b)       depends upon the same or similar evidence.


         12.4 Because of the principle that like cases should be treated  in
             like  manner,  any  failure  to  follow  a  clear,  apparently
             applicable country guidance case or to show why  it  does  not
             apply to the case in question is  likely  to  be  regarded  as
             grounds for appeal on a point of law."

10. In the Upper Tribunal Immigration and Asylum Chamber Guidance Note  2011
   No 2, at paragraph 11, it is stated:

         '"If there is credible fresh evidence relevant to  the  issue  that
         has not been considered in the  country  guidance  case  or,  if  a
         subsequent  case  includes  further  issues  that  have  not   been
         considered in the CG case, the judge  will  reach  the  appropriate
         conclusion on the evidence, taking into account the  conclusion  in
         the CG case so far as it remains relevant."

   And at paragraph 12:

         "Where  country  guidance  has  become  outdated   by   reason   of
         developments in the country in question, it is anticipated  that  a
         judge of the First-tier Tribunal  will  have  such  credible  fresh
         evidence as envisaged in paragraph 11 above."


11. The Upper Tribunal has promulgated new country guidance in  relation  to
   illegal and exit and failed asylum seekers  in  Iran  subsequent  to  the
   decision of the First-tier Tribunal in this case. The First-tier Tribunal
   did not have the benefit of this guidance and  the  issue  before  me  is
   whether the Tribunal erred on the  evidence  before  it.  The  First-tier
   Tribunal made a number of findings of fact which have not  been  impugned
   by the grounds of appeal which take issue only with the treatment of  the
   evidence in relation to illegal exit from Iran. The  First-tier  Tribunal
   found that  the  Appellant  was  not  a  credible  witness.  It  was  the
   Appellant's case that he had come to the adverse attention of the Iranian
   authorities because of his political opinion and had attended  a  protest
   held in Marivan against the execution of Kurdish political prisoners  and
   that he was arrested, detained for 27 days, interrogated and beaten.  The
   First-tier Tribunal did  not  accept  his  account  and  found  that  the
   Appellant had not engaged in political activities  and  that  whilst  the
   Appellant may well have been a member of the Sabz Chia Group  this  group
   did not engage in political activities.


12. Leave was granted on the ground that the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  not
   deal with the argument that SB  should  not  be  followed.  That  is  not
   correct. It is clear that the First-tier Tribunal  both  apprehended  the
   Appellant's arguments in the  skeleton  argument  and  dealt  with  those
   arguments. He firstly addressed himself on the relevant country  guidance
   cases correctly noting the relevant headnote  of  SB  which  states  that
   Iranians facing enforced return do not in general face  a  real  risk  of
   persecution or ill-treatment and that this remains the case even if  they
   exited Iran illegally. Having exited Iran illegally is not a  significant
   risk factor, although if  it  is  the  case  that  a  person  would  face
   difficulties with the authorities for other reasons, such a history could
   be a factor adding to the level of difficulties he or she  is  likely  to
   face.

13. The First-tier Tribunal  also  summarised  the  findings  in  BA.  After
   summarising this evidence the Judge noted the Appellant's submission that
   the country guidance case SB no longer represented the  current  position
   and that he was able to depart from the guidance. He then referred to the
   evidence that was  relied  on  to  in  support  of  the  submission.  The
   Appellant's skeleton argument relied on the Respondent's  document  Iran:
   illegal Exit (January 2016). He had specific regard to that evidence  and
   noted the policy summary therein, namely that the consequences of illegal
   departure from Iran were not of themselves  sufficiently  serious  as  to
   warrant international protection. The evidence  he  was  referred  to  at
   paragraph 3.15.5  of  the  UK  Home  Office  Border  Agency,  Operational
   Guidance Note:  Iran  (v8.0  October  2012)  was  summarised  by  him  at
   paragraph 44 of the decision. That evidence stated that any  Iranian  who
   left the country illegally, without a valid passport  or  similar  travel
   documents would be sentenced to between one and three year's imprisonment
   or would receive a find between 100,000 and 500,000  Rials  (�6-�30).  He
   also noted evidence to which he was  not  specifically  referred  by  the
   Appellant at paragraph 3.15.6  of  the  same  document  where  Mirfakhar,
   Director General, Consular Affairs, Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs  noted
   that a person who had left Iran illegally and who is  not  registered  on
   the list of people who cannot leave Iran will not face problems with  the
   authorities on return though the person may be fined. He also  noted  the
   evidence that he was referred to on prison conditions.


14. Miss Pickering  made  the  submission  before  me  that  the  First-tier
   Tribunal did not refer to the report from  the  Immigration  and  Refugee
   Board of Canada at page 92 of the Appellant's bundle in  considering  the
   evidence on the treatment of failed refugees. Firstly, the Appellant  did
   not refer to this evidence in his skeleton argument nor  does  the  Judge
   appear to have been directed to it in  submissions.  Secondly,  there  is
   nothing in the section on failed refugees that shows that a failed asylum
   seeker with no political profile would be at risk. Miss Pickering did not
   refer me to any evidence to show that and I can see none. I find no force
   in the argument that the Judge simply considered whether he should depart
   from the country guidance on the basis of the evidence  on  illegal  exit
   and not on the basis  of  the  evidence  in  relation  to  failed  asylum
   seekers.

15. Ms Pickering also submitted that SB looked at the issue of illegal  exit
   but in relation to ordinary returnees and not failed asylum seekers. I do
   not consider this submission has merit. SB was an asylum seeker. I do not
   consider that it can be  said  that  the  evidence  examined  in  SB  and
   conclusions reached by the  Upper  Tribunal  related  to  only  "ordinary
   returnees". The First-tier tribunal found in this case that the Appellant
   had no relevant history, his account having been found to be  untrue  and
   having been found to have no political  profile.  That  finding  was  not
   challenged by the Appellant in the grounds of appeal and hence I consider
   that it is not open now to argue that the  Appellant  would  be  at  risk
   because of his Face Book activities which, in any event,  were  found  by
   the Judge not to  form  reliable  evidence  of  the  Appellant's  claimed
   political activity.

16. The First-tier Tribunal clearly apprehended the argument,  evidence  and
   the test to be  applied  in  departing  from  the  country  guidance.  He
   properly addressed himself that a compelling reason  would  be  required.
   It was open to him on the evidence which he fully considered to find that
   there was no such reason to depart from the country guidance. I therefore
   find that there was no error of law in the  decision  of  the  First-tier
   Tribunal.


17. The country guidance in SSH  and  HR  would  not,  in  any  event,  have
   availed the Appellant in the light of the findings of fact of the  First-
   tier Tribunal. He was, on those findings, an Iranian male in  respect  of
   whom no adverse interest had been manifested by  the  Iranian  state  and
   therefore would not face a real risk of persecution on return on  account
   of having left illegally or being a failed asylum seeker.

Conclusions:

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.

I do not set aside the decision.

Anonymity
The First-tier Tribunal made an order and I continue  that  order  (pursuant
to rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal)  Rules  2008).  Unless
and until a Tribunal or court directs otherwise, the  appellant  is  granted
anonymity.  No report of these  proceedings  shall  directly  or  indirectly
identify him or any member of his family.  This direction  applies  both  to
the appellant and to the respondent.  Failure to comply with this  direction
could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
