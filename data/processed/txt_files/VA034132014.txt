                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the Secretary of State's appeal against the decision  of  Judge
    McGrade made following a hearing at Glasgow on 29th April 2015.

Background

 2. The claimant is a  citizen  of  the  Gambia.   She  applied  for  entry
    clearance to come to the UK as a visitor to  see  her  fianc�  but  was
    refused on 28th May 2014  on  the  grounds  that  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer was not satisfied that she was genuinely  seeking  entry  as  a
    visitor for a limited period as stated by her nor that she intended  to
    leave the UK at the end of the period of the visit.

 3. The claimant is a 20 year old student who worked in a bar in the Gambia
    where she met her  sponsor  Mr  Tattersall  who  was  on  holiday.   Mr
    Tattersall is 70 years old and a widower and  therefore  50  years  her
    senior. The Entry Clearance Officer was not satisfied that there was  a
    genuine relationship between them.

 4. The judge concluded that the couple, as at the date of  decision,  were
    engaged and planned to marry.  In fact, since the  decision  was  made,
    they have married and Mr Tattersall is presently in the Gambia.

 5. The judge said that it was entirely understandable  that  the  claimant
    wanted to visit the UK in order to meet her fianc�'s friend and  family
    and to get a better understanding of his life here.  He  was  satisfied
    that she met the substantive requirements  of  the  Rules  relating  to
    visit visas, and accepted that she wanted to return to  the  Gambia  in
    order to complete her studies.   He noted that the sponsor  had  around
    �350,000 in savings.  He allowed the appeal on human rights grounds.

The Grounds of Application

 6. The Entry Clearance Officer sought permission to appeal on the  grounds
    that the judge had not adequately reasoned his finding that family life
    existed between the claimant and sponsor.  The couple  had  only  lived
    together for six months and there was a  50  year  age  gap.   Even  if
    family life were to be accepted there was no  reason  why  the  sponsor
    could not visit the claimant.  The Entry Clearance  Officer's  decision
    does nothing to change the status quo.

Submissions

 7. Mr Diwnycz relied on his grounds.

 8. Mr Simo submitted that the judge was entitled  to  reach  the  decision
    that he did.  He relied on the decision in Mostafa (Article 8 in  entry
    clearance) [2015] UKUT 00112 which held in paragraph 24:

         "It is the very essence of Article 8 that it lays down  fundamental
         values that have to be considered in all relevant cases.  It  would
         therefore be extremely foolish to attempt to be prescriptive, given
         the intensely factual and contextual sensitivity of every case ...

         If a person's circumstances do satisfy the  Immigration  Rules  and
         they have not  acted  in  a  way  that  undermines  the  system  of
         immigration control, a refusal of  entry  clearance  is  liable  to
         infringe Article 8."

 9. The claimant clearly met the  requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules
    since she provided evidence in her application  that  she  was  seeking
    entry clearance to come to the UK for a period  of  three  months  only
    during the student holidays.  She intended to leave the UK at  the  end
    and provided relevant documentary evidence.



Findings and Conclusions

10. Given the age gap between the couple it  is  not  surprising  that  the
    Entry Clearance Officer had some  doubts  about  the  strength  of  the
    relationship.  However the judge dealt with the specific points  raised
    in the refusal decision, observing that it was unsurprising that  there
    was little documentary evidence of the relationship since it  had  only
    lasted for six months and for most  of  that  period  the  couple  were
    together in the Gambia.  He was satisfied that she had an incentive  to
    return, namely to complete her studies, and that her sponsor  had  more
    than sufficient funds to pay for her.  There was also a good reason for
    the visit, namely the claimant's desire to meet the  sponsor's  family.
    Those matters are all relevant to a decision under paragraph 41 of  the
    immigration rules, but challenges to those decisions cannot be made  by
    way of an appeal to the tribunal. The only ground upon which an  appeal
    may be brought is that the decision infringes  the  appellant's  rights
    under the ECHR.

11. The first question to be addressed is whether Article 8 of the ECHR  is
    engaged at all.  If not the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to embark upon
    an assessment of the decision of the ECO under the Rules and should not
    do so (Adjei (visit visas - Article 8) [2015] UKUT 0261).   Accordingly
    the decision in Mostafa will only be relevant in assessing the issue of
    proportionality should that stage be reached.

12. The question of whether family life exists in this case is  a  question
    of fact and depends on the real existence of close personal ties.   The
    stability and length of the relationship need to be  assessed  together
    with the parties' intentions.  Cohabitation is  normally  although  not
    necessarily a requirement.

13. The sponsor and claimant met in November 2013 where she was employed as
    a bar attendant.  They began a relationship and he met her family.   He
    said in his statement that he was told by the claimant's mother that he
    had to marry her before they could live together.  He then proposed  to
    her and invited her to come to the UK during her school holiday period.
     They submitted the application for the visit visa when the sponsor was
    in Gambia.  When he returned to the UK he kept in contact with her  and
    sent her money.  As at the date of his witness statement, in March 2015
    they were still engaged, but they have since married.

14.  As  at  the  date  of  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer's  decision  the
    relationship was in its infancy.  The couple  had  only  met  some  six
    months previously and it is not at all clear whether they  were  living
    together during that period.

15. Although the relationship  had  started,  and  the  couple  have  since
    married, at  that  point  it  could  not  properly  be  said  that  the
    relationship equated to the status of husband and wife.

16. The judge was entitled to  come  to  a  different  view  to  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer as to the genuineness of the relationship, and indeed
    subsequent events appear to have proved him right, but  that  does  not
    equate to a proper finding that as at the date of the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer's decision Article 8 was engaged on the basis that  the  couple
    enjoyed family life together.  The judge appears to  have  concentrated
    on whether the relationship was a genuine one rather  than  on  whether
    the couple enjoyed family life at the date of the refusal.

17. Accordingly the judge was not entitled to allow the appeal on Article 8
    grounds since family life  was  not  established.   The  situation  has
    clearly changed in that the couple do now appear to  have  married  and
    accordingly on a re-application Article 8 would be engaged. Moreover on
    the judge's findings it may well be that on  a  second  application  an
    Entry Clearance Officer would find that the substantive requirements of
    the Immigration Rules with respect to visitors would be met.

Decision

The original judge erred in law.  His decision is set aside.  The  following
decision is substituted.  The appeal is dismissed.

No anonymity direction is made.
