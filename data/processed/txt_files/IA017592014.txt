                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction and Background

 1. The Secretary of State appeals against a decision of Judge of the First-
    tier Tribunal Chambers promulgated on 12th November 2014.

 2. The Respondent before the Upper Tribunal was the Appellant  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal and I will refer to her as the Claimant.

 3. The Claimant is a female Jamaican citizen born 16th August 1966 who  on
    1st November 2013 applied for leave to remain  in  the  United  Kingdom
    based upon her long residence, and her family and private life.

 4. The application was refused on 11th  December  2013  the  Secretary  of
    State refusing to vary leave to remain,  and  deciding  to  remove  the
    Claimant from the United Kingdom.

 5. The Claimant's appeal was heard by Judge Chambers (the  judge)  on  4th
    November 2014.  The judge found that the  Claimant  had  at  least  ten
    years' continuous lawful residence in the United  Kingdom  and  allowed
    the appeal under the Immigration  Rules  with  reference  to  paragraph
    276B.  The judge went on to consider Article 8  of  the  1950  European
    Convention  on  Human  Rights  (the  1950   Convention)   outside   the
    Immigration Rules, and  also  allowed  the  appeal  with  reference  to
    Article 8.

 6. The Secretary of State applied for permission to appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal.  In summary it was contended that  the  judge  had  erred  in
    finding that the Claimant had at least  ten  years'  continuous  lawful
    residence.  It was contended  that  the  Claimant  entered  the  United
    Kingdom on 16th October 1999 as a visitor with leave valid  until  15th
    April 2000.  The Claimant was subsequently  granted  further  leave  to
    remain as a student valid from 27th April 2000 until 31st July 2001.

 7. During that period  the  Claimant  had  left  the  United  Kingdom  and
    returned to Jamaica, and on her return to the United  Kingdom  in  July
    2000, her leave was suspended and she was granted temporary  admission.
    It was contended that the Claimant's leave as a student was  reinstated
    in August 2000.

 8. It was therefore submitted that between July 2001 when  the  Claimant's
    student leave expired, and May 2013, when she was granted discretionary
    leave to remain for a period of six months, the Claimant had  no  leave
    to remain and was an overstayer and the judge was wrong  to  find  that
    she had been lawfully  resident  in  the  United  Kingdom  during  that
    period.

 9. It was contended that the judge had erred in finding that she  remained
    on temporary admission  for  that  period,  and  for  the  purposes  of
    paragraph 276B, temporary admission does not qualify as lawful leave.

10. In the alternative it was contended that even if it  was  accepted,  as
    claimed by the Claimant, that she was never informed that her leave  as
    a student was reinstated in August 2000, and she was  never  told  that
    her temporary admission ended, then she nevertheless would not have had
    any leave after the expiry of her student leave in July 2001.

11. In relation to Article 8 it was contended that the judge had  erred  by
    failing to follow the guidance in  Gulshan  Pakistan  [2013]  UKUT  640
    (IAC), and the judge's error in finding that the Claimant had  remained
    in the United Kingdom lawfully for ten years  infected  his  Article  8
    proportionality assessment.

12. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Denson who found the grounds arguable.

13. Directions were issued making provision  for  there  to  be  a  hearing
    before the Upper Tribunal to decide  whether  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    decision should be set aside.

The Secretary of State's Submissions

14. Mr Harrison relied upon the grounds contained  within  the  application
    for permission to appeal and had no further oral submissions to make.

The Claimant's Submissions

15. Miss Thomas submitted that the judge had not erred in law and that  the
    decision should stand.  I was asked to find that the judge was entitled
    to conclude that the Claimant had accrued more than ten  years'  lawful
    residence in the United Kingdom and in relation to Article  8,  Gulshan
    was not the appropriate test and the judge had  not  erred  in  law  in
    considering and  allowing  the  appeal  under  Article  8  outside  the
    Immigration Rules.

My Conclusions and Reasons

16. I firstly consider the Secretary of State's submission  that  temporary
    admission  does  not  qualify  as   lawful   leave.    I   asked   both
    representatives whether they had any submissions to make on  this,  and
    neither did.  I have not been provided with any  authority  to  confirm
    that temporary admission does not qualify as lawful leave.

17. Lawful residence is defined in paragraph  276A(b)  of  the  Immigration
    Rules, and it includes temporary admission within  section  11  of  the
    Immigration Act 1971 where leave to enter  or  remain  is  subsequently
    granted.

18. In this case it is common ground that leave to remain was  subsequently
    granted to the Claimant, and she was granted leave to  remain  on  16th
    May 2013 until 16th November 2013.  Therefore in  the  absence  of  any
    authority to the contrary, I  find  that  the  judge  was  entitled  to
    consider temporary admission as  lawful  residence,  and  that  limited
    leave to remain was subsequently granted.  I therefore find no material
    error on this point.

19. I next consider the contention that the judge was wrong  to  find  that
    temporary admission, which was granted to the Claimant  in  July  2000,
    continued thereafter for at least ten years.  The judge considered  the
    history of this case, and the evidence that had been  supplied.   I  do
    not find that the judge failed to consider any  material  evidence,  or
    took into account any immaterial matters.  The  judge  found  that  the
    evidence did not indicate that the Secretary of State  in  August  2000
    reinstated the Claimant's student leave  which  expired  on  31st  July
    2001.  The judge did not find any evidence to indicate that the student
    leave had been reinstated, and was entitled to find that  the  evidence
    indicated the contrary, and to accept the Claimant's  explanation  that
    she had never been served  with  any  notice  reinstating  her  student
    leave.

20.  The  judge  accepted  the  Claimant's  evidence  that  she   and   her
    representatives had made efforts to contact the Respondent  to  clarify
    her  immigration  status,  and  that  her  temporary  admission  status
    continued.  The judge noted in paragraph 30 of his  decision,  that  in
    October 2012 an appeal against an earlier decision was adjourned at the
    Respondent's request in order to investigate the Claimant's immigration
    status, and that further interviews with the Claimant  were  conducted,
    and in April 2013 the Secretary of State withdrew a decision because of
    uncertainty as to the Claimant's immigration status.

21. The judge found it common ground that the  Claimant  had  been  granted
    temporary admission on 20th July  2000,  and  was  entitled  to  accept
    evidence that this status was never revoked and continued for in excess
    of ten years before the Claimant was granted limited leave to remain in
    May 2013.

22. This is an extremely unusual situation, but in my view  the  judge  was
    entitled to reach the conclusions  that  he  did  in  relation  to  the
    Claimant's lawful residence, and did not err in law in so  doing.   The
    decision to allow the appeal under the Immigration Rules in relation to
    lawful residence stands.

23. In relation to Article 8, I note that the judge records at paragraph 26
    that the Secretary of State's representative specifically  agreed  that
    it was appropriate to consider Article 8 outside the Immigration Rules,
    and recorded at paragraph 36 that he was invited by both parties to the
    appeal to consider Article 8.

24. In my view the case law has moved on following Gulshan, and  I  do  not
    find that Gulshan now sets out the  appropriate  test.   The  Court  of
    Appeal in MM and Others [2014] EWCA Civ 985 stated at paragraph 135;

         135.  Where  the  relevant  group  of  IRs,   upon   their   proper
             construction, provide a "complete code"  for  dealing  with  a
             person's Convention rights in the context of a  particular  IR
             or statutory provision,  such  as  in  the  case  of  "foreign
             criminals", then  the  balancing  exercise  and  the  way  the
             various factors are to be taken into account in an  individual
             case must be done  in  accordance  with  that  code,  although
             references to "exceptional circumstances"  in  the  code  will
             nonetheless entail a proportionality  exercise.   But  if  the
             relevant group of IRs is not such a "complete code"  then  the
             proportionality test will be more at large, albeit  guided  by
             the Huang tests and the UK and Strasbourg case law.

25. The Court of Appeal in Singh [2015] EWCA Civ 74 recorded;

         3.   It is now settled that the right course in any case  where  an
             applicant relies on his or her private or family  life  is  to
             proceed by considering first whether leave should  be  granted
             under the relevant provisions of the new Rules and only if the
             answer is no to go on to consider Article 8 in its unvarnished
             form (the so called "two-stage approach"):  see  the  line  of
             cases which includes Izuazu (Article 8  -  new  Rules)  [2013]
             UKUT 45 (IAC) and R (Nagre) v Secretary of State for the  Home
             Department [2013] EWHC 7200 (Admin) to which I  will  have  to
             refer more fully below.  Thus Article 8  claims  "outside  the
             Rules"  are  still  possible,  though  the  scope  for   their
             operation is reduced.

26. In this appeal,  the  judge  did  not  consider  Article  8  under  the
    Immigration Rules, those being Appendix FM in relation to family  life,
    and paragraph 276ADE in relation to private life, and in my view should
    have done, even though invited  by  both  representatives  to  consider
    Article 8 outside the rules.  The judge  should  only  have  considered
    Article 8 outside the rules once he had considered family  and  private
    life within the rules.  I therefore conclude that the  judge  erred  in
    his consideration of Article 8, but I do not  find  this  error  to  be
    material because the appeal has  been  allowed  under  the  Immigration
    Rules in relation to ten years' continuous lawful  residence,  and  was
    only allowed under Article 8 in the alternative.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve  the  making  of  an
error on a point of law such that the decision must be set aside.

I do not set aside the decision and the appeal of the Secretary of State  is
dismissed.

Anonymity

No anonymity order was made by the First-tier Tribunal.  There has  been  no
request for anonymity to the Upper Tribunal and no anonymity order is  made.
