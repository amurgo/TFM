Representation:

For the appellant:     Mr I Waka of Counsel
For the respondent:    Ms J Isherwood, Senior Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1. The appellant, a national of Turkey born on 17 July 1990, appeals to  the
   Upper Tribunal against the determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
   Devitte dated 15 January  2014.  This  appeal  was  brought  against  the
   respondent's decision refusing to grant him entry clearance for a  family
   visit to his claimed sister and brother in law pursuant to  paragraph  41
   of the Immigration Rules.

2. First-tier Judge Pooler granted the appellant permission to appeal  on  3
   April 2014 finding that the First-tier Tribunal had arguably fallen  into
   error which the grounds sufficiently demonstrate as the judge  failed  to
   make any reference to the evidence of the appellant's sponsor as  to  the
   appellant's circumstances in Turkey.

3. Thus the appeal came before me.

Error of Law

4. The ECO refused the appellant's application  in  reliance  on  paragraphs
   41(i), (ii), (vii) and (v) of the Immigration Rules.

5. At the hearing, it was agreed  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  at
   paragraph 3 set out the wrong reasons for  refusal  letter.  The  refusal
   letter set out there in bears no resemblance to the refusal letter by the
   respondent dated 25 June which has surprisingly gone unnoticed until  the
   hearing. It was accepted that this constitutes a material error of law in
   the determination of the First-tier Tribunal and that it  should  be  set
   aside.

6. I therefore set aside the determination in its entirety  and  rehear  the
   appeal.

Re-making of decision

7. Mr Haci Ekinici gave  oral  evidence  at  the  hearing  and  adopted  his
   statement dated 17 November 2013. He gave the following evidence  in  his
   examination in chief which I summarise. The appellant's brother  in  law.
   The person at the back of the court is his wife and the appellant sister.
   The appellant wants to visit them because he and his  wife  promised  him
   that they will take him to watch football. They have two children aged  8
   and 2. The appellant is studying in Turkey and he is in his second  year.
   He has applied for a government job and is  going  to  take  their  entry
   exams and if he passes, this means he will get a job straight  away  with
   the government. The document at page 9A in the  bundle  states  that  the
   appellant  is  studying  for  an  economic  degree  from  2012-2014.  The
   appellant lives with his parents and they have a bakery which they  sold.
   His father has a pension. At pages 18-19, the document demonstrates  that
   his father gets approximately �300 every month.  He  has  a  brother  and
   sister who are both married. The  appellant's  parents  sold  the  bakery
   because they are getting old and they have to  get  up  at  4.30  in  the
   morning. At page 20-21 is a document from a jewellery  with  states  that
   his mother's jewellery worth 11,000 Turkish Lira was sold and  money  was
   put into the appellant's bank account. The appellant has  the  equivalent
   of �4000 in his bank account. He will bring �1000 with him to the country
   but he will not spend all of it as he wants to  make  sure  that  he  has
   enough money on him. He works at IMAX cash-and-carry. His payslips are at
   page 43. He also used to do his own business. After 2012 he went to  work
   for another company and his P60 has been  submitted.  He  earns  �1250  a
   month.  The  Housing  Department  put   his   family   in   a   temporary
   accommodation. The Housing Association said that it would be okay for the
   appellant to come and live with them as a visitor. He has  a  two-bedroom
   house with a kitchen. The appellant would return  to  Turkey  because  he
   cannot look after him. The appellant has also got exams  at  the  end  of
   September.

8. In cross examination the appellant sponsor gave  the  following  evidence
   which I summarise. He was asked whether there is any evidence that he  is
   related to the appellant's sister. He said they  have  two  children  but
   accepted he has not provided their birth certificates  but  has  provided
   their passports. He  was  asked  why  he  has  not  provided  a  marriage
   certificate or a birth certificate for his children. He replied that they
   have provided a document which depicts their family tree.  He  was  asked
   why this issue of relationship has not been addressed given that it was a
   point raised in the reasons for refusal letter. He said that he  was  not
   asked the question.

9. They both have a surname in common  even  though  the  appellant  is  his
   brother-in-law. The sponsor said "if you can give me  time  I  can  prove
   everything to you. He is my brother in law". It was put  to  the  sponsor
   that the documents he has provided some of them  are  not  translated  to
   which he responded that his previous solicitor "did not do  that  and  he
   does not know about these things". He said that  the  previous  solicitor
   was after their money. They have not lodged  a  complaint  against  their
   previous solicitor.

10. The appellant started his current course in September 2013. It  was  put
   to the sponsor that the appellant started his current  course  after  the
   respondent's refusal of his application. The sponsor  said  "yes  he  was
   studying economic any applied for a visitor  visa  between  courses".  He
   accepted that at the time of the application the appellant was not  doing
   the current course but was doing a computing course.

11. In June 2013 he was working as a waiter and  is  now  employed  at  IMAX
   cash-and-carry. He was paid �160 a week and was receiving tax credits for
   two years. He has two bedrooms and a living  room.  The  appellant  would
   sleep in the other room because his children still sleep with him and his
   wife.

12. In re-examination the appellant said that  the  date  of  enrolment  was
   October 2012 and now the appellant is  studying  GPPS  (government  entry
   exams) which is started 14 days after  the  decision.  His  evidence  for
   proof of relationship is at page 23 and 25 in  that  they  have  provided
   passports.

13. I asked the sponsor why it is important for the appellant to visit  them
   in the United Kingdom and why they cannot visit him in Turkey. He replied
   that they went to Turkey to visit him in 2011.

14. I heard submissions from both parties and the full notes of the  hearing
   are in my Record of Proceedings.

   Findings


15. The issues in the appeal are whether the appellant  will  be  maintained
   and accommodated in the United Kingdom without recourse to  public  funds
   and whether he will return to  Turkey  after  her  visit  to  the  United
   Kingdom. The respondent also raise the issue that the appellant  has  not
   demonstrated that he is related to his sponsor in the United Kingdom.


16. In respect of the issue of the appellant's claimed failure to  establish
   that he is  related  to  the  sponsor,  the  appellant  sponsor  provided
   passports  and  a  family  tree.  No  marriage   certificate   or   birth
   certificates of the sponsor's children were provided. I however take into
   account that having provided  passports  and  a  letter  from  the  local
   authority  that  the  appellant  sister  and  brother-in-law  are  living
   together, I find that on a balance  of  probabilities  the  appellant  is
   related to his sponsor  in  the  United  Kingdom.  The  sponsor's  sister
   attended the hearing although she did not give evidence.


17. In respect of whether the appellant can be maintained  and  accommodated
   in the United Kingdom without recourse to public funds, I find  that  the
   appellant sponsor lives in temporary accommodation. He has  two  children
   who are aged eight years and two years old. He said that he  has  a  two-
   bedroom flat and the appellant will live in the other room because  their
   children sleep in their room in any event. No  explanation  was  provided
   for why to children would sleep in  their  parents  room  when  there  is
   another room available. I find  that  the  appellant's  sponsor  is  over
   egging his case to demonstrate that the  appellant  can  be  accommodated
   adequately. I find nevertheless that on the evidence the  appellant  will
   be accommodated by his sponsor without recourse to public funds as a two-
   bedroom property is sufficient for a brief visit.


18. In respect of maintenance the appellant claims that he will bring  �1000
   to the United Kingdom but he will not spend  all  of  it.  The  appellant
   claims that his mother sold her jewellery and put �4000 into his account.
   The appellant provided a translated document from Tekinier Jeweller which
   states that "on 19 May 2013 I bought gold from them  it  cost  me  11,000
   Turkish lira and I paid cash to elif ekinci." The document does not  give
   details of the jewellery bought but  only  states  he  bought  "gold".  I
   therefore place very limited reliance on this document to show  that  the
   appellant's mother sold her jewellery.


19. I therefore do not accept that the money in the appellant's  account  is
   genuinely available to him for his holiday in the United Kingdom. I  find
   that even if  his  mother  sold  jewellery  and  deposited  it  into  the
   appellant account, this was done so that the appellant can  show  a  bank
   balance before his application  for  a  visitor's  visa.  This  makes  me
   enquire why such a drastic step would be taken merely for  the  appellant
   to have a holiday in the United Kingdom. The appellant's parents and  the
   appellant's brother in law are by the all accounts not rich  people.  The
   appellant's brother-in-law was earning �160 a week at  the  date  of  the
   application and therefore to sell �4000 worth of jewellery  and  for  the
   appellant to bring �1000 to the United  Kingdom  for  a  holiday  is  not
   plausible or credible.


20. The evidence also is  that  the  appellant's  parents  have  sold  their
   bakery shop  and  are  reliant  on  his  father's  claimed  pension,  the
   equivalent of �300 a month. A document was provided which states that the
   appellant's father's  pension  is  from  the  "Turkish  Social  Insurance
   Department" which states that the appellant's  father  "get  his  pension
   every month from Ziraat Bank 950.02." I do not find this to be a credible
   document because of  the  lack  of  detail  as  to  how  the  pension  is
   calculated. I therefore place no reliance on this document to  show  that
   the appellant's father has a pension in Turkey.


21.  Furthermore,  no  explanation  has  been  given  for  how  the  Turkish
   authorities  grant  pensions  to  self-employed  people  in  Turkey.  The
   appellant's father was owned his own business and there  is  no  evidence
   before me that self-employed businessman receive a state pension from the
   Turkish Social Insurance Department.



22. The appellant sponsor has two children and a wife to support  with  that
   money. I therefore do not find it credible that the sponsor could  afford
   a holiday for appellant on the money that he earns. I therefore find that
   the appellant has not demonstrated that  he  will  be  able  to  maintain
   himself from his own resources or that of his sponsor for his holiday  in
   the United Kingdom without recourse to public funds.


23. As to the appellant's intention to return to Turkey after  his  visit  I
   take into account the evidence that the appellant has started his  course
   after the refusal letter. The appellant was a student in  Turkey  at  the
   date of his application. I find that this in itself does not  demonstrate
   that the appellant will return to Turkey after his visit.


24. The appellant's parents are retired and have sold their shop because  it
   was explained that they were fed up of getting up at 4.30 in the morning.
   No explanation was provided for why his parents would sell  their  bakery
   from which they earned a good income and why the appellant did  not  take
   over the business but would instead look for a job in the government. The
   mere presence of his parents in Turkey will also  not  in  itself  be  an
   incentive for the appellant to return. The appellant is a young  man  who
   is not married and therefore I find that he does not have sufficient ties
   to Turkey to encourage him to return.


25. Looking at the evidence as a whole, I find it  to  not  be  credible  or
   plausible. I find that the appellant has not demonstrated on a balance of
   probabilities that he is a genuine visitor and that he intends to  return
   to Turkey. I also find that the  appellant  has  not  demonstrated  on  a
   balance of probabilities that he will not be  maintained  in  the  United
   Kingdom without recourse to public funds.

26. I conclude that the appellant has not  on  a  balance  of  probabilities
   demonstrated that he satisfies all of the requirements of paragraph 41 of
   the Immigration Rules.

Decision

For the reasons given above, the determination of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
is set aside.

I remake the decision on appeal and dismissing it.

As the appellant's appeal has been dismissed, I make  no  order  for  a  fee
    award.
