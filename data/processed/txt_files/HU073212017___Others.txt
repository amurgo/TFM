For the Appellants:    Ms M. Malhotra, Counsel instructed by RW Anderson
For the Respondent:    Mr N. Bramble, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellants are all nationals of Pakistan. They are  respectively  a
    mother, father and their minor daughter, born in 2010.    Their  linked
    human rights appeals were dismissed by the First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge
    Garbett) on the 20th March 2018.    They  were  granted  permission  to
    appeal against that decision  on  the  22nd  June  2018  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Haria.

 2. The Appellants seek leave to remain in  the  United  Kingdom  on  human
    rights  grounds.  The  basis  of  their  claim  is  that  the  youngest
    Appellant, R, is suffering from a medical condition for which she would
    not receive treatment or adequate care in Pakistan.   It  is  submitted
    that this lack of provision will result in serious consequences for  R:
    she will be denied an education, could face a  rapid  and  irreversible
    decline in her health and in the worst-case scenario  could  die.   The
    illness is Type I diabetes mellitus.   The family rely on Articles 3  &
    8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).




    The Decision of the First-tier Tribunal

 3. The First-tier Tribunal found that the Appellants  entered  the  United
    Kingdom with leave as Tier 4 Migrants in August  2014,  and  that  this
    leave continues today by virtue of s3C of the Immigration Act 1971.   R
    was diagnosed in May 2015.  The Tribunal accepted as  credible  all  of
    the evidence it heard from the adult Appellants. The  medical  evidence
    in respect of R was unchallenged.  The only factual issue  between  the
    parties was the availability of care and associated support in Pakistan
    for R's condition.  The Tribunal noted that R's  parents  had  gone  to
    some effort to research what care might be available. This had included
    evidence from the first Appellant about an acquaintance of  hers  whose
    daughter N also suffered  from  Type  I.  The  doctors  treating  N  in
    Pakistan had used techniques that were over 50 years old; her condition
    deteriorated and she had died.  The first Appellant's evidence about  N
    was supported by the 'death notes' of her doctor and  sworn  affidavits
    from N's parents who set out in more detail what had happened to  their
    daughter.  The Appellants had also provided various articles and blogs.
    The Respondent had produced  no  country  background  material  on  the
    point.

 4. The Tribunal found [at �25] that the treatment for diabetes in Pakistan
    is more limited than in the United Kingdom; in 2016  the  WHO  reported
    that  insulin  is  not  widely  available,   although   Metformin   and
    Sulphonylurea are.   The Tribunal took judicial notice of the fact that
    these are drugs used to treat Type II  rather  than  Type  I  diabetes.
    Blood glucose measurements are not generally available in primary  care
    settings. The determination then says this:

         "The fact that they are not "generally available" does not  however
         mean that they are not available at all.  I  also  note  that  this
         information is now two years old and the position  may  have  moved
         on. In oral evidence the first Appellant confirmed that insulin  is
         available privately and that a  doctor  in  a  hospital  in  Lahore
         specialises in the treatment of Type I  diabetes  albeit  that  her
         techniques and treatment are not as advanced as those [R] currently
         receives".

 5. As to the efficacy of such treatments, and their  utility  for  R,  the
    Tribunal drew a distinction between her position and that of N and  her
    parents [still at �25]:

         "In  conclusion,  I  accept  that  there  is  a  general   national
         unawareness of type I diabetes in Pakistan.   I  also  accept  that
         there is limited availability of insulin, as well  as  blood  sugar
         testing.  However, there is some availability in  these  Appellants
         have the advantage, if I can put it that way, of knowing  that  [R]
         suffers from this difficult condition which  I  find  distinguishes
         them from the tragic positions that [N] and  her  family  faced  as
         well..."

 6. The Tribunal noted that both  of  the  adult  Appellants  are  educated
    professionals and that they would be able  to  work  in  order  to  pay
    privately for treatment.   They  both  speak  the  language  and  spent
    approximately 30 years of their lives in that country. There  would  be
    disruption to their lives but upon return to Pakistan they  would  have
    the support of family.  As to R's education the Tribunal accepted  that
    because of the general lack of awareness of Type I diabetes in Pakistan
    schools there would not provide the same level of care and support that
    R currently receives here.

 7. Applying these facts as found within the legal framework  the  Tribunal
    found, in respect of Article 8:

      i) That Article 8 was engaged because there would be  an  interference
         with the family's private life here [�35];

     ii) It would be in the best interests of R to remain  in  this  country
         [�36];

    iii) The public interest considerations  at  117B  of  the  Nationality,
         Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 must weigh against  the  Appellants
         [�37];

     iv) Although the family were unaware of R's condition on  arrival  (and
         so cannot be deemed 'health tourists') they have not  been  granted
         leave to remain on health grounds and so the United Kingdom  cannot
         be said to have taken responsibility for R's care;

      v)  Weighing  these  factors  in  the  balance  the  decision  is  not
         disproportionate.

 8. In respect of Article  3  the  Tribunal  directs  itself  to  the  high
    threshold imposed in N v  United  Kingdom  (Application  no.  26565/05)
    (2008) 47 EHRR 39. The determination notes that  the  threshold  to  be
    applied in the case of a child may be different from that of an  adult.
    The Tribunal was not however satisfied that R's condition  has  reached
    such a critical stage that she is dying. Nor  did  it  accept,  on  the
    evidence before it, that medical  treatment  in  Pakistan  is  entirely
    unavailable in Pakistan such that intense suffering or death on  return
    would be imminent.

 9. The appeals were therefore dismissed on all grounds.




    The Challenge

10. At a hearing on the 21st January 2019 the Appellants submitted that the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal was flawed for the following errors
    of law:

      i)  That  the  First-tier  Tribunal's  reasoning  was  premised  on  a
         fundamental misapprehension of the facts;

     ii) The First-tier Tribunal impermissibly speculated that the  position
         in Pakistan may have changed, rather than  relying  on  the  actual
         evidence before it;

    iii) The First-tier Tribunal misdirected itself to the  applicable  test
         in N v United Kingdom (2008) 47 EHRR 39;

     iv) The Tribunal failed to apply  the  N  Article  3  threshold  having
         regard to the young age of the individual concerned;

      v) The decision is flawed for lack of reasons, the Tribunal failing to
         explain why the public interest outweighed R's  best  interests  in
         this case.

11. At the 'error of law' hearing the Respondent was represented by  Senior
    Presenting Officer Mr  Diwnycz  who  substantially  conceded  that  the
    grounds were made out, for the reasons set out below.




    Discussion and Findings on 'Error of Law'

    Ground (i)

12. Ground (i) is that the First-tier Tribunal made  a  material  error  of
    fact in respect of the child 'N'.

13. The passage cited (set out above at my �5) indicates that the  Tribunal
    was under the impression that the cause of N's death,  or  at  least  a
    contributory factor, was that her family and  clinicians  were  unaware
    that she was suffering from Type I diabetes, and  so  administered  the
    wrong treatment. In fact, as Mr Diwnycz concedes, the evidence was that
    N had already been correctly diagnosed with Type I diabetes;  she  died
    because the doctors were unaware of the correct treatment and/or it was
    not available.

14. Ground (i) was therefore made out by consent.

    Ground (ii)

15. Ms Malhotra submitted that the Tribunal  further  erred  in  apparently
    discounting the actual evidence  before  it  on  the  basis  that  "the
    position may have moved  on"  [at  my  �4  above].    Insofar  as  this
    indicated that the Tribunal proceeded on the basis that  matters  might
    have improved in the two years since the WHO  report  etc,  Mr  Diwnycz
    accepted that this too must be an error of law. Whilst  he  points  out
    that the Tribunal did make findings on the actual evidence, he accepted
    that it was an error to base a  risk  assessment  on  speculation  that
    things might improve in the future.

16. Ground (ii) was therefore made out by consent.

    Grounds (iii) & (iv)

17. I take grounds (iii) and (iv) together because they are both  concerned
    with how the Tribunal approached the question of Article 3 and  how  it
    might apply to R's situation.

18. At �41 of the determination the Tribunal concludes:

         "Her medical condition cannot  be  said  to  have  reached  such  a
         critical stage that she is dying. I also do not accept that medical
         treatment is entirely unavailable in  Pakistan  such  that  intense
         suffering or death on return would be imminent".

19. At �42-44 the Tribunal then considers the jurisprudence to  the  effect
    that the N threshold may be lower if one is considering the impact upon
    a child. Having  done  so,  and  having  accepted  the  principle,  the
    Tribunal reiterates:

         "Her medical condition is not so grave that she can be described as
         dying and I do not accept that  there  would  be  an  imminence  of
         intense suffering or death on her return to Pakistan where  I  have
         found there is treatment albeit it that it is more limited".

20. The Appellant submits that these conclusions are flawed for a number of
    reasons.

21. First, they are vitiated by the errors already identified, in that  the
    Tribunal apparently misunderstood the evidence.  Given his  concessions
    in respect of ground (i) and (ii) Mr Diwnycz was bound  too  to  accept
    this criticism. Whilst he maintained that the conclusions reached  may,
    in the final analysis, be open to the determining Tribunal, he accepted
    that in this  fact-sensitive  assessment  it  was  important  that  the
    Tribunal had an accurate understanding of  what  those  facts  actually
    were.

22. Second, it is submitted that the Tribunal  has  elevated  the  test  in
    Article 3 to the bald question of whether  R  is  currently  dying,  or
    would die upon her return to Pakistan. Even if the Judge was not minded
    to  accept  the  'modest  extension'  imported  by  the   decision   in
    Paposhvilli v Belgium (application  number  41738/10)  the  appropriate
    question to ask was whether R would be exposed to inhuman and degrading
    treatment. In N the ECtHR put it like this:

         "42.     Aliens who are subject to expulsion  cannot  in  principle
         claim entitlement to remain in the territory of a contracting state
         in order to continue to benefit from medical, social or other forms
         of assistance and services provided by  the  expelling  state.  The
         fact  that  the  applicant's  circumstances,  including  his   life
         expectancy, would be significantly reduced if he were to be removed
         from the contracting state is not sufficient in itself to give rise
         to breach of art  3.  The  decision  to  remove  an  alien  who  is
         suffering from a serious mental or physical illness  to  a  country
         where the facilities for the treatment of that illness are inferior
         to those available in the contracting  state  may  raise  an  issue
         under art 3, but  only  in  a  very  exceptional  case,  where  the
         humanitarian grounds against the removal are  compelling.  In  D  v
         United Kingdom ... the very exceptional circumstances were that the
         applicant was critically ill and appeared to  be  close  to  death,
         could not be guaranteed any nursing or medical care in his  country
         of origin and had no family there willing or able to care  for  him
         or provide him with even a basic level of food, shelter  or  social
         support.

23. The Appellant submits that by focusing on the  question  of  death  the
    Tribunal impermissibly narrowed the test in N to exclude  consideration
    of whether R would be exposed to inhuman and degrading  treatment;  the
    Tribunal did not ask itself whether, taking into account her young age,
    and its own finding that the family have always had leave and  are  not
    'health tourists', whether the "humanitarian  grounds  against  removal
    are compelling".  Nor were clear  findings  made  on  what  the  likely
    consequences would be for R if she were returned to Pakistan.

24. I am satisfied that this ground is made out. Whether viewed through the
    prism of Article 8 or 3, this was  an  intensely  fact-sensitive  case.
    Nowhere in the reasoning does the Tribunal appear to consider what  the
    actual consequences of removal would be for R.  The  fact  that  "some"
    treatment is available in Pakistan, or the fact that her parents  could
    pay for it, was of little consequence to R if it was  not  the  correct
    treatment, as the tragic case of child N  illustrated.    The  evidence
    indicated that R is currently the recipient  of  a  "complex"  diabetes
    management plan.  Her  parents,  specialist  nurses  and  teachers  are
    checking her blood sugar levels regularly throughout the day,  counting
    her carbohydrates and administering a particular kind of  insulin  that
    is only rarely available in Pakistan.  As the determination records [at
    for instance �6 and 13], it was the clear evidence  of  the  clinicians
    that without this complex management plan, and the particular  form  of
    insulin she requires, this child could die.  Jane Humphries,  the  Lead
    Paediatric Diabetes Specialist Nurse at  Queen's  Hospital,  Burton-on-
    Trent explains that some of the consequences of a failure in management
    would include musculoskeletal  complications,  cardiovascular  disease,
    retinopathy and neuropathy. The evidence concerning Pakistan before the
    Tribunal  was  not  simply  concerned  with  the  availability  of  R's
    particular form of insulin, the  focus  of  �42-44  of  the  Tribunal's
    conclusion, but with the  absence  of  treatment  for  these  attendant
    conditions.   The evidence also appeared to indicate  that  the  "basic
    technologies" required as part of this complex management plan  -  i.e.
    various testing kits,  pumps  etc-  were  not  generally  available  in
    Pakistan [see �17(i)]. I can find in the decision no analysis  of  what
    the consequences would be for R if she were not able  to  access  these
    technologies, nor of what the impact would be for her if her management
    plan broke down, for instance because of a  lack  of  glucose  testing.
    Although the Tribunal has properly directed itself to the  authorities,
    for instance SQ (Pakistan), it is difficult to see that it has  applied
    the principles therein.

    Ground (v)

25. It perhaps follows from what I have said that  the  final  ground  must
    also be made out. If the Tribunal failed to make fact-specific findings
    on what the actual consequences would be for R of return  to  Pakistan,
    it must follow that the proportionality balancing exercise must also be
    set aside.




    The Re-Made Decision

26. At a 'continuance' hearing on the 7th May 2019 I heard  submissions  on
    behalf of both parties. The Appellants' continue to be  represented  by
    Ms Malhotra. On this occasion the  Respondent  was  represented  by  Mr
    Bramble, Senior Presenting Officer. Both parties submitted, with leave,
    further documentary evidence.

    The Evidence

27. The Appellants rely upon what is described as a 'Best Interests Report'
    dated the 4th April 2019 by Independent Social Worker Lynn  Coates.  To
    prepare her report Ms Coates  reviewed  documents  including  the  Home
    Office papers, R's school reports,  character  references  and  medical
    evidence; she further interviewed each member of the family, observed R
    in the home and interviewed R's aunt,  and  Mrs  Tranter,  R's  primary
    school SENDCO.  The salient points to be  drawn  from  the  report  are
    these:

       . Ms Coates observed the family speaking  English  with  each  other,
         supporting the family's contention that R does not speak,  read  or
         write Urdu

       . R wears western clothes and speaks with a Staffordshire accent.  Ms
         Tranter told Ms Coates  that  she  believes  that  R  would  regard
         herself as British; to her  knowledge  she  has  no  experience  of
         Pakistani culture or traditional Muslim practices

       . R left Pakistan at the age of four and told Ms Coates that she  has
         no real memory of the country

       . R's aunt, who formerly taught at  a  private  school  in  Pakistan,
         expressed two concerns about R entering the  school  system  there.
         First, she was doubtful about whether staff would have the training
         or understanding of how to deal with R's condition. Second, in  her
         experience children with such conditions are frequently bullied  by
         peers in Pakistani schools

       . R is currently cared for by the Paediatric Diabetic Team at Queen's
         Hospital

       . As part of that care R is receiving  monthly  CBT  and  counselling
         sessions, the focus of which is to help  her  with  her  "anxieties
         regarding her diagnosis and to assist her in coming to  terms  with
         having a chronic life-long condition"

       . R told Ms Coates that she has a lot of friends, both at school  and
         in her local community. R told her  "I  trust  my  friends  and  my
         teachers they look out for me and make sure that if I need  help  I
         get it, they are kind to me"

       . Ms Tranter told Ms Coates that "four members of staff  are  trained
         to deal with [R]'s diabetes, checking her blood sugar levels  three
         times per day and administering insulin when needed".   Ms  Tranter
         explained to Ms Coates that this monitoring is "essential to ensure
         that [R] is well and safe during the school day"

28. In reaching these findings Ms Coates has  drawn  on  a  wide  range  of
    sources including those independent of the family such as  the  medical
    records and the "detailed" conversation with Ms Tranter. I am therefore
    prepared to place a good deal of weight on these conclusions.  I  place
    no weight on the remainder of the report, in which Ms Coates opines  on
    matters such as the education system in Pakistan, and the  availability
    of healthcare there. Whilst I appreciate that Ms Coates has drawn  upon
    external sources in order to offer this evidence, I am unable  to  give
    her conclusions any weight in my deliberations since she is not, as far
    as I have been made aware, an expert witness.

29. I was further provided with a  letter  directly  from  Ms  Tranter  who
    confirmed that whilst she is at school R requires a "substantial amount
    of care". Her blood sugar levels are checked  regularly  by  staff  who
    administer insulin where necessary. This is routinely  completed  twice
    per day, but more often if R is feeling unwell or during exercise.  The
    staff receive specialist training once per year and have been  assessed
    to ensure that they are competent  in  administering  the  insulin  and
    taking the blood sugar readings. R's carbohydrate intake is weighed  by
    two members of staff according to her blood sugars. The  staff  at  the
    school maintain regular communication with R's diabetes treatment  team
    and her parents.  A letter dated 8th February 2018 from Alyson  Church,
    Assistant Head at R's primary school confirms much of what is  said  by
    Ms Tranter, stressing that staff receive regular  specialised  training
    in how to  manage  R's  condition.  I  note  that  there  is  a  slight
    discrepancy in the evidence in  that  Ms  Tranter  apparently  told  Ms
    Coates that there are four staff members who are so trained, whereas Ms
    Church states it to be six - I am not satisfied that anything turns  on
    that. It may simply be that four are expected to be on site, but as  Ms
    Church states, there are six who receive the training "so that  we  can
    cover absences".  The point consistently  made  is  clear  -  that  the
    school has taken its duty of care towards  R  very  seriously  and  has
    ensured that there are a number of members of staff  who  are  able  to
    monitor  and  manage  her  condition,  including  weighing  her   food,
    measuring her blood glucose etc, administering insulin and if necessary
    taking the appropriate action to manage a hypo.

30. In respect of the medical evidence it is of course not in issue that  R
    does suffer from Type 1 diabetes. Nor is it disputed that the very many
    letters, appointment cards and reports from clinicians  in  the  bundle
    confirm that R is being regularly monitored and  treated.  I  therefore
    invited submissions simply on what the consequences would be for  R  if
    there were to be any interruption in care  or  deviation  from  in  her
    current treatment plan.

31. Ms Malhotra began by taking me to the 'discharge slip' issued by Burton
    Hospital NHS Foundation Trust in May 2015.    This  shows  that  R  was
    admitted to 'resus' on the 10th May acutely unwell: she was  pale,  had
    mottled skin and  was  having  difficulty  breathing.  Staff  initially
    suspected sepsis but within a day, made the diagnosis  of  diabetes.  A
    more detailed discharge summary sent by the hospital to R's GP  on  the
    13th  May  states  that  upon  admission   she   was   "semi-conscious,
    peripherally shut down and extremely dehydrated". Ms  Malhotra  invited
    me to find that absent the treatment  she  is  currently  receiving,  R
    would once again face admission  to  'resus'  for  these,  or  similar,
    conditions. This submission would appear to be supported by  a  further
    letter sent by Dr Jacob Samuel on  the  20th  January  2016.  Dr  Jacob
    explains that at that stage doctors were struggling to maintain  steady
    blood sugars for R. She was being tested at least five  times  per  day
    and being  given  two  different  forms  of  insulin,  Novo  Rapid  and
    Glargine. Dr Jacobs explains that because R is a child, her care  needs
    are complex. She needs to  be  monitored  closely  in  order  to  avoid
    complications such as kidney and eye problems. He writes:

         "Type 1 diabetes is a lifelong condition and unless  it  is  looked
         after  properly,  there  is  a  chance  that   she   will   develop
         complications at a very young age and will need regular input  from
         the specialist clinics and specialist nurse, which we are currently
         providing.

         If she does not receive regular medical support her condition  will
         deteriorate and cause serious risk to her health. Her  parents  are
         trying their best by working with us in this respect"

32. More baldly Paediatric Diabetes Specialist Nurse Jane Humphries, in her
    letter of the 20 May 2015, writes:

         "Type 1 diabetes is where the pancreas is unable to  make  insulin.
         Without insulin, we would die as  the  body  is  unable  to  change
         glucose (sugar)  into  the  energy  that  is  needed  to  live.  To
         compensate for the lack of natural insulin  injections  of  insulin
         are required.

         With the help of trained adults, we can manage diabetes in children
         at home and school. We need to  teach  people  how  to  test  blood
         glucose levels and what to do when the levels are out of acceptable
         limits. We also need to teach them how to  count  carbohydrates  in
         the food eaten so they can then calculate  the  amount  of  insulin
         that is required. We then need to teach how to inject  the  insulin
         dose that has been calculated"

33. Nurse Humphries has reiterated these points more recently in her letter
    of the 20th February 2018:

         "If not managed correctly diabetes is life threatening and can lead
         to an average of a 15-20 year shorter lifespan and a  multitude  of
         long term  microvascular  complications,  including  cardiovascular
         disease,   retinopathy,   nephropathy   and    neuropathy.    These
         complications can be seen in young people if diabetes  control  has
         not been optimum in their early years. To  maintain  good  diabetes
         control there is a need for regular access to  specialist  diabetes
         services. Type 1 sufferers are dependent on  insulin  injections  -
         without which they would die as they did pre-discovery  of  insulin
         in the 1920s. If diabetes is not managed correctly they risk having
         high blood glucose levels and ketones (which are the  end  products
         of  fat  metabolism).  This  is  turn  can  progress  to   diabetic
         ketoacidosis (DKA) which is the biggest cause  of  death  in  young
         people with diabetes...

         [R] is still a very young child  who  not  only  is  still  in  the
         'honeymoon  phase'  but  is  also  growing  and  secreting  various
         hormones that block the action of insulin - this in turn  leads  to
         fluctuating and inconsistent blood sugar levels"

34. I was finally referred to a 'checklist' given to  parents  of  children
    diagnosed with diabetes of what they need to take  home  and  remember.
    R's list states that she needs two types of insulin, the Novo Rapid and
    Glargine. The spare doses need to be  stored  in  the  fridge  and  the
    'pens' used to administer it need to be  stored  at  room  temperature.
    She requires two different types of blood test strips:  one  for  blood
    glucose to be used pre-meal and pre-bed, and one for blood  ketones  to
    be used if blood glucose shows a reading of over 14 mmols.   She  needs
    four different items in  order  to  treat  hypoglycaemia,  including  a
    glucogen injection kit which again must be stored in a fridge. She must
    in addition keep at home a box of spare insulin pen  needles  (a  fresh
    needle must be used in each injection), a sharps box, 2 insulin pens, 2
    meters, 2 medicine measures, daily food/glucose  sheets,  a  diary  and
    emergency contact numbers of the specialist team.

35. The evidence on Pakistan that was before the First-tier Tribunal is set
    out at paragraph 17 of Judge Garbett's decision:

         "(i)     I have an extract from the  World  Health  Organisation  -
         Diabetes Country Profiles, 2016-Pakistan (Appellants'  bundle  page
         29).  This  reports  that  in  Pakistan  in  terms  of   "policies,
         guidelines   and    monitoring"    there    is    no    operational
         policy/strategy/action plan for diabetes, to reduce overweight  and
         obesity  or  to  reduce  physical  inactivity;  no  evidence  based
         national diabetes guidelines/protocols/standards were available; no
         standard criteria for the referral of patients from primary care to
         higher level of care  were  available  and  there  is  no  diabetes
         registry or recent national  risk  factor  survey  in  which  blood
         glucose was measured. In terms of the availability of medicines  in
         the public health sector Metformin and Sulphonylurea are  generally
         available. However insulin is not generally available. In terms  of
         procedures, retinal photocoagulation, retinal  replacement  therapy
         by dialysis and retinal replacement therapy by transplantation  are
         not generally available. In terms of basic technologies in  primary
         care facilities blood glucose measurement, oral  glucose  tolerance
         test, HbA1c  test,  dilating  fundus  examination,  foot  vibration
         perception by tuning fork, foot  vascular  status  by  Doppler  and
         urine strips for glucose and ketones measurement are not  generally
         available.

         (ii)     I also have a blog entry published  on  2  September  2016
         "who is to  blame  for  negligence  towards  patients  at  military
         hospitals". This reports that there is  a  lack  of  treatment  and
         support for insulin-dependent diabetics in Pakistan.

         (iii)    I have an undated report from "Global Diabetes  Scorecard"
         in relation to Pakistan. This reports;

             "Pakistan is beginning  to  take  action  to  respond  to  the
             challenge of diabetes but progress  needs  to  be  made  on  a
             national plan and preventative policies, as well as monitoring
             and surveillance. The Member Association reports that diabetes
             and NCD services are insufficient due to budget restraints and
             inadequate distribution of funding.

             The low level of diabetes  -related  health  expenditures  has
             prevented a very small proportion (0.4%) of  diabetes  related
             deaths.  Increased   funding   for   cost-effective   diabetes
             prevention and treatment is needed."

         (iv)     I have "highlighted news with links" summarising  extracts
         from various press reports relevant to diabetes in Pakistan;

         (v)      I have a letter from the Punjab Education Foundation dated
         25 January 2016 which records;

             "It is stated that in Pakistan there are no medical facilities
             for the regular/emergency treatment  of  type  I  diabetes  in
             schools. It is further stated that  schools  in  Pakistan  are
             facing lack of training  regarding  type  I  diabetes  due  to
             insufficient provisions in this regard.  In  addition  parents
             often hesitate to share their child's medical condition due to
             the social stigma attached to  this  condition  and  leads  to
             bullying in schools and society as  a  whole.  This  situation
             leads both parents and child depressed/stressed asking for the
             need of mass awareness  campaigns  for  this  growing  medical
             condition."

36. I would add that item (iv) of Judge Garbett's summary is a  summary  of
    online news stories (with hyperlinks) which I believe has been collated
    by R's parents. The following points  are  to  be  gleaned  from  these
    articles:

      i) That there are "very few" private institutions  in  Pakistan  which
         can provide services  for  children  with  special  needs,  and  no
         provision at all in the public sector (The Nation, 8th June 2016);

     ii) Hot  weather  can  increase  the  risk  of  hypoglycemia  and  heat
         exhaustion for diabetics. Hypos may also be harder to spot  in  hot
         weather (www.diabetes.co.uk);

    iii) Pakistan's Interior Minister admits that between  45-50%  of  drugs
         sold in Pakistan are either fake or  of  substandard  quality.  The
         Pakistani  Pharmacist  Association  reports  that  there  are  4000
         licensed pharmacies, but over  100,000  illegal  merchants  selling
         medications purporting to be genuine (CNN, 30th August 2015);

     iv) Due to a lack of awareness and  training  by  adult  staff,  school
         pupils with diabetes can  be  denied  emergency  treatment;  social
         stigma remains a serious problem, with a strong belief  that  girls
         with Type 1 would be a financial burden on a family, and  would  be
         unable to conceive (Indian Journal of Endocrinology and Metabolism,
         Sept/Oct 2014)

37. Before me the Respondent relied  on  the  updated  Country  Policy  and
    Information Note Pakistan: Medical and Healthcare Issues, published  in
    August 2018. Under the heading 'diabetes' the CPIN reproduces a  report
    from the Gulf News in June 2017  stating  that  a  UAE-based  Pakistani
    doctor was undertaking an ambitious project to  build  the  first  ever
    diabetes hospital for underprivileged patients in Pakistan.  This  will
    be built in Islamabad and will create awareness as  well  as  providing
    treatment.   The foundation established  by  this  doctor  is  now  the
    biggest charity in Pakistan, and even before the facility is  built  it
    has managed to treat 45,000 people from  a  temporary  facility.    The
    MedCOI website is also cited as stating that certain  tests  for  blood
    sugar levels are available and  that  "insulin  and  insulin  injection
    devices were available" [3.1.2].  It was not clear from  this  document
    to what extent Type 1 diabetes may be treated, nor whether the type  of
    insulin referred to in the MedCOI report  were  the  types  of  insulin
    required by R.

    Discussion and Findings

38. I begin by recording, and accepting, a submission made by Mr Bramble in
    respect of the interplay between Articles 3 and 8  in  the  context  of
    health care cases. Mr Bramble quite properly pointed out that the tests
    are here "in close alignment": GS (India) v Secretary of State for  the
    Home Department [2015] EWCA Civ 40, AM (Zimbabwe) v Secretary of  State
    for the Home Department [2018] EWCA Civ 64.  If a medical  claim  fails
    under Article 3, it is unlikely to succeed under Article 8 unless there
    is some additional factual  element  to  bring  the  claim  within  the
    Article  8  paradigm,  such  as  the  capacity  to   form   and   enjoy
    relationships. This principle is,  observed  Laws  LJ  in  GS  (India),
    consistent with the Court's findings in MM (Zimbabwe)  v  Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department [2012] EWCA Civ 279.  The  fact  that  an
    individual receives life saving treatment in this country,  or  may  be
    unable to access it in the country to which he  will  be  removed,  are
    neither factors which  could  in  themselves  be  determinative  of  an
    Article 8 claim, although they may of course be factors relevant to the
    overall balancing exercise.

39. The starting point for consideration of Article 8 in any case  such  as
    this, where no member of the family enjoys settled status in the United
    Kingdom, is paragraph 276ADE(1):

         276ADE(1). The requirements to be met by an applicant for leave  to
         remain on the grounds of private life in the UK  are  that  at  the
         date of application, the applicant:

             (i) does not fall for refusal under  any  of  the  grounds  in
             Section S-LTR 1.1 to S-LTR 2.2. and S-LTR.3.1.  to  S-LTR.4.5.
             in Appendix FM; and

             (ii)      has made a valid application for leave to remain  on
             the grounds of private life in the UK; and

             (iii)     has lived continuously in the UK  for  at  least  20
             years (discounting any period of imprisonment); or

             (iv)       is  under  the  age  of  18  years  and  has  lived
             continuously in the UK for at least 7 years  (discounting  any
             period of imprisonment) and it  would  not  be  reasonable  to
             expect the applicant to leave the UK; or

             (v) is aged 18 years or above and under 25 years and has spent
             at least half of  his  life  living  continuously  in  the  UK
             (discounting any period of imprisonment); or

             (vi)      subject to sub-paragraph (2), is aged  18  years  or
             above, has lived continuously in the UK for less than 20 years
             (discounting any period of imprisonment) but  there  would  be
             very significant obstacles to the applicant's integration into
             the country to which he would have to go if required to  leave
             the UK.

40. It is accepted that R can place no reliance on  any  of  the  alternate
    paragraphs in that provision since none can apply to her: although  she
    is under the age of 18 she has not lived  continuously  in  the  United
    Kingdom for at least 7 years (she only arrived in 2014).   All  of  the
    other provisions can be applied only to adults.  The two adults in this
    case cannot rely on (iii), because they have not established such  long
    residence, nor by virtue of their respective ages, can either  of  them
    rely on (v). The only provision of  276ADE(1)  that  might  potentially
    apply to R's parents is (vi), which would require  them  to  show  that
    there  were  "very  significant  obstacles"  to  their  integration  in
    Pakistan. Before me Mr Bramble accepted, as a matter of principle, that
    difficulties faced by R could amount to difficulties - or  obstacles  -
    for her parents. I therefore assess the nature  of  such  obstacles  as
    they are faced by the family as a whole.

41. In Kamara v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2016] EWCA  Civ
    813 the Court of Appeal emphasised that the test of  "very  significant
    obstacles" derives from the jurisprudence on  private  life  claims  in
    removal cases. Whilst practical obstacles  such  as  accommodation  and
    finances may be relevant to  this  assessment,  the  focus  of  enquiry
    should be on the  ability  of  the  individual  concerned  to  enjoy  a
    meaningful private life in the country of return.  The  question  would
    therefore be whether he or she would be able:

         "... to operate on a day-to-day basis in that society and to  build
         up within a reasonable time a variety  of  human  relationships  to
         give substance to the individual's private or family life".

42. This guidance is consistent with how the Secretary of State  interprets
    the rule. In his policy guidance Appendix FM  1.0  Family  Life  (as  a
    Partner or Parent) and Private Life: 10-Year Routes January  2019,  the
    Respondent instructs caseworkers that the starting point should be  the
    presumption that integration will be possible. It is for the  applicant
    to introduce evidence to demonstrate  that  it  is  not.  A  number  of
    factors can be considered, for instance linguistic, familial,  cultural
    and social ties to the destination country, but the  focus  should,  in
    the Respondent's view, be on the extent to which it is possible for the
    applicant to enjoy an Article 8 private life if removed from the United
    Kingdom:

         'A very significant obstacle to integration means  something  which
         would prevent or seriously inhibit the applicant  from  integrating
         into the country of return. The decision maker is looking for  more
         than obstacles. They are looking to see  whether  there  are  "very
         significant" obstacles, which is a high threshold. Very significant
         obstacles will exist where the  applicant  demonstrates  that  they
         would be unable to establish a  private  life  in  the  country  of
         return, or where establishing a private  life  in  the  country  of
         return would entail very serious hardship for the applicant.'

                                                            (emphasis added)

43. The Court of Appeal judgment in Kamara, and the  Secretary  of  State's
    policy guidance, are both in turn consonant with the  jurisprudence  of
    the European Court of Human Rights, which has  consistently  held  that
    the term 'private life' encompasses "the physical and  moral  integrity
    of the person"[1]  and that this must include, fundamentally, the right
    to establish and develop relationships with other human beings: see for
    instance McFeeley v United Kingdom[2] and Pretty v  United  Kingdom[3].
    It is for that reason that  the  rule  will  also  inform  my  decision
    'outside of the  rules'.  As  both  parties  accepted,  the  only  real
    difference between  276ADE(1)(vi)  and  the  proportionality  balancing
    exercise in a freestanding Razgar assessment would be that  in  respect
    of the latter I would be bound to weigh in the balance the quality  and
    depth of the Appellants' individual private lives in  this  country,  a
    factor specifically excluded under the rule.

44. What then of the facts?

45. I note that both of the adult  Appellants  express  concern  that  they
    would face  financial  and  practical  difficulties  in  relocating  to
    Pakistan. Although both are highly educated (to Masters level) and have
    worked in Pakistan in the past, they point out that they have been  out
    of the job market there for  some  time  and  that  they  may  find  it
    difficult to find work upon their return.  I was shown no  evidence  to
    demonstrate that such fears are well-founded. Both of these adults  are
    familiar with Pakistani society. They are educated and  resourceful.  I
    note that their witness statements were silent about whether they  have
    family members in that country to whom they could turn for  support  if
    necessary. Mindful that the burden of proof lies on the  Appellants  in
    such matters I am not satisfied that there is a  real  risk  that  this
    family would face  significant  practical  difficulty  in  economically
    providing for themselves.

46. I am however very concerned about the ability of  R  to  safely  access
    education, and for the reasons I shall explain,  I  believe  that  this
    will have significant repercussions for the family as a whole.

47. It is abundantly clear that R is no  ordinary  pupil.  Her  school  has
    commendably played an important role  in  keeping  her  well,  and  has
    permitted up to six teachers to undertake specialist training in how to
    manage her condition. This does not simply mean that they keep  an  eye
    on her. It means a daily routine of  measuring  blood  glucose  levels,
    weighing food accordingly, and supervising her insulin injections. They
    are trained to spot, and deal with, her becoming unwell. This is labour
    intensive, and entirely necessary. Without this training and willing, I
    am quite satisfied that R would not be able to attend school at all.

48. I am further satisfied that there is  not  the  remotest  chance  of  R
    receiving that level of care, nor anything approaching it, in Pakistan.
    There is no evidence before me to indicate that schools, whether  state
    sector or private, would enable or permit their staff to undertake such
    a role.  The evidence uniformly  indicates  that  there  is  a  general
    ignorance about Type 1 diabetes, even in the medical profession. It  is
    therefore extremely unlikely that teachers  would  have  the  requisite
    skills. I have no reason to reject the evidence of  R's  aunt  to  that
    effect, particularly  since  it  is  supported  by  the  newspaper  and
    academic articles supplied by the Appellants.  Furthermore I cannot  be
    satisfied that teaching staff would be willing to  obtain  such  skills
    and deliver such care.

49. I am therefore satisfied that for R the immediate consequence of return
    to Pakistan would be that she  would  stop  going  to  school.  If  her
    parents want to keep her safe, the only option  realistically  open  to
    them would be to keep  her  at  home,  where  they  can  undertake  the
    monitoring and treatment tasks currently performed throughout  the  day
    by R's primary school teachers.

50.  In  her  submissions  Ms  Malhotra  emphasised  the  significance   of
    education, and that the interference with it would be contrary  to  R's
    best  interests,  but  in  fact  for  the  purpose  of  the  rule   the
    inaccessibility of schools raises a more fundamental problem.  That  is
    that R's world will immediately shrink. At present the evidence -  from
    Ms Tranter, Ms Church and Ms Coates - is to the  effect  that  R  is  a
    happy and outgoing child who has lots of friends  and  socialises  well
    with her peers.    Such  relationships  are  obviously  of  fundamental
    importance to a child, and play a vital role in  her  development.  The
    consequence of removal would be that all such  relationships,  and  the
    opportunity to play and learn from others, would be a  distant  memory.
    I find that this would be a significant interference with  R's  private
    life within the meaning contemplated in Kamara: it is very difficult to
    see how, confined to her parents' home, she would be able to "build  up
    within a reasonable time a  variety  of  human  relationships  to  give
    substance to [her] private or family life". Outwith the home R  is,  on
    the  evidence  before  me,  likely  to  encounter  not  only  medically
    dangerous  circumstances,  but  social  stigma,  suspicion   and   even
    hostility.  So whilst she may be able to access education (ie through a
    private tutor) and her parents may be able to find and pay for  private
    medical care (for which see below) the effect of return to Pakistan for
    R will be an effective nullification of Article 8  rights  with  anyone
    bar her immediate family.

51. I am satisfied that this self-confinement is also likely to  have  very
    serious consequences for R's parents. Presumably at least one  of  them
    will need to work in order to maintain the family, and if necessary pay
    for R's medical bills. That will mean that the other is left at home to
    care for R, in all probability her mother HK, her  world  shrinking  at
    the same rate as her daughter's.

52. It follows that I am satisfied that the test in  276ADE(1),  as  it  is
    truly understood, is met in these cases.  The immediate consequence  of
    return will be that for R, and at  least  one  of  her  parents,  their
    'private lives' will  be  limited  to  interaction  with  other  family
    members within the home, it simply being too dangerous to permit  R  to
    go, on a daily basis, about her life in the way that a  normal  9  year
    old would.  I would therefore allow the linked appeals  with  reference
    to paragraph 276ADE(1) and Article 8.

53. Given its importance in the case it is appropriate however that  I  say
    something about medical care. The situation facing Type 1 diabetics  in
    Pakistan is  obviously  very  difficult.   Insulin  is  "not  generally
    available". The various tests that R uses on a daily basis to keep  her
    safe - the "basic technologies" such as glucose testing kits, are  "not
    generally available". Treatment for diabetes-related ailments  such  as
    sight loss  are  "not  generally  available".  The  government  has  no
    national plan in place to address these issues.   I note that there  is
    now a charitable foundation operating a  hospital  in  Islamabad  which
    offers some hope, but it is unclear on the evidence before me  to  what
    extent it might  offer  the  right  care  for  R.    Aside  from  these
    significant obstacles I note  that  there  are  other  challenges  with
    relocating to Pakistan. The first is the change in  climate.  'Diabetes
    UK' report that exposure to hot weather can increase the risk of crisis
    for diabetics, and make life difficult for those caring  for  them,  as
    heat exhaustion and dehydration  can  mask  symptoms  of  more  serious
    conditions. More significantly I have  very  real  concerns  about  R's
    ability to access safe and genuine insulin.  The government of Pakistan
    themselves recognise that up to  50%  of  drugs  sold  in  'pharmacies'
    across the country are actually substandard and inefficacious,  if  not
    completely fake.   It  would  only  take  one  dose  of  such  fake  or
    substandard insulin to place R  in  very  significant  medical  danger.
    Having read the medical evidence  I  have  little  confidence  that  if
    admitted to hospital in such circumstances R  would  receive  the  care
    that she requires.

54. It is therefore the case that whilst  the  particular  insulin  that  R
    needs may be available in Pakistan (whether it is, is actually unclear)
    her parents would  in  effect  be  playing  with  roulette  with  their
    daughter's life every time they purchased medication for her.  Even  if
    they could find a  trusted  source,  they  would  be  living  with  the
    constant stress - or terror - that what they were injecting into  their
    daughter's stomach could in fact kill her. That is a level  of  anxiety
    that any parent would recognise as amounting to mental torture.   I  am
    quite  satisfied  that  it  would  meet   the   'high   threshold'   in
    276ADE(1)(vi) and render the removal of this family disproportionate.

55. For those reasons I find that the burden of proof in respect of Article
    8 has been discharged, and that  the  appeals  should  be  allowed.  It
    follows that I need not address Article 3.




    Anonymity

56. The Appellants' linked appeals turn  on  the  presence  in  the  United
    Kingdom of R. Having had regard to Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
    (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 and the Presidential Guidance Note No 1  of
    2013: Anonymity Orders I am concerned that identification of the  adult
    Appellants may lead to identification of R and I therefore consider  it
    appropriate to make an order in the following terms:

         "Unless and until  a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
         Appellants are granted anonymity.  No report of  these  proceedings
         shall directly or indirectly identify them or any member  of  their
         family.  This  direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  both  the
         Appellants  and  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with  this
         direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"




    Decisions and Directions

57. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside.

58. I remake the decision in the appeal as follows: "the appeal is  allowed
    on human rights grounds".

59. There is a direction for anonymity.
