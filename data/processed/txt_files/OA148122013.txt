Representation:

For the Appellant: Mr Marfat, Newcastle Legal Centre
For the Respondent: Mr C Dewison, Senior Home Office Presenting Office


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. The Appellant in this appeal is a citizen of Bangladesh, who was  born
      on the 1 February, 1988.  She made application for entry clearance  as
      a partner of Mr  Mohammed  Bodrull  Chowdhury  ("the  Sponsor")  under
      Appendix FM of Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules, HC  395,  as
      amended ("the immigration rules").

   2. The Respondent refused the application on the  13  June,  2013,  under
      Appendix ECP.1.1 of Appendix FM, on the basis that the  Appellant  and
      her Sponsor had failed to demonstrate  they  had  genuinely  formed  a
      relationship and  that  they  had  failed  to  demonstrate  that  they
      intended to live permanently together as  their  spouses.   The  Entry
      Clearance  Officer  was  also  not  satisfied  that  the  Sponsor  had
      demonstrated that he meets the financial requirements  of  the  rules,
      which show a gross income of at least �18,600 per annum.

   3. The judge recorded at paragraph 4 of her determination that the  Entry
      Clearance Officer was not  satisfied  that  there  would  be  adequate
      accommodation for the appellant  and  sponsor.   The  Entry  Clearance
      Officer subsequently reviewed the decision on the  18  February,  2014
      and conceded that the relationship between the couple was  subsisting.
      At paragraph  27  of  the  determination  the  judge  found  that  the
      accommodation was  adequate  and  decided  that  the  issue  for  her,
      therefore,  was  whether   the   Sponsor   satisfied   the   financial
      requirements to show an income of at least �18,600 per annum.

   4. The sponsor gave oral evidence at the hearing and  explained  that  he
      had a second job which he had started some seven months prior  to  the
      hearing.  The judge recorded his salaried income from East India Take-
      away as being �12,875 per annum.  She noted  a  P.60  which  had  been
      adduced in evidence, stated that the Sponsor had  earned,  during  the
      tax year  commencing  April  2012,  ending  April  2013,  the  sum  of
      �2,971.20 from his second employment with Elachi Crook, as  at  the  5
      April 2013.  She  concluded  that  the  Sponsor  did  not  fulfil  the
      financial requirements set out in the Immigration Rules and  dismissed
      the Appellant's appeal.

   5. In dismissing the Appellant's appeal, the judge failed  to  take  into
      account the second income which had been pursued by  the  Sponsor  for
      five months before the date of  the  application,  because  the  judge
      found it had only been pursued for some five months and  she  believed
      that under the  requirements  of  the  rules,  it  had  to  have  been
      established for six months.   The  Appellant  challenged  the  judge's
      decision and First-tier Tribunal Judge Gillespie granted permission to
      appeal.

   6. At the hearing before me Mr Dewison accepted that there  was  a  clear
      error of law in the judge's determination, in  that  she  should  have
      taken into account the second income even though  it  was  not  for  a
      period of six months or more.  However, he suggested  that  the  error
      was not material.

   7. For the Appellant, Mr Marfat suggested that the decision was wrong  in
      law because the judge failed to consider the second income.  He agreed
      with me that the Sponsor's salaried income  up  to  the  date  of  the
      decision of the Entry Clearance Officer totalled  �13,008  per  annum,
      earned from the East India Take-away in accordance with  the  evidence
      provided by HM Customs and Revenue, together with the sum of �595  per
      month which the Sponsor had been earning for five months. He suggested
      that the rules required that the second income had to be calculated on
      the basis of twelve months, because it was looking forward.

   8. I explained that it was a requirement of the rule  that  the  earnings
      had to be the actual earnings  of  the  Sponsor  during  the  previous
      twelve months immediately prior to the application.  He accepted   and
      agreed with me that the total  earnings  of  the  Sponsor  during  the
      previous twelve month period immediately preceding  the  date  of  the
      Entry Clearance Officer's decision, was a little  under  �16,000.   In
      actual fact the figure is �15,979, so that the Sponsor could not  meet
      the financial requirements of Appendix FM of the rules.

   9. However, submitted Mr Marfat, at the  time  of  the  judge's  decision
      there was in existence a decision of the Upper  Tribunal  decision  of
      the Administrative Court  decided  by  the  Former  President  of  the
      Tribunal, Mr Justice Blake in MM, R (On  the  Application  Of)  v  The
      Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2013]  EWHC  1900,  which
      suggested if certain factors were met, and I am  not  sure  that  they
      were in this case in any event, the requirements of the rules breached
      Article 8 of the European Convention of Protection of Human Rights and
      Fundamental Freedoms.  He said that had the judge properly  calculated
      the figures as at the date of  her  hearing  as  being  �15,979,  then
      taking into account the Administrative  Court's  decision  in  MM  she
      should have allowed the appeal.

  10. Mr  Marfat  accepted  that  the  Court  of  Appeal  decided  that  the
      Administrative Court's  decision  in  MM  was  wrong  law.   What  the
      Administrative Court said in MM, never has been the law.  While  Judge
      Bircher might very well have been bound by the  decision,  because  at
      that time it had not been overturned  by  the  Court  of  Appeal,  her
      decision would have been wrong in law  and  it  would  no  doubt  have
      prompted the Secretary of State to have appealed the decision.

  11. I have concluded therefore that was an error in the determination  and
      it was an error of law, but it was not one that  could  possibly  have
      affected the outcome of the appeal, because  even  if  the  judge  had
      properly taken into account the full extent of the  second  income  of
      the Sponsor, the appellant would still  not  have  met  the  financial
      requirements of the  rules.   For  all  these  reasons  I  uphold  her
      decision.
