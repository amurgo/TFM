For the Appellant:     Mr Osifeso (Legal Representative)
For the Respondent:    Mr Deller (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

         1. The Appellant, citizen of Guinea, was born on July 16, 1991. She
            entered the United Kingdom on May 24, 2012 and on  December  27,
            2012 she applied for a residence card as the spouse  of  an  EEA
            national. This application was refused under Regulation 6 of the
            Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 on October
            9, 2013 on the basis there  was  limited  evidence  showing  the
            sponsor was exercising treaty rights.

         2. On October 21, 2013 the Appellant  appealed  to  the  First-tier
            Tribunal under Section 82(1) Nationality, Immigration and Asylum
            Act 2002 (hereinafter called the  2002  Act),  as  amended,  and
            Regulation 26 of the 2006  Regulations.  On  April  14,  2014  a
            notice was sent to  the  parties  indicating  that  any  written
            evidence and submissions must be received by the Tribunal by May
            5, 2014.

         3.  On  May  6,  2014  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal   Cohen
            (hereinafter called "the FtTJ") dealt with this  appeal  on  the
            papers. He noted that despite the concerns raised in the refusal
            letter no further evidence had been submitted. He dismissed  the
            appeal in a decision promulgated on May 19, 2014.

         4. The Appellant lodged grounds of appeal  on  May  22,  2014.  She
            submitted that additional evidence had been sent to Taylor House
            on May 2, 2014 and had been received by the Tribunal on  May  6,
            2014.  She said there had been a procedural unfairness  and  the
            decision should be set aside. Permission to appeal  was  granted
            by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Nicholson on June  25,  2014
            because he  found  it  arguable  there  had  been  a  procedural
            unfairness for the reason given in the grounds.

         5. The matter came before me on the date set out above. Neither the
            appellant nor sponsor was in attendance.

         6. The file contained a certificate of posting and this confirmed a
            letter/parcel had been sent to the Tribunal on May 2, 2014. This
            was the Friday before the  May  Bank  Holiday.  This  meant  any
            papers sent could not be delivered (they had to be  signed  for)
            until May 6, 2014 because the Tribunal was shut on May 3 and  5,
            2014.

         7. Mr Deller accepted that Rule 57(2) of the Asylum and Immigration
            Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005 provides-

        "... Where the time specified by these Rules or by a  direction  of
        the Tribunal for doing an act ends on a day which is not a business
        day that act is done in time if it is done  on  the  next  business
        day."

         8. Mr Deller accepted it was arguable the notice sent  out  to  the
            parties on April 14, 2014 was a direction and  consequently  the
            papers that  had been sent on May 2, 2014 were received in time.



         9. The papers had clearly not come to the FtTJ's  attention  as  he
            made it clear in his determination at  paragraph  [10]  that  no
            additional paperwork was before him other than the papers lodged
            with the application and appeal notice.

        10. Mr Deller also accepted that  in  paragraph  [9]  the  FtTJ  had
            incorrectly stated the relevant date for him  was  the  date  of
            decision whereas it should have been the  date  of  hearing.  He
            also  wrongly  made  a  finding  under  paragraph  321A  of  the
            Immigration Rules.

        11. In short, Mr Deller  accepted  there  had  been  errors  in  the
            determination  and  on  the  basis   there   was   an   apparent
            irregularity he did not contest the error of law application.

        12. Having established there was an error in law on the  grounds  of
            procedural unfairness I asked the representatives  whether  they
            had any strong views on where the case should next be  heard.  I
            had in mind at this point Part 3, Section  7.1  to  7.3  of  the
            Practice Statement. They agreed this case should be remitted  to
            the First-tier Tribunal.

        13. Part 3, Section 7.1 to 7.3 of the Practice Statement states:

      "Where under section 12(1) of the Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement
      Act 2007 (proceedings on appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal)  the  Upper
      Tribunal finds that the making of the decision concerned involved  the
      making of an error on a point of law, the Upper Tribunal may set aside
      the decision and, if it does so, must either remit  the  case  to  the
      First-tier  Tribunal  under  section  12(2)(b)(i)   or   proceed   (in
      accordance with relevant Practice Directions) to re-make the  decision
      under section 12(2)(b)(ii).


      The Upper Tribunal is likely on each such occasion to proceed  to  re-
      make the decision, instead of remitting the  case  to  the  First-tier
      Tribunal, unless the Upper Tribunal is satisfied that:ï¿½


      a) the effect of the error has been to  deprive  a  party  before  the
         First-tier Tribunal of a fair hearing or other opportunity for that
         party's case  to  be  put  to  and  considered  by  the  First-tier
         Tribunal; or


      b) the nature  or  extent  of  any  judicial  fact  finding  which  is
         necessary in order for the decision in the appeal to be re-made  is
         such that, having regard to the overriding objective in rule 2,  it
         is appropriate to remit the case to the First-tier Tribunal.

         Remaking rather than remitting  will  nevertheless  constitute  the
         normal approach to determining appeals where an  error  of  law  is
         found, even if some further fact finding is necessary."


        14. In light of the reason for the error in law I was satisfied this
            was a case that should be returned to the First-tier Tribunal.

        15. I made the following directions:

 i. The case will be listed for a one and half hour oral hearing at  Taylor
    House on March 11, 2015.


ii. The appellant's  representatives  must  file  and  serve  on  both  the
    Tribunal and respondent a complete bundle of evidence to be relied  on.
    This should include witness statements  from  both  the  appellant  and
    sponsor. The evidence should address the concerns raised in the refusal
    letter.

iii. The appellant's bundle of documents must be filed  no  later  than  4pm
    February 15, 2015.

Decision

        16. The making of  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did
            involve the making of an error on a point of  law.  I  have  set
            aside the decision.

        17. The appeal is remitted back to the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  a
            fresh appeal hearing under Section 12 of the  Tribunals,  Courts
            and Enforcement Act 2007.
