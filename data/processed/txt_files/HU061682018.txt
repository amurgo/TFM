               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr M Biggs instructions by Vision Solicitors Ltd
For the Respondent:    Mr S Walker, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant appeals, with permission, against the decision of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Fenoughty promulgated on  25th  November  2020  and
    dismissing the appellant's appeal  against  the  Secretary  of  State's
    decision of 5th February 2018 to refuse his application for  indefinite
    leave to  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  under  paragraph  276B  and
    paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules.

 2. The appellant entered the UK as a student in September  2006  and  made
    successful applications for Tier 1 status in 2008, 2011 and 2013.   The
    2011 and 2013 applications were based on annual income  which  exceeded
    �35,000 in those years.

 3. The appellant married his wife, a Dutch national, on 28th  March  2011,
    they had a daughter on 6th March 2013 and separated  approximately  six
    months later when the wife returned to live in the  Netherlands  and  a
    court order was made on 9th December 2015 providing for contact between
    the appellant and his daughter.

 4. In 2016 the appellant declared to the HMRC that errors had been made by
    his accountants who had mistakenly overwritten the income declared used
    for the applications for the tax years ending April 2011 and 2013.  The
    applicant paid the tax due of �9,147.97 and �9,123.19 respectively.  On
    2nd September 2016 he made  an  application  for  indefinite  leave  to
    remain under paragraph 276B of the Immigration Rules.

 5. That application was refused, and his appeal was heard on 15th November
    2018 and the decision was set aside  and  the  matter  reheard  on  7th
    January 2019.  That second decision was set aside by the  Tribunal  and
    the matter was again remitted for rehearing.

 6. The refusal letter of the respondent dated 5th February  2018  recorded
    that the appellant  had  made  an  application  in  February  2016  and
    following a pause in considerations had been sent a  tax  questionnaire
    by UK Visas  and  Immigration  ("UKVI")  with  a  request  for  further
    evidence, which he returned on 28th August  2017.  The  refusal  letter
    rejected the appellant's explanation that the registered accountant had
    submitted a self-assessment tax return declaring earnings  considerably
    lower than their  client's  actual  earnings.   It  was  concluded  the
    appellant had misrepresented his earnings at  various  times  and  from
    time to time and changed what he had  represented  in  respect  of  his
    earnings to HMRC and/or UKVI  for  the  purpose  of  reducing  his  tax
    liability or for the purpose of obtaining leave to remain or both.   As
    he had a Masters of Business Administration degree  it  was  considered
    not  credible  that  he  would  have  not  noticed   the   considerable
    discrepancy between the sums declared to HMRC.

 7. It was noted that paragraph 322(5) was not mandatory, but  it  was  not
    accepted that the appellant had satisfactorily  demonstrated  that  his
    failure to declare to HMRC his earnings 'were genuine errors'.

 8. Also under paragraph 276B(ii)(c) it was undesirable for him to be given
    leave to remain taking into account his character and conduct.

 9. It was noted in respect of his private and family life that  his  child
    was not a British citizen and was not living in  the  UK  and  had  not
    lived in the UK for seven years prior to the application.   There  were
    no exceptional circumstances.

Grounds for Permission to Appeal

10. The application for permission to  appeal  noted  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal found the respondent was:

         "Entitled to infer that he  had  been  deceitful  or  dishonest  in
         relation to the income declared to the HMRC  and/or  UKVI  for  the
         years ending April 2011 and 2013.  It  was  a  rational  conclusion
         that he had not been completely honest or transparent  in  relation
         to his income, either with the Home Office or with HMRC" (paragraph
         94).

    The appeal was dismissed essentially for this reason.

11. The judge also found that the appellant's child's best  interests  were
    for her father, the appellant, to remain in the UK  to  ensure  regular
    face to face contact  but  this  did  not  constitute  a  "particularly
    strong" Article 8 ECHR claim making the respondent's discretionary  use
    of paragraph 322(5) and 276B(ii) and (iii) was not disproportionate  in
    the circumstances.

12. It was submitted that the grounds of appeal were as follows.

    Ground 1

    The judge materially erred in law by failing to make necessary findings
    of fact.  In particular, the judge failed to decide for herself whether
    the appellant was dishonest and if  so  whether  he  was  dishonest  in
    respect of his dealings with the HMRC, the respondent or both.

13. As the House of Lords explained in  Huang  [2007]  UKHL  11  the  FtT's
    function:

         "Is not a secondary, reviewing, function dependent on  establishing
         that the  primary  decision  maker  misdirected  himself  or  acted
         irrationally  or  was  guilty  of  procedural   impropriety.    The
         appellate immigration authority must decide for itself whether  the
         impugned decision is lawful and, if not, but only if  not,  reverse
         it".

14. It was accepted the judge made several findings but she  did  not  make
    any findings as to whether (a) the appellant acted dishonestly, and (b)
    whether he acted dishonestly in respect of HMRC or  the  respondent  or
    both.  Instead, the judge merely found it was  a  "rational  conclusion
    that he [the appellant] had not been completely honest  or  transparent
    in relation to his income with the Home Office or with HMRC".

15. It was apparent the judge did not make the required findings identified
    by this ground of appeal.  At paragraph 103 the judge  states  "I  have
    found the respondent was entitled to find that he  had  been  dishonest
    and that paragraph 322(5) was engaged".

16. The judge also wrote at paragraph  111  "he  has  been  found  to  have
    misrepresented  his  income  either  to  HMRC  or  to  UKVI  and  as  a
    consequence, he does not meet the provisions of the rules...".

17. When read in context and  in the light of paragraph 94 and 103 and  the
    absence of any findings by this judge as to dishonesty and  as  to  the
    precise particulars of the dishonesty and that noting the reference  in
    paragraph 111 to "he  has been found" must be to the  findings  of  the
    respondent, not those of the FtT, there are simply no findings  by  the
    judge on these matters.

18. It was submitted that was an error of law and material.

19. The grounds further read:

         "It cannot be assumed that the judge would have found the appellant
         behaved dishonestly and certainly no assumptions can be made  about
         what the findings the FtTJ would have made as  to  the  extent  and
         details of any dishonesty (for e.g.  where  there  was  dishonestly
         (sic) in respect of HMRC, or in  respect  of  applications  to  the
         respondent, or both)".

    This was clear because the judge made several findings at paragraph  93
    that were in fact consistent with the appellant's case.

20. She found in respect of both relevant tax years the appellant submitted
    the correct figures to HMRC only  for  these  to  then  be  overwritten
    later.  Whilst this was admittedly  odd  it  was  consistent  with  the
    appellant's attempt to explain the discrepancies by  surmising  that  a
    second firm of accountants submitted incorrect data to  HMRC.   It  was
    extremely hard to understand why the  appellant  would  have  submitted
    correct data to HMRC only to amend this later if his intention  was  to
    commit tax fraud.  The judge does  not  evaluate  the  implications  of
    these  points  because  she  does  not  consider  herself  whether  the
    appellant was dishonest.

21. Further, even if the judge found the appellant  acted  dishonestly  the
    judge made no attempt to determine whether the appellant lied  to  HMRC
    or to the respondent or whether he lied to both organisations or as  to
    whether he was dishonest in some other way.

22. As the Upper Tribunal observed in Ashfaq (Balajigari:  appeals)  [2020]
    UKUT 226 it is necessary to consider which of the various possibilities
    are correct.

    Ground 2

23. The judge materially erred  by  failing  to  consider  and  decide  for
    herself whether the appellant's presence in the UK with his being given
    ILR was undesirable.  Without prejudice to the generality of the  point
    the judge erred by treating the evaluation of whether the appellant was
    undesirable as part of the evaluation of whether paragraph  322(5)  and
    276B(ii) should have been deployed as  a  matter  of  the  respondent's
    discretion.

24. As held in Balajigari v SSHD [2019] EWCA Civ 673,  the  application  of
    paragraph 322(5) required a two-stage analysis, see  paragraph  33,  37
    and 38.  In effect, there was a two-stage analysis, the first stage  to
    decide whether paragraph 322(5) applied at all - that it is undesirable
    to grant leave in the light of the specified matters, and  if  it  does
    since such undesirability is a  presumptive  rather  than  a  mandatory
    ground of refusal, to decide as a matter of  discretion  whether  leave
    should be refused on the basis of it.  As to undesirability there  must
    be (1) reliable evidence of, (2)  sufficiently  reprehensible  conduct,
    and  (3)  an  assessment  taking  proper  account   of   all   relevant
    circumstances.

25. The second stage:

         "The  Secretary  of  State  must   separately   consider   whether,
         notwithstanding the conclusion that  it  was  undesirable  for  the
         applicant to have leave to remain, there were  factors  outweighing
         the presumption that leave should for that reason be  refused.   He
         submitted that it is at this stage that the Secretary of State must
         consider such factors as the welfare of any minor children who  may
         be affected adversely by the decision and any human  rights  issues
         which arise.  That seems to us in principle correct" (paragraph  39
         of Balajigari).

26. The grounds submitted that a similar analysis  applied  in  respect  of
    276B(ii) which accordingly requires  the  decision  maker  to  evaluate
    whether it would be undesirable to grant a person ILR bearing  in  mind
    all relevant factors.

27. The judge must decide for herself the relevant facts and issues and the
    judge was required  to  decide  for  herself  whether  the  appellant's
    presence in the UK was "undesirable" and to do so after conducting  the
    balancing evaluation referred to above.  The judge plainly failed to do
    this and conflated the requirement to evaluate undesirability with  the
    second stage question as to whether it was proportionate  in  terms  of
    Article 8.  This was clear from paragraphs 103 to 104.

28. At  paragraph  103  the  judge  reiterated  that  "she  has  found  the
    respondent was entitled to find that he had been  dishonest,  and  that
    paragraph 322(5) was engaged".

29. At paragraph 104 she states "the decision not to grant leave, following
    paragraph  322(5)  is  discretionary.   I  do  not  accept  Mr   Biggs'
    submission that discretion should not have  been  exercised  to  refuse
    leave in the circumstances".

30.  It  was  tolerably  clear  therefore  that  the  judge  conflated  the
    evaluation of undesirability with the discretion as to whether  to  use
    paragraph 322(5).  That was a fundamental error.

31. A key submission to why it would not be undesirable for  the  appellant
    to remain in the UK was the fact the appellant's child's best interests
    lay in the appellant remaining in the UK.

32. The judge simply failed to consider the  submission  adequately  or  at
    all.

    Ground 3

33. The judge materially erred in making a perverse finding, i.e. a finding
    unsupported by evidence by relying on an assumption that the  appellant
    would be able to make periodic  visits  to  see  his  daughter  in  the
    Netherlands if he were to reside in Pakistan.

34. The appellant's evidence was that he would face  real  difficulties  in
    obtaining leave to enter  the  Netherlands  primarily  because  he  had
    limited ties to Pakistan and he would have  been  found  to  have  been
    undesirable in the UK.

35. The judge does not explain how in the light of them the appellant could
    periodically visit the Netherlands.

    Ground 4

36. The  judge  materially  erred  by  acting  procedurally  unfairly  when
    assessing  the  appellant's  credibility.   The   judge   relied   upon
    inconsistencies between the appellant's oral evidence and  his  witness
    statement of 2nd January 2020 but these were not put to  the  appellant
    during the hearing.  That was  procedurally  unfair  as  per  the  well
    settled principles of R v Secretary of State for the Home Department ex
    parte Doody [1994] 1 AC 531.  In judicial  procedure  it  is  axiomatic
    that  a  witness  should  be  given  the  opportunity  to  comment   on
    inconsistencies.

37. In submissions, at the hearing before me, Mr  Biggs  acknowledged  that
    the grant of permission effectively gave no reasons but submitted  that
    the judge after a lengthy process and setting out  of  her  conclusions
    for whatever reason did not make any findings on dishonesty and nor did
    she explain how the appellant was dishonest either in respect  of  HMRC
    or the Home Office or both and was required  to  do  so  for  which  he
    relied on Ashfaq.  He agreed that it was open to the Tribunal  to  find
    that the appellant was dishonest in respect of  both  but  the  primary
    point was that the judge made no  finding  of  dishonesty  at  all  but
    referred to whether the Home Office was entitled to do so  contrary  to
    Huang.  This statement was not an isolated slip as the remainder of the
    decision showed.  In relation to ground 2 Mr Biggs accepted that it was
    for the Secretary of State to exercise discretion and the  Tribunal  at
    the second stage must consider whether it was compatible with Article 8
    but the judge conflated the first and  the  second  stage.   The  judge
    failed to make a finding on undesirability. The  first  stage  required
    (1) reliable evidence of, (2) sufficiently reprehensible  conduct,  and
    (3) an assessment, taking proper account of all relevant  circumstances
    known about the applicant at  the  date  of  decision  on  whether  his
    presence in the UK is undesirable.  The second stage was  consideration
    of the factors outweighing the presumption that leave for  that  reason
    should be refused.  The judge conflated the third  limb  of  the  first
    stage with the second stage.

38. Mr Biggs acknowledged that the second ground linked to the first ground
    as to whether dishonesty was found.

39. In relation to  ground  3  Mr  Biggs  submitted  that  the  finding  at
    paragraph 101 that the appellant would be able to have periodic  visits
    to the Netherlands was unsupported  at  paragraph  32  and  33  by  the
    evidence.

40. In relation to ground 4 there  was  procedural  unfairness.   Mr  Biggs
    conceded that the grounds of  appeal  did  not  challenge  the  judge's
    finding on discrepancies but stated that the  discrepancy  between  the
    January 2020 statement and the oral statement should have been  put  to
    the appellant.  When I raised the availability of re-examination at the
    hearing before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to  address  that  Mr  Biggs
    acknowledged that he did not  have  in  his  bundle  the  statement  of
    January 2020.  It transpired that the appellant had instructed  further
    solicitors (this was the third time this  matter  had  been  considered
    before the First-tier Tribunal) and it would appear that  this  January
    2020 statement was not in the bundle.  Mr Biggs acknowledged  Doody  as
    pleaded in the grounds for  permission  to  appeal  and  accepted  that
    generally speaking an advocate was required to be aware of the contents
    of what was in the papers and deal with  that  at  examination-in-chief
    but that general obligation was not fatal  because  the  statement  the
    judge relied upon was not in the appellant's bundle as  the  solicitors
    had not included that within the papers.  Thus  he  did  not  have  the
    opportunity to allow the appellant to address the inconsistency, albeit
    the appellant may have been aware of an earlier statement.

41. I raised the case of Hassan Gheisari v Secretary of State for the  Home
    Department  [2004]  EWCA  Civ  1854  with  Mr  Biggs,  particularly  at
    paragraphs 11 to 14.  Mr Biggs responded that this was a very different
    assertion from a finding  of  fact  and  the  judge  should  have  made
    specific findings on dishonesty.

42. Mr Walker relied on the refusal of the grant  of  permission  of  Judge
    Loke.  In relation to  ground  1  that  merely  states  the  judge  was
    required to make a finding of dishonesty.  It was  not  incumbent  upon
    the judge to go further and determine whether the  appellant  had  been
    dishonest with HMRC or SSHD.  In any event paragraph 93 made plain that
    the judge found the appellant had been dishonest with HMRC.

43. In relation to ground 2, paragraph 322(5) states leave should  normally
    be refused where it would be undesirable for a person to remain in  the
    UK in the light of their conduct.  It is clear that the judge's  secure
    findings of dishonesty  on  the  part  of  the  appellant  amounted  to
    undesirable conduct.  The judge at 104 went on to  consider  whether  a
    discretion ought to have been exercised with reference to the  relevant
    authority.

44. Ground 3, at 101 the judge conceded it  may  well  be  easier  for  the
    appellant to visit his daughter from the UK but properly  concluded  it
    was possible for the appellant to maintain communication  by  Skype  or
    periodic visits.  That was a finding which was open to the judge  given
    there was no independent evidence to indicate the  appellant  would  be
    unable to visit his daughter from Pakistan.

45. Ground 4, the judge was plainly entitled to assess the entirety of  the
    evidence  and  the  inconsistencies  therein  when  making  credibility
    findings.   It  was  not  incumbent  upon  the  judge  to   put   every
    inconsistency to the appellant in order to reach his findings.

46. Mr Biggs' submitted, by way of response, that paragraph 93  belied  the
    assertion that the judge made a clear finding.   Paragraph  93  of  the
    determination set out a series of clearly express and specific findings
    of fact but not a finding on dishonesty.

47. It appeared that the judge failed to make a finding on  dishonesty  and
    evaluated the use of paragraph 322(5) by asking whether it was open  to
    the respondent to rely on the Rule in the circumstances  and  that  was
    plainly wrong in law.

48. If the judge was required to determine the  specificity  how  a  person
    accused of being undesirable in respect  of  paragraph  322(5)  of  the
    Immigration Rules had been dishonest, the  nature  and  extent  of  the
    applicant's  dishonesty  would  inevitably  be  relevant  to  (a)   the
    balancing of factors required by paragraph 322(5)  in  respect  of  the
    evaluation of undesirability, and (b) to  the  proportionality  of  the
    appellant's removal in respect of Article 8 more generally.

49. In respect of ground 2 Judge Loke's reasoning did not explain  why  the
    appellant's arguments were wrong and the judge made no finding that the
    appellant's presence in the UK was undesirable.

50. Mr Biggs submitted that the matter should be set aside in its  entirety
    and none of the findings preserved.  There should be a fresh evaluation
    of the facts because of the error  of  the  procedure  in  the  judge's
    approach which had meant the hearing was not fair.

Analysis

51. The primary ground of appeal was that the judge had failed to make  any
    findings on dishonesty.  The specific factual findings  the  judge  did
    make,  however,  which  ranged  from  paragraph  65  to  114  were  not
    challenged and Mr Biggs conceded that point.

52. From paragraph 65 the judge  made  a  series  of  crucial  findings  in
    relation to the appellant's explanation as to the  overwriting  of  the
    business accounts and the judge  further,  made  a  series  of  adverse
    credibility findings.  The judge had recorded that the appellant had  a
    Masters of Business Administration degree and that the  respondent  had
    stated it  was  not  credible  that  he  would  not  have  noticed  the
    considerable discrepancy between the sums declared to HMRC and  on  his
    Tier 1 (General) application and the tax implications this  would  have
    (9).  The question of dishonesty was central to the appeal and that  is
    evident from reading paragraphs 1 to 64 of the determination.

53. At paragraph 65 the judge found:

         "There are several aspects to the  appellant's  account  which  are
         inconsistent or contradictory, for which he has failed to  give  an
         adequate   explanation.    These   inconsistencies    significantly
         undermine the credibility of his explanation  for  the  discrepancy
         between the figures declared to the UKVI, and the  revised  figures
         declared to HMRC by the appellant's original accountants, Mahmood".

54. That clearly makes a finding on the appellant's credibility.

55. From paragraph 66 onwards, the  judge  addressed  the  two  streams  of
    income which was the appellant's explanation for the  "overwriting"  in
    the two years of accounts ending 2011 and 2013.  At  paragraph  67  the
    judge found that the appellant's assertion  in  his  written  statement
    (November 2020), that he knew the reason why Mahmood Accountants  filed
    a second stream of income - in order to avoid a late filing  penalty  -
    contradicted  his  oral  evidence  that  he  did  not  instruct   these
    accountants at all in relation to tax returns for year ended  2011  and
    2013 (at paragraph 67).  The judge also noted that,  inter  alia,  then
    the appellant  claimed  that  he  only  ever  instructed  one  firm  of
    accountants at a time and Mahmood took  action  without  his  knowledge
    (paragraph 69).  At paragraph 70 further implausibility became apparent
    when the appellant stated that he had  "dis-instructed  them  (Mahmood)
    part-way  through  the  year,  so  they  must   have   had   incomplete
    information, which they submitted to HMRC".  The judge pointed out  the
    contradiction and inconsistency at paragraph 71 that there was included
    in the evidence invoices from Mahmood for the tax years ending in  2011
    and 2013.

56. Again at paragraph 72 the judge noted that the "appellant said  he  had
    not instructed Mahmood to [do] enter the  lower  figures  and  had  not
    instructed them to file tax returns for him for these two years".

57. At paragraph 74 the judge  found  that  the  appellant  stated  in  his
    witness statement of November 2020  that  problems  with  HMRC  figures
    arose and were pointed out to him during  court  proceedings  over  his
    child and his "wife wished to obtain  further  child  maintenance.   He
    said she obtained his financial documents, including their  joint  bank
    statements and gave them to a friend who was an accountant without  his
    knowledge" and at the hearing she represented herself.  The judge found
    in fact that the proceedings related to  child  residence  and  contact
    only, not to  finance  and  further  the  wife  was  represented  by  a
    solicitor.  The judge also noted that the "court order  in  respect  of
    the appellant's daughter provided for her to spend time with him in the
    UK at Christmas and in the summer, and, in the Netherlands on alternate
    weekends".  Clearly the court  saw  fit  to  make  an  order  that  the
    appellant should have contact in the Netherlands and could travel to do
    so.

58. At paragraph 77 the judge recorded that the appellant:

         "Told the Tribunal that he did not know, until December  2015  that
         Mahmood had gone out  of  business  in  June  2015.   In  his  UKVI
         questionnaire dated 28th August 2017, he said Mahmood had submitted
         his tax returns for the years ending April  2015  and  April  2016.
         This could not have been true, if Mahmood had gone out of  business
         in June 2015".

59. Critically at paragraph 78 the judge found:

         "The appellant says he has not obtained  supporting  evidence  from
         his accountants because they went out of business in June 2015  and
         May 2017 respectively.  This does not explain why he did not obtain
         an explanation from JSR, before May 2017, for the  situation  which
         arose, when he became aware of it in December 2015".

    The judge concluded that  "the  absence  of  this  evidence  [from  JSR
    Accountants] undermines the appellant's credibility".

60. At paragraph 80 the judge found:

         "The appellant's explanation for the substitution of lower  figures
         to the HMRC for the tax return for  2012/2013  is  essentially  the
         same as his explanation for the substitution of the  lower  figures
         two years before.  I therefore find that his explanation is equally
         lacking in credibility".

    As the judge  also  found,  there  was  no  statement  from  Apex  (the
    appellant's  later  accountants)  and  no  accountant  from  that  firm
    attended to give evidence to explain how they "discovered that  Mahmood
    had overwritten earlier data, or how they had come to  the  conclusions
    in their letter of 21st December 2015".  In their letter they  referred
    to the second tax return filed by Mahmood in January 2012 but  no  copy
    of the "second tax return filed by Mahmood Accountancy".

61. The judge added at paragraph 82 that "there was no explanation for  the
    absence of a witness statement as to the circumstances  in  which  Apex
    were instructed, and the reasons for their conclusions".

62. Finally at paragraph 85 the judge concluded:

         "It is unclear  from  the  evidence  exactly  how  the  substituted
         figures came to be submitted to HMRC.  However  the  appellant  has
         been given every opportunity to explain the situation, and  I  have
         found  his   explanations   to   be   implausible,   contradictory,
         inconsistent  and  insufficient  to  support  his  claim  that  the
         discrepancies in his tax affairs [a] (sic) resulted from  an  error
         by his accountants".

63. And indeed at paragraph  88  the  judge  noted  paragraph  (3)  of  the
    headnote of Ashfaq which states:

         "The explanation by  an  accountant  said  to  have  been  made  or
         contributed to an error is  essential  because  the  allegation  of
         error goes to the professional standing.  Without evidence from the
         accountant the Tribunal may consider that the  facts  laid  by  the
         Secretary of State establish the appellant's dishonesty".

64. The judge proceeded at paragraph 89 to find:

         "I do not accept that the appellant would not  have  been  able  to
         obtain an explanation from JSR who did not close  down  until  mid-
         2017, some eighteen months  after  the  appellant  claims  to  have
         discovered the discrepancy ... The absence of evidence which  could
         reasonably  have  been  expected  to  be  available,  significantly
         reduces the weight that can be placed on the  various  explanations
         offered by the appellant".

65. In the overall context of findings  relating  to  dishonesty,  and  the
    citations from the legal authorities, found the appellant not  credible
    and it is clear that the judge  rejected  the  appellant's  explanation
    that he was not dishonest.

66. Although the findings from paragraph 93 onwards were heavily criticised
    as merely adopting the mantle of the  Secretary  of  State  these  were
    merely a superfluity of findings and clearly indicated that  the  judge
    agreed with the findings of dishonesty made by the Secretary of  State.
    The critical findings of  rejecting  the  appellant's  explanation  had
    already been made by the time the judge  arrived  at  his  confirmatory
    findings at paragraph 93, and at paragraph 94 the judge stated:

         "The burden of proof lay on  the  respondent  in  establishing  the
         facts  on  which  it  relied.   Having  raised  the  suspicion   of
         dishonesty,  and  having   considered   the   appellant's   various
         unsatisfactory explanations, I find that it was entitled  to  infer
         that he had been deceitful or dishonest in relation to  the  income
         declared to the HMRC and/or UKVI for the years  ending  April  2011
         and 2013.  It was a  rational  conclusion  that  he  had  not  been
         completely honest or transparent in relation to his  income  either
         with the Home Office or with HMRC".

67. However, a clear finding at  85  had  been  made  that  the  judge  had
    rejected the appellant's explanation in relation  to  dishonesty.   The
    founding ground of the appeal  was  as  per  Huang,  that  the  judge's
    function was not a reviewing function and that "the appellate authority
    must decide for itself whether the impugned decision was lawful".  From
    the findings cited above in detail it is self-evident  that  the  judge
    found the appellant not credible and dishonest.

68. Even if that were not the case, at the hearing I referred Mr  Biggs  to
    Hassan Gheisari which at paragraph 11 states  that  it  is  permissible
    where the Adjudicator  having  independently  considered  the  question
    agrees with the reasoning given  by  the  Home  Office  refusal  letter
    simply to say so and "the Home  Secretary's  reasons  then  become  the
    Adjudicator's by  express  adoption.   But  if  they  turn  out  to  be
    inadequate, so will the Adjudicator's decision be".

69. What was said in Hassan Gheisari was that what saved the  Adjudicator's
    decision from a deficiency of reasons was that single passage  and  the
    reference to "his evidence lacks the ring of truth" and  the  Court  of
    Appeal stated that:

         "This, I am prepared on consideration to accept, goes beyond simply
         echoing  the  Secretary  of  State's  incredulity.   It  expresses,
         however  laconically,  the  Adjudicator's  own  evaluation  of  the
         veracity of the account that he has been given.  That was his task.
          Although for much of this appeal I was of the view that he  failed
         to perform it, I am prepared in the end to accept,  slender  though
         it is, that it represents his independent judgment on the  critical
         matter upon which the issue of risk to the appellant hinged  namely
         whether he had indeed been arrested, ill-treated and  liberated  as
         he claimed".

70. In this particular instance I consider  that  the  judge's  independent
    reasoning and endorsement of  the  Secretary  of  State's  findings  is
    sufficient  to  conclude  that  the  appellant  was  indeed  dishonest.
    Contrary to the grounds on reading the decision as a whole, it is clear
    that the judge found the appellant to have been dishonest and  this  is
    not merely an assumption.  It is also sufficiently clear that the judge
    found the appellant was in fact dishonest in respect of both  the  HMRC
    and the UKVI because of the use at paragraph 94 of

         "Dishonest in relation to the income declared to  the  HMRC  and/or
         UKVI particularly in light  of  the  second  statement  'it  was  a
         rational conclusion that he  had  not  been  completely  honest  or
         transparent in relation to his income either with the  Home  Office
         or with HMRC'".

71. The grounds submit that the judge did not evaluate  why  the  appellant
    would have submitted correct data to HMRC initially only  to  amend  it
    later if his were to commit a tax fraud.  That is not difficult at all.
     The appellant is recorded as having extracted a declaration of  income
    at a higher rate which was used to support an application to UKVI  then
    overwritten the income and obtained a lower income declaration for  tax
    purposes.  As recorded at paragraph 2 the appellant had made successful
    applications  for  Tier  1  status  in  both  2011  and   2013,   those
    applications were based on an annual income which exceeded  �35,000  in
    those years.

72. It is now known that it is only when applicants  apply  for  indefinite
    leave to remain that their  income  declarations  are  cross-referenced
    with HMRC by the Home Office.

73. In relation to the second ground the judge specifically found therefore
    that the appellant had been dishonest and the judge specifically  noted
    at paragraphs 37(2) of Balajigari which described that  even  dishonest
    conduct may  not  be  sufficiently  reprehensible  to  justify  use  of
    paragraph 322(5) in all cases and it would depend on the circumstances,
    "the guiding  principle  being  that  the  threshold  for  sufficiently
    reprehensible conduct is very high".  The Court of Appeal  specifically
    stated however, that in this regard:

         "We would accept that as a matter of  principle  dishonest  conduct
         will  not  always  in  every  case  reach  a  sufficient  level  of
         seriousness, but in the context of an earnings discrepancy case  it
         is very hard to see how the deliberate and dishonest submission  of
         false earnings figures, whether to HMRC  or  to  the  Home  Office,
         would not do so".

74. The grounds submitted that the judge failed to assess properly  whether
    the conduct was undesirable in the light of (1) reliable evidence,  (2)
    sufficiently reprehensible  conduct,  and  (3)  an  assessment  of  the
    relevant circumstances as at the date of decision.  I  find  the  judge
    had  indeed  when  considering  whether  it  was  undesirable   conduct
    considered  (1)  the  relevant  evidence,  (2)  in  relation   to   the
    sufficiently reprehensible conduct stated in terms at  104  "I  do  not
    accept Mr Biggs'  submission  that  discretion  should  not  have  been
    exercised to refuse leave in the circumstances".  That also  refers  to
    the relevant circumstances.

75. I am not persuaded that the judge failed  to  decide  for  herself  the
    relevant facts and issues as identified above.  The judge had  assessed
    the evidence and as stated found that the appellant was dishonest.   As
    pointed out at paragraph 37, the Court of Appeal stated that:

         "We would accept that as a matter of  principle  dishonest  conduct
         will  not  always  in  every  case  reach  a  sufficient  level  of
         seriousness, but in the context of an earning discrepancy  case  it
         is very hard to see how the deliberate and dishonest submission  of
         false earning figures whether to HMRC or to the Home  Office  would
         not do so".

    It was submitted the judge had not approached the third  limb  properly
    but as I pointed out in the hearing the touchstone was the  dishonesty.
    At 104 the judge did indeed state there must be separate  consideration
    of whether despite the conclusion  that  it  was  undesirable  for  the
    applicant to have leave to  remain  there  were  factors  such  as  the
    welfare of the children who may be affected which  might  outweigh  the
    presumption.  At the close of 104 the judge  specifically  stated  that
    there would "though no doubt only  exceptionally  be  cases  where  the
    interests of children or others or serious problems  about  removal  to
    their country of origin mean that it would be wrong to refuse leave  to
    remain to migrants whose presence is undesirable".  The  judge  clearly
    considered that this fell within one of those non-exceptional cases.

76. Then at 105 the judge did proceed to consider the analysis  of  whether
    notwithstanding  the  conclusion  that  it  was  undesirable  for   the
    applicant to have leave to remain there were  factors  outweighing  the
    presumption such as the welfare  of  any  minor  children  who  may  be
    adversely affected.  I am persuaded that the judge did indeed undertake
    that analysis at paragraph 105 stating "all  relevant  factors  require
    consideration including the interests of the child, which  would  be  a
    primary factor but would not  necessarily  be  sufficiently  strong  to
    outweigh the statutory presumption of refusal of leave under  paragraph
    322(5)".  The judge specifically stated "I do not find there to be  any
    factors which would mean it would be wrong to refuse leave to remain to
    the appellant, as such factors weighing in favour of  his  presence  in
    the UK are not strong".

77. In other words, I find that the judge made  his  consideration  of  the
    first stage of the analysis at paragraph 104  and  the  second  at  105
    having found that the appellant's conduct was dishonest.    A  separate
    analysis of paragraph  276B  in  the  context  of  the  underlying  and
    axiomatic finding of dishonesty would not take the matter further.

78. In relation to ground 3 the child in question is not  even  within  the
    United Kingdom and there is a court order to the effect that the father
    will have contact with the child in the Netherlands.  The father has no
    settled status in the United Kingdom and this must have been  known  to
    the court when a contact order was being made because the appellant  is
    a citizen of Pakistan.  As the judge notes at paragraph  99  the  child
    will remain in the Netherlands with the  mother,  who  is  her  primary
    carer, and he will have to visit her in  the  Netherlands.   The  judge
    made a finding at paragraph 100 that the appellant would be able to set
    up a business in Pakistan and would be able to travel to meet her.   He
    is not expected to have a residence permit as the judge stated  and  he
    had not shown that he would be unable to travel to the Netherlands  for
    the purpose of that visit.  Further, he  would  be  able  to  establish
    contacts in Pakistan relatively quickly.  In effect,  the  judge  found
    that the appellant had not been able to establish on the evidence  that
    he would  be  unable  to  retain  contact  with  the  daughter  in  the
    Netherlands as per the court order.  The judge stated at paragraph  101
    "there is no evidence that their relationship  would  be  significantly
    altered if he lived in Pakistan rather than the  UK  and  continued  to
    keep in touch with her  by  Skype  and  periodic  visits".   There  was
    nothing perverse in that statement.

79. In terms of ground 4 it transpired at the hearing before  me  that  the
    appellant had not provided his solicitors, who in turn had not provided
    Mr Biggs with the previous witness  statement  given  to  his  previous
    solicitors, and that had Mr Biggs seen that previous statement  of  2nd
    January 2020 he would have  been  aware  that  the  oral  evidence  the
    appellant was giving contradicted that statement.

80. As I pointed out in the hearing R v Secretary of  State  for  the  Home
    Department ex parte Doody confirms that it depends on the circumstances
    as to what is fair.   It  may  be  that  the  previous  two  First-tier
    Tribunal decisions had  been  set  aside  but  the  evidence  that  the
    appellant had supplied to the court nevertheless stands particularly if
    it has been in a written sworn witness statement.  That  statement  had
    emanated from the appellant himself and he must have been aware of  its
    existence.

81. That said, the judge found there  were  a  number  of  aspects  to  the
    appellant's account which were inconsistent or contradictory.  In fact,
    the contradiction appears between the November 2020 statement  and  the
    oral evidence.  The January statement appears by way  of  context.   As
    the judge pointed out at paragraph 67 in his November statement of 2020
    the appellant said the second stream of income  was  submitted  without
    his knowledge but to prevent a  late  filing  penalty.   As  the  judge
    identified, it was inconsistent that the appellant claimed to know  why
    Mahmood Accountants submitted these figures to the HMRC and  indeed  Mr
    Biggs invited the Tribunal to excuse the degree  of  speculation.   The
    judge cogently found that the  accountants  would  have  contacted  the
    appellant to finalise the accounts for these years and yet  he  claimed
    he only discovered it in December 2015.   Additionally,  the  appellant
    himself stated at the hearing he only ever had one firm of  accountants
    acting for him at any one time which he also contradicted (see  above).



82. I conclude  that  it  was  open  to  Mr  Biggs  to  put  these  further
    contradictions in re-examination but moreover and importantly  open  to
    the appellant to have provided his  current  representatives  with  the
    witness statement already and previously submitted to the court by  his
    former solicitors, no doubt with the full knowledge of the appellant as
    he signed the sworn witness statement previously tendered.

83. As such, I find no error of law in the First-tier Tribunal decision and
    the decision will stand.


No anonymity direction is made.
