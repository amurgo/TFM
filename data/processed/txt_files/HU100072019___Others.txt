The re-making of the decision in these appeals has been made without a
hearing, pursuant to rule 34 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal)
Rules 2008




                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. This is the re-making of the decision in these five linked appeals. The
    appellants are all citizens of Nepal and are  siblings.  They  are  the
    children of a deceased ex-Gurkha soldier and his widow  (the  sponsor).
    All five appellants made applications for entry  clearance  (deemed  to
    constitute human rights claims) in order to join  the  sponsor  in  the
    United Kingdom. The human rights claims were refused and appeals to the
    First-tier Tribunal dismissed.

 2. By a decision promulgated on 30 July 2021, I found that the  First-tier
    Tribunal had materially erred in law, that its decision should  be  set
    aside, and that the appeals should be retained in  the  Upper  Tribunal
    for a re-making decision to be issued in due course.  In  so  doing,  I
    expressly preserved a number of findings of fact:

          a) the appellant's had lived with the  sponsor  before  she  left
             Nepal in 2018;

          b) all the appellants were unmarried and unemployed;

          c) they were financially dependent on their late father's pension
             (which the sponsor had dedicated for this purpose)  and  on  a
             less regular basis, funds sent over by the sponsor herself;

          d) they continued to live in the family home;

          e) they had all been educated;

          f) the only change in the appellant's  circumstances  since  2018
             was the departure of the sponsor in that year;

          g) it had been a "choice" on  the  sponsor's  part  to  come  and
             settle in this country.

 3. I also issued directions to the parties. In particular, I required  the
    respondent to consider whether a resumed hearing would be necessary, or
    whether these proceedings could be resolved on  the  basis  of  written
    submissions only.

 4. By a response dated 9 August 2021 from Ms Isherwood, Senior  Presenting
    Officer (to whom I am very grateful for her conscientious adherence  to
    the timeframe set out in my directions), the respondent confirmed  that
    in light of the preserved findings of fact and the evidence as a whole,
    the appeals were no longer resisted.

 5. In light of this development, my re-making decision can  be  stated  in
    brief  terms.  Before  doing  so,  I  confirm  that  I  have  carefully
    considered  whether  it  is  fair  to  proceed   without   a   hearing,
    notwithstanding the respondent's stated position. It  is  clear  to  me
    that a resumed hearing is not required. The appeals stand unopposed and
    there is nothing more that the appellant's could seek to offer  by  way
    of oral (or indeed written) submissions.

Remake decision

 6. Having regard to the preserved findings of  fact,  the  evidence  as  a
    whole, and relevant case-law including Rai [2017] EWCA Civ 320,  Gurung
    [2013] 1 WLR 2546, and Ghising (family life - adults -  Gurkha  policy)
    Nepal [2012] UKUT 160 (IAC), I find that  there  is  continuing  family
    life between all of the appellants and the sponsor.

 7. I find that the respondent's refusal of the  appellants'  human  rights
    claims constituted an interference with that family life. There  is  no
    dispute that the decisions were in accordance with the law and  pursued
    a legitimate aim.

 8. Turning to proportionality, I conclude that the historic injustice  (as
    that term is properly understood: see Patel (historic  injustice;  NIAA
    Part 5A) [2020] UKUT 351 (IAC)) is a very  significant  factor  in  the
    appellants'  favour.  On  the  facts  of  these  cases,  there  are  no
    countervailing matters in the respondent's favour such as  to  outweigh
    that very significant factor.

 9. Given the foregoing and the respondent's considered  position  at  this
    stage, I conclude that the refusals of  the  appellants'  human  rights
    claims were disproportionate and therefore unlawful under section 6  of
    the Human Rights Act 1998.

10. It follows that all of these appeals must be allowed.



Anonymity


11. The First-tier Tribunal did not make a direction and there is no reason
    for me to do so. No anonymity direction is made.



Notice of Decision

12. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law and that  decision  has  been  set
    aside.

13. I re-make the decision by allowing all of  the  appeals  on  Article  8
    grounds.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a fee award and  have  decided  to  make  full  fee
awards in each of these appeals.  The  total  amount  awarded  is  therefore
ï¿½700.00.

Officer



                            DECISION AND REASONS


Introduction

 1. The appellants are all citizens of Nepal and the  children  of  an  ex-
    Gurkha soldier and his widow (the sponsor). Collectively,  they  appeal
    against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Moore ("the  judge"),
    promulgated on 23 March 2020. By that decision, the judge dismissed the
    appellants' appeal against the respondent's  decisions,  all  dated  28
    October 2018, refusing  their  human  rights  claims  made  by  way  of
    applications for entry clearance to join  the  sponsor  in  the  United
    Kingdom.

 2. The appeals to the First-tier Tribunal were based on Article 8 ECHR. It
    was said that there was family life  between  the  appellants  and  the
    sponsor before the latter came to settle in the United Kingdom in 2018.
    It was also asserted that the historic  injustice  perpetrated  against
    former Gurkha soldiers and their families represented a decisive factor
    in the proportionality exercise.



The decision of the First-tier Tribunal

 3. The judge accepted the evidence provided  orally  by  the  sponsor  and
    contained in a large  number  of  documents.  With  reference  to  with
    reference to [16]-[25], the judge made the following core  findings  of
    primary fact:

          a) the appellant's had lived with the  sponsor  before  she  left
             Nepal in 2018;

          b) all the appellants were unmarried and unemployed;

          c) they were financially dependent on their late father's pension
             (which the sponsor had dedicated for this purpose)  and  on  a
             less regular basis, funds sent over by the sponsor herself;

          d) they continued to live in the family home;

          e) they had all been educated;

          f) the only change in the appellant's  circumstances  since  2018
             was the departure of the sponsor in that year;

          g) it had been a "choice" on  the  sponsor's  part  to  come  and
             settle in this country.

 4. The judge also implied  that  he  accepted  that  there  was  a  causal
    connection between the historic injustice and the fact that the  family
    unit had not tried to settle in the United Kingdom earlier.

 5. Notwithstanding his findings, the judge went on to conclude that  there
    was no family life between the appellants  and  the  sponsor.  He  then
    concluded, in the alternative, that  the  respondent's  decisions  were
    proportionate.



The grounds of appeal and grant of permission

 6. The grounds of appeal are fairly lengthy but can be  condensed  to  two
    central assertions: first, that the judge had failed to  give  adequate
    reasons for his finding on family life;  second,  that  the  judge  had
    failed to have regard to the guidance on  the  importance  of  historic
    injustice,  as  set  out  in  a  number  of  authorities.  In  granting
    permission, First-tier Tribunal Judge Landes found these two points  in
    particular to be arguable.



The hearing

 7. Mr Ahmed relied on the grounds  and  expanded  on  them  in  a  concise
    manner, referring to a number of  well-known  cases  involving  Gurkhas
    (Rai [2017] EWCA Civ 320, Gurung [2013] 1 WLR 2546, and Ghising -adults-
    Gurkha policy) [2012] UKUT 00160 (IAC)).

 8. Ms Isherwood submitted that the judge had directed himself properly and
    had  undertaken  a  fact-sensitive  assessment  of  the  evidence.  She
    submitted that the judge had not committed any errors of law which were
    material to the outcome. She noted that the  judge  had  not  made  any
    specific findings on the existence of emotional dependency and had made
    a reference to money  being  "borrowed"  by  the  appellants,  with  no
    explanation for this provided.



Conclusions on error of law

 9. As I announced to the parties at the hearing, I conclude that the judge
    did err in law and that his decision should be set aside.

10. The findings of primary fact clearly pointed in the  direction  of  the
    existence of family life between the appellants and the sponsor. It  is
    implicit that there was family life prior to the sponsor's departure in
    2018. The judge found that there had been no  material  change  in  the
    appellants' circumstances save for that event.  They  were  financially
    dependent on the sponsor, lived in the same family home,  and  had  not
    established independent lives of their own. In light  of  this  factual
    matrix and the guidance from relevant authorities,  it  required  clear
    reasons from the judge to support a conclusion that there was  in  fact
    no family life. That the judge correctly directed himself  to  relevant
    authorities does not equate with the provision of adequate reasons.

11. I am bound to say that I cannot detect any such reasons. The fact  that
    the sponsor "chose" to settle in the United Kingdom was not an adequate
    basis to reject  the  existence  of  family  life.  As  made  clear  at
    paragraph 39 of Rai, focusing on the issue of "choice" is to avoid  the
    core question of fact, namely whether the family life which had existed
    previously, continued.  The  judge  also  failed  to  engage  with  the
    uncontentious fact that the appellants had applied to  come  to  United
    Kingdom at the same time as the sponsor, thus indicating  a  desire  to
    maintain the pre-existing family life (see paragraph  42  of  Rai).  In
    respect of the "borrowed" money point highlighted by Ms  Isherwood  and
    referring to [14] of the judge's decision, this was not of  concern  to
    him, as he made no reference to it when setting out  his  findings  and
    conclusions. Finally, it is true  that  the  judge  has  not  expressly
    referred to emotional dependency.  However,  at  [15]  the  judge  made
    reference to the submissions put forward on the appellants'  behalf  as
    regards cultural norms, as these informed both emotional and  financial
    dependency in situations where adult siblings had not yet formed  their
    own independent lives. There is nothing  in  the  judge's  decision  to
    indicate that he did not accept the thrust of this submission. At best,
    there is a lacuna in the judge's assessment which could only favour the
    appellants' current challenge.

12. The absence of adequate reasons in light of  the  findings  of  primary
    fact is an error of law. It is a material error of law because  of  the
    judge's approach to his alternative conclusion  that  the  respondent's
    decisions were proportionate.

13. The overall effect of the guidance set out in a  number  of  well-known
    authorities is that the historic injustice perpetrated  against  former
    Gurkha soldiers and their  families  is  a  very  significant,  if  not
    decisive, factor in the balancing exercise (see, for  example,  Gurung,
    Ghising and others (Ghurkhas/BOCs: historic wrong; weight) [2013]  UKUT
    567 (IAC), and Patel (historic injustice; NIAA Part 5A) [2020] UKUT 351
    (IAC)).

14. Weight is of course usually a matter  solely  for  the  first  instance
    tribunal to attribute. However, in Gurkha cases, the historic injustice
    has, exceptionally, being accorded particularly significant  weight  in
    general terms. This should be the starting point of the  judge  in  any
    given case. Here, and with particular reference  to  what  is  said  at
    [26], the judge has in effect relied on his findings  of  primary  fact
    (which, in the alternative scenario, went  to  show  the  existence  of
    family  life)  as  the  basis  for  concluding  that  the  respondent's
    decisions were proportionate. In other words, the very fact of  showing
    family life ultimately defeated the Article 8 claim.  In  my  judgment,
    this is an error in approach: the judge  did  not  actually  apply  the
    guidance set out in the authorities.  Further,  or  alternatively,  the
    judge failed to provide adequate reasons  as  to  how  he  reached  his
    conclusion on the balancing exercise. Either way, he erred in law.



Disposal

15. There is no question of these appeals being remitted to the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

16. There is no reason to disturb the judge's findings of primary fact  and
    I expressly preserve these in respect of the re-making of the decisions
    in these appeals. For the avoidance of any doubt,  those  findings  are
    set out in paragraph 3 of my error of law decision and at [16]-[25]  of
    the judge's decision.

17. I discussed  what  should  happen  next  with  representatives  at  the
    hearing. The following course of action was agreed:

          a) the error of law decision will be sent out to the parties;

          b) the appellant's  shall  ensure  that  the  two  bundles  filed
             previously (that which was before the First-tier Tribunal  and
             the updated bundle received by the Upper Tribunal on  20  July
             2021) are served on Ms Isherwood;

          c) having considered the evidence in light of  my  error  of  law
             decision, Ms Isherwood will then  inform  the  Upper  Tribunal
             whether the respondent seeks a resumed hearing or whether  the
             decisions in these appeals can fairly be re-made on the  basis
             of written submissions only;

          d) the appellant's of than have an opportunity to respond;

          e) the Upper Tribunal will then decide on the appropriate  course
             of action in respect of the  re-making  of  the  decisions  in
             these appeals.



Anonymity


18. The First-tier Tribunal did not make an anonymity direction and there
    is no reason for me to do so.



Notice of Decision

19. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.


20. I exercise my discretion  under  section  12(2)(a)  of  the  Tribunals,
    Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 and set aside the decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal.

21. The decisions in these appeals will be re-made by the Upper Tribunal in
    due course.



Directions to the parties

   1. No later than 3 days after this error of law decision is sent out, the
      appellants shall serve on the respondent (specifically, Ms  Isherwood)
      the two bundles of evidence referred to earlier;

   2. No later than 14 days after this error of law decision  is  sent  out,
      the respondent shall confirm with the Upper Tribunal (copying  in  the
      appellants) whether: (i) she seeks a resumed hearing; or (ii)  whether
      the re-making of the decisions in these appeals can take place on  the
      basis of written submissions only;

   3. If the respondent is to rely on written submissions only, these should
      if possible be filed and served at the same time as  the  confirmation
      provided under Direction 2;

   4. If Direction 3 cannot be complied with, the respondent shall file  and
      serve the written submissions no later than 21 days after  this  error
      of law decision is sent out;

   5. If the respondent seeks to  rely  on  written  submissions  only,  the
      appellant's shall file and serve written submissions no later  than  7
      days after receiving the respondent's written submissions;

   6. If a resumed hearing is  required,  the  Upper  Tribunal  shall  issue
      further directions in due course;

   7. With liberty to apply.
