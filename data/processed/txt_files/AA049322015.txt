For the Respondent:    Mr P Nath of the Specialist Appeals Team

                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appellant

 1. The Appellant is an Albanian national born on  28  December  1998.   He
    states he arrived on 24 November 2013.  Two days later he  applied  for
    asylum on the basis that he feared to return  to  Albania  because  his
    family was involved in a blood feud.

The Respondent's Decision

 2. On 3 May 2015 the Respondent refused the  Appellant's  application  for
    subsidiary protection and also his claim that his removal would  breach
    his rights to a private and life protected by Article 8 of the European
    Convention.  The Respondent decided to remove the Appellant to  Albania
    by way of directions under Section 47 of the  Immigration,  Asylum  and
    Nationality Act 2006.

 3. On 19 March 2015 the Appellant lodged notice of appeal under Section 82
    of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002  as  amended  (the
    2002 Act).  The grounds assert that the Appellant's family  is  engaged
    in a blood feud on account of which he fled  and  fears  to  return  to
    Albania.  The  other  grounds  assert  the  Appellant  cannot  relocate
    elsewhere in Albania and general  disagreement  with  the  Respondent's
    decision.

The First-tier Tribunal Proceedings

 4. By a decision promulgated on 9 September 2015 Judge of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal N M Paul made extensive adverse credibility  findings  against
    the Appellant and dismissed his appeal on all grounds.

 5. On 6 October 2015 Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Cruthers granted the
    Appellant permission to appeal on the ground that it was  arguable  the
    Judge had erred in  law  in  failing  sufficiently  to  deal  with  the
    assessment of the Appellant's best interests as a child with regard  to
    the Respondent's duty under Section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship  and
    Immigration Act  2009.   Additionally,  it  was  arguable  the  Judge's
    attention had not been drawn to the Respondent's policy on the grant of
    leave to and removal of Unaccompanied Asylum-Seeking Children and  that
    the Judge should have considered whether the  Respondent  had  complied
    with her obligation to trace the Appellant's family in Albania. Further
    it was arguable he had not given sufficient  reasons  for  his  summary
    disposal of the Appellant's claim under Article 8.

The Upper Tribunal Hearing

 6. The Appellant attended  accompanied  by  his  foster  carer  Ms  Sharon
    Anderson.  She confirmed he had excellent English and I  explained  the
    purpose of the hearing and the procedure to be adopted.

 7. I drew the attention of the representatives to  the  fact  that  on  28
    December, just  eight  days  before  the  hearing,  the  Appellant  had
    celebrated  his  17th  birthday.   I  referred  the  parties   to   the
    Respondent's guidance of April 2013 "Processing an  Asylum  Application
    from a Child: Instruction".  This is to be  found  in  the  Appellant's
    bundle and appears  to  be  the  current  version.   Paragraph  17.9(a)
    includes:-

         Children who are refused outright because they  are  over  17�  but
         under 18 years of age should  have  their  removal  deferred  until
         their  18th  birthday,  unless  the  safe  and  adequate  reception
         arrangements test has been met.  This undertaking  should  be  made
         clear in the reasons for refusal letter.

    Given the decision was made when the Appellant was under 16�  years  of
    age, it appeared to me there were a number of issues  and  I  intimated
    that in the circumstances I intended to find the First-tier  Tribunal's
    decision  contained  errors  of  law  and  to  deal  with  the   matter
    substantively with a view to finding the Respondent's decision to  have
    been  made  otherwise  than  in  accordance   with   the   law.    Both
    representatives agreed that that was a sensible and  pragmatic  way  to
    proceed.

 8. The Respondent considered extensively her obligation to have regard  to
    the best interests of the Appellant as a child in her letter of 3 March
    2015 giving  reasons  for  refusing  the  Appellant's  application  for
    further leave but the Judge having made an adverse credibility  finding
    against the Appellant failed adequately to consider his best  interests
    as a primary consideration and to make findings on them.

 9. The Respondent's decision provided for  removal  of  the  Appellant  to
    Albania.  The reasons letter stated the British Embassy in  Tirana  had
    verified the Appellant's identity and his family details but there  was
    no evidence in the Tribunal file to support this statement or otherwise
    to  indicate  what  reception  arrangements  would  be  made  for   the
    Appellant.  Further, the Judge made no reference to the judgment in  TN
    and M (Afghanistan) v SSHD [2015] UKSC 40 delivered  on  24  June  2015
    which dealt with the Respondent's obligations to trace an unaccompanied
    minor's family.

10. On account of these matters I find the First-tier  Tribunal's  decision
    contained errors of law such that it should be set aside.

11. With the agreement of the parties, I proceeded to  a  consideration  of
    the substantive appeal  and  in  the  light  of  the  Respondent's  own
    guidance already mentioned, I find the decision was not  in  accordance
    with the law and the appeal is allowed to the extent  that  it  remains
    for the Respondent to make  a  lawful  decision.  Both  representatives
    indicated they agreed that was the best way to proceed.

Anonymity

12.  There was no request for an anonymity direction  or  order  and  having
    considered the appeal I found none is  warranted,  notwithstanding  the
    Appellant's age.

NOTICE OF DECISION

    The First-tier Tribunal decision contained errors of  law  and  is  set
    aside in its entirety.  The following decision is substituted:-
