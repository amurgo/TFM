                  DEPUTY JUDGE OF THE UPPER TRIBUNAL CHANA

                                   Between

                THE SECETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                          MRS Mary ARINZE EKWUNIFE
                        (no anonymity direction made)
                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

For the Appellant:          Mr M Hay, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr Kandola, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.      The appellant before the Upper Tribunal is the  Secretary  of  State
   for the Home Department and the respondent is a citizen of  Nigeria  born
   on 1 May 1952.  However, for the sake of convenience I shall refer to the
   latter as the "appellant" and to  the  Secretary  of  the  State  as  the
   "respondent", which are the designations  they  had  in  the  proceedings
   before the First-tier Tribunal.



2.    The appellant's appeal to the  First-tier  Tribunal  was  against  the
   decision  of  the  respondent  dated  8  September  2014  cancelling  the
   appellant's leave to remain as a visitor because the appellant had either
   made false representations or had employed material  facts  and  had  not
   disclosed material facts for the  purposes  of  obtaining  entry  to  the
   United Kingdom pursuant to 322 of the Immigration Rules.



3.       Judge Samimi allowed the appellant's appeal. Permission  to  appeal
   to the Upper Tribunal was granted by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Ransley
   who found that it is arguable that the Judge's decision involved arguable
   errors of law that might have made a material difference to  the  outcome
   of the appeal. The appellant had admitted having practised  deception  in
   procuring a false entry stamp in her Nigerian passport and the Judge  may
   arguably have erred in not taking into account the effect of deception on
   the appellant's credibility




4.        Thus the appeal came before me.




   First-tier Tribunal's findings


5.       The First-tier Tribunal allowed the appellant's appeal,  concluding
   that:



          [2] the appellant arrived in the United Kingdom on 27  April  2014
          with leave to enter as a multi-visit visitor which leave was valid
          until 9 July 2018. On arrival the  appellant  indicated  that  her
          intention was to visit her daughter. The appellant  was  found  to
          have previously visited her daughter in 2010 and in 2013.  In  the
          course  of  her  interview  with  the  immigration  officer,   the
          appellant had stated that her  intention  was  to  remain  in  the
          United Kingdom for four weeks and that she had previously  visited
          her daughter in April 2008 for two weeks. The immigration  officer
          noted that the appellant  had  actually  remained  in  the  United
          Kingdom until 23 August  2010.  The  appellant  is  said  to  have
          admitted to have obtained the said entry endorsement by deception,
          from a Nigerian immigration officer by paying 1000 naira in  cash.
          The immigration officer  concluded  that  the  appellant's  actual
          visit of 182 days from 23 February 2010 to  23  August  2010,  not
          only breached the conditions of  entry  clearance,  but  that  the
          fraudulent had been subsequently  used  to  obtain  another  visa,
          which was issued  in  2013  for  three  months.  Accordingly,  the
          appellant leave was cancelled in accordance  with  paragraph  321A
          (2) of the immigration rules.


          [5] I find that the fact the  appellant  has  admitted  to  having
          exercised deception in facilitating  a  false  entry  Stamp  in  a
          passport, renders the immigration officer's decision to cancel her
          latest leave to enter as the correct one. However,  the  appellant
          has now been served with a s120 notice of additional grounds, as a
          result of which she has submitted additional  grounds  of  appeal,
          namely the right to remain in the  United  Kingdom  in  accordance
          with the 2006 EEA  Regulations  as  well  as  in  accordance  with
          Article 8 of the ECHR.


          [9] On the totality of the evidence before me, including the  oral
          and documentary evidence of the appellant, her daughter and son-in-
          law, I find that all three witnesses  have  provided  genuine  and
          truthful evidence of the nature  and  extent  of  the  appellant's
          dependency on her daughter and son-in-law which includes financial
          and emotional dependency. The appellant had given her own position
          in Nigeria which is that of a retired teacher  (retired  in  2010)
          earning 60,000 naira per month. In relation to the  issue  of  the
          appellant's dependency, there is evidence before me, in  the  form
          of the money transfer agency receipts to show that  the  appellant
          was financially supported by her daughter and son  in  law,  while
          she was in Nigeria. The appellant's dependency on her daughter and
          son-in-law has increased since her arrival in the  United  Kingdom
          in April 2014, to the extent that she is now wholly  dependent  on
          the financial support provided by them, but this also now  extends
          to emotional support. In turn the appellant provides valuable help
          and support to her daughter's family, the form  of  childcare  and
          housework. All three witnesses have  explained  that  without  the
          appellant support, her daughter and son in law would not  be  able
          to carry out their full-time jobs. The appellant's daughter  works
          as a registered community nurse earning ï¿½1714 per month which  has
          been demonstrated by the  wage  slips  enclosed.  The  appellant's
          husband works  and  earns  approximately  the  same  amount  as  a
          psychiatry care worker.  The  appellant  does  have  two  sons  in
          Nigeria but all three witnesses have explained that she  does  not
          have a  positive  relationship  with  them  and  they  have  never
          provided her with any form of support.


          [10] I find that there is sufficient evidence before  me,  in  the
          form of documentary and oral evidence to show that  the  appellant
          has been wholly dependent on her EEA sponsors,  for  her  physical
          and  emotional  support,  as   well   as   being   provided   with
          accommodation  and  financial  support.  The  appellant  is  fully
          reliant on her daughter and son-in-law for her financial  support,
          accommodation as well as emotional support. This has  strengthened
          and developed to a mutual dependency,  as  without  the  childcare
          provided by her, her daughter and son-in-law would not be able  to
          work full-time and carry out valuable work to  the  community.  He
          has taken into consideration the case of Reyes  (EEA:  dependency)
          [2013] UKUT 00314 (IAC) at paragraph 19.


          [12] On the totality of the evidence before me, I  find  that  the
          respondent's  decision  is  not  in  accordance   with   the   EEA
          regulations 2006. On the balance of probabilities, I find that the
          appellant has satisfied the requirements of regulation  7  of  the
          2006 Regulations.




       Grounds of appeal




6.       The respondent's grounds  of  appeal  are  the  following  which  I
   summarise. The first ground of appeal is that the Judge made  a  material
   misdirection in law because having found that the appellant  had  made  a
   false representation in submitting a Nigerian passport which contained an
   entry endorsement which she admitted to having obtained by deception from
   a Nigerian immigration officer by paying in cash and nevertheless finding
   that the appellant has a right to remain under the EEA Regulations as her
   son-in-law's dependent. The Judge has not given sufficient reasons as  to
   why the documentary evidence produced to corroborate  the  dependency  on
   the EEA national sponsor is reliable. Furthermore, having found that  the
   appellant has clearly exercised deception, the Judge went on at paragraph
   9 of the determination to find credible  in  relation  to  evidence  with
   regards to her dependency. Having found that the appellant had  willingly
   exercise deception, any further evidence would have been treated with the
   circumscription. The Judge has failed to give adequate  reasons  for  why
   the appellant was credible having made an adverse finding against her.




7.       The second ground of appeal is that the Judge  did  not  take  into
   account the case of Moneke  (EEA-OFM's-assessment  of  evidence)  Nigeria
   [2011]  UKUT  00430  IAC  which  provides  that  in  determining  appeals
   regarding OFM applications made in  country,  immigration  Judges  should
   scrutinise with some care the supporting evidence, in  order  to  satisfy
   themselves that the burden of proof  demonstrating  legibility  has  been
   discharged. The  Judge  has  failed  to  have  regard  to  the  principle
   enunciated in this case.



8.       The appellant has misrepresented her intention when  seeking  entry
   as a visitor. Having  found  the  appellant  had  exercise  deception  by
   presenting a false entry stamp any evidence now submitted in  support  of
   the  dependency  should  have  been   approached   with   circumspection.
   Furthermore, the visits and lifestyle by the appellant were  inconsistent
   with the requirements of dependency. The  appellant  had  to  demonstrate
   financial support was being provided for essential living needs. This was
   clearly not the case. Support of a certain lifestyle does not  equate  to
   dependency.




       Submissions at the hearing



9.       Mr Kandola said that the appellant  has  not  been  an  application
   under the EEA regulations for leave to remain. He said that the appellant
   has not provided evidence that her dependency is not one  of  choice  but
   essential for her day-to-day living. The  appellant  was  a  teacher  and
   therefore is not destitute. The  Judge  has  not  assessed  the  evidence
   properly.




10.  Ms Hay said that the presumption must  be  that  the  determination  is
   correct. The determination can only be discharged on an error of law.  In
   order to succeed it must be shown that the outcome of the case would have
   been different. The Judge was alive to the issue of deception and made an
   express finding of that. It was also the centre theme in the respondent's
   refusal letter. Dependency  is  a  separate  issue.  The  witnesses  were
   credible as explained by  the  Judge  in  the  determination.  There  was
   sufficient documentary evidence of payments  to  the  appellant  such  as
   ï¿½1000 or more. The appellant was dependent on her sponsors in the  United
   Kingdom before she came here. The Judge found that the  appellant  has  a
   genuine financial dependency on her sponsors to meet her  primary  needs.
   The daughter's evidence which Judge relied upon stated that not  only  is
   the appellant wholly dependent on her sponsors but she is now emotionally
   dependent on them as well. The Judge explored with the witnesses  at  the
   hearing the concept of the mutual dependency between  them.  The  Judge's
   determination and findings are in line with the case of Moneke.




11.  Mr  Kandola  in  reply  stated  that  if  the  appellant  is  genuinely
   dependent, why did she not make an application for a family permit  under
   the 2006 regulations? There is no evidence set out in  the  determination
   that the appellant was dependent on her sponsors from Nigeria. It appears
   from the evidence that her  sponsors  are  dependent  on  her  doing  the
   housework and looking after her grandchildren.




       Discussion and Findings




12. The appeal therefore involves two steps, the first  being  to  determine
   whether there is an error of law in the determination of  the  first-tier
   Judge and the second, if I find there was an error, to hear  evidence  or
   submissions to enable me to remake  the  decision  whether  she  succeeds
   under the EEA regulations




13. The complaint made against the determination is the fact that the  judge
   did not adequately consider that the  evidence  that  the  appellant  had
   practised deception by  having  obtained  a  false  entry  stamp  from  a
   Nigerian immigration officer in order to show her date of departure  from
   the United Kingdom  has  March  2010,  instead  of  the  actual  date  of
   departure which was 23 August 2010 which would have demonstrated that she
   was in breach of her visa conditions by not leaving the country in  time.
   The appellant admitted as much and therefore the Judge should have  taken
   this into account in evaluating the appellant's evidence  in  respect  of
   her dependency on her EEA national sponsors in the United Kingdom and her
   evidence should have been treated with circumspection.




14. The Judge at paragraph 4 and 5 of the determination made  it  abundantly
   clear that she was very much alive to the fact  that  the  appellant  had
   resorted to deception and the respondent's decision to cancel  her  leave
   was correctly made. The Judge however stated  "on  the  totality  of  the
   evidence before her, including the oral and documentary evidence  of  the
   appellant, her daughter and son-in-law, I find that all  three  witnesses
   have provided General Electric and evidence on the nature and  extent  of
   the appellant's dependency on her daughter and son-in-law which  includes
   financial and emotional dependency".




15. This demonstrates  that  the  Judge  took  into  account  not  only  the
   appellant's evidence but that  of  her  sponsors,  including  documentary
   evidence that they have been  supporting  the  appellant  in  Nigeria  by
   sending her money. Although the Judge has not implicitly stated that  she
   considers the appellant's evidence with  care  because  of  her  previous
   deception, it is clear from the reading of the entire determination  that
   she is relying on other reliable and cogent evidence and not only that of
   the appellant.




16. The  Judge  set  out  all  the  evidence  that  the  appellant  provided
   including financial support of between ï¿½3000-ï¿½4000  per  year.  She  took
   into account that the appellant's salary from her teaching  job  was  not
   sufficient and without the support of her sponsors in the United Kingdom,
   the appellant would have otherwise suffered financial hardship. She  took
   into account the salaries that her sponsors and in this country  to  show
   that they had the financial strength to support the  appellant  while  in
   Nigeria and in the United Kingdom.




17. Unlike the Immigration Rules, there is nothing in the  2006  regulations
   which states that if the person has been deceptive in any application  in
   the past, any  future  applications  by  the  applicant  under  the  2006
   Regulations must be denied. If the appellant met the requirements of  the
   2006 regulations, there is nothing to preclude her from being issued with
   a residence permit as a family member of an EEA national.




18. I have  considered  the  determination  with  anxious  scrutiny  to  see
   whether there is a material error of law within it. The  Judge  did  take
   into account the appellant's fraudulent behaviour but  found  that  there
   was other evidence which corroborated the appellant's evidence. There  is
   no material error of law in the Judge's consideration of the evidence and
   the conclusions he reached on it.




  19. The respondent's appeal is merely  a  disagreement  with  the  Judge's
      decision. A  different  Judge  may  well  have  come  to  a  different
      conclusion on the same facts but that still does not mean  that  there
      is a material error in the determination of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
      Judge and his decision stands.




      DECISION

For the reasons given above, the determination of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
is upheld and the Secretary of State's appeal is dismissed.
