                             NOTICE OF DECISION

    1. Both subparagraphs of rule 40(3) apply to this decision.

    2. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal sent out on 8  June  2017  is
       erroneous in law.  We set it aside.

    3. We substitute a decision allowing the appeals on the ground that  the
       decisions under appeal were not in accordance with the law, with  the
       effect that the respondent's applications to the Secretary  of  State
       are outstanding and await lawful decisions.




                               Signed
