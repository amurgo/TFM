For the Appellant:     Ms R Kotak, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr S Walker, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Nigeria whose date of birth  is  recorded
    as 17th August 1965.  On 11th September 2015 he  made  application  for
    leave to remain in the United Kingdom on human rights grounds.  On 25th
    January 2016 a decision  was  made  to  refuse  the  application.   The
    Appellant appealed.  On 5th June 2017 the appeal was heard by Judge  of
    the First-tier Tribunal G Jones QC, sitting  at  Hatton  Cross.   Judge
    Jones dismissed the appeal.  Not content with that decision  by  Notice
    dated 12th June 2017 the Appellant made application for  permission  to
    appeal to the Upper Tribunal.  On 14th December 2017 Judge of the First-
    tier Tribunal Brunnen granted permission.

 2. Given the way in which this  matter  proceeded  before  me  it  is  not
    necessary for me to set out in any great detail the background but  the
    principal complaint made by the Appellant was that by the time  of  the
    hearing in the First-tier Tribunal he, the Appellant, had been lawfully
    in the United Kingdom for ten years and his eldest child  had  been  in
    the United Kingdom for over eight years.  It was argued that the  judge
    had erred in law because he took the relevant date as the date  of  the
    application  rather  than  the  date  of  the  hearing.   Additionally,
    although reference was made to Section 55 of the  Borders,  Citizenship
    and Immigration Act 2009, no sufficient consideration if any was  given
    to the  statutory  provisions  in  Section  117B(6)  which  relates  to
    children who have been in the United Kingdom for seven  years  provided
    they are qualifying children, which in this case the  particular  child
    was.

 3. Mr Walker conceded quite properly, and I would have found in any event,
    that there was a material error of law.  The Appellant  had  filed  and
    served a 'Section 120 Notice' which  ought  to  have  been  taken  into
    account by the judge but was not and so I set aside the decision of the
    First-tier Tribunal and remake the decision.  Again I am grateful to Mr
    Walker because he accepts that in the remaking, given  the  ten  years'
    lawful residence, and given the change in circumstances which have  now
    happened in relation both to the Appellant and to his partner  who  now
    has status in the United Kingdom and still further, given  the  failure
    to consider Section 117B(6), Mr Walker accepts quite properly that  the
    appeal should be allowed.  Again,  I  would  have  so  found.   In  the
    circumstances the appeal is allowed.

Notice of Decision

 4. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set  aside.   I  remake  the
    decision such that the appeal is allowed.

 5. No anonymity direction is made.
