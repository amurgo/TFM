                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS



    Introduction

    1.     The Appellant appealed with  permission  granted  by  First-tier
         Tribunal Judge Kelly on 30 January 2018 against  the  determination
         of First-tier Tribunal Judge Moore who had dismissed the appeal  of
         the Appellant seeking settlement outside the Immigration  Rules  on
         Article 8 ECHR family life grounds.  She is married  to  a  British
         Citizen. The decision and reasons  was  promulgated  on  14  August
         2017.

    2.     The Appellant is a  national  of  Jamaica.   The  Appellant  had
         entered the United Kingdom lawfully as a visitor on  6  July  2002,
         with nominal leave to enter for 6 months.  She failed to leave  the
         United Kingdom either then or after her  various  applications  for
         further leave to remain were  refused.   Her  previous  appeal  was
         dismissed by the First-tier Tribunal in 2014.  On 25 February  2013
         she had been cautioned for attempting to obtain  a  forged  British
         passport.  On 23 May 2015 she married her British  Citizen  husband
         with whom  she  had  lived  since  2006.   The  Appellant's  latest
         application under appeal  was  against  the  Respondent's  decision
         dated 27 April 2015.  That appeal had been allowed  by  the  First-
         tier Tribunal on 11 July 2016 but the Respondent appealed  and  the
         First-tier Tribunal's decision was set aside the Upper Tribunal and
         sent back to the First-tier Tribunal to be reheard.

    3.     The gravamen of the present appeal was the  Appellant's  claimed
         parental relationship with her (step) grandchildren, in  particular
         her 12 year old grandson who had been diagnosed  as  autistic  with
         learning  difficulties.   The  judge  found  that  there  were   no
         insurmountable obstacles to the continuation of  family  life  with
         the Appellant's husband outside the United  Kingdom,  which  was  a
         matter of choice as the husband had  always  been  aware  that  the
         Appellant's status was precarious.  The Appellant did not meet  the
         Suitability requirements  of  Appendix  FM,  nor  were  there  very
         significant obstacles to her reintegration in Jamaica where she had
         lived to the age of 24.  The judge was satisfied that  the  welfare
         and needs of all of the (step) children  and  (step)  grandchildren
         (including the autistic step grandson) were best met  by  remaining
         in the United Kingdom  where  they  had  always  lived  with  their
         respective parents.  There were no  exceptional  circumstances  and
         the Respondent's decision in pursuit of a legitimate objective  and
         was proportionate.

    4.     Permission to appeal was granted on  a  limited  basis.  It  was
         considered arguable that  the  judge  had  erred  in  reaching  the
         conclusion that the Appellant did not have a parental  relationship
         with her  step  grandson.   The  judge  had  not  given  sufficient
         attention to the expert's report (Dr Halari) which showed that  her
         assessment had  been  based  on  observation  as  well  as  on  the
         information given by the Appellant and the  child's  mother.   That
         was arguably a material error of law which could have affected  the
         outcome of the appeal.

    5.     Standard directions were made  by  the  tribunal.    A  rule  24
         notice opposing the appeal was filed by the Respondent.

    Submissions

    6.     Ms McCarthy for the Appellant relied on the grounds  of  onwards
         appeal and grant.  Agyarko [2017] UKSC applied  to  reasonableness.
         The judge had misunderstood and had not  dealt  properly  with  the
         expert evidence concerning the 12 year old autistic step  grandson.
         This was not a case where the  expert  had  relied  solely  on  the
         information given by the Appellant and the child's mother,  as  the
         judge had suggested.  The expert had identified  her  duty  to  the
         tribunal.  The expert's report described her  own  observations  of
         the relationship, which plainly were part of the evidence on  which
         her opinion had  been  based.   This  bore  directly  on  the  best
         interests assessment, which was flawed.   Weight  was  due  to  the
         expert's opinion which was not given.  The needs  of  the  autistic
         child and the effect of the step grandmother's absence from him had
         not been adequately considered.  The determination  should  be  set
         aside and remade.

    7.     Ms Isherwood for the Respondent relied on the rule 24 notice and
         submitted  that  there  was  plainly  no  material  error  of  law.
         Devaseelan (Second Appeals - ECHR - Extra-Territorial  Effect)  Sri
         Lanka * [2002]  UKIAT  00702  applied  to  the  earlier  First-tier
         Tribunal determination, the one which had not been  set  aside  and
         the judge had been right to  refer  to  it.   The  expert's  report
         expressly stated that the  sources  of  information  had  been  the
         Appellant and her step daughter in law.  The judge had  interpreted
         the expert's report  correctly  and  the  judge's  Article  8  ECHR
         findings were open to him. The substance of Agyarko in the  Supreme
         Court had been applied.  The onwards appeal should be dismissed.

    No material error of law finding

    8.     In the tribunal's view the grant of  permission  to  appeal  was
         generous, and failed to reflect the fact that  the  appeal  was  in
         reality a misconceived one, with weak evidence.   Unfortunately  it
         is typical of many appeals seen  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and
         again in the Upper Tribunal involving couples seeking  to  rely  on
         Article 8 ECHR grounds.  Had the Appellant returned to  Jamaica  in
         2006  as  she  should  have  done,  or  indeed  at  various  points
         subsequently as each succession application was refused, she  would
         have been able to enter the United  Kingdom  to  join  her  husband
         under the  far  less  stringent  provisions  of  the  now  repealed
         paragraph 281 of the Immigration Rules.   Those  Immigration  Rules
         were replaced by from 9  July  2012  by  the  much  more  demanding
         provisions of Appendix FM.    There  was  no  evidence  that  those
         provisions could not with appropriate  efforts  be  complied  with,
         subject of  course  to  the  Suitability  issue  arising  from  the
         Appellant's caution.  The current unhappy situation was created  by
         the parties.  Compliance with the law is not a matter of individual
         choice.  Time and money have been wasted  seeking  the  impossible,
         when other solutions were available.

    9.     Rightly there was no further attempt to  challenge  the  judge's
         other findings of fact concerning the Appellant's family life  with
         her husband, and the ability for their family life to be  continued
         in Jamaica.  Rather the focus of the  onwards  appeal  was  on  the
         Appellant's  allegedly  parental   relationship   with   her   step
         grandson.  This claim  in  itself  was  misconceived  and  was  not
         supported  by  cogent  evidence.   The  grandson  lives  with   his
         competent and loving mother, as the judge found.  The mother is the
         effective sole  parent,  where  the  child's  emotional  dependency
         lies.  The judge found, for secure reasons,  that  the  Appellant's
         r�le in her step grandson's life was in effect as a babysitter, and
         that the extent of her involvement was exaggerated: see [24] of the
         decision and reasons.  That r�le is, of  course,  typical  in  many
         families where grandparents provide free child  care  enabling  the
         parent(s) to work or have  respite  from  constant  responsibility.
           This is of particular value in this family as  the  care  of  an
         autistic child is demanding.

    10.    The submissions that the judge had misunderstood the Appellant's
         r�le, failing  to  see  that  it  had  a  therapeutic  or  parental
         dimension which the child's mother alone was unable to supply,  and
         had given no or insufficient weight to the expert's report, had  no
         substance.   As  Ms  Isherwood  pointed  out  at,  the  sources  of
         information referred to by the expert were the  Appellant  and  her
         step daughter: see, e.g., [3], [11], [23] and [28] of  the  report.
         That had to be so because  the  report  was  prepared  following  a
         single interview.  The observations recorded  by  the  expert  were
         partly qualified, e.g., at [53] of the report the  term  chosen  is
         "seemed" when discussing the  child's  emotional  dependency.   The
         judge was entitled to give limited weight to the report for all  of
         the reasons he gave, in particular his finding that  the  Appellant
         and her step daughter had embellished their evidence and  that  the
         allegedly quasi parental relationship had not been advanced in 2014
         despite the opportunity to do so.  The child concerned was 12 years
         old at the date of the appeal hearing and had  received  specialist
         infant  educational  provision:  see  the  school  report  in   the
         Appellant's bundle of evidence.   His school provision  is  plainly
         of great importance, coupled with his mother's understanding of his
         condition.

    11.    The tribunal finds that the onwards appeal has no substance  and
         that there was no material error of law in the decision challenged.
         The judge's best interests assessment as required under section  55
         of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act  2009  was  carried
         out thoroughly and ample reasons were  given  for  the  conclusions
         reached.  None of the minor children included in the  evidence  for
         the  appeal  would  be   leaving   their   homes   or   educational
         environments, where they received full support.   All would have to
         come to terms with change in any event.  There were  as  the  judge
         properly found no exceptional circumstances.

    12.    The Appellant and her husband (whose children  are  all  adults)
         have several reasonable options open to them for  the  continuation
         of their family life, i.e., to  live  together  in  Jamaica  or  to
         travel there together on a visit while entry clearance is sought or
         to separate on a temporary basis while the Appellant obtains  entry
         clearance on the terms prescribed by the Immigration Rules.


    DECISION


    The appeal is dismissed


    The making of the previous decision did not involve  the  making  of  a
    material error on a point of law.  The decision stands unchanged.
