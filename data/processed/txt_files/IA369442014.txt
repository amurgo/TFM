Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr S. Khalid, Lords Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr D Clarke, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is an appeal by Mr Muhammad Tahseen against the decision of the
       First-tier Tribunal dismissing his appeal against  the  respondent's
       decision to refuse his application for leave to remain in the UK  as
       an entrepreneur under the Points Based System and to remove him from
       the  UK  by  way  of  directions  pursuant  to  section  47  of  the
       Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.


    2. Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules
       2008 (SI 2008/269) I do not make an anonymity order.  No  order  was
       made by the First-tier Tribunal and there were no issues  before  me
       that might require such an order.


    Background


    3. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 3 December 1982.  The
       respondent's refusal letter  dated  8  September  2014  refused  the
       application on the grounds that under paragraph 41SD(e)(iv) to  show
       that the business was trading the appellant was required to provide,
       amongst other things, a contract  that  showed  its  duration.   The
       respondent did not accept either of the two contracts provided as it
       was not accepted that they showed the duration of the  contracts  as
       required.


    4. The appeal  came  before  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Parkes  on  4
       December 2014 who  upheld  the  respondent's  conclusions  that  the
       appellant  had  failed  to  provide  appropriate  contracts  in  the
       specified form relating to the appellant's business.


    5. Permission to appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal  was  granted  on  all
       grounds: ground (1) being that  the  case  of  Shebl  (Entrepreneur:
       proof of contracts) [2014] UKUT 216, was  not  properly  applied  in
       deciding this issue as scope should have been given as  to  how  the
       'duration' of the contract was established depending on the type  of
       business; and ground (2) that as an  alternative  to  contracts  the
       Rules at paragraph 41-SD(e)(iv)(2)  allows  for  the  submission  of
       letters from UK regulated financial institutions,  alternatively  to
       the provisions of contracts, and that evidence which fulfilled  that
       requirement had not been considered.


    Ground 1


    6. The judge made findings in relation to both contracts  submitted  by
       the appellant.  At paragraph  7  the  judge  noted  that  the  Swiis
       contract termination clause on page 3 sets out  that  'either  party
       shall have the right at any  time  to  terminate  this  contract  by
       giving formal agreement after meeting  with  the  supervisor/Client.
       Termination should be confirmed in writing by both parties' and that
       the Core contract termination clauses were found at pages 9 and  10.
       Judge Parkes states that so far as the appellant's  obligations  are
       concerned  there  is  no  time  specified  for  giving   notice   of
       termination and each assessment and  report  to  be  provided  is  a
       separate contract.  Judge Parkes went on to find that:


       'the contracts do not state that there is any duration to  the  main
       contract and there is no mechanism within the terms  to  state  what
       notice period is required'.


    7. Mr Khalid argued that the parties  had  discussed  duration  in  the
       contracts including commencement and termination.


    8. The ordinary meaning of the word 'duration' is 'the length  of  time
       for which something continues'.  The duration of both  contracts  is
       not fixed but  it  is  clear  from  the  Swiis  contract  that  both
       commencement and termination were discussed  by  the  parties.   The
       Swiis contract allows termination to be  'confirmed  in  writing  by
       both parties' and that the client has additional rights in  relation
       to terminating the contract in the event of certain actions  by  the
       contractor.


    9. The Core contract contains the termination clauses  at  paragraph  6
       and 7 (and not 9 and 10 as indicated by  the  First-tier  Tribunal).
       The contract refers also to 'case contracts' which is defined  as  a
       'relevant Case Contract to be entered into between the parties'.  In
       relation to payment it is indicated  that  the  agreed  fee  is  the
       'consultancy fee (1700) which 'means  the  fee  agreed  between  the
       company and the  ISW  (independent  social  worker)  for  each  Case
       Contact as appropriate.  The contract goes on to state that the  due
       date for payment is 'the date referred to in the Case Contract which
       will be issued with each case accepted'.


   10.  Although therefore the Core contract deals with termination,  there
       is again reference to not  accepting  'further  contracts'  and  the
       completion of 'all existing Case Contracts'.   In  relation  to  the
       duration of the Core contract it is clear that it is not possible to
       determine this without reference to separate 'Case  Contracts'  with
       the fee and due date for payment and therefore  implicitly  the  end
       point for each Case Contract, being set out in each  Case  Contract.
       The judge was therefore correct to find, in  relation  to  the  Core
       Contract  that  the  Core  Contract  does  not  meet  the   relevant
       requirements.  Although Mr Khalid relied on Shebl (above)  I  am  of
       the view that Shebl does not assist the appellant, in this regard.


   11. The headnote of Shebl states as follows:


           'the requirement  to  prove  the  existence  of  'contracts'  in
           paragraph 41-SD of Appendix A of the immigration rules does  not
           itself require the contracts in question  to  the  contained  in
           document.  There is however, a need for  such  contracts  to  be
           evidenced in documentary form.'


       And at paragraph 5:


           '...The intention behind the Rules is that the claimant be  able
           to show  that  he  is  genuinely  trading.   It  strikes  us  as
           inconceivable that the entrepreneur route was to be confined  to
           the types of trading in  which  contracts  are  made  by  single
           documents.  Paragraph 41-SD very properly specifies  that  there
           must  be  documentary  evidence  sufficient  to   show   genuine
           contracts, and containing sufficient documentary information  to
           enable the Secretary of State to check the matter with the other
           parties for the contracts if she chooses to do so.'

   12. Although therefore as Mr  Khalid  emphasised  at  the  hearing,  the
       contract does not need to be in one document, it  was  made  equally
       clear in Shebl that 'there is  a  need  for  such  contracts  to  be
       evidenced in documentary form'.  It is clear that although read with
       the Case Contracts it may be possible to determine the  duration  of
       the contracts in the case of the Core contract, these do not  appear
       to have been produced and the judge therefore  was  correct  in  his
       findings.


   13. In relation to the Swiis  contract  however  the  contract  is  more
       specific, with specific reference to commencement date and there  is
       no reference to any separate  contracts.   It  is  stated  that  the
       contractor will be paid �200  a  day  for  training  and  �1500  for
       representation to panel.  The contract also indicates that  'in  the
       event that there are periods when there  are  no  Services  for  the
       Contractor to perform, the Contractor shall not be paid  a  retainer
       for these periods'.  The contact has therefore addressed  what  will
       happen during the lifetime of the contract including  periods  where
       no services and  therefore  no  fee  is  payable.   In  relation  to
       termination as noted above either party has the right  to  terminate
       the contract.  The fact that there is no notice  period  stated  for
       that termination does not invalidate the fact that  termination  has
       been specifically addressed.


   14. Mr Clarke did  not  point  to  any  legal  requirements  that  might
       indicate that duration could not be open-ended in the way  envisaged
       in the Swiis contract and the immigration  rules  do  not  prescribe
       that the contract must set out specific start and end dates.


   15. I do therefore find that the judge made an error of law in  relation
       to the Swiis contract.  Although there was no error in  relation  to
       the Core contact for the reasons set out above, as  paragraph  41-SD
       requires only 'one or more' of a contract for service, therefore the
       error is material and the appellant's appeal  can  succeed  on  this
       basis alone.


    Ground 2

   16. I need not consider ground 2, as the appellant succeeds on ground 1.
       However if it did not I consider  these  grounds  to  be  less  than
       persuasive.  It is clear that in the  alternative  to  one  or  more
       contract for service the  applicant  has  the  option  of  providing
       evidence from their bank.  Although  Mr  Khalid  relied  on  a  bank
       statement, paragraph 41-SD(e)(iv)(2) provides as follows:


       41-SD(e)(iv)(2)
       'one  or  more  original   letters   from   UK-regulated   financial
       institutions with which the applicant has a business  bank  account,
       on the institution's headed paper, confirming the dates the business
       was trading during the period referred to at (iv) above'.


   17. This was the period from before 11 July 2014 'up to no earlier  than
       there months before the date of his  application.'   Although  there
       was no letter provided, Mr Khalid relied on a bank statement for  10
       June to 18 July 2014.  There were just two receipts to the  account,
       one for �500 which is a 'transfer from Tahseen M' and one a  'direct
       credit from Jay Fostering Ltd Ref:  Panel'  for  �127.25.   The  two
       payments are a road toll payment and  a  card  payment  at  motorway
       services.  Although Mr Khalid relied on this as  evidence  that  the
       appellant was trading in the relevant period and relied on the Shebl
       principle  as  discussed  above,  the  relevant   rule   has   other
       requirements for bank statements and I am satisfied  that  there  is
       force in the argument that the requirement specifically for a letter
       from the bank, is additional.  Even if it weren't I am not satisfied
       that the bank statement in question confirms 'the dates the business
       was trading' during the relevant periods.  The fact that there are a
       limited number of transactions shown does not in itself confirm that
       the business was trading.  Although there  is  one  receipt  from  a
       fostering company none of these details match any in  the  contracts
       provided.   I  am  not  satisfied  therefore  that   paragraph   41-
       SD(e)(iv)(2) is satisfied.  Therefore there was no material error of
       law in this regard.


   18. However, for the  reasons  set  out  above  the  appellant's  appeal
       succeeds on ground 1.


          Decision:

   19. The making of the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve
       the making of an error on a point of law and is  set  aside  in  its
       entirety. I remake the decision allowing the appellant's appeal  for
       the reasons set out above, as he meets the terms of the  immigration
       rules  including  specifically,  paragraph   41-SD(e)(iv)(1)(d)   of
       Appendix  A.
