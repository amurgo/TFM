                                  JUDGMENT

                          - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Mrs Justice Andrews:
     1.  The First Applicant seeks judicial review of the decision  of  the
        Respondent ("the SSHD") 11 September 2017 to refuse  to  grant  him
        indefinite leave to remain ("ILR") as a Tier I  (General)  Migrant,
        and the further decision made on 14 December 2017  to  uphold  that
        refusal following an administrative review. The applications of the
        Second and Third Applicants (his wife and child) as his  dependents
        were refused in line with his application. For ease of reference  I
        shall refer to the First Applicant as  "the  Applicant"  throughout
        this judgment.


        Factual Background


     2.  The Applicant first applied for leave to enter the UK  on  26  May
        2009. That  application  was  refused,  but  on  24  June  2009  an
        application was made by his wife for leave to enter  as  a  Tier  4
        (General) student migrant. That application was granted with  leave
        to enter valid until 28 May 2011, with the Applicant being  granted
        status as her dependent. They entered the UK on 4 August 2009.


     3.  On 8 March 2011 the Applicant applied for leave  to  remain  as  a
        Tier 1  (General)  Migrant.  In  support  of  that  application  he
        asserted that he earned �15,715.79 from  his  employment  by  Argos
        Home Group Ltd between 31 March 2010  and  28  February  2011.  Tax
        would have been deducted from  those  earnings  at  source  by  his
        employer, under the PAYE scheme.


     4.      He also claimed that between 6 February 2010 and  21  February
        2011 he had earned dividends in the sum of �50,400 from  a  company
        named Dharnath Ltd., of which he was a director. According  to  the
        Respondent's records he supplied supporting evidence in the form of
        a dividend  schedule,  dividend  vouchers  and  a  letter  from  an
        accountant, as well as secondary  evidence  in  the  form  of  bank
        statements. He was awarded 40 points under the points-based  system
        for the total previous earnings claimed,  of  which  the  dividends
        formed the greater part. Had the Applicant  relied  solely  on  his
        declared prior income from employment, he would not have  qualified
        for Tier 1 leave.


     5.       As  Mr  Thomas  Jackson,  a  Higher  Executive   Officer   in
        Immigration Enforcement employed within the Home Office as a Higher
        Intelligence Analyst, explains in his witness  statement  dated  25
        September 2017, which was  annexed  to  the  Respondent's  detailed
        Grounds of Defence in  this  case,  an  individual's  self-employed
        earnings could not be verified with HMRC at the time of his or  her
        initial Tier 1 application, because self-employed tax  returns  are
        not required to be submitted until a time well after the period  of
        earnings in question.


     6.  On 19 April 2011 the Applicant was granted leave to  remain  as  a
        Tier 1 (General) Migrant until 19 April 2013. The  Third  Applicant
        subsequently applied for leave to enter  the  UK  and  was  granted
        leave to enter from 21 March 2012 to 19 April 2013 in line with the
        Applicant's leave.


     7.      On 5 April 2013 the Applicant made a further  application  for
        leave to remain as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant, which was granted on
        17 May 2013. The Second and Third Applicants  were  dependent  upon
        this application and their leave  was  granted  in  line  with  the
        Applicant's. That leave was valid until 17 May 2016.


     8.  On 12 November 2013 the Applicant filed a tax return for  the  tax
        year 2012-2013. He filed a tax return for the tax year 2013-2014 on
        30 March 2015, and for 2014-2015 on 22 January 2016. The tax return
        for 2013-2014 was submitted late and he received a �100  fine.  All
        these  returns  were  submitted  by  him  personally  and  not   by
        accountants on his behalf.


     9.  In the meantime, the Home Office  became  aware  that  there  were
        widespread abuses of the Tier 1 route. One  common  trend  was  for
        applicants  who  had  insufficient  earnings  from  employment   to
        qualify, to claim that they  had  additional  earnings  from  self-
        employed work in order to score enough points.  Such  claims  would
        typically  be  supported  by  evidence  of  bank  transactions  and
        invoices which appeared on their face to be genuine. In consequence
        of  this,  it  was  decided  in  December  2014  that   Immigration
        Intelligence Analysis would share data with HMRC on all persons who
        had extant leave to remain in the UK as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant,
        in accordance with s.29 of the Data Protection Act 1998.


    10. HMRC matched the data  supplied  with  their  tax  records  and  in
        January 2015 returned a spreadsheet which contained details of  all
        the relevant tax information relating  to  such  persons  that  was
        identified on their systems. This set out the person's total income
        from all sources, PAYE salary declared on their tax return,  income
        from PAYE  employers,  income  from  UK  company  dividends,  self-
        employment  net  income,  self-employment  net  profit  and   self-
        employment turnover. Those figures were up to date  as  at  January
        2015, and of course could not take  into  account  any  information
        submitted by the individual subsequently, including any  subsequent
        amendments made to earlier tax returns.


    11. In consequence of this exercise, the Respondent ascertained that by
        January 2015, the Applicant had not filed a tax return for the  tax
        year 2010-2011 in which he  had  supposedly  received  the  alleged
        dividend income of �50,400 declared on his Tier 1 application.


    12. The evidence of Ian Richard Lewis, an officer from HMRC, concerning
        HMRC's records specifically pertaining to the Applicant,  indicates
        that for the tax year 2010-2011 the  PAYE  records  concerning  the
        Applicant's employment with Argos Ltd indicated a gross  income  of
        �15,485.25. During the tax years  2012-2013,  2013-2014  and  2014-
        2015, when he had worked for three different  employers,  his  PAYE
        earnings were largely as per the tax returns, though some  earnings
        from Royal Mail Group Plc apparently did  not  appear  on  his  tax
        return for 2013-2014. His PAYE earnings in 2015-2016  when  he  was
        working for a company called Heathcotes M Ltd  were  in  accordance
        with his tax return.


    13. During the period from 2012 to 2015 the Applicant declared to  HMRC
        net profits from self-employment in a  business  named  Advise  for
        Investment in Property in India, in  the  region  of  �10,300  each
        year.  For the tax  year  2015-2016  he  declared  net  profits  of
        �39,799 from a different business named Retail Online Trade  Health
        Supplement.


    14.  The Applicant accepts that he did not file a tax  return  for  the
        tax year 2010-2011 until 5 March 2016.


    15.  On 18 May 2016 the  Applicant  made  an  in-time  application  for
        indefinite leave to remain as a Tier I (General) Migrant, with  the
        Second and Third Applicants as his dependents.


    16.  On  2  March  2017  the  Respondent  sent  the  Applicant  a   tax
        questionnaire  to  fill  in.   The  covering  letter  itemised  the
        documents required, but it then stated as follows:
          "this  information  is  being  requested  in  line  with  guidance
          provided by the HMRC website  on  what  records  a  self-employed
          individual should retain and for how long. It states that records
          should be kept "for at least five years from 31 January following
          the tax year that the tax return relates to..."


    17. The questionnaire itself asked, in Question 2, for confirmation  of
        "the financial years in which you were registered as  self-employed
        or as the director of  a  limited  company  in  the  UK"  [emphasis
        added]. Question 5 asked, "for the financial year(s) stated in your
        answer to question 2 in which you have  been  registered  as  self-
        employed or as the director of a limited company in the UK,  please
        confirm your turnover, net profit, gross profit and  expenses?"  On
        the face of the questionnaire  itself,  there  was  no  time  limit
        placed on the information requested.


    18. A completed questionnaire was initially submitted by the  Applicant
        on 17 May 2017. In it, he supplied the requested  details  for  the
        tax years from 2012-13 onwards (save for 2016-17, for which  a  tax
        return had not yet been submitted).  He stated that  from  2012  to
        2015 he was working as an overseas property consultant, and that in
        2015 he had started an online business selling health and  personal
        care and beauty products on Amazon. He answered all  the  questions
        relating to that business. In answer to  question  3,  which  asked
        whether a self-assessment tax return was submitted to HMRC  by  him
        or on his behalf for each of the  tax  years  referred  to  in  the
        answer to question 2, the Applicant stated that the tax returns for
        2012-2013 to 2014-2015 were "submitted by myself" but that  a  firm
        of accountants, which he named, submitted the return for 2015-2016.


    19. There was no mention in the  completed  questionnaire  of  the  tax
        returns for 2010-2011 or 2011-2012. Whereas that might have  seemed
        a surprising omission if the  questionnaire  were  to  be  read  in
        isolation, there is a potential explanation when it  is  considered
        in the light  of  the  covering  letter,  which  was  open  to  the
        interpretation  that  the  Home  Office  were  only  interested  in
        information covering the last five years, that  being  the  minimum
        period for which HMRC expect a self-employed trader to keep records
        relating to his business.


    20. However, even if there had been some initial confusion, six  months
        later, on 5  September  2017,  whilst  his  application  was  still
        pending, the Applicant submitted a revised set of  answers  to  the
        questionnaire. Since there is no evidence that this was prompted by
        any further  letter  from  the  Respondent,  it  appears  that  the
        Applicant must have belatedly realised that the information he  had
        given previously was incomplete.  The  answer  to  question  2  now
        stated he was a company director in 2010-2011  and  for  2011-2012,
        "not applicable as I was employed". The amplified  answer  to  that
        question referred to a gross dividend of �56,000 and a net dividend
        of �50,400 for the tax year 2010-2011. Those figures also appear in
        the answer to question 5. For 2011-2012 the Applicant stated:  "not
        active as company director but applied for self-employment."




    21. In answer to question  12  in  both  questionnaires  the  Applicant
        stated that he reviewed, checked and signed  all  his  tax  returns
        before they were submitted to HMRC. In answer to question 14, "have
        you ever needed to correct or resubmit your  tax  returns  for  the
        financial year(s) stated in your answer  to  question  2?"  in  the
        second questionnaire the Applicant stated "no, but 2010-2011 was  a
        late filing." That is the only mention of that tax return except in
        answer to question 10(a) in  which  he  states  that  all  his  tax
        returns  were  submitted  online  except  for   2010-2011   (manual
        submission).


    22. Although the Applicant plainly appreciated by September  2017  that
        the Respondent was interested in information pertaining to the 2010-
        2011 tax year and the dividend  income  allegedly  earned  in  that
        year, and that he should tell the Respondent that  the  tax  return
        for that year was filed late, he did not state how late it was, let
        alone proffer any explanation for the fact that it  was  not  filed
        until shortly before his application for ILR.


        The decision of 11 November 2017.


    23. The decision letter begins by setting out  the  requirements  under
        the Immigration Rules for an applicant to qualify for ILR as a Tier
        1 Migrant. The applicant must meet the  requirements  of  Paragraph
        245CD and (so far as earnings are concerned) paragraphs  19(i)  and
        19(j) of Appendix A of the Immigration Rules. Next, the  caseworker
        summarised the information supplied by the Applicant in response to
        the tax questionnaire in September 2017.


    24. The caseworker then refers to the fact that in the initial  Tier  1
        application the Applicant claimed �50,400 net dividend earnings for
        a period falling within the 2010-2011 tax year. The Respondent  had
        conducted further inquiries with HMRC whose records showed that  he
        did not initially submit a  tax  return  for  2010/2011,  therefore
        there was a difference of �50,400 dividend  earnings  between  what
        was claimed to the Home Office and what was initially  declared  to
        HMRC. It was noted that the Applicant had admitted  submitting  his
        tax return late but that he failed to give a reason for  this.  The
        letter continued:


        "This is not accepted. Having decided to work as  self-employed  in
        the United Kingdom it is your responsibility to ensure the  correct
        declaration of earnings are made  to  HMRC  at  the  correct  time,
        whether prepared by yourself or a third party. The onus is  on  you
        to ensure that the correct figures are submitted initially.  It  is
        not credible that you would not realise such  a  fundamental  error
        had been made in mis-declaring your income to HMRC until  nearly  5
        years  after  the  original  return  was  due  ...  your  lack   of
        explanation to account for the late submission is not accepted."


    25. The caseworker went  on  to  state  that  the  Respondent  was  not
        satisfied that the Applicant had been able to credibly account  for
        what the decision maker termed the "clear discrepancies between the
        above earnings that you have initially declared  to  HMRC  and  the
        earnings you had declared to [the Home Office]  for  your  previous
        immigration application". The decision letter pointed out  that  if
        the Applicant had  declared  earnings  in  line  with  his  initial
        earnings  declarations  to  HMRC,   i.e.   the   PAYE   income   of
        approximately �15,000, he would not have scored  sufficient  points
        under the Immigration Rules to qualify for leave  to  remain.  This
        led to two conclusions, namely:


           1) The Respondent was satisfied that the  Applicant  had  either
              misrepresented his earnings to HMRC in order  to  reduce  his
              tax  liability  or  provided  false  information  about   his
              earnings to the Home Office  in  order  to  obtain  leave  to
              remain "or both"; and


           2)     The tax discrepancies for 2010/2011 led the Respondent to
              question the credibility of the self-employed  earnings  that
              the Respondent had claimed in his subsequent applications for
              leave to remain and the Respondent was not satisfied  on  the
              balance  of  probability  that  the  self-employed   earnings
              claimed in his Tier 1 (General) Application were genuine.


        Pausing there, "or both" is an obvious error in  logic;      either
        the dividend figure declared to the Home  Office  was  genuine,  in
        which case material information was withheld from the  Revenue,  or
        it was not genuine and  there  was  nothing  to  declare  to  HMRC.
        However, that is not a material error, because it does not  detract
        from the substantive conclusion  that,  one  way  or  another,  the
        failure to declare the dividend figure to  HMRC  is  a  ground  for
        inferring an intention to deceive.


    26. The Respondent's primary reasons for  refusal  of  the  application
        were given under paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules,  which,
        so far as is relevant provides that leave to remain should normally
        be refused in the light of:


        "the undesirability of permitting the person concerned to remain in
        the  United  Kingdom  in  the  light  of  his  conduct   (including
        convictions  which  do  not  fall  within   paragraph   322(1)(C)),
        character or associations..."


        An application for ILR may be refused under paragraph 322(5)  as  a
        matter  of  discretion  irrespective  of  whether   the   applicant
        otherwise satisfies the requirements of the Tier 1 Rules.  As  with
        any other exercise of discretion, a decision made  under  paragraph
        322(5) is only susceptible of challenge on conventional public  law
        grounds.


    27. On behalf of the Applicant, Mr Turner contended that in the initial
        decision letter the caseworker was wrong to label this or treat  it
        as a case of "discrepancies" because this was not a case  in  which
        different figures were submitted to HMRC and the Home  Office,  but
        rather, there was no tax return submitted  to  HMRC  at  all  until
        several years later. That  seemed  to  me  to  be  an  exercise  in
        semantics. There is no distinction to be drawn between a  situation
        in which no income is declared to HMRC  from  a  particular  source
        when it should have been, and one in which less income is  declared
        to HMRC than should have been declared.  In  both  these  scenarios
        there is an inconsistency between what, if anything, HMRC has  been
        told, and what the Home Office was told.


    28. Unlike the case of R(Williams) v Secretary of State  for  the  Home
        Department (JR/10532/2017), a case on which Mr Turner relied, there
        was no fundamental misunderstanding of the facts. In that case  the
        applicant had failed to file tax returns for four  years,  but  the
        decision  maker  appeared  to  have  proceeded  on   an   incorrect
        assumption that he had declared different amounts of income to HMRC
        and the Home Office. In this case, HMRC did have information on the
        Applicant's earnings from employment through the  PAYE  system  for
        the tax year 2010-2011 and there was  a  discrepancy  between  that
        figure and the earnings he  declared  to  the  Respondent.  It  was
        obvious from reading the decision letter in the present  case  that
        the complaint was that the Applicant had not declared the 2010-2011
        dividend income to HMRC either when he should have done, or in  any
        successive tax return until he did so in March 2016,  and  that  on
        the face of it that led to one of two legitimate inferences: either
        the dividends were a fiction designed to deceive  the  Home  Office
        into granting leave when it was  initially  granted,  or  else  the
        Applicant was trying to avoid paying income tax  on  a  substantial
        sum of money.


    29. The decision letter went on to state that  the  Applicant  did  not
        meet the requirements listed under Paragraph 245CD  and  paragraphs
        19(i) and (j) of Appendix A because the  Respondent  could  not  be
        satisfied that the earnings of approximately �43,000 he had claimed
        for self-employment (from his new business) for the period  from  1
        June 2015 to 30  April  2016  were  genuine.  They  were  therefore
        discounted from the  points-based  assessment,  in  consequence  of
        which the Applicant was not able to demonstrate that he had  earned
        over �25,000 in the UK in the previous 12 months.


    30. Ms Idelbi very sensibly, and in my judgment rightly conceded, after
        taking instructions, that the decision could not be upheld on  that
        second ground. It is a huge leap in logic to infer from  a  finding
        that the dividends declared in 2010-2011 may have been  a  fiction,
        that the figures said to have been derived from self-employment  in
        a different business several years later were probably not genuine,
        especially when no attempt  was  made  by  the  decision  maker  to
        address the supporting documentation for that business supplied  by
        the Applicant, or the fact that for three years in the  intervening
        period his tax records from self-employment,  albeit  from  another
        business, had matched the declarations made to HMRC.


    31. Mr Turner submitted that once it was accepted that the decision  in
        respect of Paragraph 245CD and paragraphs 19(i) and (j) of Appendix
        A was one which no reasonable decision maker  could  have  reached,
        the decision as a whole must be  quashed.  He  contended  that  the
        concerns about the genuineness of the figures  in  respect  of  the
        later period could well have influenced  the  decision  made  under
        paragraph 322(5). However, it appears quite plain on  the  face  of
        the decision letter that the decision under  paragraph  322(5)  was
        what drove the decision in respect of paragraphs 19(i) and  (j)  of
        Appendix A, and not vice versa. Given that paragraph  322(5)  is  a
        stand-alone  ground  for  rejecting  the  application,  unless  the
        decision on that ground is also tainted by public  law  error,  the
        challenge must fail.


        The Administrative Review
    32. The Applicant sought an administrative review of the  decision.  In
        the reasons for reconsideration he  gave  an  explanation  both  as
        regards his failure to file the 2010-2011 tax return when  required
        and for the lengthy delay in filing it. As regards the  former,  he
        says that he had just started the business  and  was  not  familiar
        with the taxation system of the UK  as  he  "barely  lived  in  the
        country for nearly two years". He said he made  a  mistake  in  not
        filing   self-assessment   because   he   did   not   receive   any
        request/letter from HMRC, that this was  merely  human  error,  and
        that he had rectified the mistake and filed tax  returns  and  HMRC
        had accepted the correction and rectified their records.


    33. As far as the timing of the late submission of  his  2010-2011  tax
        return was concerned, the Appellant set out a litany  of  stressful
        incidents that had occurred in his life, beginning with his father-
        in-law suffering a "major heart stroke" some time  in  2011,  which
        led to his wife having to leave the UK immediately to see  to  him.
        He explained that after her return, he  and  his  wife  suffered  a
        series of family traumas, including a miscarriage which led to  his
        wife suffering from depression; she then underwent  serious  health
        complications with a further successful  pregnancy,  and  then  the
        baby turned out to suffer from severe eczema and food allergies. He
        said he could provide "all kind of evidence" for this.


    34. The Respondent did not ask the Appellant to provide such  evidence,
        but considered the points he had made in his administrative  review
        application,  and  decided  to  maintain  the  original   decision.
        Although it was  accepted  that  the  original  caseworker  made  a
        mistake in recording the figure for the  Applicant's  turnover  for
        the tax year 2015/2016, the reviewer decided that  the  application
        for ILR had been considered in accordance with the  correct  rules,
        policy and guidance and correctly assessed.


    35. As regards the explanation given for the late  filing  of  the  tax
        return, the reviewer did not query the  truthfulness  of  what  the
        Applicant had said about his father in law being unwell, his wife's
        miscarriage, the difficulties of her ensuing  pregnancy  and  their
        child being unwell, all of which events are sufficiently accurately
        summarised in the administrative review decision  letter.  However,
        the reviewer went on to point out that these issues arose over a 4-
        5 year period from 2011 onwards, during  which  the  Applicant  was
        able to submit other tax returns: "thus, it was not deemed that the
        issues raised would  halt  [the  Applicant]  submitting  [his]  tax
        returns".


    36.  Although  the  Applicant's  claims  to  have   made   a   positive
        contribution to the UK and to have always tried to be  honest  with
        the government were acknowledged, the  reviewer  pointed  out  that
        there were concerns regarding the Applicant's character and conduct
        in relation to his  dealings  with  other  government  departments.
        Whilst the Applicant claimed that there had been  no  loss  to  the
        exchequer, it was concerning that he failed to submit his  earnings
        for the period in question until the date he did,  especially  when
        he had  submitted  tax  returns  in  the  interim.  Those  concerns
        remained, despite HMRC's acceptance of the amendments.


    37. As for the excuse given by the Applicant for  not  filing  the  tax
        return when it should have been filed,  the  reviewer  pointed  out
        that it was the applicant's responsibility  to  make  sure  he  was
        aware of the law and requirements surrounding  self-employment,  if
        that was the employment he wished to take in the UK.  It  was  also
        his responsibility to ensure that  he  submitted  his  tax  returns
        accurately and in a timely manner.


        The claim for judicial review


    38. In his skeleton argument Mr Turner sought to make submissions based
        on Article 8 ECHR  and  an  alleged  failure  to  provide  adequate
        reasons for the impugned decision, which were  not  raised  in  the
        Statement of Facts and Grounds and for  which  permission  had  not
        been sought. Unsurprisingly Ms Idelbi, on behalf of the Respondent,
        took objection to this, but even if she had not done  so,  I  would
        have refused to consider any new grounds raised in  this  irregular
        manner at the last minute.


    39. I made it clear at the hearing that it  is  just  as  important  to
        adhere to the procedural requirements in this Tribunal as it is  in
        the  Administrative  Court.  This  Tribunal  will   not   entertain
        submissions on grounds which have not been properly raised  in  the
        claim or for which permission has neither been sought nor  granted.
        It is impermissible  for  counsel  to  seek  to  treat  a  skeleton
        argument as a substitute for making an  application  to  amend  the
        Statement of Facts and Grounds and  to  seek  permission  to  bring
        judicial review on those grounds if his client wishes  to  raise  a
        new point. It is no answer  to  this  objection  to  say  that  the
        Respondent will not be prejudiced or  that  the  new  grounds  only
        raise points  of  law.  Anything  that  amounts  to  a  substantive
        addition to the existing Grounds  for  which  permission  has  been
        granted is properly the subject of an amendment, and the Respondent
        is entitled to have advance notice of the  proposed  amendment,  to
        decide whether to oppose it, and to respond to it.


    40. The attempt to bypass the necessary formalities was  all  the  more
        egregious in this case, where permission to  bring  the  claim  for
        judicial review was granted following a renewed oral hearing  on  4
        September 2018. There was more than sufficient opportunity to  have
        asked for permission to  raise  fresh  grounds  on  that  occasion,
        instead of including them for the first time in a skeleton argument
        filed and served only three working days prior to  the  substantive
        hearing and even then,  not  asking  for  permission  to  amend.  I
        therefore refused to hear argument  on  any  matter  that  was  not
        already included in the claim for judicial review.


    41. Turning to those grounds, Mr  Turner  submitted  that  the  initial
        decision  under  paragraph  322(5)  was   tainted   by   procedural
        unfairness which was not cured by the  decision  on  administrative
        review. If the Respondent was going to draw  an  adverse  inference
        regarding the Applicant's character  from  the  fact  that  he  had
        failed to declare the dividend earnings in  excess  of  �50,000  to
        HMRC by 31 January 2012, the latest date for filing  his  2010-2011
        tax return, he should have been afforded the opportunity to explain
        why that happened and why the tax return  was  submitted  so  late,
        because there could be an innocent explanation.


    42. What happened afterwards was no answer to that  objection,  because
        (a) it is trite law that the decision  must  be  evaluated  on  the
        basis of the information that the decision maker had before him  at
        the time, (b) there  was  insufficient  room  on  the  form  to  be
        submitted in support of the request for an  administrative  review,
        to enable the applicant to provide a full explanation and (c) under
        the rules relating to administrative review, further evidence  will
        not be accepted in support of such a  request  in  a  case  decided
        under Paragraph 322(5).


    43. Mr Turner also  submitted  that  the  November  2017  decision  was
        Wednesbury unreasonable. The Respondent had failed to  satisfy  the
        burden of proof of dishonesty as set out in  Shen  (Paper  appeals;
        proving dishonesty) [2014] UKUT 236. In particular,  he  submitted,
        there had been no consideration of the Applicant's state  of  mind.
        There was also a failure to weigh in  the  balance  the  fact  that
        accurate tax returns had  been  submitted  during  the  intervening
        years, which he submitted weighed against any suggestion that there
        had been a deliberate attempt to deceive HMRC. However, the refusal
        was made under s.322(5) which does not  require  dishonesty  to  be
        established, but merely that  the  presence  of  the  applicant  is
        undesirable by reason of his  character  or  conduct.  There  is  a
        separate rule which applies to dishonesty, Paragraph 322(1A).


    44. Mr Turner referred  to  the  useful  guidance  provided  by  Martin
        Spencer J in the recent decision of R(Shahbaz Khan) v Secretary  of
        State for the Home Department (JR/3097/2017) which was also a claim
        for judicial review of a decision made under paragraph 322(5). Five
        undisputed propositions of law were set out at paragraph  27.  They
        can be summarised as follows:


          i) The question whether an applicant's  character  or  conduct  is
             questionable for the purposes of paragraph  322(5)  is  one  of
             fact for the Secretary of  State  to  determine,  and  is  only
             susceptible of challenge on conventional public law grounds;
         ii) The legality of that decision must be assessed by reference  to
             the material that was before the  decision  maker  and  not  to
             material produced later;
        iii) The Secretary of State is entitled  to  refuse  an  application
             under paragraph 322(5) if  he  rationally  concludes  that  the
             applicant has not been  completely  honest  or  transparent  in
             relation to his income either with  the  Home  Office  or  with
             HMRC;
         iv) An application may be refused on those grounds even if HMRC has
             taken no action against the applicant;
          v) It is not a defence for the applicant to blame  his  accountant
             or  agent  for  the  discrepancies  because  the  applicant  is
             personally responsible for his tax matters  and  dealings  with
             HMRC. (Indeed, in the course of his decision in Khan the  judge
             referred to numerous prior decisions of this tribunal in  which
             attempts by applicants to blame their  accountants  for  errors
             and omissions in  their  dealings  with  HMRC  were  rationally
             rejected by the Secretary of State, and  those  decisions  were
             upheld after challenge).


    45. To this list a sixth proposition can be  added,  namely,  that  the
        Secretary of State is  entitled  to  refuse  an  application  under
        paragraph 322(5) even if HMRC has decided not to  take  any  action
        against the individual and there has been no criminal prosecution.


    46. At the end  of  his  decision,  Martin  Spencer  J  gave  extremely
        valuable guidance as to the approach to be adopted by the Secretary
        of State in cases where there is a difference between  the  figures
        submitted to the Home Office  and  the  figures  submitted  to  the
        Inland Revenue. He said that where there is no plausible reason for
        the difference, the Respondent  is  entitled  to  draw  an  adverse
        inference against the Applicant; but where evidence is provided  to
        explain the difference, the  Respondent  must  engage  in  a  fact-
        finding exercise to determine whether the prima facie evidence of a
        lack of honesty or transparency in the individual's  dealings  with
        HMRC or the Home Office has been displaced.


    47. In so doing, the Respondent should remind himself of  the  relevant
        standard of proof (the balance of probabilities)  but  should  also
        remind himself of the consequences of a finding of dishonesty,  see
        R (Giri) v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2015]  EWCA
        Civ 784. Blaming an  accountant  or  shutting  one's  eyes  to  the
        difference or problem will not suffice to  displace  a  finding  of
        dishonesty, but if there is an issue as to whether  the  individual
        was careless or dishonest, the onus is on the Respondent to provide
        sufficient reasons for disbelieving him; and he must  consider  the
        evidence pointing in both directions before reaching a  conclusion.
        That consideration involves an evaluation of  the  plausibility  of
        the explanation provided, why  the  individual  did  not  spot  the
        mistake, if there was one, what if any  steps  had  been  taken  to
        remedy the situation, and whether any  relevant  documentation  had
        been disclosed or an explanation provided for its absence.


    48. In my judgment what Martin Spencer J said in that  case  about  the
        approach to be adopted where  there  are  differences  between  the
        figures in the tax return and the application to the  Home  Office,
        applies with equal force to a situation in which the applicant  has
        failed to file a tax return or tax returns, either for  a  specific
        year or for a longer period. However, nothing in that case supports
        the proposition that it is incumbent upon the  Respondent  to  call
        for evidence from an applicant to  rebut  a  prima  facie  case  of
        dishonesty or attempted deception. On the contrary, Martin  Spencer
        J said in terms that where there is no  plausible  reason  for  the
        difference in the figures submitted to HMRC and to the  Respondent,
        the Respondent is entitled to draw an adverse inference.


    49. In Khan the judge was dealing with a case in  which  the  applicant
        had provided an explanation for  the  discrepancies,  supported  by
        evidence from the applicant's accountants.  He  therefore  did  not
        have to consider the question which arises  in  the  present  case,
        namely, whether it is incumbent on the applicant  to  volunteer  an
        explanation, or  whether,  if  in  theory  the  possibility  of  an
        innocent explanation exists, but none is provided,  the  Respondent
        must ask for an explanation from the applicant before  reaching  an
        adverse conclusion.


    50. Mr Turner submitted that the common law duty of procedural fairness
        required the Respondent to give  the  Applicant  in  this  case  an
        opportunity to explain his failure to file the relevant tax  return
        until 2016 before reaching the conclusion  that  this  conduct  was
        deliberate or reckless, rather than simply careless.


    51. Ms Idelbi referred me to several fact-specific  decisions  of  this
        Tribunal in which adverse decisions made by  the  Respondent  under
        paragraph 322(5)  in  similar  types  of  case  have  been  upheld.
        However, in all those cases, as in Khan,  the  applicant  or  their
        legal  representatives   provided   an   explanation   with   their
        application for leave to remain, sometimes supported  by  a  letter
        from the applicant's accountants accepting that they were at fault.
        In that context, arguments that the  individuals  concerned  should
        have been interviewed or given the opportunity to  provide  further
        information or evidence were given short shrift, albeit that it was
        accepted in at least one of those cases that it  was  incumbent  on
        the  Respondent  to  consider  whether  there   was   an   innocent
        explanation before making a final decision.


    52. This case is slightly different. On the face  of  it,  the  greater
        part of the income on which the applicant had relied in support  of
        his initial application as a Tier 1 migrant had not  been  declared
        to HMRC until over four years had elapsed since it should have been
        declared; it was then declared to HMRC only two months  before  the
        application for ILR. As Ms Idelbi pointed out, the tax  return  for
        2010-2011 was not filed at the same time as the tax return for 2014-
        2015, nor was it filed at or close to either of the usual deadlines
        for filing tax returns (the end of October for  paper  returns  and
        end of January for online returns).


    53.  The  Applicant  had  filed  self-employed  tax  returns  for   all
        subsequent years in which he was running his own  business,  albeit
        that one of them was filed slightly late. If the failure to file  a
        tax return in  2010-2011  had  been  an  oversight,  or  due  to  a
        misunderstanding of or ignorance  of  the  tax  system,  one  would
        expect him  to  have  thought  about  the  dividends  when  he  was
        preparing one of those returns, and rectified the situation then.


    54. It is not as if the amount involved was small. The  amount  of  the
        alleged dividend income was over �50,000, which is a lot  of  money
        by any standards, but particularly if the source  was  said  to  be
        dividends declared by a company  of  which  the  Applicant  was  an
        active director. To put this  into  perspective,  that  figure  was
        around five times as much as the net profits declared annually from
        the applicant's online property business. The net profits after tax
        of Dharnath Ltd would have to have been substantial to enable it to
        declare dividends of that  magnitude.  That  figure  made  all  the
        difference to the success of the initial Tier  1  application,  and
        against the known background of widespread abuses  of  the  Tier  1
        system, the failure by the Applicant to declare it  to  HMRC  until
        March 2016 was enough to raise an adverse inference in the  absence
        of any plausible explanation.


    55. However,  no  explanation  was  proffered  by  the  Applicant,  and
        although he had volunteered that his tax return for  2010-2011  had
        been submitted late, he did not say how late.  He  must  have  been
        aware that if he had revealed the timing, it would have been likely
        to raise additional grounds for concern. Of course,  he  would  not
        have known that the Respondent's background checks with HMRC  would
        already have revealed that no tax return for  that  year  had  been
        filed by January 2015.


    56. Ms Idelbi submitted that the public law duty of  fairness  did  not
        require  the  Respondent  to  afford  the   Applicant   a   further
        opportunity to provide an explanation  before  drawing  an  adverse
        inference from a prima facie case  of  dishonesty.  She  relied  on
        EK(Ivory Coast) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2014]
        EWCA Civ 1517. That was a case in which the Court of Appeal decided
        that the public  law  duty  to  act  fairly  did  not  require  the
        Respondent to postpone making a decision  on  an  application  made
        under the Tier 4 points-based system to enable a student, whose CAS
        certificate had been withdrawn through no  fault  of  her  own  and
        without her knowledge, to obtain another sponsor. It held that  the
        Secretary of State was not responsible for any unfairness  suffered
        by the applicant in that case, which was caused by the behaviour of
        her sponsor, and that in a case of that nature the duty of fairness
        should not result in the public benefits associated with  having  a
        clear and  predictable  scheme  operating  according  to  objective
        criteria being placed in serious jeopardy.


    57. The difference between that situation and the present, however,  is
        that the relevant ground of refusal was not one of failure to  meet
        any of the criteria for the award of points under the  points-based
        system. Giving someone an opportunity to  rectify  the  absence  of
        evidence establishing  that  the  criteria  are  met,  when  it  is
        incumbent on that person  to  demonstrate  that  they  satisfy  the
        criteria, would plainly cause  unwarranted  delays  and  upset  the
        operation of the system. Although the  Tier  1  system  is  points-
        based, and EK would preclude an applicant from complaining that  he
        had not been  afforded  extra  time  to  provide  evidence  of  the
        satisfaction of one or more of the underlying  criteria  for  which
        points  are   awarded,   paragraph   322(5)   is   an   overarching
        discretionary  ground  for  refusal   which   could   be   deployed
        irrespective of whether the applicant was able to  demonstrate  the
        accumulation of sufficient points to  qualify  for  ILR.  Moreover,
        unlike EK, a case such as this depends on a finding of questionable
        conduct on the part of the applicant, in this  case  deliberate  or
        reckless  conduct,  as  opposed  to   carelessness   or   excusable
        oversight. Therefore, I am not persuaded that the decision in EK is
        directly pertinent.


    58. None of the previous decided cases on paragraph 322(5) to  which  I
        was referred addressed the situation in which  no  explanation  was
        initially  provided  by  the  applicant.  Whilst  the   instinctive
        reaction is that someone should be given the opportunity to rebut a
        prima facie case of dishonesty, (unless the situation is so  clear-
        cut that no innocent explanation could possibly be given  for  it),
        there  can  be  no  justification  for  treating  someone  who  has
        volunteered an explanation differently  from,  or  less  favourably
        than, someone who chooses not to do so. Otherwise applicants  would
        be encouraged to stay silent, so that they might then  complain  of
        procedural unfairness if  an  adverse  decision  was  made  in  the
        absence of an explanation.


    59. Mr Turner was unable to demonstrate why someone like the Applicant,
        who could give an  explanation  but  fails  to  do  so  before  the
        decision  is  made,  should  be  afforded  any  greater  procedural
        protection than  someone  who  provides  an  explanation  which  he
        belatedly seeks to amplify, or which he contends might be  believed
        if he were interviewed.


    60. As Khan establishes,  if  an  explanation  is  given,  it  must  be
        considered, and considered fairly, but the duty  of  fairness  does
        not require the Respondent to ask  the  person  concerned  for  any
        further information or evidence in  support  of  that  explanation.
        That indicates that it is incumbent on the individual concerned  to
        provide the Respondent with  all  the  information  and  supporting
        evidence  on  which  he  or  she  relies  to  provide  an  innocent
        explanation  for  what  would  or  might  otherwise  be  viewed  as
        questionable conduct reflecting adversely on their  character,  and
        that there is only one chance to do so. Logically it  follows  that
        if something is not  mentioned  at  the  time  the  application  is
        considered, the duty of fairness does not require the Respondent to
        give further time to the applicant to  provide  it.  A  person  who
        fails to provide any explanation at all should be in  no  different
        or better position than a  person  who  fails  to  provide  a  full
        explanation.


    61. Ms Idelbi submitted that in any event, the  Respondent  did  afford
        the Applicant a  sufficient  opportunity  to  provide  an  innocent
        explanation at the time  of  submitting  the  answers  to  the  tax
        questionnaire, which he had submitted  not  once,  but  twice.  The
        questionnaire, and the covering letter from the Respondent, made it
        plain that the Respondent was interested  in  establishing  if  the
        declared earnings were genuine or not,  since  that  was  the  main
        reason given for asking all these questions.  It  would  have  been
        plain to the reader that the Home Office was  going  to  carry  out
        checks with HMRC to ascertain if the information  provided  tallied
        with their records.


    62. I can understand how the  covering  letter  may  have  led  to  the
        questionnaire being interpreted as seeking information  only  about
        the last five years for which tax returns were lodged. However,  by
        September 2017, at the latest, the Applicant  appreciated  that  it
        was incumbent on him to provide information in respect of 2010-2011
        and 2011-2012 as well as for the five tax years he had addressed in
        his  initial  answers.  He  also  obviously  appreciated  that  the
        Respondent should be told that his tax  return  for  2010-2011  was
        filed later than it should have been. Yet despite that appreciation
        he failed to explain that it was filed more than four  years  after
        it should have been, or why that happened. (Indeed, the failure  to
        mention how late it was filed could signify an appreciation that he
        might face some difficulties if that  information  came  to  light,
        though that inference was not drawn by either of  the  Respondent's
        caseworkers).


    63. I have concluded that Ms Idelbi's analysis is correct  and  accords
        with the approach in Khan and other  cases.  There  was  sufficient
        information in the tax questionnaire and the covering letter to put
        the Applicant on notice, should that have been necessary,  that  if
        there was any irregularity or something  else  about  his  dealings
        with the Revenue that the Respondent might potentially hold against
        him, this was his chance to provide an explanation for it,  coupled
        with any supporting evidence on which he might wish  to  rely.  The
        tax  questionnaire  prompted  many  other  applicants  in   similar
        situations to volunteer explanations and evidence.


    64. This Applicant is supposed to be an experienced businessman and  he
        knew why it was that his 2010-2011 tax  return  was  not  submitted
        until March 2016. He had  engaged  accountants  to  assist  him  in
        submitting his latest tax return, so he had access to  professional
        advice. He knew the late filing of his  2010-2011  tax  return  was
        sufficiently  important  for  him  to  mention  it.  He   had   the
        opportunity to explain how that state of affairs  came  about.  The
        fact that he failed to provide that explanation is not the fault of
        the Secretary of State, and fairness did  not  require  him  to  be
        given another chance before the decision was made.


    65. Accordingly, when the caseworker who made the initial decision came
        to consider the application for ILR, there was  enough  information
        for him to  be  able  to  reach  a  rational  conclusion  that  the
        Applicant had not been honest or transparent in his  dealings  with
        HMRC or with the Home Office, and nothing had been provided by  the
        Applicant by way of explanation that might suggest that it would be
        wrong to draw that adverse inference. Indeed, the  absence  of  any
        innocent explanation when one might be expected to have been given,
        was a further factor to weigh in the balance against the  Applicant
        when exercising discretion under paragraph 322(5).


    66. I also reject Mr Turner's submission  that  the  Respondent  should
        have required the Applicant  to  undergo  an  interview.  There  is
        nothing in the authorities to support that submission. When I asked
        Mr Turner whether it was his contention that the Secretary of State
        should interview any applicant who was suspected  of  either  using
        dishonesty to obtain Tier 1 status or of having tried to cheat  the
        Revenue, he eschewed reliance on that as a general proposition, but
        then was unable to articulate what it  was  about  this  particular
        case that dictated a legal requirement for an interview. Whilst the
        Respondent always has the discretion  to  interview  an  applicant,
        there was no reason why that discretion should have been  exercised
        here.


    67. In my judgment, based upon the information that was before      the
        decision  maker  at  the  time,   the   original   decision   under
        paragraph 322(5) cannot possibly be described  as   irrational.  Mr
        Turner sought to argue that there was no consideration of the  fact
        that the Applicant's  tax  return  figures  for  the  self-employed
        business tallied with those in HMRC's records for subsequent years,
        which he contended was an indication of honest dealing, which might
        in turn support his client's contention that the initial failure to
        declare the dividends was  a  one-off,  honest  mistake.  The  fact
        remains, however, that the decision maker had no explanation of any
        kind from the Applicant for his failure to declare income in excess
        of �50,000 to HMRC for several years.


    68. That evidential gap could not be filled by  consideration  of  what
        the Applicant did or how he behaved in subsequent years. Indeed, on
        each subsequent occasion when he filed a tax return, he had  failed
        to avail himself of the opportunity to pay the tax he ought to have
        paid or to declare the income he ought to have declared for the tax
        year 2010-2011. Thus his failure to file the tax  return  in  2010-
        2011 is not a solitary aberration as Mr Turner submitted.


    69. In the absence of mistake or oversight being offered as an  excuse,
        the  Respondent  was  entitled  to  draw  an  inference  that   the
        Applicant's behaviour was deliberate. Therefore, the  challenge  to
        the initial decision both in terms of alleged procedural unfairness
        and on grounds of Wednesbury unreasonableness must fail.


    70. However, even if I am wrong about that, the Applicant  did  produce
        an explanation prior to the administrative review and it was not of
        a nature that would  have  taken  matters  any  further.  Although,
        strictly speaking, the validity of the  initial  decision  must  be
        considered in the light of the  information  that  was  before  the
        decision maker at the time, that explanation  was  not  ignored  on
        review. On the contrary, it was taken fully into consideration.


    71. Mr Turner submitted that the Applicant should  have  been  afforded
        the opportunity to submit the supporting evidence that he  said  he
        would have been able to produce regarding the many troubles he  and
        his family underwent in the period from 2011 onwards. However,  the
        reviewer did not challenge the veracity of what the Applicant  said
        about those stress factors, but instead implicitly proceeded on  an
        assumption in his favour that he was telling the truth about  those
        matters. The reviewer pointed out that despite those many stressful
        events, the Applicant was still able to file tax returns throughout
        that period (as well as running his own business and  holding  down
        jobs with  his  various  employers).  The  various  stress  factors
        therefore afforded no plausible explanation for his not filing  the
        2010-2011 tax return until March 2016, a very short time before  he
        made  his  application  for  ILR.  There  was  (and  still  is)  no
        explanation of when, and in what circumstances, it  dawned  on  the
        Applicant that he should file the missing tax return.


    72. The reviewer was also entitled to regard the explanation given  for
        failing to file  the  tax  return  in  the  relevant  tax  year  as
        insufficient to displace the initial  decision  maker's  legitimate
        concerns about the Applicant's conduct. As Ms Idelbi  pointed  out,
        when he  made  his  initial  application  for  Tier  1  leave,  the
        Applicant submitted a letter  from  his  accountant,  and  the  net
        figure he provided made allowance for the 10% tax that  would  have
        been accounted for at source. He was relying on  these  figures  as
        part of his personal income for the  purpose  of  the  points-based
        system. For all those reasons, his claim that he did not realise he
        had to file a tax return (and  by  implication,  that  he  did  not
        appreciate that there was a liability to pay income  tax  on  those
        dividends,  assuming  they  existed)  lacks  credibility  and   the
        Respondent was entitled to reject it.


    73. Therefore, if there had been  any  procedural  unfairness,  it  was
        cured. The review decision was also rational and took into  account
        the explanation in a manner that was fair and consistent  with  the
        guidance in Khan, albeit that that guidance  only  applies  to  the
        initial decision in circumstances where  an  explanation  has  been
        furnished, and not to a review. I  reject  Mr  Turner's  submission
        that the Applicant's explanation was not  properly  considered.  It
        plainly was. The reviewer was entitled, for  the  reasons  that  he
        gave, to conclude that the explanation was insufficient to displace
        the original conclusions rationally reached by the primary decision
        maker that  there  had  either  been  an  attempt  to  deceive  the
        Respondent by artificially inflating the income in order to  obtain
        leave under Tier 1, or an attempt to avoid payment of  tax  on  the
        dividends, if they existed. Both decision makers were  entitled  to
        draw those inferences from all  the  material  submitted,  and  the
        explanation belatedly provided  by  the  applicant,  taken  in  the
        round.


    74. Finally, judicial review is a  discretionary  remedy.  It  will  be
        refused if no purpose would be served by quashing the  decision  or
        decisions under challenge and remitting them to be re-made. In this
        case, it is at least highly likely, if not inevitable, that if  the
        Respondent  were  to  re-make  the  decision  on  the   Applicant's
        application for ILR, it would be refused, and  rationally  refused,
        under paragraph 322(5). Mr Turner submitted that the Tribunal could
        not make that assumption, because his client would have a chance to
        put in further evidence before the decision was re-made, but if and
        insofar as that evidence would relate to the various stress factors
        mentioned in the application to review, it would  take  matters  no
        further. The explanation the Applicant gave would not be  improved,
        nor could it be improved by further evidence.




      Conclusion


    75. For all these reasons, I refuse judicial review of the Respondent's
        decision and of the administrative review decision.
