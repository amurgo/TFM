Representation
For the Appellant:     Ms A. Fijiwala, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms M. Malhotra, counsel, instructed by Lawrence &
                    Associates

                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. I shall refer to the appellant as the secretary of state  and  to  the
      respondent as the claimant.

   2. The secretary of state appeals with permission against the decision of
      First-tier Tribunal Judge Abebrese allowing the claimant's appeal,  in
      a decision promulgated on 24 April 2018.

   3. The claimant is a national of Mauritius  born  on  22  July  1993.  He
      entered the UK on 24 June 2006 with leave to remain as a visitor valid
      for a period of six months. On 29 April 2009 he was granted leave as a
      dependent child until 26 June 2010. On 11 January 2011 he was  granted
      leave as a dependent child until 31 July 2011. On 18 November 2011  he
      was served with an IS 151 A.

   4. He has made a number of applications for leave to  remain.  He  became
      appeal rights exhausted on 21 January 2016. On  6  June  2016  he  was
      served with a RED.0001. On 27 October 2016  he  made  a  human  rights
      claim for leave to remain in the UK on the basis  of  his  established
      family and private life in the UK.

   5. Judge Abebrese found that the claimant had not  provided  evidence  to
      show that he can meet the requirements of  the  Immigration  Rules  in
      respect of family life as he had not provided evidence showing that he
      has a partner or child in the UK.

   6.  Nor  was  he  able  to  satisfy  the  requirements  under   paragraph
      276(1)(iii) of the Rules. He accepted that he has spent his  formative
      period in the country of his birth, Mauritius, and  is  aware  of  the
      culture and societal norms in that country.

   7. He would however require support in Mauritius  in  order  for  him  to
      settle and integrate based on the  psychological  report  provided  in
      support of his claim [19]. He accepted the conclusions of  the  report
      regarding the present medical condition of the claimant. On balance he
      was of the view that the claimant has provided evidence in support for
      his claim that he would face significant obstacles and that  he  would
      not be able to integrate on his return.  He found  that  he  therefore
      satisfies the requirements under paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) of the  Rules
      [19].

   8. Judge Abebrese considered the decision under Article 8  of  the  Human
      Rights Convention. He found that the decision  is  not  in  accordance
      with the law as it did not fully take into  account  the  relationship
      which  the  claimant  has  with  his  parents  and  sibling  and   the
      circumstances he would face on his return to Mauritius.

   9. He concluded that the decision to  remove  him  from  the  UK  is  not
      proportionate: He accepted the evidence of the claimant's  parents  as
      credible in respect of the claimant's ability to cope if  returned  to
      Mauritius [25].

  10. He accepted the conclusions of Ms Horton in her  Psychologist  report.
      He  accepted  that  the  claimant  is   suffering   from   significant
      psychological distress due to the impact of the residency  status  and
      that he has been experiencing low mood and high levels of anxiety.  He
      has also been experiencing isolation and suicidal moods [26].

  11. He accepted her diagnosis that the claimant  has  generalised  anxiety
      disorder which means that he is at risk of committing suicide  because
      of his situation. He also formed the view that the claimant would find
      it difficult to integrate if he were to be returned because his  close
      family are all in the UK and there is a lack of  evidence  as  to  the
      support he would receive  from  other  relatives  if  he  were  to  be
      returned [27].

  12.  He  concluded  that  the  decision  to  remove  him  would   in   the
      circumstances be disproportionate [28].

  13. On 8 August 2018, First-tier Tribunal Judge Alis granted the secretary
      of state permission to appeal: It was arguable that the Judge did  not
      fully engage with paragraph 18 of the refusal  letter,  especially  as
      his uncle remains in the family home in Mauritius. In considering  the
      appeal under Article 8, it is arguable that the Judge failed to engage
      with the principles of Ghising and Kugathas bearing in  mind  that  at
      the date of hearing, he was aged 24 ï¿½ years old.

  14. Ms Fijiwala relied on the grounds of appeal. In  allowing  the  appeal
      under the Rules and Article 8 outside the Rules,  Judge  Abebrese  did
      not engage with the refusal letter which clearly considered  the  2016
      report of Ms Horton. The secretary of state  also  took  into  account
      that the claimant had been in the UK without leave and his last  grant
      of leave was solely for him to complete his A levels.

  15. The secretary of state's reasons for refusing the application were not
      properly considered. Ms Fijiwala referred to [19] of the decision. The
      Judge found that the claimant had provided evidence that he would face
      "significant obstacles" under paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi)  of  the  Rules.
      However, the requirement under the Rules is that there must  be  "very
      significant obstacles" to his integration into Mauritius.   She  noted
      in particular, that the appellant had resided in Mauritius for over 13
      years prior to arriving in the UK. This included his formative years.

  16. Further, his uncle (his father's brother) resides in Mauritius and  he
      has inherited his parents' home. It is reasonable to  expect  that  he
      could provide the claimant with support and accommodation on return to
      Mauritius.

  17. She submitted that the secretary of  state  did  consider  the  social
      worker's report by Ms Horton dated 26 July 2016.  It  was  noted  that
      although they "referenced" medical sources in the report,  no  primary
      medical evidence was submitted directly to the Home Office.

  18. She submitted that the Judge did not consider at all the secretary  of
      state's consideration set out from paragraph 11 onwards in the reasons
      for refusal. The secretary of state  also  produced  evidence  in  the
      reasons for refusal that medical care and treatment  is  available  in
      Mauritius. That includes effective treatment available for those  with
      mental problems and suicidal inclinations.

  19. There are accordingly effective mechanisms in place for  reducing  the
      risk of suicide which would be available to the claimant in Mauritius.
      In addition, the secretary of state noted that adequate steps would be
      taken  in  the  UK  to  forestall  a  suicide  attempt.  The  claimant
      accordingly did not meet the requirements or threshold in the six part
      test in J v SSHD [2005] EWCA Civ 629 reaffirmed in Y and Another  (Sri
      Lanka) [2009] EWCA Civ 362.

  20. In accepting that the appellant is in a relationship with  his  mother
      and that he is dependent "on them" because of his  medical  condition,
      and that his return would not be in the  public  interest,  the  Judge
      gave no consideration  of  whether  this  was  more  than  the  normal
      emotional ties. There was  no  reference  to  any  dependency  in  the
      report. The appellant  asserted  in  his  witness  statement  that  he
      requires the emotional and practical support of his family on a  daily
      basis which he is dependent on.

  21. She submitted that in allowing the appeal under the Rules and  Article
      8 outside the Rules, there was no adequate reasoning  as  to  why  the
      appeal should be allowed. He did not give any reasons as  to  why  the
      claimant, who is no longer a minor and who spent his  formative  years
      in Mauritius, will face significant obstacles on return. Nor  did  the
      Judge adequately reason why his individual circumstances outweigh  the
      public interest.  In  particular  it  is  inadequate  just  simply  to
      acknowledge that his leave was precarious.

  22. On behalf of the claimant, Ms Malhotra,  who  did  not  represent  him
      before the First-tier Tribunal, referred to [14] of the  decision.  It
      is noted by the Judge that the claimant and his father were called  to
      give evidence and they both adopted their  witness  statements.  There
      was no cross-examination at all by the Home Office Presenting Officer.



  23. She also referred to paragraph 18 of the reasons  for  refusal.  There
      the respondent asserted that his uncle is in Mauritius.  He  would  be
      able to provide the claimant with support  and  accommodation  on  his
      return to Mauritius.

  24. The claimant in his witness statement stated that  he  does  not  have
      assets or accommodation in Mauritius. His uncle was not  mentioned  in
      the witness statement.

  25. This was also  asserted  by  the  claimant's  father  in  his  witness
      statement that they do not even have any accommodation  in  Mauritius.
      He is getting a great deal of support from  his  friends  and  family,
      something which is  absent  in  Mauritius  for  him.  If  returned  to
      Mauritius, there will be nowhere for him to stay.  He  fears  that  he
      will be homeless and destitute leaving him in a vulnerable position.

  26. There was no cross-examination of either the claimant or  his  father.
      It was not even put to him that he had an uncle who would be available
      to assist him in Mauritius.

  27. At [25] the Judge accepted the evidence of the claimant's  parents  as
      credible in respect of his ability to cope if he were to  be  returned
      to Mauritius. There  was  no  challenge  to  the  evidence  and  is  a
      perfectly sustainable finding. Accordingly, there was no challenge  to
      the claimant's assertion that he would be destitute on return.

  28. She submitted that ground 2 of the secretary  of  state's  application
      for permission, is informed by the first ground. It is  asserted  that
      the Judge did explain and give adequate reasons why the claimant  will
      face significant obstacles on return.

  29. Ms Malhotra submitted that the  Judge  was  considering  the  lack  of
      support that he  would  receive  from  relatives  if  he  were  to  be
      returned. He had proper regard to the  report  and  diagnosis  of  Mrs
      Horton. The references in the report to suicidal ideation was  clearly
      set out in the report. She had provided a detailed report relating  to
      the claimant's current emotional well being.

  30. She referred to the decision of the  Upper  Tribunal  in  Lama  (video
      recorded evidence - weight - Art 8 ECHR) [2017] UKUT  16  at  [31-32].
      The Tribunal considered the recent decision of the Court of Appeal  in
      PT (Sri Lanka) v ECO, Chennai [2016] EWCA Civ 612. The Court of Appeal
      reviewed the decision of the Court of Appeal in Kugathas v SSHD [2003]
      EWCA Civ 31 - the leading authority in this field -   which  concurred
      with the formulation of the Commission in S v UK [1984] DR 196:

           "Generally  the  protection  of  family  life  under  Article  8
           involves co-habiting  dependants,  such  as  parents  and  their
           dependent  minor  children.  Whether   it   extends   to   other
           relationships depends on the  circumstances  of  the  particular
           case" (emphasis in the original).

  31. Ms Malhotra finally submitted that there has also been no challenge of
      his prior medical problems.

  32. In reply, Ms  Fijiwala  submitted  that  the  Home  Office  Presenting
      Officer relied on the reasons for refusal. It  was  incumbent  on  the
      Judge to have regard to the decision.




      Assessment

  33. Both the claimant and his father gave evidence before  the  First-tier
      Tribunal. In his witness statement, the claimant  noted  that  he  had
      spent his formative  years  in  the  UK  and  had  developed  numerous
      friendships. He is no longer in  touch  with  friends  and  family  in
      Mauritius. He has spent nearly half his life in the UK. He has  always
      lived with his parents and brother. He has never lived on his own.

  34. He contended that on  account  of  his  mental  health  condition,  he
      requires the emotional and practical support of his family on a  daily
      basis which he is dependent on. The thought of  being  separated  from
      them is distressing and has pushed him to attempt suicide in the past.
      He will not get the emotional support that he  currently  receives  if
      forced to relocate to Mauritius.

  35. He stated at paragraph 7 of his statement,  that  notwithstanding  the
      Home Office contention  that  there  is  mental  health  treatment  in
      Mauritius, it was not appreciated that the support from his family  is
      a fundamental part  of  his  treatment  and  not  just  medication  or
      counselling.

  36. In the appellant's father's witness statement, he  also  set  out  the
      serious problems that the claimant would face if removed to Mauritius.



  37. The Home Office Presenting Officer did not  cross  examine  either  of
      them. Nor did he seek to join issue with  their  assertions  in  their
      respective witness statements, confirmed and repeated by them in their
      oral evidence.

  38. The Home Office Presenting Officer simply stated that  she  relied  on
      the contents of the refusal letter. The Judge recorded at at paragraph
      [15] that she stated  that  the  circumstances  of  the  claimant  had
      altered since the making of the decision "and she had nothing  further
      to add."

  39. The Judge went on to consider the report of Ms Horton. She produced  a
      report of some 18 pages. She has set out  in  detail  the  immigration
      history of the claimant.

  40. She also had sight of a letter from the claimant's psychological well-
      being practitioner. This confirmed that he received an  assessment  on
      28 June 2016 and that his presenting difficulties were  low  mood  and
      anxiety as a result of ongoing immigration problems.  He  was  offered
      therapy.

  41. The Judge has considered the s.119B  considerations  as  part  of  the
      proportionality exercise.

  42. In finding that the decision would be  disproportionate,  he  accepted
      the unchallenged conclusions of Ms Horton relating to  the  claimant's
      psychological distress  including  his  experience  of  isolation  and
      suicidal moods. The nature of his disorder meant that he was  at  risk
      of committing suicide because of the situation. He  went  on  to  find
      that the claimant would find it difficult  to  integrate  if  he  were
      returned because his close family are all in the UK  and  there  is  a
      lack of evidence regarding the support he  would  receive  from  other
      relatives if returned.

  43. Although the finings reached by the Judge might be  considered  to  be
      generous, he has given sustainable  reasons  for  them  based  on  the
      evidence.
