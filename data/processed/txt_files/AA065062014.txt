                      ERROR OF LAW DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, PS, date of birth 2.9.88, is a citizen of Sri Lanka.

 2. This is her appeal against the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Oliver promulgated 13.2.15, allowing on human rights ground  only,  her
    appeal against the decision of the Secretary of  State  to  refuse  her
    asylum, humanitarian protection and human  rights  claims.   The  Judge
    heard the appeal on 21.11.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge Cruthers  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    10.3.15.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 4.8.15 as  an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Oliver should be set aside.

 6. Judge Oliver dismissed the asylum and humanitarian  protection  claims,
    but allowed the appeal on human rights grounds on the basis of  a  risk
    of suicide if returned.

 7. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Cruthers noted that the  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge "seems to have accepted, amongst other things, that
    the appellant had been a victim of detention and rape on return to  her
    home  country  in  2011   (paragraph   67   of   the   decision   under
    consideration).  Taking  into  account,  amongst  other   things,   the
    operation of paragraph 339K of the immigration rules, it  seems  to  me
    arguable that the judge should have allowed this appeal  on  an  asylum
    basis. But the appellant should not take the grant of permission as any
    indication that the appeal will ultimately be successful."

 8. Paragraph 339K provides "The  fact  that  a  person  has  already  been
    subject to persecution or serious harm, or to direct  threats  of  such
    persecution or such harm, will be regarded as a serious  indication  of
    the person's well-founded fear of persecution or real risk of suffering
    serious harm, unless there are  good  reasons  to  consider  that  such
    persecution or serious harm will not be repeated."

 9. At �67 of the decision, Judge Oliver  found  that  the  appellant  "has
    shown to the lower standard that she was the victim  of  detention  and
    rape, broadly as she described, on  her  return  in  2011."  The  judge
    described this an appalling event and accepted that  she  was  able  to
    leave the country within a few days of the  incident.  The  judge  also
    found the failure to mention the rape in the  screening  interview  was
    explicable and other discrepancies were minor and comfortably explained
    with the medical evidence, which was found entirely consistent with the
    appellant's account. In relation to the  demonstration  the  judge  was
    unable to reach any clear conclusion, but considered that she may  have
    confessed falsely.

10. At �70 of the decision the judge set out extracts from the headnote  of
    GJ & Others (post civil war: returnees) Sri Lanka CG [2013] UKUT 00319,
    which includes this phrase from the headnote: "If a person is  detained
    by the Sri Lankan security services there remains a real risk  of  ill-
    treatment or harm requiring international protection."

11. However, the significant difference in this case is that the judge  did
    not accept that the appellant had been detained and abused by  the  Sri
    Lankan authorities.

12. I do not accept Ms Meredith's interpretation  of  �72  to  �74  of  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal, suggesting that the judge accepted
    that the appellant had been the victim of rape and abuse by Sri  Lankan
    authorities. Whilst the judge accepted that she had been  detained  and
    treated as claimed, the judge raised  and  gave  consideration  to  two
    possible reasons for the appellant's detention a few days after arrival
    through the airport in 2011. The first, is that the earlier  perception
    of the authorities (that she was of no  adverse  interest)  might  have
    changed because of her confession to have attended  the  demonstration,
    and she was now perceived  to  be  someone  who  had  been  politicised
    abroad. The judge concluded, however, that this  would  not  place  her
    within the risk categories.

13. The second reason why she may have been detained, and which  the  judge
    found "much the more likely," was that  she  was  picked  up  by  rogue
    elements, acting without state authority, and thus an event which would
    be unlikely to be repeated on return. The judge reasoned that this  was
    the more likely explanation because she was able to leave Sri Lanka  in
    the normal way using her own identity, without  any  difficulties  from
    the authorities. At �74  the  judge  concluded  that  either  way,  the
    appellant does not come within the risk categories and would not face a
    real risk of persecution or article 3 treatment on return.

14. It appears from the above that the judge reached  the  conclusion  that
    the appellant was  not  detained  or  ill-treated  by  the  Sri  Lankan
    authorities, but rather by rogue elements unconnected with  the  state.
    Considered as a whole, the decision  is  carefully  written  and  takes
    fully into account the appellant's factual claim and finds it  entirely
    consistent with the medical evidence. However, I am not satisfied  that
    the findings and conclusions at �72 to �74 are cogently reasoned. It is
    not clear whether the judge was rejecting the first  possibility  of  a
    change of attitude by the Sri Lankan authorities, even though the judge
    preferred the second explanation of 'rogue elements.' If the first  was
    still a reasonably likely possibility, then the judge  failed  to  give
    any weight to the risk of further ill-treatment on the  basis  of  past
    detention and ill-treatment, both under GJ and paragraph  339K  of  the
    Immigration Rules.

15. Further, the appellant's case was that she  was  questioned  about  her
    sister and brother (see �36 of her witness statement), which  would  be
    something known to  the  authorities  and  not  necessarily  by  'rogue
    elements.' It is not clear that the judge considered the  family  links
    between the appellant and other family members. �45  of  Forah  v  Home
    Secretary [2007] 1AC, points out that arbitrary  persecution  can  take
    place simply because a person is a member of the same family as someone
    else. A family member merely by connection to a refugee  is  vulnerable
    to acts of persecution. The evidence of the appellant's sister  at  A20
    is that she was granted refugee status and was suffering PTSD from  her
    treatment in Sri Lanka. Her claim was that the authorities  raped  her.
    This appellant claims that this was mentioned to her when she was raped
    in 2011. The appellant's brother has also been granted refugee  status.
    Connections with a family member who was a senior member  of  the  LTTE
    was recognised in GJ at �359 onwards.

16. This issue although present in the case and evidence before the  First-
    tier Tribunal was not addressed by the judge. Taken into  account  with
    the possibility of a false confession and change of perception  by  the
    Sri Lankan authorities, I find that the reasoning and conclusion at �72-
    �74 is inadequate to dismiss the question as to whether  the  appellant
    may come within the risk categories of GJ. The judge  has  to  make  an
    overall assessment of the evidence and consider all aspects together. I
    am not satisfied that a comprehensive assessment has been conducted  in
    this case.

17.  In  the  circumstances,  I  find  that  the  decision  on  asylum  and
    humanitarian protection grounds is flawed for error of law  and  should
    be set aside to be remade.

18. When a decision of the First-tier Tribunal has been set aside,  section
    12(2) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 requires either
    that the case is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal  with  directions,
    or it must be remade by the Upper Tribunal. The scheme of the Tribunals
    Court and Enforcement Act 2007 does not assign the function of  primary
    fact finding to the Upper Tribunal. Where the facts and conclusions are
    unclear on a crucial issue at the heart of an appeal, as  they  are  in
    this case, effectively there has not  been  a  valid  determination  of
    those issues. The errors identified vitiate the findings  of  fact  and
    the conclusions from those facts so that there has  not  been  a  valid
    determination of the issues in the appeal.

19. In all the  circumstances,  I  remit  this  appeal  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal on the basis that this is a case which falls  squarely  within
    the Senior President's Practice Statement at paragraph 7.2. The  effect
    of the error has been to deprive the appellant of a  fair  hearing  and
    that the nature or  extent  of  any  judicial  fact  finding  which  is
    necessary for the decision in the appeal to be re-made  is  such  that,
    having regard to the overriding objective in rule 2 to deal with  cases
    fairly and justly, including with the avoidance of delay, I  find  that
    it is appropriate to remit this appeal to the  First-tier  Tribunal  to
    determine the appeal afresh on the asylum and  humanitarian  protection
    grounds only.

20. There has been no cross-appeal in relation to  the  decision  on  human
    rights grounds and thus that part of the decision must stand as made.

Conclusion & Decision:

21. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that the decision in  respect
    of asylum and humanitarian protection only  should  be  set  aside  and
    remade.

                    I set aside the decision dismissing the appeal on asylum
                    and humanitarian protection grounds;

                    I preserve the decision allowing  the  appeal  on  human
                    rights;

                    I remit the appeal  to  be  reheard  in  the  First-tier
                    Tribunal.

Consequential Directions

22. The appeal is to be relisted in the First-tier  Tribunal  for  a  fresh
    hearing in relation to asylum and humanitarian protection grounds only;

23. The estimated length of hearing is 3 hours;

24. A Tamil interpreter will be required.


Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal made an order pursuant  to  the  Asylum  and  Immigration  Tribunal
(Procedure) Rules.

Given the circumstances, I continue the anonymity order.


Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

I make no fee award.

Reasons: No fee is payable and thus there can be no fee award.
