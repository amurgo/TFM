Representation:
For the Appellants:    Ms V Laughton instructed by VC Legal (UK)
For the Respondent:    Mr G Saunders, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The first appellant is a citizen of Turkey who was born on  14  January
    1976.  The second appellant is her son who was born on 11 March 2003.

 2. The first appellant arrived in the United Kingdom as a  visitor  on  27
    March 2011.  On 25 May 2011 she was granted limited leave to remain  in
    the United Kingdom until 25 May 2012 in order to establish  a  business
    (known as [ - ]) as a self-employed person providing waxing services to
    clients.  That leave was granted under para 21 of HC  510  pursuant  to
    the EC-Turkey Association  Agreement  (The  "Ankara  Agreement").   The
    first appellant's case is that she commenced that business  on  1  June
    2011.  Thereafter, between June and August  2011  the  first  appellant
    travelled to Turkey on a number of occasions  to  visit  her  dependent
    son, the second appellant.  An initial  application  made  by  him  for
    entry clearance was refused as was a second application but, on appeal,
    the second appellant was successful and he was granted entry clearance.
     He entered the United Kingdom on 23 April 2012 with leave until 25 May
    2012 as a dependent of the first appellant.

 3. On 1 May 2012, the first appellant (and the  second  appellant  as  her
    dependent) made an application for further leave to remain in order  to
    continue her business as a self-employed provider of  waxing  services.
    On  12  November  2012,  the  Secretary  of  State  refused  the  first
    appellant's application on the basis that he was not satisfied that she
    was  genuinely  established  in  business.   The   second   appellant's
    application was refused in line with that of his mother. The  Secretary
    of State also  made  decision  to  remove  the  appellants  by  way  of
    directions under s.47 of the Immigration, Asylum  and  Nationality  Act
    2006

 4.  Both  appellants  appealed  to  the   First-tier   Tribunal.    In   a
    determination dated 8 March 2013, Judge McIntosh dismissed each of  the
    appellant's appeals under HC 510 and under Article 8 of the ECHR.   The
    Judge was not satisfied that the first appellant was genuinely  engaged
    in a business. At para 29 he concluded:

         "29.     I find  that  the  accumulative  effect  of  the  evidence
             submitted by the appellant fails to demonstrate that she has a
             genuine business with a genuine income.  And I therefore  find
             that the appellant has failed to meet the requirements of  the
             Immigration Rules."

 5. The appellants sought permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.  On 2
    April  2013  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Brunnen)  granted   the
    appellants permission to appeal.  Thus, the appeals came before me.

 6. It was common ground before me that the second  appellant's  appeal  to
    the Upper  Tribunal  was  entirely  dependent  on  that  of  the  first
    appellant.

Error of Law

    1. The Submissions

 7. Ms Laughton, who represented the appellants, relied upon  her  skeleton
    argument which she elaborated upon in her submissions.

 8. First, she submitted that the Judge had erred in law by not  concluding
    that the Secretary of State's decision to remove the  appellants  under
    s.47  of   the   Immigration,   Asylum   and   Nationality   Act   2006
    contemporaneously with her decisions to refuse  to  vary  each  of  the
    appellants' leave was not in accordance  with  the  law  following  the
    Court of Appeal's decision in Ahmadi [2013] EWCA Civ 512.  Mr Saunders,
    who represented the respondent, accepted that the s.47  decisions  were
    unlawful.  I need say no more about this ground of appeal other than to
    conclude that, at least to this extent, the First-tier  Tribunal  erred
    in law and to substitute a decision allowing each  of  the  appellants'
    appeals against the s.47 decisions made in respect  of  them  as  being
    "otherwise not in accordance with the law".

 9. Secondly, in relation to the  substantive  decision  made  against  the
    first appellant  Ms  Laughton  submitted  that  the  Judge  had  failed
    properly to deal with a number of documents relied upon  by  the  first
    appellant.  She accepted that the Judge (contrary to what was  said  in
    the grounds) had not found an insurance policy claimed to relate to the
    first appellant's business to  be  a  forgery.   However,  the  Judge's
    finding in relation to other documents, in particular receipts said  to
    be written by the first appellant to clients  and  letters  of  support
    from customers,  was  less  clear.   It  was  not  clear,  Ms  Laughton
    submitted, whether the Judge in paras 26 and 27  of  his  determination
    had found these documents to be forgeries or simply to  be  unreliable.
    That in itself, she submitted, was an error of law.  And, if the  Judge
    had found these documents to be a forgery  she  had  failed  to  direct
    herself appropriately as to the standard and burden of proof.  In  that
    regard she relied on the House of Lords' decision in Re B  [2008]  UKHL
    35.

10. Thirdly, Ms Laughton submitted that the Judge had failed to  take  into
    account relevant evidence supportive of the first appellant's claim  to
    be engaged in a genuine business.  In particular, the Judge had  failed
    to take into account the appellant's tax  return  for  2012  showing  a
    trading profit of �6,611 and accounts together  with  covering  letters
    from the first appellant's accountants,  Dirench  &  Co.   Ms  Laughton
    submitted that, in effect,  the  Judge  had  only  considered  evidence
    which,  in  her  view,  led  her  to  an  adverse  conclusion   without
    considering the evidence which supported the first appellant's claim to
    be in business.  That was an error of law, Ms Laughton submitted.

11. Finally, Ms Laughton submitted that the Judge had failed  to  make  any
    findings in relation to the oral evidence given by  one  of  the  first
    appellant's witnesses, Mrs A who, together with her husband, claimed to
    be clients of the first appellant.   Ms  Laughton  submitted  that  the
    Judge had reached an adverse credibility finding  in  relation  to  the
    first appellant without making any finding  in  relation  to  the  oral
    evidence of Mrs A which supported the first appellant's account and, in
    particular, supported the genuineness of the receipts relied upon in Mr
    and Mrs A's names.

12. On behalf of the respondent, Mr Saunders submitted that the  Judge  had
    not made a forgery finding.  She had simple concluded  that  the  first
    appellant's case was not made out.  He submitted  that  the  Judge  was
    entitled to decide as she  had  looking  at  the  documentary  evidence
    which, he submitted, she had concluded was unreliable.   In  short,  Mr
    Saunders submitted that the Judge had done enough.

    2. The Judge's Decision

13. The Judge's reasons for concluding that the  first  appellant  had  not
    established that her business was genuine were at paras  23-31  of  the
    determination as follows:

         "23.     The appellant was invited to attend an interview with  the
             Secretary of State in October 2012 but failed  to  attend  the
             appointment.   During  her   evidence   she   was   questioned
             extensively regarding  her  training,  her  business  and  her
             clientele.  I did not find the  appellant  to  be  a  credible
             witness.  This is because  I  found  the  appellant  lacked  a
             genuine interest in her own business.  When  questioned  about
             the one beauty course she attended, she stated that  that  the
             course commenced at 11 am and concluded at 2  or  3  pm.   The
             appellant was unable to recall how much the course cost.   The
             evidence submitted at O2 of the appeal file  states  that  the
             one day course commenced at 10.30 am and concluded at 4.00  pm
             costing �249.00.  The appellant further demonstrated a lack of
             interest  in  her  business  having  apparently  renewed   her
             insurance in May 2012 but only becoming aware of the  numerous
             discrepancies in November 2012 after the refusal  notification
             from the Secretary of State.  I note the insurance policy from
             Salon Gold was  accordingly  amended  to  address  the  errors
             highlighted in the refusal notice of  the  12  November  2012.
             The amendments were not accompanied by a covering letter which
             one would have reasonably have expected, apologising  for  the
             errors made and reassuring the customer the  insurance  policy
             remains valid.  Although  such  a  letter  is  not  conclusive
             evidence as to the genuine nature  of  insurance  policy,  the
             appellant's indifference  to  the  document,  I  found  to  be
             indicative  of  the  appellant's   intention   regarding   her
             business.

         24. It is evident that Salon Gold provides a policy  of  insurance
             for the appellant,  however,  I  am  not  satisfied  that  the
             business is a genuine going concern and  that  the  policy  of
             insurance  has  been  obtained  to  support  the   appellant's
             application.

         25. In evidence the appellant stated that she has approximately 11
             clients who regularly use her services.  Of  her  clients  two
             were new clients as of October 2011 and one client who remains
             with her is her flat mate.

         26. There is evidence within the appeal file typed reference  from
             named clients at page K1 to K4 of the  bundle.   I  find  that
             each of the letters contain the  same  face  type,  same  type
             setting and formulation on the  page,  giving  the  impression
             that the letters were not typed separately by the  individual.
             Each of the references to which I have been referred are  very
             general in their content with  nothing  detailed  or  specific
             about the particular treatment they receive.  In a similar way
             I find that the hand  written  receipts  may  have  been  hand
             written at the same time.

         27. I noted that although Mr and Mrs A were  said  to  be  regular
             customers that each of the receipts  contained  not  just  the
             service provided and the  cash  payment  made.   Each  receipt
             contained the name of the individual and the name [ -  ]  with
             the post code and the address of the customer  with  the  post
             code of the appellant's address.  This was also the  case  for
             the appellant's flat mate SS as exhibited at N4 of the  appeal
             file.  It appears that the receipts are written  not  for  the
             purpose of a receipt written for the customer but rather  that
             they were written for the purpose of  submitting  evidence  to
             bolster the appellant's application.

         28. The reference written by Ms  GT  dated  31  October  2012  she
             states that

                  "I go to Orpington every week to visit my cousin, and once
                  in a month I pick up BO for waxing in Hawkurst/Kent  where
                  I live and own a public house business."

             This would indicate that at times that appellant  is  assisted
             by her customers to transport herself  and  equipment  to  the
             home of her clients.  In evidence the appellant did not  refer
             to  the  assistance  from  her  client  to   attending   their
             addresses. In addition I note that the appellant's price  list
             for the service she provides as  excessive  in  comparison  to
             similar business for which the appellant  has  provided  price
             lists.  In evidence the appellant stated that her service  was
             unlike the others as appears in the price list and  her  costs
             reflect the  expertise  of  the  service  she  provides.   The
             written  references  from  other  named  customers  and   oral
             evidence from Mrs A refer to a very general  service  of  body
             waxing and feet waxing.  The  appellant  gave  evidence  of  a
             specific waxing mixture of oil  and  lime  which  she  created
             herself which is not obtained from a  retail  provider.   From
             the evidence submitted before  me  I  did  not  find  anything
             unique in the service provided by the  appellant  which  would
             reasonably explain the difference in the cost charged  by  the
             appellant  compared  with  other  well   established   service
             providers within the same industry.

         29. I find that the cumulative effect of the evidence submitted by
             the appellant fails to demonstrate  that  she  has  a  genuine
             business with a genuine income.  And I therefore find that the
             appellant  has  failed  to  meet  the  requirements   of   the
             Immigration Rules.

         30. Having regard to the requirements of paragraph 4 and 21 of the
             relevant rules I do not find that he appellant has established
             a genuine need for her service and business.  I find that  the
             Secretary of State has correctly  applied  the  rules  and  is
             entitled to challenge  the  authenticity  of  the  appellant's
             business which she commenced after the grant of leave  in  May
             2011.

         31. For the reasons that  I  have  outlined  I  do  not  find  the
             appellant to be credible  and  I  do  not  find  her  business
             concern to be a genuine  concern.   For  the  reasons  I  have
             referred to I dismiss this appeal. "

    3. Discussion

14. It is convenient to deal with  Ms  Laughton's  submissions  in  reverse
    order.

15. First, I deal  with  the  evidence  of  Mrs  A.   At  para  27  of  her
    determination, the Judge commented on the receipts  relied  on  by  the
    first appellant in respect of the client to whom she had  provided  her
    waxing services.  Those clients included Mr and Mrs A.  The Judge noted
    that the receipts have written upon them the  name  of  the  individual
    together with their address and post code and  also  the  name  of  the
    first appellant's business, [ - ], together with her  post  code.   The
    Judge's conclusion was that these receipts appear to have been written:
    "for the purpose of submitting  evidence  to  bolster  the  appellant's
    application".

16. It is far from clear upon what basis the Judge reached that view.   The
    only reason can be, at least given in para 27, that  they  contain  the
    details of both the customer and of the business.  Whether or not  that
    is a sufficient reason for doubting the reliability of these  receipts,
    that was a view formed in relation to all the receipts including  those
    of Mr and Mrs A.  Mrs A gave oral evidence at  the  hearing.   In  that
    evidence, she confirmed that she and her husband were regular customers
    and she submitted copies of receipts she said had been provided by  the
    appellant between 15 April 2012 and  18  October  2012.   Although  the
    Judge made reference to her evidence at para 17 of  the  determination,
    the Judge at no point in the determination made a finding as to whether
    or not she accepted, in whole or part, Mrs A's evidence.  That evidence
    was supportive of the first appellant's  evidence  in  respect  of  her
    provision of waxing services as part of her business.   Also,  Mrs  A's
    evidence was relevant in assessing  the  reliability  of  the  receipts
    which the Judge determined  were  not  supportive  of  the  appellant's
    account without  regard  to  Mrs  A's  evidence  at  para  27.   In  my
    judgement, the Judge erred in law in failing to  make  any  finding  in
    relation to Mrs A and the oral evidence she gave at the hearing.

17. Secondly, the Judge failed to  have  regard  to  the  totality  of  the
    documentary evidence submitted on behalf of the first appellant.  As is
    clear from paras 23-30 that I set out above, the Judge  looked  at  the
    insurance policy which the appellant claimed related  to  her  business
    but discounted it at para 24.  The Judge looked at the letters from the
    appellant's claimed customers at paras 26 and 28  but  also  discounted
    them. In addition, as I have already set out, she looked at the claimed
    receipts for services provided by  the  first  appellant  at  para  27.
    However, the Judge made no specific reference to  the  appellant's  tax
    return for the year 2012 and the accounts produced by  her  accountant.
    Whilst, of  course,  these  documents  are  produced  from  information
    supplied by the first appellant,  they  are  nevertheless  relevant  in
    assessing whether the appellant's evidence was to be accepted that  she
    operated a waxing business.  In failing to take into  account  relevant
    evidence, the Judge erred in law.

18. It is not necessary for me to deal with Ms Laughton's first  submission
    that the Judge found some of the documents to be forgeries and in doing
    so failed to apply  the  correct  standard  of  proof  because,  in  my
    judgement, the  errors  I  have  identified  above  are  sufficient  in
    themselves to conclude that the Judge's adverse credibility finding  is
    flawed  and  that  his  finding  that  the  first  appellant  had   not
    established she was operating  a  genuine  business  cannot  stand.   I
    cannot be  satisfied  that,  without  these  errors,  the  Judge  would
    necessarily have come to the same  conclusion.   The  Judge's  decision
    cannot stand and I set it aside.

19. These are the reasons for the decision I indicated to  the  parties  at
    the hearing at the conclusion of their submissions.

Remaking the Decision

    1. The Evidence

    The Documents

20. Without  objection  from  Mr  Saunders,  Ms  Laughton  relied  upon  an
    "addendum appellant's bundle" ("AA" bundle).  That bundle contained  an
    updated witness statement from the first appellant, documents  relating
    to the  first  appellant's  tax  affairs  including  a  self-assessment
    statement dated 9 December 2012,  her  tax  return  for  2013,  interim
    accounts for the period between  6  April  2012  and  31  October  2012
    together with a covering letter from the first appellant's accountants,
    Dirench & Co dated 31 October 2012.  In addition,  there  is  a  letter
    dated 2 July 2012 from Bartlett's Solicitors addressed (I was told)  to
    a client of the first appellant who had made a claim on  her  insurance
    policy.  Further, there is a copy  of  an  insurance  policy  effective
    between 16 May 2011 and 15 May 2012 from Salon  Gold  covering  (it  is
    said) any liability arising from the first appellant carrying  out  her
    services.  Also, there is a brief statement dated 11 June 2013 from  SS
    who is in a relationship with the first appellant and  has  lived  with
    her for two years.

21. Ms Laughton also relied upon  further  correspondence  from  Bartlett's
    Solicitors dated 8 May 2013 to Ms S in relation to a claim made (it  is
    said) by Ms S against the first appellant.  Attached to that letter  is
    an advice on damages from  Counsel  in  relation  to  that  claim.   Ms
    Laughton  indicated  that  she  had  only  been  provided   with   this
    documentation on the day of the hearing.  As she understood  it,  Ms  S
    had  waived  the  professional  privilege  which  attached   to   these
    documents.  However, she indicated that she had no written document  to
    that effect.  I indicated to the representatives that if this  document
    was to be admitted into evidence I had to be satisfied that  Ms  S  had
    waived professional privilege.

22. To that end, the  first  appellant  briefly  gave  evidence  about  the
    circumstances in which she had received these documents.  She  told  me
    that Ms S had given them to her.  She  said  that  Ms  S  had  done  so
    knowing that the first appellant intended to use the documents in  this
    appeal.  In cross-examination, the first appellant  accepted  that  she
    did not have anything in writing from Ms S but confirmed that  she  had
    given the first appellant the  documents  to  use  in  the  case.   She
    confirmed that Ms S was still a client despite  her  having  brought  a
    claim for injury caused by the first appellant.

23. Although Mr Saunders submitted that it was  difficult  to  believe  the
    first appellant's evidence that Ms S was still her  client,  I  see  no
    basis on which I can reject the clear and unequivocal evidence  of  the
    first appellant that she was given these documents  by  Ms  S  in  full
    knowledge that they would be used in this appeal.  It is most  unlikely
    that these documents were provided to the  first  appellant  solely  as
    part of the insurance claim brought against her.  For these reasons,  I
    was satisfied that Ms S had waived  professional  privilege.   On  that
    basis, Mr Saunders did not object to the admission of  these  documents
    under rule 15(2A) of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008
    (SI 2008/2698).

    The Oral Evidence

24. In addition to the documentary evidence, the first appellant and Ms  SS
    gave oral evidence.

25. In her oral evidence, the first appellant adopted her statements of  29
    January 2013 and 11 June 2013.  She confirmed that she was paid for her
    services in cash.  When asked how it was that her bank account did  not
    reflect the sums she said she received through her sales invoices,  the
    first appellant said that she only went to the bank  whenever  she  had
    time.  She did not do this on a regular basis.  When she did  that  she
    deposited almost all of the income she received but not all of it, just
    almost all of it.  She was further asked whether she charged  different
    people different sums.  The first appellant said that she did not.  For
    a full body wax she charges ladies �100 and men �120.  That figure  did
    not change depending upon the client.

26. The first appellant was also asked about the letters of support written
    by her claimed clients and the Secretary  of  State's  suggestion  that
    these letters were all written in the same way with the same font.  The
    first appellant explained that the letters were  initially  emailed  to
    her by clients.  She then copied and pasted the  text  into  an  Office
    Word document, then she took the letters to her clients and they signed
    them.  That was why the letters looked similar.

27. As regards her invoices, the first appellant said that she  did  create
    invoices for each of her services.  She kept one copy and gave one copy
    to her  clients.   She  then  gave  hers  to  her  accountant  and  her
    accountant had prepared the list of  clients  which  she  submitted  in
    evidence.  I noted that the first appellant had with her a  book  which
    she said was her invoice book.

28. In cross-examination, the first appellant said that she had not brought
    any up to date bank statements with her.  She estimated that she earned
    about �1,380 per month.  She confirmed that she deposited almost all of
    it in her bank account.  She was asked whether  she  ran  her  business
    from her home address.  She  said  "Yes",  but  she  did  not  actually
    provide services there.  She went out to her clients.   She  said  that
    she always did this.  She was asked when she had first obtained  a  car
    and she said that it was less than a year ago.  When asked how she  got
    around before she had the car she said that she had not  actually  used
    it for business purposes because all her clients lived within 10 or  15
    minutes from where she lived.  She said that she made one visit to each
    client per month and currently she had 13 clients on her list.

29. The first appellant confirmed that she paid �450 per month  rent.   She
    said that the actual rent for her home was �900  but  she  shares  that
    with her partner.  She was asked why she produced the letters from  her
    clients in the way that she had and why she had not got  them  to  sign
    them when she saw them each month.  The first appellant said  that  she
    had had to produce the documents for her solicitors quite  quickly  and
    the way she had done it was  the  best  way  to  do  it  by,  what  she
    described as a "accelerated procedure".

30. The first appellant was asked about Ms S.  Initially she said that  she
    could not remember precisely when she had  last  given  her  treatment.
    However, she confirmed that she saw her regularly once a month and that
    was usually at the beginning of the month and the first appellant  then
    recalled that she saw her last on 11 June and she had given her a  full
    body wax.  The first appellant was asked about Ms S's injuries and  she
    said that there were no visible scars just faint marks.  She said  that
    they were like stains, a slight lighter colour than  her  natural  skin
    colour.  She confirmed that after the accident she carried on providing
    services to Ms S.  Initially she had had bandages on and  she  had  not
    seen the injured area.  When the bandages had come off she had not seen
    any scars and no bleeding only the marks she had  described.   She  was
    asked about the claim Ms S had made on the insurance policy.  She  said
    that she did not know whether the insurance company had physically paid
    her any money yet.  She had been told that Ms  S  was  considering  the
    amount that had been offered to her.  She said that she  believed  that
    it was �1,500.

31. Ms SS also gave oral evidence.  She confirmed her name and her  address
    as being the same as that of the  first  appellant.   She  adopted  her
    statement of 11 June 2013.

32. In cross-examination, she confirmed that she was the first  appellant's
    partner and she was a British citizen.  She was asked about  the  first
    appellant's business.  She said that the first appellant went  to  them
    rather than the  clients  coming  to  the  house  and  that  the  first
    appellant  did  this  by  walking.   She  was  asked  about  the  first
    appellant's income and confirmed that it was �1380 per month.  She said
    that the first appellant had new clients and that she had  been  making
    this amount for the last few  months.  She  confirmed  that  the  first
    appellant lost clients when some went back to Turkey or some moved.

33. Ms SS confirmed that she and the first appellant paid the rent  on  the
    home.  She said that she had just started last week a full-time job  in
    a restaurant but before that she had not been working.  She had been on
    benefit and had been paid �310/�320 every four  weeks.   When  she  was
    asked whether, therefore, the first appellant  paid  the  rest  of  the
    rent, Ms SS said "No", she had been receiving other benefits  and  they
    were sharing everything.

    2. Para 21, HC 510

34. The appellant relies upon para 21 of HC 510 which applies to the  first
    appellant as a Turkish national by virtue of the "standstill clause" in
    the Ankara agreement.  That  is  common  ground  between  the  parties.
    Paragraph 21 provides as follows:

         '21.     People admitted as visitors may apply for the  consent  of
             the Secretary of State to their establishing  themselves  here
             for the purpose of setting up in business,  whether  on  their
             own account or as partners in a new or existing business.  Any
             such application is to be considered  on  merits.   Permission
             will depend on a number of factors,  including  evidence  that
             the applicant will be  devoting  assets  of  his  own  to  the
             business, proportional to his interest in it, that he will  be
             able to bear his share of any  liabilities  the  business  may
             incur, and that his share of its profits will be sufficient to
             support him and any dependants.  The applicant's part  in  the
             business must not amount to disguised employment, and it  must
             be clear that he will not  have  to  supplement  his  business
             activities by employment for which a work permit is  required.
             ... Where the application is granted the applicant's stay  may
             be extended for a period of up to 12 months,  on  a  condition
             restricting his freedom to take employment.  A person admitted
             as a businessman in the  first  instance  may  be  granted  an
             appropriate extension of stay if the conditions set out  above
             are still satisfied at the end of the period for which he  was
             admitted initially.'

35. It was also common ground between the parties that the  sole  issue  in
    the appeal was whether the first appellant  had  established  that  her
    business was genuine.   Mr Saunders accepted that if her  business  was
    genuine then she met the requirements of para 21.

36. I remind myself that the burden of proof is upon the first appellant to
    establish on a balance of probabilities that she meets the requirements
    of para 21 of HC 510.

    3. The Submissions

37. On behalf of the respondent, Mr Saunders relied upon  the  reasons  for
    refusal letter dated 11 November 2012.  That is in the following terms:

         "I have considered  all  evidence  submitted  in  support  of  your
         application made on 1 May 2012.  You claim to have  established  in
         business but on the  basis  of  the  evidence  supplied  I  am  not
         satisfied that you are genuinely trading in business.

         You have failed to  provide  evidence  of  products  and  equipment
         provided to perform the work as you have described.  You  claim  to
         be using a special  wax  from  Turkey  but  you  have  provided  no
         evidence of this, or that it is safe and  acceptable  to  use.   It
         would be essential for you to have purchased equipment  such  as  a
         specialist table and you  would  need  regular  purchases  of  wax,
         gloves and applicators.

         Further you have provided no evidence that you  have  the  relevant
         experience, qualifications or licenses to  carry  out  the  service
         described or for such a premium above the cost of your competitors.
          You provided a certificate from the National Beauty Institute  for
         a  'course  in  Waxing"  which  claims  that  you  are  "now  fully
         certified".  This  certificate   is   not   accredited   with   any
         organisation other than 'National Beauty Institute' and consists of
         a one day training course.  This is confirmed on their website.

         You have demonstrated no  means  of  transporting  your  equipment.
         Notably you have submitted a photocopy of  a  vehicle  registration
         that you have stated to have acquired on 20 October 2012.  You have
         not had transport before this date and there is  no  actual  policy
         evidence to show that it is insured for  business  purposes.   Also
         based on the size of the vehicle I am not  satisfied  that  it  was
         purchased for business use or that it would be suitable for.

         I have further concerns  with  your  evidence  of  trade  provided.
         Transactions on your business bank account do not  reflect  any  of
         the sales invoices  you  have  provided.   Checks  on  your  client
         addresses have shown anomalies - one of your clients address, 6 [ -
         ] Drive, regularly has the wrong postcode for  the  address,  which
         should be [ - ].

         Your business  insurance  policy  document  also  gives  cause  for
         concern.  None of the dates on the document  correspond  and  there
         are  errors  which  have  not  been  amended.   The  covering  page
         "Certificate of Public Liability Insurance" give the dates that the
         cover is effective from as 16/5/2376  to  15/05/2012.   The  second
         page 'Salon Gold Freelancers Policy Schedule' states effective date
         to 16/05/2376, dated of issue 10/04/2012, expiry date as 15/05/2013
         and renewal date as 16/05/2012.   None  of  these  dates  make  any
         senses and on that basis I  do  not  believe  the  document  to  be
         genuine.

         The letters from clients you have provided are written in the  same
         font, font size, print  quality  and  formatting.   None  of  these
         letters have contact numbers to be able to verify  them.  You  have
         not provided any contact numbers for any of your clients.   Further
         from the evidence you have provided you have not  diversified  your
         client base beyond  the  Turkish  community.   You  have  shown  no
         evidence that you have developed any English language skills or any
         qualifications which would be essential for operating a business.

         I do not find your prices as described credible  as  in  comparison
         with  established  businesses  in  your  area.   Your  prices   are
         significantly greater than those of  more  established  businesses.
         These businesses also have premises, employee and other  costs  yet
         there prices are much more competitive.  Analysis of  your  invoice
         books show that you have rarely invoiced for less than a full  body
         wax. Notably you have charged different prices for the same service
         to the same individuals at different times."

38. Mr Saunders submitted that it was for me to decide whether  I  accepted
    the appellant's evidence of how she had  obtained  supporting  evidence
    from her clients.  He submitted that the objections  expressed  by  the
    Secretary of State in relation to the appellant's bank  statements  not
    reflecting her sales invoices remained good.  There were, he submitted,
    no up to date bank statements.  As regards her accounts, he reminded me
    that these were based on information that the  appellant  had  provided
    and were not therefore independent evidence of her income.  He  pointed
    out that she had not claimed rent in her tax  account  despite  running
    her business from home.   As  regards  the  insurance  policy  and  the
    alleged claim made on it, Mr Saunders submitted that I  had  heard  the
    evidence and it was "utterly unbelievable" that Ms S would continue  to
    use the appellant's services after she had been injured in the way that
    was claimed.

39. Ms Laughton relied upon her skeleton argument and  submitted  that  the
    refusal letter did not stand up to scrutiny.  In that regard she relied
    on the points made at paras 28-41 of her skeleton.  She submitted  that
    the explanation that the appellant had given as to how she had obtained
    the letters of support was not inherently unbelievable or "convoluted".
     Ms Laughton submitted that there was nothing untoward in the appellant
    not claiming to set off any rent on her home as she  did  not  use  the
    premises for business.  As regards the insurance documentation,  whilst
    there was clearly an error in the date in the original policy, that had
    now been corrected by the broker in the documents at pages 39-42 of the
    AA bundle.  In addition, the evidence concerning  the  insurance  claim
    which named the first appellant and described the  injuries  as  having
    occurred in the course of the first appellant's  business  demonstrated
    that the insurance policy  was  genuine  and  that  the  appellant  was
    carrying out the service as she claimed.  Ms Laughton also relied  upon
    the tax and accounting documentation.  She submitted that it  was  most
    unlikely that the first appellant would pay a substantial amount of tax
    if in fact she was  not  genuinely  carrying  on  that  business.   She
    submitted that I should accept the evidence of the first appellant  and
    her partner  which  I  had  heard.   Ms  Laughton  submitted  that  the
    appellant had established that she was genuinely carrying on a business
    in the UK.

    4. Discussion and Findings

40. The evidence of the first appellant is that she  had  since  June  2011
    carried on a business as [ - ] providing a waxing service  to  clients.
    She has currently 13 clients.  She charges �100 for women and �120  for
    men for a full  waxing  service.  She  provides  the  services  at  her
    clients' home but not at her own property.  She sees her  clients  once
    per month and currently earns �1380 per month.  All  her  clients  live
    within 10 or 15 minutes of her home and she walks to  see  them  taking
    her equipment with her which includes  a  beauty  table  together  with
    waxes etc which she largely prepares herself.  In her evidence,  Ms  SS
    confirmed that the first appellant carries on this  business  and  that
    she provides Ms SS with the service herself.

41. In support of her claim, the first appellant relies upon  a  number  of
    receipts (at  pages  37-47  of  her  original  appeal  bundle).   These
    receipts relate to a Mr and Mrs A and in Mrs A's statement (at page  35
    of that bundle) she confirms that  the  first  appellant  provides  the
    service and that the receipts relate to that.  That was  also  Mrs  A's
    oral  evidence  given  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   The   first
    appellant submitted a birth certificate (at page 43 of the  AA  bundle)
    which showed the birth of a baby to Mr and Mrs A on 8 May 2013 and,  it
    was said, this was the reason why Mrs A had not  been  able  to  attend
    this hearing.

42. In addition, the first appellant relies upon a number of tax  documents
    and accounts and other documents relating  to  her  financial  affairs.
    The first appellant's accounts for the tax year 2012 and her tax return
    for that year are at L2-L11.  Her tax return is at P1-P17.    Contained
    in bundle AA at pages 3-5 are self-assessment documents in relation  to
    the first appellant's NI contributions in March and October 2012 and  a
    self-assessment statement in relation to her tax dated 9 December  2012
    and showing a bank  stamp  for  the  amount  paid  of  �2,609.53.   The
    appellant's tax return for 2013 is at  pages  8-31  of  the  AA  bundle
    showing a profit of �6,611.  The  first  appellant's  interim  accounts
    provided by Dirench & Co for the period 6 April 2012 to 31 October 2012
    are at pages 32-37 of the AA bundle and show a profit of �8,420.

43. The first appellant also  relies  upon  the  letters  from  (she  says)
    various clients speaking to the provision  of  her  services  at  K1-K4
    together with a list of clients at K5.  An updated list of  clients  is
    at page 6 of bundle AA.

44. In addition, the first appellant  relies  upon  the  existence  of  her
    public  liability  insurance  for  her  "Freelance  Beauty   Therapist"
    services.  The documents are at pages  39-43  of  the  AA  bundle.   In
    relation to that, the first appellant  relies  upon  a  combination  of
    correspondence from the solicitors, Bartletts dated  2  July  2012  (at
    page 38 of bundle AA) and 8 May 2013 with the appended Counsel's advice
    in relation to a claim brought by Ms S  against  the  first  appellant.
    That advice refers to the claimant having undergone treatment performed
    by the first appellant who  accidentally  splashed  hot  wax  onto  the
    claimant's legs  causing  her  burns  and  subsequent  scarring.   That
    incident is stated to have occurred on 21 May 2012.

45. Let me first deal with the oral evidence of the first appellant and  Ms
    SS.  Both witnesses gave their evidence in a clear manner and I  formed
    the impression that  they  were  seeking  to  tell  the  truth.   Their
    evidence was  wholly  consistent  on  a  number  of  material  matters,
    including the first appellant's working method of visiting her  clients
    and in relation to her monthly income  and  total  number  of  clients.
    Their evidence was also  in  harmony  in  relation  to  their  personal
    arrangements concerning the paying of the rent on their home.

46. The first appellant has also provided a  number  of  letters  from  her
    clients supporting her evidence that she carries  on  her  business  as
    claimed. I do not accept the respondent's  reasons  for  doubting  this
    evidence on  the  basis  that  the  letters  have  a  somewhat  similar
    appearance.   In my judgement, the first  appellant  gave  a  plausible
    explanation, which I accept, that she obtained  the  content  of  these
    letters from her clients by email and then herself cut and pasted those
    into word documents which she then took  to  the  individuals  to  sign
    because of the urgency of producing the documentation.  The  similarity
    in the documentation is  thus  explained.   The  fact  that  the  first
    appellant has maintained her client base within the  Turkish  community
    casts no doubt on the credit worthiness of her evidence.

47. As regards the receipts, I do not accept  that  these  are  other  than
    genuine.  The first appellant has explained why her bank statements  do
    not show precisely the same amounts as she claims to have  received  in
    cash because she does not always pay the whole of her receipts into the
    bank.   The  generalised  statement  in   the   refusal   letter   that
    "[t]transactions on your bank account do not reflect any  of  the  sale
    invoices you have provided" does not, in my  judgement,  highlight  any
    deficiency in this evidence which would  lead  me  to  doubt  it.   The
    genuineness of those addressed to Mr and Mrs A is supported by Mrs  A's
    evidence given before the First-tier Tribunal.  Although  she  did  not
    attend the hearing before me for entirely understandable  reasons,  her
    evidence remains unchallenged.

48. Further, the first appellant has, in my view, adequately explained  her
    qualification obtained  following  a  course  at  the  National  Beauty
    Institute (see pages O1 and O2 of the respondent's bundle).  The  email
    at page 27 of the original bundle from Bromley Council states that  the
    first appellant requires no licence  to  operate  as  a  mobile  waxing
    therapist.   It is not clear what further qualification  or  experience
    or licence the Secretary of State considers, having made this point  in
    the refusal letter, the first appellant should have in order  to  carry
    out her business as a waxing therapist.   Without  evidence  that  more
    would be required of the first appellant, nothing in the  documentation
    leads me to conclude that she does not have the necessary qualification
    to carry out this service.  In addition, she has provided, both in  her
    witness statement and in the documents, evidence of  the  products  and
    equipment that she uses, including a table and waxing products that she
    makes up for her services.  She has also provided, in my  judgement,  a
    wholly adequate explanation that she carries out her "mobile"  services
    by walking to her clients who live within a short  distance  from  her.
    Finally, as regards her prices being greater  than  others  offering  a
    waxing  service,  I  accept  the  explanation  that  these  are   false
    comparators.  The first appellant provides  a  mobile  service  at  the
    client's address and it is entirely plausible that  clients  would  pay
    extra for the convenience of this.

49. In reaching my decision, the insurance documentation  which  the  first
    appellant  has  submitted  is  important.   She  has  now  submitted  a
    corrected policy schedule showing  an  effective  date  of  "16/5/2011"
    rather than the obviously wrong date of "16/05/2376"  in  the  document
    originally submitted.  The first appellant has explained that  she  was
    not aware of the error until it was pointed out to her and  the  broker
    has now corrected that.  The document now shows  a  date  of  issue  of
    12/05/2011 with an effective date of 16/05/2011.  The  expiry  date  is
    15/05/2012 and the renewal date is 16/05/2012.  Even  if  the  original
    effective date remained, there is no basis for the Secretary of State's
    view expressed in the refusal letter that "none of these dates make any
    sense and on that basis I do not believe the document to  be  genuine".
    Apart from the date in the year 2376,  the  other  dates  make  perfect
    sense when read together.  The date of issue was a few days before  the
    effective date of the policy and the expiry date is one day before  the
    annual renewal date.

50. But, in any event, the documentation dealing with the claim brought  by
    Ms S as one of the first appellant's clients for injuries caused during
    a waxing procedure provided by the first appellant demonstrates, in  my
    judgement, that a valid insurance policy  exists  and  that  the  first
    appellant provides the services she claims.  These documents  can  have
    nothing other than a genuine provenance unless it is suggested, which I
    do not accept, that it is some sort of elaborate ploy  to  support  the
    first appellant's application for leave.   Not  only  would  the  first
    appellant have had to take out  a  policy  not  related  to  a  genuine
    business but also she and Ms S would, in effect, have had  to  conspire
    to defraud the insurance company on a false claim for injuries she  did
    not suffer  during  the  course  of  the  first  appellant's  business.
    Despite the perhaps surprised response of Ms S - she continued  to  use
    the first appellant's services even though she had been injured - I  do
    not accept that there is a concerted effort by the first appellant  and
    Ms S falsely to set up a legal claim for the purpose  of  supporting  a
    false claim by the first appellant for leave.

51. In addition, the first appellant's tax and account  documents  which  I
    have referred to above on their face support her  claim  to  have  been
    running a business since June 2011.  The accounts and returns cover the
    tax years 2012 and 2013.  I do not  accept  that  the  first  appellant
    would pay �2,609.53 on 3 January 2013 to HM Revenue and Customs  unless
    she was genuinely engaged in a business giving rise to that  liability.
    Although  the  information  giving  rise   to   her   liability   must,
    necessarily, come  from  the  first  appellant,  I  accept  that  these
    documents show a genuine income arising from a genuine business.

52. Consequently, I accept the evidence of the first appellant  and  Ms  SS
    whom I find to be credible. I also accept the  documentation  as  being
    genuine and supporting the first appellant's evidence that she has been
    engaged in a business providing a  mobile  waxing  service  since  June
    2011.   She continues in that business today.

53. For these reasons, I find that the first appellant has established on a
    balance of probabilities that she meets the requirements of para 21  of
    HC 510.

Decision

54. The decisions of the First-tier  Tribunal  to  dismiss  the  first  and
    second appellants' appeals involved the making  of  an  error  of  law.
    Those decisions cannot stand and are set aside.

55. I remake the decision so as to allow the first appellant's appeal  (and
    also the second  appellant's  appeal  as  her  dependent)  against  the
    refusal to extend her leave to remain  on  the  basis  that  the  first
    appellant meets the requirements of para 21 of HC 510.

56. Further, I allow both the appeals of the first  and  second  appellants
    against the decisions made to remove them under s.47 of the 2006 Act on
    the basis that those decisions were not in accordance with the law.




                               Signed
