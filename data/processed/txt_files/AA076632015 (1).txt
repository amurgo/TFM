                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. This appeal has its origins  in  a  decision  made  on  behalf  of  the
    Secretary of State for the Home Department (the "Secretary  of  State")
    dated 21 April 2015,  whereby  the  application  of  the  Appellant,  a
    national of Iraq aged  28  years,  for  asylum  was  refused.   By  its
    decision promulgated on 02 July  2015,  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (the
    "FtT") dismissed the Appellant's ensuing appeal.

 2. The three grounds of appeal, collectively, complain that the  Appellant
    was denied a fair hearing (our summary), and that  the  FtT  misapplied
    the established objective facts to the Appellant's case and misdirected
    itself as regards certain legal and factual  matters.   The  Judge  who
    granted permission to appeal placed particular emphasis  on  the  first
    ground:
         "Legal aid funding had  been  granted  to  the  Appellant,  shortly
         before the hearing, to obtain an expert report to  demonstrate  the
         changing country conditions in Iraq because of  the  activities  of
         ISIS and the Appellant's claim that, as  a  Kurdish  Sunni  Muslim,
         [he] would not find safety anywhere within  Iraq.   The  Judge  was
         told that submissions would be made urging him not  to  follow  [HM
         and Others (Article 15(c) Iraq) CG [2012] UKUT 409  (IAC)]  because
         of changing conditions there ...
         The Judge refused the application, saying  ...  that  he  was  'not
         persuaded that an expert's report would add anything to this  case'
         ..."

    The grant of permission to appeal is silent as regards the other  three
    grounds.

 3. In brief compass, as recorded in the FtT's decision, the hearing  began
    with an application for an adjournment by  counsel  on  behalf  of  the
    Appellant on the ground that, legal aid having been  secured  only  the
    previous day for instructing an expert, the Appellant wished to  do  so
    with a view to obtaining expert evidence which  would  demonstrate  the
    significant changing country conditions on account of the activities of
    ISIS and that such evidence could potentially  support  his  contention
    that, being a Kurdish Sunni Muslim,  he  would  not  be  safe  anywhere
    within Iraq.  The adjournment application was refused.

Consideration and Conclusions

 4. The correct approach to  adjournment  requests  is  set  forth  in  the
    decision of this Tribunal in  Nwaigwe  (Adjournment:  Fairness)  [2014]
    UKUT 00418 (IAC), at [5] - [8].   Stated  succinctly,  the  overarching
    criterion is that of fairness and the basic test to be  applied  in  an
    error of law appeal is whether a refusal to adjourn the first  instance
    hearing had the effect of depriving the appellant of  his  right  to  a
    fair hearing.

 5. The factual matrix bearing on the  adjournment  issue  in  the  present
    appeal, as summarised above, is uncontentous. Taking into  account  the
    additional observations of  this  Tribunal  in  Nwiagwe,  there  is  no
    warrant for concluding that the adjournment  application  was  made  on
    trivial or spurious grounds or  was  tantamount  to  a  misuse  of  the
    process  of  the  FtT.   The  Judge,  in   refusing   the   adjournment
    application, made no reference to  Nwaigwe  and  failed  to  apply  the
    correct test.  Furthermore, he failed to engage with the  substance  of
    the application.  If these failings  were  immaterial  they  would  not
    matter. However, they cannot be dismissed in this way.  As  the  resumï¿½
    in [3] above demonstrates, the core of the Appellant's case was that he
    would not be safe anywhere in his country of origin  and,  without  the
    slightest hint of illicit tactical manoeuvring or dubious invocation of
    the Tribunal's process, he was  inviting  a  course  of  action,  lying
    within the powers of the Tribunal, designed to fortify and enhance  his
    case.  Further analysis is unnecessary.

 6. An error of law has unmistakably been  committed  and  we  consider  it
    indisputably material  since,  had  it  been  avoided,  the  effect  of
    granting an adjournment could (this being the relevant  standard)  have
    resulted in the generation of evidence which could  have  achieved  the
    Appellant's objective, namely persuading the FtT not to follow  HM  and
    Others - bearing in mind  in  this  context  paragraph  [11]  of  UTIAC
    Guidance Note No 2 of 2011 - and could, therefore,  have  succeeded  in
    his appeal.  The decision of the FtT cannot, therefore, be sustained.

 7. The further material factor to be noted is the recent  promulgation  of
    the new country guidance decision of the Upper Tribunal, in AA (Article
    15(c)) Iraq CG [2015] UKUT 00544 (IAC) which held, inter alia, that the
    Appellant's home Governorate of Diyala is in a state of internal  armed
    conflict. Accordingly, one of the issues, foreseeably, for the FtT will
    be that of internal relocation.

 8. Two further errors of law are canvassed in the grounds.  First,  it  is
    contended that the FtT erred in law in failing to address the issue  of
    the asserted duty on the Secretary of State  to  identify  a  point  of
    return to the country of origin and a route to the point of relocation,
    where appropriate, relying on AM (Evidence - Route of  Return)  Somalia
    [2011] UKUT 54 (IAC) and HH (Somalia) - v - Secretary of State for  the
    Home Department [2010] EWCA Civ 426.

 9. The final error of law canvassed on behalf of the Appellant is that the
    FtT, in considering the decision of the CJEU in Elgafagi  (Justice  and
    Home Affairs) [2009] EUECJ C - 465/07 in the context of  Article  15(c)
    of the Qualification Directive, did so "without any  proper  engagement
    with the new country background  material  that  the  Appellant  relies
    upon".

10. We draw  attention  to  these  further  errors  of  law,  which  it  is
    unnecessary for this Tribunal to determine, for  completeness  and,  in
    particular, to ensure that the issues which they raise,  if  considered
    material, are not overlooked by the FtT.

Decision

11. On the grounds and for the reasons elaborated above, we set  aside  the
    decision of the FtT.  Having regard to the nature of the main error  of
    law  identified,  remittal  to  a  differently   constituted   FtT   is
    appropriate.

12. We further direct that a case management hearing be convened as soon as
    convenient to the FtT and, preferably, not later than 01 March 2016.
