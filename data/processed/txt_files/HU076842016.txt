Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr C Nwadi, Counsel instructed by Nicholas
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant is a citizen of St Lucia born on  30  November  1977  who
    appeals against a decision of Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Coll who
    in a determination promulgated on 17 July  2017  dismissed  his  appeal
    against a decision of the Entry Clearance Officer made on  22  February
    2016 to refuse him entry clearance as the husband of Mrs Andrea Cooper-
    Mitchel, a British citizen born on 1 November 1982.
2.   The reason for refusing the decision was that  the  appellant  had  not
    produced the required documents under the  provisions  of  Appendix  FM
    with respect to paragraphs E-ECP1.1.(d) and E-ECP.3.1. which refers  to
    the specified gross annual income of �18,600 and also those  provisions
    of Appendix FM-SE which set  out  the  specified  documentary  evidence
    which must be established  to  show  that  the  financial  requirements
    indicating the salaried employment of the sponsor into  Britain  should
    be met.

3.   In the determination the judge set out the relevant  Immigration  Rules
    and considered the documentary evidence before her.  She noted that  it
    was argued that missing  bank  statements  had  been  provided  to  the
    Secretary of State but that these missing statements were  not  on  the
    Home Office file.  Having set out the burden of proof the judge set out
    her findings of fact in paragraph 16 onwards of the determination.

4.   In paragraph 18 of the determination she stated  that  she  found  that
    all the requirements of paragraph FM were met including  the  provision
    of payslips for the relevant period. In the previous paragraph she  had
    pointed out that the relevant period for the purposes of that  Appendix
    which was April 2015 to October 2015.

5.   In paragraph 19 of the determination the judge went  on  to  find  that
    she accepted that the sponsor was earning at least �22,699 plus  London
    Weighting at the date of application and concluded that it  was  likely
    that therefore when the application had been made the appellant  should
    have been  able  to  meet  the  financial  requirements.   However,  in
    paragraphs 20 onwards she pointed out  deficiencies  in  the  evidence.
    She noted these as follows:-

         "(1) The Employer's letter does not mention how  long  the  Sponsor
             has been in receipt of her level of salary (quoted as  �22,699
             plus London Weighting as at  17  May  2017).   The  letter  is
             silent on this and on whether she was in receipt of  a  salary
             in excess of �18,600 for the six month  period  (of  April  to
             October 2015).  Given her starting salary, it is highly likely
             that  she  was.   Nevertheless,  this  information  which   is
             supposed to be in the employer's letter is missing.


         (2)  The bank statements for the period  May  to  October  2015  in
             their entirety are missing.  The  bundle  contains  statements
             dated 27 October, 27 November and 24 December 2015  and  dated
             27 January and 26 February 2016.  There  are  thus  only  five
             months' of statements and the following five  relevant  months
             are missing: May 2015 to September 2015."

6.   She went on to find that the  further  information  placed  before  her
    contained identical information to that which had been  in  the  bundle
    and therefore the additional information submitted after the hearing by
    the appellant's representative did not resolve the  evidential  issues.
    She therefore found the financial requirements under Appendix  FM  were
    not met.

7.   Her conclusion therefore was that the decision of the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer was not undermined by the sponsor's evidence and therefore  the
    appellant had not discharged the burden  of  proof.   She  went  on  to
    dismiss the appeal under the Immigration Rules.

8.   The grounds of appeal which  are  handwritten  and  unclear  appear  to
    argue that relevant documentation had been submitted  or  alternatively
    that the decision of the judge  was  inconsistent  in  that  the  judge
    should have taken into account the sponsor's oral evidence and that the
    credibility of the sponsor was not taken into account and that that was
    itself irrational.

9.   Permission was granted in the First-tier by  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal  Hollingworth.   He  stated  in  his  decision  granting   the
    application that:-

         "2.  It is  arguable  that  given  the  evidence  of  the  Sponsor,
             together with  the  degree  of  corroboration  available  from
             documentary evidence that the level of  importance  attributed
             to the policy rationale underlying the provisions relating  to
             the financial requirements under Appendix FM, did not  require
             the Judge to reach the overall conclusion set out at paragraph
             22 of the decision.


         3.   It is arguable that the Judge  has  set  out  an  insufficient
             analysis at paragraph 23 of the decision  in  concluding  that
             the same conclusion is reached as that of the Entry  Clearance
             Officer.  The Judge states that the Entry Clearance  Officer's
             conclusions  had  not   been   undermined   by   the   Sponsor
             evidentially on the day of the hearing.


         4.   It is arguable that the Judge  has  set  out  an  insufficient
             analysis as to why, if at  all,  the  evidence  given  by  the
             Sponsor together with any corroborative  documentary  evidence
             did not enable the  burden  of  proof  to  be  discharged,  in
             contradistinction to the approach of considering  whether  the
             Entry Clearance Officer's  conclusions  had  been  undermined.
             The Judge has drawn the  conclusion  that  the  Appellant  had
             therefore  not  discharged  the  burden  of  proof  from   the
             immediately prior stated proposition that the Entry  Clearance
             Officer's conclusions had not been undermined by  the  Sponsor
             evidentially.   The  Judge  has  referred  to  the   Appellant
             therefore not discharging the burden of proof to show that  he
             could  comply  fully  with  the  relevant  Immigration   Rules
             applicable for entry into the United Kingdom.


         5.   It is unclear whether the Judge was  adhering  to  the  strict
             requirements as to the evidence to be provided in the  context
             of  the  financial  requirements,   as   opposed   to   making
             credibility findings as to the evidence given by  the  Sponsor
             in  considering  whether  the  burden  of   proof   had   been
             discharged."

10.  At the hearing before me Mr  Nwadi  accepted  that  in  any  event  the
    appellant had been caught by the provisions of Section 85 of  the  2002
    Act - he stated that the initial application had not been considered by
    his firm.  He said,  however,  that  I  should  adopt  the  credibility
    findings of the judge in that the judge had stated  that  she  accepted
    that the appellant met the financial requirements when the  application
    was made.  He argued that the judge had  contradicted  herself  because
    she had  stated  that  she  required  payslips  and  other  documentary
    evidence, when in fact she  accepted  that  the  sponsor  had  met  the
    relevant requirements.  He adopted the reasoning set out in  the  grant
    of permission.  Mr Tufan referred to the decision in SS (Congo)  [2015]
    EWCA Civ 387 at paragraph 51.  In that paragraph the  Court  of  Appeal
    had said that:-

     "In our judgment, the approach to Article 8 in the light of  the  Rules
         in Appendix  FM-SE  should  be  the  same  as  in  respect  of  the
         substantive LTE and LTR Rules in Appendix FM. In other  words,  the
         same general position applies, that compelling circumstances  would
         have to apply to justify a grant of LTE or LTR where  the  evidence
         Rules are not complied with."

11.  He went on to refer to the judgment in MM (Lebanon) & Ors  [2017]  UKSC
    10 stating that although that judgment in part overturned the  decision
    in  SS  (Congo)  it  did  not  overturn   the   requirement   for   the
    qualifications of the Rules to be met - the reason that the decision of
    the Court of Appeal was in part quashed in that case was that there had
    been insufficient argument to overturn the conclusion of the court that
    the sponsor could not return to the DRC with the appellant.

Discussion

12.  The reality appears to be that the appellant in  this  case  could  not
    meet the financial requirements of the Rules insofar as to  meet  those
    requirements specified documents were required and those had  not  been
    produced to the Entry Clearance Officer before the decision, nor indeed
    had they been put before the Immigration  Judge.   The  fact  that  the
    judge accepted that the income requirement was likely to have been  met
    when the application was made does not mean that she was  contradicting
    herself when she  found  that  the  specified  evidence  had  not  been
    produced.  She was therefore entitled to dismiss the appeal  under  the
    Rules.

13.  Although it does not appear to have been argued  before  the  judge  in
    the First-tier that the appeal should have been allowed on human rights
    grounds, that was clearly an underlying issue in the decision of  Judge
    Hollingworth to grant permission, and indeed  was  an  issue  that  was
    addressed by the representatives before me.  However, I find  there  is
    no breach of the Article 8 rights of  the  appellant.   I  have  quoted
    above the relevant paragraph of the Court of Appeal in SS (Congo).  The
    reality is that there are no compelling circumstances which would  lead
    to a grant of leave to enter.  I reach that conclusion because I see no
    reason why the applicant should not make a fresh application  with  all
    the relevant documentation, and indeed I see  no  reason  why  such  an
    application  should  not  be  successful.   This  is  not  a  Chikwamba
    situation in that there appears to be no reason why the  sponsor  could
    not live with the appellant in St Lucia, but be that as it may,  it  is
    clear that the judge accepted that it was  likely  that  the  financial
    requirements would be met and there has been no indication that it  was
    not accepted that this was a genuine  marriage.   I  see  therefore  no
    reason why  the  applicant  should  not  be  successful  in  a  further
    application and I would comment that it is unfortunate that this matter
    went to appeal rather than a fresh  application  being  made  when  the
    reasons for the refusal were considered.  I  would  add  that  while  I
    consider that the decision of the judge was fully open to her and  that
    her application of the law was correct I would hope that the ECO  might
    speedily deal with an application   containing all  necessary  evidence
    and, if  possible,  consider  the  waiving  of  the  fee  for  a  fresh
    application.

14.   For the above reasons I therefore  find  that  there  is  no  material
    error of law in the determination of the judge in the First-tier and  I
    find that her decision should stand.
