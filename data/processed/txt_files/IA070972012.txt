For the Appellant:     Mr H Patel, Legal Representative of Visa Limited
For the Respondent:    Mr G Saunders, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant, a citizen of India born  on  29  October  1985  appeals,
    with permission, against a determination of  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Levin who in  a  determination  promulgated  on  1  June  2012
    dismissed the appellant's appeal against a decision of the Secretary of
    State to refuse him an extension of stay under  the  Tier  4  (General)
    Student Rules.

2.   The reason for the refusal was  that  the  grant  of  leave  which  the
    appellant was seeking would lead to his having spent  more  than  three
    years in the UK as a Tier 4  Migrant  studying  courses  that  did  not
    consist of degree level study.  The appellant's  course  for  which  eh
    requested an extension of stay was below degree level.

3.   The notice of refusal of 6 March 2012 stated:-

         "Due to the fact that you have  previously  studied  a  Diploma  in
         Business Management at London College of  Accountancy  and  Finance
         from 15 September 2009 until  28  October  2011  and  your  current
         application is in respect of a course that is below  degree  level,
         NQF level 5 CIMA from 24 February 2012 until 28 February 2014,  the
         Secretary of State is not satisfied that a further period of  leave
         in this category can be granted."


4.   The grounds of appeal refer to the fact that the appellant had made  an
    application for a Tier 4 (General) Student visa and went on to say that
    he had initially been granted entry clearance to  study  a  Diploma  in
    Business Management from 15 September 2009 to 28  October  2011.   They
    stated:

         "At the  time  of  this  application  there  were  different  Rules
         applicable at the time.  At  that  time  there  was  no  such  Rule
         wherein students cannot be granted leave for more than 3  years  to
         study  below  degree  level  courses.   The  new  Rule   introduced
         regarding the maximum 3 years' stay was introduced around July 2011
         time. By this time I was nearly on  the  verge  of  finishing  this
         above-mentioned course.  Hence, I did not have enough time to  make
         any changes or even expedite my current course so as to be able  to
         take up some other course to match up for the new Rules."


5.   It was  argued that based on his qualifications "no reputed college  or
    institution" would have granted the appellant  admission  to  a  course
    above degree level and that  the  decision  was  in  violation  of  his
    "rights to fairness".  They  referred to a number  of  cases  including
    Thakur (PBS decision - common  law  fairness)  Bangladesh  [2011]  UKUT
    00151 (IAC) and Patel (revocation of sponsor licence - fairness)  India
    [2011] UKUT 00211 (IAC) and   asserted  that  the  appellant  had  been
    rejected  "on  the  basis  of  a  Rule  which  does  not  apply  to  my
    application".

6.   The appellant elected to have his appeal determined on the  papers  and
    in these circumstances it came before Judge Levin on 23 May 2012.

7.   Judge Levin noted the appellant's immigration history and the terms  of
    the notice of appeal.  He also referred to the terms of  paragraph  85A
    of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002  noting  the
    restricted evidence  which could be considered  by  him  in  an  appeal
    against an immigration decision.

8.   The Judge  noted that the change in the Rules had  taken  place  on  28
    November 2011 and that that was two months before  the  appellant  made
    the application.

9.   The Judge noted moreover that the confirmation of studies submitted  by
    the appellant stated the appellant had been accepted for an NQF level 5
    course at the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA)  and
    therefore found that it was below degree level.   With  regard  to  the
    section in the CAS headed "Course details" he noted that it stated  the
    appellant had successfully completed all  the  requirements  towards  a
    Diploma  in  Business  Management  which  according  to  the   National
    Qualifications Framework was a level 4 qualification and that therefore
    the appellant was eligible to progress to a level 5 qualification.   He
    stated therefore that it was clear that the appellant's previous course
    of study had also been below degree level.

10.  Having noted from the CAS the course  which  the  appellant  wished  to
    undertake lasted from February 2012 until 28  February  2014  he  found
    that the length of the course was just over four years and  that  given
    that the appellant had studied for  two  years  for  the  NVQ  level  4
    qualification, he found that the course  the  appellant  was  presently
    seeking to undertake would result in his having spent more  than  three
    years in Britain as a Tier 4 Migrant studying  courses  at  lower  than
    degree level.  He therefore found that the respondent had been  correct
    to refuse the application.

11.  He then considered the rights of the appellant under Article 8  of  the
    ECHR but concluded that the decision did not infringe  the  appellant's
    rights under Article 8 of the ECHR.

12.   The  grounds  of  appeal  in  the  Upper  Tribunal  argued  that   the
    qualification which the appellant  wished  to  take  consisted  of  NVQ
    levels 5, 6 and 7 and stated that to determine where  a  student  would
    start a qualification depended on the entry  requirement.   There  were
    different entry routes to the CIMA qualification and as  the  appellant
    had not qualified for exemption he had  to  start  at  level  5.   They
    argued in fact that the course which the appellant would be undertaking
    would incorporate levels 5 to 7, that  the  appellant  would  start  at
    level 5 which he expected to complete within six to nine  months.   The
    Immigration Judge was wrong, it was argued,  to conclude the  appellant
    would spend the entire duration of study at level 5 and that  he  would
    spend more than three years on courses that did not consist  of  degree
    level study.

13.  Permission to appeal was granted by  Judge  Vaudin  d'Imï¿½court  in  the
    First-tier Tribunal on 29 June 2012.  In September 2012 Upper  Tribunal
    Judge Chalkley, having noted that a witness statement and copies of  e-
    mails and documents had been submitted by the  appellant,  stated  that
    the appeal would be placed in a paper list as soon as  the  appellant's
    representatives confirmed that copies of all documents were sent to the
    respondent.  He stated that if no reply was received by 20 October 2012
    the matter would be set down for an oral hearing.

14.  No further documents having been served the appeal was set down for  an
    oral hearing before me on 3 September 2013.

15.  At the hearing of the appeal  Mr  Patel  referred  me  to  an  academic
    transcript from the London College of Accounting  and  Finance  stating
    that the appellant had passed a number  of  courses  between  September
    2009 and 28 October 2011.  He stated that they  were  evidence  of  the
    fact that the appellant had gained his  initial  qualification.   There
    was no other evidence of his qualification.

16.  He confirmed that the appellant had done nothing  since  finishing  his
    initial studies in November 2011 because the  appellant  had  not  been
    entitled to study as his application for extension of stay as a student
    had been refused.  He went on to argue that  the  CIMA  course  was  at
    levels 5, 6 and 7 and therefore part of the course was at degree level.
     He pointed out in a letter dated  17  October  2012  that  the  London
    International College of Management (where the appellant  had  intended
    to study) had been removed from the Register of the Sponsors for Tier 4
    and he was not sure whether the licence of the college had been revoked
    or suspended as that information was not available on the UKBA website.
     It is apparent that the college is now closed.  He referred to  papers
    from the CIMA website which set  out  the  "exemptions  policy"  and  a
    document referring to the structure of the  CIMA  qualification.   They
    had referred to the various papers which would need to be taken.

17.  Mr Saunders pointed out that the CAS did not indicate that  the  course
    was anything other than a level 5 course.

18.  I  have  considered  all  the  papers  before  me  and  of  course  the
    determination of the Immigration Judge.  It  would  only  have  been  a
    material error of law in the determination if  the  judge  had  ignored
    evidence which was before him or indeed in the grounds of  appeal.   It
    is of note that the grounds of appeal before the judge  did  not  argue
    that the course which the appellant wished to undertake was a course at
    degree level or indeed that part of the course  was  at  degree  level.
    Rather it was argued in the grounds  of  appeal  that  the  appellant's
    rights under Article 8 were infringed by  the  decision  and  that  the
    change in the Rules was unfair.

19.  It is only now that it has been argued that the course is  in  part  at
    degree level.  The reality is however that neither the  CAS  which  was
    submitted to the Home  Office  or  was  before  the  Immigration  Judge
    indicated that that was the case.  It clearly states that the course is
    for two years and the level is level 5.   The  structure  of  the  CIMA
    qualification which Mr Patel had downloaded from the website again does
    not state at what level the various parts of the qualification are.

20. I consider that the judge reached a clear and correct  decision  on  the
    basis of the evidence  before  him.   He  had  nothing  before  him  to
    indicate that the course which the appellant wished to undertake was at
    anything other than level 5.  It was not argued in the grounds of appal
    that the Judge had erred in his consideration of the Article  8  rights
    of the appellant.

21.  There was therefore no material error of law in the  determination  and
    the determination of the Immigration Judge shall therefore stand.

Decision
         This appeal is dismissed.
