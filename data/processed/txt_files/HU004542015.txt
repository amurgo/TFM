                            DECISION AND REASONS

Appeal history

     1. This is a remade appeal against the Respondent's decision of 26 May
        2015 refusing the Appellant's human rights claim which was based on
        her family life relationship with her husband, Mr  Cookson.  In  an
        error of law decision promulgated on 25 July 2017 I concluded  that
        the First-tier Tribunal's judge's (FtJ) decision, promulgated on 15
        November 2016 and dismissing the appeal, contained a material error
        of law. Although the FtJ had been entitled to conclude  that  there
        were no insurmountable obstacles to  the  Appellant's  relationship
        with her husband continuing in Jamaica,  his  conclusion  that  the
        claim did not merit consideration outside of the immigration  rules
        was one he was not legally entitled to reach.  The  FtJ  failed  to
        consider whether any temporary return by the  Appellant  to  enable
        her to make an  entry  clearance  application  could  constitute  a
        disproportionate interference with the article 8 relationship  even
        if there were no insurmountable  obstacles  to  family  life  being
        enjoyed in Jamaica (R (on the application of Chen) v  Secretary  of
        State for the Home Department (Appendix FM - Chikwamba -  temporary
        separation - proportionality) IJR [2015] UKUT 00189 (IAC), headnote
        (i)). Despite this submission having been prominently made  in  the
        skeleton argument the FtJ failed to consider whether the  Appellant
        fell within the terms of the Chikwamba  [2008]  UKHL  40  principle
        (i.e., whether, but  for  her  immigration  status,  she  would  be
        certain to  be  granted  leave  to  enter  if  an  entry  clearance
        application was made, a factor which, if  holistically  considered,
        'might' mean there was no public interest in requiring her to leave
        the UK - see Agyarko  [2017]  UKSC  11,  at  [51]).  There  was  no
        consideration by the FtJ as to whether the financial and evidential
        requirements of Appendix FM and Appendix FM-SE were met (the  large
        bundle of documents before the FtJ contained evidence  relating  to
        Mr Cookson's employment as an English teacher with an annual salary
        of �36,906), or of the Respondent's acceptance that  the  Appellant
        met the  Suitability  requirements,  or  that,  as  a  national  of
        Jamaica,  she  was  exempt  from  requiring  any   English-language
        certificate.


     2. There were, in addition, a number of other factors, not included in
        the  FtJ's  assessment  under  the  immigration  rules,  which,  if
        cumulatively considered, may have had some bearing on an assessment
        outside of the immigration rules. These included the nature of  the
        Appellant's relationship with her son as well as her grandson,  the
        fact that the Appellant resided in the UK for  15  years,  and  the
        substantial number of letters in support indicating the  extent  to
        which she had integrated. Nor was there any clear consideration  of
        the factors contained in s.117B of the Nationality, Immigration and
        Asylum Act 2002. Having holistic regard to these  factors  I  could
        not be satisfied that, but for the FtJ's failure to  engage  in  an
        assessment outside of  the  immigration  rules,  the  appeal  would
        inevitably have fallen for dismissal.

     3. Having uncovered a material error of law I was invited  to  adjourn
        the matter to enable further evidence to be adduced relating to the
        nature and quality of the Appellant's relationships in the UK,  her
        relationship with her son, and to consider the provision of further
        financial  evidence.  The  FtJ's  finding  that   there   were   no
        insurmountable  obstacles  to  the  Appellant   and   her   husband
        relocating to Jamaica was not vitiated by  any  legal  error.  This
        finding would stand. The  matter  was  adjourned  to  consider  the
        narrow issue of whether it would be disproportionate to expect  the
        Appellant  to  return  to  Jamaica  to  make  an  entry   clearance
        application,  and  whether  she  could  otherwise  succeed  in   an
        assessment outside the immigration rules.

   Factual Background


     4. The Appellant is a national of Jamaica, date of birth 26 June 1971.
        There is some confusion as to her early  immigration  history.  The
        Respondent notes that the Appellant was issued with a visitor entry
        clearance on 10 June 2000, valid until December 2000. Although  not
        referenced  in  the  Reasons  For  Refusal  Letter  the   Appellant
        maintains that she returned to Jamaica  on  6  July  2000  and  re-
        entered the United Kingdom on 10 March 2001 with leave valid  until
        September 2001. The Appellant was, in any event, granted  leave  to
        remain as a student  on  18  June  2002,  and  thereafter  received
        subsequent grants of  leave  to  remain.  On  24  April  2007,  the
        Appellant applied for further leave to remain as  a  student.  This
        was refused on 16 May 2007. She was accorded a right of appeal  but
        her appeal was struck out on  14  September  2007.  Thereafter  the
        Appellant remained in the country without lawful  leave.  She  made
        several applications for leave to remain including one made  on  29
        August 2013 as the spouse of a person  settled  in  the  UK.  These
        applications were all refused. On 20 May 2015, the Appellant made a
        human rights claim  based  on  her  marital  relationship  with  Mr
        Anthony Cookson and her medical condition. They met online in  2008
        and their relationship commenced in 2009. They were  married  on  6
        July 2013 and have lived together from that date.


     5. In her decision dated 26 May 2015 the Respondent accepted that  the
        Appellant met the Suitability requirements of Appendix FM and  that
        she  met  the  Eligibility  requirements   of   Appendix   FM   (R-
        LTRP.1.1.(d)(ii) with the exception of EX.1. The Respondent was not
        satisfied that there were 'insurmountable obstacles' to family life
        with her partner continuing outside the UK.  The  Respondent  noted
        that Mr Cookson had Jamaican heritage as he was born in Jamaica and
        lived there until the age of 35. The Respondent was  not  satisfied
        that he would have lost all social and cultural ties to Jamaica  or
        that there would be any language barrier preventing his return. The
        Respondent went on  to  consider  whether  the  Appellant  met  the
        requirements of paragraph  276ADE  of  the  immigration  rules  but
        concluded that there would be no 'very  significant  obstacles'  to
        her re-integration given the length of time she  lived  in  Jamaica
        (28 years) and in the absence of any evidence that she had lost all
        social and cultural ties with her country of nationality.

Further evidence

     6. In addition to the bundle of documents that was before  the  First-
        tier  Tribunal,  the  Appellant  relies  on  a  further  bundle  of
        documents prepared for the error of law hearing on  13  July  2017.
        This includes a number of character references relating to both her
        and her husband, and some further medical documents dating back  to
        2015,  2016  and  2017  relating  to   the   gastroenterology   and
        gynaecological problems,


     7.  The  Appellant  produced  a  supplementary   bundle   (Bundle   B)
        containing, inter alia, a  further  statement  from  her  dated  21
        August 2017, statements from her son (Jevone Robinson) and daughter-
        in-law (Tamara Robinson) dated 22 August 2017, a  letter  from  the
        Penrhyn Surgery dated 11 August 2017, wage slips  relating  to  her
        husband's (Anthony Cookson) employment as a  teacher  covering  the
        period  from  January  2017  to  July   2017   and   Mr   Cookson's
        corresponding bank account statements reflecting the monthly  wage.
        There was also background evidence relating to health provision  in
        Jamaica taken from, amongst others, a Home Office COI report  dated
        January 2013, Foreign Office advice  on  travel  to  Jamaica,  some
        details of  hospitals  in  Jamaica,  information  relating  to  the
        National Health Fund (NHF) card, and advice from  the  US  Jamaican
        embassy in respect of medical assistance.

     8. In her additional statement the Appellant reiterated that  she  had
        lived in the UK for over 16 years and had embraced the British  way
        of life. She described the course of the previous studies. Her  son
        had entered the UK at the age  of  12  in  December  2002  and  the
        Appellant couldn't see her life without him. The Appellant now  had
        a grandson who would be turning 3 in October and with whom she  had
        a good relationship. She was expecting the birth of a granddaughter
        early in the same month. Her son also had 2 stepchildren who adored
        the Appellant. The Appellant's son and wife were dependent  on  the
        Appellant to help with babysitting. Although the Appellant and  her
        son's mother-in-law took it in turns to act as babysitter,  due  to
        the mother-in-law's husband's long-term illness the Appellant spent
        more time with  the  grandchildren.  Witness  statements  from  the
        Appellant's son and daughter-in-law confirmed that they all enjoyed
        a good relationship, that their son adored the Appellant,  that  it
        was good to have the Appellant around to help bring  up  their  son
        and that the Appellant could always be  depended  upon  to  babysit
        even at short notice.


     9. Oral evidence was taken only  from  the  Appellant.  There  was  no
        examination-in-chief. In cross-examination, the Appellant confirmed
        that her husband was aware of  her  precarious  immigration  status
        when their relationship began. When asked why the  Appellant  could
        not return to Jamaica to make an entry clearance application, which
        was likely to take between 1 and 3 months, the  Appellant  said  it
        was as a result of her medical issues. She didn't know  what  could
        happen to her and needed to be close to the gastroenterology  team.
        She had a severe issue with her bowels and attended  A&E  in  April
        2017 because her stomach was blocked. As a result of this  incident
        an appointment was brought forward from 2018 to November 2017.  The
        Appellant described the challenging time she experienced in 2012 as
        a result of her gastroenterological problems. The Appellant had not
        made  any  enquiries  in  relation  to  the   treatment   for   her
        gastroenterological problems in  Jamaica.  The  Appellant  and  her
        husband rented a one-bedroom flat. He was an English teacher.  When
        asked whether she had  investigated  any  precautions  against  the
        possibility of developing Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) the  Appellant
        said she had not. The Appellant confirmed  she  developed  a  blood
        clot in her lungs in 2012. The Appellant had not made any enquiries
        as to whether treatment for this was available in Jamaica.


    10. When asked in re-examination why she could not  return  to  Jamaica
        for a brief period of time in order to make an application  to  re-
        enter the UK the Appellant said her daughter-in-law was due to give
        birth in early October 2017. Her  daughter-in-law  had  gestational
        diabetes and the daughter-in-law's father was  in  a  nursing  home
        with dementia and Parkinson's disease. The Appellant had to help as
        much as possible. The Appellant  acted  as  a  babysitter  for  her
        grandson as her son was a bus driver. The Appellant  did  not  know
        how her son's family would cope if she had  to  leave  the  UK  for
        short period of time. She had investigated how long entry clearance
        applications usually took and believed a  spousal  entry  clearance
        application would take about 90 days.


    11. I heard submissions from both representatives which are recorded in
        my record of proceedings. Having  considered  the  letter  from  Mr
        Cookson's employer  and  the  requirements  of  Appendix  FM-SE  in
        respect of such a letter I permitted the Appellant to provide a new
        letter of employment within 10 days of the hearing (expiring on  29
        September 2017). In the event I received no further  evidence  from
        the Appellant.

Discussion


    12. (R (on the application of Chen) v Secretary of State for  the  Home
        Department (Appendix  FM  -  Chikwamba  -  temporary  separation  -
        proportionality) IJR [2015] UKUT 00189 (IAC) states  that  Appendix
        FM does not include consideration of the question whether it  would
        be disproportionate to expect an individual to return to their home
        country to make an entry clearance application. In Chen  the  Upper
        Tribunal found that there may  be  cases  in  which  there  are  no
        insurmountable obstacles to family life being enjoyed  outside  the
        UK but where temporary separation to enable an individual  to  make
        an application for entry clearance may  be  disproportionate  under
        article 8. It was submitted on behalf  of  the  Appellant  that  it
        would be disproportionate to expect her to return to Jamaica for  a
        temporary  period  to  make  an  entry  clearance  application   in
        circumstances where she met all the requirements of the immigration
        rules.


    13. At the resumed hearing, I considered  the  financial  documentation
        provided in relation to Mr Cookson's employment at the  Lee  Valley
        high school. Mr Armstrong indicated there was no  reason  to  doubt
        the reliability of the wage  slips  or  the  Halifax  bank  account
        statements showing the salary deposits. The Appellant provided wage
        slips relating to her husband dating from January 2017 to July 2017
        inclusive. The Halifax bank  statements  relating  to  Mr  Cookson,
        covering the same period, showed regular deposits into his  account
        matching those contained on the salary slips.


    14. To fulfil the requirements of Appendix  FM  -  SE  the  Appellant's
        partner must  additionally  provide  a  letter  from  his  employer
        containing certain prescribed information. The only letter from the
        Appellant's husband's employer (Lee Valley high school) is dated  8
        September 2016. This confirms that  Mr  Anthony  Cookson  has  been
        employed by the school since 1 April 2016 as a teacher  of  English
        and that his salary is �36,906. The letter does not give the period
        over which Mr Cookson has been paid this level of  salary,  or  the
        type of employment (e.g. permanent, fixed-term contract or agency).
        This information is required by Appendix FM-SE. In the  absence  of
        this information I gave the Appellant 10 days in which to provide a
        new employment letter from Mr Cookson's school containing  all  the
        relevant information required by Appendix FM - SE. By 4pm on Friday
        the 29 September 2017 I had received  no  further  evidence.  After
        making enquiries on Monday 2 October 2017 I was informed by Ms Reid
        that Haq Hamilton solicitors had ceased acting  for  the  Appellant
        and a notice to that effect had been sent to the  Tribunal  on  the
        morning of  2  October  2017.  Ms  Reid  stated  that  it  was  the
        understanding of the solicitors that no further evidence  would  be
        forthcoming. Ms Reid reminded me that the Appellant  was  aware  of
        the deadline for further evidence having been in the  hearing  room
        and having been reminded of it by Haq Hamilton solicitors who  also
        provided her with the Tribunal's email address. A letter  from  Haq
        Hamilton solicitors was received by the Upper Tribunal on 2 October
        2017  confirming  that  they  were  no  longer  instructed  by  the
        Appellant.


    15. Appendix FM-SE  requires  a  letter  from  the  sponsor's  employer
        confirming, inter alia, the period over which the sponsor has  been
        paid his stated level of salary, and the type of  employment  (e.g.
        permanent,  fixed-term  contract   or   agency).   This   specified
        information has not been  provided,  despite  the  Appellant  being
        given a sufficient opportunity to produce a new employer's  letter.
        No explanation has been provided for the failure to provide the new
        employer's letter. The requirements of Appendix FM-SE have not been
        met.  In  a  national  entry  clearance   application   under   the
        immigration  rules  the  Appellant  would  not  be  granted   entry
        clearance  because  the  required  information  in   Mr   Cookson's
        employer's letter has not been provided. In the  circumstances,  it
        cannot be said that, but for her immigration status, the  Appellant
        would be certain to  be  granted  entry  clearance.  The  principal
        enunciated in Chikwamba [2008] UKHL 40 only has  application  if  a
        notional entry clearance application would be certain to be granted
        (see Agyarko [2017] UKSC 11). She does not  therefore  fall  within
        the parameters of the Chikwamba principle.


    16. Even if the Appellant was certain to meet all the requirements in a
        notional entry  clearance  application,  there  is  nothing  in  my
        judgment to render it disproportionate to expect her to  return  to
        Jamaica for a brief period while she makes an  application  to  re-
        enter the United Kingdom. In Chen, Upper Tribunal Judge Gill stated
        (at [39]), "In my judgement, if it is shown by an  individual  (the
        burden being upon  him  or  her)  that  an  application  for  entry
        clearance from abroad would be granted  and  that  there  would  be
        significant interference with family life by temporary removal, the
        weight to be accorded to the formal requirement of obtaining  entry
        clearance is reduced."


    17. The Appellant claimed that her son and daughter-in-law and grandson
        could not do without her because she provided invaluable assistance
        babysitting their young child. This was in large part  because  the
        mother of the Appellant's daughter-in-law was not in a  good  state
        of health herself and had to care for her husband who suffered from
        dementia and Parkinson's disease. I note however from the  evidence
        that the daughter-in-law's father resides in a care home. Moreover,
        other than statements from the Appellant's son and  daughter-in-law
        there is no independent evidence confirming the nature or  severity
        of the daughter-in-law's father's condition, or indeed any evidence
        relating to  the  health  of  the  daughter-in-law's  mother.  Even
        accepting these assertions at face  value,  there  is  insufficient
        evidence to support the Appellant's claim that she is the only  one
        who can provide the necessary childcare.  Neither  the  Appellant's
        son nor her daughter-in-law gave oral evidence at the  hearing  and
        there was therefore no opportunity to test their written  evidence.
        I find it hard to believe that there is absolutely no other support
        available  from  any  other  source  to  babysit  the   Appellant's
        grandchild. The Appellant has not persuaded me, on the  balance  of
        probabilities, that alternative childcare  arrangements  cannot  be
        made for a temporary period while she returns to Jamaica and  makes
        an entry clearance application. There was no  independent  evidence
        that the  relationship  between  the  Appellant  and  her  son  and
        daughter-in-law and grandchild  contained  any  elements  over  and
        above those normally to be expected in such relationships.  Nor  is
        there any reason why the Appellant could not stay either  with  her
        family or friends or relatives, or rent property for a  short  time
        while she makes the entry clearance application.


    18. Although there is no evidence of the Appellant's visit  to  A&E  in
        April 2017 the GP's letter dated 11 August 2017 does refer  to  her
        ongoing treatment in hospital relating to her bowel  condition  and
        that her next appointment, which was scheduled for the 21  February
        2018, was expedited to 29 November 2017 due to complications. There
        is however no further medical evidence describing  the  seriousness
        of the Appellant's gastroenterological condition and  whether  this
        renders her unfit to travel. Nor is there  any  evidence  that  the
        Appellant's condition cannot be  treated  in  Jamaica.  Whilst  the
        background documents provided  by  the  Appellant  identifies  many
        hospitals in Jamaica there is nothing produced specifically stating
        that she would be unable to receive any treatment in respect of her
        gastroenterology problems.


    19. The letter from the Appellant's GP at  Penrhyn  surgery,  dated  11
        August 2017,  confirmed  that  the  Appellant  had  an  episode  of
        pulmonary embolism (blood clot) in 2012 which required warfarin and
        anticoagulation treatment. The letter  stated  that  the  Appellant
        remains at risk for a subsequent episode of  DVT  and  that  flying
        long distance at high altitude is  a  known  high-risk  factor  for
        developing DVT, which can lead to a potentially  fatal  lung  clot.
        The letter did not actually say that the  Appellant  was  unfit  to
        fly. There was no assessment of  the  nature  of  the  risk  for  a
        subsequent  episode  of  DVT.  Nor  did  the  letter  identify  any
        precautions that could be taken by the Appellant  to  minimise  the
        threat of DVT. When asked why she could not return  to  Jamaica  to
        make an entry clearance application the Appellant referred  to  her
        gastroenterological  problems  but  made  no   reference   to   the
        possibility of DVT occurring. There does not appear  to  have  been
        any issue of pulmonary embolism since 2012. In the absence  of  any
        enquiries by the Appellant as to whether she can minimise the risks
        of DVT on a plane flight to Jamaica, and  in  the  absence  of  any
        reference in the GP's letter to the Appellant being unfit to travel
        because of her previous pulmonary embolism and the current risk  of
        any such embolism occurring, I am not  satisfied  that  she  cannot
        reasonably be expected to travel by plane to Jamaica.


    20. The first-tier  Tribunal  judge's  assessment  in  respect  of  the
        absence of insurmountable obstacles to family  life  relocating  to
        Jamaica has not been challenged. For the reasons given above  I  do
        not regard it  as  disproportionate  to  expect  the  Appellant  to
        relocate to Jamaica if  she  wishes  to  make  an  entry  clearance
        application to join her husband in the  UK.  I  will  now  consider
        whether there are any other compelling circumstances outside of the
        immigration  rules  that  could  render  her  return   to   Jamaica
        disproportionate.


    21.  I  have  considered  the  factors  identified  in  s.117B  of  the
        Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002.  I  note  that  the
        maintenance of effective immigration  controls  is  in  the  public
        interest. I accept that the Appellant is a  person  who  can  speak
        English and I am prepared to accept that she is  a  person  who  is
        capable of being financially independent. These however are neutral
        factors in  the  overall  proportionality  assessment  (Rhuppiah  v
        Secretary of State for the Home Department [2016] EWCA Civ 803,  at
        [59] to [62]). I must give little weight to a  relationship  formed
        with a qualifying partner that is established at a  time  when  the
        person was in the UK  unlawfully.  It  is  not  disputed  that  the
        Appellant's relationship with Mr  Cookson  commenced  when  she  no
        longer had any lawful  right  to  reside.  Although  the  Appellant
        clearly gets on well with her son and  daughter-in-law  nothing  in
        the evidence presented to me, including the  statements,  indicates
        there is any relationship between them sufficient  to  trigger  the
        protection of article 8 (Singh and Khalid [2015] EWCA Civ 74). I am
        not satisfied there is anything  more  than  the  normal  emotional
        bonds  between  adult  children  and  their  parents.  Whilst   the
        Appellant  provides  some  childcare  to  her  grandson  there   is
        insufficient evidence to persuade me that  alternative  babysitting
        cannot be arranged.  While  the  definition  of  "family  life"  in
        Article 8 is broad enough to include the ties between  grandparents
        and  grandchildren  (Marckx  v.  Belgium   [1979]   ECHR   2)   the
        relationship between grandparents and grandchildren,  by  its  very
        nature, generally calls for a lesser degree of protection than that
        between natural parents and their children (G.H.B. v UK Application
        no. 42455/98). There is nothing in the evidence  to  indicate  that
        the  relationship  between  the  Appellant  and  her  grandson   is
        sufficient to trigger the protection of article 8. Although it  may
        be in the grandson's best interests, as considered pursuant to s.55
        of the Borders, Citizenship  and  Immigration  Act  2009,  for  the
        Appellant to remain in the  UK,  he  nevertheless  lives  with  his
        parents who provide for his care and welfare. Having regard to  the
        public interest in immigration control, coupled with the Appellants
        unlawful residence in the UK since 2007  and  the  absence  of  any
        insurmountable   obstacles   preventing   the   relationship   from
        continuing in  Jamaica,  I  am  not  satisfied  that  it  would  be
        disproportionate to expect the Appellant to relocate to Jamaica. If
        the Appellant is not granted entry clearance there  is  nothing  to
        indicate that contact between her and her son and grandchild  would
        be severed. This could continue through remote  forms  as  well  as
        periodic visits. Although Mr Cookson has a job in the UK it was not
        suggested that he would be unable to look for employment in Jamaica
        or that he  or  the  Appellant  would  be  unable  to  find  rental
        accommodation in the country. As has  already  been  found  by  the
        first-tier judge the Appellant has a number of  qualifications  and
        has previously worked in Jamaica. I take into account the fact that
        the Appellant has lived in the UK for 16 years, and  that  she  has
        established a private life in this country  (as  evidenced  by  the
        various letters of support), but she  has  not  had  permission  to
        reside here since 2007and there is no  reason  why  she  could  not
        continue to maintain her friendships, albeit  by  remote  forms  of
        communication.


    22. Having considered all these factors  'in  the  round',  and  having
        weighed up the public  interest  factors  against  the  Appellant's
        particular circumstances and the relationships she has  established
        in the  UK,  I  am  satisfied  that  the  decision  to  refuse  the
        Appellant's human rights  claim  does  constitute  a  proportionate
        interference with article 8.
