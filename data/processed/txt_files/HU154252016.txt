Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms A Vatish, instructed by Chancery Solicitors.
For the Respondent:    Mr P Deller, Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant was granted permission to appeal a determination of First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Oliver, which dismissed the appellant's appeal,  on
    human rights grounds, against a decision  of  the  Secretary  of  State
    dated 6th June 2016.

Application for Permission to Appeal


 2. The application for permission  made  contended  the  judge  materially
    erred in concluding that the appellant failed to meet  requirements  of
    'humanitarian protection under article 3' (sic) of the ECHR, and  erred
    in refusing the appellant's appeal by stating  the  appellant  did  not
    meet the requirements  of  paragraph  276  ADE.   The  judge  erred  in
    applying the incorrect test as to whether there were  very  significant
    obstacles for the appellant integrating into India. The judge failed to
    take into  consideration  the  fact  that  the  ruling  party  BJP  had
    significantly threatened the appellant. The judge  had  not  considered
    the appellant's online activities and the political associations.

 3. Further, the  judge  did  not  acknowledge  the  appellant's  extensive
    private and family life in the UK. The reasons given by the  respondent
    in her refusal letter were generic in nature and did  not  justify  the
    interference with his rights.

 4. The judge erred in determining that it would  not  be  disproportionate
    for  the  appellant  to  be  returned.  The   appellant   had   clearly
    demonstrated his article 3 human rights.

 5.  The judge failed to apply the principle  of  common  law  fairness  as
    established in Naved and Thakur (common law fairness) [2011] UKUT 00151
    (IAC).  There should be a fair system and it should be operated fairly.
    The requirements of furnace were set out in R v Home Secretary ex Doody
    [1994] IAC 531.

The Hearing


 6. At the hearing, Ms Vatish advanced that the  judge  had  conflated  his
    findings and had not taken into account all relevant  factors.  Further
    he had not applied Section  117.   Ms  Vatish  relied  on  her  written
    submissions.

 7. Mr Deller's  position  was  that  there  was  nothing  wrong  with  the
    decision.  The evidence came nowhere close to establishing real risk on
    Article 3 grounds and the appellant could  not  succeed  on  Article  8
    grounds.    The errors asserted were not present.

Conclusions


 8. There is no requirement for formulaic adherence to the Razgar test.  To
    state merely that the judge erred in failing to find that the appellant
    did not meet the requirements of article 3  or  paragraph  276  ADE  is
    essentially a disagreement with the decision.

 9. The judge clearly set out at paragraph 2, the nature of the appellant's
    claim that he was oppressed by the ruling BJP party, and,  that  if  he
    returned the money and time he had spent UK would be in vain. On return
    he claimed, he would be subjected to torture or inhuman  and  degrading
    treatment contrary to article 3 since he had written  on  Facebook  and
    other social media against the genocide by the BJP party in Gujarat. It
    was also asserted that he had physical complaints and illnesses and was
    in the middle of receiving treatment

10. The judge recorded the detail of the Secretary of State's refusal  that
    the evidence submitted was  limited  to  six  printed  pages  from  his
    Facebook account and his social media post and all  the  responses  had
    been made 2 days prior to the appellant submitting his application  for
    further leave in September 2015. Indeed, one of the responses was  from
    his Facebook friends. There was no evidence that his  family  had  been
    targeted [4].

11. The judge identified there was no application for asylum and indeed the
    appellant had made a choice  between  that  and  pursuing  his  current
    appeal on compassionate grounds [6]. This  was  despite  the  appellant
    assessing that in 2011 that he had been nearly attacked by the BJP  and
    in the light of this his family had to live in hiding.  The judge noted
    the appellant claimed 'he was a member of the National  Congress  party
    and his writings were so influential that thousands of people  followed
    his regular activities and shared his political opinion' [7].

12. Despite detailing the respondent's refusal the judge did  not  fail  to
    assess the evidence independently. At [8] the judge wrote this

      `'in oral evidence  he  said  that  after  becoming  involved  in  the
      National Congress party in India his involvement in the United Kingdom
      had been through  social  media  on  Facebook  in  Hindi.  He  started
      blogging but had to close it down because of the threats he  received,
      which were affecting his studies. The threats had forced his family to
      move to live with friends. Asked  what  fear  he  had  on  return,  he
      answered that, first, you would not get a job  as  he  was  unable  to
      complete  his  studies,  and  secondly,  he  would  be  targeted.  The
      targeting would take the form of mental and possibly physical violence
      and he would not have a stable life. Although he  had  studied  for  5
      years  he  had  been  tricked  by  the  college  to  enrolling  in  an
      unnecessary foundation year in science and engineering  will  stop  he
      had completed that with good grades and  then  enrolled  on  the  BTEC
      Marine engineering course, supposed to be  a  three-year  course,  but
      during his 2nd year he suffered from insomnia and  depression  because
      of the family problems. He did not go  to  the  doctor  and  it  would
      probably have been better if he had. Because he had to reset  some  of
      his second-year course, he had to redo the whole year. It was his  4th
      year in the United Kingdom but only his third year of the BTEC in  the
      following year suffered from stress when the current ruling  party  in
      India came to power stop as a result he could  not  finish  his  final
      year'.

13. Critically at paragraph 9, as recorded, the judge specifically reminded
    the appellant that it was a human rights appeal and asked  him  why  he
    should be allowed to stay, and the appellant explained, emphasising his
    desire to complete his studies rather than the risk at home

     'that it was in order to finish his studies and, after so  many  years
    in the United Kingdom, he would not feel comfortable back home. He  had
    spent about ï¿½50,000 on his studies and owed a debt to his  parents.  If
    he went back now, he would not be a respected man

14. Under cross  examination  the  appellant  explained  that  he  had  not
    reported the threats he received to the police in  India  because  they
    were

      "not that serious; they were society  threats.  His  family  had  been
      boycotted from cultural stuff and were basically abandoned'.

15. Not only was there a lack of evidence but on his own evidence, in  this
    respect, the appellant's claim could not succeed under Article 3.

16. The judge at paragraph 15 of  his  conclusions  clearly  addressed  the
    point that the appellant  did  not  qualify  on  the  grounds  of  long
    residence that is 10 years residence under paragraph 276B and could not
    qualify on the basis of paragraph 276 ADE  (20  years  residence).  The
    judge directed himself in law appropriately with his  consideration  of
    Agyarko v SSHD [2017] UKSC 11 and whether  the  decision/removal  would
    result in unjustifiably harsh circumstances. It was  evident  that  the
    appellant's parents remained in India and his father continued to run a
    small business [12], and that the appellant had lived for the  majority
    of his life (18 years) in India and had been educated there. The  judge
    clearly  stated  that  the  appellant  did  not  meet  any   compelling
    circumstances which outweighed the public interest in maintaining  firm
    and fair immigration rules and at paragraph 16,  bearing  in  mind  the
    appellant had not claimed asylum, the judge considered the evidence  in
    relation to his political reasons for wishing to remain.

17. The  judge,  unarguably  rationally,  relied  on  the  appellant's  own
    evidence who argued that his profile  came  from  his  following  as  a
    result of his blog, but the judge concluded with adequate reasons that

      'the evidence he submitted was woefully short  of  establishing  this
      and his blog has been taken down in any event. He was given the choice
      of making an asylum claim when his hearing was  adjourned  previously,
      despite making clear that he understands what an asylum  claim  is  he
      has not chosen formally to do so and has in any event not provided any
      evidence beyond the very limited evidence of his social media blogging
      to establish any basis for fear of persecution on return will.  He has
      simply not forwarded an arguable case to be considered'.

18. Although in relation to article 3 the fact that  corroboration  is  not
    required does not mean an immigration judge is required to leave out of
    account the absence of documentary evidence which might  reasonably  be
    expected, ST (Corroboration - Kasolo) Ethiopia [2004] UKIATT.  In  this
    instance, it was the appellant's case that his blog put him at risk and
    yet failed to provide adequate evidence of such when it was  reasonable
    to expect him to do so.

19. The judge also observed at paragraph 17 and was critical  of  the  oral
    evidence as follows:

      'During the hearing the appellant shifted his focus  to  his  need  to
      continue his studies in order to complete his  degree,  to  repay  his
      debt, to avoid returning on respected and to secure good employment on
      his return. He has not established any unfairness of  the  application
      of the five-year study for his Degree. He has not explained how he was
      tricked by his college into accepting an unnecessary year-long  course
      and his failure to complete his 2nd year because of  illness  has  not
      been supported by any medical evidence'.

20. Even with regards Article 3 it is for  the  appellant  to  provide  the
    evidence to prove his case. The judge found the appellant had not  done
    so for the reasons given.  With regard to Article 8 as  set  out  in  R
    (Kaur) [2018] EWCA Civ 1423, the  test  with  regard  very  significant
    obstacles (or insurmountable obstacles) is a stringent and exacting one
    and it is incumbent upon the appellant to provide evidence
      56.   ....In the recent case of R (Mudibo) v SSHD [2017] EWCA Civ 1949
        this court has emphasised the distinction, in this context, between
        evidence and mere assertion. The facts and  decision  in  Jeunesse,
        referred to by Lord Reed in the passages which I have quoted above,
        show how high the bar is set.
    60. It follows that in my judgment, the SSHD's first ground  of  appeal
        succeeds: Mrs Kaur had not put forward anything more  than  a  bare
        and insufficient assertion of  insurmountable  obstacles,  and  the
        Deputy Judge was  wrong  to  find  that  the  SSHD's  decision  was
        vitiated by a failure to give proper consideration to  this  issue.
        It was not irrational or unreasonable for the SSHD to  decide  that
        there were no insurmountable obstacles to Mrs  Kaur  and  Mr  Singh
        continuing their family life in India.

        ...

61. Essentially this was an appellant  who  had  not  claimed  asylum,  not
    provided evidence to establish his article 3 claim on the basis of  his
    blogging, relied on mere assertion and changed the focus of his  appeal
    during his oral evidence. He was a young man of 28 years who had failed
    to provide evidence that his failure to complete his degree was because
    of medical issues [17] and had grown  up  in  India  and  retained  his
    family there [12].  The judge rightly considered  this  appeal  through
    the lens of the immigration rules.  There was a  challenge  during  the
    hearing before me on the basis that  the  judge  had  failed  to  apply
    section 117B of the Nationality Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002.  The
    context of this matter, as the judge was fully apprised, was  that  the
    appellant was a 26-year-old Indian man born on 3 March 1992 who arrived
    in the United Kingdom on 25 September 2010 with Tier 4  student  leave.
    His leave was extended to 29 September 2015 and  since  that  date  has
    been extended by virtue of  section  3C.  His  leave  was  thus  always
    precarious. That is the context in which the appellant's appeal was  to
    be considered and there was no indication that the judge was not  aware
    of the status of the appellants leave. The judge did  not  specifically
    cite Section 117 but at [18] factored in that

      'his stay  in  the  United  Kingdom  has  always  been  temporary  and
      precarious and can have had no expectation of being permitted to  stay
      at the end of his studies'.

62. Any omission  of  Section  117  would  have  been  to  the  appellant's
    advantage but in fact this is a clear reference to Section 117  by  the
    judge.

63. The judge wove the various factors in throughout the decision  and  did
    not 'conflate' the issues.  He was bound to consider the evidence as  a
    whole and in the round with regard to Article 3 and did  so.   He  took
    into account the relevant factors for Article 8.  The  judge  correctly
    approached the balancing exercise in relation  to  proportionality  and
    the public interest, simply stating that the appellant had  'not  shown
    that he would face  insurmountable  obstacles  on  return  in  all  the
    circumstances'.  The judge cannot be criticised for writing a short but
    succinct decision  which  encapsulated  the  facts  and  gave  adequate
    reasoning.

64. As explained in Shizad (sufficiency of reasons: set aside) [2013]  UKUT
    00085 (IAC)


    'Although there is a legal duty to give  a  brief  explanation  of  the
    conclusions on the central issue on  which  an  appeal  is  determined,
    those reasons need not be extensive if the decision as  a  whole  makes
    sense, having regard to the material accepted by the judge'.

65. The decision does  not  ignore  the  principles  of  fairness  and  the
    challenge does not make out this ground.  As Doody states

      'the standards of fairness are not immutable. They may change with the
      passage of time, both  In  the  general  and  in  the  application  to
      decisions of the particular type. (3) the principles of  fairness  are
      not to be applied  by  wrote  identically  in  every  situation.  What
      fairness demands is dependent on the context of the decision and  this
      is to be taken into account in all aspects.... (5) Fairness will  very
      often require that a person who  may  be  adversely  affected  by  the
      decision will have an opportunity to make representations on  his  own
      behalf either before the decision is taken with a view to producing  a
      favourable result or after it is taken with a view  to  procuring  its
      modification or both'.

66.  There  is  no  question  that  the  appellant  was  not  afforded  the
    opportunity to make representations and indeed he attended the  hearing
    and was represented.

67. The decision contains no error of law and will stand.  The  appellant's
    appeal is dismissed.
