Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr G Musonza (Husband of Appellant)
For the Respondent:    Mr P Nath, a Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    The Appellant appeals against  the  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Thorne which was promulgated on 24th October 2017.  She had applied for
    entry clearance to join her husband here in the  United  Kingdom.   The
    Entry Clearance Officer had refused the application because it was said
    that there was insufficient evidence of the  Appellant  being  able  to
    meet the �18,600 a year requirement by her Sponsor.

2.    The judge dismissed the  appeal  and  said  amongst  other  things  as
    follows at paragraph 24 under the subheading of findings
         "I am satisfied that the Appellant failed to submit  to  the  Entry
         Clearance Officer the  required  evidence  to  establish  that  the
         Sponsor was earning �18,600 a year.  In particular (inter alia)  he
         did not submit the statement of account  (SA300  or  SA302),  self-
         employed registration, evidence of national insurance contributions
         and a  certificate  from  an  accountant  showing  he  is  properly
         registered as required under the Rules to  prove  his  income  from
         self-employment.  I conclude therefore that as at the time when the
         ECO made his decision the Appellant did not meet  the  requirements
         of the Immigration Rules."

3.    The Appellant sought permission with grounds which are  in  manuscript
    and it is right to say that the grounds are quite difficult to decipher
    and indeed to follow but in short, they say as follows:


         "(1)     Evidence of English test my wife  could  not  be  able  to
             apply for visa if she did not pass test  and  I  also  believe
             that the judge should have known this.


         (2)      The proof of earning more than �18,600 all  tax  documents
             from HMRC from 2015-2017 also evidence of me sending money  to
             my wife every month of which that money should be spent in the
             UK.


         (3)      I believe the judge should  know  better  than  I  do  the
             difference between social housing and housing associations and
             then there is reference to a one bedroom flat with appropriate
             bathroom and kitchen  facilities.   The  grounds  say  that  a
             family of one can live in a one bedroom flat.


         (4)      As a British citizen I have a right to live where  I  want
             to, to raise my family."

4.    Mr Musonza appeared today as he did before  Judge  Thorne  and  it  is
    clear to me that in his concession during his submissions that  he  did
    not submit the required documents to the Entry  Clearance  Officer  nor
    did the Appellant and although it is right to say  he  presented  those
    documents to the judge. As I explained to him, that was well after  the
    application was made.

5.    Mr Nath on behalf  of  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  quite  properly
    reminds me that "the Rules are the Rules" and it was essential for  the
    Appellant  to  have  provided  the  required  documentation  with   the
    application for entry clearance.  Mr Nath  says  that  the  appropriate
    thing for the Appellant and Sponsor to do would be for them to  make  a
    new application for entry clearance.

6.    Mr Musonza was somewhat aggrieved by the hearing before Judge  Thorne.
     He said he thought the  judge  felt  agitated.   Mr  Musonza  said  he
    apologised for that and he was acting as a litigant in person but  that
    he produced various documents and bank  statements.   Mr  Musonza  says
    that insofar as making a further application is concerned that that  is
    a money-making scheme of the Home Office and that it  might  cost  some
    �2,000 for him to make a new application for  his  wife  to  enter  the
    United Kingdom.  He also refers to his first child having been born  (I
    think in October 2017) and that he wishes for the family to  be  united
    here.  He says that he has not gone down the route of trying to get his
    wife to come to Europe via Spain, he is patriotic, and he wants  to  do
    the right thing because he is British.

7.    Now as I explained to Mr Musonza, it is  I  am  afraid  as  simple  as
    this: He failed to produce the documents and so did the Appellant  when
    the application for entry  clearance  was  made.   When  permission  to
    appeal was granted the judge did say that the grounds  needed  refining
    and clarifying but that there may be a point in respect of the  English
    language test.  In my judgment this case really had nothing to do  with
    the English language test because the judge did not  find  against  the
    Appellant on that.  The judge made it very clear in that paragraph that
    I have read  out  that  the  essential  specified  documents  were  not
    provided with the application.  It means, in my  judgment  that  it  is
    abundantly clear that the FTT judge had to dismiss the appeal.

8.    The judge however went on to deal at length with  Article  8  and  set
    out all of the appropriate decisions such as Huang, Razgar  and  indeed
    other authorities thereafter.   In  my  judgment  there  is  simply  no
    identifiable material error of law.  In the  circumstances  I  conclude
    that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge shall stand.

9.    Now as I explained to the Sponsor  it  is  a  matter  for  him  as  to
    whether he decides to see lawyers or  not  but  application  for  entry
    clearance may not necessarily be as straightforward and as simple as he
    thinks he and the Appellant may wish to consider taking legal advice if
    they are to make a new application for entry clearance.


Notice of Decision

There is no error of law in the Judge's decision. It  shall  stand  and  the
Appellant's appeal remains dismissed.
