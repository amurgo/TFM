                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction and Background

 1. The Entry Clearance Officer (ECO) appeals against the decision of Judge
    Heatherington of the First-tier Tribunal (the FtT) promulgated  on  1st
    June 2015.

 2. The Respondent before the Upper Tribunal was the Appellant  before  the
    FtT and I will refer to him as the claimant.

 3. The claimant is a male citizen of Pakistan born 10th November 1986  who
    applied for entry clearance to the United Kingdom as the  spouse  of  a
    British citizen, Zalekha Amina Taras (the Sponsor).

 4. The application was refused on 28th July  2014  on  financial  grounds.
    The ECO did not accept that the requirements of E-ECP.3.1  of  Appendix
    FM were satisfied in that it was not accepted that the  Sponsor  had  a
    specified gross annual income of at least �18,600.

 5. It was noted that the Sponsor had two employments,  but  the  specified
    documentation had not been submitted to demonstrate that the  Sponsor's
    income was as claimed.  The bank statements submitted did not show  the
    Sponsor's income from her employment  with  Hounsfield  Printing  being
    paid into her bank account as required.

 6. The Appellant appealed, his representatives contending that documentary
    evidence had been submitted to prove  the  Sponsor's  income,  and  the
    Sponsor had explained why she did not deposit all of  her  income  from
    her employment with Hounsfield Printing into  her  account.   This  was
    because she was paid cash, and she used some of this cash  to  pay  her
    expenses.

 7. The decision was then reviewed by an Entry Clearance Manager, who found
    that specified evidence in relation to the  Sponsor's  income  had  not
    been submitted, and maintained the decision to refuse  entry  clearance
    on that basis.

 8. The Entry Clearance Manager considered Article 8 of the  1950  European
    Convention on Human Rights (the 1950 Convention) and was satisfied that
    refusal of entry clearance  was  justified  by  the  need  to  maintain
    effective immigration control, and did not  accept  that  the  decision
    breached Article 8.

 9. The appeal was heard by the FtT on 15th May 2015.  It was  conceded  on
    behalf of the claimant that the appeal  could  not  succeed  under  the
    Immigration Rules as specified evidence had not been submitted with the
    application to prove the Sponsor had  an  annual  income  of  at  least
    �18,600.

10. Reliance was placed upon Article 8, and  the  FtT  allowed  the  appeal
    under Article 8, outside the Immigration Rules.

11. The ECO applied for permission to appeal.  In summary it was  contended
    that the FtT had made a material misdirection of law  in  allowing  the
    appeal under Article 8.  Reliance was placed upon paragraph  38  of  SS
    (Congo) [2015] EWCA Civ 387 which states  that  requirements  upon  the
    state in regard to Article 8 are less stringent in  a  leave  to  enter
    (LTE) application.

12. It was contended that the FtT had failed to make a finding  as  to  why
    the claimant and Sponsor could not enjoy their family life outside  the
    United Kingdom, and although the FtT had referred to SS (Congo) it  was
    submitted that the FtT  had  erred  by  relying  on  this  decision  to
    establish that refusal of the application for entry clearance would  be
    unduly harsh.  There was no finding that it would be unduly  harsh  for
    the Appellant and Sponsor to  relocate  to  Pakistan  to  pursue  their
    family life.

13. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge P J G White of the FtT in the
    following terms;

         "(a) It was accepted on behalf of the Appellant that he  could  not
             meet the financial requirements of Appendix FM  (paras  3-10).
             The judge however allowed the  appeal  under  Article  8  ECHR
             (para 25).

         (b)  I am satisfied that in  regard  to  'compelling  circumstances
             outside the Rules' the judge arguably made an error of law  by
             failing to take into account and/or failing to  make  adequate
             findings in regard to

             (i)  the ability of the parties to live together  in  Pakistan
                  (see for example the discussion of  the  interrelationship
                  between  EX1  (insurmountable  obstacles)  and  Article  8
                  (exceptional circumstances) in Agyarko and  Others  [2015]
                  EWCA Civ 440 and

             (ii) the ability of the Appellant to make a fresh  application
                  for entry clearance (see for  example  the  discussion  in
                  Sabir (Appendix FM - EX.1 not  freestanding)  [2014]  UKUT
                  00063 (IAC)".

14. Following the grant of  permission  there  was  no  response  from  the
    claimant pursuant to rule 24 of The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal)
    Rules 2008.  The Tribunal issued directions  that  there  should  be  a
    hearing before the Upper Tribunal to decide whether  the  FtT  decision
    contained an error of law such that it should be set aside.

The Upper Tribunal Hearing

The ECO's Submissions

15. Mr Richards relied upon the grounds contained  within  the  application
    for permission to appeal.  He submitted that the FtT had not identified
    what compelling circumstances existed to make it appropriate  to  allow
    the appeal under Article 8 outside the Immigration Rules.  Mr  Richards
    submitted that inadequate reasons  had  been  given  for  finding  that
    compelling circumstances existed.

16. I asked Mr Richards if he could explain the reference in  paragraph  25
    of  the  FtT  decision,  to  the  Presenting  Officer  before  the  FtT
    indicating  "that   the   decision   under   appeal   was   no   longer
    proportionate".  Mr Richards stated that he could not explain this, and
    there was no reference to this in the Presenting Officer's  minutes  of
    the hearing.

The Claimant's Submissions

17. Mr Lane relied upon his skeleton  argument  dated  17th  February  2016
    which I will not set out in full, but will briefly summarise Mr  Lane's
    submissions below.

18. Mr Lane noted that the FtT found that the Sponsor's income from her two
    jobs exceeded the threshold of �18,600, but had not been  evidenced  in
    accordance with the rules.

19.  The  FtT  correctly  considered  section  117B  of  the   Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act  2002  (the  2002  Act)  noting  an  English
    language  ability,  and   financial   independence.    In   considering
    proportionality the FtT found that the Sponsor had genuine  employment,
    and had paid tax, and that there was reference at the  FtT  hearing  to
    the Presenting Officer indicating that the decision under appeal was no
    longer proportionate.

20. Mr Lane submitted that the inability to satisfy the  Immigration  Rules
    was a technicality, and was the nearest of  misses,  and  the  FtT  was
    entitled to take this into account when assessing proportionality.

21. Mr Lane submitted that Judge White  when  granting  permission  was  in
    error in referring to Agyarko, which  involved  the  principles  to  be
    considered in leave to remain cases rather than leave to enter, and had
    granted permission on an issue that had not been  raised  by  the  ECO,
    that being the possibility of the claimant making a  fresh  application
    for entry clearance.  In any event it was submitted that this would not
    be appropriate given the amount of  time  that  had  passed  since  the
    application was made, and the unchallenged findings of fact made by the
    FtT.

22. Mr Lane's primary submission was that the FtT had not materially  erred
    in law, but in the alternative, if it  was  found  that  there  was  an
    error, the decision could be re-made by the Upper Tribunal based on the
    unchallenged findings of fact summarised at paragraph 4 of the skeleton
    argument.

23. Mr Richards had no response to make, and did not disagree  that  if  an
    error was found, the decision could be re-made by  the  Upper  Tribunal
    without a further hearing.

24. I reserved my decision.

My Conclusions and Reasons

25. I am satisfied that Judge White did not err in granting permission, and
    that he was entitled to grant permission to appeal on the circumstances
    set out in his decision.  In my view the challenge to the FtT  decision
    was that compelling circumstances had not been identified and  adequate
    reasons for those findings had not been given.

26. In my view the FtT did materially err  in  allowing  the  appeal  under
    Article 8 outside the Immigration Rules, for the following reasons.

27. The FtT did not apply in full the principles set out in SS (Congo)  and
    I set out below paragraph 37 of that decision;

         "On the other hand, if someone from the United  Kingdom  marries  a
         foreign national or establishes a family life with them at a  stage
         when they are contemplating trying to live together in  the  United
         Kingdom, or when they know that their partner does not have a right
         to come there (an extreme example of this would be the case of a so-
         called mail order bride), the relationship will  have  been  formed
         under conditions  of  known  precariousness  which  will  make  the
         analogy with Strasbourg case law reviewed in Nagre a close one (see
         also Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali v United  Kingdom  (1985)  7
         EHRR 471 at [68]).  In that sort of case, it will be appropriate to
         apply  a  similar  test  of  exceptional  circumstances  before   a
         violation of Article 8 will be found to  arise  in  relation  to  a
         refusal to grant LTE outside the Rules".

28. It is also relevant to consider paragraph 40 which I set out  below  in
    part;

         "However, it remains possible to imagine cases where the individual
         interests at stake are of a particularly pressing nature so that  a
         good claim for LTE can be established outside the  Rules.   In  our
         view, the appropriate general formulation for this category is that
         such cases will arise where an applicant  for  LTE  can  show  that
         compelling  circumstances  exist  (which   are   not   sufficiently
         recognised under the new  Rules)  to  require  the  grant  of  such
         leave".

29. The FtT considered proportionality at paragraph 25, and concluded  that
    there are exceptional circumstances that would arise  if  the  claimant
    was not granted leave to enter,  and  the  FtT  found  that  compelling
    circumstances existed for granting leave to the claimant to  enter  the
    United Kingdom.  The error of the FtT is not to adequately explain what
    in this case amounts to compelling and exceptional circumstances.   The
    FtT notes that the Sponsor is a British citizen and has  employment  in
    the United Kingdom, and  notes  that  when  the  Sponsor  and  claimant
    married, they knew the claimant had no right  to  come  to  the  United
    Kingdom.  In my view, those findings do not amount  to  exceptional  or
    compelling circumstances.  The FtT also records that the  claimant  can
    speak English and there  would  be  financial  independence.   The  FtT
    appears not to have considered the principles in AM Malawi [2015]  UKUT
    0260 (IAC) and I set out below the second paragraph in the head note;

         "(2)     An Appellant can obtain no positive right to  a  grant  of
             leave to remain from either  s117B(2)  or  (3),  whatever  the
             degree of his fluency in  English,  or  the  strength  of  his
             financial resources".

30. I appreciate that in this case the application is for  leave  to  enter
    rather than leave to remain, but the principle set  out  above  is  the
    same.

31. The FtT does not consider the possibility of the Sponsor relocating  to
    Pakistan, and this is an error, neither does the FtT consider  why  the
    claimant could not make a further application for entry clearance,  and
    again in my view this is an error of law.

32. Therefore the decision of the FtT cannot stand because of the  material
    error of law, and is set aside.

33. Both representatives invited me to re-make the decision, if a  material
    error of law was found and the decision of the FtT was set aside, and I
    find that it is appropriate to do so.

34. It has been rightly  conceded  that  the  claimant  cannot  succeed  by
    reliance upon the Immigration Rules as the financial  requirements  are
    not satisfied.  I therefore consider Article 8 outside the  Immigration
    Rules and I set out below Article 8 of the 1950 Convention;

          1) Everyone has the right to respect for his private  and  family
             life, his home and his correspondence.

          2) There shall be no interference by a public authority with  the
             exercise of this right except such as is  in  accordance  with
             the law and is  necessary  in  a  democratic  society  in  the
             interests of national security, public safety or the  economic
             well-being of the country, for the prevention of  disorder  or
             crime, for the protection of health  or  morals,  or  for  the
             protection of the rights and freedoms of others.

35. The claimant must establish that he has established a family or private
    life that engages Article 8, and the ECO must then establish  that  the
    decision is in accordance with  the  law,  necessary  for  one  of  the
    reasons set out in Article 8(2), and proportionate.

36. In considering Article 8  I  have  followed  the  five  stage  approach
    advocated in Razgar [2004] UKHL 27.  The decision in Beoku-Betts [2008]
    UKHL 39, means that I must consider the family and private life of  the
    Sponsor as well as the claimant.

37. I am satisfied that the Sponsor and claimant have established a  family
    life.  I accept that they have a genuine relationship,  and  that  they
    married on 6th April 2012.  I find that refusal of entry  clearance  is
    an interference with their family  life,  which  they  wish  to  pursue
    together in the United Kingdom.

38. However I find that the proposed interference is in accordance with the
    law insofar as it is accepted that  the  claimant  cannot  satisfy  the
    Immigration Rules in order to be granted entry clearance to the  United
    Kingdom.

39. I then have to consider whether the interference is necessary  for  one
    of  the  reasons  set  out  in  Article  8(2),  and   whether   it   is
    proportionate.  When considering proportionality I  take  into  account
    the considerations set out in section 117B of the 2002 Act.

40. The unchallenged findings of the FtT are that the claimant and  Sponsor
    are married and have a genuine relationship.  Both are  able  to  speak
    English.  The Sponsor has employment and is  distressed  at  separation
    from the claimant.

41. Mention has  been  made  of  the  Presenting  Officer  before  the  FtT
    commenting that the decision under appeal was no longer  proportionate.
    I cannot ascertain any relevant reference to  this  in  the  Record  of
    Proceedings, and this observation by the FtT seems unexplained.  In any
    event, the decision on proportionality is one for the Tribunal, and the
    Record of Proceedings does not indicate  that  the  Presenting  Officer
    before the FtT conceded that the appeal  should  be  allowed.   On  the
    contrary, the Record  of  Proceedings  indicates  that  the  Presenting
    Officer relied upon the ECO decision to refuse  entry  clearance  dated
    28th July 2014.

42. The Court of Appeal gave further guidance in relation to an application
    for leave to enter on the basis of family life with a person already in
    the United Kingdom at paragraph 39 of SS (Congo).  In brief  summary  a
    person outside the United Kingdom may have a good claim under Article 8
    to be allowed to enter to join family members already here, but Article
    8 does not confer an automatic right of entry, and imposes  no  general
    obligation on the state to facilitate the  choice  made  by  a  married
    couple to reside in it.  The state is entitled to control  immigration.
    There are a range of factors to be taken into account, and in paragraph
    40 it is stated that the state has a wider margin  of  appreciation  in
    determining the conditions to be satisfied before  leave  to  enter  is
    granted, by  contrast  with  the  position  in  relation  to  decisions
    regarding leave to remain for persons with a non-precarious family life
    already established in the United Kingdom.

43. I have taken into account Mr Lane's  submission  as  to  the  technical
    nature of the failure to meet the Immigration Rules and the  near  miss
    aspect of this case.  I think it appropriate to set  out  the  guidance
    from SS (Congo) in  relation  to  Appendix  FM-SE  which  contains  the
    evidential requirements;

         51.  In our judgment, the approach to Article 8 in the light of the
             Rules in Appendix FM-SE should be the same as  in  respect  of
             the substantive LTE and LTR Rules in Appendix  FM.   In  other
             words, the same  general  position  applies,  that  compelling
             circumstances will have to apply to justify a grant of LTE  or
             LTR where the evidence Rules are not complied with.

         52.  This is for two principal reasons.  First, the evidence  rules
             have the same general  objective  as  the  substantive  rules,
             namely to limit the risk that someone  is  admitted  into  the
             United Kingdom and then becomes a burden on public  resources,
             and the Secretary of State has the same  primary  function  in
             relation to them, to assess the risk and put in place measures
             which are judged suitable  to  contain  it  within  acceptable
             bounds.  Similar weight should be given to her  assessment  of
             what the public interest requires in both contexts.

         53.  Secondly, enforcement  of  the  evidence  rules  ensures  that
             everyone applying for LTE or LTR is treated equally and fairly
             in relation to the evidential requirements they must satisfy.

44. I remind myself of the comment made by the Supreme Court in  Patel  and
    Others [2013] UKSC 72 at paragraph 57;

         57.  It is important to remember that Article 8 is  not  a  general
             dispensing power.

45. In this appeal, I do not find that there are compelling or  exceptional
    circumstances.  The claimant and Sponsor married in the knowledge  that
    the claimant did not have the right to enter the United Kingdom.   This
    is not a case where there are any medical issues or children.

46. The couple wish to live in the United Kingdom, but  it  is  clear  that
    Article 8 does not bestow upon an  individual  an  automatic  right  to
    choose in which country he or she wishes to live.

47. I am being asked to allow this appeal under Article  8,  on  the  basis
    that the decision of the ECO is  disproportionate.   I  am,  therefore,
    being asked to disregard the fact that the  financial  requirements  of
    the Immigration Rules cannot be met.  The Court of Appeal have made  it
    clear in SS  (Congo)  that  in  relation  to  a  failure  to  meet  the
    evidential requirements, compelling  circumstances  need  to  exist  to
    justify a grant of leave to enter.

48. It is open to the claimant  to  make  a  fresh  application  for  entry
    clearance.  I reject the submission that this would not be  appropriate
    because of the length of time that has elapsed.  In my view, the weight
    to be attached to maintaining effective immigration  control  outweighs
    the weight to be attached to the wishes of the Sponsor and claimant  to
    live  together  in  the  United  Kingdom,  notwithstanding   that   the
    Immigration Rules cannot be satisfied.

49. The decision of the ECO is proportionate, and does not breach Article 8
    of the 1950 Convention.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the FtT involved the making of an error of law and  was  set
