                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background

1.    The Appellant is a  national  of  Pakistan  who  appeals  against  the
    Respondent's decision dated 6 May 2015 refusing him  further  leave  to
    remain under Article 8 ECHR on the basis of his medical  condition  and
    the private life he has formed since arriving in the UK last  in  2004.
    The refusal of leave to remain  followed  the  grant  of  a  period  of
    discretionary leave in  2012.   His  appeal  against  the  Respondent's
    decision was dismissed by First-tier Tribunal Judge  G  D  Tobin  in  a
    decision promulgated on 9 May 2016 on the basis  that  there  were  "no
    insurmountable obstacles" to the Appellant  returning  to  Pakistan  to
    continue his medical treatment and there was no  reason  to  allow  the
    appeal outside the Rules.

2.    This appeal came before me first on 17 January 2017 when  I  found  an
    error of law in  Judge  Tobin's  decision,  set  that  aside  and  gave
    directions for a further hearing to include  consideration  of  updated
    medical evidence and legal submissions relating, in particular, to  the
    import and application of the European Court's decision in Paposhvili v
    Belgium (Application No 41738/10).  My earlier decision is appended  to
    this decision for ease of reference.

3.    The main focus of the appeal  is  the  Appellant's  medical  condition
    (although I have also received evidence as to his private  life  formed
    in the UK).  The Appellant has undergone a kidney transplant in the UK.
    He continues to  receive  treatment  and  medication  to  maintain  his
    health.  I set out below the most recent evidence as to  his  condition
    and the evidence received on both  sides  as  to  the  availability  of
    treatment in Pakistan.

4.    The resumed hearing took place on 5 June 2017.  The Respondent  failed
    to meet the deadline for her skeleton argument  and  further  evidence.
    On that basis, Counsel for the Appellant objected to the  admission  of
    the further evidence.  I declined  to  shut  out  that  evidence  as  I
    considered that I would be assisted by as much evidence as possible  as
    to  the  treatment  available  in  Pakistan  (particularly   when   the
    Appellant's position is that the availability of treatment in his  home
    country is of greater relevance following the judgment in  Paposhvili).
    I therefore indicated that I would receive  submissions  on  the  legal
    position and such evidence as existed at the date of  the  hearing  but
    would permit  the  Appellant  to  adduce  further  evidence  about  the
    treatment available in Pakistan, following which I  would  re-make  the
    decision on the papers, taking into account any additional evidence and
    the evidence and submissions considered at the hearing on 5 June 2017.

5.     I  received  further  evidence  in  writing  from   the   Appellant's
    solicitors under cover of a letter dated 3 July 2017.  I refer to  that
    so far as relevant below.

Relevant Case Law

6.    Although the  Appellant's  application  refused  by  the  Respondent's
    decision under appeal was  initially  based  on  Article  8  ECHR,  the
    Appellant now relies also on Article 3 ECHR.  He contends  that,  as  a
    consequence  of  his  medical  condition  and  the  lack  of  treatment
    available to him in Pakistan, return will lead to him suffering to  the
    extent that his condition will involve inhuman and degrading treatment.
     He relies in particular on Paposhvili in support of a submission  that
    the level of suffering required to breach Article  3  ECHR  is  lowered
    from the cases which have in the past succeeded (see in particular  D v
    United Kingdom [1997] ECHR 30240/96 and the distinguishing of that case
    in N v United Kingdom [2008] EHRR 39).

7.    Paposhvili v Belgium (Application 41738/10) - Grand Chamber  Judgment:
    13 December 2016
    This case concerned the removal from Belgium to  Georgia  of  a  person
    suffering from leukaemia, tuberculosis and hepatitis C.  The  appellant
    had  also  suffered  a  stroke  and  had  his  fingers  amputated.  His
    conditions had been stabilised by treatment in Belgium by the  time  of
    the removal decision but it is right to note as did the  Grand  Chamber
    at [195] that without the treatment which the appellant  was  receiving
    in Belgium, his life expectancy was less than six months.  It  is  also
    worthy of note that the treatment which the appellant was receiving  in
    Belgium for his leukaemia in particular was the  only  hope  which  the
    appellant had of a cure.

8.    The European Court of  Human  Rights  held  at  first  instance  that,
    following the case law in D v UK  and  N  v  UK,  the  case  should  be
    dismissed.  The Grand Chamber overturned that decision.   Although  the
    Grand Chamber cited the previous case law and did not disapprove it, it
    went on to depart from those cases.  The reasoning for its decision  is
    to be found in the following paragraphs (cited so far as relevant):-
            "[181]     The Court concludes from this recapitulation  of  the
           case-law that the application of Article  3  of  the  Convention
           only in cases where the person  facing  expulsion  is  close  to
           death, which has been its practice since the judgment in N v the
           United Kingdom, has deprived aliens who are seriously  ill,  but
           whose condition  is  less  critical,  of  the  benefit  of  that
           provision.  As a corollary to this, the case-law subsequent to N
           v the United Kingdom has not  provided  more  detailed  guidance
           regarding the "very exceptional cases" referred to in  N  v  the
           United Kingdom, other than the case  contemplated  in  D  v  the
           United Kingdom.
            [182]      In the light of the foregoing, and  reiterating  that
           it is essential that the Convention is interpreted  and  applied
           in a manner which renders its rights practical and effective and
           not theoretical and illusory... the Court is of  the  view  that
           the approach adopted hitherto should be clarified.
            [183]      The Court considers that the "other very  exceptional
           cases" within the meaning of the judgment  in  N  v  the  United
           Kingdom .. which may raise an issue under Article  3  should  be
           understood to refer to situations involving  the  removal  of  a
           seriously ill person in  which  substantial  grounds  have  been
           shown for believing that he or she,  although  not  at  imminent
           risk of dying, would face a real risk, on account of the absence
           of appropriate treatment in the receiving country or the lack of
           access to such treatment, of being exposed to a  serious,  rapid
           and irreversible decline in his or her state of health resulting
           in intense suffering or  to  a  significant  reduction  in  life
           expectancy.   The  Court  points  out  that   these   situations
           correspond to a high threshold for the application of Article  3
           of the Convention in cases  concerning  the  removal  of  aliens
           suffering from serious illness.
            [184]      ...the primary responsibility  for  implementing  and
           enforcing the guaranteed rights and  freedoms  is  laid  on  the
           national authorities, who  are  thus  required  to  examine  the
           applicants' fears and to assess the  risk  they  would  face  if
           removed to the receiving country, from the standpoint of Article
           3....
           [185]...in cases of this kind, the authorities' obligation under
           Article 3 to protect the integrity of the persons  concerned  is
           fulfilled primarily through appropriate procedures allowing such
           examination to be carried out...
            [186]      In the context of these procedures,  it  is  for  the
           applicants to adduce  evidence  capable  of  demonstrating  that
           there are substantial grounds for believing that, if the measure
           complained of were to be implemented, they would be exposed to a
           real risk of being subjected to treatment  contrary  to  Article
           3...a  certain  degree  of  speculation  is  inherent   in   the
           preventive purpose of Article 3 and that it is not a  matter  of
           requiring the persons concerned to provide clear proof of  their
           claim that they would be exposed to proscribed treatment....
            [187]      Where  such  evidence  is  adduced,  it  is  for  the
           authorities of the  returning  State,  in  the  context  of  the
           domestic procedures, to dispel any doubts raised  by  it...  The
           risk alleged must be subjected to close scrutiny...in the course
           of which the authorities in the returning  State  must  consider
           the foreseeable  consequences  of  removal  for  the  individual
           concerned in the receiving State, in the light  of  the  general
           situation    there     and     the     individual's     personal
           circumstances...The assessment of  the  risk  ...must  therefore
           take into consideration general sources such as reports  of  the
           World  Health  Organisation  or  of  reputable  non-governmental
           organisations and the medical certificates concerning the person
           in question.
           [188]...what is in issue here is the negative obligation not  to
           expose persons to a risk of ill-treatment proscribed by  Article
           3.  It  follows  that  the  impact  of  removal  on  the  person
           concerned must be assessed by comparing  his  or  her  state  of
           health prior to removal and how it would evolve  after  transfer
           to the receiving State.
            [189]      ....the  authorities  in  the  returning  State  must
           verify on  a  case-by-case  basis  whether  the  care  generally
           available in the receiving State is sufficient  and  appropriate
           in practice for the treatment of the applicant's illness  so  as
           to prevent him or her being exposed  to  treatment  contrary  to
           Article 3...The benchmark is not the level of care  existing  in
           the returning State;  it  is  not  a  question  of  ascertaining
           whether the care in the receiving State would be  equivalent  or
           inferior to that provided  by  the  health-care  system  in  the
           returning State.  Nor is it possible to derive from Article 3  a
           right to receive specific treatment in the receiving State which
           is not available to the rest of the population.
            [190]      The authorities must  also  consider  the  extent  to
           which the individual in question will actually  have  access  to
           this care and these facilities  in  the  receiving  State.   The
           Court  ...has  previously  questioned   the   accessibility   of
           care...and  referred  to  the  need  to  consider  the  cost  of
           medication and treatment, the existence of a social  and  family
           network, and the distance to  be  travelled  in  order  to  have
           access to the required care...
            [191]       Where,  after  the  relevant  information  has  been
           examined, serious doubts persist regarding the impact of removal
           on the persons concerned - on account of the  general  situation
           in the receiving country and/or their individual situation - the
           returning State must obtain individual and sufficient assurances
           from the receiving State, as a precondition  for  removal,  that
           appropriate treatment will be available and  accessible  to  the
           persons concerned so that they  do  not  find  themselves  in  a
           situation contrary to Article 3..."

8.    The main distinctions to be drawn based on  this  reasoning  are  two-
    fold.  First, the Grand Chamber recognises that its  decision  marks  a
    departure from what were previously considered to be exceptional  cases
    (sometimes referred to  as  "deathbed"  cases)  on  the  basis  of  the
    extremely high threshold for medical impact which was  required  to  be
    shown.  Second, assessment of  whether  a  "real  risk"  of  Article  3
    treatment will involve consideration of evidence as to availability  of
    treatment to  reduce  the  risk  below  that  threshold  which  imports
    considerations not merely whether treatment is offered in  the  country
    of return but whether such treatment is affordable and likely therefore
    to be able to be accessed by a claimant.   It  is  for  a  claimant  to
    provide evidence but in  some  cases,  it  may  be  necessary  for  the
    returning State to investigate for itself what treatment  is  available
    and accessible and in some cases, it may be necessary for the returning
    State to seek assurances from the destination State.

9.    The Appellant accepts however that the bench-mark  for  what  care  is
    "sufficient and appropriate" is not that which exists in the  returning
    State and that  the  test  does  not  involve  drawing  comparisons  to
    disparities between the level of treatment in that State and  the  home
    country.  The real question (as identified at [192] of  Paposhvili)  is
    whether removal will expose an applicant to a "real risk" of Article  3
    ill-treatment.  The threshold for a real risk under  Article  3  is  of
    course a high one.

10.   The Respondent relies on domestic case-law, in particular  GS  (India)
    v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2015] EWCA Civ  40  which
    is of particular application in this case  as  it  dealt  with  medical
    issues involving kidney failure.  She draws my attention in  particular
    to the following passage:-
            "[66]      These citations demonstrate that in the view  of  the
           House of Lords the D exception is confined  to  deathbed  cases.
           Miss  Lieven  submitted  that  the  focus  of  their  Lordships'
           reasoning (at least that of Lord Nicholls) was upon  those  with
           AIDS, a condition much more often suffered than  ESKD;  so  that
           the strictures in N should not be taken to apply to  the  latter
           class of case.  But  that  would  be  merely  adventitious,  and
           therefore unprincipled; and I can find nothing to support it  in
           their Lordships' speeches.
            [67] The result is all of a piece with the  repeated  statements
           in the Strasbourg  court  that  '[a]liens  who  are  subject  to
           expulsion cannot in principle claim any entitlement to remain in
           the territory of a Contracting State in  order  to  continue  to
           benefit from medical, social or other forms  of  assistance  and
           services provided by the expelling State' (N v UK paragraph  42;
           cf paragraph 44, and paragraph 54 in D v UK)"

11.   In any event, the  Respondent  submits  that,  on  the  evidence,  the
    Appellant's case does not reach the threshold envisaged in  Paposhvili.
    The Respondent relies also on  the  passage  at  [183]  set  out  above
    although obviously  to  opposite  effect.   She  points  out  that  the
    threshold is one which is still to be considered to be a very high one.
     She points out that, in that case, the applicant's life expectancy was
    low (and in fact the applicant passed away during  the  course  of  the
    litigation).  As such, she says that this would fall within  the  class
    of an "exceptional case" in any event.  She also points  out  that  the
    Belgian authorities in that case, had made no attempt to identify  what
    treatment would be available to the applicant on return.  Conversely in
    this case the Respondent has considered the treatment available and  in
    both a previous appeal and  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  in  this
    appeal had produced background  evidence  as  to  the  availability  of
    appropriate medication.  She also points out that the Appellant here is
    effectively seeking to run an argument based on disparity of treatment,
    which argument was expressly disapproved in Paposhvili   (see  citation
    at [189] above).

12.   The Respondent also submits that in light of  binding  domestic  case-
    law, it is not open to me to follow  Paposhvili.   The  Appellant  also
    accepts that Paposhvili involves a departure from, or at the very least
    an extension of, previous jurisprudence of the ECtHR on which  domestic
    case-law relies.  It is accepted therefore that  to  apply  Paposhvili,
    the domestic Courts will need to revisit the domestic case-law.

13.   The Appellant also says that, even if his  case  does  not  reach  the
    threshold for engagement of Article 3 ECHR, he is nonetheless  entitled
    to succeed on the basis that there are very  significant  obstacles  to
    his return (so that paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) is met)  or  that,  coupled
    with the private life which he  has  formed  in  the  UK,  his  medical
    condition is sufficient to entitle him to succeed outside the Rules  on
    the basis that respect  for  his  private  life  outweighs  the  public
    interest (although I did not understand the latter submission to be put
    forward with any great enthusiasm and it does not find mention  in  the
    Appellant's skeleton argument).

14.   I begin by dealing with the issue whether  I  am  able  to  take  into
    account Paposhvili, or whether I am bound to disregard it insofar as it
    is inconsistent with domestic case-law (as the Appellant accepts it  is
    at least to some extent).

15.   Section 2 of the Human Rights Act 1998  requires  domestic  courts  to
    "take into account" decisions of the ECtHR.  Our courts are  not  bound
    to follow them.  As was said  by  Lord  Neuberger  in  Manchester  City
    Council v Pinnock [2011] UKSC 6, however:
           "[48]... Where, however, there is a clear and constant  line  of
           decisions whose effect is not inconsistent with some fundamental
           substantive or procedural aspect of our law, and whose reasoning
           does not appear to overlook or misunderstand  some  argument  or
           point of principle, we consider that it would be wrong for  this
           Court not to follow that line."

16.   The issue which then arises is the extent to which Paposhvili  departs
    from the line of cases dealing with the  engagement  of  Article  3  in
    medical  cases.  At  [79]  of  Paposhvili,  the  Grand  Chamber  itself
    recognises that it has for some time declared as inadmissible a  number
    of applications relying on Article 3 in the medical context in reliance
    on the Grand Chamber's case law established in N.  The Grand Chamber in
    that case had expressly confined Article 3 to "very exceptional cases".
      The Grand Chamber in Paposhvili did however recognise at [181] of its
    judgment that its previous case  law  since  N  had  been  such  as  to
    "deprive[d] aliens who are seriously ill, but whose condition  is  less
    critical, of the benefit of that provision".  On the  other  hand,  the
    passage which I have cited above at [183] of the judgment continues  to
    recognise the very high threshold which  continues  to  apply  and  the
    Respondent points out in her skeleton argument that, on  the  facts  of
    Paposhvili, that could itself have  been  considered  to  be  what  the
    Strasbourg court had previously described as a "very exceptional case".
     To treat it as such  may  not  in  fact  conflict  markedly  with  the
    approach set out by the Court of Appeal in GS.   I  draw  attention  in
    particular to [42] to [45] of the European Court's  judgment  in  N  as
    cited at [49] in that case as follows:
            "[42]      In summary, the Court observes that  since  D  v  the
           United  Kingdom  it  has  consistently  applied  the   following
           principles.  Aliens who  are  subject  to  expulsion  cannot  in
           principle claim any entitlement to remain in the territory of  a
           Contracting State in order to continue to benefit from  medical,
           social or other forms of assistance and services provided by the
           expelling State.  The fact that  the  applicant's  circumstances
           including his life expectancy, would be significantly reduced if
           he were  to  be  removed  from  the  Contracting  State  is  not
           sufficient in itself to give rise to breach of Article  3.   The
           decision to remove an alien who  is  suffering  from  a  serious
           mental or physical illness to a country where the facilities for
           the treatment of that illness are inferior to those available in
           the Contracting State may raise an issue under  Article  3,  but
           only in a very exceptional case, where the humanitarian  grounds
           against the removal are compelling.  In  the  D  case  the  very
           exceptional circumstances were that the applicant was critically
           ill and appeared to be close to death, could not  be  guaranteed
           any nursing or medical care in his country of origin and had  no
           family there willing or able to care for him or provide him with
           even a basic level of food, shelter or social support.
            [43] The Court does not exclude that there  may  be  other  very
           exceptional cases  where  the  humanitarian  considerations  are
           equally  compelling   However,  it  considers  that  it   should
           maintain the high threshold set in D v the  United  Kingdom  and
           applied in its subsequent case-law, which it regards as  correct
           in principle, given that in such cases the alleged  future  harm
           would emanate not from the  intentional  acts  or  omissions  of
           public authorities or  non-State  bodies,  but  instead  from  a
           naturally occurring illness and the lack of sufficient resources
           to deal with it in the receiving country.
            [44] Although many of the rights it contains  have  implications
           of a social or economic nature, the  Convention  is  essentially
           directed at the protection of civil and political rights...While
           it is necessary, given the fundamental importance of  Article  3
           in the Convention system, for the Court to retain  a  degree  of
           flexibility to prevent  expulsion  in  very  exceptional  cases,
           Article 3 does not place an obligation on the Contracting  State
           to alleviate such disparities through the provision of free  and
           unlimited health care to all aliens  without  a  right  to  stay
           within its jurisdiction.  A finding to the contrary would  place
           too great a burden on the Contracting States.
            [45] Finally, the Court  observes  that,  although  the  present
           application, in common with most of those referred to above,  is
           concerned with the expulsion of a  person  with  HIV  and  AIDS-
           related condition, the same principles must apply in relation to
           the  expulsion  of  any  person  afflicted  with  any   serious,
           naturally occurring physical or mental illness which  may  cause
           suffering,  pain  and  reduced  life  expectancy   and   require
           specialised medical  treatment  which  may  not  be  so  readily
           available in the applicant's country of origin or which  may  be
           available only at substantial cost."

17.   Based on that passage, Laws LJ in GS declined to  expand  the  Court's
    reasoning in D for reasons which he explains at [65]  of  the  judgment
    thus (again by reference to a citations from N - this time the House of
    Lord's judgment):-
           "[36] What was it then that made the case exceptional?  It is to
           be found, I think, in the references  to  D's  'present  medical
           condition' (para 50) and to that fact that he was terminally ill
           (paras 51: the advanced  stages  of  a  terminal  and  incurable
           illness'; para  52:  'a  terminally  ill  man';  para  53:  'the
           critical stage now reached in the  applicant's  fatal  illness';
           Judge Pettiti: 'the final stages of an incurable illness').   It
           was the fact that he was  already  terminally  ill  while  still
           present in the territory of the expelling state  that  made  his
           case exceptional."
      He then refers to what is said by Lady Hale in N at [69] as:
           "In my view, therefore, the test,  in  this  sort  of  case,  is
           whether the applicant's illness  has  reached  such  a  critical
           stage (ie he is dying) that it would  be  inhuman  treatment  to
           deprive him of the care which he is currently receiving and send
           him home to an early death unless there is care available  there
           to enable him to meet that fate with dignity (per Lady Hale)"
    On the basis of what is said in N,  Laws  LJ  concludes  at  [66]  that
    "these citations demonstrate that in the view of the House of Lords the
    D exception is confined to deathbed cases".

18.   On the  one  hand,  therefore,  Paposhvili  is  simply  expanding  the
    categories of what constitute a "very exceptional" case.   It  is  not,
    for example, as the Respondent points out, departing from the principle
    that the test is not about disparity of treatment between returning and
    receiving State.  It might in that light be seen only as  a  reflection
    of further circumstances which are capable of showing a "real risk"  of
    ill treatment on return.  On the other, though, there is no doubt  that
    the domestic courts have not understood the  previous  case-law  to  be
    other than that Article 3 in  this  context  is  to  be  very  narrowly
    confined and on the basis of past cases, to  include  only  "death-bed"
    cases.  That though is based squarely on an analysis of the case-law of
    the European Courts.  The domestic courts considered it appropriate  to
    follow that case-law.  That case-law has now  moved  on  by  reason  of
    Paposhvili.  I do not understand what was said by the Supreme Court  in
    Pinnock to preclude me from taking into account the  expansion  of  the
    potential categories of  medical  cases  which  might  prevent  removal
    simply because the Supreme Court has previously decided cases based  on
    what the Grand Chamber has said in previous  judgments  and  where  the
    higher courts have  not  yet  had  the  opportunity  to  consider  this
    expansion.  That is, for reasons I  give  below,  the  main  impact  of
    Paposhvili on the instant case.

19.   In case I am wrong about that, though,  I  have,  when  assessing  the
    Article 3 claim considered  it  both  on  the  basis  of  the  previous
    domestic authorities and based on what is said in Paposhvili.

The Evidence

Medical Evidence

20.   The Appellant had a diagnosis of  IGA  Nephropathy  resulting  in  end
    stage renal failure.  He received dialysis treatment from 2009 to 2013.
     On 28 April 2013, he received a kidney transplant.  According  to  the
    consultants treating him at  Manchester  Royal  Infirmary,  the  kidney
    worked  well  and  the  Appellant  was  left  with  "excellent   kidney
    function".   According  to  a  letter  from   Dr   Morton,   Consultant
    Nephrologist, dated 16 February 2017, a transplanted  kidney  would  be
    expected to last for ten years or so before it started  to  deteriorate
    or fail.

21.   Unfortunately, it appears from Dr Morton's letter (which is  the  most
    recent medical evidence), the  Appellant  has  developed  a  number  of
    complications since the transplant.  He had a  biopsy  in  August  2016
    which suggested a recurrence of his IGA  problem  in  the  transplanted
    kidney.  Dr Morton states that there is "little in the way of effective
    therapies"   for   the   problem   other   than   to   continue    with
    immunosuppression.     The    Appellant    takes    Prograf    as    an
    immunosuppressant.  Dr Morton does suggest that steroid  therapy  might
    be beneficial but that has not been offered to the Appellant as he also
    has diabetes.  Instead, Dr  Morton  has  prescribed  a  blood  pressure
    tablet, Lisinopril, which he suggests may protect the kidney  function.
    The Appellant has also developed a virus.  Dr Morton points  out  that,
    ordinarily,   treatment   for   the   virus   would   be   to    reduce
    immunosuppression but that is "not ideal" because  of  the  Appellant's
    recurrent IGA.

22.   Dr Morton summarises the future treatment required as follows:-
           "Mr Hussain does require regular and specialist attention to his
           kidney transplant and it is anticipated that certainly  for  the
           next year or two he will continue to  need  regular  specialised
           assessments and balancing of immunosuppression against  risk  of
           further deterioration or increase  in  the  BK  virus  infection
           versus protection against the IGA recurrence."
    Dr Morton notes however that  the  Appellant  "otherwise  is  generally
    reasonably well and mobile independently  with  no  significant  cardio
    vascular concerns.


23.   The latter comment sits slightly uncomfortably  with  the  Appellant's
    assertions in his statement that he  is  unable  to  work  much  as  he
    becomes tired.   I  note  also  that  those  assertions  appear  to  be
    undermined by other of the Appellant's evidence from friends to whom he
    provides music lessons, it appears on a frequent and regular basis  and
    who also attest to the Appellant giving regular singing performances.

24.   Dr Morton lists in his letter  the  medications  which  the  Appellant
    currently receives.   It  appears  from  what  he  says  in  the  final
    paragraph that the most important of  those  is  the  immunosuppression
    drug Prograf.  Dr Morton advocates no change  in  the  prescription  of
    that drug.  He says that evidence suggests that  such  a  change  would
    lead to "a deterioration in function with a risk of rejection and graft
    loss which can be life threatening".   Dr Morton also  confirms,  as  I
    indicate above, that the Appellant needs  "continued  surveillance"  in
    relation to his underlying condition  and  virus.   He  concludes  that
    "[f]ailure   for   these   to   be   provided   or   find    transplant
    immunosuppression could result in severe or life threatening damage  to
    the transplant and life."

25.   In terms of evidence of availability of Prograf and  follow  up  care,
    the Appellant relies on a letter from Captain Dr Ijaz Ahmad Kharal  who
    is said to be an Assistant Professor of  Urology  at  the  King  Edward
    Medical  University,  Mayo  Hospital,  Lahore.   Captain   Kharal   has
    apparently been given the Appellant's medical history by Dr Morton.  He
    first says that the need for a specialist organ  care  centre  is  "not
    feasible" in Pakistan.  He then says that Prograf "is not available  in
    Pakistan".  He goes on to say that routine follow  ups  and  medication
    monitoring would cost approximately R30,000 (equivalent to about  �250)
    for medicines and R15,000 (equivalent to about �150).  That appears  to
    be on a  three-monthly  basis.   Captain  Kharal  also  says  that  the
    Appellant would be at risk of getting an infection because of  the  hot
    weather in Pakistan.  That is not confirmed by any of the other medical
    professionals who treat the Appellant.  It is not clear what  level  of
    experience  Captain  Kharal  has  in   dealing   with   patients   with
    transplanted kidneys  nor  what  research  he  has  done  to  form  his
    conclusions about the availability of treatment.

26.   Dr Kharal's assertion that Prograf is not  available  in  Pakistan  is
    also confirmed by a letter also dated in 2017 from Fazal Djn  Pharmacy.
    That says that Prograf is "not  manufacture[d]  in  any  Pharmaceutical
    Company in Pakistan and does not exist in Pakistan in any Medical Store
    or Hospital".

27.   I can give little weight  to  the  evidence  on  which  the  Appellant
    relies as to the availability of treatment in Pakistan  because  it  is
    directly contradicted by evidence produced by the  Respondent  who  has
    contacted an organisation based in Pakistan which exports  and  imports
    pharmaceuticals to that country.  That company, Memon Traders, confirms
    by an e mail dated 31 May 2017 that Prograf is  available  in  Pakistan
    for Kausar Medicos (which I assume to be a  supplier).   Memon  Traders
    say that they are unable to deal in the local market but appear  to  be
    able to do so if the drug is needed for "pernol"  (which  I  assume  to
    mean personal use).  They say the cost for 50  capsules  is  PKR  3500.
    That appears though to be the charge to Kausar Medicos.   That  equates
    to about �25.  That is for a 1mg  capsule  although  the  Appellant  is
    prescribed 2mgs twice daily.  Fifty capsules would therefore last  less
    than one month (even  if  the  cost  put  forward  is  that  which  the
    Appellant could expect to pay). A printout  from  the  Pakistan  Kidney
    Patients Association website (see below) produced by the Respondent and
    dating back to 2009 refers to immunosuppressant  medication  costing  a
    patient about R13000 to 15000 per month.  That evidence  is  of  course
    somewhat dated.

28.   The Respondent has also  produced  some  general  COI  material  about
    availability of kidney treatment and medication.  That dates from  2008
    and 2010 and is not directly on point but does confirm that  drugs  are
    available for blood pressure and diabetes.  The 2008 COI evidence  also
    indicates that essential medicines are in short  supply  in  government
    health facilities and so most people have to obtain their own medicines
    from a pharmacy or a dispensing physician.   The  point  is  made  that
    medical health insurance is not generally available and that access  to
    basic essential treatments is not available or of limited  availability
    to those living below the national poverty line (said  in  2008  to  be
    about 29% of the population).  The COI material does however  refer  to
    the Pakistan Kidney Patients Association which in 2008 had a centre  in
    Rawalpindi and was at that time "providing a number of services to poor
    kidney patients to offset the effects of this expensive  treatment  and
    improve their quality of life:  Free/Subsidized  supply  of  medicines,
    laboratory  services  and   medical   equipment.   Such   as   dialysis
    kits/dialysis solutions, blood enhancing injections etc.  Provision  of
    post transplant immunosuppressive medicines".  The COI also points to a
    number of hospitals throughout Pakistan, public and private, which have
    nephrology departments providing care for those with kidney disease.

29.   The 2010 COI provides information about The Kidney  Centre,  based  in
    Rawalpindi  which  stated  that  it   was   "dedicated   to   providing
    comprehensive preoperative to  patients  with  chronic  renal  disease,
    including end-stage renal disease"  and  that  "the  Kidney  Transplant
    Program   is   one   component   of   the   full-service    Multi-Organ
    Transplantation Program" at that centre.  There is  also  reference  to
    The Noor Foundation UK which is said to have  eighteen  "state  of  the
    art" kidney dialysis centres  across  Pakistan  located  in  government
    hospitals and managed day to day by its NGOs in Pakistan.

30.   The evidence produced by the Respondent was  supplied  very  late  (31
    May 2017) and Mr Schwenk made an application to exclude it.  I declined
    that application,  particularly  in  circumstances  where  one  of  the
    complaints made by the Appellant is that the Respondent has  failed  to
    provide evidence of treatment available in Pakistan.  It would be wrong
    to exclude the  very  evidence  which  the  Appellant  says  should  be
    provided.  I indicated though that, in light of the late  provision  of
    this evidence, I would allow the Appellant time to provide evidence  to
    rebut this.

31.   Under cover of a letter dated 3 July 2017, the Appellant's  solicitors
    provided me with a series of  e  mails  which  they  had  sent  to  the
    organisations  referred  to  in  the  COI  evidence  produced  by   the
    Respondent.  Those were all dated 19 June 2017.  It appears that two of
    the organisations, the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences  and  Naz
    Hospital, Lahore are no longer in operation or at least not under those
    names.  The letter indicates that none of the  organisations  concerned
    had responded within the two weeks between the e mails and the  letter.
    In the submission of the writer of the letter, "the reluctant  attitude
    of the medical institutes in Pakistan has demonstrated high possibility
    of him being unable to have access to the medical care that he requires
    in Pakistan" which would cause "detrimental damage to  the  appellant's
    health and may even result in a life threatening situation for him."

Other Evidence

32.   In  addition  to  the  evidence  surrounding  the  Appellant's  health
    conditions and availability of treatment for those conditions,  I  have
    received statements from the  Appellant  and  a  number  of  supporting
    letters.  As I mention  above,  the  Appellant  speaks  of  his  health
    conditions limiting his ability to work which  is  undermined  to  some
    extent at least by the medical  evidence  and  the  statements  of  his
    friends.  The Appellant also refers to his family in Pakistan.  He  has
    a mother, younger brother and younger sister  there.   His  father  has
    passed away.  His younger brother is responsible for the maintenance of
    his mother and younger sister (who is unmarried).  His younger  brother
    is a salesman and is earning only just enough to maintain the family he
    has there.  The Appellant says that his younger brother would be unable
    to afford to pay for him and in particular his medical condition.  That
    the family live in difficult conditions in Pakistan is  also  confirmed
    by Mr Jafri who writes one of the letters of support.

33.   The letters of support are from the Appellant's  friends  in  the  UK.
    Some  have  been  helping  him  with  accommodation  and  other  living
    expenses.  All speak  of  his  musical  abilities  and  his  continuing
    performances (of Indian classical singing).  Most are  tutored  by  the
    Appellant on a frequent and  regular  basis.   The  Appellant  is  also
    supported by the Shia Islamic Centre and many of  the  writers  of  the
    letters speak of him as a valued member of the Shia Muslim community in
    Manchester as well as elsewhere in the country where he  is  apparently
    also known because of his singing abilities.

Decision and Reasons

Article 3 claim

34.   I indicated at [19] above, that I would consider the Article  3  claim
    both on the basis of existing domestic case-law and then on  the  basis
    that Paposhvili applies.

35.   I can deal  briefly  with  the  Article  3  claim  based  on  existing
    domestic case-law. Based on what is said by Laws LJ  in  GS  (which  is
    clearly the most relevant of the domestic cases) as I have set  out  at
    [16] above, the Appellant's claim cannot  succeed.   Indeed,  the  very
    fact that the Appellant did not pursue a claim based on Article 3 until
    following the Grand Chamber's judgment  in  Paposhvili  recognises  the
    futility of such a claim.

36.   As I indicate at [9] above, the issue for determination following  the
    Grand Chamber's judgment in Paposhvili is whether there is a real  risk
    of treatment contravening Article 3 ECHR  occasioned  by  the  removal.
    This imports a consideration of the medical evidence about  the  effect
    of removal  and  any  changes  or  deficiencies  in  treatment  of  the
    claimant's medical condition which in  turn  imports  consideration  of
    what treatment is available.

37.   In terms of the Appellant's current medical condition, as noted in  Dr
    Morton's letter, that condition is stable and  well-managed  using  the
    drugs which he is currently prescribed as well as regular monitoring of
    his condition.  Dr Morton in the most recent  evidence  says  that  the
    Appellant is generally well and mobile.  I have  already  rejected  the
    Appellant's evidence that his general health is poor to the extent that
    he cannot work because he tires easily based both  on  what  Dr  Morton
    says but also the  picture  painted  by  the  Appellant's  friends  and
    supporters which is that the Appellant maintains an  ability  to  teach
    music and perform.

38.   The evidence which the  Appellant  has  presented  in  support  of  an
    assertion that Prograf is not available in  Pakistan  is  unpersuasive,
    particularly in  light  of  the  individualised  consideration  of  its
    availability in  the  e  mails  from  an  import/export  pharmaceutical
    company in Pakistan produced by the Respondent.  Although  Dr  Kharal's
    medical credentials are clear on the face of his letter,  he  does  not
    set out his experience; nor does he say what investigations he has made
    leading him to the assertion that Prograf is not available.  The letter
    from Fazal Djn Pharmacy is unimpressive.  Not  only  is  the  assertion
    there made undermined by the e mails which the Respondent has  produced
    but the letter itself does not even give the name  of  the  person  who
    provides this information let  alone  any  information  about  how  the
    writer   is   proficient   to   give   this   opinion   or   on    what
    information/research it is based.  I therefore  find  as  a  fact  that
    Prograf is available. The Appellant does not provide any evidence  that
    the other medication which he is taking is not available in Pakistan.

39.   The  second  question  concerns  the  monitoring  of  the  Appellant's
    condition.  Although Dr Kharal  says  that  a  "specialist  organ  care
    center" in Pakistan is "not feasible",  it  is  clear  that  there  are
    facilities offering services for those with kidney problems.  The  fact
    that Dr Kharal is himself  an  Assistant  Professor  of  Urology  at  a
    hospital in Lahore shows that care is available for kidney  conditions.
    Dr Kharal has provided an estimate of the cost of follow  up  treatment
    and medicines which together appear to equate to about �400 every three
    months.

40.   The Respondent  has  also  provided  evidence  of  other  institutions
    throughout Pakistan including a centre in Rawalpindi offering some free
    services for those with kidney problems who are unable to pay for care.
    That is not one  of  the  institutions  which  the  Appellant  says  in
    submissions in reply is no longer in existence.

41.    I  am  unimpressed  by  the  submission  made  in  response  to   the
    Respondent's evidence that, simply because those institutions  did  not
    respond to e mails within a few weeks suggests that the Appellant would
    not be able to access them for treatment.  The e-mails are  written  by
    the Appellant himself who explains his condition, says he  is  resident
    in the UK and has been receiving free medical  care,  asserts  that  he
    will have to return to Pakistan within the next  two  weeks  (which  is
    untrue) and says that  he  cannot  afford  to  pay  for  treatment  and
    monitoring as he is too ill to work  (which  evidence  I  have  already
    rejected).  He therefore asks how he could get access to  free  medical
    care or for an estimate of cost for treatment and how he  might  access
    the Patient Welfare Programme.

42.   This is not an e mail from solicitors asking  for  those  institutions
    to provide evidence as to their services  for  the  purposes  of  these
    proceedings as one might have expected nor is any deadline provided for
    a response to the e mail.  These are no doubt health facilities who are
    busy taking care of patients and might expect that if the writer of the
    e mail is going to be returning to Pakistan as he says, could go  along
    to their  facilities  and  find  out  for  himself  what  treatment  is
    available.  In the absence of  evidence  undermining  the  Respondent's
    evidence or suggesting that it is outdated (other than that two of  the
    facilities are no longer operating), I accept that evidence.

43.   The Appellant has family in Pakistan.  I appreciate that he says  that
    his younger brother who works cannot afford to pay for the  Appellant's
    treatment because he has his mother and younger  sister  to  care  for.
    The Appellant's brother earns approximately R25,000 which the Appellant
    says is just sufficient to cover the family's expenses.   He  does  not
    though say that he could not live with  his  family.   I  have  already
    explained  why  on  the  totality  of  the  evidence,  I  consider  the
    Appellant's assertions that he is unable to work much due to ill-health
    to be exaggerated.  What he says in his statement  is  that  he  cannot
    sing "for too long due to [his]medical conditions" and that  "he  often
    feels weak".  He says that being an entertainer in Pakistan is  a  low-
    ranking job and is not well paid.  He says he would  earn  about  R1000
    per performance (one to one and a half hours).  Even if he is unable to
    work full-time though, even on his own evidence, he  is  not  prevented
    from working at all by his health condition and he does  not  say  that
    work  is  unavailable  in  Pakistan.   On  that  basis,  I  reject  the
    Appellant's evidence that he would not be able to afford to pay for  or
    at least contribute to the cost of his treatment.

44.   For those reasons, I find that  the  Appellant  has  not  demonstrated
    that there is a real risk of  a  breach  of  Article  3  on  return  to
    Pakistan.  He has not shown that his health will suffer to  any  marked
    degree provided that he continues to receive appropriate medication and
    monitoring.  The main drug which the doctors here say is  essential  to
    him is available in Pakistan for a cost which would  be  affordable  if
    the Appellant works and I have indicated why I do not  accept  that  he
    cannot do so.  He can live with his family. Even if, as he asserts, his
    brother cannot afford to help out  with  the  cost  of  treatment,  the
    Appellant would not have to contribute to the cost of accommodation nor
    possibly even such things as food (given that the  Appellant's  brother
    is already having to fund living expenses for two other members of  the
    family).  On the basis of what is said to be available in Pakistan  and
    the cost put forward generally for medication and follow up  treatment,
    the Appellant is likely to be able to afford access to that  treatment.
    The Respondent  has  provided  evidence  which  I  find  persuasive  of
    treatment which is likely to be available to the Appellant irrespective
    of cost if he is unable to pay for it.

Article 8 claim

45.   As the Court of Appeal observed in GS, if an Article  3  claim  fails,
    "Article 8 cannot prosper without some separate or  additional  factual
    element which brings the case within  the  Article  8  paradigm  -  the
    capacity to form and enjoy relationships - or a state of affairs having
    some affinity with the paradigm".  That observation is not affected  by
    the Grand Chamber's judgment in Paposhvili.

46.   GS is however concerned with decisions made before the change  in  the
    Immigration Rules on 9 July 2012 and therefore outside the Rules.   The
    Appellant says that his case meets paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) namely  that
    there are "very significant obstacles to his integration" in Pakistan.

47.   I start by noting that paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) concerns a claim  based
    on a person's private life.  As such,  the  observations  made  by  the
    Court of Appeal in GS still have some relevance.   This  remains  about
    obstacles to integration and  therefore  disruption  to  private  life.
    Further, the threshold set by paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi)  remains  a  high
    one (see by way of example the Court of Appeal's approval of the  Upper
    Tribunal's adoption of those propositions in Secretary of State for the
    Home Department v Kamara [2016] EWCA Civ 813).   This  claim  fails  on
    both counts.  Whilst the  threshold  for  what  are  "very  significant
    obstacles" in the context of Article 8 (which is a qualified right)  is
    not to be equated with whether there is "a real risk" of  ill-treatment
    in the context of Article 3 (which is an absolute right), it remains  a
    high threshold and one which, in terms of the medical health claim, has
    to be considered against the same evidence.

48.   Further, and in any  event,  this  provision  is  about  obstacles  to
    integration (and disruption to private life) not obstacles to accessing
    medical treatment per se.  Whilst I can conceive of cases where lack of
    access to medical treatment could on its own have a  sufficient  impact
    on an ability to integrate where, say, a person does not have any  ties
    in the country of return and would be unable to  form  any  due  to  an
    illness, that is not this case.  The Appellant has family  in  Pakistan
    to whom he can turn.  It is also clear from evidence from  his  friends
    that the Appellant has retained cultural ties to his home country.  His
    friends talk of him being a "valued member of  the  Muslim  community".
    His performances involve recitations of religious hymns in a choir.  He
    is said to be a  "well  known  member  of  the  Shia  Muslim  community
    throughout the UK, commonly  appearing  on  TV  channels".   For  those
    reasons, I find that there are no very  significant  obstacles  to  the
    Appellant's integration in Pakistan.

49.   Finally and for the sake  of  completeness,  I  deal  with  Article  8
    outside the Rules.  As I observe at [13] above, a submission  that  the
    Appellant could succeed  outside  the  Rules  on  the  basis  that  the
    interference with his private life could outweigh the  public  interest
    was not pressed with any great enthusiasm and rightly so.  There can be
    no dispute that  the  Appellant's  Article  8  rights  are  engaged  or
    sufficiently interfered with to require justification.   The  Appellant
    is a single man without family in the UK  who  has  however  been  here
    since (on his last arrival) 2004,  some  thirteen  years  ago  and  has
    formed friendships.  It appears that he arrived  initially  as  a  work
    permit holder (and had also been in the UK previously as a performer in
    2002 but returned to Pakistan). His friends speak of him with affection
    and respect in their statements.  I have dealt above with his  ties  to
    his community in the UK.

50.   As noted above, the Appellant initially came  to  the  UK  as  a  work
    permit holder in 2004.  It is not clear when his leave in that category
    expired but, according to the Respondent's skeleton  argument,  he  has
    overstayed for part of the time.  His status at that time  was  in  any
    event not settled. Further submissions were made and rejected in  2009.
    In 2011, an application was made for him to remain on the basis of  his
    medical condition which had developed whilst in the UK.  He was granted
    three years' discretionary leave to  remain  until  2015.   It  is  the
    refusal of the application for further leave which is  the  subject  of
    this appeal.  The Appellant's residence throughout  the  past  thirteen
    years is therefore in part unlawful and in part precarious.

51.   I have regard to section 117B Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act
    2002.  The Appellant has no basis of stay under the  Immigration  Rules
    (once  his  claim  to  remain  based  on  paragraph  276ADE(1)(vi)   is
    rejected).  It is clear from the medical evidence in this case that the
    Appellant has received a substantial amount of free health care on  the
    NHS including dialysis and a kidney transplant.  The Appellant  is  not
    to be blamed for that (he did  not  come  to  the  UK  seeking  medical
    treatment) but it is relevant to the public interest balance.  That the
    Appellant's status is and has always been precarious and that he has no
    basis of stay under the Rules also lie in favour of the public interest
    in removal.  Maintenance  of  immigration  control  is  in  the  public
    interest and I can give little weight to the Appellant's  private  life
    formed whilst he has not had settled status.   I  do  not  know  if  he
    speaks English.  He appears  to  have  formed  friendships  within  the
    Muslim community but that is not to say that he does not speak English.
     The fact that  he  has  maintained  those  ties  both  linguistic  and
    cultural though does mean that he will be able to more readily adapt to
    life in Pakistan where, as I have already observed he has family ties.

52.   The main factor weighing in favour of the  Appellant  being  permitted
    to remain in the UK is his medical condition.  However, I have  already
    explained why, based on evidence of his condition currently as well  as
    the treatment available in Pakistan, there is no real risk of a  breach
    of Article 3 ECHR.  Based on the same evidence, and  having  regard  to
    the public interest in removal to which I have  referred  above,  I  am
    satisfied that such interference as there will undoubtedly be with  his
    private life including his medical  care  by  removal  to  Pakistan  is
    proportionate.

DECISION
The Appellant's appeal is dismissed on human rights grounds  and  under  the
Immigration Rules

                    ERROR OF LAW DECISION AND DIRECTIONS

                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background

1.    The Appellant is a  national  of  Pakistan  who  appeals  against  the
Respondent's decision dated 6 May 2015 refusing him further leave to  remain
under Article 8 ECHR on the basis of his medical condition and  the  private
life he has formed since arriving in the UK last in  2004.  The  refusal  of
leave to remain followed the grant of a period  of  discretionary  leave  in
2012.   His  appeal  against  that  decision  was  dismissed  by  First-tier
Tribunal Judge G D Tobin in a decision  promulgated  on  9  May  2016  ("the
Decision") on the basis that there were  "no  insurmountable  obstacles"  to
the Appellant returning to Pakistan to continue his  medical  treatment  and
there was no reason to allow the appeal outside the Rules.

2.    The focus of the appeal and the Decision is  the  Appellant's  medical
condition.  He has undergone a kidney transplant in the UK. He continues  to
receive treatment and medication to maintain his  health.   The  Appellant's
solicitors have submitted a recent letter from Dr M Morton, the  Appellant's
consultant nephrologist, which suggests that the Appellant's  condition  has
recently deteriorated but that evidence post-dates the Decision and at  this
stage, I leave it out of account.  The Judge found in the Decision that  the
Appellant had failed to demonstrate that the medication  which  he  receives
is not available in Pakistan.  The  Judge  accepted  that  medical  care  in
Pakistan may not be of the same standard in the UK nor universally  free  at
the point of access.  Nonetheless, the Judge found at [24] of  the  Decision
that the Appellant could access appropriate medication.

3.    Permission was granted by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Pullig  on  19
September 2016 on the basis that the Judge may have  erred  in  taking  into
account evidence relating  to  medication  used  to  treat  those  who  have
undergone liver transplants rather than a kidney  transplant.   In  relation
to the remaining grounds, since those raised  the  issue  of  whether  there
would be "very significant obstacles" to the  Appellant's  reintegration  in
Pakistan, those stood or fell with the ground  relating  to  sufficiency  of
treatment in Pakistan.  The appeal comes before me  to  decide  whether  the
Decision contains an error of law and if so to either re-make  the  decision
or remit the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal for redetermination.

The Rules

4.    The Appellant cannot meet the Rules in relation  to  leave  to  remain
based on his private life unless he  can  satisfy  paragraph  276ADE(1)(vi).
Paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) reads as follows:-

      "Requirements to be met by an applicant for leave  to  remain  on  the
grounds of private life
      276ADE (1). The requirements to be met by an applicant for  leave  to
    remain on the grounds of private life in the UK are that at the date of
    application, the applicant:
      ......
    (vi) subject to sub-paragraph (2), is aged 18 years or above, has lived
    continuously in the UK for less than 20 years (discounting any period
    of imprisonment) but there would be very significant obstacles to the
    applicant's integration into the country to which he would have to go
    if required to leave the UK.

Discussion

8.    Mr Schwenk relied on the Appellant's grounds save in relation  to  one
additional point with which I deal at [13] below.  The first  issue  relates
to whether the Judge erred at [19] to [20] of the Decision in the  reference
to evidence concerning liver transplant medication which  was  not  relevant
to the case and therefore whether he erred in his conclusion  at  [20]  that
"liver transplant medication is readily available in Lahore, at  least."   I
pointed out that this referred to what was produced  to  the  Judge  by  the
Respondent (referred to at [19] of  the  Decision).  It  was  apparent  that
neither Mr Schwenk  nor  Mr  Harrison  had  sight  of  those  documents.   I
therefore gave them both the  opportunity  to  consider  the  two  documents
which I had read.  Those documents consist of two  internet  searches.   The
first relates to the availability of medication, including Prograf which  is
the  focus  of  the  Appellant's  case  that  suitable  medication  is   not
available.  The second relates to a health care centre in Lahore  which  (in
its  own  words)  "helps   patients   undergo   liver   transplant   surgery
successfully."

9.    I indicated to the parties my view that there was  no  error  made  by
the Judge at [20] in the reference to liver transplants rather  than  kidney
transplants.  This did not appear to  me  to  be  a  slip  or  typographical
error.  What the Judge was referring to was the only real evidence which  he
had relating to treatment for transplant patients, namely that  one  of  the
drugs which the Appellant says he could not obtain in  Pakistan  is  clearly
available (albeit probably at a cost) and that there are centres which  help
liver transplant patients and one might therefore expect that they would  be
able to help patients who have undergone other organ transplants.

10.   That evidence stood  to  be  considered  against  what  the  Appellant
himself put forward which the Judge dealt with  at  [10]  of  the  Decision.
That evidence amounted to two documents emanating from Pakistan.  Those  are
summarised by the Judge as being "a letter certifying that a specified  drug
is not available in Pakistan (on untranslated notepaper) and another  letter
from Fazal Din Pharmacy, Lahore, Pakistan certifying that a  specified  drug
is not available in Pakistan." Mr Schwenk accepted that this  was  the  only
evidence produced by the Appellant and (subject to  one  point  to  which  I
refer below at [13]) that the burden of making out his case based  on  human
rights lay  with  the  Appellant.   I  do  not  accept  therefore  that  the
reference to liver transplants rather than kidney  transplants  amounted  to
an error by the Judge.

11.   Based on the two internet searches,  however,  Mr  Schwenk  challenged
the Judge's findings further for the following reasons.  First,  he  pointed
out that the first referred only to the medication  available.   That  makes
no reference to what treatment would be available. Second,  in  relation  to
the information about the health centre, he  pointed  out  that  this  is  a
private clinic and one of the points made by the Appellant is that he  would
be unable to afford treatment.  Mr Schwenk  directed  my  attention  to  the
wealth of evidence from those treating the Appellant in  the  UK  about  the
need for not simply  medication  but  also  regular  checks  and  specialist
treatment.  Without that, the Appellant's  health  would  deteriorate.   The
Judge, he said, had failed to analyse that evidence.

12.   Mr Schwenk also sought to introduce a  further  ground  following  the
recent Grand Chamber case of Paposhvli v Belgium (Application No  41738/10).
 Mr Schwenk readily accepted that this was a case raising  Article  3  ECHR,
that the Appellant's case before the  First-tier  Tribunal  relied  only  on
Article 8 ECHR and that had he been presenting the case before the Judge  at
that stage, he too would have  relied  only  on  Article  8.   He  submitted
however that the landscape  has  changed  as  a  result  of  Paposhvli  both
procedurally and substantively.  By reference to what is said  at  [189]  to
[190] of the Court's assessment, he submitted that this Appellant's case  is
at least potentially a case to which Article 3  could  apply  and  that  the
burden of showing what treatment would be available is no longer  simply  on
the Appellant.

13.    Mr  Schwenk  of  course  accepted  that  this  was  not  one  of  the
Appellant's pleaded grounds - Paposhvli  post-dates  both  the  grounds  and
the grant of permission by a number of months.  He also  accepted  that  the
position at first instance in that case had followed the  previous  line  of
judgments such as N v UK.  He also accepted  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
Judge could not have been expected to follow that decision  since  it  post-
dated the hearing.  He submitted however that the point  was  now  "Robinson
obvious" for me when considering what he  said  was  the  Judge's  error  in
placing the burden on the Appellant to show  that  suitable  medication  and
treatment would not be available  in  Pakistan.   That  was  notwithstanding
that the Appellant's  case  was  pursued  only  under  Article  8  ECHR  and
therefore Paposhvli is not directly on point.  I  observe  also  in  passing
that the Grand Chamber's  decision  also  makes  clear  at  [186]  that  the
initial burden at least lies with the  Appellant  to  show  that  there  are
substantial grounds for believing that he would  be  at  real  risk  of  ill
treatment contrary to Article 3 ECHR on return.

14.    I  had  some  difficulty  following  Mr  Schwenk's  submission   that
Paposhvli is of such relevance and import to the Appellant's  case  that  it
discloses an error of law in the Judge's approach on  a  clear  and  obvious
basis.  In my view, his submission goes nowhere near establishing  the  sort
of clear and obvious point which could be said to be "Robinson obvious".

15.   However, I do not need to decide the point  as  the  remainder  of  Mr
Schwenk's submissions persuade me that there is  an  error  of  law  in  the
Decision and Mr Harrison concedes as much.

16.   Firstly, I accept Mr Schwenk's submission recorded at [11] above  that
the Judge has failed to deal adequately with the evidence  which  there  was
about the treatment which the Appellant requires as opposed  to  simply  the
medication.  There is a wealth of evidence produced by the  Appellant  about
the  treatment  which  he  receives  post  his  transplant  operation.  That
confirms the need for ongoing specialist treatment to  maintain  his  health
(even leaving aside the recent deterioration in his condition).

17.   Secondly, Mr Schwenk drew my attention to  the  manner  in  which  the
Judge has dealt with the question of whether  there  are  "very  significant
obstacles" for the purposes of paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) and  Article  8  more
generally.  Mr Schwenk pointed out that at [23] of the  Decision  the  Judge
has failed to note the other evidence relating to  the  private  life  which
the Appellant has formed in the UK during his thirteen years  of  residence.
Whilst I did not understand Mr Schwenk to submit that this would  of  itself
permit the Appellant to remain, that evidence had to  be  coupled  with  the
evidence in relation to the Appellant's medical condition when dealing  with
Article 8 more generally.  Mr Schwenk pointed out that, although at [5]  and
[22] of the Decision the Judge has correctly directed himself  to  the  test
of "very significant obstacles", at [25] when looking at Article  8  in  the
round, he has resorted to a test  of  "insurmountable  obstacles"  which  is
incorrect.

18.   Mr Harrison for the Respondent conceded that  there  is  an  error  in
relation  to  the  point  recorded  at  [17]   above.    He   accepts   that
"insurmountable obstacles" relies on  the  wrong  test.   He  also  accepted
however in light of that concession that Paposhvli may  have  an  impact  on
this case and would be a factor to be  taken  into  account  going  forward.
He also indicated that, given the complexities of the case, the Decision  is
a short one and fails to adequately deal  with  some  of  the  evidence.  He
therefore conceded that the Decision does disclose a material error of  law.


19.   Both parties agreed that the appeal can remain in the  Upper  Tribunal
for  re-making.   This  is  not  a  case  which  turns  on  any  issues   of
credibility.  As is evident from the foregoing, however, more evidence  will
be required (potentially from both parties) in relation to the  availability
of treatment and medication in Pakistan.   The  parties'  legal  submissions
also need to take into account  the  case  of  Paposhvli  and,  particularly
since this was raised only at the  hearing,  the  Respondent  will  need  to
consider its relevance. Mr Schwenk also asked to be able to raise Article  3
in light of that case.  I indicated that I would not restrict him  doing  so
in his further legal submissions (provided of course that those are  pleaded
in his written submissions so that the Respondent  has  the  opportunity  to
deal with them).  For those reasons, I agreed directions  with  the  parties
which are set out below to lead to a resumed hearing for  the  re-making  of
the Decision.

DECISION

The First-tier Tribunal Decision did involve the making of  an  error  on  a
point of law. I set aside the Decision

In relation  to  the  re-making  of  the  decision,  I  make  the  following
directions:-

    1. By 4pm on Friday 17 March 2017, the Appellant shall file  and  serve
       any additional evidence on which he wishes to rely  in  relation  to
       the re-making of the decision.  That must include but is not limited
       to an updating of evidence in relation to his medical condition  and
       the availability of treatment and medication in Pakistan.
    2. By 4pm on Friday 17 March 2017, the Appellant shall  also  file  and
       serve a skeleton argument setting out his submissions on  the  legal
       issues for the re-making of  the  decision.  For  the  avoidance  of
       doubt, the Appellant is permitted  (if  so  advised)  to  amend  his
       grounds of challenge to include reliance on Article 3 ECHR.
    3. By 4pm on Tuesday 18 April 2017, the Respondent shall file and serve
       any additional evidence on which she wishes to rely in  relation  to
       the re-making of the decision.  That must include but is not limited
       to evidence concerning the availability of treatment and  medication
       for the Appellant's condition in Pakistan.  By the  same  date,  the
       Respondent shall file and serve a skeleton  argument  responding  to
       the Appellant's skeleton argument.
    4. The appeal will be listed for a further oral  hearing  after  2  May
       2017 in either Manchester or Liverpool with a time estimate of three
       hours.   It is anticipated that the hearing  will  consist  or  oral
       submissions only and  that  there  will  not  be  a  need  for  oral
       evidence.  However, if the Appellant wishes to  give  oral  evidence
       and an interpreter is required, the Appellant's solicitors shall, no
       later than fourteen days prior to the date listed for hearing notify
       the Tribunal that an interpreter is required.
    5. The parties may apply to the Tribunal on notice to the  other  party
       if they seek a variation  of  these  directions  or  any  additional
       directions.
