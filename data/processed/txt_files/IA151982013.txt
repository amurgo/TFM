For the Respondent:    Mr I Richards, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a national of Nigeria.   She has been  in  the  United
    Kingdom for about five years now.  She has most recently had leave as a
    Post Study Migrant.  On 5 February 2013, just within the term  of  that
    leave, she made a  further  application  for  leave  to  remain  as  an
    Entrepreneur.  Her application was refused on 29 April 2013.

 2. The reason for the refusal was that the appellant had failed to  comply
    with the requirements of the rules requiring certain  documents  to  be
    supplied with the application; in particular the appellant  had  failed
    to show her active trading by the production of one or more  contracts.
    The requirement to produce contracts was  contained  in  paragraph  41-
    SD(c)(iv) of Appendix A to the  Statement  of  Changes  in  Immigration
    Rules, HC 395 (as amended).  It has been the  subject  of  analysis  by
    this Tribunal in Shebl v SSHD [2014] UKUT 00216 (IAC).   Shebl  pointed
    out that in law a contract is not required itself to be in  writing:  a
    contract is made by offer and acceptance  supported  by  consideration.
    In those circumstances the evidence required by the Secretary of  State
    for contracts could not be assumed to be a requirement to have  written
    contracts.  The only evidence produced by this appellant in support  of
    her application was an invoice, issued by her to a  person  in  Nigeria
    for services costing ï¿½600.  There was no evidence  submitted  with  the
    application of any meeting of minds; there was  no  evidence  that  the
    person in Nigeria had accepted an obligation to pay  for  any  services
    provided by the appellant.  In those circumstances we agree  with  what
    the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  said   at   paragraph   16   of   his
    determination, that is to say that the invoice was no evidence  of  any
    contract.  It was evidence perhaps that the  appellant  sought  payment
    from another individual: but it was no evidence at all of the basis  of
    which she sought payment.

 3. As there was no evidence of any contract, an application for  leave  to
    remain as an entrepreneur could not conceivably be granted.   The First-
    tier Tribunal Judge accordingly made no error of law in dismissing  the
    appeal and we dismiss this further appeal to the Upper Tribunal.
