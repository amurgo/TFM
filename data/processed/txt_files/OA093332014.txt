                                     and



               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr M Marfat, Newcastle Legal Centre
For the Respondent:    Mr J Kingham, Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals with permission against the  decision  of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Stuart P J Buchanan promulgated on  16  June  2015,
    dismissing her appeal against the decision of the respondent to  refuse
    her entry clearance to the United Kingdom as the  spouse  of  a  person
    present and settled here.

 2. The appellant is married to Mr Abdullah Rahman ("the sponsor"), who  is
    settled in the United Kingdom.  She sought permission to join him  here
    on the basis that she met  the  requirements  of  Appendix  FM  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  It is a part of her case that, as at  all  material
    times the  sponsor  was  in  receipt  of  Disability  Living  Allowance
    ("DLA"), it was not necessary for her to show that his earnings in  the
    United Kingdom were at or above the minimum  threshold  of  �18,600  as
    established in paragraph E-ECP.3.1.(a) of the Immigration Rules because
    she is a person to whom E-ECP.3.3 applies.

 3. The appellant was, however,  required  to  show  that  there  would  be
    adequate maintenance  and  accommodation  available  for  her  and  her
    husband; this evidence  had  to  comply  with  Appendix  FM-SE  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  It is said that  the  sponsor's  income  from  DLA,
    Working Tax Credits and employment together with the fact that  he  was
    living in rent-free accommodation, showed that he  could  maintain  and
    accommodate his wife.

 4. The respondent refused the application on the grounds that:-

      i) the appellant had failed to substantiate the  income  from  Working
         Tax Credit because:

          a) documentation  from  the  Department  for  Work  and  Pensions
             ("DWP") confirming receipt of  benefit  in  the  twelve  month
             period  prior  to  the  date  of  application  had  not   been
             submitted; and

          b) personal bank statements for the twelve month period prior  to
             the date of application had not been provided;

     ii) as the income from DLA did not meet the relevant threshold, she was
         not satisfied that the appellant  and  sponsor  would  be  able  to
         maintain and accommodate themselves adequately without recourse  to
         public funds;

    iii) the payslips submitted  from  the  previous  employer  and  current
         employer did not cover the twelve  months  prior  to  the  date  of
         application and were not within the 28 days before the  date;  and,
         no letter  from  the  current  employer  had  been  supplied;  and,
         accordingly, the claimed income of �900  per  month  could  not  be
         taken into account it being noted that the bank statements supplied
         covered only 8 November 2013 to 9 April 2014;

     iv) accordingly,  the  application  was  refused  under  paragraph  EC-
         P.1.1(d) of the Immigration Rules as the documents specified within
         the Immigration Rules had not been provided.

 5. The decision was reviewed by the Entry Clearance Manager on 30  January
    2015 and the decision was upheld, it being concluded also that  it  was
    not a breach of Article 8 of the  Human  Rights  Convention  to  refuse
    entry clearance.

    The hearing before the First-tier Tribunal

 6. The judge heard evidence from the sponsor as well as  submissions  made
    on behalf of the appellant.  He noted [4.3] that the sponsor  had  been
    asked if he had provided documents from HMRC about Working  Tax  Credit
    and said he had provided them to the legal representative but they were
    not used in the application.

 7. The judge found that:-

      i) while the appellant need only satisfy the requirements of  E-ECP3.3
         (not E-ECP3.1) [5.5] paragraph 12A (d) of Appendix  FM-SE  provides
         that evidence of Working Tax Credit must be submitted [5.6];

     ii) whilst the documents submitted after the application in respect  of
         Working Tax Credit may be considered, the material provided  showed
         only that tax credits had been received at a point  in  the  period
         and thus the sponsor could not  by  letter  or  reference  to  bank
         statements show that he had been in receipt of Working  Tax  Credit
         for a period of twelve months as specified in the Rules [5.7];

    iii) while the most recent wage slip and the  letter  from  the  current
         employer were missing [5.8, 5.9], these were documents which  could
         have been called for pursuant to Appendix FM-SE at D;

     iv) while Appendix FM-SE states the decision  maker  will  not  request
         missing documents if addressing the error  or  omission  would  not
         lead to a grant because the application would be refused for  other
         reasons, there was in this case  no  mention  made  of  such  other
         overriding reasons for failing to call for  the  missing  documents
         [5.10] but, as the appellant was unable to claim that  the  sponsor
         was in receipt of Working Tax Credit for the  period  mentioned  in
         paragraph 10 then he could not  satisfy  the  requirements  of  the
         Rules and thus the appeal was dismissed.

 8. The appellant sought permission to appeal on the grounds that the judge
    had erred:-

      i) In not taking into account  all  of  the  evidence  [i];  that  the
         sponsor had provided evidence of  his  employment  [ii];  and,  the
         judge had not taken into account the change in circumstances [iii];

     ii) in confusing at [5.11] the requirement set out in  paragraph  10(f)
         of Appendix FM-SE that the  documents  from  DWP  showed  that  the
         sponsor was in receipt of the benefit in question at a point in the
         twelve month period to the date of application with the requirement
         to provide evidence for a twelve month period of income, the  Rules
         not requiring that the sponsor had received  the  benefit  for  the
         twelve months in question;

    iii) in not considering the relevant  bank  statements  and  tax  credit
         documents even though the respondent  had  failed  to  consider  or
         apply evidential flexibility, this error being material because  it
         was on this basis that the judge had concluded that the failure  to
         apply evidential flexibility to the Working Tax Credit documents on
         the part of the respondent would have made no difference.

 9. On 31 December 2015 First-tier Tribunal Judge Adio  granted  permission
    stating:-

         "It  is  arguable  that  in  view  of  the  lack  of   clarity   in
         interpretation of the Rules contained in the judge's decision on  a
         number of matters there  is  an  arguable  error  of  law  that  is
         apparent in the decision."

The Hearing on 24 February 2016

10. It was agreed that the sponsor was in receipt of DLA and so what had to
    be shown was that there was adequate maintenance and accommodation.  It
    was accepted  also  that  the  relevant  specified  documents  must  be
    provided with the application subject to the applicability of paragraph
    D within Appendix FM-SE.

11. Mr Marfat submitted that it was not necessary for the appellant to have
    shown that the sponsor was earning �900 a month  from  his  wages;  the
    income derived from DLA and Working  Tax  Credits  was,  he  submitted,
    sufficient to show adequacy of maintenance, adequacy  of  accommodation
    not being in issue.  Mr Marfat submitted that the judge's  error  arose
    from a misdirection at paragraph [5.11] and that this had infected  his
    conclusion that the failure to apply the evidential flexibility set out
    in Appendix FM-SE (D) would have made no difference.

12. Mr Marfat submitted that the evidential flexibility requirements  could
    and should have been applied in this case, the omissions  with  respect
    to the bank statements being the omission  of  one  of  a  sequence  of
    documents.

13. For the reasons set out below, I was satisfied that the decision of the
    First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error of law and that his
    decision  insofar  as  it  related  and  that  this  had  infected  the
    apparently  inconsistent  conclusions  at  5.10  and  5.11   thus   the
    conclusion that this is not a  case  in  which  evidential  flexibility
    should be considered was flawed, and thus the decision needed to be set
    aside in part. I heard submissions on that basis.

14. Mr Kingham submitted that there was in this  case  no  basis  in  which
    evidential flexibility is set out in  D  was  relevant,  following  the
    decision  in  Sultana  and  Others  (Rules:  waiver/further  enquiries;
    discretion) [2014] UKUT 00540.  He submitted further that there was  no
    basis, given the numerous defects in the case to submit or  require  to
    be submitted additional documents.

15. Mr Marfat submitted that the evidential flexibility Rule  should  apply
    on the facts of this case.

The Law

16. It is accepted that in order to  obtain  entry  clearance  pursuant  to
    Appendix FM an applicant must provide the specified evidence set out in
    Appendix FM-SE to meet the requirements of the Immigration  Rules,  see
    Appendix FM-SE at A.

17. What specified evidence is required varies according to the  provisions
    of Appendix FM under which an applicant seeks entry or a  variation  of
    leave. In this case, as the sponsor was in receipt of DLA, paragraph E-
    ECP 3.3 applies, and so the specified evidence was required in  respect
    of the financial requirements which are set out at  paragraph  E-ECP3.3
    which provides as follows, so far as is material:

         (b) the applicant must provide evidence that their partner is  able
         to maintain and  accommodate  themselves,  the  applicant  and  any
         dependents adequately in the UK without recourse to public funds

18. It is then necessary to consider what is set out in Appendix  FM-SE  12
    and 12A which provides as follows (so far as is relevant):

         12. Where  a  person  is  in  receipt  of  ...,  Disability  Living
         Allowance, ..., all the following must be provided:

         (a)  Official  documentation  from  the  Department  for  Work  and
         Pensions or Veterans Agency confirming the current entitlement  and
         the amount currently received.

         (b) At least one personal bank statement  in  the  12-month  period
         prior to the date of application showing payment of the  amount  of
         the benefit or allowance to which the person is currently  entitled
         into their account.

         12A. Where the financial requirement the applicant must meet  under
         Appendix FM relates to adequate maintenance,  paragraphs  2  to  12
         apply only to the extent  and  in  the  manner  specified  by  this
         paragraph.  Where  such  a  financial  requirement   applies,   the
         applicant must provide the following evidence:

         (a) Where  the  current  salaried  employment  in  the  UK  of  the
         applicant or their partner, parent, parent's partner or sponsor  is
         relied upon:

             (i) A letter from the employer confirming the employment,  the
             gross annual salary and the annual salary after income tax and
             National Insurance contributions have been paid, how long  the
             employment  has  been  held,  and  the  type   of   employment
             (permanent, fixed-term contract or agency).

             (ii) Payslips covering the period of 6  months  prior  to  the
             date of application or such  shorter  period  as  the  current
             employment has been held.

             (iii) personal bank statement covering the same period as  the
             payslips, showing that  the  salary  has  been  paid  into  an
             account in the name of the person or in the name of the person
             and their partner jointly.

             ...

             (c) Where self-employment in the UK of the applicant or  their
             partner, parent, parent's partner or sponsor, or  income  from
             employment and/or shares in a limited company based in the  UK
             of a type to  which  paragraph  9  applies,  is  relied  upon,
             paragraph 7 or 9 applies as appropriate.

             (d) Where the non-employment income of the applicant or  their
             partner, parent, parent's partner or sponsor is  relied  upon,
             paragraph 10 applies and paragraph 10(f) shall apply as if  it
             referred to any UK welfare benefit or tax credit  relied  upon
             and to HMRC as well as Department for  Work  and  Pensions  or
             other official documentation.

             ...

19.  The requirement to provide the specified documents  is  to  an  extent
    varied by paragraph D which provides as follows:-

         D. (a) In deciding an application in relation to which this
         Appendix states that specified documents must be provided, the
         Entry Clearance Officer or Secretary of State ("the decision-
         maker") will consider documents that have been submitted with the
         application, and will only consider documents submitted after the
         application where sub-paragraph (b) or (e) applies.

         (b) If the applicant:

               i) Has submitted:

                   1) (aa) A sequence of documents and some of the
                      documents in the sequence have been omitted (e.g. if
                      one bank statement from a series is missing);

                   2) (bb) A document in the wrong format (for example, if
                      a letter is not on letterhead paper as specified); or



                   3) (cc) A document that is a copy and not an original
                      document; or

                   4) (dd) A document which does not contain all of the
                      specified information; or

             (ii) Has not submitted a specified document, the decision-
             maker may contact the applicant or his representative in
             writing or otherwise, and request the document(s) or the
             correct version(s). The material requested must be received at
             the address specified in the request within a reasonable
             timescale specified in the request.

         (c) The decision-maker will not request documents where he or she
         does not anticipate that addressing the error or omission referred
         to in sub-paragraph (b) will lead to a grant because the
         application will be refused for other reasons.

         (d) If the applicant has submitted:

             (i) A document in the wrong format; or

             (ii) A document that is a copy and not an original document,
             or

             (iii) A document that does not contain all of the specified
             information, but the missing information is verifiable from:

                  (1) other documents submitted with the application,

                  (2) the website of the organisation which issued the
                      document, or

                  (3) the website of the appropriate regulatory body, the
                    application may be granted exceptionally, providing the
                    decision-maker is satisfied that the document(s) is
                    genuine and that the applicant meets the requirement to
                    which the document relates. The decision-maker reserves
                    the right to request the specified original document(s)
                    in the correct format in all cases where sub-paragraph
                    (b) applies, and to refuse applications if this material
                    is not provided as set out in sub-paragraph (b).

         (e) Where the decision-maker is satisfied that there is a valid
         reason why a specified document(s) cannot be supplied, e.g. because
         it is not issued in a particular country or has been permanently
         lost, he or she may exercise discretion not to apply the
         requirement for the document(s) or to request alternative or
         additional information or document(s) be submitted by the
         applicant.

         (f) Before making a decision under Appendix FM or this Appendix,
         the decision-maker may contact the applicant or their
         representative in writing or otherwise to request further
         information or documents. The material requested must be received
         at the address specified in the request within a reasonable
         timescale specified in the request.

20. In addition it is observed that although paragraph 12A of Appendix  FM-
    SE affects the application of paragraphs 2 to 12 of that Appendix,  the
    provisions of paragraph  1  still  apply.   That  paragraph  sets  out,
    amongst other  things,  the  prescribed  format  and  content  of  bank
    statements.

21. The Immigration Rules make a distinction between what  is  required  to
    show that an individual has been in receipt of a relevant benefit, such
    as DLA, and the Rules as to what evidence is required  to  show  income
    derived from that benefit. In the  case  of  the  former  all  that  is
    required is evidence showing that the  individual  was  in  receipt  of
    benefit at any point in a period of twelve months,  that  is  a  letter
    from the DWP or HMRC and a bank statement  confirming  payment  at  one
    point in that  twelve  month  period.   That  is  contrasted  with  the
    position regarding income.  In  that  case  what  is  required  is,  in
    addition to the letter from DWP or HMRC, a series  of  bank  statements
    covering the whole of the twelve month period.

22. The rationale for the  distinction  is  clear;  it  is  the  fact  that
    somebody who has been awarded a specific  benefit  in  a  period  which
    determines which  provisions  of  the  Immigration  Rules  relating  to
    maintenance (and income) must be  followed.   Similarly,  a  person  in
    receipt of DLA or Working Tax Credits will get an award letter covering
    a period, normally a year.  Evidence that  the  payments  are  made  is
    therefore by reference to deposits into a bank account.

23. In this case it was important to show that the applicant was in receipt
    of DLA, which was accepted, and also  Working  Tax  Credit.   That  the
    sponsor had been awarded both was  not  in  dispute  but  what  was  in
    dispute was the level of the income derived under  Working  Tax  Credit
    which the appellant needed to demonstrate by reference to the specified
    documents in order to prove that there was adequate maintenance.

24. At [5.7] the judge appears to have confused the issue of the  award  of
    Working  Tax  Credit  with  the  income  paid  because  of  the  award.
    Similarly it is  unclear  from  [5.6]  as  to  whether  the  judge  was
    concerned whether there was evidence of income from Working Tax Credits
    or whether there was evidence of the fact that an award had been  made,
    the evidential requirements being different.

25. This confusion need not necessarily have been material.  It is  not  in
    dispute that a full set of bank statements were not provided.  Where it
    is, however, material  is  in  the  judge's  approach  to  whether  the
    respondent erred by failing to consider  whether  additional  documents
    should have been called for, as set out in Appendix FM-SE  at  D.   If,
    which is unclear,  the  judge  was  concerned  with  documents  showing
    receipt of Working Tax Credit rather than that there was income derived
    from it, then his approach to the absence of some  bank  statements  is
    incorrect.  Accordingly, I am satisfied that the error is material  and
    that the decision should be set aside in order to be remade.

26. I am satisfied that  the  appellant  had  not  provided  the  specified
    evidence in respect of the income from Working  Tax  Credit  which  was
    required.  That required the production of the relevant  document  from
    DWP and the production of bank statements covering the whole period  of
    twelve months prior to the date of  application.   Further  it  appears
    from the sponsor's evidence that no document relevant  to  Working  Tax
    Credit had been provided.

27. Whilst I accept that other documents such as those relating  to  income
    from employment were not provided,  it  is  evident  that  it  was  not
    necessary to provide these, given that it was  not  necessary  to  rely
    upon that income to show that there was an adequacy of maintenance.

28. It is at this point pertinent to set out what was set out in Sultana at
    20:-

         20.  We add the following by way of  general  guidance.  When  visa
             applications of this kind are being compiled,  applicants  and
             their advisers must obviously be alert to the totality of  the
             applicable requirements enshrined in Appendix FM-SE. Alertness
             to the various obligatory requirements is obviously essential.
             We would also encourage  applicants  and  their  advisers  who
             consider that any of the discretionary powers conferred on the
             ECO by paragraph [D] should be exercised in  their  favour  to
             proactively make this case when submitting their applications.
             ...

29. Given the acceptance  by  the  sponsor  that  the  Working  Tax  Credit
    documents were not provided and given that this was not raised  in  the
    grounds of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal,  there  appears,  despite
    what was said in Sultana at 20, to be no explanation for the failure to
    produce the relevant documents to the respondent.  Given the failure to
    provide both the document evidencing that there had been  an  award  of
    Working Tax Credit and the documents to show the amount of Working  Tax
    Credit paid, that is the  absence  of  a  substantial  number  of  bank
    statements, I am not satisfied that the respondent erred in failing  to
    exercise discretion in favour of the applicant.  She was not  asked  to
    do so; on the contrary, it was averred  in  the  application  that  the
    documents required had been provided.  No proper explanation for  their
    omission is provided.  It is recalled what was said in Sultana at 25:-

         25. Where a decision is challenged on the  basis  of  an  unlawful
             failure to exercise a discretionary power of  further  enquiry
             or waiver or an unlawful exercise of such power,  Judges  will
             be guided by considering the purpose underlying powers of this
             kind. We consider  that  such  powers  are  to  be  viewed  as
             dispensing provisions, designed to  ensure  that  applications
             suffering from minor defects or omissions which can be readily
             remedied or forgiven do  not  suffer  the  draconian  fate  of
             refusal. In such cases, the  blunt  instrument  of  immediate,
             outright and irrevocable rejection is softened to  accommodate
             applicants  whose  applications  suffer   from   insubstantial
             imperfections which can be easily  and  swiftly  rectified  or
             excused. Furthermore, in our estimation, discretionary  powers
             of further enquiry and waiver promote the valuers of  fairness
             and common sense, while simultaneously minimising  unnecessary
             dominance of and emphasis on bureaucratic formality. They also
             fortify  the  overall  integrity   of   the   United   Kingdom
             immigration system, as expressed in the UKBA letter  dated  19
             May  2011  wherein  the  origins  of  these  powers   can   be
             discovered: see Appendix  A  to  the  decision  of  the  Upper
             Tribunal in Rodriguez (supra). We further  consider  that,  in
             the particular context of paragraph 245AA of  the  Immigration
             Rules, these powers are properly  to  be  viewed  as  measures
             capable of promoting the economic wellbeing of the country and
             should be construed accordingly. Thus the mechanism  initially
             known as "evidential flexibility" and promulgated in a policy,
             now superseded and expressed in more elaborate and  regimented
             terms  in  the  Immigration  Rules,  serves  to   advance   an
             identifiable public interest of some importance. Neither party
             has  in  this  case  provided  the  relevant  instructions  to
             Immigration Officers nor is it suggested that these  would  in
             this case have  the  effect  of  suggesting  that  these  were
             circumstances  in  which  a  discretion   should   have   been
             considered or exercised.

30. Accordingly, for these reasons, although I find that  the  decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal did involve the making of an error of law,  and
    it is set aside, I re-make the decision by dismissing the appeal on all
    grounds, there having been made no submission that the  decision  would
    constitute a breach of the United  Kingdom's  obligations  pursuant  to
    Article 8 of the Human Rights Convention.

SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS


 1. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did involve the  making  of  an
    error of law and I set it aside.  I remake it by dismissing the  appeal
    on all grounds.
