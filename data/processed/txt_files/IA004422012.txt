                            DECISION AND REASONS

PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

1.    In light of the somewhat lengthy procedural history  to  this  appeal,
    it is appropriate that I begin by setting that out.  At the  outset  of
    the hearings before me, the Appellant is the Secretary  of  State,  the
    Court of Appeal having found an error of law in  the  Upper  Tribunal's
    previous decision (see below) and remitted  the  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal for reconsideration.  For ease of reference,  though,  and  in
    light of my decision in relation to  whether  the  original  First-tier
    Tribunal decision contains a material error of law, it is convenient to
    refer to  the  parties  throughout  as  they  were  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

2.    The Respondent's decision under appeal is one dated as long ago as  21
    December 2011 giving notice  of  the  making  of  a  deportation  order
    against the Appellant under the Immigration ((European  Economic  Area)
    Regulations  2006  ("the  EEA   Regulations").    That   decision   was
    supplemented by a decision dated 22 May 2012 confirming the deportation
    order under the EEA Regulations and  also  rejecting  a  human  rights'
    claim under Article 8 ECHR. Although the Appellant  has  also  made  an
    asylum and Article 3 claim, which were the subject of a decision  dated
    24 February 2012 rejecting those claims and certifying the claims under
    section 72(2) Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002,  those
    claims were withdrawn in the course of the First-tier Tribunal  appeals
    and I need say no more about them.

3.    By a decision promulgated on 30 August 2012, a  panel  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal consisting of First-tier Tribunal Glossop and Mr P Bompas
    dismissed the appeal on all grounds.  That decision was  set  aside  by
    Upper Tribunal Judge McGeachy on 12 December 2012 on the basis that the
    Appellant had not been brought to the Tribunal hearing (he was at  that
    time in detention) and there were therefore  agreed  to  be  procedural
    errors.  The appeal was remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be heard
    afresh.

4.    By a decision promulgated on 12 June 2013, a panel of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal consisting of First-tier Tribunal Judge Bartlett and Ms Emblin
    formally dismissed the appeal on asylum and Article 3 grounds (as those
    claims were not by then pursued) but allowed the appeal under  the  EEA
    Regulations on the basis that, although the Appellant was found to be a
    genuine, present and sufficiently serious  threat  at  that  time,  the
    decision  to  deport  him  was  not  proportionate,  having  regard  in
    particular to the lack of prospects of rehabilitation in Lithuania  due
    to the lack of evidence concerning treatment for drug addiction.

5.    Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge  Macleman  in
    the following terms:-

         "It is debatable whether prospective rehabilitation in the UK rules
         out deportation, under the regulations, of a person not  integrated
         in the UK."

6.    The appeal next came  before  the  Upper  Tribunal  (Judges  Warr  and
    O'Connor) on 7 October 2013.  By a decision sent on  14  October  2013,
    they found that the First-tier Tribunal  decision  did  not  contain  a
    material error of law and declined to set that decision aside.

7.    On 16 April 2014, the  Court  of  Appeal  granted  permission  to  the
    Respondent on the basis that the  grounds  were  clearly  arguable  and
    joined the appeal in this  case  with  those  in  LW  (Poland)  and  ME
    (Netherlands).  Those appeals were heard together on 20 and 21  January
    2015 culminating in a judgment of the Court (LJJ Jackson and Floyd  and
    Sir Stanley Burnton) dated  26  February  2015  [2015]  EWCA  Civ  145.
    Although the Court held that the prospects  of  rehabilitation  were  a
    relevant consideration, even  if  an  appellant  were  not  permanently
    resident in the relevant member state, it accepted  the  argument  that
    the weight  given  to  this  factor  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  was
    "manifestly excessive".  Their judgment in relation to this  particular
    appeal is contained in [57] of the judgment as follows:-

         "[57]    In AD, the First-tier Tribunal accepted  that  appropriate
         medical treatment would be available to him in Lithuania, but found
         that no rehabilitative programme for  him,  as  a  recovering  drug
         addict, would be available in Lithuania.  I consider that it  erred
         in so doing.  Appropriate  medical  treatment  could  well  include
         support for his abstinence from hard drugs, and  in  any  event  it
         should not have been assumed that no support  is  available  for  a
         reforming addict.  The Upper Tribunal should not  have  upheld  the
         First-tier Tribunal's  assessment  of  proportionality,  which  was
         flawed for the reason I  have  given.   The  Secretary  of  State's
         appeal should be allowed; the decision of the Upper Tribunal should
         be set aside, and AD's appeal remitted to be  heard  by  the  Upper
         Tribunal afresh, in the light of the latest evidence.  If, while at
         liberty, he has been abstinent, that may indicate that there are no
         longer grounds for his deportation, but that remains to be seen."

    An application for permission to appeal the Court of Appeal's  decision
    was rejected by the Court of Appeal on 9  July  2015  and  the  Supreme
    Court on 3 November 2015.

8.    Following  remittal,  on  21  April  2016,  Mr  Justice  Collins  gave
    directions for the reconsideration of the appeal but recognised at that
    stage that no steps could be taken to obtain up-to-date evidence unless
    and until public funding was made available to the  Appellant  to  fund
    his legal representation.   He  therefore  issued  a  Note  urging  the
    Commission to grant legal aid which it duly did.

9.    The appeal first came before me  on  19  April  2017  for  re-hearing.
    Prior to that hearing, the Appellant's solicitors sought an adjournment
    on the basis that it had not been possible to obtain a  medical  report
    envisaged by Mr Justice Collins' directions.  I agreed to  adjourn  but
    converted the hearing to a CMR and gave directions which were  intended
    to permit a hearing in August 2017.  That hearing, on  8  August  2017,
    also had to be  adjourned  due  to  late  service  of  the  Appellant's
    evidence.  I now have before me an Appellant's  bundle  which  includes
    the Appellant's further evidence to  which  I  will  refer  so  far  as
    necessary, a Respondent's bundle also including  material  to  which  I
    will need to make some  reference  and  written  submissions  for  both
    parties.

10.   Although it  had  been  agreed  at  the  previous  hearing,  that  the
    Appellant would only be required to give  evidence  if  the  Respondent
    gave prior notice of a wish to cross-examine him (which was not given),
    the Appellant's representatives indicated that the Appellant  would  be
    giving oral evidence and was available for  cross-examination  as  they
    realised that the Respondent ought to be given the opportunity to  test
    his evidence.  Given the concerns expressed  by  the  medical  experts,
    particular care was taken when the Appellant gave  evidence  to  ensure
    that the questioning put to him complied with the suggestions  made  by
    the medical expert  and  that  he  was  not  put  under  stress.    The
    Appellant was ably represented by Ms Cohen and I indicated to her  that
    if she had any concerns about the  way  in  which  questioning  of  the
    Appellant was proceeding,  she  should  indicate  that.   She  did  not
    express any concerns.

Error of Law

11.   Given the rather lengthy procedural history to which  I  refer  above,
    it appeared to me that there had never been a re-determination  by  the
    Upper Tribunal whether the First-tier Tribunal's decision contained  an
    error of law.  Both parties agreed that, given what  was  said  by  the
    Court of Appeal in its judgment, it was intended  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's decision should be set aside  for  material  error  and  the
    appeal reconsidered on the basis of the further evidence produced.   Ms
    Cohen urged me to uphold the positive credibility findings made by  the
    First-tier Tribunal  when  considering  the  evidence.   As  Mr  Melvin
    pointed out, though, there is little actual dispute about  credibility.
    The only issue which may turn on my assessment of the  Appellant's  own
    evidence is the  extent  to  which  he  is  a  reformed  character  and
    genuinely intends to desist from further  offending  which  depends  in
    very large part on whether he intends to remain free from  regular  use
    of hard drugs.

12.   In light of the above, I formally find that there is an error  of  law
    in the First-tier Tribunal's  decision  promulgated  on  12  June  2013
    insofar  as  concerns  the  allowing  of  the  appeal  under  the   EEA
    Regulations.  I therefore set aside the decision insofar as  it  allows
    the appeal on that ground.  The appeal on  protection  grounds  remains
    dismissed as it was not pursued at that time and the dismissal has  not
    been challenged.  I turn then to the re-making of the decision.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND THE APPELLANT'S EVIDENCE

13.   The Appellant is a national of Lithuania.  He arrived in the UK on  22
    May 1998 with six months leave as a visitor.  On 24  January  1999,  he
    claimed asylum.  In 2009,  the  Respondent  invited  the  Appellant  to
    withdraw his asylum claim following the accession of Lithuania  to  the
    European Union in 2004.  He did not respond. He was  interviewed  about
    his claim in January and February 2012 and that claim was refused.   As
    already noted, that claim is no longer pursued.

14.   Prior to coming  to  the  UK,  the  Appellant  suffered  a  number  of
    traumatic events.  He had a difficult childhood  due  to  an  alcoholic
    father and domestic violence in  his  parents'  relationship.   On  one
    occasion, his father hung him upside down from a balcony and threatened
    to allow him to drop in order to torment his mother.  Fortunately,  his
    mother was able to enlist the  authorities'  assistance  and  separated
    from and then divorced  his  father.  However,  as  a  result  of  what
    occurred, the Appellant suffered panic attacks  and  was  referred  for
    psychiatric  help  and  prescribed  anti-depressants.   He  had  though
    recovered in the main by the age of twelve years and did  well  in  his
    education.

15.   The Appellant suffered what is probably the main  traumatic  event  in
    his life though, during his national service in 1984 to 1986.   He  was
    sent to fight in Afghanistan.  During  one  particular  operation,  his
    friend was killed whilst sitting beside the Appellant.   The  Appellant
    tried to rescue his friend from underneath a vehicle when  the  vehicle
    in which they were travelling  was  hit  by  a  propeller  grenade  and
    overturned.   His  description  of  this  event  in  his  statement  is
    particularly gruesome and I do not need to include detail.  Suffice  it
    to say, it is entirely  understandable  that  the  Appellant  would  be
    traumatised by what occurred.

16.   After that event and for the remainder of his service in  Afghanistan,
    the Appellant turned to hard drugs to help  him  cope.   He  says  that
    everyone in the regiment was taking heroin and he moved on to that from
    the painkilling medication which he used initially to relax him.  After
    six months, he was addicted to heroin.

17.   The Appellant had  married  in  Lithuania  immediately  prior  to  his
    national service.  He and his wife had two  children,  a  son  born  in
    August 1984 and a daughter born in April  1986.   He  returned  to  his
    family at the end of his national  service  but  remained  addicted  to
    drugs.  His statement outlines  a  number  of  occasions  when  he  has
    undergone detox attempts, including when in Lithuania.  However,  those
    have not in the past worked and he has relapsed.  As a  result  of  his
    addiction, the marriage broke down and he  and  his  wife  divorced  in
    1991.  She has since remarried.  The Appellant had  free  accommodation
    as a war veteran but allowed his wife and children to retain  the  flat
    and he moved out.

18.   In the meanwhile, the Appellant, following national service, tried  to
    return to work as an electrician.  He could not  however  hold  down  a
    job.  A friend suggested that they start up a business together and the
    Appellant agreed.  They started the business in  1987.   However,  they
    became the target of criminal gangs seeking "protection"  money.   They
    refused to pay and the Appellant was attacked.  He reported the attacks
    to the police.   The  gang  members  were  prosecuted.   The  Appellant
    testified against them.  They were sent to prison in 1988 but vowed  to
    seek revenge on the Appellant.  Two of their number  were  released  in
    1997 and the Appellant and others who had testified  against  the  gang
    were subjected to various threats and harassed.

19.   The Appellant's business partner was found  hanged  in  October  1997.
    The Appellant believes that he was killed.  As a result,  he  moved  to
    stay with friends in Vilnius.  Whilst he was living there, his  friends
    moved to the UK and suggested in 1998 that the  Appellant  should  join
    them.  The Appellant did  not  come  to  the  UK  directly  but  rather
    travelled round Europe,  apparently  to  avoid  exciting  suspicion  on
    entry. He arrived in the UK as part of an organised tour  in  May  1998
    since when he has not left.

20.   Since his arrival in the UK,  the  Appellant  has  amassed  a  lengthy
    criminal record comprising one offence against the person, twelve theft
    and kindred offences, one offence relating to police, courts,  prisons,
    one drugs offence, six firearms and  offensive  weapons  offence.   The
    index offence in respect of which the deportation decision was taken is
    a conviction for robbery on 8 June 2010 for  which  the  Appellant  was
    sentenced to three years and six months'  imprisonment.  The  following
    account of that offence is taken from the Judge's sentencing remarks:-

         "... you pleaded guilty at the first  available  opportunity  to  a
         robbery of a lady of sixty who was the sole occupant of her shop as
         she opened it in the morning.  She hadn't even managed to open  the
         shutters fully and, indeed, as soon as you got in  the  front  door
         shut and you could only have got out with her  assistance,  as  you
         did.  Nonetheless you sought to attack her, pushing her and shoving
         her and making her give you assistance  to  help  yourself  to  the
         till.  You took about �150 to  �200  from  her  till,  pushing  her
         through the back door and into the  storeroom  at  one  stage,  but
         because you couldn't get out you had to get her assistance and as a
         result you let her out too.  Both of you ran out into  the  market.
         She got the assistance of the  traders  who  detained  you  briefly
         before you managed to escape.  You were drunk..."

21.   As the Judge observed in sentencing, the majority of  the  Appellant's
    offending "possibly  arises"  from  drug  abuse.   As  the  Judge  also
    observed though, the Appellant had been given previous opportunities to
    cease offending including a drug treatment and testing order  in  2004.
    He had however relapsed in 2008 and returned to his  offending  pattern
    in 2009.  The Appellant in his statement attributes this relapse to the
    breakdown of a relationship he entered into, it appears, in about 2006.



22.   I have  already  set  out  in  the  above  section  dealing  with  the
    procedural  history  what  happened  thereafter   in   terms   of   the
    Respondent's decisions and this appeal.  Subsequent to the  Appellant's
    conviction and the Respondent's decision, the Appellant was released on
    bail from immigration detention on 9 December 2013.  The Appellant  was
    at the time following a methadone programme (as he has done for most of
    the period since 1999).  He initially moved in  with  his  friend  Tony
    Read.  However, his friend sadly died on 8 December 2015.   His  mother
    also sadly died on 2 November 2015.

23.   The Appellant attributes a lapse into drug taking in December 2015  to
    those events.  However, he says that he only  took  drugs  (heroin  and
    crack cocaine) for a few days.  He also lapsed in  December  2016.   He
    attributed that lapse to the anniversary of the  deaths  which  I  have
    mentioned and that he was in pain due to arthritis.   He  said  in  his
    oral evidence that he had not paid for the drugs; they  were  given  to
    him by a friend.  He recognised however that even possessing such drugs
    is contrary to the law in the UK.  He said that he very much  regretted
    these lapses.  He explained to me, however, that there is a  difference
    between a lapse which is short  term  and  a  full-blown  relapse  into
    addiction.

24.   The  Appellant's  latest  witness  statement  and  his  oral  evidence
    indicate that, with the exception of those lapses, he has remained free
    from hard drug abuse since his release  from  detention  and  obviously
    since his conviction in 2010. I should note though that there has  been
    no further offending since the  Appellant's  conviction  in  July  2010
    although Mr Melvin did rely, as he was obviously entitled to do, on the
    fact that the Appellant has broken the law since even if not prosecuted
    or convicted of offending, by the possession  and  taking  of  Class  A
    drugs.

25.   One final matter which I need to mention under  this  heading  is  the
    Appellant's relationship with his family and friends.  The  Appellant's
    son lives in the UK and is married with a child.  At the  time  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal's decision, the Appellant remained in contact  with
    his son and his  desire  to  re-establish  contact  with  his  son  and
    grandchild following his release from prison was  one  of  the  factors
    relied  upon  by  the   Tribunal   as   encouraging   the   Appellant's
    rehabilitation.  There has though since that  time  been  a  change  in
    circumstances.  The Appellant's daughter continues to live in Lithuania
    and the Appellant says that his relationship with her is not as good as
    with his son. The last time he spoke to  her  was  before  he  went  to
    prison in 2010 and she does not reply to text messages.

26.   Since the Appellant's mother died  in  Lithuania,  there  has  been  a
    dispute between the Appellant and his daughter due to the terms of  his
    mother's will.   It  appears  that  the  Appellant  asked  his  son  to
    intervene in this regard when his son visited Lithuania in 2016 but his
    son told him that the Appellant's mother had  left  everything  to  the
    Appellant's son and daughter and there was nothing which could be done.
     Since then, the Appellant  says  that  his  son's  contact  grew  less
    frequent until it stopped at the end of 2016.  The Appellant also  says
    that he has lost his phone and  has  therefore  lost  all  his  contact
    numbers.  Although his solicitors had his son's number,  his  son  does
    not answer the phone.

27.   The Appellant also has cousins in Lithuania  but  he  says  he  cannot
    turn to them for assistance if he were to return.   They  do  not  have
    enough to live on.  One is disabled and cannot look after herself.  The
    other lives with her daughter and grandchild in a one-bedroom flat.

28.   The Appellant is currently living with  friends.   He  indicated  that
    both are disabled.  He is living in their accommodation.  He  does  not
    know if they have their landlord's permission for him  to  live  there.
    He said that if he had to leave  that  accommodation,  though,  he  has
    other friends with whom he would be able to stay.

29.   The Appellant sells the Big Issue.  He indicated in his evidence  that
    he works five to  seven  days  per  week  and  sells  thirty  to  forty
    magazines.  He sells each for �2.50 and pays �1.25 so  he  earns  about
    �37.50-�50 per week.  According to an e mail from the  London  Regional
    Manager, the Appellant began selling the Big Issue on 7  December  2016
    following a twenty months' absence.  The  Appellant  said  in  evidence
    that it was less than that and that there may be a discrepancy in  that
    period because he could not always afford to renew his  badge  so  that
    central records might not reflect the reality  of  the  situation.   Ms
    Cohen did suggest in submissions that the period could  not  be  twenty
    months given the Appellant's date of release but I did not  follow  her
    logic.  The Appellant had been at liberty for about three years when he
    re-started selling the Big Issue.  It could  therefore  easily  be  the
    case that he had stopped doing so for twenty months.

30.   The point is not though of any particular importance; it  is  not  for
    example  suggested  that  this  period  of   employment   changes   the
    Appellant's rights under EU law.  Mr Melvin sought to suggest in cross-
    examination that the Appellant has started to sell the Big Issue  as  a
    means to asserting that he is employed and  is  therefore  entitled  to
    certain in-work benefits.   The  Appellant  denied  this  and  appeared
    genuinely  confused  as  to  why  this  should   change   any   benefit
    entitlement. I am persuaded he was telling the truth  about  this.    I
    also note that the Appellant is  in  receipt  of  the  lowest  rate  of
    Disability Living Allowance for an indefinite  period  at  the  current
    rate of �22 per week. I was not though shown any assessment  about  the
    reason for this allowance or what any disability entails.

31.   The evidence that the Appellant is selling the  Big  Issue  is  though
    relevant to his progress and desire to change.  He gave evidence  that,
    through this job, he has made contacts within the community.  He  talks
    to others and is able to talk to them about his  past.   He  speaks  to
    some people on a regular basis. He says that people  in  the  community
    "love" him.  He considers that this job is also allowing him to make  a
    contribution to the community.  He gave an  example  of  seeing  people
    trying to steal from other people when he is on the streets selling the
    magazine and intervening to stop them.

EXPERT AND OTHER THIRD-PARTY EVIDENCE

Medical Evidence

32.   The Appellant relies on two medical experts.  The first,  Dr  Jennifer
    Drife, is a consultant psychiatrist.  Her report is dated  15  February
    2017 and follows an examination on 20 January 2017.  She  concurs  with
    the previous  mental  health  diagnosis  of  Dr  Joanna  Dow  that  the
    Appellant suffers from some symptoms of Post- Traumatic Stress Disorder
    but  does  not  currently  reach  diagnostic  criteria  for  the   full
    condition.

33.    In  terms  of  previous  intervention  for  his  mental  health,  the
    Appellant reported to Dr Drife that, in addition to being admitted to a
    psychiatric hospital in Lithuania for one week when he was  aged  eight
    or nine for reasons to which  I  have  already  alluded,  he  was  also
    admitted as an inpatient for around five weeks in Lithuania  about  two
    years after  he  returned  from  Afghanistan.   During  that  time,  he
    underwent  detox  treatment  for   his   heroin   addiction   and   his
    antidepressant medication was changed.

34.   The Appellant attended Homerton Hospital for weekly  sessions  with  a
    psychologist for six or seven months in 2009.  This was to  tackle  his
    drug abuse and his PTSD symptoms. According to Dr Drife's review of the
    Appellant's medical records, the Appellant was also seen by a  clinical
    psychologist in 2006 at  the  Hackney  Specialist  Addiction  Unit  and
    received 22 sessions of cognitive behavioural therapy.

35.   The Appellant reported to Dr Drife that he had made three attempts  at
    suicide - twice by an attempted overdose when he returned to  Lithuania
    after national service and once by trying to cut his own throat when on
    remand in Brixton in 2010.

36.   In terms of drug abuse, Dr Drife notes that  the  Appellant  has  been
    treated with methadone since 1999. At  the  time  of  her  report,  the
    Appellant had reduced his methadone dose to 25mg daily.   Although  the
    Appellant had started this treatment in May 1999,  he  had  reduced  to
    zero in August 2000 but restarted in August and then December 2001  and
    remained on methadone until his arrest and thereafter.  In addition  to
    the use of heroin and crack  cocaine,  the  Appellant  also  records  a
    history of alcohol use.

37.   The Appellant has a history of  high  blood  pressure,  arthritis  and
    hepatitis C.  Dr Drive reports that the Appellant said  that  his  main
    physical problem  is  the  arthritis.   The  Appellant  has  also  been
    prescribed antidepressants and medication to help him sleep.

38.   As Mr Melvin observed  in  submissions,  the  purpose  of  Dr  Drife's
    report appears to be to support a claim for  unlawful  detention  which
    the Appellant has been pursuing.

39.   The Appellant also relies on a report of Mr John Cordwell, a  forensic
    psychologist who has prepared a report dated 28 June 2017 following  an
    assessment on 29 April 2017 which lasted  for  four  hours  and  thirty
    minutes.  Mr Cordwell has also provided a supplementary letter dated 10
    October 2017 in response to a request to update his assessment based on
    changed circumstances and other evidence.

40.   Given the reliance placed by the Appellant on Mr Cordwell's  evidence,
    it is worth setting out in full his summary assessment:-

         "[1.2]   Mr Dumbliauskas is intelligent, resilient, self-reflective
         and open to understanding his needs.  He is however  an  individual
         who suffers with depression, and who has a longstanding heroin  and
         alcohol  addiction  that  is  currently  in  remission.   He   also
         continues to experience several residual symptoms of post traumatic
         stress disorder that are closely interlinked with his  feelings  of
         low mood, worry and his  strong  sense  of  shame  and  guilt.   Mr
         Dumbliauskas does re-experience his previous trauma  from  time  to
         time, but more regularly tends  to  ruminate  about  his  sense  of
         sadness, loss and guilt.  His sense of self-worth  and  self-esteem
         is fragile, he often feels inadequate and not good enough  and  has
         described a sense of shame and guilt about his  previous  drug  use
         and his previous offending behaviour.   This  sense  of  shame  and
         guilt can make him more vulnerable to struggling  to  tolerate  and
         manage the distress associated with the trauma  symptoms,  and  any
         difficulties he does have in  managing  the  resurgence  of  trauma
         symptoms can make him more vulnerable to using substances, to  cope
         with negative emotional states and life stressors.   As  such,  any
         relapse into a more frequent or persistent use  of  substances  (ie
         either street heroin or alcohol misuse) will  potentially  increase
         his risk of acquisitive offending to support this need.

         [1.3]    Mr  Dumbliauskas  does  not  currently  demonstrate  overt
         criminal thinking styles, although these have been evident  in  the
         past.  He has not tended to rationalise or justify his actions, and
         he wants to be able to work towards an offending free and substance
         free lifestyle with support from professional services.   It  is  a
         reasonable hypothesis to suggest that his acquisitive offending was
         financially motivated, driven by a need to purchase substances, but
         also day to day living because most  his  finances  were  spent  on
         heroin.  Likewise we can hypothesise that his use of substances was
         underpinned by a powerful need to  cope  with  and  manage  intense
         negative emotional  states  associated  with  both  this  PTSD  (ie
         detachment and avoidance distraction)  but  also  general  sadness,
         shame and guilt often associated with both pervasive depression and
         also PTSD experiences.

         [1.4]    Mr  Dumbliauskas'  current  assessment  of  general  (non-
         violent  recidivism)  was  assessed  using  the  Level  of  Service
         Inventory:  Case  Management  Index  (LS-CMI;  Andrews,  Bonta,   &
         Wormith, 2011).  This assessment indicates that he is  currently  a
         'Medium Risk' level (ie total LSI-CMI score of 17, with the  medium
         risk range being 11-19) at this time.  Notwithstanding, the  LS-CMI
         identifies  a  number  of  factors  that  are  regarded  as   being
         "strengths" or protective factors, including  for  Mr  Dumbliauskas
         some positive pro-social friends, few current  criminal  associates
         and no current overt/entrenched pro-criminal attitudes  or  values.
         Importantly, aspects identified within  this  assessment  that  are
         more likely to be associated with  a  risk  of  committing  further
         offences  include;  (1)  his  frequent  use  of   substances;   (2)
         employment and financial difficulties and (3)  needing  to  have  a
         more rewarding use  of  his  spare  time.   This  is  also  further
         supported by the assessment of  there  being  a  moderate  to  high
         presence of protective factors, ie as evidenced by  the  Structured
         Assessment of Protective Factors (SAPROF; De Vogel  et  al,  2012).
         Additionally, the most recent OASys Assessment (dated May 2012) can
         be used to inform Mr Dumbliauskas' level of  risk  of  reoffending.
         This Assessment places Mr Dumbliauskas  as  being  a  low  risk  to
         children and any known others, but a medium risk to the public.  In
         my opinion because of the number of protective factors present, and
         given that there has been a  marked  lack  of  offending  behaviour
         since  release  from  prison   (including   whilst   having   taken
         substances), the OASYs and the LS-CMI represent an over  estimation
         of his risk of general offending and of his risk of harm to others.

         [1.5]    It is important to note that, in my opinion, given the low
         presence of  treatment  needs  and  high  relevance  of  protective
         factors for him, the potential risk of Mr Dumbliauskas engaging  in
         future acquisitive offending behaviour  is  low.   Any  risk  would
         largely be accounted  for  by  a  relapse  into  a  more  pervasive
         substance misuse, ie either street heroin use or a  more  sustained
         and prolonged alcohol misuse.  It is my opinion that his risk  will
         be considerably reduced should he be able to  continue  manage  his
         alcohol intake, desist  from  substance  use  (ie  street  heroin),
         maintain contact  with  substance  misuse  services,  and  maintain
         meaningful vocational and occupational activities.

         [1.6]    It is my opinion that  Mr  Dumbliauskas  experiences  some
         residual   posttraumatic   stress   related   symptoms   that   are
         interrelated  with  symptoms  of   depression.    Importantly,   Mr
         Dumbliauskas  is  motivated  to  understand   his   mental   health
         difficulties and to learn to manage these  better,  and  it  is  my
         opinion that he would benefit from psychological treatment to  help
         him to manage his trauma  symptoms  as  well  as  the  interrelated
         experiences of ongoing depression, and  the  underlying  guilt  and
         shame that perpetuates this.  Mr Dumbliauskas would benefit from  a
         referral to his local NHS Adult Mental Health  Service  (AMHT),  or
         Psychological Therapies Service (IAPT)."

41.   Mr Cordwell is well-placed to carry out the assessment which  he  does
    not only of the Appellant's mental health condition and what  treatment
    might benefit him but also of the risk which he  currently  poses.   Mr
    Cordwell has experience in assessing risk within HM Prison  system  and
    supervising others carrying  out  those  assessments.   He  has  worked
    mainly for the NHS including in providing psychological assessments  of
    risk and treatment need for violent and sexual offenders detained under
    the Mental Health Act.  He also assesses individuals living  in  secure
    settings and the community.  He works alongside the National  Probation
    Service providing teaching, training and consultancy in complex  cases.
    His opinion based on that experience and  expertise,  is  deserving  of
    significant weight.

42.   I do not set out  the  substance  of  Mr  Cordwell's  report  but  the
    following elements of the report are worthy of mention.  First,  it  is
    clear that Mr Cordwell is well aware that the  Appellant  has  suffered
    the occasional lapse into substance abuse ([5.5.6]).   As  Mr  Cordwell
    notes at [5.5.15], the Appellant did  not  commit  any  further  crimes
    during those lapses and the lapses were short  in  duration.   As  also
    there noted, the Appellant has  suffered  from  financial  difficulties
    since his release but has not turned to  crime  to  obtain  money.   In
    short summary of the internal and external  protective  factors  relied
    upon by Mr Cordwell at [6.2] of  his  report,  it  is  noted  that  the
    Appellant displays empathy, that coping and self-control  is  partially
    present although undermined by his lapses, that  he  is  motivated  for
    treatment and seeking out help and medication (such  as  methadone)  to
    cope with his addiction, that he has friends with whom he  is  able  to
    stay and that these friends are non-drug  users.  The  risk  management
    factors based on the  Appellant's  history  are  antisocial  behaviour,
    substance use and major mental disorder ([6.3.7])

43.   As Mr Cordwell records  at  [6.3.8],  the  Appellant  has  never  been
    convicted of  a  violent  offence  although  there  was  some  violence
    involved in the index offence.  For that reason, Mr  Cordwell  assesses
    that the risk of violence is low.  It is  though  recognised  that  the
    Appellant has "a marked number of reckless and  impulsive  pro-criminal
    acquisitive and general antisocial behaviours, mostly  associated  with
    pro-drug use and with pro-criminal peers".  Mr Cordwell notes that  the
    Appellant is not an aggressive person, that he  expresses  remorse  for
    past conduct and has insight into his condition and in  particular  his
    addiction as well as a willingness to engage with  those  helping  him,
    particularly his key worker.

44.   Mr Cordwell was also asked to comment on  the  likely  impact  of  the
    Appellant's return to Lithuania which he does at [8.5.1] of his  report
    as supplemented in his letter of 10 October 2017. He opines that  there
    will not be the professional and social structures in place  there  but
    does not say on what evidence he bases  that  conclusion.   Nor  is  it
    clear what experience he has of services in Lithuania on which he bases
    his opinion that the mental health services, social  and  psychological
    support will not be readily available. He relies in his  letter  of  10
    October on the report of Ms Poskeviciute and I will deal with  that  in
    further detail when I turn to look at the evidence  about  availability
    of treatment in Lithuania.

45.   I can though readily accept  Mr  Cordwell's  opinion  that  return  to
    Lithuania would cause some emotional and psychological  disturbance  to
    the Appellant's mental health given the trauma which, at least to  some
    extent, he associates with that country. The point  which  Mr  Cordwell
    makes in his most recent letter that he would lack  social  and  family
    support, accommodation and income on return is also one which I have to
    consider when looking at the proportionality of return.

46.   In his most  recent  letter,  Mr  Cordwell  has  also  considered  the
    Appellant's  change  in  living  circumstances   ie   his   change   in
    accommodation and whether that would  impact  on  assessment  of  risk.
    Although Mr Cordwell records the Appellant's evidence that he  did  not
    want to move, he also notes that the Appellant is happy living with the
    friends with whom he lives with currently.  Mr Cordwell  assesses  that
    there is no escalation of risk associated with  the  move;  indeed,  he
    considers that the move "seems to represent an adaptive problem-solving
    strategy, and one where [the  Appellant]  has  aimed  to  keep  himself
    safe".

Key Worker: Theresa Hibbert

47.   Ms Hibbert is a Recovery Practitioner  working  for  Hackney  Recovery
    Service and the Appellant's key worker in  relation  to  his  drug  and
    alcohol use.  She has provided evidence in  the  form  of  two  letters
    dated 22 August 2016 and 11 October 2017.  The  first  confirms  simply
    that she has been the Appellant's key worker for  two  years  and  that
    during that time, the Appellant has  gained  employment  and  has  been
    reducing his methadone dose.  She says that this is "an indication that
    he is doing well".

48.   The second letter contains greater detail.  Ms Hibbert  confirms  that
    the Appellant meets with her once  every  four  weeks  to  discuss  his
    situation  and  review  his  progress.   Ms  Hibbert  refers   to   the
    Appellant's lapse in  December  2016  but  confirms  that  he  has  not
    relapsed into intravenous drug use and  has  remained  abstinent  since
    that time and continued to engage  with  the  recovery  service.    The
    Appellant remains on methadone but his dosage is now 22ml per  day  and
    that is being reduced by 1ml following each meeting  with  the  aim  to
    reduce it to 20ml after which it is intended that he will attend a "Low
    Dose group" for support in reducing it further. The remainder  of  that
    letter deals with a point about medication  in  Lithuania  and  I  will
    therefore deal with that below under that head.

49.   Under cover  of  Ms  Hibbert's  first  letter,  she  attaches  a  risk
    assessment review carried out on 14 December 2016.  That sets  out  the
    historic factors which contribute to the risk which the Appellant posed
    and may continue  to  pose.   Mr  Melvin  also  expressly  directed  my
    attention to the reference to the lapse which the Appellant reports  as
    follows:-

         "Reports his arthritis is causing pain which has led  to  lapse  in
         drug use.  Iv heroin smoke crack."

    It is noted that the Appellant refused an urine screen.

Medication and support services in Lithuania

50.   No doubt as a result of what was said by the  Court  of  Appeal  about
    the lack of evidence of  what  treatment  might  be  available  to  the
    Appellant in Lithuania, both parties have produced evidence about this.



51.   The Respondent relies on an e mail exchange  with  Ms  R  Cizauskaite,
    who  is  a  worker  with  the  charity,  Caritas.   That  charity   was
    recommended by the British Embassy in Vilnius as being able  to  answer
    the queries about the availability of social benefits and treatment for
    deportees from the UK.  Caritas is said by the Embassy official  to  be
    one which specialises in "reintegration of  convicts  who  have  served
    their  sentence  in  prison  and  are  facing  all  kind   of   social,
    psychological, health and financial difficulties  when  starting  their
    new life after imprisonment."

52.   Mr Melvin's e mail to Ms Cizauskaite sets  out  the  circumstances  of
    the Appellant's case including his  mental  health,  alcohol  and  drug
    dependency issues, that he has a  criminal  history  for  mainly  minor
    offences and has been in and out of prison and  that  although  he  has
    family in Lithuania, he claims that they will not be  able  to  support
    him.  Ms Cizauskaite was asked a number of questions which  I  set  out
    below along with her answers (underlined):-

         "1.      What support and treatment is available in Lithuania to  a
         returning national in these circumstances?

              There are no special programmes in Lithuania concerning these
              particular issues.

         2. Would he be able to access methadone/substitution treatment?

              There is a possibility to have access to methadone (a  person
              must pay for health insurance every month or be registered in
              Lithuanian Labour Exchange to be able  to  use  free  medical
              care).  For more information, check the link below.

              http://vplc.lt/farmakoterapija

         3. Given his absence from Lithuania for a considerable  time  would
         he be able to access healthcare and social welfare?

              After he is registered to Lithuanian Labour Exchange, he will
              be able to use social benefits.

         4.  Would  there  be  any  support  to   enable   him   to   access
         accommodation?

              Temporary accommodation would be provided by CARITAS.

         5. He has a limited employment history in the UK on account of  his
         methadone treatment but appears keen to be employed.

              If he has motivation, CARITAS and Lithuanian Labour  Exchange
              would help him find a job that would suit his abilities."

53.   The Respondent has also provided an extract from the  website  of  the
    Vilnius Center for Addictive Disorders.  That centre is said to be  the
    country's "largest  healthcare  and  psychosocial  support  centre  for
    people whose lives are affected by drug, alcohol or  tobacco  addiction
    issues".  The  centre  has  professionals  working  for  it  -  medical
    doctors, psychologists and social workers.  It is said to have a  "wide
    range of treatment and  rehabilitation  services"  in  three  different
    locations within Vilnius.   The  centre  also  provides  education  and
    training.  It has the status of  "Regional  United  Nations  Office  on
    Drugs and Crime (UNODC) Training Centre for the Baltic countries".   It
    is also an associate member of TREATNET - International Network of Drug
    Dependence Treatment and Rehabilitation Resource Centres.

54.   According to a further extract from its website, treatment is  offered
    to outpatients in the following way:-

         "After registering for  treatment  patients  are  referred  to  the
         Outpatient Unit.  A team of psychiatrists, psychologists and social
         workers  provide  the  patient  with  primary  medical  assessment,
         consult and discuss  options  of  treatment,  draft  an  individual
         treatment and support plan based on the patient's  preferences  and
         doctor's recommendations.  Referrals to other Units are also issued
         here.  There is a number of other services available in  the  Unit,
         such  as  outpatient  treatment  of  alcohol  withdrawal  syndrome,
         medication-assisted opioid addiction treatment and drug testing for
         adolescents, which is available 24 hours a day."

55.   The centre also has  a  Psychosocial  Rehabilitation  Unit,  Day  Care
    Centre which provides the following services:-

         "Day Care centre specialises in treatment of  substance  addictions
         and  patients'  social  adaptation.   A   team   of   psychiatrist,
         psychologist, social worker and a  nurse  work  with  our  patients
         throughout the opioid withdrawal,  seeking  to  motivate  them  for
         further  treatment  and  to  prevent  relapse.   Patients   receive
         information on symptoms of addiction, the course  of  the  disorder
         and  possible  treatment  options,  they  also  learn   to   better
         understand their emotions and reinforce positive behaviour.  Family
         involvement  is  important  in  substance  abuse  treatment,   thus
         consultations with emphasis on relapse  prevention  are  available.
         The treatment is available to patients  18  years  old  and  older.
         Length of treatment is 30 successive days.  Services  are  free  of
         charge unless stated otherwise..."

56.    The  Social  Support  Unit   offers   medication   and   psychosocial
    counselling.  There is  an  alcohol  withdrawal  treatment  unit  which
    offers an inpatient service for up to 14  days.   The  drug  withdrawal
    treatment and psychosocial rehabilitation unit  also  offers  inpatient
    medication-assisted withdrawal for  up  to  15  days  and  psychosocial
    rehabilitation up to 50 hours.  All treatment is said to be free.

57.   Ms Cohen criticised Ms Cizauskaite's evidence because it comes in  the
    form of an e mail and is not therefore  a  report  compliant  with  the
    practice direction on expert evidence.  I do not accept that submission
    for two reasons.  The first is that her evidence is mainly a matter  of
    fact about what treatment is available  rather  than  a  report  of  an
    expert about this particular Appellant.  Second, as  Mr  Melvin  points
    out in his e mail, the information sought was at the direction of  this
    Tribunal.  That did not require the evidence to come in any  particular
    form.  The evidence about what is available in Lithuania  is  necessary
    for the Tribunal to form a view about what the situation would  be  for
    the Appellant if deported, as the Court of Appeal made clear.

58.   Turning then to the evidence produced  on  behalf  of  the  Appellant,
    that is in the form of an expert report of Ms J Poskeviciute.   She  is
    the Director of Administration and Seminar Coordinator of  the  "I  Can
    Live" Coalition based in Vilnius.   That  is  said  to  be  a  "leading
    advocacy group of NGOs and experts working on drug  policy,  access  to
    services  and  rights  of   vulnerable   populations   such   as   drug
    users....inmates and recently released  from  detention  places".   The
    Coalition is said to have "more than 10 years of advocacy experience in
    analysing and influencing national regulations in drug policy,  working
    with all levels of decision makers,  professionals,  media  and  public
    opinion  leaders  in  advocating  for  effective  state   drug   policy
    approaches."

59.   Ms Poskeviciute was asked to comment  on  a  number  of  issues.   She
    points out that drug  dependence  diagnostics  and  treatment  are  the
    function and responsibility of licensed  psychiatrists.   Psychiatrists
    specialising in  dependence  treatment  are  employed  in  five  public
    regional  centres  for  addictive  disorders  (which  chimes  with  the
    Respondent's evidence about the Vilnius centre).   Mental  health  care
    services are said to be "readily available in the primary level  mental
    health  care  centres  in  every  municipality  and  in  mental  health
    hospitals or mental  health  units  of  certain  hospitals  in  several
    cities" (although not the Appellant's home  area).   If  a  person  has
    mandatory health insurance, the services are funded by  the  State  and
    although mental health care can be funded by  the  State  without  that
    insurance, Ms Poskeviciute says that this is  usually  medication-based
    only other than in exceptional circumstances.

60.   Ms Poskeviciute provides a  list  of  requirements  for  state  health
    insurance.  If the Appellant were not  employed  or  self-employed,  it
    appears from her  evidence  that  the  Appellant  could  access  health
    insurance if he were registered unemployed, diagnosed as  dependent  on
    drugs and/or based on his previous national service in Afghanistan.

61.   Ms Poskeviciute's  evidence  confirms  that  the  Vilnius  Centre  for
    Addictive Disorders provides "the full range of psycho-social  services
    that constitute a part of the  methadone  treatment",  the  quality  of
    treatment in the other centres being "rather poor".  Unfortunately, the
    Appellant's  solicitor  has  focussed  in   the   questioning   of   Ms
    Poskeviciute on the availability of treatment in the  Appellant's  home
    area, based on an assumption that this is the place to which  he  would
    return.  However, as already noted, the Appellant's evidence is that he
    would not return to his family as he is either estranged from  them  or
    they would be unable to assist him.  It is not entirely  clear  in  any
    event whether the relatives  from  whom  he  is  not  estranged  -  his
    maternal cousins - still live in his home area.

62.   If one removes from Ms Poskeviciute's evidence  the  assumption  about
    the place of return, which could easily  be  Vilnius,  the  only  other
    barrier seems to be that there is a waiting  list  for  access  to  the
    methadone programme in all the regional centres which  would  mean  the
    Appellant discontinuing his treatment and having a period of abstinence
    before regaining access to methadone.   In this regard, Ms Poskeviciute
    says that "it would be unrealistic to expect a faster admittance  to  a
    methadone program than within one month, given that the appellant would
    need to obtain health insurance before he could join the  waiting  list
    at the clinic."

63.   It is that evidence  which  has  prompted  further  evidence  from  Ms
    Hibbert  who  in  her  letter  dated  11  October  2017  canvasses  the
    suggestion that the Appellant could be given a supply of  methadone  to
    tide him over that period.  I can  readily  accept  her  evidence  that
    there would be risks to simply giving the Appellant himself one month's
    supply of methadone given his drug  dependency  history  and  also  his
    previous suicide attempts (and particularly at a time when he would  be
    about to be deported against  his  will  to  Lithuania).   I  discussed
    however with Ms Cohen why it had apparently not been considered whether
    an arrangement could be reached with a pharmacy in  Lithuania  or  even
    the charity CARITAS or one of the regional health centres to supply the
    Appellant with regular prescriptions over the period of one month until
    the Appellant could access the programme.  Although I accept Ms Cohen's
    response that there is no evidence that this could be  done,  I  cannot
    accept that this does not mean that it could not be.

64.   I do not need to  go  through  the  detail  of  the  remainder  of  Ms
    Poskeviciute's report.  She accepts that  the  services  which  she  is
    asked about do exist in Lithuania  but  there  is  a  charge  or  other
    requirements.  She also accepts that in  principle  the  Appellant  can
    access benefits if the  Appellant  registers  as  unemployed  and  that
    housing is available in temporary municipal shelters.  The benefits are
    only available for a limited time and lack of a residential address may
    cause problems in accessing those benefits.  The amount of benefits  is
    also low (102-114 Euros per month). I note however that  the  Appellant
    is living on a very limited amount of money in the UK.

65.    Helpfully,  Ms  Poskeviciute  accepts  in  her  more  recent  letter,
    following Ms Cizauskaite's e mail, that her evidence is consistent with
    that of Ms  Cizauskaite  so  far  as  the  first  three  questions  are
    concerned (that is to say that the Appellant would be  able  to  access
    methadone treatment, healthcare and social benefits).  Ms  Poskeviciute
    has contacted Ms Cizauskaite following sight of the latter's e mail and
    summarises her discussions in response to the remaining questions.   In
    relation to question [4] concerning accommodation where Ms  Cizauskaite
    says  that  CARITAS   would   provide   temporary   accommodation,   Ms
    Poskeviciute says this:-

         "...she has informed me that Caritas is able to  provide  temporary
         housing  services.   However,  their  services  are   oriented   to
         preparing people for employment and are not really geared to people
         whose ability to work is affected by disability or health  problems
         so they would have to assess whether an individual was suitable for
         this.  The Caritas temporary  accommodation  is  different  to  the
         municipal overnight shelters which  I  referred  to  in  paragraphs
         25(c) and 26(d) of my  report.   However,  the  requirement  for  a
         'clean' TB certificate would also apply  in  order  to  access  the
         Caritas accommodation, as this requirement is set out  in  the  law
         which regulates temporary shelters."

66.   I am mystified by the reference  to  TB.   I  have  read  the  medical
    reports carefully as well as the Appellant's statements.   I  can  find
    absolutely  no  reference  to  the  Appellant  ever  having  contracted
    tuberculosis so I cannot understand why  Ms  Poskeviciute  would  think
    this a barrier.  There is also a heavy assumption in what she says that
    the Appellant is prevented from working by his medical conditions.  Yet
    that runs contrary to the Appellant's own evidence that he  is  working
    five or seven days  per  week  presently  selling  the  Big  Issue.   I
    recognise that this may not be a "nine to five" job but,  although  the
    Appellant has health conditions  and  is  not  assisted  in  employment
    prospects by his drug dependency, I understood  the  Appellant  to  say
    that he would like to  work.  I  also  note  that  Ms  Cizauskaite  was
    informed in the  questions  posed  by  Mr  Melvin's  e  mail  that  the
    Appellant is on a methadone programme and it must  therefore  be  clear
    that the Appellant is a recovering drug addict.   I  do  not  therefore
    consider that what Ms  Poskeviciute  says  in  any  way  undermines  Ms
    Cizauskaite's evidence that temporary accommodation could  be  arranged
    by CARITAS.  This is in addition to the possibility of accommodation in
    temporary shelters noted in Ms Poskeviciute's report.

67.    In  relation  to  question  [5]   asked   of   Ms   Cizauskaite,   Ms
    Poskeviciute's letter continues as follows:-

         "... I also asked Ms Cizauskaite to  confirm  what  assistance  the
         Lithuanian Labour Exchange and Caritas would be able to provide  in
         helping  Mr  Dumbliauskas  to  find  a  job.   Ms  Cizauskaite  has
         confirmed that the assistance that they provide is oriented towards
         people who are capable of fully independent living and if a  person
         is officially determined as only having a partial ability  to  work
         (defined as a percentage of a working day that they are capable  to
         work) or he/she does not have a formal disability, but (as is often
         the case for people with a drug dependency) he/she has difficulties
         working full time or keeping regular hours, this would be seen as a
         barrier to the ability of Caritas and the Labour Exchange  to  help
         the person."

68.    Again,  these  comments  make  a  number  of  assumptions  about  the
    Appellant which are not borne out on the evidence and/or Ms Cizauskaite
    was made aware of the Appellant's  position  by  the  questions  posed.
    True it is that the  Appellant  is  in  receipt  of  disability  living
    allowance but that is at the lowest level and I have not been shown any
    assessment which suggests that the Appellant cannot work full-time.   I
    recognise that selling the Big Issue is not a  full-time  job  but  the
    Appellant's own evidence is that he sells  the  magazine  regularly  on
    most days of the week.  Similarly, although it is certainly  true  that
    the Appellant has lived with friends for the period since  his  release
    from detention, that is no doubt by reason of  financial  circumstances
    as much as anything else.  I note Mr Cordwell's  remarks  in  his  more
    recent letter that the Appellant's current living circumstances provide
    him with his own room  which  "affords  him  more  personal  space  and
    privacy".

69.   I do not understand the medical evidence  to  be  that  the  Appellant
    could not live alone if circumstances required or permitted.  There  is
    no evidence that the friends with whom the Appellant lives have to care
    for him.  Indeed, it is  his  evidence  that  those  friends  are  both
    disabled and no doubt have their own care to consider.

70.   I do not therefore read the evidence as suggesting that the  Appellant
    is not capable of "fully independent living" or  could  not  work  full
    time or regular hours if the opportunity to  do  so  presented  itself.
    For those reasons, I  can  give  little  weight  to  Ms  Poskeviciute's
    evidence on the point whether CARITAS and  the  Lithuanian  authorities
    would assist the Appellant to find work.   I  prefer  Ms  Cizauskaite's
    evidence that they would, provided the Appellant is motivated  to  seek
    it. Based on the oral evidence which I heard from the Appellant, I have
    no reason to think that he would lack that motivation.

71.   Having set out the evidence before me,  I  set  out  below  the  legal
    provisions and case-law  which  applies  before  turning  to  reach  my
    decision on the legal issues which arise for consideration.

RELEVANT LAW

72.    I  start  by  considering  the  relevant  provisions   of   the   EEA
    Regulations.  Before I do so, it is necessary to confirm which  version
    of the EEA Regulations apply.  Although Ms  Cohen's  skeleton  argument
    refers to those regulations as amended  by  the  Immigration  (European
    Economic Area) Regulations 2016 ("the 2016 Regulations"), she  accepted
    in discussion at the hearing that those might  not  be  the  applicable
    version.  She was right to do so.   The  transitional  arrangements  in
    relation to the 2016  Regulations  provide  that  those  apply  to  all
    decisions made after the coming into force of those regulations  (on  1
    February 2017).   However, the EEA Regulations (2006) are preserved for
    the purposes of appeals which are pending as at the coming  into  force
    of the 2016 Regulations by paragraph 3 of Schedule 4 to the Immigration
    (European Economic Area) (Amendment) Regulations 2017

         "3.      Appeals

         (1)      Notwithstanding the revocation of the 2006 Regulations  by
         paragraph 1(1), those Regulations  continue to apply-

             (a) in respect of an appeal under those Regulations against an
             EEA  decision  which  is  pending  (within  the   meaning   of
             regulation 25(2) of the  2006  Regulations)  on  31st  January
             2017;

             (b) in a case where a person has,  on  31st  January  2017,  a
             right  under  those  Regulations  to  appeal  against  an  EEA
             decision.

         (2)      For the purposes of this paragraph, "EEA decision" has the
         meaning given in regulation 2  of  the  2006  Regulations  and  the
         definition of "EEA decision" in regulation 2 of  these  Regulations
         does not apply"

    The background to those changes is set  out  in  TM  (EEA  nationals  -
    meaning; NI practitioners) Zimbabwe [2017] UKUT 165 (IAC) and I do  not
    therefore need to deal with this point in any more detail.

73.   I can also deal very shortly with  the  level  of  protection  against
    deportation which applies in  this  case.   It  is  accepted  that  the
    Appellant cannot show that  he  is  permanently  resident  in  the  UK.
    Although he has been in the UK now for over nineteen years, he has  not
    been exercising Treaty rights for  most  of  that  period.    Ms  Cohen
    accepted that, although the Appellant  is  currently  selling  the  Big
    Issue, which she says amounts to  employment  for  these  purposes,  he
    cannot show that he has resided in the UK for a  continuous  period  of
    five years  in  accordance  with  the  2006  Regulations.   He  is  not
    therefore entitled to the protection of Regulation  21(3)  of  the  EEA
    Regulations.

74.    The  argument  pursued  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  that   the
    Appellant had integrated prior to his imprisonment in 2010 and that  he
    was therefore entitled to benefit from regulation 21(4)(a) of  the  EEA
    Regulations was  rejected  by  the  Tribunal  on  the  basis  that  the
    Appellant is not integrated in the UK.  That argument is  not  repeated
    before me.  There was no cross-appeal by the Appellant in  relation  to
    that finding and nor was it said in the Rule 24 reply  that  there  was
    any error in that regard.  I therefore need  say  no  more  about  this
    point.

75.   The issue which arises for  determination  is  therefore  whether  the
    decision to deport the Appellant meets the requirements  of  Regulation
    21(1), (5) and (6) of the EEA Regulations.  Regulation 21  is  set  out
    below, so far as relevant, for ease of reference:-

         "21(1)   In this regulation a  "relevant  decision"  means  an  EEA
         decision taken on the grounds of public policy, public security  or
         public health.

         ...

         (5)      Where a relevant decision is taken on  grounds  of  public
         policy or public security it shall, in addition to  complying  with
         the preceding paragraphs of this regulation, be taken in accordance
         with the following principles-

             (a)  the  decision  must  comply   with   the   principle   of
             proportionality;

             (b) the decision must be based  exclusively  on  the  personal
             conduct of the person concerned;

             (c)  the  personal  conduct  of  the  person  concerned   must
             represent a genuine, present and sufficiently  serious  threat
             affecting one of the fundamental interests of society;

             (d) matters isolated from the particulars of the case or which
             relate to considerations of general prevention do not  justify
             the decision;

             (e)  a  person's  previous  criminal  convictions  do  not  in
             themselves justify the decision.

         (6)      Before taking a relevant decision on the grounds of public
         policy or public security in relation to a person who  is  resident
         in the United Kingdom the  decision  maker  must  take  account  of
         considerations such  as  the  age,  state  of  health,  family  and
         economic situation of the person, the person's length of  residence
         in the United Kingdom, the person's social and cultural integration
         into the United Kingdom and the extent of the person's  links  with
         his country of origin."

76.   Ms Cohen  raised  in  her  skeleton  argument  an  issue  whether  the
    Appellant's most recent conviction (for the index offence) is spent  by
    reference to the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act  1974.   She  accepted
    however that it could not be  and  abandoned  this  submission  at  the
    hearing.  I do not therefore need to deal with this issue.

77.   Ms Cohen  referred  me  in  particular  to  the  case  of  Essa  (EEA:
    rehabilitation/integration)  [2013]  UKUT  316  at  [32]  and  [33]  as
    follows:-

         "[32]    We observe that for any deportation of an EEA national  or
         family member of such national  to  be  justified  on  public  good
         grounds (irrespective  of  whether  permanent  residence  has  been
         achieved) the claimant must represent a present  threat  to  public
         policy.  The fact of a criminal conviction is not  enough.   It  is
         not permissible in an EEA case to deport a claimant on the basis of
         criminal offending simply to deter others.  This tends to mean,  in
         case of criminal conduct short of the most serious threats  to  the
         public safety of the state, that a candidate  for  EEA  deportation
         must represent a present threat by reason of a  propensity  to  re-
         offend or an unacceptably high risk of  re-offending.   In  such  a
         case, if  there  is  acceptable  evidence  of  rehabilitation,  the
         prospects of future rehabilitation do not enter the  balance,  save
         possibly  as  future  protective  factors  to   ensure   that   the
         rehabilitation remains durable.

         [33]     It is only where rehabilitation is incomplete or uncertain
         that future prospects may play a role  in  the  overall  assessment
         ..."

78.   Reference is also made  to  Vasconcelos  (risk-rehabilitation)  [2013]
    UKUT 00378 (IAC) as follows:-

         "[3]     For those who at the time of determination are or remain a
         present threat to public policy but where the factors  relevant  to
         integration  suggest  that  there  are  reasonable   prospects   of
         rehabilitation, those  prospects  can  be  a  substantial  relevant
         factor in the proportionality balance as to whether deportation  is
         justified.  If the claimant cannot constitute a present threat when
         rehabilitated, and is well-advanced in  rehabilitation  in  a  host
         state where there is a substantial degree of  integration,  it  may
         well very well be disproportionate to proceed to deportation.

         [4]      At the other end of the scale, if there are no  reasonable
         prospects of rehabilitation, the claimant is a present  threat  and
         is likely to remain so for the indefinite future, it cannot be seen
         how  in  the  prospects  of  rehabilitation  could   constitute   a
         significant factor in the  balance.   Thus,  recidivist  offenders,
         career criminals, adult offenders who have failed  to  engage  with
         treatment programmes, claimants with propensity to commit sexual or
         violent offences and the like may well fall into this category."

79.   Finally, in relation to rehabilitation, Ms Cohen  draws  my  attention
    to MC (Essa principles recast) Portugal  [2015]  UKUT  00520  (IAC)  at
    [29]:-

         "...

         (d)      Rehabilitation is not an issue to be  addressed  in  every
         EEA deportation or removal decision taken under regulation  21;  it
         will not be relevant, for example, if  rehabilitation  has  already
         been completed (Essa (2013) at [32]-[33]).

         (e)       Reference  to  prospects   of   rehabilitation   concerns
         reasonable prospects of a person  ceasing  to  commit  crime  (Essa
         (2013) at [35]), not the mere possibility of rehabilitation."

80.   Article 8 ECHR was also faintly canvassed in the Appellant's  skeleton
    argument.  This was not dealt with in oral submissions  in  any  detail
    and, in my view, rightly so.   As  I  discussed  with  Ms  Cohen,  this
    appears to me to be something  of  a  makeweight  submission.   If  the
    Appellant does not succeed in his appeal under the EEA  Regulations  it
    will be on the basis that he is a  genuine,  present  and  sufficiently
    serious threat and that his deportation is  proportionate  applying  EU
    law.   The  criteria  which  apply  to  determination   of   risk   and
    proportionality of deportation are if anything more favourable  to  the
    Appellant under EU law.  It is inconceivable  that,  having  regard  to
    Section 117C Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 as I would be
    bound to do, I could reach a different conclusion  applying  Article  8
    ECHR if I were to find that the Appellant can be deported under the EEA
    Regulations.  I need say no more about this submission in any event  in
    light of my conclusions below.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

Genuine, Present and Sufficiently Serious Threat

81.   I  begin  by  setting  out  the  Respondent's  conclusions  about  the
    Appellant's risk of reoffending in her letter  dated  19  May  2012  as
    follows:-

         "[37]    In completing your NOMS 1 assessment the offender  manager
         found that you posed a low risk of re-offending.  In reaching  this
         conclusion your offender manager has taken into consideration those
         factors which  originally  led  to  your  offending  behaviour  and
         whether those same factors continue to exist.  However, the overall
         score given on your report is in conflict with the written comments
         of the offender manager, in particular the  following  issues  have
         been highlighted within the NOMS 1 report.

         [38]     Your offender manager  has  stated  that  your  crime  was
         financially motivated and at the time you were under the  influence
         of drugs and alcohol.  You have admitted that your drug misuse  has
         had a considerable effect on your financial situation  which  could
         result  in  you  re-offending  and  this  is  borne  out   by   the
         considerable number of offences that you have committed since 2000,
         mainly for theft, all fuelled  by  the  need  to  obtain  money  to
         finance your substance abuse.

         [39]     It was  noted  by  the  sentencing  Judge  when  you  were
         convicted at Snaresbrook Crown Court on 8 June 2010 that since 2000
         you had committed numerous offences related to your abuse of drugs,
         originally to  you  holding  weaponry,  but  generally  related  to
         dishonesty and stealing and that your last offence  was  considered
         to be a considerable step up in its severity fuelled by the need to
         obtain money to finance  your  alcohol  and  drug  habits.   It  is
         unacceptable to leave  the  public  vulnerable  to  the  disturbing
         escalation in your criminal behaviour and pattern  of  re-offending
         whilst on bail.

         [40]     You have clearly been afforded many opportunities  by  the
         courts to address your health issues and have in the past relapsed.
          Although you are currently receiving drug therapy in prison in the
         form of daily methadone, there is no evidence that you  have  tried
         to identify the issues surrounding your substance abuse which would
         assist you in breaking the cycle of your addiction which inevitably
         results in your pattern of re-offending.  Taking these factors into
         consideration it has been concluded that you present a high risk of
         re-offending and subsequent harm to the public."

82.   The NOMS assessments in this  case  are  now  somewhat  out  of  date,
    having been completed on 1-8 May 2012.  They also relate  to  a  period
    when the Appellant was and had been for some time in detention.  I  was
    not taken to them by either representative.  It is for that reason that
    I do not find it necessary to set out those assessments.  It is however
    useful to set out the First-tier  Tribunal's  record  of  the  evidence
    which it had as to risk and its findings in that  regard.   Although  I
    have set aside that decision, the Tribunal's  findings  on  this  issue
    were not the subject of challenge by either party in this Tribunal  and
    they provide a useful synopsis of the evidence as existed on this topic
    at that time (in 2013 - when the Appellant remained in detention):-

         "[121]   There are a  number  of  difficult  factors  in  assessing
         whether the personal conduct of the appellant represents a genuine,
         present and  sufficiently  serious  threat  affecting  one  of  the
         fundamental interests of society.  We note in accordance with  High
         Court authority that a threat must be a present  threat.   In  this
         regard we have to give careful assessment to the likelihood of  the
         appellant committing further offences.  We have previously  in  our
         determination   summarised   the   attitude   of   the   consultant
         psychiatrist  in  this  regard.   We  have  also  referred  to  the
         observations made in the respondent's refusal letter.  The  refusal
         letter indicated that the appellant  was  subject  to  the  minimum
         level of Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements  and  that  in
         the risk  assessment  the  offender  manager  had  found  that  the
         appellant posed a medium risk of harm to the public.  It  was  also
         noted that in the NOMS1 assessment, the offender manager had  found
         that the appellant posed a low risk of reoffending.  The  objective
         report of the consultant  psychiatrist  referred  to  the  risk  of
         reoffending in the next year if returned to the community in the UK
         and medium and the risk of serious offending as low.

         [122]    The essential factor in all these assessments  relates  to
         whether the appellant would relapse into his heroin addiction.   It
         is clear from documentation as a whole that if  the  appellant  did
         not relapse and attended all the assistance programmes specified in
         the Probation Officer's letter of 27 December 2012 - that the  risk
         of reoffending would be very substantially reduced.  We have  found
         that the appellant is genuine and credible in his assertion that he
         has successfully abstained from drug and alcohol use for the  three
         years he  has  been  in  custody.   We  have  carefully  noted  the
         consultant psychiatrist's observation that this is in a  controlled
         environment - it is nevertheless an aspect which had previously not
         been achieved by the appellant.   The  courses  the  appellant  has
         undertaken in prison would be of substantial assistance in  helping
         him to avoid relapsing - as would the support  programmes  referred
         to  in  the  Probation  Officer's  report.   As  against  that  the
         appellant  has  committed  a  substantial  number  (some  fourteen)
         offences in the period 2000-2010.  It is not disputed that all this
         criminal  conduct  related  to  the  appellant  fuelling  his  drug
         dependence.  The history of the  offending  prior  to  the  robbery
         offence although not minor could not be described  as  particularly
         serious from the nature of the sentences  imposed.   The  appellant
         had not spent more than three months in prison in respect of any of
         the previous offences - prior to the  robbery  conviction.   It  is
         common cause that as stated by the sentencing Judge the appellant's
         robbery offence marked a very substantial step up in the nature  of
         his criminal offending.  We are satisfied  that  the  appellant  is
         genuinely remorseful for this offence - which was committed to fuel
         his drug addiction.  We would also note that although the  60  year
         old victim was subjected to a frightening  experience  which  would
         have caused considerable mental anguish  -  no  physical  harm  was
         suffered.  The appellant  also,  as  described  by  the  sentencing
         Judge, on discovering he could not leave the premises  without  the
         assistance of the victim, allowed her  to  also  leave  -  and  she
         immediately raised the alarm, resulting in the  appellant's  arrest
         at the scene.

         [123]    The line to be drawn  in  assessing  the  requirements  of
         Regulation 21(5)(c) is a difficult one.  The  personal  conduct  of
         the appellant has certainly represented a genuine and  sufficiently
         serious threat  affecting  one  of  the  fundamental  interests  of
         society in the past.  The appellant's conduct  would  constitute  a
         present threat - unless  he  were  able  to  properly  rehabilitate
         himself and not relapse into drug addiction.  Whether the appellant
         does that depends on his future conduct.   The  appellant  has  the
         advantage of having been drug and  alcohol  free  for  three  years
         whilst in custody.  He has the advantage of what we  have  assessed
         is a genuine determination to avoid relapsing - to  concentrate  on
         rebuilding his health in view of the serious health problems he  is
         facing and of building a relationship with  his  son  and  grandson
         (who was  born  in  December  2012).   Everything  depends  on  the
         appellant's ability to fulfil his hopes and  not  to  relapse.   It
         cannot, however, be stated that the  appellant's  personal  conduct
         does not represent a present threat.  The threat is present because
         it is a hope for the future that the  appellant  will  not  relapse
         into his previous conduct.  We reiterate our finding of the genuine
         nature of the appellant's determination - but  it  will  depend  on
         future conduct."

83.   Of course, that assessment and the observations there made are  in  no
    way binding on me.  Indeed, I have set aside that decision and as  such
    it is for me to assess afresh the  question  of  the  risk  which  this
    Appellant poses.  They are though useful as  a  statement  of  what  is
    really the central focus of that risk and that is the Appellant's  drug
    dependency and his offending to finance that dependency.  At  the  time
    of the  First-tier  Tribunal's  decision,  the  Appellant  remained  in
    detention and so that Tribunal  could  not  know  what  the  impact  of
    release would be. I have the benefit of seeing how  the  Appellant  has
    adjusted to his liberty and the extent to which his risk has reduced as
    a result of his behaviour throughout that period. I do of  course  also
    take into account that, throughout the period since  his  release,  the
    Appellant has  been  subject  to  deportation  action  which  may  have
    provided him with an added incentive not to resort to  drug  abuse  and
    not to offend.

84.   On the one  hand,  it  is  to  the  Appellant's  credit  that  he  has
    continued to engage with  drug  recovery  services,  has  undertaken  a
    methadone programme and now takes a dosage of methadone to control  his
    drug dependency which is assessed by the professionals to be  low.    I
    cannot though ignore on  the  other  hand  the  two  lapses  which  the
    Appellant has  suffered.   I  say  lapses  advisedly  because,  as  the
    Appellant himself  pointed  out,  there  is  a  difference  between  an
    occasional lapse which may involve taking substances for a  very  short
    period of a few days and a  full-blown  relapse  which  leads  back  to
    regular substance abuse.  That is not what has happened in the case  of
    this Appellant.

85.   The two lapses, whilst very unfortunate and  not  to  the  Appellant's
    credit, were triggered by the death of his mother and his close  friend
    in a very short space of time and then in the  following  year  at  the
    same time, in part due to the anniversary of their deaths and  in  part
    because the Appellant  was  in  pain  due  to  his  arthritis.   It  is
    understandable given the Appellant's mental health  problems  that  the
    deaths of a close friend and his mother in close succession might  have
    a significant impact on him.  As I say, though, it is not in his favour
    that he again resorted to hard drug use to cope.  I  also  note  though
    that the Appellant has had to cope with other events which  would  have
    been difficult for him, such as when the Court  of  Appeal  effectively
    overturned the allowing of his appeal.  He has also had to move between
    accommodation which would have been unsettling for him.   It  is  worth
    noting that, when those difficulties have arisen, the Appellant has not
    returned to drug use.

86.   There is one additional observation which I need  to  make  about  the
    two lapses. Although the  Appellant  lapsed,  he  did  not  commit  any
    offences.  I accept Mr Melvin's submission that the Appellant's use  of
    Class A drugs is in itself a criminal offence (as the Appellant himself
    accepted in evidence) but that cannot be said to be  an  offence  which
    causes risk to the  public  unless  the  Appellant  does  something  in
    consequence of the taking of those drugs which impacts on  others.   He
    did not do so on either occasion.

87.   Mr  Cordwell  in  his  report  makes  the  point  that,  although  the
    Appellant was assessed in 2012 as a medium risk, that risk  is  lowered
    if the Appellant does not use  substances,  continues  to  engage  with
    support services and engages in  meaningful  activities.   Mr  Cordwell
    makes clear that the risk associated with drug use is  one  of  relapse
    into frequent or persistent use rather than  a  very  small  number  of
    short lapses.

88.   When asked why he would not relapse into persistent drug  use  in  the
    future, the Appellant said that he now has  a  very  good  relationship
    with his key worker, Ms Hibbert, and that, if he "is in a  bad  place",
    he can speak with her.  I cannot ignore though that Ms Hibbert has been
    his key worker since 2014 and the Appellant's ability to speak with her
    did not prevent the lapses in December 2015 or December  2016.   It  is
    the case though that the Appellant has continued  to  engage  with  the
    drug  recovery  service  throughout  the  period  since  he  has   left
    detention.  Ms Hibbert notes that he meets with her regularly.  He  has
    also continued successfully  to  pursue  a  methadone  programme.   His
    dosage has reduced (or will shortly reduce) to what is assessed  to  be
    low.

89.   In terms of other positive or negative factors which  might  influence
    risk, one of the positive factors noted by the First-tier Tribunal  was
    the possibility of the Appellant building a relationship with  his  son
    and grandson.  That has not  materialised  and  the  Appellant  is  now
    estranged from both his children.  On the positive  side,  though,  the
    Appellant has a number of friends in the UK who have been  prepared  to
    come to his assistance by providing him with accommodation.  Mr  Melvin
    asked the Appellant why  those  persons  had  not  written  letters  of
    support for him or come to provide testimony at  the  hearing.   It  is
    true that there is no such evidence.  However, the  way  in  which  the
    case is presented is largely a matter for  the  Appellant's  solicitors
    and I do not draw any adverse  inferences  from  the  fact  that  these
    friends have not provided statements or oral testimony.  The fact which
    is not disputed is that various friends  have  provided  the  Appellant
    with help since he left detention and that he has friends therefore who
    have been willing to support him.

90.   Mr Cordwell also points as a risk reducing factor to the need for  the
    Appellant to find a meaningful and rewarding use of his time.  In  this
    connection, I was impressed  by  the  Appellant's  evidence  about  the
    contribution which he feels his  work  for  Big  Issue  is  having.   I
    recognise that he has only been selling  the  magazine  since  December
    2016 following a period of absence, however long that period.  However,
    it was clear from his oral evidence that the Appellant is proud of  his
    own endeavour and of the contribution which he feels he  is  making  to
    the community as well as the  social  engagement  which  this  work  is
    enabling him to form.  I was impressed by that evidence.

91.   As the Court of Appeal recognised in its judgment in  this  case,  the
    passage of time since release and the Appellant's behaviour during that
    period are important factors in the assessment of the  risk  which  the
    Appellant poses.  That risk,  as  I  have  said,  is  not  whether  the
    Appellant continues to take  drugs  on  isolated  occasions  or  indeed
    whether he is completely cured of his drug addiction (which he  clearly
    is not since he remains on a methadone programme).  The  issue  is  the
    risk which he poses to the public and not to himself.

92.   Whilst as the preceding paragraphs make clear, assessment of the  risk
    which the Appellant now poses is finely balanced, I am  satisfied  that
    he is not a present risk. Although as I have said, it  is  not  to  the
    Appellant's credit that there have been two lapses  into  drug  taking,
    they were triggered by an emotional response to particularly  difficult
    circumstances.  What is to the Appellant's credit is  that  on  neither
    occasion has he committed an offence or at  least  not  one  which  has
    posed a danger to anyone but himself. He has not lapsed at other  times
    when  he  has  faced  difficulties.   In  that  regard,  the  Appellant
    presented as a truthful witness.  He did not try to hide  these  lapses
    and I am therefore satisfied that, when he  gave  evidence  that  these
    were the only two lapses he was telling the truth.

93.   The Appellant has also been motivated to  find  employment  albeit  he
    has only recently resumed that employment.  The need to find employment
    and a meaningful existence were two of the factors  which  Mr  Cordwell
    noted as capable of reducing the risk posed by the Appellant.  That the
    Appellant finds his employment rewarding was evident from  the  way  he
    spoke about it and the contribution which he considers he is  now  able
    to make to the community.

94.   I recognise that low risk does not mean no risk but the issue  for  me
    is whether the risk is both present and sufficiently serious.  Based on
    the evidence, in particular that of Mr Cordwell and the Appellant's own
    evidence, including in particular his evidence given orally and for the
    reasons given above, I am satisfied that the Appellant no longer  poses
    a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat.  The Appellant will
    no doubt be aware though that, if he were to reoffend whether  to  fund
    his drug use or otherwise, the  consequences  for  him  could  be  very
    serious.

Proportionality

95.   Since I have found that the Appellant does not  satisfy  the  criteria
    for deportation due to the lack of a present threat posed by him, it is
    not strictly necessary for me to say  anything  about  proportionality.
    However, since this was the reason that the Court of Appeal found there
    to be an error of law, marked also by my  setting  aside  the  previous
    First-tier Tribunal decision and  since  I  have  been  presented  with
    evidence which the previous Court/Tribunals did not have when making an
    assessment about proportionality, I make some observations  about  this
    aspect.

96.   Regulation 21(6) of the  EEA  Regulations  requires  the  taking  into
    account of the Appellant's age, state of health,  family  and  economic
    situation, his length of residence in the UK, his social  and  cultural
    integration into the UK and the extent of his links with Lithuania.

97.   The Appellant has been in the UK for just under twenty years.  He  had
    leave only for the first six  months  but  of  course  since  Lithuania
    acceded to the European Union in 2004, he has not required  leave.   He
    claimed asylum but that claim was not pursued on appeal.  The Appellant
    was aged thirty-two when he came to the UK.  He is now  aged  fifty-two
    years.  He grew up in Lithuania, was  educated  there  and  has  worked
    there.

98.   By contrast, since coming to the UK, the  Appellant  has  worked  only
    intermittently.  Although as I indicate above, I was impressed  by  the
    Appellant's evidence about the contribution which he is now  making  to
    society in the UK and that is something which it is to be hoped he will
    develop moving forward, there is no doubt that his past history shows a
    detrimental impact on society here rather than a positive contribution.



99.   It cannot be said either that the Appellant has forged strong ties  in
    the UK.  He has formed one relationship with a  partner  but  that  has
    broken down.  He has friends but, as Mr Melvin observed, those  friends
    have not provided statements in support his case or  attended  to  give
    oral evidence.  Whilst, therefore, as I have found, their support is  a
    positive factor in terms of  reducing  the  risk  which  the  Appellant
    poses, there is little evidence of the Appellant becoming socially  and
    culturally integrated.

100.  The Appellant has few ties in Lithuania.  He has a daughter there  but
    is estranged from her.  His  mother  has  died.   He  has  some  family
    members from whom he is not estranged and, even though the evidence  is
    that they would not be able to support him  financially,  there  is  no
    suggestion that they could not emotionally support him if  he  were  to
    return to Lithuania.  Equally, in any event, he has few if any ties  in
    the UK.  He has a son here who has a family including  the  Appellant's
    grandchild.  However, the Appellant's evidence is that he has also lost
    contact with his son.  There is no  evidence  about  friends  that  the
    Appellant may still have in Lithuania.  His  evidence  about  his  past
    history is that such close friends as he once had have either  died  or
    moved away.  As I say, though, there is limited evidence about  friends
    in the UK either.

101.  There can be no doubt that  the  Appellant  has  health  issues,  most
    notably mental health issues.  However, the Appellant has not  provided
    evidence that medication to control those issues is  not  available  in
    Lithuania.  Further, he has provided evidence that he was  treated  for
    mental health issues in Lithuania before he came to the UK.

102.  The factor which impressed the previous Tribunals and on  which  their
    positive decision was founded is that treatment  is  not  available  in
    Lithuania (or not to a sufficient extent) to assist the Appellant  with
    his drug dependency  and  that  this  would  adversely  impact  on  his
    prospects   of   rehabilitation   so   as   to    render    deportation
    disproportionate.

103.  I have set out the evidence in  relation  to  treatment  available  in
    Lithuania at [51] to [70] above.  The evidence  comes  from  two  women
    both involved in assisting those  with  drug  dependency.   As  I  have
    explained, however, I was  more  impressed  with  the  evidence  of  Ms
    Cizauskaite for the Respondent.  Ms Cizauskaite  works  for  a  charity
    operating on the ground in Lithuania.  Ms Poskeviciute is a director of
    a leading advocacy group.  As such, I do not assess from  her  evidence
    that she has the same level of daily operational involvement with those
    like the Appellant who are adversely affected by drug dependency.

104.  Further, as Ms  Poskeviciute  herself  points  out,  there  is  little
    disagreement between the evidence  of  the  two  women.   However,  the
    points of distinction which she draws between her evidence and that  of
    Ms Cizauskaite appear to me to be founded on assumptions which are  not
    borne out on the evidence in this case,  such  as  that  the  Appellant
    would return to his home town or that he would be unable to work and so
    would not be assisted by the charity for which Ms Cizauskaite works.

105.  I have also set out at [53] to [56] above,  the  evidence  taken  from
    the websites to which I was referred which show that,  particularly  in
    Vilnius, there is drug recovery treatment available of  much  the  same
    type as the Appellant receives in the UK.

106.  The highpoint of the Appellant's case in this regard is that he  would
    be returned to Lithuania without a supply  of  methadone  and  that  he
    would not be able to  access  that  medication  for  about  four  weeks
    following return.  As a result, it is  said,  his  drug  rehabilitation
    would suffer a major setback.

107.  I intend no offence to Ms Hibbert  who  has  provided  evidence  about
    what could (or more accurately could not)  be  done  to  overcome  this
    problem.  She is a key worker with a drug treatment centre.   She  does
    not profess to have experience of dealing  with  deportation  of  those
    with  drug  dependency  to  other  countries.   However,  the   problem
    identified  by  her  evidence  (in  conjunction   with   that   of   Ms
    Poskeviciute) is not one which could, as a matter of common  sense,  be
    insurmountable.  Contact has been made, via the Respondent's  evidence,
    with a charity operating on the ground in Lithuania.  I see  no  reason
    why contact could not be made  at  an  individual  level  between  that
    charity and the Appellant or those representing him (either  solicitors
    or medics)  to  find  a  solution  such  as  collection  of  a  regular
    prescription from a pharmacy in Lithuania during that period.  It might
    even be possible for the Appellant to sign up with the  authorities  in
    Lithuania to obtain the necessary paperwork to access  healthcare  even
    before he returns and/or to  register  with  one  of  the  health  care
    centres dealing with those with drug dependency issues.

108.  I recognise that this is to a degree speculative and  this  is  not  a
    case where the UK authorities have obtained (or been asked  to  obtain)
    assurances about what could be done in this individual case to  assist.
    The problem does not arise given my conclusion about the risk which the
    Appellant poses since he will not be deported but, had  I  not  reached
    the conclusion which I have, I would not have found deportation  to  be
    disproportionate on this account.

109.  For the reasons set out above, though, I conclude that  the  Appellant
    cannot  be  deported  as  he  does  not  pose  a  genuine,  present  or
    sufficiently serious threat.  For that reason, his appeal  is  allowed.



DECISION

For the reasons given at [11] to [12] above, the decision of the  First-tier
Tribunal (FTTJ Bartlett and Ms Emblin) contains a material error of  law  in
relation to the  allowing  of  the  appeal  under  the  EEA  Regulations.  I
therefore set aside that part of that  decision.   I  re-make  the  decision
allowing the Appellant's appeal under  the  Immigration  (European  Economic
Area) Regulations 2006 on the basis that  the  Appellant  does  not  pose  a
genuine, present and  sufficiently  serious  threat  affecting  one  of  the
fundamental interests of society.
