Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr G Davison, Counsel, instructed by HSBS Law UK
                    Office (Harbans Singh & Balwant Solicitors)
For the Respondent:    Mr D Clarke, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS
                            (extempore judgment)

 1. Pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 we make an order prohibiting the disclosure or publication of  any
    matter likely to lead members of the public to identify the  appellant.
    Breach of this order can be punished as a contempt of  court.  We  make
    this order because this is a protection case and there is invariably  a
    risk in cases of this kind that publicity will itself create a risk and
    because a similar order was made by the First-tier Tribunal and we were
    not asked to make a different order.

 2. This is an  appeal  against  a  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    dismissing the appeal of  the  appellant  against  a  decision  of  the
    Secretary of State refusing her leave to remain  as  a  refugee  or  on
    human rights grounds.

 3. Today the appellant was represented by Mr Davison.  He did  not  appear
    in the First-tier Tribunal, he did not settle the grounds of appeal and
    I anticipate they would not have been drawn in the way they were if  he
    had had responsibility at an earlier stage.

 4. There is no meaningful challenge to the finding that the  appellant  is
    not a refugee or to the finding that the appeal should not  be  allowed
    on human rights grounds except possibly under Article 8 of the European
    Convention on Human Rights.  The core point is that this appellant  has
    suffered significant violence at the hands of her  former  husband  and
    has an expressed fear of further violence in the event of her return to
    India.  Those concerns can be addressed by local  effective  protection
    or, in the alternative, internal relocation to a part  of  India  where
    the alleged reach of her former husband does not extend.  This  is  not
    wishful thinking.  The appellant is an  educated  woman  who  could  be
    expected to establish herself away from her immediate family in  India.
    These points are made perfectly properly in the  Decision  and  Reasons
    and to the extent that there is any appeal against  those  findings  we
    reject the arguments.

 5. The Article 8 point is more nuanced and was picked up by Upper Tribunal
    Judge Bruce when  she  gave  permission.  It  is  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal did not deal satisfactorily with the contention that,  in  the
    event of the appellant  returning  to  India,  she  could  satisfy  the
    requirements of the Rules to enter the United Kingdom as a wife. It was
    arguable that the Tribunal should have asked if in fact  requiring  the
    Appellant to return to India to make an application.  As was  explained
    by the Upper Tribunal in R (on the application of Chen) v Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department) (Appendix FM  -  Chikwamba  -  temporary
    separation - proportionality) IJR [2015] UKUT 189 (IAC), that  argument
    does not get going unless it is a  case  where  the  applicant  clearly
    satisfies the requirements of the Rules

 6. We are satisfied that this is not such a case.  Indeed, there was  some
    uncertainty before us today whether the applicant would be applying  as
    a wife or as a fiancï¿½e.  There has been no clear attempt in the witness
    statement or in the evidence to show compliance with the Rules.  It  is
    not possible to look at the witness statements and supporting financial
    documents and say with any  confidence  that  sufficient  earnings  are
    established or have been established to  a  sufficient  time.   Really,
    there is no attempt on the part of the appellant to show that  she  met
    the requirements of any relevant Rules.  Once that is appreciated  then
    the arguments based on Chen or the decision in Chikwamba v SSHD  [2008]
    UKHL 40 fall away.

 7. The ordinary position is that a person who is in the United Kingdom and
    wishes to  marry  should  leave,  return  to  his  or  her  country  of
    nationality and make an application under the Rules.  As was made plain
    in Chikwamba, mere empty recitation of "it is policy" does not answer a
    human rights argument and a little more thought  is  needed.   That  we
    very much have in mind but this case does not fall in the  category  of
    cases identified in Chikwamba and explained further in Chen because  it
    is not a case where there is clear compliance with any relevant Rule.

 8. It may be that the appellant can satisfy the requirements of the Rules.
     We are certainly not intending to make any ruling that she cannot.  We
    are simply saying that on the material  before  us  the  point  is  not
    established and that is a prerequisite to the argument that depends  on
    Chen and Chikwamba and in the circumstances that ground of appeal  also
    fails and we dismiss this appeal.

    The appeal is dismissed.
