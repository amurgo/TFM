Representation:

For the Appellant:     Miss C Wilson-Brown
For the Respondent:    Ms R Pettersen


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is the appellant's appeal against the decision of Judge  Cox  made
    following a hearing at Bradford on 6th April 2017.

 2. The appellant is a national of Libya  born  on  12th  April  1993.   He
    claimed asylum in the UK on 2nd December 2014  and  was  refused.   His
    appeal against that decision was dismissed by Judge Cox and there is no
    challenge against that decision.  However the appellant argued that  he
    was at risk on return because of general conditions in Libya.

 3. On 23rd August 2017 Designated Judge Woodcraft  granted  permission  on
    the grounds that the Upper Tribunal has, since Judge Cox's decision was
    promulgated, issued country guidance  on  Libya,  namely  ZMM  (Article
    15(c)) Libya CG [2017] UKUT 00263 which demonstrates that  there  is  a
    risk to life contrary to Article 15(c) of the  Qualification  Directive
    anywhere in Libya.

 4. Prior to the hearing Ms Pettersen wrote to the Tribunal inviting me  to
    remake the decision allowing the case under humanitarian protection  in
    line  with  country  guidance  case  law,  but  upholding  the  Refugee
    Convention issue as decided by the FtT Judge.

 5. Miss Wilson-Brown confirmed that she was content  with  Ms  Pettersen's
    proposal.

Notice of Decision

 6. The original judge did not err in law so far as the  asylum  claim  was
    concerned, and  his  decision  stands.   So  far  as  the  humanitarian
    protection claim is concerned, his decision is set aside and remade  as
    follows.  The appeal is  allowed  with  respect  to  the  Qualification
    Directive.

No anonymity direction is made.
