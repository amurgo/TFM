For the Respondent:    Mr P Duffy, of the Specialist Appeals Team


                            DECISION AND REASONS


The Appellant

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Nigeria born on 22 December 1973.   On  9
    February 2005 she entered and  on  26  September  2009  she  married  a
    Portuguese national exercising Treaty rights.  On 7 April 2011 she  was
    issued with a residence  card  in  that  capacity.   The  marriage  was
    dissolved by a Decree Absolute pronounced on 4 November 2013.

 2. On 25 September 2014 the  Appellant  applied  for  permanent  residence
    under the Immigration  (EEA)  Regulations  2006  as  amended  (the  EEA
    Regs.).

The Respondent's Decision

 3. On 19 December 2014 the Respondent refused the Appellant's  application
    for a permanent residence  card  because  she  was  not  satisfied  the
    Appellant had shown that her  ex-husband  had  been  exercising  Treaty
    rights at the date of the Decree Absolute.

The First-tier Tribunal Proceedings

 4. On 12  January  2015  the  Appellant  lodged  notice  of  appeal  under
    Regulation 26 of the EEA Regs.  and  Section  82  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 as amended.   The  grounds  assert  the
    Appellant's ex-husband was exercising Treaty rights as a  self-employed
    person and made a claim under Article 8 of the European Convention.  It
    is to be noted that there was no provision in the  decision  to  remove
    the Appellant.  No notice under Section 120 of the 2002  Act  had  been
    served on the Appellant and consequently in the light of  the  decision
    in Amirtyemour [2015] UKUT 400466 (IAC) there was no reason to consider
    the claim under the European Convention.

 5. By a decision promulgated on 22 November 2015 Judge of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Grimes dismissed the appeal  because  the  Appellant  had  not
    shown that her ex-husband was exercising Treaty rights at the  date  of
    the Decree Absolute.

 6. On 17  February  2016  Designated  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Campbell granted the Appellant permission to appeal because  the  Judge
    had arguably erred  in  law  in  her  treatment  of  the  documentation
    submitted by the Appellant in relation to the claimed finding by her ex-
    husband of a tax return for the year ending 5 April 2014,  particularly
    in the light of the screenshot at page 48  of  the  Appellant's  bundle
    showing a tax calculation and that the return had  been  submitted  for
    the y/e 5 April 2014.

The Upper Tribunal Proceedings

 7. Following a hearing on 29 March 2016 Deputy Judge of the Upper Tribunal
    Storey promulgated a decision setting aside the decision of the  First-
    tier Tribunal and adjourning the hearing of the substantive  appeal  in
    the Upper Tribunal until after the Court of  Justice  of  the  European
    Union had handed down judgment in SSHD v NA (Case C-115/15).   He  also
    gave a direction relating to Section 40 of the UK Borders Act 2007  for
    the Respondent to file at the court the results of enquiries made of HM
    Revenue & Customs about the tax affairs of the Appellant's ex-husband.

 8. The Appellant was present at the hearing but took no active part.  Both
    parties agreed that in the event the judgment  in  NA  (Case  C-115/15)
    contained nothing of relevance to the appeal.

 9. They agreed that the Appellant's ex-husband had not  been  co-operative
    and Ms Mahmud stated he was believed recently to have left  the  United
    Kingdom.  In the event it was agreed the only issue was  whether  there
    was sufficient evidence to show that  the  Appellant's  ex-husband  had
    been exercising Treaty rights under Regulation 6 of the 2006  Regs.  at
    the date of the Decree Absolute.  Both parties accepted it was unlikely
    any further evidence would be forthcoming from him or indeed  from  any
    source over and above the  evidence  which  was  before  the  Tribunal.
    There was an issue whether the tax return for y/e 5 April 2014 had been
    filed.

10. Page 48 of the Appellant's bundle contained a screenshot of an  on-line
    calculation of the tax liability of the Appellant's ex-husband for  the
    y/e 5 April 2014 and included a note that the return had been submitted
    and was '100% complete'.

11. However, the response to the Section 40 UK  Borders  Act  2007  request
    dated 4 August 2016 and the accompanying witness statement from an HMRC
    Officer indicated a tax return for  y/e  5  April  2014  had  not  been
    requested or issued.  It also showed that there was no  record  of  any
    Tax Credits for that year.  The on-line calculation at page 48  of  the
    Appellant's bundle showed income received from self-employment for  the
    tax year was �7,189 and there had been no income from  any  employment.
    On this basis there  was  no  liability  for  income  tax  because  the
    personal allowance for the tax year was �9,440.

Submissions for the Respondent

12. Mr Duffy identified the sole  issue  as  whether  the  Appellant's  ex-
    husband had been exercising Treaty rights at the  date  of  the  Decree
    Absolute.  The response to the Section 40 UK Borders Act  2007  enquiry
    showed there had been no tax return filed for that year and  no  record
    of any payment of tax.  Given the chain  of  custody  of  the  evidence
    represented by the Section 40  response,  the  Respondent  queried  the
    genuineness of the screenshot calculation of tax liability for the year
    ending 5 April 2014.

13. He then turned to the issue whether even if reliance was placed on  the
    screenshot calculation, the ex-husband's earnings of �7,189 constituted
    sufficient to meet the criteria  for  exercising  Treaty  rights.   The
    relevant figures were not before the Tribunal but  he  considered  that
    benefits would have amounted to between �5,500 to �6,000 plus rent  and
    council tax or housing benefit it was unlikely  that  the  ex-husband's
    earnings  placed  him  across  the  relevant  threshold  to  meet   the
    Regulation 6 criteria.  Consequently, the appeal should be dismissed.

Submissions for the Appellant

14. Ms Mahmud submitted that the circumstances disclosed by the  screenshot
    calculation of tax liability for y/e 5 April 2014 showed the ex-husband
    was exercising Treaty rights and met the criteria in Regulation 6.  She
    accepted the negative response to the Section 40 UK  Borders  Act  2007
    request  but  submitted  that  the  screenshot  from  the  ex-husband's
    accountant should be preferred and the appeal allowed.

15. It was agreed the Appellant should have a further period  of  time  not
    exceeding 48 hours in which to submit  a  copy  of  her  husband's  tax
    return for 2013/14 and that if so it might be  supported  with  written
    submissions made at the same time and that  an  opportunity  should  be
    given to the Respondent for a prompt response to such submissions.

16. On that basis I reserved my decision.

17. The Appellant  subsequently  submitted  to  the  Tribunal  and  to  the
    Respondent a copy of the 2014  Tax  Return  for  her  ex-husband  which
    confirmed the figures and information given  at  the  hearing.  Neither
    party has made any submissions on the Return. Noting  the  standard  of
    proof is the civil standard; that is on the  balance  of  probabilities
    and that the burden is on the Appellant, I accept the information given
    about  the  ex-husband's  earnings  for  the  tax  year  in  which  the
    Appellant's Decree Absolute was pronounced and that at that date her ex-
    husband was working.

18. The other  documentation  in  the  Tribunal  file  indicates  that  the
    Appellant's ex-husband made tax returns disclosing  income  from  self-
    employment as follows: -

             y/e 5 April 2010: �6752

             y/e 5 April 2011: �5096

             y/e 5 April 2012: �5744

             y/e 5 April 2013: �6814

             y/e 5 April 2014: �7189

19. The remaining issue is whether the ex-husband's earnings are sufficient
    to show he met the requirements of Reg.4(1)(b) of the EEA Regs. that he
    was a self-employed person in accordance with what was  Article  43  of
    the Treaty establishing the European Community which provides:

         Within the framework of the provisions set out below,  restrictions
         on the freedom of establishment of nationals of a Member  State  in
         the territory of another Member State  shall  be  prohibited.  Such
         prohibition shall also apply to restrictions on the  setting-up  of
         agencies, branches or subsidiaries by nationals of any Member State
         established in the  territory  of  any  Member  State.  Freedom  of
         establishment shall  include  the  right  to  take  up  and  pursue
         activities as self-employed  persons  and  to  set  up  and  manage
         undertakings, in particular companies or firms within  the  meaning
         of the second paragraph of Article 54, under  the  conditions  laid
         down for its own nationals by the law of  the  country  where  such
         establishment is effected, subject to the provisions of the Chapter
         relating to capital.

20. There was no suggestion that the Appellant's ex-husband had had access
    to social security benefits or that as a self-employed person  he  did
    not have comprehensive insurance sickness cover.  In  this  light  and
    having  regard  to  the  Appellant's  evidence  that  her   ex-husband
    struggled with his business which would appear  in  the  end  to  have
    failed and looking at his earnings history, I find that at the date of
    the Decree Absolute he  was  a  self-employed  person  exercising  the
    Treaty right of establishment in the United Kingdom. Consequently  the
    appeal succeeds.

Notice of Decision

The appeal is allowed under EEA Regulations.

TO THE RESPONDENT: FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a fee award and have decided to make no  fee  award
because it was not until  after  the  Respondent's  decision  the  Appellant
supplied the relevant evidence.
