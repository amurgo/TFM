                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appellants

1.   The Appellants are citizens of Pakistan and are husband and wife.   The
    First Appellant was born on 1st January 1951 and the  Second  Appellant
    on 1st January 1954.  They appeal against the decision of Judge of  the
    First-tier Tribunal O'Rourke sitting at Newport on  30th  January  2015
    who dismissed their appeals against decisions of the  Respondent  dated
    11th June 2014.  Those decisions were to refuse to grant the Appellants
    further leave to remain in the United Kingdom on the grounds of private
    and family life.

2.   The Appellants arrived in the United Kingdom on 16th January 2014  with
    leave to enter as family visitors valid until 12th March 2014.  On that
    date they applied for leave to remain on the basis of their private and
    family lives.  The Respondent in  refusing  the  applications  was  not
    satisfied that the Appellants met the requirements of  Appendix  FM  of
    the Immigration Rules as neither were UK citizens  or  settled  in  the
    United Kingdom.  The Respondent also refused the application under  the
    requirements of paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration  Rules  because  it
    was not accepted that there were significant obstacles to the  couple's
    reintegration into Pakistan.  It was conceded at the hearing that  they
    could not meet Section EC-DR of Appendix FM because they were  applying
    in-country and had not made valid applications for entry  clearance  as
    adult dependent relatives.  The  appeals  therefore  proceeded  on  the
    basis  that  the  Respondent's  decisions   breached   this   country's
    obligations under Article 8 (right to respect for  private  and  family
    life) of the Human Rights Convention.

3.   The case turned on the state of  health  of  the  Appellants.   Due  to
    their respective health problems and age  the  Appellants  argued  that
    they needed long-term personal care which for various reasons they were
    unable to obtain to the required level in Pakistan.  They were  heavily
    reliant upon their daughter in this case,  the  Sponsor.  It  would  be
    disproportionate to require the Appellants to  return  to  Pakistan  in
    order to make an application  under  Appendix  FM  as  adult  dependent
    relatives.

The Determination at First Instance

4.   At paragraph 12 Judge O'Rourke set out his  findings.   The  Appellants
    had made previous visits to this country and returned  to  Pakistan  at
    the end of them but on their most recent visit 16th January  2014  they
    had  found  the  journey  difficult  and  needed  medical  care  as   a
    consequence.  The Appellants had told the Judge that they  needed  help
    from their family with tasks such  as  eating,  dressing  and  washing.
    However the Judge at paragraph 15(2) stated that it was not apparent to
    him that the Appellants' physical ailments were such as to require such
    assistance.

5.   The Judge had  before  him  medical  evidence  which  he  described  at
    paragraph 12(ii). There were letters from the Appellants' doctor in the
    United Kingdom dated  21st  January  2015  which  described  the  First
    Appellant  as  suffering  from  type  2  diabetes,  osteoarthritis  and
    hypertension.  His walking was  limited  and  his  blood  pressure  was
    controlled by medication.   His  diabetes  was  currently  only  poorly
    controlled but further medication was prescribed in tablet  form.   The
    Second  Appellant  was   suffering   from   arthralgia   with   minimal
    osteoarthritis which caused her distress and limited her mobility.  Her
    blood  pressure  was  controlled  by  medication  and  she  took  other
    medication for dyspepsia.  The First Appellant accepted in  court  that
    contrary to his statement he did not need help with the act  of  eating
    merely that meals be cooked for him.  Nor did he need help dressing but
    his clothes were washed for him. He would be unable to cook for himself
    if returned to Pakistan as the Second Appellant cooked for him.

6.   The Second Appellant was able to dress, feed and wash herself  but  her
    eyes were bad as she had the wrong lenses.  The Sponsor confirmed  that
    she washed, cooked and shopped for the couple  and  took  them  to  the
    doctor ensuring they took their  medication  and  checked  their  blood
    pressure.  The First Appellant had been unable to work in Pakistan  for
    some years due to pains in his leg and was dependent upon help from his
    family.  The Sponsor used to send between �100  and  �200  a  month  to
    them.  The First Appellant spent �100 a month in the United Kingdom  on
    medication.  Whilst medical care might not be so accessible in the part
    of Pakistan in which her parents lived the Sponsor accepted  that  they
    had in the past obtained such care.  Both the First Appellant  and  the
    Sponsor said they had attempted to obtain  day-to-day  assistance  with
    cooking and washing perhaps from a paid helper or maid  but  could  not
    find somebody sufficiently trustworthy.

7.   The Judge considered it implausible that the couple would  not  without
    their family's financial  assistance  be  able  to  find  a  person  in
    Pakistan who could assist them with cooking, clothes washing etc.   The
    couple had been able to access  medical  care  in  Pakistan  and  could
    obtain the same  medication  as  they  did  here.  There  would  be  an
    interference  with  family  life  but  it  would  be  pursuant  to  the
    legitimate aim of immigration control.  The Respondent's  decision  was
    proportionate to that aim because the Appellants  were  not  (at  least
    currently) at the level of requiring long-term personal care to perform
    everyday tasks.  As they  would  not  succeed  in  an  entry  clearance
    application now the doctrine in  Chikwamba  would  have  no  relevance.
    Although being cared for by their family  was  the  couple's  preferred
    option such care as they did need could be provided in  Pakistan  where
    they could be visited by their family so contact could continue.

The Onward Appeal

8.   The Appellants appealed against the Judge's decision to  dismiss  their
    appeal on two grounds.  The first was that  the  Judge  had  failed  to
    adequately consider or give sufficient weight to the medical  evidence.
    The Judge had two letters from their GP in the United Kingdom but  also
    two letters from their doctor in Pakistan. They expressly addressed the
    issues of the Appellants' current ailments and the  limitations  placed
    upon the Appellants by these ailments.  The Judge  had  not  considered
    this medical evidence in his  determination  beyond  outlining  in  his
    summary of the facts of the  case  what  was  stated  in  some  of  the
    letters.  Crucially the Judge when reaching his conclusions in  respect
    of the extent to which the Appellants needed  long-term  personal  care
    had not considered all the letters. There was no reasoned  analysis  of
    the medical evidence at all and no weight  was  attached  to  it.   The
    failure to evaluate it was a material error of law.

9.   The second ground was that there had been a failure  to  give  adequate
    reasons  for  a  material  finding.   The  Judge  had  found  that  the
    Appellants did  not  require  long-term  personal  care  but  the  only
    identifiable  reason  given  for  this  conclusion  referred   to   the
    Appellants' own evidence.  There was no consideration of other factors.
     The finding in respect of long-term personal care was material because
    the remainder of the Judge's decision in respect of Article 8  and  the
    Chikwamba argument turned on it.

10.  The application for permission to appeal  came  on  the  papers  before
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Pooler on 9th  April  2015.   Refusing
    permission to appeal he wrote that the Judge was aware of  the  medical
    evidence  before  the  Tribunal   as   the   grounds   themselves   had
    acknowledged.  The Judge had found that the Appellants'  oral  evidence
    was that neither of them needed help with feeding, dressing or  washing
    and in those circumstances it was open to the Judge to conclude despite
    the medical evidence that they did not need long-term personal care  to
    perform everyday tasks.  The  second  ground  had  submitted  that  the
    Judge's reasons for finding that the Appellants did not need  long-term
    personal care were inadequate because the only identifiable reason  was
    the Appellants' own evidence.  It was however open to the Judge to rely
    on the Appellants' evidence.  The reasons were adequate and  there  was
    no arguable error of law.

11.  Following that decision the Appellants renewed  their  application  for
    permission to appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal  in  substantially  longer
    grounds than had been submitted  to  the  First-tier.   The  Appellants
    relied on the family life they shared with their daughter  and  son-in-
    law and grandson which was more than normal emotional ties.  There  was
    an element of dependency between the parties.  But for  the  fact  that
    they were present in the  United  Kingdom  when  they  submitted  their
    application  for  leave  to  remain  the  Appellants  would  meet   the
    substantive requirements under the adult dependent relative  provisions
    of Section EC-DR.  As such the ratio in Chikwamba [2008] UKHL  40  that
    appeals should only rarely be dismissed on the basis that it  would  be
    more proportionate and more appropriate for an Appellant to  apply  for
    leave from abroad would apply.

12.  On the basis of the evidence in  respect  of  the  Appellants'  son-in-
    law's finances and the accommodation available to  them  the  financial
    requirements of ECDR would be met.  The Appellants would be  unable  to
    obtain the required level of care in Pakistan even with  the  financial
    help of their daughter and son-in-law.  The grounds proceeded to  quote
    from the letters before the Tribunal to emphasise what the  Appellants'
    care needs were.  Even if the  Appellants  could  not  meet  the  adult
    dependent  relative  requirements  on  application  from  Pakistan  the
    Respondent's decision to refuse their application was  disproportionate
    to the legitimate  aim  pursued.  The  Appellants  had  never  breached
    immigration laws in this country and would  be  financially  maintained
    and accommodated without recourse to public funds.  There was a  strong
    family life enjoyed by the dependent parents and their daughter, son-in-
    law and grandson.  The  latter  would  have  difficulty  travelling  to
    Pakistan to visit the  Appellants  because  of  fears  about  political
    conflict close to the Appellants' home area.

13.  This renewed application for  permission  came  on  the  papers  before
    Upper Tribunal Judge Eshun on 18th June 2015.  In  granting  permission
    to appeal she wrote that it was arguable that the Judge had  failed  to
    adequately consider or give sufficient weight to the  medical  evidence
    in respect of the Appellants' medical conditions and their care  needs;
    and failed to give adequate reasons for his finding that the Appellants
    do not require such care.  On 21st August 2015 the  Respondent  replied
    to the grant of permission by  letter  stating  that  she  opposed  the
    Appellants' appeal and that the Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal  had
    directed  himself   appropriately.    At   paragraph   15(2)   of   the
    determination the Judge had made findings open to  him  concerning  the
    severity of the Appellants' medical conditions.  At paragraph 15(4) the
    Judge had made findings that  the  Appellants  could  obtain  the  same
    medication  in  Pakistan.   There  was  no  material   error   in   the
    determination.  The grounds were nothing more than a disagreement  with
    the conclusions.

The Hearing Before Me

14.  Counsel for the Appellants relied on the skeleton  argument  which  had
    been filed for the hearing at first instance and which formed the basis
    of the onward appeal to the Upper Tribunal.  There had been no analysis
    by the Judge of the medical evidence or  the  diagnoses  given  to  the
    Appellants.  The Judge was aware he had medical evidence before him but
    made no  findings  thereon.   The  Judge  could  take  a  view  on  the
    Appellants' evidence but he  was  obliged  to  decide  on  the  medical
    evidence.  There was a need for the expert evidence to  be  given  some
    weight.  The Appellants could not cope alone.  It was  the  failure  to
    assess the medical evidence which gave rise to the error of law.

15.  In response the Presenting Officer relied on the Rule  24  reply.   The
    Tribunal had before it the medical evidence and  the  Judge  had  taken
    into account the contents of the letters from the Appellants' doctor in
    the  United  Kingdom.   That  medical  evidence  had  been   considered
    alongside other evidence.  Although there was a duty to give sufficient
    reasons they need not be elaborate.  The consideration of  the  medical
    evidence was adequate.  The Appellants did  not  need  long-term  care.
    The two grounds in the application for permission were linked  to  each
    other and both alleged a failure  to  provide  adequate  reasons.   The
    medical evidence itself which was before  the  Judge  was  of  numerous
    needs and conditions but it did not  demonstrate  that  the  Appellants
    required long-term care.  It was the  First  Appellant's  own  evidence
    that he did not need assistance  with  everyday  tasks,  and  in  those
    circumstances it was difficult to see how the First-tier Tribunal could
    have reached any other conclusion or say that he  did  need  assistance
    with everyday tasks.  Prior to the Appellants' arrival  in  the  United
    Kingdom in 2014 they had been receiving treatment in Pakistan  for  the
    conditions referred to in the medical evidence.  Other  services  could
    be obtained in Pakistan  with  financial  assistance  which  they  were
    receiving from family members.

16.  Finally in closing Counsel  reiterated  that  there  needed  to  be  an
    analysis of the doctor's evidence.  There had been a considerable focus
    by the Judge on the Appellants' oral evidence but expert  evidence  was
    there  and  there  needed  to  be  a  finding  on  it.   There  was  no
    consideration of the contents of Counsel's skeleton argument  submitted
    for the  hearing  at  first  instance.   There  was  an  inadequacy  of
    reasoning.  If there was a conflict between  the  Appellants'  evidence
    and the expert's evidence the Judge needed to decide upon that.

Findings

17.  The Appellants could not bring themselves within the Immigration  Rules
    and therefore had to argue that their appeals should be  allowed  under
    the provisions of Article 8.  The burden of proof of establishing  that
    Article 8 applied rested upon them and  the  usual  civil  standard  of
    balance of probabilities applied.  Although Article 8 can  encompass  a
    large variety of situations, the Appellant's argument in this case  was
    that as a result of age, illness or disability they required  long-term
    personal care to perform  everyday  tasks  see  Section  E-ECDR.2.4  of
    Appendix  FM.  They  satisfied  the  medical  requirements  for   entry
    clearance as dependent relatives.  The Appellants could not satisfy the
    provisions of ECDR because that section of Appendix  FM  requires  that
    the applicant must be outside the United Kingdom and must have  made  a
    valid application for entry clearance as an adult  dependent  relative.
    The Appellants could show neither of those  requirements.   They  based
    their Article 8 argument on their claim that they otherwise satisfied E-
    ECDR.2.4 and that it was unreasonable to expect them to have to  return
    to Pakistan to make an application from there.

18.  The chief complaint made against the  dismissal  of  their  appeals  by
    Judge  O'Rourke  was  that  he  had  not  given  any  or  any  adequate
    consideration to the medical evidence of  the  Appellants'  conditions.
    The Judge had the medical evidence before him in the  form  of  letters
    from UK doctors and the Appellants' Pakistan doctors.  He  also  had  a
    quantity of oral evidence from the First Appellant and the Sponsor  the
    Appellants' daughter.  The Judge summarised  the  medical  evidence  at
    paragraph 12(ii).  The complaint made is  that  that  summary  did  not
    include all of the relevant medical evidence and that in any event  the
    Judge did not say what of the  medical  evidence  he  did  or  did  not
    accept.

19.  I do not accept either of those two arguments.  Firstly the  Judge  was
    aware that the First Appellant's walking was limited.   Dr  Sadhra  (in
    the United Kingdom) had said that the First Appellant's capability  and
    distance was significantly compromised and Dr  Ul-Haque  (in  Pakistan)
    had said that the First Appellant had difficulty  in  walking.   It  is
    important to emphasise that this is a reasons-based challenge  and  the
    question therefore is whether the Judge has given adequate reasons such
    that a losing party can understand why they lost.  It was not necessary
    for the Judge to set out each and every  piece  of  evidence  that  was
    before him.  What the Judge has done is to summarise the thrust of  the
    medical evidence.  In my view there is very little  difference  between
    the summary which the Judge made of the medical evidence in relation to
    the First Appellant and what the  reports  themselves  said  especially
    insofar as the extracts quoted in the grounds of permission  to  appeal
    are concerned.

20.  The second challenge is that even if the Judge has set out an  adequate
    summary of the evidence before him he has not  analysed  it  adeuately.
    That indeed was the main argument made in the hearing before  me.   The
    issue turns on to what extent the medical evidence either differs  from
    or enlarges upon the oral evidence of the  Appellants  themselves  (and
    the Sponsor).  The Judge was focusing on whether the Appellants  needed
    assistance with eating, dressing and/or personal hygiene whether  their
    mobility might be limited did not come into  the  equation.   That  the
    Judge did not specifically refer to the medical evidence at that  point
    in his determination by saying he either accepted or  rejected  it  was
    irrelevant.  The medical evidence added nothing of significance to  the
    Judge's analysis of the Appellants' needs.  The  Judge's  reference  to
    the Appellants not needing assistance "by their  own  evidence"  is  an
    indication that the Judge was  basing  his  findings  on  the  relevant
    evidence before him.  It was not a  question  of  whether  the  medical
    evidence conflicted with the Appellants' evidence it was a question  of
    whether the  medical  evidence  advanced  the  Appellants'  case.   The
    Judge's reference at paragraph 15(ii) was an indication that he did not
    consider that it did advance the Appellants' case.  What the needs were
    was a factual matter to be decided upon the evidence of the person best
    placed to give it, that is the First Appellant.

21.  As to the Second Appellant the Judge summarised  her  medical  evidence
    and noted that her mobility too  was  limited.   The  Second  Appellant
    according to Dr Sadhra suffered from osteoarthritis of the  knees  with
    knee pain.  That was confirmed by Dr Ul-Haque.  He added that  she  had
    been  diagnosed  with  acid  peptic  ulcer  disease  which  caused  her
    significant abdominal pain.  The Judge noted the  dyspepsia  and  noted
    too that the Second Appellant took medication for that  as  indeed  her
    blood pressure too were controlled.  Even if the Judge did not  mention
    a doctor by name it was evident that he was aware of the content of the
    medical evidence. Upon return to Pakistan the Judge's view was that the
    Appellants could access the medication which they had  been  taking  up
    until now for their respective conditions  which  would  control  those
    conditions.  In short the conditions of themselves were not  sufficient
    to be able to establish that the  Appellants  would  all  things  being
    equal come within the requirements of E-ECDR-2.4.

22.  The grounds for permission to appeal complained that the Judge had  not
    taken sufficient heed of comments made by the doctors  that  the  First
    Appellant's  mobility  problems  required  dependency  on  the   Second
    Appellant and that the Second Appellant found it difficult to  maintain
    the upkeep of the  house  given  her  health  issues.   That  does  not
    indicate that the Appellants could show what concerned the Judge namely
    did the Appellants need assistance with eating,  dressing  or  personal
    hygiene?  It was not necessary for the Judge to rehearse each and every
    piece of evidence particularly if that evidence did not  establish  the
    Appellants' case.   What  was  missing  from  the  Appellants'  medical
    evidence was something which would satisfy the test in E-ECDR.2.4.

23.  The grant of permission to appeal referred in general terms to  whether
    the Judge had failed to give sufficient weight to the medical  evidence
    and the Appellants' care needs and the finding that the Appellants  did
    not require care.  I find that the Judge has given  sufficient  reasons
    for his conclusions that the Appellants cannot show they require  long-
    term  personal  care  to  perform  everyday  tasks.    As   the   Judge
    acknowledged that position may change in the future but he was  obliged
    to look at the position as it was at the date of hearing.  It was not a
    question that he preferred the oral evidence of the Appellants  to  the
    medical evidence of the doctors but rather that the medical evidence of
    the doctors did not  significantly  advance  the  Appellants'  case  or
    contradict what the Appellants themselves had said.

24.  The Judge made a finding that  the  Appellants  could  access  care  in
    Pakistan to assist them with cooking, clothes, washing  etc.  tasks  at
    present apparently done by the Sponsor.  That was a finding  which  was
    open to  the  Judge  on  the  evidence  and  I  would  agree  with  the
    Respondent's  submissions  that  in  that  respect  the   grounds   for
    permission to appeal are a mere disagreement with the  Judge's  adverse
    conclusions.  No adequate  reasons  were  given  why  in  a  large  and
    populous country such as Pakistan such assistance could  not  be  found
    given the level of funds available to pay for such  care.   Furthermore
    the Appellants had received adequate medical care in Pakistan (from  Dr
    Ul Haque who described the Second Appellant as  a  regular  patient  of
    his) and there was no reason why that could not continue.  That too was
    a conclusion open to the Judge on the evidence.

25.  Although that was the principal  focus  of  the  case  and  indeed  the
    submissions made to me, it is fair to say that there were other Article
    8 arguments raised before the Judge (and referred to in the grounds for
    permission to appeal).  These related to the relationship  between  the
    Appellants and the Sponsor and her family and the difficulties  of  the
    Sponsor's  family  travelling  to  Pakistan  to  visit  and  also   the
    "Chikwamba"  argument   Insofar  as  Chikwamba  was  concerned  if  the
    Appellants could not succeed in an out of country  application  because
    they could not meet E-ECDR.2.4 for the reasons given by  the  Judge  it
    would be a bizarre and unsatisfactory result for them  to  be  able  to
    resist removal the weaker was their future  case  for  entry  clearance
    from abroad.  In order to pray-in-aid Chikwamba the Appellants  had  to
    show that but for the fact they were in the United Kingdom  they  would
    otherwise succeed in an application for  entry  clearance.   This  they
    could not show for the reasons given by the Judge (that  they  did  not
    come within ECDR whose reasoning on the  point  did  not  amount  to  a
    material error of law.

26.  The  Judge  dealt  with  the  remainder  of  the  Article  8  claim  at
    paragraphs 22(iii) and (iv) when he said that although being cared  for
    by their family in the United Kingdom  was  the  Appellants'  preferred
    option such care as they did need could be provided in  Pakistan.   The
    Appellants and their family had visited each  other  in  the  past  and
    could communicate daily so such contact could continue assisting in the
    maintenance of family life. There was little if any evidence to support
    the assertion that difficulties in the Appellants' home area would make
    visiting difficult. The family life which the  Appellants  had  enjoyed
    with the Sponsor's family had only been experienced for the  last  year
    whereas the Sponsor had now been in the United  Kingdom  for  at  least
    five years (see paragraph 19 of the determination). It was open to  the
    Judge to find on the facts before him that the  interference  with  the
    Appellants' private and family life by  requiring  them  to  return  to
    Pakistan and refusing their applications for further  leave  to  remain
    was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.  I  therefore  dismiss
    the appeal in this case.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve  the  making  of  an
error of law and I uphold the decision to dismiss the  Appellants'  appeals.


Appeals dismissed.

I make no anonymity order as there is no public policy reason for so  doing.
