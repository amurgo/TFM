[Return to Sudan safe for man with no political profile, eastern Sudanese
(African origin) returning with young family.  AE applied and US State
Department Report (not before Tribunal in AE) considered.  Must show
individual risk to appellant; Darfurian origin or African ethnicity alone
insufficient.  No risk at Convention level to non-Darfurian Sudanese.

Conditions in camps not ideal but evidence not sufficient to establish that
internal relocation to internally displaced person camp in Khartoum alone
enough to meet ECHR Article 2 and 3.  Risk in internally displaced person
camps limited on present evidence to  students, lawyers, merchants, traders
or those with perceived rebel profile who are of African ethnicity.  Those
with family members still in Sudan required to prove need to use internally
displaced persons' camp.]


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1. This case is reported for what it says at paragraphs 56-61 about risks
   to failed asylum seekers returning to the Khartoum area of Sudan, where
   that is not their home area, and in particular, to the risks in Khartoum
   internally displaced persons' camps.  The hearing was a continuation
   reconsideration of the appellant's appeal,   remitted for fresh
   consideration by the Immigration Appeal Tribunal before 4 April 2005,
   when the present Tribunal succeeded it.  The procedural history of the
   appellant's claim is as follows:  the appellant arrived in the United
   Kingdom on 20 October 2002 and applied for asylum two days later.  His
   asylum claim rests upon his family and personal connection with the Beja
   Congress Party in the Sudan.

2. The Secretary of State refused to recognise him as a refugee, the
   reasons appearing in a letter accompanying a notice of refusal dated 10
   January 2003.  The letter of refusal also dealt adversely with his
   Article 2 and 3 claims under the European Convention on Human Rights and
   Fundamental Freedoms 1950.

3. The Secretary of State's reasoning was that the appellant's account was
   vague, unconvincing and lacked substantive detail or any credible
   corroborative evidence (although of course, in asylum cases,
   corroborative evidence is not a requirement).  The Secretary of State
   expressed credibility reservations in relation to the appellant's account
   of his political activities, his escape from hospital on payment of a
   bribe, his time in hiding with his uncle, and his exit from Sudan.
   Overall, the appellant considered that the appellant was not telling the
   truth and that there was no risk on return.

History of this appeal
4. The appellant appealed to an Adjudicator (as she then was).  The Grounds
   of Appeal suggested that the Secretary of State's decision was against
   the weight of evidence, that the claim of political and ethnic exclusion
   and discrimination had not been dealt with, and that his claim engaged
   Articles 2, 3, 6, and 8 of 'the Human Rights Act 1998'[sic], which is
   presumably a reference to the European Convention on Human Rights.
   Article 6 is not applicable in asylum determinations (Maaouia v France
   (2001) 33 EHRR 42).  The appellant did not rely upon Article 8 ECHR at
   the Adjudicator hearing.   The appellant's wife had remained in the Sudan
   when the appellant fled but she joined him here in   29 June 2003, a fact
   which the appellant chose not to disclose or rely upon until the hearing
   of the reconsideration on 18 May 2005.  The appellant has been legally
   represented throughout, at first by Dillons & Co, and latterly by Noden &
   Company.

5. The appellant gave evidence at the Adjudicator hearing.  The Adjudicator
   did not find his account credible, for the reasons she set out in
   paragraphs 15-26 of her determination, and considered that the appellant
   would not be at risk if returned to Sudan today.  The appellant appealed,
   characterising the Adjudicator's consideration of credibility as
   speculative and inadequate, and relying upon Chiver (10758).  The
   appellant contended that the Adjudicator's determination lacked anxious
   scrutiny.  The IAT granted permission to appeal on concerns about the
   Adjudicator's treatment of the claimed detention and the appellant's
   claimed political activities.

6. The Immigration Appeal Tribunal allowed the appellant's appeal.  It
   considered that the determination was almost entirely devoid of factual
   findings, in particular in relation to the claimed arrest and detention
   of the appellant.  The IAT remitted the appeal for hearing afresh.

Preliminary issue
7. At the beginning of the hearing, there was a preliminary issue.  The
   appellant alleged that his wife had applied on arrival, or soon after, to
   Immigration Officers at Croydon to be treated as his dependant, and asked
   therefore that she and the two children be treated as dependants for
   Article 8 purposes in the reconsideration hearing.  There had been no
   advance notice of this argument and no evidence was available to support
   the suggestion that the Secretary of State (and the appellant's
   representative) had overlooked the dependency element in the preceding
   two years, despite hearings at first and second instance.  A skeleton
   argument was produced at the hearing before this panel, but not until the
   hearing had begun, which deals for the first time with Article 8, arguing
   that the appellant and his wife have an established private and family
   life and that to ask his wife to return to Sudan with him would
   constitute a disproportionate interference with this appellant's Article
   8 rights.  We shall return to that argument.

8. The Home Office Presenting Officer objected to the dependency
   application as far too late and taking her by surprise.  She was however
   able to deal with the skeleton argument and a witness statement signed by
   the appellant's wife the day before the hearing (which also,
   unfortunately, was not disclosed until the middle of the hearing before
   us).

9. We had hoped to hear evidence from the person at the appellant's
   solicitors with conduct of these proceedings, to explain (with the file)
   why the dependency claim was raised so late.  We adjourned when the
   problem became apparent, and directed Mr Quee, who is not legally
   qualified, to telephone Miss Shamim, who has conduct, and ask her to
   attend court.  Mr Quee indicated that Miss Shamim had initially refused
   to attend, and then, after taking advice from her supervisor, indicated
   that 'she was in difficulty but if [the Tribunal] insist that she should
   come to Court, she will have to leave what she is doing to come, so as to
   arrive at 2 p.m. If you insist, however, given her workload she is
   prepared to send a letter to Court to confirm what she disclosed to [Mr
   Quee]".  That was a completely inappropriate reaction to a direction from
   the Tribunal to attend.  On further questioning Mr Quee, it appears that
   Miss Shamim is not a solicitor (and nor is Mr Quee).  We decided to
   proceed with the documents which had become available during the
   adjournment, the skeleton argument and the appellant's wife's witness
   statement, but we record our concern as to the casual treatment of this
   appellant's claim and this Tribunal by Noden & Company.

10. Absent any evidence of the alleged visit to Croydon to claim as a
   dependant in 2003, or any mention of his wife and children before the
   Adjudicator or the Immigration Appeal Tribunal, we refused the variation
   application and proceeded to hear the reconsideration substantively.  It
   may be that the appellant's wife and children have their own claim, but
   that is not a decision with which we are seised, that claim having
   apparently not been made yet to the Secretary of State, let alone
   refused.

11. The professional issue has no relevance to the outcome of this appeal
   and we put it out of our minds in considering whether the appellant could
   show a credible account putting him at risk on return.  The Tribunal
   decided to refuse the application to add the appellant's wife and United
   Kingdom-born children as dependants at this late stage.

12. We then proceeded to deal with the substantive reconsideration, on the
   basis that the original Adjudicator had made a material error of law and
   that further findings of fact were needed before we could proceed under
   rule 31(3) to substitute a fresh decision to allow or dismiss the appeal.

13. The Tribunal heard oral evidence from the appellant and his wife, and
   oral and written argument from the appellant's legal representative.  We
   also heard oral argument from the Presenting Officer.

Standard and burden of proof
14. We reminded ourselves of the low standard of proof appropriate to
   claims under the Geneva Convention on the Status of Refugees and
   Stateless Persons 1951, its protocols, and the European Convention on
   Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms 1950.  The appellant must show a
   reasonable degree of likelihood or real risk that his core account is
   true, and that the appellant would suffer persecution or treatment
   contrary to the relevant Article of the ECHR on return to the Sudan.
   Such a credibility decision must be based on all the evidence before us,
   including oral evidence, personal documents, and country background
   evidence of country conditions.   We also remind ourselves that in
   certain circumstances, even a returning asylum seeker whose claim is not
   credible may be at risk, and that we must therefore consider the country
   background evidence in this respect also. The burden of proof, at the
   lower standard, remains on the appellant to show that his claim engages a
   relevant provision of the Refugee Convention or ECHR.

Documents and materials before the Tribunal
15. We had the following evidence and materials before us for the hearing:

        a) The Home Office bundle and all material previously filed

        b) The Adjudicator's and Immigration Appeal Tribunal
           determinations;

        c) a bundle (60 pages) of personal and country background evidence
           filed by the appellant under cover of a letter of 3 May 2005;

        d) a skeleton argument dated 13 May 2005, produced at the hearing
           today;

        e) an additional witness statement, for Mrs Ramli Mazza Khaled,
           dated 17 May 2005, produced at the hearing today; and

        f) CIPU Country Report for Sudan, April 2005, filed at the hearing
           today by the Presenting Officer.

16. The appellant's bundle contains a letter purporting to be from the Beja
   Congress Party in the United Kingdom.  Dr MA Sharif, a Consultant
   Psychiatrist who does not indicate his r�le in the local Party, writes on
   badly photocopied letterhead with a hand-written address at the top.  Dr
   Sharif recites the appellant's account but not from his own knowledge.
   Dr Sharif does not mention any United Kingdom activities undertaken by
   the appellant.  Dr Sharif begs that the appellant be allowed to stay,
   offers to be telephoned and to attend Court 'if I have no commitments'.
   Even if genuine, this letter is of little value to us in assessing the
   appellant's commitment, if any, to the Beja Congress Party, either in the
   United Kingdom or in his country of origin.

17. The bundle of papers prepared for our hearing includes two birth
   certificates for children born to the appellant and his Sudanese wife,
   Mazza Ramil Khaled. They now have two British-born children: a son,
   Mohamed Mohamed Lufty (born 16 February 2004) and a daughter, Zeinab
   Lutfuy Mohamed (born very recently, 29 March 2005).   Those dates are
   consistent with her arrival in the United Kingdom in 29 June 2003 as now
   stated.

   The appellant's evidence and core account
18.  The appellant's core claim is this:  he was born in Sudan on 15 May
   1969, and attended primary and technical school until 1985, when he
   completed his education and trained as a carpenter.  In 1986, the
   appellant established a carpentry workshop, and in 1988, the appellant
   also became a broker.  In 1992, the appellant claims to have joined the
   Beja Congress Party.  In August 1998, the National Islamic Security Junta
   arrested the appellant's father.

19. On 18 December 1998, the appellant married Ramli Khaled.  On 10 June
   1999, his father was released, but sadly died nine days later because of
   his treatment in detention.  Eighteen months later, on 10 January 2002,
   the appellant's home was raided and the appellant was arrested.  The
   appellant was transferred to Sawaken Prison on 11 July 2002, and
   hospitalised (under guard) on 25 September 2002.  The appellant 'escaped'
   five days later after his uncle paid a bribe.  The uncle, who is a
   wealthy man and a trained broker also, sheltered him until 19 October
   2002, when the appellant was taken to Khartoum and introduced to an
   agent.  On 20 October 2002, the appellant flew to the United Kingdom,
   where the appellant claimed asylum on 22 October 2002.

20. The appellant's Statement of Evidence Form indicated reliance on
   Refugee Convention grounds of race, ethnic origin or nationality and
   political opinion.  The appellant claimed that his father was arrested
   for his political involvement with the Beja Congress Party, of which the
   appellant was a Port Sudan Committee member.  That is not the appellant's
   case now; the appellant says his father was a farmer and was arrested in
   error.  It was not his case in the Statement of Evidence Form that either
   the appellant or his father was charged with any offence, but he contends
   that both were detained for Beja Congress Party activities. The appellant
   claimed the Beja Congress Party was operating clandestinely in Sudan.
   The appellant claimed to be an ordinary active member, and that the Party
   wanted to topple the dictatorial r�gime in Sudan, and stood for genuine
   democracy, equality of nations and nationalities, multi-party Government
   in Sudan, fair and free elections and freedom of speech and press.    The
   Party was a banned Party and rallies, demonstrations and public meetings
   were forbidden.

21. The appellant set out the tortures suffered by him.  The Statement of
   Evidence Form version was vague:  'assault, harassment and gender
   abuse...punished, degraded as human being and my human rights was
   violated'.    In the statement accompanying the Statement of Evidence
   Form, the appellant claims to have been 'beaten and interrogated' and
   asked to provide names of members.  The appellant became ill and had
   malaria, hence the hospital admission.  His uncle paid a bribe and the
   appellant went to Senkat to hide before leaving for the United Kingdom.

22. At his asylum interview, the appellant's account evolved.  The
   appellant now claimed that he had been recruiting members and
   distributing leaflets for the Beja Congress Party.  Meetings took place
   in the house of one of the members (usually the appellant's home), but
   his house had no address, as the house was temporary accommodation.  The
   appellant could not give a street name, nor even an area.  It was his job
   to collect donations from new members.  The appellant claimed that the
   organisation demonstrated for schools and hospitals, but the
   demonstrations were inconclusive because of aggression by the security
   forces.  The last demonstration the appellant attended was in September
   2002, which is odd, as the appellant was in hospital or in hiding during
   that month on his earlier account.

23. The appellant now claimed the security forces came to his home on
   suspicion that the appellant had leaflets there.   They suspected him,
   and were monitoring his movements.  The appellant had received no medical
   treatment for his injuries, apart from some tablets on one occasion. The
   ill-treatment was now described as beatings, having water dropped all
   over his body while asleep, and personal abuse.   The appellant received
   no medical treatment for the consequences of this ill-treatment, so on
   that basis, the hospitalisation must have been for his malaria.

24. The appellant explained more about his escape.  The guard of the back
   gate of the prison had helped him to escape in return for a bribe.
   Senkat was half an hour by car from the Port Sudan.   His uncle smuggled
   him to Khartoum in the back of a lorry and paid approximately $3500 for
   his travel to the United Kingdom. The appellant got through the airport
   by changing out of the Jalabiya, which everyone in Sudan wore, into a
   shirt and trousers, which he claims was enough to prove an effective
   disguise.  The appellant had no travel documents; the agent saw to
   everything.  A person in the airport in the United Kingdom told him how
   to apply for asylum.   The appellant was concerned about his wife, who
   was still in Sudan, as the appellant had not heard anything about her
   (this was in November 2002).

25. In his evidence to the Adjudicator in November 2003, the appellant
   added that security forces found no leaflets when searching his home.
   His carpentry business had failed, which was why the appellant had become
   a broker.  The appellant still relied on only one arrest.

   Oral evidence before this Tribunal
26. We have heard evidence from the appellant and his wife.  Mrs Ramli
   Mazza Khaled gave evidence in Arabic against a short witness statement,
   which confirms the birth of the children.  The statement recites that it
   was translated to her, but it was not.  She told us that the solicitors
   gave her the statement to sign, and she simply signed it.  The address
   for residence given is incorrect;  although the appellant's wife signed
   her statement the day before the hearing, neither the appellant nor his
   wife could tell the Tribunal with any certainty what their new address
   was.

27. Mrs Khaled was not well.  She has medical consequences from the birth
   of their daughter (no medical report, but she was obviously
   uncomfortable).  She could not sit down, so gave her evidence standing
   and walking round the Court.  We took her evidence as briefly as
   possible, since she looked as though she might faint.  His wife found her
   way to the appellant without difficulty in late June 2003 despite their
   having completely lost touch after his escape from Sudan.    She knew the
   appellant was here.  She had no evidence of having claimed as a dependant
   in June 2003.  She was from the Beja tribe also.

28. We then heard the evidence of the appellant.  The appellant had signed
   a witness statement which recited interpretation by two different people
   (irreconcilably).  The address was wrong and the appellant could not say
   where he and his family lived now.  He signed that statement on 21 April
   2005.   The appellant asserted in that statement that the Beja Congress
   Party was still banned and that the agent might have provided false
   identity documents for him.  The appellant did not know whether the
   documents were false or not, and that does not seem to have troubled him.
    The appellant could now provide evidence of his membership of the Party.
    All members of the Beja ethnic group in Sudan were persecuted.  In
   supplementary questioning from his representative, the appellant adopted
   the other evidence, and asserted a continuing fear on return.  The
   authorities in Sudan would not have forgotten him and would torture him
   again.

29. We took cross-examination after the short adjournment.   The appellant
   confirmed the expanded version of his r�le given since the asylum
   interview.  The reason the authorities had not found the leaflets was
   that they were stored with a friend of his, in a ditch.  The appellant
   was unaware of the armed struggle and violence in which the Beja Congress
   Party had become involved in 1989.  The appellant thought the Party's
   unilateral ceasefire began in 1992 (it was December 2003).

30. The appellant himself had not taken part in any demonstrations.  The
   appellant was unable to explain how a secret organisation managed to hold
   public demonstrations, as he had not attended any.  The appellant cast
   aspersions on the standard of interpretation of the asylum interview, but
   these had not been raised previously.  The appellant now claimed to have
   been tortured with hot irons (a version given for the first time before
   the Adjudicator).  The appellant showed the Tribunal body scars, but
   there was no medical report as to how, or when, they might have been
   sustained.

31. In relation to his stay in hospital and his escape, the appellant could
   not describe how many beds there were, either in his prison cell or the
   hospital ward.  He claimed to have shared a ward with another person, who
   received visitors regularly.  The doors were open at all times and anyone
   could have visitors.  When the time came for his escape, the guard gave
   him a Jalabiya to change into, and then went to get the other man a glass
   of water and the appellant simply walked out.  The appellant had no idea
   how big the bribe to the guard for his release had been. The appellant
   had grown a beard in detention (mentioned for the first time before us)
   and so was unrecognisable at the airport later.   We consider that his
   captors would have noticed the beard and adjusted any description
   accordingly if one were circulated.

Submissions

32. Ms Tedeschini relied primarily upon the letter of refusal.  The
   appellant's account was riddled with discrepancies and should be treated
   as incredible. She cited the secret nature of the Party as contrasted
   with the public demonstrations; the variable nature of the escape and
   torture accounts; the appellant's three weeks in Senkat without
   difficulties; and the lack of medical evidence.  Merely changing into
   western clothes at the airport would not have been sufficient to disguise
   the appellant's identity, as the authorities would check very thoroughly
   for people on their 'wanted' list and they would certainly have been
   looking for a bearded man, if the appellant had a beard when he escaped,
   as now claimed. She asked us to place very little weight on the London
   Beja Congress Party letter.

33. Even if the appellant's account were credible, the appellant was never
   charged and there was no current evidence that mere membership of the
   Beja Congress Party was enough to put him at risk on return.  Articles 2
   and 3 should stand or fall with the asylum claim.  As regards Article 8,
   there was no family member with settled status in the United Kingdom and
   the appellant and his family had not been in the United Kingdom for very
   long.  It was not disproportionate to expect him to return with his wife
   and two children and resume living in Sudan.

34. Ms Tedeschini asked us to dismiss the appeal.

35. For the appellant, Mr Quee referred to his skeleton argument.  That
   document, dated 13 May 2005, does not deal with the current estrangement
   between the NDA and the Beja Congress Party, but relies on their previous
   links.   The Tribunal is asked to recognise the appellant's non-Arab
   ethnicity, his former and continuing membership of the Beja Congress
   Party, his political activities and consequent status as an opponent of
   the Sudanese Government, and the risk from the Janjaweed on return.   In
   relation to the Refugee Convention, similar arguments are repeated more
   shortly on Articles 2 and 3, coupled with an allegation that there is in
   Sudan a blatant disregard for human rights with impunity, such that even
   suspected political opponents are treated in a manner contrary to Article
   3 ECHR.

36. The skeleton argument contends that the appellant has established
   private and family life within the meaning of Article 8 ECHR in the
   United Kingdom in view of his three years' stay here.  The only specific
   matter relied upon is his re-established family life with his wife, who
   has no separate claim or status, and has presented him with two children
   since coming to the United Kingdom.  The appellant argues that return to
   Sudan would be disproportionate in the light of the deteriorating human
   rights situation there and thus an unlawful interference with his Article
   8 rights.

37.  In his oral submissions, Mr Quee accepted that Articles 2 and 3 of
   European Convention on Human Rights would stand or fall with the asylum
   claim.  Mr Quee relied upon Huang, Abu Qulbain and Kashmiri [2005] EWCA
   Civ 105 and the test therein of 'truly exceptional' circumstances.  Taken
   in the round, the appellant argued that this appellant's circumstances
   were indeed truly exceptional in the light of the ongoing conflict in
   Eastern Sudan (paragraphs 6.123-6.126, and 6.216).  It was not always
   safe for those returning to their homes.

38. Mr Quee invited the Tribunal to find that the appellant would return
   with his wife and children, who were both very young indeed.  The
   appellant would return to Sudan, where the situation in internally
   displaced persons camps was not ideal.  The appellant would make his way
   to eastern Sudan, where the appellant would be in difficulty.  The
   Tribunal reminded Mr Quee that the test was not whether it was ideal but
   whether it would be unduly harsh or unreasonable to return this appellant
   and his family to Khartoum.  Mr Quee argued that as the appellant came
   from a non-Arab ethnic group, it would indeed be unduly harsh to return
   him, especially given the complicity of the Sudanese Government in
   relation to the activities of the Janjaweed and the likely treatment of
   the family in an internally displaced person camp.

39. The appellant asked the Tribunal to assess the appellant's evidence and
   make appropriate findings in the light of the evidence.  If it were
   credible that the appellant had been involved with the Beja Congress
   Party in Sudan or the United Kingdom, Mr Quee relied upon p104 of the
   CIPU Country Report on Sudan linking the Beja Congress Party and NDA.
   The appellant would be regarded as a suspected opponent of the r�gime
   (paragraphs 6.2, and pages B7 and B10 of the appellant's bundle).  There
   was an ongoing conflict between the Sudanese Government and persons
   residing in the eastern part of Sudan.  Paragraphs 6.123 and 6.126 of the
   Report reflected the likely risk on return.

40. As to the method of escape, checks at the airport were casual
   (paragraph 6.1140).  In his own country background bundle Mr Quee relied
   only upon excerpts from the April 2005 CIPU Country Report as set out
   above, and two passages in the 2004 US State Department Report (pages B7
   and B10 of that bundle) indicating that there were ongoing difficulties
   with the security forces in Sudan, and that there was still a pattern of
   short detentions without charge, with or without torture, under the
   present Government.  We consider that in some detail, since it appears
   that this document was not placed before the President's Tribunal when it
   considered the case of AE.  Mr Quee did not rely upon any other country
   background documents in his bundle (though we did see and consider the
   birth certificates and the London Beja Congress Party letter).

41. The Tribunal reserved its determination for postal delivery, which we
   now give.

Summary of country background evidence
42. The CIPU Country Report for April 2005 gives a chronology of events in
   Sudan, in which the relevant milestones are as follows. In 1989, Lt
   General Omar Hassan Ahmed Al-Bashir took power after a bloodless coup and
   dismantled the civilian ruling apparatus, banning political parties and
   declaring a state of emergency.  The Beja Congress Party turned to armed
   struggle in that year.  Mr Al-Bashir remains in power.  Since 1999,
   political parties are permitted again under strict conditions, and
   opposition parties which comply may contest elections (5.16).  There were
   20 officially registered political parties at the end of 2004 (5.17).
   The Political Parties Act allows some formerly banned parties to resume
   their activities, but they must notify the registrar in writing to
   participate in elections.

43. The country has suffered a 21-year north-south civil war, but since
   August 2004, efforts are being made to end it, in the light of the
   humanitarian crisis in Darfur.  Human rights abuses have been committed
   in Darfur by both sides.  The Government signed a permanent ceasefire
   with the SPLM/A in December 2004, and peace talks are continuing with the
   SPLM/A, the JEM, and the NDA. A unilateral ceasefire has been in effect
   since November 2003 pending the north-south peace talks.  The Beja
   Congress Party declined to attend the  January 2005 Government of Sudan
   talks with the NDA in Cairo which led to a preliminary peace agreement
   between those two parties, instead presenting a list of demands to the
   Government authorities in Port Sudan, and there appears to be a split
   between  the two parties.  The Beja Congress Party and the Free Lions
   Association are now reported to have merged to form a new group called
   the Eastern Front.

44. There was a mass demonstration by thousands of Beja in support of the
   Beja Congress Party demands in January 2005.  The security forces fired
   on the demonstration when protesters began rioting; excessive force was
   used. (6.126)  Demonstrations remain banned and the Government broke up
   demonstrations in Port Sudan in east Sudan in  January and February 2005,
   with deaths and arrests of demonstrators as the demonstration against
   socio-economic and political marginalisation turned violent (6.67).  It
   is clear from the evidence that those with a genuine political profile
   may well be at risk on return today.

45. The Beja have suffered long-term discrimination (6.123) and are
   vulnerable to malnutrition, famine and contagious disease in Eastern
   Sudan.

46. in relation to transit through the airport, paragraphs 6.113-6.114
   confirm that bribery has been used to obtain passports, exit visas and to
   pass border controls, provided individual travellers are not specifically
   'wanted'.  As recently as 2005, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office
   accepted in a letter that it was probable that bribery was used for these
   purposes but that the FCO had been unable to source or verify that
   assumption.

47. IRIN recorded in October 2004 and February 2005 that it was not always
   safe for those returning to their homes (6.216).   Paragraph 6.107
   indicates that Article 23 of the 1998 Constitution of the Republic of
   Sudan guarantees freedom of movement and residence, of exit and entry to
   Sudan, and the US State Department Report for 2004 published on 28
   February 2005 indicates that movement was generally unhindered for
   citizens outside the war zones, provided they could produce an identity
   card.  Sudanese embassies abroad would issue passports to Sudanese
   nationals on proof of identity (paragraph 6.109).

Findings of Fact and Credibility
48. We considered first what facts had been proved to the appropriate lower
   standard by the appellant's evidence.  The appellant no longer contends
   that his father was associated with the Beja Congress Party.  The
   appellant is a carpenter by trade, whose business failed.  The appellant
   and his uncle were brokers, and the appellant lived and worked in Port
   Sudan in eastern Sudan, the home of the Beja tribe, who suffer
   discrimination in that area.  The appellant is married to a woman of the
   Beja tribe and they now have two children born in the United Kingdom.
   Those facts are accepted.

49. The question is whether any of the appellant's account about his Beja
   Congress Party membership can be accepted as credible, even at the lower
   standard appropriate for the Geneva Convention on the Status of Refugees
   and Stateless Persons 1951 and the European Convention on Human Rights
   and Fundamental Freedoms 1950.

50. We reminded ourselves of the incremental nature of the appellant's
   account; of his statement that the ceasefire was in 1992 (it was in
   December 2003); of his conflicting account as to whether the appellant
   attended demonstrations and his lack of knowledge of the armed struggle
   in which the Beja Congress Party has been engaged since 1989.  We also
   considered the points set out in the Secretary of State's submissions at
   paragraph 31 above.

51. We do not believe, even to the lower standard, that the appellant was,
   or is, a member of the Beja Congress Party.  His knowledge of the Party
   is simply too sketchy to be credible at any level.

52. The letter of support from Dr Sharif of the United Kingdom Beja
   Congress Party does not assist us; we are not satisfied that it is a
   genuine document, to in line with the guidance set by the Immigration
   Appeal Tribunal in Tanveer Ahmed [2002] UKIAT 00439 (starred).  Even if
   it were genuine, the letter consists only of a recital of the appellant's
   own account.  It shows no knowledge of any activities the appellant may
   have undertaken in the United Kingdom or elsewhere.

53. If we are wrong, and the appellant had some limited Beja Congress Party
   sympathy or involvement, we find that it was at the lowest possible level
   and that the appellant has no political profile, which is confirmed by
   the ease with which the appellant passed through the airport on his way
   to the United Kingdom.  We note that on his own (latest) account, the
   appellant has never attended a demonstration and thus would not be
   publicly identified with a party which, despite his allegations to the
   contrary, is not a secret organisation, but has a public profile enabling
   it to put demands on behalf of the Beja to the Sudanese Government.

54. We entirely disbelieve the account of his detention and escape.  The
   appellant could not describe his cell or the hospital room with any
   accuracy.  There were multiple discrepancies in the appellant's account
   of how the appellant left the hospital.  Most significantly, the account
   of his abuse at the hands of the security forces changed dramatically in
   each version.  At the top of each shoulder, the appellant has two well-
   faded parallel lines of identical length, which look rather like
   epaulette stripes.  They could be anything; they could even be a tribal
   mark.  There is also a similar mark on one elbow and one wrist.  Absent
   medical evidence, it is impossible to conclude that these are reasonably
   likely to be torture scars.  The appellant told us that the marks did not
   require treatment; they healed by themselves.

55. We also note that the appellant concealed the arrival of his wife and
   we do not believe that they lost contact.  It is clear from her evidence
   that she came to the United Kingdom to join him and knew precisely where
   to find the appellant on arrival.  Two children now enlarge the family
   unit and we see no insurmountable obstacle to their returning to Sudan as
   a family unit today.

56. We considered whether we should make an adverse credibility finding
   based upon section 8 of the 2004 Act.  We consider that the appellant's
   failure to disclose the arrival of his wife and the existence of his two
   young children until the second hearing at first instance is conduct
   under s.8 (2) (a) and (c) and does further damage his credibility, but
   that damage is not material in that we have already found his core
   account to be incredible even at the lower standard appropriate for
   Refugee Convention and ECHR claims.

Conclusions
57. The appellant therefore falls to be treated as a person with no
   particular profile, returning to Sudan with his wife and young family.
   The appellant would be returned to Khartoum.  It is for him to decide
   whether to seek to return to his home in the east, and it may be that the
   appellant does not consider that appropriate.  We considered whether it
   would be unduly harsh to expect the family to remain in the Khartoum
   area, even if that meant living in an internally displaced persons' camp.



58. We are guided in relation to internal relocation to Khartoum, by the
   recent decision of the President and Deputy President of this Tribunal in
   AE (Relocation-Darfur-Khartoum an option) Sudan CG [2005] UKAIT 00101 -
   1. "On the 18th May 2004 UNHCR accepted that "Sudanese of non Arab
      Darfurian background returning to Sudan faced heightened risk of
      scrutiny by the security apparatus ... internally displaced persons
      from Darfur often faced protection risks including forced relocation
      and forced return". But the area around Khartoum has 1.8 million
      internally displaced persons of who some hundreds of thousands are
      from the Darfur region and most of whom will be from the "African"
      tribal groups. This appellant was found to be at risk of persecution
      in Darfur because of his ethnic origin. To suggest that this appellant
      on any return and on relocation to Khartoum faces a real risk of
      persecution or indeed a real risk of ill-treatment contrary to Article
      3 of the European Convention on Human Rights is tantamount to
      accepting that all and every internally displaced person within
      Khartoum faces such a risk. Had that been the case we are satisfied
      that UNHCR with long and careful knowledge of the area would have so
      indicated by now. Internally displaced persons in the Khartoum area
      clearly face a number of difficulties. It may be that for some there
      may be a real risk arising out of the fact that the authorities would
      target them as active sympathisers of armed rebel groups or as persons
      connected with opposition political groups. But we cannot accept that
      there is a real risk there to this individual appellant. We are
      conscious of having to consider this matter on a "case by case" basis
      as urged by UNHCR. There is no evidence to suggest that this appellant
      would be perceived as involved with armed rebel groups or opposition
      political groups or that the appellant would inextricably be driven to
      the worst circumstances for internally displaced persons in Khartoum,
      where ever they may be. The previous decisions of the IAT, which we
      accept, do not suggest there is likely to be an automatic risk of
      serious harm or ill-treatment contrary to Article 3 in the Khartoum
      area.
   1. Nor do we accept that this appellant will be singled out at Khartoum
      airport on any return. His ethnicity may be clear but it does not
      follow from that that the appellant will be targeted, arrested and
      persecuted or ill-treated"

59. We note that (page 21 of 31 of the US State Department Report for 2004)-


   "There were estimates  that  up  to  4  million  persons  were  displaced
   internally due to the  civil  war.   ...Tens  of  thousands  of  persons,
   largely southerners and westerners displaced by  famine  and  civil  war,
   continued  to  live  in  squatter   slums   ringing   Khartoum.   Refugee
   International researchers estimated that more than 300,000  refugees  and
   displaced persons returned home during the year.
   There were frequent reports of abuses committed against  IDPs,  including
   rapes, beatings, and  attempts  by  the  Government  to  forcibly  return
   persons to their homes. The Government forcibly emptied some  IDP  camps;
   for example, on November 2, the Government closed two camps (Al Jeer  and
   Otash), using tear gas to drive IDPs out. The Government stated  that  it
   merely was moving IDPs to newer, better camps. There also  were  numerous
   credible reports that government troops harassed IDPs or  denied  persons
   access to camps. On August 3, police reportedly removed 50 newly  arrived
   men from Kalma camp. On August 5, 48  students  who  attempted  to  enter
   Kalma camp were arrested, detained, and then  released.  ...In  December,
   the Government publicly committed itself to the  principle  of  voluntary
   relocation of IDPs in  cooperation  with  the  U.N.  and  NGOs,  and  the
   International  Organization  for  Migration  reported  a  few   voluntary
   returns. The U.N. reported that IDPs lived in a climate of fear.
   The Government pressured IDPs to return home against their wishes. In one
   instance, foreign observers, visiting an IDP return site in Sani  Deleiba
   set up by the Government, discovered that IDPs who had been  forced  home
   and promised assistance to rebuild their homes received two  small  bowls
   of sorghum and a piece of plastic sheeting."

60. It is clear that the situation for internally displaced persons in the
   Khartoum area is far from ideal, but we remind ourselves that the
   consequences of a long civil war such as this do not themselves engage
   the Refugee Convention (Secretary of State for the Home Department v.
   Adan [1999] 1AC 293). We do not consider that the Government's stated aim
   to promote voluntary relocation of internally displaced persons offends
   against either Convention.    The Tribunal in AE had before it the expert
   evidence of Mr Peter Verney in the AE case, at paragraph 33 of that
   determination, as follows -

       33. The appellant regarded internally displaced persons as being
           given very minimal provision. The appellant accepted there was
           several hundreds of thousands of internally displaced persons in
           Khartoum. The appellant thought that the appellant might be
           identified by informer systems that operated in camps. The
           appellant said that there were reports of arrests and detention
           of students, lawyers, merchants and traders but accepted that
           the appellant did not fit into any of these categories. The
           appellant asserted that anybody from the appellant's ethnic
           background would have loyalty to the rebels imputed to them. The
           witnesses overall approach was that in effect the appellant
           would be at a relatively high risk of persecution "like others
           from African ethnic groups who are perceived to sympathise with
           rebel groups".

61. The alleged risk in the camps is to 'students, lawyers, merchants and
   traders' (none of which categories describes this appellant) and 'those
   from African ethnic groups who are perceived to sympathise with rebel
   groups'.  We consider that the Tribunal in AE gave sound reasons for
   concluding that the evidence, considered in the round, did not
   demonstrate a risk to a category as broad as 'those from African ethnic
   groups' without the rider of perceived rebel sympathies. We have taken
   account of the guidance given in AE, and of our duty to consider the
   facts on a case-by-case basis.  We find that the country situation on the
   material before us is that for those from Darfur, there is, and remains,
   no general risk on return (see AE).  Nor is there any general risk to
   persons returning to internally displaced persons' camps, unless they
   fall into the categories of students, lawyers, merchants, traders, or
   possibly those with known or perceived rebel profiles who are from
   African ethnic groups.

62. As regards persons not from Darfur, there is no evidence before us that
   satisfies us to the lower standard that there is a risk on return at all,
   although we accept that conditions in Khartoum for those who have to use
   the refugee camps are far from perfect. The country background evidence
   is that it is mostly those from the South and West who are in the camps.
   The US State Department Report (which was not considered in AE and
   therefore must be considered by this Tribunal on the principles set out
   in E and R [2004] EWCA Civ 49) is vague on the alleged problems of
   internally displaced persons in the camps.  The observations therein,
   which we are aware are being widely relied upon in attempts to
   distinguish AE, are imprecise and certainly insufficient to establish a
   risk to persons with no political profile or Darfurian origin, such as
   this appellant.

63. We turn therefore to the facts of the present case. The present
   appellant is not Darfurian. He is not a student, a lawyer, a merchant, or
   a trader.   The appellant is of African rather than Arab ethnicity, but
   he comes not from Darfur but from Eastern Sudan.  We consider that he
   could return there and resume his life with his wife and enlarged family.
    However, given the difficulties elsewhere in the country and his wife's
   state of health, it may be that he considers the journey too difficult or
   that it is otherwise unreasonable to expect him to return to his home
   area (Robinson [1998] QB 929).  If that is the case, we find that he
   could relocate to the Khartoum area, as it appears that he has an uncle
   in Sudan who could help him resettle, and therefore, this appellant would
   not necessarily be obliged to live in an internally displaced person
   camp.

64. The burden of proof, at the lower standard, remains on the appellant to
   show a real risk or reasonable degree of likelihood of persecution or
   treatment contrary to Article 2 or 3 of the ECHR if returned, not to his
   area of origin but his country of origin; this appellant simply has not
   discharged that burden.  The appellant has not established to that
   standard that a man of his ethnicity, returning via Khartoum with his
   wife and young family and no political profile, would be at risk of
   persecution or treatment contrary to Article 2 or 3 of the ECHR in his
   home area, nor, particularly, in Khartoum or the surrounding areas.

65. As regards the Article 8 claim, the appellant's time in the United
   Kingdom has been short.  The appellant's children are too young to be in
   school, the appellant has no job here and no unusually strong connection
   with the United Kingdom.  His connection is with his family members; his
   wife currently has no separate status in the United Kingdom and can
   return with him and the children when he is removed.     The Secretary of
   State's decision is not based upon any disclosure of the appellant's
   family circumstances and evinces no disrespect for his private and family
   life, and certainly not at the level which could engage Article 8 on a
   foreign basis (Razgar [2004] UKHL 27).  There is nothing 'truly
   exceptional' (Huang) about the situation of this appellant and his
   family, even having regard to the birth of two children and his wife's
   current post-partum ill health (for which we have no medical report).

66. We note that the Article 8 issue remains open for any application that
   the appellant's wife may make under the Refugee Convention or ECHR in her
   own right, but it was not suggested before our Tribunal that she would
   seek to remain in the United Kingdom alone. Quite the contrary; the
   appellant's wife joined him here and wishes to be considered the
   appellant's dependant.  The case was argued by Mr Quee on the basis that
   they would all return together to Sudan.

67. The Immigration Appeal Tribunal remittal is treated as a decision that
   the first Adjudicator made a material error of law.  Our task pursuant to
   rule 31(3) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005,
   is to substitute a fresh decision to allow or dismiss the appeal.  We
   have taken into account all submissions and evidence before us, together
   with the s.8 points referred to above, and our substituted decision is
   that the appellant has not discharged the burden of proof upon him at the
   appropriate lower standard in relation either to the asylum or the human
   rights claims argued before us.

   DECISION

   We find that the original Tribunal made a material error of law and we
   substitute the following decision -

      (i)   The appeal is dismissed on asylum grounds, and
      (ii)  The appeal is dismissed on human rights grounds.
