   DECISION PURSUANT TO RULE 39 OF THE TRIBUNAL PROCEDURE (UPPER TRIBUNAL)
                                 RULES 2008


 1. The appellant is a citizen of Zimbabwe. She appealed to the  First-tier
    Tribunal ("FtT) against a decision dated 14 October 2016 to refuse  her
    asylum and human rights claim. First-tier Tribunal Judge Carroll  ("the
    FtJ") dismissed her appeal on all grounds after a hearing on  17  March
    2017.

 2. Permission to appeal against  the  decision  of  the  FtJ  having  been
    granted, her appeal came before me.

 3. By consent, the parties agreed the following:

      (i)    the matters advanced in the grounds of  appeal  to  the  Upper
         Tribunal reveal material errors of law in  the  FtJ's  decision  in
         relation to the assessment of credibility; and

      (ii)   that the FtJ's decision should be set aside; and

      (iii)  that the appeal should be remitted to the First-tier  Tribunal
         for a hearing de novo before a First-tier Tribunal Judge other than
         First-tier Tribunal Judge Carroll.

4.   Having heard the parties, and  considering  rule  39  of  the  Tribunal
    Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008, I make a consent  order  in  the
    terms expressed in [3] above, considering it appropriate to do so,  and
    thus remitting the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal for a  hearing  de
    novo before a First-tier Tribunal Judge other than First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Carroll, with no findings of fact preserved.

5.   The consent order is as contained herein, no  separate  document  being
    required.







Upper Tribunal Judge Kopieczek                            19/07/17
