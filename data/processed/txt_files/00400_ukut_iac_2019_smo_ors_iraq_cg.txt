     A. INDISCRIMINATE VIOLENCE IN IRAQ: ARTICLE 15(C) OF THE  QUALIFICATION
        DIRECTIVE


     1. There continues to be an internal armed conflict in certain parts of
        Iraq, involving government forces, various militia and the  remnants
        of ISIL.  Following the military defeat of ISIL at the end  of  2017
        and the  resulting  reduction  in  levels  of  direct  and  indirect
        violence, however, the intensity of that conflict is not such  that,
        as a general matter, there are  substantial  grounds  for  believing
        that any civilian  returned  to  Iraq,  solely  on  account  of  his
        presence  there,  faces  a  real  risk   of   being   subjected   to
        indiscriminate violence amounting to serious harm within  the  scope
        of Article 15(c) QD.


     2. The only exception to the general conclusion above is in respect  of
        the small mountainous area north of Baiji in Salah al-Din, which  is
        marked on the map at Annex D.  ISIL continues to exercise  doctrinal
        control over that area and the risk of indiscriminate violence there
        is such as to engage Article 15(c) as a general matter.

     3. The situation in the Formerly Contested Areas (the  governorates  of
        Anbar,  Diyala,  Kirkuk,  Ninewah  and  Salah  Al-Din)  is  complex,
        encompassing ethnic, political and humanitarian issues which  differ
        by region.  Whether the return of an  individual  to  such  an  area
        would be  contrary  to  Article  15(c)  requires  a  fact-sensitive,
        "sliding scale"  assessment  to  which  the  following  matters  are
        relevant.

     4. Those with an actual or perceived association with ISIL  are  likely
        to be at enhanced risk throughout Iraq.  In  those  areas  in  which
        ISIL retains an active presence, those who have a  current  personal
        association with  local  or  national  government  or  the  security
        apparatus are likely to be at enhanced risk.


     5.  The  impact  of  any  of  the  personal   characteristics   listed
        immediately below must be carefully assessed against the  situation
        in the area  to  which  return  is  contemplated,  with  particular
        reference to the extent of ongoing ISIL activity and the  behaviour
        of the security  actors  in  control  of  that  area.   Within  the
        framework of such an analysis, the other  personal  characteristics
        which are capable of being relevant, individually and cumulatively,
        to the sliding scale analysis required  by  Article  15(c)  are  as
        follows:


          . Opposition to or  criticism  of  the  GOI,  the  KRG  or  local
            security actors;


          . Membership of a national, ethnic or religious  group  which  is
            either in the minority in the area in question, or  not  in  de
            facto control of that area;


          . LGBTI individuals, those not conforming to  Islamic  mores  and
            wealthy or Westernised individuals;


          . Humanitarian or medical staff and those associated with Western
            organisations or security forces;


          . Women and children without genuine family support; and


          . Individuals with disabilities.

     6. The living conditions in Iraq as a  whole,  including  the  Formerly
        Contested Areas, are unlikely to give rise to a breach of Article  3
        ECHR or  (therefore)  to  necessitate  subsidiary  protection  under
        Article 15(b) QD.  Where it is asserted that return to a  particular
        part of Iraq would give rise to such a breach, however, it is to  be
        recalled that the minimum level of severity  required  is  relative,
        according to the personal circumstances of the individual concerned.
         Any such circumstances require  individualised  assessment  in  the
        context of the conditions of the area in question.

    B.   DOCUMENTATION AND FEASIBILITY OF RETURN (EXCLUDING IKR)

     7. Return of former residents of the Iraqi Kurdish Region (IKR) will be
        to the IKR and all other  Iraqis  will  be  to  Baghdad.  The  Iraqi
        authorities will allow an Iraqi national (P) in the  United  Kingdom
        to enter Iraq only if P is in possession of  a  current  or  expired
        Iraqi passport relating to P, or a Laissez Passer.


     8. No Iraqi national will be returnable to Baghdad if not in possession
        of one of these documents.

     9. In the light of the Court of Appeal's  judgment  in  HF  (Iraq)  and
        Others v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2013] EWCA  Civ
        1276, an international protection claim made by P cannot succeed  by
        reference to any alleged risk of harm arising from an absence  of  a
        current or expired Iraqi  passport  or  a  Laissez  passer,  if  the
        Tribunal finds that P's return is not currently feasible on  account
        of a lack of any of those documents.

    10. Where P is returned to Iraq on a Laissez Passer or expired passport,
        P will be at no risk of serious harm  at  the  point  of  return  by
        reason of not having a current passport.

    C.   CIVIL STATUS IDENTITY DOCUMENTATION


    11. The CSID is being replaced  with  a  new  biometric  Iraqi  National
        Identity Card - the INID.  As a general matter, it is necessary  for
        an individual to have one of these two documents in  order  to  live
        and travel within Iraq without encountering treatment or  conditions
        which are contrary to Article 3 ECHR.   Many of the  checkpoints  in
        the country are manned by Shia militia who are not controlled by the
        GOI and are unlikely to permit an individual without a  CSID  or  an
        INID  to  pass.   A  valid  Iraqi  passport  is  not  recognised  as
        acceptable proof of identity for internal travel.


    12. A Laissez Passer will be of no assistance in the absence of  a  CSID
        or an INID; it is confiscated upon arrival and is not, in any event,
        a recognised identity document.  There is insufficient  evidence  to
        show that returnees are issued  with  a  'certification  letter'  at
        Baghdad Airport,  or  to  show  that  any  such  document  would  be
        recognised internally as acceptable proof of identity.

    13. Notwithstanding the phased  transition  to  the  INID  within  Iraq,
        replacement  CSIDs   remain   available   through   Iraqi   Consular
        facilities.   Whether  an  individual  will  be  able  to  obtain  a
        replacement CSID whilst in the UK depends on the documents available
        and, critically, the availability of the volume and  page  reference
        of the entry in the Family Book in Iraq, which system  continues  to
        underpin the Civil Status Identity process.  Given the importance of
        that  information,  most  Iraqi  citizens  will  recall   it.   That
        information may also be obtained from family members, although it is
        necessary to consider whether such relatives are on the father's  or
        the mother's side because the registration system is patrilineal.

    14. Once in Iraq, it remains the case that an individual is expected  to
        attend their local CSA office  in  order  to  obtain  a  replacement
        document.  All CSA offices have now re-opened, although  the  extent
        to which records have been destroyed by the conflict  with  ISIL  is
        unclear, and is likely to vary significantly depending on the extent
        and intensity of the conflict in the area in question.

    15. An individual returnee who is not from Baghdad is not likely  to  be
        able to obtain a  replacement  document  there,  and  certainly  not
        within a reasonable time.   Neither  the  Central  Archive  nor  the
        assistance facilities for IDPs are likely  to  render  documentation
        assistance to an undocumented returnee.

    16. The likelihood of obtaining a replacement identity document  by  the
        use of a proxy, whether from the  UK  or  on  return  to  Iraq,  has
        reduced due to the introduction of the INID  system.   In  order  to
        obtain an INID, an individual must attend their local CSA office  in
        person to enrol their biometrics, including  fingerprints  and  iris
        scans.  The CSA offices in which INID terminals have been  installed
        are unlikely - as a result of the phased  replacement  of  the  CSID
        system - to issue a CSID, whether to an individual in person or to a
        proxy.   The reducing number of CSA offices in which INID  terminals
        have not been installed will continue to issue CSIDs to  individuals
        and their proxies upon production of the necessary information.

    D.   INTERNAL RELOCATION WITHIN GOI-CONTROLLED IRAQ

    17. Where internal relocation is raised in  the  Iraqi  context,  it  is
        necessary to consider not only  the  safety  and  reasonableness  of
        relocation but also the feasibility of  that  course,  in  light  of
        sponsorship and residency requirements in operation in various parts
        of the country.  Individuals who seek to relocate within the country
        may not be admitted  to  a  potential  safe  haven  or  may  not  be
        permitted to remain there.


    18. Relocation within the Formerly Contested Areas.  With the  exception
        of the small area identified in section A,  the  general  conditions
        within the Formerly Contested Areas do not engage Article  15  QD(b)
        or (c)  or  Article  3  ECHR  and  relocation  within  the  Formerly
        Contested Areas may obviate a risk which exists in  an  individual's
        home area.  Where relocation within the Formerly Contested Areas  is
        under contemplation, however, the ethnic and  political  composition
        of the home area and the place of relocation  will  be  particularly
        relevant.  In particular, an individual who lived in a  former  ISIL
        stronghold for some time may fall under  suspicion  in  a  place  of
        relocation.   Tribal  and  ethnic  differences  may  preclude   such
        relocation, given the significant presence and  control  of  largely
        Shia militia  in  these  areas.   Even  where  it  is  safe  for  an
        individual to relocate within the Formerly Contested Areas, however,
        it is unlikely to be either feasible or reasonable without  a  prior
        connection to, and a support structure within, the area in question.


    19. Relocation to Baghdad.   Baghdad  is  generally  safe  for  ordinary
        civilians but whether it is safe for  a  particular  returnee  is  a
        question of fact in the individual  case.   There  are  no  on-entry
        sponsorship requirements  for  Baghdad  but  there  are  sponsorship
        requirements for residency.  A documented individual of working  age
        is likely to be able to satisfy those requirements.   Relocation  to
        Baghdad is likely to be reasonable for Arab Shia and  Sunni  single,
        able-bodied men and married couples of working age without  children
        and without specific vulnerabilities.  Other individuals are  likely
        to require external support, ie a support network of members of  his
        or her family, extended family or tribe, who are willing and able to
        provide  genuine  support.   Whether  such  a  support  network   is
        available is to be considered with  reference  to  the  collectivist
        nature of Iraqi society, as considered in AAH (Iraq).

    E.   IRAQI KURDISH REGION

    20. There are regular direct flights from the UK to  the  Iraqi  Kurdish
        Region and returns might be to Baghdad or to that region.  It is for
        the respondent to state whether she intends to  remove  to  Baghdad,
        Erbil or Sulaymaniyah.


    Kurds
    21. For an Iraqi national returnee (P) of Kurdish origin  in  possession
        of a valid CSID or Iraqi National Identity Card (INID), the  journey
        from Baghdad to the IKR by land is affordable and practical and  can
        be made without a real risk  of  P  suffering  persecution,  serious
        harm, or Article 3 ill treatment nor would any difficulties  on  the
        journey make relocation unduly harsh.

    22. P is unable to board a domestic flight between Baghdad and  the  IKR
        without either a CSID, an INID or a valid passport.  If P has one of
        those documents, the journey from Baghdad to  the  IKR  by  land  is
        affordable and practical and can be made without a real  risk  of  P
        suffering persecution, serious harm, or Article 3 ill treatment  nor
        would any difficulties on the journey make relocation unduly harsh.

    23. P will face considerable difficulty in making  the  journey  between
        Baghdad and the IKR by land without a CSID or  an  INID.  There  are
        numerous checkpoints en route,  including  two  checkpoints  in  the
        immediate vicinity of the airport.  If P has neither a CSID  nor  an
        INID there is a real risk of P being detained at a checkpoint  until
        such time as the security personnel are able to verify P's identity.
         It is not reasonable to require P to travel between Baghdad and IKR
        by land absent the  ability  of  P  to  verify  his  identity  at  a
        checkpoint. This normally requires the attendance of a  male  family
        member and production of P's identity  documents  but  may  also  be
        achieved by calling upon "connections" higher up  in  the  chain  of
        command.

    24. Once at the IKR border (land or air) P  would  normally  be  granted
        entry  to  the  territory.  Subject  to  security   screening,   and
        registering presence with the local mukhtar, P would be permitted to
        enter and reside in the IKR with no  further  legal  impediments  or
        requirements. There are no sponsorship  requirements  for  entry  or
        residence in any of the three IKR Governorates for Kurds.

    25. Whether P would be at particular risk of  ill-treatment  during  the
        security screening process must be assessed on a case-by-case basis.
        Additional factors that may increase risk include: (i) coming from a
        family with a known association with ISIL, (ii) coming from an  area
        associated with ISIL and (iii) being a single male of fighting  age.
        P is likely to be able to evidence the fact of recent  arrival  from
        the UK, which would dispel any suggestion of having arrived directly
        from ISIL territory.

    26. If P has family members living  in  the  IKR  cultural  norms  would
        require that family to accommodate P. In such circumstances P would,
        in general, have sufficient assistance from the family so as to lead
        a 'relatively normal life', which would not be unduly harsh.  It  is
        nevertheless important for decision-makers to determine  the  extent
        of any assistance likely to be provided by P's family on a  case  by
        case basis.

    27.  For  Kurds  without  the  assistance  of  family  in  the  IKR  the
        accommodation options are limited:

        i) Absent special circumstances it is not reasonably likely that  P
           will be able to gain access to one of the refugee camps  in  the
           IKR; these camps  are  already  extremely  overcrowded  and  are
           closed to newcomers. 64% of IDPs  are  accommodated  in  private
           settings with the vast majority living with family members;


       ii) If P cannot live with a family member, apartments  in  a  modern
           block in a new neighbourhood are available for rent at a cost of
           between $300 and $400 per month;


      iii) P could resort to a 'critical shelter arrangement', living in an
           unfinished or  abandoned  structure,  makeshift  shelter,  tent,
           mosque, church or squatting in a government building.  It  would
           be unduly harsh to require P to relocate to the IKR  if  P  will
           live in a critical  housing  shelter  without  access  to  basic
           necessities such as food, clean water and clothing;

       iv)  In  considering  whether  P  would  be  able  to  access  basic
           necessities, account must be  taken  of  the  fact  that  failed
           asylum seekers are entitled to  apply  for  a  grant  under  the
           Voluntary Returns Scheme, which could give P  access  to  �1500.
           Consideration should also be  given  to  whether  P  can  obtain
           financial support from other sources such as (a) employment, (b)
           remittances from relatives abroad, (c) the  availability  of  ad
           hoc charity or by being able to access PDS rations.

    28. Whether P is able to secure employment must be assessed on a case-by-
        case basis taking the following matters into account:


        i) Gender. Lone women are  very  unlikely  to  be  able  to  secure
           legitimate employment;


       ii) The unemployment rate for Iraqi IDPs living in the IKR is 70%;


      iii) P cannot work without a CSID or INID;

       iv) Patronage and nepotism  continue  to  be  important  factors  in
           securing employment. A returnee with family connections  to  the
           region will have  a  significant  advantage  in  that  he  would
           ordinarily  be  able  to  call  upon  those  contacts  to   make
           introductions to prospective employers and to vouch for him;

        v) Skills, education and experience. Unskilled workers are  at  the
           greatest disadvantage, with  the  decline  in  the  construction
           industry reducing the number of labouring jobs available;

       vi) If P is from an area with a marked association with  ISIL,  that
           may deter prospective employers.

    Non-Kurdish Returnees
    29. The ability of non-Kurdish returnees to relocate to the IKR is to be
        distinguished.  There are no sponsorship requirements for  entry  or
        residence in  Erbil  and  Sulaymaniyah,  although  single  Arab  and
        Turkmen citizens require  regular  employment  in  order  to  secure
        residency.  Arabs from former conflict areas and  Turkmen  from  Tal
        Afar are subject to sponsorship requirements to enter or  reside  in
        Dohuk. Although Erbil  and  Sulaymaniyah  are  accessible  for  such
        individuals, particular care must be  taken  in  evaluating  whether
        internal relocation to the IKR for a non-Kurd would  be  reasonable.
        Given the  economic  and  humanitarian  conditions  in  the  IKR  at
        present, an Arab with no viable support network in the IKR is likely
        to experience unduly harsh conditions upon relocation there.

 2. The first appellant was born on 1 September 1989. He entered the United
    Kingdom on 22 March 2016 and claimed asylum.   He  is  from  a  village
    called Albu Mohammed in the Daquq District of Kirkuk Governorate.   His
    account of having been targeted by ISIL and of having lost contact with
    his family in Iraq was rejected by the First-tier  Tribunal.   The  FtT
    found that his family remained in the family home.  The FtT  held  that
    there had been a  significant  change  in  circumstances  in  Iraq  and
    departed from AA (Iraq), concluding that the appellant could return  to
    his home area in safety.  That conclusion was held  by  Upper  Tribunal
    Judge O'Connor to be erroneous in law  and  was  set  aside,  with  the
    primary findings of fact made by the judge at first instance  otherwise
    preserved.

 3. The second appellant was born on  1  November  1989.   He  entered  the
    United Kingdom on 28 November 2005 and claimed asylum.  He is from  Tuz
    Khurmato,  the  main  city  of  the  Duz  District  in  Salah  al   Din
    Governorate.  His appeal against the respondent's refusal of his asylum
    claim was dismissed by the FtT,  which  rejected  all  aspects  of  his
    account other than his claim to have run a barbershop in Tuz  Khurmato.
    The FtT found that there had been a significant change  in  Iraq  since
    the last country guidance decision and that KSP would not be at risk on
    return to Salah al Din.  On appeal, the latter aspect of  the  decision
    was deemed by Upper Tribunal Judge Rintoul to be unsustainable  because
    the FtT had failed to  adopt  the  correct  approach  to  the  existing
    country guidance.  Judge Rintoul directed that the decision  should  be
    remade in the Upper Tribunal, based on the findings of fact made by the
    FtT.


 4. The third appellant was born on 25 May 1987 and is from Mosul in Ninewa
    Governorate.  He entered the United Kingdom  on  5  October  2000  and,
    although his claim for asylum was refused, he was  granted  Exceptional
    Leave to Remain (as an Unaccompanied Asylum  Seeking  Child)  until  18
    July 2005.  He was granted Indefinite Leave to Remain on 11 March 2001.
     He committed offences in the United Kingdom, as a result of which  the
    respondent sought to deport him.  His appeal against that decision  was
    dismissed by the FtT which found, amongst other things, that  he  could
    relocate to Baghdad.  Permission to appeal was refused by the  FtT  and
    the  Upper  Tribunal  and  a  "Cart"  JR  was  initially  unsuccessful.
    Permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal was granted,  however,  and
    the respondent agreed that the appeal should be allowed and remitted to
    the Upper Tribunal.  Following a hearing in the Upper Tribunal, it  was
    ordered  that  the  decision  on  the  appeal  should  be  remade   (on
    Humanitarian Protection and Article 3 ECHR grounds) on the basis of the
    FtT's findings of fact.  Those findings included an acceptance that the
    appellant lacked the requisite  documents  to  obtain  a  Civil  Status
    Identity Document ("CSID") in the UK or Iraq and that he had no  family
    or friends in Baghdad who could accommodate him.


 5. The hearing of these  appeals  was  due  to  take  place  in  the  week
    commencing 24 June 2019.  On 21 June, the respondent informed the third
    appellant's representatives  that  she  intended  to  grant  the  third
    appellant leave to remain.  This was because it  was  accepted  by  the
    respondent that the findings we have summarised above would  give  rise
    to a breach of Article 3 ECHR upon  the  third  appellant's  return  to
    Iraq.  Mr Thomann confirmed at the outset of the hearing, and  at  [20]
    of his closing written submissions, that this was the basis upon  which
    the appellant was to be granted leave to remain.

 6. It was not submitted by the respondent at the hearing  that  the  third
    appellant's appeal fell to be treated as abandoned pursuant to  section
    104(4A) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  Nor could
    such a submission  have  been  made;  the  appellant's  appeal  remains
    pending until he  is  formally  granted  leave  to  remain.   Were  the
    appellant to be granted limited  leave  on  that  basis,  he  would  be
    entitled  to  elect  to  continue  with  the  appeal  (on  humanitarian
    protection  grounds)  under  section  104(4B)   of   the   Nationality,
    Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002.   Mr  Bazini  indicated  that  the
    appellant would so elect in the event that he was granted leave  whilst
    the appeal was pending.  We indicated that we would value the input  of
    Mr Bazini and Mr Cole in any event.  As we have recorded, each  of  the
    appellants is from a different part of the formerly contested areas and
    the third appellant is from Mosul, which is Iraq's  second  city.   The
    submissions to be made on  behalf  of  the  third  appellant  therefore
    concerned a significant part of the intended Country Guidance.  In  the
    circumstances, Mr Bazini and Mr Cole remained throughout  the  hearing.
    As we record below, Mr Bazini not  only  responded  at  length  to  the
    closing submissions made by Mr Thomann; he also asked questions of  the
    expert witness (Dr Fatah) in chief and in  re-examination.   We  valued
    his assistance.  We were notified after  the  hearing  that  the  third
    appellant had been granted leave to remain.  As anticipated, he elected
    to  continue  with  his  appeal  on  humanitarian  protection   grounds
    nevertheless.  We gave an indication in writing that the  appeal  would
    remain before us on that basis.

The Current Country Guidance
 7. There are three  extant  Country  Guidance  decisions  about  Iraq:  AA
    (Article 15(c)) Iraq CG [2015] UKUT 544 (IAC); BA (Returns to  Baghdad)
    Iraq CG  [2017]  UKUT  18  (IAC);  and  AAH  (Iraqi  Kurds  -  internal
    relocation) Iraq CG [2018] UKUT 212 (IAC).


 8. In AA (Iraq), it was conceded by the respondent that a civilian with no
    distinguishing characteristics would, simply by virtue of his  presence
    in one of the contested  areas  (the  governorates  of  Anbar,  Diyala,
    Kirkuk, Ninewa and Salah al Din) be at real risk of  suffering  serious
    harm of the type identified in Article 15(c) of the  Council  Directive
    2004/83/EC (the Qualification Directive).  For the reasons it  gave  at
    [101]-[106], the Upper Tribunal had no  hesitation  in  endorsing  that
    concession, noting that life in those areas (which were  controlled  at
    the time by ISIL) was characterised by systematic and  widespread  acts
    of violence and gross violations of international humanitarian law  and
    abuses of human rights. The Upper Tribunal also concluded that  certain
    parts of the so-called Baghdad Belts were affected by an internal armed
    conflict of such intensity that there was a generalised  Article  15(c)
    risk there.  It was not accepted that the remainder of Iraq,  including
    Baghdad City, was affected by such a level of internal armed conflict.

 9. Guidance was also given in AA (Iraq) on relocation within Iraq and  the
    Kurdistan  Region  of  Iraq  ("KRI",  also  known  as  the  IKR);   the
    feasibility of return to Iraq; and the position on documentation  where
    return to Iraq is feasible.  The appellant appealed  to  the  Court  of
    Appeal and it was accepted by the respondent that  the  Upper  Tribunal
    had erred in its approach to the latter two issues and that the correct
    course was for the Court of Appeal to amend the Country Guidance so  as
    to correct it.  The amended guidance was appended to  the  judgment  of
    the court: [2017] EWCA Civ 944; [2018] 1 WLR 1083.

10. In AAH (Iraq), the Upper Tribunal revisited that guidance to a  limited
    extent.  As noted at [1]-[2] of that decision, the principal  focus  of
    that case was whether Iraqi Kurds could relocate to the IKR.  The Upper
    Tribunal stated that it was  not  concerned  to  consider  whether  the
    guidance given in AA (Iraq) in respect of Article 15(c) held good,  and
    the appeal had proceeded on the assumption that  it  did.   Instead  of
    issuing additional guidance, the Upper Tribunal simply amended sections
    C and E of the guidance given in AA (Iraq).  The AA (Iraq) guidance, as
    amended by the Court of Appeal  and  supplemented  in  AAH  (Iraq),  is
    reproduced at Annex A to this decision.

11. In BA (Iraq), the Upper  Tribunal's  original  intention  was  to  give
    guidance on the risk to those perceived as having collaborated with the
    West: [8] and [12].  At the outset of the hearing, the  Upper  Tribunal
    expressed some concern about the suitability of the case as  a  vehicle
    for guidance but, having heard argument from both  representatives,  it
    agreed that it would provide guidance because the decision "may  assist
    a wider readership in so far as the Tribunal  sets  out  a  summary  of
    recent evidence relating to the situation in Baghdad regarding a number
    of potential risk factors, albeit that it  is  accepted  that  none  of
    those factors, taken alone, are sufficient to  found  a  claim  at  the
    current time": [15].  The Upper Tribunal  proceeded  to  give  guidance
    which included a conclusion that the level of violence in Baghdad  City
    remained significant but did not justify departing from the guidance in
    AA (Iraq).  We have reproduced the guidance in full at Annex B of  this
    decision.  As submitted at [20] of the  appellants'  combined  skeleton
    argument,  BA  (Iraq)  essentially  provides  supplementary   guidance,
    alongside the main framework which has been amended since 2015.

Scope
12. We have set out the facts of the appellants' cases and the state of the
    current guidance at some length in order to explain  and  contextualise
    the scope of  our  task.   In  each  of  the  appeals  before  us,  the
    appellant's  claim  under  the  Refugee  Convention  has  been  finally
    determined.  It would not be appropriate, in  those  circumstances,  to
    embark upon a general consideration of risk categories  in  Iraq  under
    that Convention.  Although the first  and  second  appellants'  written
    submissions seemed on occasion to range into that territory, Mr Knafler
    accepted orally that no issues under the 1951 Convention  arose  before
    us.  He clarified that the risk categories relied upon in  the  written
    submissions were relevant to the "sliding  scale" question  of  whether
    an  individual  with   particular   characteristics   might   be   more
    specifically affected by indiscriminate violence under Article 15(c) of
    the Qualification Directive: Elgafaji v Staatssecretaris  van  Jutsitie
    (C-465/07); [2009] 2 CMLR 45 refers, at [39].

13. In light of the above, the issues which arise in these  appeals  are  as
   follows:

      i) Whether  there  are  substantial  grounds  for  believing  that  an
         individual returned to Baghdad  or  a  formerly  contested  area[1]
         would face a real risk of being subject to indiscriminate  violence
         amounting to serious harm within the scope of Article 15(c).


     ii) Whether the general humanitarian situation in those areas  is  such
         that an individual, if returned,  would  suffer  harm  contrary  to
         Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights (and therefore
         conditions contrary to Article 15(b) QD) if returned.


    iii) Whether that risk, if found to exist, can be  avoided  by  internal
         relocation.


     iv) Whether amendments need to be made to the Tribunal's extant country
         guidance in respect of the circumstances in which  a  Civil  Status
         Identity Document may be obtained and/or is required to  travel  in
         Iraq.


                       SECTION B - BACKGROUND MATERIAL

14.  Substantial  amounts  of  background  material  were  adduced  by  the
    appellants, including recent  reports  from  the  UNHCR,  the  European
    Asylum Support Office[2] and a letter from Amnesty International  which
    was written specifically in connection with the fourth of the questions
    set out above.  For her part, the respondent  adduced  statements  from
    officials, documents exhibited to those statements and  Country  Policy
    and Information Notes.  Mr Thomann, Mr Knafler and Mr Bazini also  made
    reference to the opinions of various commentators  on  Iraq,  including
    Joel Wing, the author of  an  established  and  reputable  blog  called
    Musings on Iraq and Michael Knights, Senior Fellow  of  the  Washington
    Institute for Near  East  Policy.   As  in  AAH  (Iraq),  however,  the
    principal evidence to which counsel referred came from Dr Rebwar Fatah.



Overview of Dr Fatah's Evidence
15. Dr Fatah is, as the Upper Tribunal noted at [7]  of  AAH  (Iraq),  well
    known to this Tribunal.  He is a British citizen who was  born  in  the
    IKR.  His  academic  qualifications  including  his  doctorate  are  in
    Physics.  He worked for a variety of private companies in the UK before
    setting up Middle East Consultancy Services in 2000.  His expertise  is
    in the Middle East and North Africa and he describes himself as a 'MENA
    specialist'.  He speaks Kurdish  Sorani  and  Arabic  and  is  able  to
    converse in Farsi, Pashto and Dari also.  As an expert on  the  region,
    he  undertakes  three  main  types  of  work:  expert  reports  on  the
    background  situation;   document   authentication;   and   nationality
    assessments.  Since  2000,  he  has  produced  more  than  2000  expert
    reports, which  have  been  relied  upon  in  immigration,  family  and
    criminal proceedings.  As well as providing reports in various  country
    guidance appeals, Dr Fatah has been commissioned to undertake  projects
    for organisations such  as  UNHCR  and  the  International  Office  for
    Migration. He travels regularly to  Iraq,  and  was  most  recently  in
    Sulaymaniyah in October 2018.  He has spoken publicly  in  the  UK  and
    abroad about the Iraq and the region as a whole.

16. In AAH  (Iraq),  Dr  Fatah's  evidence  was  described  as  insightful,
    helpful,  measured  and  well-sourced.   Both  counsel  in  that   case
    submitted that he was an excellent expert.   Similar  submissions  were
    made  before  us  and  we  have  no  hesitation  in   endorsing   those
    submissions.  The depth and breadth of his knowledge on Iraq is readily
    apparent, as was his desire to remain absolutely impartial.  He refused
    to be drawn into speculation, preferring always to justify his  opinion
    with reference to an identifiable source.  We were impressed  with  his
    reports and with his oral evidence and have been  greatly  assisted  by
    him.

17. Dr Fatah's main report was completed on 22 March 2019.  It runs to 1055
    paragraphs, spanning 166 pages of single-spaced  type.   He  stated  in
    oral evidence that it is the lengthiest report he has ever produced.

18. Having set out his credentials, his instructions and the facts  of  the
    individual cases, Dr Fatah turns to explaining the division of  control
    in certain parts of Iraq.  With reference to  the  map  which  we  have
    reproduced at Annex C, Dr Fatah identifies  the  Disputed  Territories,
    which include parts of the governorates of Ninewa, Kirkuk, Salah al Din
    and Diyala.  He explains that the Kurdish Regional  Government  ("KRG")
    gained autonomy in 1991 and governed the Dohuk, Erbil and  Sulaymaniyah
    governorates.  Saddam Hussein was removed in 2003, after which the  KRG
    gained some de facto control over parts of  the  Disputed  Territories.
    When ISIL began  to  expand  across  the  region  in  2014,  the  Iraqi
    government forces fell back, thereby enabling yet further expansion  by
    the KRG authorities into the Disputed Territories.  In September  2017,
    the KRG authorities held an Independence Referendum, despite  the  lack
    of international support for such a move.  In  the  aftermath  of  that
    referendum, the Prime  Minister  of  Iraq  ordered  that  much  of  the
    Disputed Territories should be reclaimed form  Kurdish  forces.   There
    were some clashes, particularly  around  Kirkuk,  but  the  KRG  forces
    eventually withdrew and  were  effectively  pushed  back  to  the  1991
    borders.

19. Dr Fatah considers the dysfunctional nature of the political  situation
    in the IKR and explains that the relationship  between  the  autonomous
    region and the Government of Iraq ("GOI") has deteriorated as a  result
    of the referendum.   Religious  fundamentalism  has  increased  in  the
    region and the  rift  between  the  two  main  political  parties  (the
    Patriotic Union of Kurdistan and the Kurdistan  Democratic  Party)  has
    worsened.  The KRG and the GOI remain locked in disagreement  over  the
    Disputed Territories, and about Kirkuk in  particular.   Disputes  over
    the right to export oil  from  the  IKR  only  serve  to  increase  the
    tension.  Iraq itself held elections in May 2018 and  Adil  Abdul-Mahdi
    became Prime Minister, although his position is a difficult one,  since
    it was only earned by consent from all political blocs.   The  security
    situation is complicated by the presence of Shia militia known  as  the
    Popular Mobilisation Forces or Units ("PMF" or "PMU") in  the  country.
    The most powerful of these militias have ties to Iran and  whilst  they
    have technically been under Baghdad's control since 2016,  they  answer
    to their Iranian sponsors.  Dr Fatah opines that the current  level  of
    insecurity  in  Iraq  is  rooted  in  a   number   of   socio-political
    circumstances.  He identifies sectarian and tribal divisions,  poverty,
    the loss of command and structure in  the  army,  ISIL  cooperation  by
    politicians and the role of force in political legitimacy.

20. Sections 8 and 9 of Dr Fatah's report consider the security  situations
    in the IKR and Disputed Territories and  the  part  of  Iraq  which  is
    controlled by the Government of Iraq ("GOI") respectively.  Dr  Fatah's
    own summaries of those sections are as follows:

   Section 8 - The IKR and Disputed Territories
         [443] The objective evidence provides that  the  IKR  and  Disputed
         Territories are unstable due to recent political developments. This
         will affect issues of relocation to the region.  Usually,  the  IKR
         hardly ever experiences violent attacks.  Security  incidences  are
         notable because of  their  rarity  in  the  IKR.  However,  growing
         tensions between the Gol and  IKR  have  resulted  in  an  unstable
         situation.  Moreover, there was a notable terror attack in Erbil in
         July 2018. The general profile of those that are at risk/ have been
         targeted  within  the  IKR  include  persons  residing  within  PKK
         majority areas due to indiscriminate  Turkish  bombings.  Moreover,
         those that protest against the KRG have been forcibly dispersed and
         sometimes killed.


         [444] The Disputed Territories are - and have been,  since  2003  -
         the  most  unstable.  These  are  the  provinces  in  which  Iraq's
         different  religions,  ethnic  groups  and   political   ideologies
         collide. This is where the vast majority of those casualties listed
         above take place.


         [445] The current situation in Salahuddin[3] is  volatile.  In  Tuz
         Khurmato, displacement and civilian casualties are occurring due to
         conflict between the "White Flags" group,  the  Kurdish  Liberation
         Army, and PMU forces; whereas ISIS  sleeper  cells  have  organised
         attacks in Tikrit. According to Michael Knights, a senior fellow at
         the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, Tuz Khurmato is "the
         most violent, most divided place in the country" due to their being
         "so many layers of conflict". The situation in Tuz is considered to
         be very unstable due to the presence of  various  armed  groups  in
         addition to ethno-sectarian violence.  As  with  elsewhere  in  the
         Disputed Territories, civilians are at some risk of  indiscriminate
         attacks by insurgent groups.  Security forces and  village  chiefs,
         or mukhtars, are at risk of  targeting  by  ISIS  and  other  armed
         groups. There have also been reported kidnappings by  Shia  militia
         groups, and Iranian pilgrims have also faced targeting here.


         [446] While the majority of recorded attacks in Kirkuk  governorate
         following the referendum appeared to be insurgent attacks targeting
         military personnel,  there  has  been  an  increase  in  documented
         civilian attacks there. Moreover, ISIS has  regained  territory  on
         the Kirkuk / Salahadin border. Based  on  the  objective  evidence,
         civilians in Kirkuk face some risk of indiscriminate  targeting  by
         insurgent groups. A number  of  reported  incidents  documents  the
         killing and wounding of civilians here by planted explosives.  Such
         groups also target both Gol and KRG security  forces,  particularly
         at checkpoints.  Insurgent  groups  in  the  area  have  also  been
         reported to abduct minorities, including Kakais.


         [447] It is plausible to assume that the targeting of  the  Asayish
         member and the instance of a Kurdish man being shot at by a passing
         car indicates tribal activity.


         [448] Ninewa, a disputed and formerly-contested area, is considered
         to have a very high level  of  security  incidents.  Based  on  the
         objective evidence provided below, civilians face a level  of  risk
         of indiscriminate attacks by insurgent groups. While ISIS is  still
         present in the  region  via  sleeper  cells,  security  forces  are
         particularly targeted by this group.


         [449] Diyala too has a very high level of security incidents. While
         in December it was reported that only sporadic ISIS  cells  remain,
         recorded attacks constitute a threat to civilians living there. Due
         to indiscriminate targeting by insurgent groups, it  is  considered
         that all citizens here face some level of risk. The security forces
         are  also  largely  targeted  by  such  groups,   particularly   at
         checkpoints. The objective evidence also demonstrates the targeting
         of  a  judge,  Turkoman  politicians  and   their   families,   and
         foreigners. Moreover, the targeted death of Kurdish  citizens  here
         may indicate tribal forces.


         [450] Generally, in areas where militant groups continue to pose  a
         risk,  particularly  in  Kirkuk,  Salahadin,  Anbar,  and   Ninewa,
         individuals who are authority figures, such as security  personnel,
         mukhtars, and  volunteers  who  fought  against  ISIS  may  face  a
         targeted risk. Regular civilians face some general risk.  In  areas
         where militants pose a more sporadic threat, civilians may  face  a
         greater general risk, but a lower targeted one.


         Section 9 - Iraq Proper
         [541]  Going  back  to  late-2013  southern  provinces  have  often
         experienced weeks or months between reported incidents and conflict-
         related casualties. In the beginning of  January  2016,  there  was
         some increase in the levels of violence  as  security  forces  that
         have been redeployed in the fight against ISIS has  resulted  in  a
         security vacuum in some  parts  of  the  South  of  Iraq.  Security
         incidences in comparison to the rest of  Iraq  is  relatively  low,
         however the existence of ISIS  sleeper  cells,  Shia  militia,  and
         tribal disputes demonstrate an existing level of potential risk for
         those that live there.


         [542] It is the third area of the country (Baghdad, Anbar  and  the
         'Disputed Territories') that are - and have been, since 2003 -  the
         most unstable. These are the provinces in  which  Iraq's  different
         religions, ethnic groups and political ideologies collide. This  is
         where the vast majority  of  those  casualties  listed  above  take
         place.


         [543] In 2017, Baghdad recorded  the  highest  number  of  security
         incidences across the country and until the start of  the  military
         offensive in Ninewa, Baghdad was continuously  the  worst  affected
         governorate. In recent months, registering  dozens  of  causalities
         every month. ISIS has stepped up its bombing campaigns as it  seeks
         to reassert power while the group loses control of large swathes of
         territory it once held. The ISF have been  incompetent  in  foiling
         large-scale attacks and protecting civilians.


         [544] Following the liberation of  Iraqi  population  centres  from
         ISIS rule, ISIS has been relegated to parts of the desert in  Anbar
         along the border with Syria. While this means that citizens are  no
         longer living under ISIS, it does not mean that the threat has been
         removed entirely, as sleeper cells may continue to pose a threat in
         various parts of the country. Other than ISIS,  there  are  further
         security issues remaining in Iraq, particularly the ongoing tension
         between the federal Iraqi  authorities  and  the  Kurdish  regional
         government, which has already led to clashes between the  Peshmerga
         and the ISF and its associated Shia militias and  the  displacement
         of thousands from the Disputed Territories. Shia militias are  also
         reported to have committed atrocities within many of these disputed
         areas. Reprisals against Sunnis from formerly ISIS-controlled areas
         and the continuous persecution of ethnic and  religious  minorities
         also remain a concern.


         [545]  Today  the  level  of  security  incidences   and   civilian
         casualties remain high.

21. Section 10 of Dr  Fatah's  report  describes  the  composition  of  the
    various security forces in Iraq, including the PMF, the  Peshmerga  and
    the Iraqi Security  Forces  (ISF).   Section  11  is  devoted  to  risk
    profiles in GOI-controlled Iraq and section 12 to risk profiles in  the
    Disputed Territories.  We will consider below the extent to which these
    risk profiles are relevant to the sliding scale assessment required  by
    Elgafaji.  Sections 13 to 16 consider the  influence  of  international
    actors with Iraq.  In section 17, Dr Fatah reiterates evidence  he  has
    given previously about the need for a CSID in order to travel in  Iraq.
    He updates that  evidence,  with  particular  reference  to  the  Iraqi
    National ID card ("INID"), and responds to  the  respondent's  evidence
    that an individual can use other documents, including a Laissez  Passer
    or a 'Certification Letter' in order to travel internally.  Section  18
    considers the  possibility  of  internal  relocation  within  Iraq  and
    section 19 contains Dr Fatah's overall conclusions.

22. The respondent asked 32 written questions of Dr Fatah.  He prepared  an
    additional report on 18 April 2019, containing  responses  to  each  of
    these questions.  On 21 June 2019,  days  before  the  hearing  of  the
    appeals, he prepared an updating report which was  handed  up  (without
    objection from Mr Thomann) on the first morning of  the  hearing.   The
    report takes the form  of  an  update  on  the  security  situation  in
    Makhmour, Anbar, Hawija and the IKR as a whole.

23. We heard from Dr Fatah on the first and  second  day  of  the  hearing.
    Having confirmed the accuracy of his reports, he  was  examined  by  Mr
    Knafler and Mr Bazini before being cross-examined by  Mr  Thomann.   Mr
    Knafler and Mr Bazini each had a few questions in re-examination before
    we asked several  questions  of  our  own,  from  which  counsel  asked
    questions arising.

24. We turn in the next part of this judgment to provide  a  more  detailed
    summary of Dr Fatah's evidence about the Formerly Contested  Areas  and
    Baghdad.  In respect of each governorate, there is  also  reference  to
    the reports produced in March  2019  by  the  European  Asylum  Support
    Office ("EASO") and to the very recent posts on Joel Wing's Musings  on
    Iraq blog.  We have naturally considered all of the background material
    before us but these three  sources  are  notably  well  researched  and
    recent,  and  offer  qualitative  and  quantitative  analysis  of   the
    individual areas in question.  For the avoidance of doubt, however, our
    conclusions are drawn from the evidence as a whole.

Kirkuk Governorate
25. Kirkuk city lies approximately 150 miles north of Baghdad and gives its
    name to the governorate of which it is the capital.  It is  a  disputed
    territory and is highly desirable due to the presence of oil  reserves.
    Insurgent groups including ISIL and its predecessor,  al  Qa'eda,  have
    been active in the area since 2003.  It  has  routinely  recorded  high
    levels of violence.

26. The Iraqi army and PMF forces seized control  of  Kirkuk  from  Kurdish
    forces after the Kurdish Independence Referendum and Kurdish  officials
    were removed from office.  There are growing fears  of  an  Arabisation
    campaign in the region because such policies have been pursued  in  the
    past due to a desire on the  part  of  Baghdad  to  retain  control  of
    Kirkuk's oil reserves.  Dr Fatah  referred  in  his  oral  evidence  to
    Baghdad 'changing the equation' in the  same  way  Saddam  Hussein  had
    done, and described Shia emblems and place names currently  being  used
    in Kirkuk pursuant to such a policy.

27. ISIL continues to operate in the region.  In his first report, Dr Fatah
    states that recent search  operations  by  Iraqi  Security  Forces  had
    uncovered ISIL hideouts in the region and that insurgents had continued
    to make random and irregular hit and run attacks, the aim of which  was
    to destabilise the  security  situation  in  Kirkuk.   In  March  2018,
    following a wave of attacks, a Kurdish MP expressed concern  that  ISIL
    was regrouping in the area.  The MP claimed that Kirkuk was  no  longer
    safe as the ISF had been  unable  to  prevent  ISIL  launching  attacks
    against the civilian population.

28. In his main report, Dr Fatah considered that civilians in  Kirkuk  face
    'some risk  of  indiscriminate  targeting  by  insurgent  groups'.   He
    documents a number of instances of civilians being killed  and  wounded
    by explosives and refers to further incidents  in  which  ISF  and  KRG
    security  forces  have  been  targeted,  particularly  at  checkpoints.
    Insurgent  groups  had  also  been  reported  to   abduct   minorities,
    particularly Kakais.  Having reviewed security incidents from the start
    of January 2018 to 25  February  2019,  Dr  Fatah  concluded  that  the
    majority of recorded attacks in Kirkuk after the referendum appeared to
    be insurgent  attacks  against  military  personnel  although  civilian
    casualties had also been recorded.   ISIL  was  reverting  to  its  old
    tactics  of  hit  and  run  attacks  and  had  retreated  into   caves,
    particularly in the Hamrin mountain range near the city of Kirkuk.

29. Dr Fatah's more recent report - of 21 June 2019 -  provides  a  focused
    update on Hawija, a city which is 45 kilometres to the west of  Kirkuk.
    He states that Hawija is under the control of Sunni Arab  armed  groups
    affiliated with the Popular Mobilisation Forces  ("PMF").   There  were
    reports of PMF abuses against civilians during the battle for Hawija in
    early October 2017.  Many residents had fled  from  Hawija  during  the
    battle and remain displaced in an IDP camp in Laylan, although one such
    camp closed in February 2019 following the return of 402 IDPs to  their
    homes in Hawija.  M�decins Sans Frontieres ("MSF")  had  described  the
    conditions in Hawija as dire, with episodes of violence and  particular
    insecurity along the highway.  A curfew is in place at night and 35% of
    primary health centres remain non-functional,  leaving  many  patients'
    needs unmet.  Citing the March 2019 EASO report, Dr Fatah  stated  that
    ISIL activity in Kirkuk was limited but  that  there  were  pockets  of
    fighters in Hawija and in the Hamrin  mountains.   He  documented  five
    security incidents between 1 October 2018 and 25 May 2019.   The  final
    incident, on 25 May 2019, was the explosion of an Improvised  Explosive
    Device ("IED") in the al-Hawija District of Kirkuk, which  killed  four
    civilians and  wounded  two  others.   The  other  incidents  were  the
    destruction of 247 acres of wheat through fire;  the  discovery  of  an
    ISIL hideout in Hawija; the discovery of  a  mass  grave  near  Hawija,
    believed to contain ISIL victims and the destruction of an  electricity
    pylon in Hawija by ISIL.

30. Examined by Mr Bazini on the specific circumstances in Kirkuk, Dr Fatah
    stated that it was 'fine' but that Hawija was 'ruined'.  He  emphasised
    that the problem with the area was its control and that  a  person  who
    had lived there since the 1970s would have  seen  it  change  hands  on
    several occasions.  Kirkuk was specifically  identified  in  the  Iraqi
    Constitution as a Disputed Territory whose governance would be  finally
    decided by 2007 but that process was still to be completed.

31. Cross-examined by Mr Thomann on  the  situation  in  Kirkuk,  Dr  Fatah
    explained that it was only  the  area  around  Hawija  which  had  been
    controlled by ISIL.  Kirkuk was an ethnically diverse area, with Kurds,
    Arabs, Turkmen, Christians and Assyrians.  When the  Iraqi  authorities
    had taken control of the area, many Kurdish people had fled their homes
    to  two  IDP  camps,  although   some   people   had   returned.    The
    administration had left and there were arrest warrants issued against a
    number of them, including the Head of the  Kirkuk  Provincial  Council.
    Referred to [856] of his report, Dr Fatah stated that the PMF's role in
    Kirkuk was to keep ISIL out.  They had been searching houses  but  they
    now parked their vehicles on the main roads in the area.  The Kurds and
    the Turkmen wanted them to retreat but that had not happened.   He  did
    not accept the suggestion by the  Danish  Immigration  Service  ("DIS")
    that the PMF had left Kirkuk, although he did not know the  numbers  of
    PMF which remained there.  The local police and the  counter  terrorism
    unit might be present in the city but the PMF  remained.   If  the  DIS
    were correct and the PMF had withdrawn, that  would  be  very  positive
    because the PMF were unpopular with residents.  There remained  a  need
    to reinstate the local authorities nevertheless.

32. Dr Fatah was asked about the statement at [757]  of  his  first  report
    that  the  level  of  violent  incidents  in  Kirkuk   still   remained
    "considerably high".  Mr Thomann asked whether it was his view that the
    tension in the area was  high  during  the  process  of  reconciliation
    (following  the  Referendum).   Dr  Fatah  stated  that  it  would   be
    beneficial if there was a sensible conclusion between the GOI  and  the
    KRG over the area.  They needed to have a local election and  reinstate
    the system they had before; bringing people from Baghdad was  no  good.
    They needed to build the local police because the federal  police  were
    not trusted.  The security incidents in the area are  very  low.   ISIL
    had not controlled Kirkuk, apart from Hawija,  and  the  area  was  now
    essentially clear of ISIL.  Controlling Kirkuk would be easier  if  the
    population trusted the security services.

33. Dr Fatah was asked about the Hamrin mountain range.  He said that  ISIL
    maintained a presence there and that  there  was  another  group  which
    called itself the White Flags, which was also present in the area.  The
    mountain range was south of Kirkuk and straddled governorates, reaching
    down towards Baghdad.  Dr Fatah was referred to  the  Musings  on  Iraq
    blog for April 8-14, in which it was stated that a number of  documents
    had been captured from  ISIL.   He  stated  that  this  was  militarily
    significant.  It could not be disputed that ISIL had  lost  control  of
    parts of Mosul and Kirkuk Governorate but it had changed its tactics to
    guerrilla warfare.  They were using tunnels, as  they  were  in  Anbar.
    There was no doubt that their military capability had been reduced.

34. Dr Fatah was asked about the Revenge of the Levant campaign, which  was
    announced by ISIL in April 2019.  He stated that this  was  very  na�ve
    and that ISIL had not gained much.  As an insurgent group, their recent
    pattern was to choose high profile targets and he did  not  think  that
    they were going to rebuild capacity and retake  Mosul.   Dr  Fatah  was
    referred to the latest Musings on Iraq blogs, from 15  April  to  early
    May.  He was referred, in particular,  to  a  graph  which  showed  the
    number of attacks in Kirkuk from January 2018 to April 2019.  A summary
    above the graph suggested that attacks in Kirkuk had  gone  down  since
    the start of the year but that ISIL was 'active in all districts in the
    Province, and has access to Kirkuk city'.  Dr  Fatah  agreed  with  the
    graph and the assessment, stating that it was similar to  what  he  had
    provided.

35. Dr Fatah agreed that the level of violent incidents in  early  May  had
    been very low but that there had been a spike in late  May,  when  ISIL
    had been responsible for burning farms.  He  said  that  this  was  co-
    ordinated in order to destroy the livelihood of the farmers.  He agreed
    with the Musings blog that the level of attacks in late  May  2019  was
    the highest it had been since October 2018 and  that  the  picture  was
    variable.  There had been more recent targeting of the security  forces
    in the region.  Dr Fatah agreed that despite the Revenge of the  Levant
    campaign, it remained the case that ISIL was not capable in this region
    of causing widespread chaos.  He said that the trend was  one  of  'hit
    and go' targeting of specific individuals.  This was why there would be
    an incident in which 20 people were killed, followed  by  no  activity,
    followed by an incident in which a further 5 people were killed.   ISIL
    clearly wanted to be efficient and they were still causing trouble.

36. Dr Fatah was referred to the United Nations Assistance Mission in  Iraq
    ("UNAMI") casualty figures for Kirkuk, which he said were lower because
    they did not include combatants.  The  trend,  he  said,  remained  the
    same.  He was asked to explain the numbers, which showed that the total
    numbers of those killed or injured  in  Kirkuk  were  852  (2014),  299
    (2015), 747 (2016), 112 (2017) and 155 (2018).  He suggested  that  the
    number was particularly high in 2014, when ISIL rose in the  area,  and
    in 2016, at which point a number of mass graves  were  discovered.   He
    agreed that there was a 'lag' in the figures, caused by  the  discovery
    of mass graves; the figures did not mean that people had been killed at
    that time.  Dr Fatah agreed with Joel Wing, the author of  the  Musings
    on Iraq blog, who said that Kirkuk stood out because ISIL had been able
    to regularly  attack  Kirkuk  city.   He  agreed  that  this  view  was
    expressed in August 2018, however, and that matters had  changed  since
    ISIL lost Hawija, which had been  their  hub.   They  now  had  to  use
    sleeper cells and were in the process of restructuring.

37.  Dr  Fatah  stated  that  the  humanitarian  situation  in  Kirkuk  was
    challenging, and agreed with the assessment by MSF that it was  'dire'.



38. Re-examined  by  Mr  Bazini  about  Kirkuk,  Dr  Fatah  said  that  the
    population of Kirkuk was around 1.5 million people and the districts in
    which  there  were  permanently  operating  ISIL  attack  cells  had  a
    population of around half  a  million  people.   There  was  a  durable
    support base for ISIL in some towns and villages and  it  was  able  to
    move freely and expand in the area.  Kirkuk was bad and suffered from a
    lack of infrastructure.  He was not able to state  that  Hawija  was  a
    contested area, as defined, but it was bad and had  no  infrastructure.
    There was also the White Flag group which had begun to establish itself
    in the area.  Wherever there was community  support  for  such  groups,
    they would remain.  There was a security vacuum  in  the  area  and  it
    would remain fragile  and  complex  until  the  political  problem  was
    solved.  A large number of IDPs had not returned to the region, some of
    whom would be linked to Kurdish forces.  The situation  in  Kirkuk  was
    vulnerable.  It had the physical infrastructure but the  political  and
    social structure was very vulnerable.  Kidnappings  and  assassinations
    occurred at checkpoints, particularly in rural areas around the city.

39. In addition to  the  evidence  of  Dr  Fatah,  the  advocates  referred
    regularly  to  the  detailed  reports  from  EASO.   The  reports  were
    published on 11 March 2019.  The first contains a general  overview  of
    the security situation in Iraq.  The second contains an examination  of
    the security situation in the governorates.

40. Section 2.4 of the EASO report considers the situation in Kirkuk.  Like
    Dr Fatah, the EASO report emphasises the ethnic diversity of Kirkuk and
    the long-standing struggle over the control  of  the  governorate.   It
    records the International Crisis Group as stating  that  the  area  has
    experienced 'the worst turbulence' in recent years.  ISIL took over the
    region around Hawija when the Iraqi army collapsed in  2014.   The  PUK
    moved in and controlled Kirkuk city between 2014 and 2017, during which
    time there was a standoff between ISIL and the Peshmerga, with repeated
    clashes along the  southern  and  western  parts  of  the  city.   ISIL
    controlled Hawija until it was expelled in 2017.  From Hawija district,
    ISIL carried out attacks against the Kirkuk governorate from 2014.  The
    area has seen significant displacement throughout the period.

41. ISIL was removed from Hawija by the ISF and the PMUs in  early  October
    2017.  In retaliation for the Kurdish Independence  Referendum,  Kirkuk
    city was retaken from the PUK Peshmerga by the ISF and the PMUs.   Like
    Dr Fatah, EASO considers Hawija to be under the control of Sunni  armed
    groups affiliated with the PMUs.

42. The EASO report quotes the Iraq Body Count  ("IBC")  as  recording  126
    security related incidents leading to 276 civilian deaths during  2018,
    a decrease compared to 2017 when IBC reported 175 incidents leading  to
    950 civilian deaths.  The intensity of civilian deaths (which is deaths
    per 100,000 of the population) dropped from 62.9 in  2017  to  18.3  in
    2018, placing Kirkuk as the governorate with the second intensity level
    in both years (behind Ninewa).  The  incidents  were  gunfire  (34.9%),
    IEDs (31.7%) and executions or summary killing (28.6%).  The number  of
    ISIL attacks dropped from 39 per month in the first quarter of 2018  to
    25.3 per month in the third quarter.  EASO accords  with  Dr  Fatah  in
    stating  that  ISIL  no  longer  controls  any  territory   in   Kirkuk
    governorate but that it retains pockets of fighters in Hawija  and  the
    Hamrin mountains.  It retains permanently  operating  attack  cells  in
    Kirkuk, Hawija, Rashad, Zab, Dibis, Makhmour and Ghaeda and has durable
    support zones in certain areas, including leadership  elements  in  the
    Hamrin mountains.   In those areas where it enjoyed support,  ISIL  was
    able to move freely across the terrain at night and is actively  waging
    attacks in order to expand its freedom of movement  during  the  night.
    It assessed that Hawija and Daquq districts  were  contested,  in  that
    ISIL exerted physical and psychological pressure over  the  population,
    as indicated  by  abandonment  of  villages,  targeted  destruction  of
    agriculture/infrastructure, repeated raids and assassinations of  local
    social hierarchy.  Kirkuk was ISIL's most prominent attack location  in
    the first ten months of 2018.  The  level  of  security  incidents  and
    level of violence was still relatively high but  was  improving.   What
    stood out was ISIL's ability to attack Kirkuk city,  and  most  attacks
    appeared near the Hamrin mountains, hitting the south-western  half  of
    the governorate.

43. Small arms attacks, targeted assassinations and suicide vests were used
    in 2018 and attacks on local authority figures were particularly noted.
     This was considered to be part of ISIL's attempts  to  regain  control
    over rural areas.  Civilians continued to be at risk from IED  attacks,
    and small arms fire.  Numerous village chiefs were  killed  in  October
    and November 2018 as part of ISIL's campaign  to  depopulate  strategic
    areas.  ISIL used its freedom of movement at  night  to  kill  farmers,
    burn houses and crops, destroy irrigation systems and blow up  tractors
    and irrigation systems.  ISIL was reported in  autumn  2018  to  attack
    Kirkuk's towns and civilians and engaging in  kidnapping,  retaliation,
    and gun battles, including in the daytime.  The use of fake checkpoints
    for ambushing and kidnapping had also been noted.

44. Other types of violence, particularly due to organised crime, political
    reasons or inter-ethnic land disputes were also noted in Kirkuk, as was
    election-related violence.  There have been reports of the PMUs and the
    government  forces  being  involved  in  criminality  and  one   source
    suggested that two  militias  affiliated  with  the  Badr  organisation
    demand a protection tax from local traders and killed those who  refuse
    to comply.

45. The PMUs tended to control the  villages  around  Kirkuk  city  and  to
    control entry to the city.  The city itself was under  the  control  of
    the local police and counter terrorism force.  The Federal Police - who
    are perceived to be Shia from outside the area - were mistrusted by the
    local Sunni population.  The Iraqi Counter Terrorism Force ("CTF") were
    generally perceived as being  more  professional.   There  is  a  heavy
    concentration of police garrisons in Kirkuk, which  complicates  ISIL's
    ability to operate.  Nevertheless, they were often failing  to  protect
    civilians.    According to the KRG, the departure of the  Peshmerga  in
    October 2017 was reported to have left a security vacuum  in  parts  of
    Kirkuk, Diyala and Salah al-Din.  This  had  allowed  ISIL  to  operate
    there and  to  prepare  attacks.   Other  sources  suggested  that  the
    security situation in Kirkuk had improved after October 2017,  although
    the situation was said to be fragile and complex.  The intensity of the
    violence in Kirkuk was characterised as medium high, as it was in Salah
    al-Din and Diyala. A two week long offensive  against  ISIL  in  summer
    2018 (called "Revenge of the Martyrs") had led to a significant decline
    in the number of attacks but ISIL cells were  not  completely  uprooted
    from Kirkuk and attacks continued.

46. The White Flags reportedly launched attacks in the first half of  2018,
    including an attack on an oil field and the abduction  and  killing  of
    passengers at checkpoints.

47. Kirkuk hosts a significant number  of  IDPs,  albeit  that  the  number
    reduced  from  180,000  individuals  in  December   2017   to   108,000
    individuals in December  2018.   The  majority  come  from  within  the
    governorate.  The International Office for Migration  ("IOM")  reported
    in December 2018 that 319,000 IDPs originating from Kirkuk had returned
    to the governorate.  Due to rates  of  return,  the  government  closed
    Daquq camp in September 2018, causing hundreds of families to return to
    liberated areas.  75% of  displaced  families  from  Kirkuk  city  have
    returned and the families who are reluctant to do so  are  families  of
    KDP or KDP Peshmerga members.   High  ranking  PUK  members  are  still
    displaced, although state employees and soldiers have been able to stay
    in Kirkuk.

48. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian  Affairs
    ("UNOCHA") and the IOM reported that returnees to certain areas were at
    risk of secondary displacement because conditions  for  returnees  were
    described  as  high  or  very  high  severity  due  to   infrastructure
    destruction.   Basic   services   remained   limited   and   livelihood
    opportunities were low in  urban  centres  and  non-existent  in  rural
    areas.  Those displaced from  rural  areas  were  reluctant  to  return
    without guarantees of protection  and  Hawija  had  been  described  in
    April 2018 as a ghost town.  Some people had been refused  resettlement
    in certain areas and others had returned to IDP camps from those  areas
    - most notably Hawija.  Ongoing military  operations  had  caused  some
    further, small scale displacement.

49. Focusing on civilian infrastructure, EASO  quoted  the  World  Bank  as
    stating that  7%  of  housing  in  Kirkuk  had  been  damaged.   Health
    facilities had suffered and Hawija's  five  main  health  centres  were
    partially or completely damaged.  The report gave the same figure as Dr
    Fatah in  assessing  that  35%  of  primary  health  centres  were  not
    functioning  in  Kirkuk  governorate.   Agricultural  areas  had   been
    severely damaged  during  the  conflict  against  ISIL.   Around  forty
    Kurdish villages west of Kirkuk had been  depopulated  and  repopulated
    with Arab families.  Reports of ISIL attacks on infrastructure  targets
    in Kirkuk persisted into late 2018.  Numerous road around  Kirkuk  were
    considered to be 'primary risk and  the  highway  between  Baghdad  and
    Kirkuk is one of the most  dangerous  routes  in  Iraq,  with  militant
    activities, fake checkpoints and explosions mentioned.

50. The Musings on Iraq blog by Joel Wing was also  cited  before  us.   Dr
    Fatah considered Joel Wing to be reliable, both as to his raw data  and
    the inferences he drew from it.  The value of the blog lies in the fact
    that it is very up-to-date and contains a breakdown  of  the  types  of
    security incidents  on  a  week-by-week  basis.    Each  post  contains
    statistics  concerning  the  number  of  type  of  security  incidents,
    followed by the author's evaluation of the security situation.  Amongst
    other activities recently reported in Kirkuk are the burning  of  farms
    (by  ISIL)  in  order  to  intimidate  locals  and  extort  money;  the
    exploitation of 116 abandoned villages in the south  Kirkuk  and  North
    and East Diyala; assaults on checkpoints and gunfire.

Ninewa Governorate
51. Ninewa is Iraq's north western governorate, lying to the east of Syria.
     Its capital, Mosul, is Iraq's second city and is more than 300km north
    of Baghdad.  It is the third largest governorate geographically and has
    the  second  highest  population  (3.7  million  in   2018).    Mosul's
    population is approximately 1.5 million.  Mosul is an important traffic
    hub, with direct connections to many parts of Iraq  and  to  Syria  and
    Turkey.  It is the most  ethnically  diverse  governorate,  with  Sunni
    Arabs, Kurds, Christians Shabaks and Yezidis.  Sunni  Arabs  constitute
    the majority but other groups  share  power  and  influence.   The  KRG
    controls two districts.  The Ninewa Plains are home  to  the  Christian
    and Shabak populations.  The Turkmen are prominent  in  Tal  Afar.   In
    Sinjar and Lalish, the Yezidis are in the majority.

52. Much of the governorate is officially disputed  territory  between  the
    GOI and the KRG.  The border line of control is situated in the  Ninewa
    Plains and in Tal Afar district.

53. After years of violent extremism and Sunni Arab nationalism in  Ninewa,
    Mosul was taken by ISIL in June 2014.  ISIL attacks in Sinjar and other
    areas displaced nearly 1 million people in the following months.  Under
    ISIL control, Ninewa's minority communities were subjected to  torture,
    public executions, crucifixions, kidnappings and sexual slavery.

54. After a battle which lasted for nine months, Mosul was retaken  by  the
    ISF and the international coalition  in  July  2017.   The  battle  for
    Western Mosul was particularly fierce and much of that part of the city
    was destroyed by heavy munitions.  It is estimated that  eight  million
    tonnes of rubble were created.  54,000 houses were destroyed and 64,000
    families were displaced.  Significant amounts  of  unexploded  ordnance
    remain, as do booby-traps set by ISIL.  Estimates  of  the  numbers  of
    civilians killed during the three year conflict  range  widely.   There
    were even reports of ISIL killing civilians who tried to  leave  Mosul.
    We have already recorded above that, of the 202 mass graves reported by
    UNAMI in November 2018, 95 were  found  in  Ninewa,  especially  around
    Mosul and Sinjar.  Estimates of the number of victims  found  in  these
    sites range from 4000 to 15,000.

55. In his first report, Dr Fatah adjudged the current situation in  Ninewa
    to be unstable.  Although ISIL controls  no  territory  in  Ninewa,  it
    remains active and is concentrated in areas  close  to  the  Iraq-Syria
    border and in the Badoush area between Mosul  and  Tal  Afar.   Various
    armed groups and extremist sleeper cells operate in the region

56. Dr Fatah noted that the IOM documented more than a million returnees to
    Ninewa by January 2018, although the same report noted that  conditions
    were largely unconducive to safe and dignified returns,  with  security
    as the main hindrance.  Basic services were said  to  be  improving  in
    East Mosul in January 2018 but the situation in Western Mosul  and  Old
    Mosul were poor, with no electricity or water services.

57. UNAMI reported that  Ninewa  was  the  worst  affected  governorate  in
    December 2018, with 26 civilian casualties (7 killed, 19 injured).   Dr
    Fatah states at [374] of his report that civilians  face  'a  level  of
    risk of indiscriminate attacks by insurgent groups; that ISIL is  still
    present in the region in sleeper cells; and that  security  forces  are
    particularly targeted by this group.   He  supports  those  conclusions
    with reference to 11 security incidents between 6 January 2018  and  27
    January 2019.  The three incidents in 2019 relate to the detection  and
    elimination of ISIL units and facilities.  The incidents on  25  August
    2018 and 1 June 2018 were also  of  that  nature.   The  remaining  six
    incidents involved ISIL activity.

58. Dr Fatah helpfully dedicated a separate section of his first report  to
    the situation in Sinjar.  Sinjar was 80% destroyed during the conflict,
    he reports, and low numbers have  returned.   There  is  a  significant
    challenge to  rebuild  communities  by  providing  security  and  basic
    services, addressing public grievances and seeking  accountability  and
    justice so that people can  return  to  their  homes  and  communities.
    Sinjar falls within  disputed  territory  and  the  dispute  creates  a
    situation of chronic insecurity.  There is deep  mistrust  between  the
    various ethnic groups in the area and a range of armed  actors  operate
    there.

59. In response to the respondent's written questions, Dr Fatah stated that
    the theme of the more recent incidents in Ninewa  indicated  that  ISIL
    was operating a more selective approach to  targeting  victims.   Those
    working for the security services were targeted by ISIL and vice versa.
     Major security issues  nevertheless  remained.   Bodies  with  gunshot
    wounds had been discovered in  Mosul.   There  had  been  instances  of
    abduction and the area was still affected with explosive  hazards  such
    as mines.  There had  also  been  reports  of  indiscriminate  violence
    against civilians.

60. In his 21 June 2019 report, Dr Fatah provided an update on the security
    situation in one specific part of Ninewa: Makhmour, which  is  part  of
    the Disputed Territories and is administered by Ninewa, although  Erbil
    lays claim to it.  The Peshmerga  withdrew  from  Makhmour  in  October
    2017.  ISIL had held the area for two days in August 2016 before  being
    forced out by Kurdish forces.  Most residents fled before ISIL  arrived
    in  order  to  avoid  their  atrocities.   Since  the  city  has   been
    recaptured, there have been reports of attacks.  In April 2019, the  US
    army spokesman said that ISIL was attempting to 'refit, reorganise, and
    recruit in the vicinity of Makhmour'.  This  followed  activity  during
    2017, including bomb blasts and ambushes on security  forces.   It  was
    reported that ISIL had a renewed presence in the area, particularly  in
    the rural parts.  In early summer 2019, there were a number of  reports
    of agricultural fires after farmers in the area had been the subject of
    extortion demands by ISIL members.  It had been reported that ISIL were
    becoming increasingly brazen in the area; whilst they were clustered in
    caves and ravines, they approached the local population more often  and
    seemed to have a support base in the area.  ISIL cells  plainly  remain
    active in the area and  sporadic  attacks  continue.   ISIL  have  been
    recruiting in the area and threatening the locals in  order  to  obtain
    money and livestock.  Dr Fatah concluded that the security  vacuum  had
    deepened in this area and the situation had worsened dramatically, with
    a vast increase in the number of attacks and a more brazen approach  to
    interaction with the local populace.

61. In answer to questions from Mr Bazini, Dr Fatah stated that  Mosul  had
    been razed to the ground  and  that  a  recent  international  estimate
    suggested that the cost of rebuilding would be in  the  region  of  $60
    billion US.  He said that ISIL had been everywhere, and had even  wired
    up fridges as booby traps so that soldiers who subsequently opened them
    would be killed or injured.  There was not  much  infrastructure  left,
    whether housing or drinking water.  Some refugees  had  returned.   The
    international  community  had  pledged  vastly  less  than  the   $60bn
    required.  He had not been to Mosul himself.  ISIL had treated Mosul as
    their capital in Iraq.  The Christians had  been  expelled.   They  had
    destroyed the Yazidis.  They had destroyed various mosques and anything
    which did not conform to their beliefs.  They had destroyed  historical
    sites across Ninewa and had executed intellectuals including university
    lecturers who did not agree with their ways.   The  infrastructure  had
    existed whilst ISIL were in occupation but the city had been  destroyed
    in the effort to get them out.

62. Cross-examined by Mr Thomann, Dr Fatah stated that the  ethnic  make-up
    of the region was more complex than Kirkuk or Diyala.  In Mosul, it was
    really fascinating.  Before ISIL, it had been  divided  along  medieval
    lines, with different groups having their own sections of the city.  Dr
    Fatah's father had worked there and he had seen  Kurds  there  in  Arab
    dress, such was the diversity.  There was a  large  Kurdish  population
    but also a significant Sunni presence; one of Saddam Hussein's sons had
    been killed there whilst in hiding.   Some  places  in  the  city  were
    operating but there were booby traps and other risks.

63. As to the risk from ISIL in the region,  Mr  Thomann  suggested  to  Dr
    Fatah that there were sporadic  and  irregular  attacks  and  that  the
    pattern was generally of the security forces targeting  ISIL  and  vice
    versa.  There were relatively few incidents relating to civilians.   Dr
    Fatah confirmed that this was the new ISIL strategy.  As for the return
    of IDPs, he said that Mosul was very complicated but  that  people  had
    returned to Sinjar.  In Sinjar, ISIL had operated a policy  of  killing
    the men and taking the women to Raqah as sex slaves.  The challenge was
    to see whether the ancient Yazidi community could be rebuilt after such
    trauma.  This was particularly difficult when it was recalled that  the
    Yazidi blood line came from the  mother.   Fifty  two  mass  graves  of
    Yazidis had been discovered in the region.

64. Dr Fatah was asked  about  the  significance  of  governors  and  civil
    servants beginning work again in the region.  He said that this  was  a
    very positive sign because they were no longer in fear.  Referred to an
    article in the respondent's bundle  about  East  Mosul  which  recorded
    students and shops operating there, Dr Fatah said that it was  possible
    that it was not as badly destroyed as the rest of the city.  The  first
    opportunity people had to return to their home area, they would do  so.
    It was fair to say that life was returning.  ISIL could not invade  the
    city any more, although that may change in the future.

65. Mr Thomann asked about the update on the  situation  in  Makhmour.   Dr
    Fatah explained that it was a  remote  area  in  Ninewa,  although  the
    respondent treated it as being part of Erbil.  He had  highlighted  the
    situation there because of recent security incidents, particularly  the
    burning of crops by ISIL cells.  This was another strategy used by ISIL
    to cause trouble.  It  was  possible  that  they  were  hiding  in  the
    mountain range nearby

66. Re-examined by Mr Bazini, Dr Fatah stated that Mosul was  terribly  bad
    and mostly destroyed.  The structures  in  the  city  were  either  not
    standing or unsafe.  There were no mosques remaining.  There were  dead
    bodies and all sorts of diseases there.  The only real solution in  the
    area was political and ISIL could not be defeated long-term  otherwise.
    The PMU and other actors do not provide security  for  the  people  and
    their roles are not defined.  There was no operational police force and
    now, if you knew an influential person, you could get away with murder.
     He pointed out that there was no one to stop  ISIL  or  the  abuse  of
    power by the PMU, and reminded us that  the  PMU  were  not  under  the
    control of an elected body.

67. Dr Fatah was referred to a BBC News Article which  suggested  that  the
    western side  of  Mosul  was  in  ruins,  whereas  the  east  side  was
    functioning.  Mr Thomann had suggested that there some day to day  life
    in that part of the city, despite major problems remaining.   Dr  Fatah
    responded that most of the people had worked in the destroyed  part  of
    the city.  It would be positive when they started to rebuild the  city.
    It had not been an industrial city but there had been a  major  factory
    there and some agriculture.  Mosul was not  like  any  other  place  in
    Iraq; it had historically narrow roads and people used to go there  for
    city breaks but that was not the case now.  Many people from there  had
    gone to Baghdad or the IKR.

68. The EASO report dedicates section  2.5  to  Ninewa.  It  describes  the
    plethora of armed  groups  operating  in  Ninewa  under  the  following
    headings: formal Iraqi Security Forces  ("ISF");  Popular  Mobilisation
    Units ("PMU"); Kurdish Security Forces; militias aligned with the  KRG;
    non-aligned  militias;  foreign   forces;   and   insurgents.    Ninewa
    governorate had been divided into three areas of control.   Mosul  city
    was controlled by the local police.  The outskirts  of  the  city  were
    controlled by various PMUs which are both Shia and local militias.  The
    rest of the governorate was controlled by the Iraqi army, which retains
    a large presence in the governorate.  The image of the army  in  Ninewa
    has improved significantly.  It plays a significant  role  in  securing
    Mosul by manning checkpoints and playing a  role  in  decision  making.
    The increased popularity of the army stems from the local  population's
    preference for the army over the Shia militia.

69. Considering the presence of ISIL in the region, EASO reported that ISIL
    exerted a great  deal  of  physical  and  psychological  pressure  over
    populations even if  it  did  not  meet  the  doctrinal  definition  of
    control.  ISIL could not hold  terrain  but  there  were  a  number  of
    indicators that it was contesting control.  The picture  is  strikingly
    similar to that in Kirkuk:

         These indicators include the  abandonment  of  populated  villages,
         destruction of agricultural products and  infrastructure,  repeated
         raids,  and  assassinations  which  target   the   local   security
         hierarchy'.  ISW further noted that in these areas civilians cannot
         rely upon security services for adequate protection.

70. EASO quotes Michael  Knights  as  stating  that  ISIL  has  permanently
    operating attack cells in at least 27  areas  of  Iraq,  including  the
    following areas in Ninewa: Mosul, Qayyarah, Hatra and the  Iraq  Turkey
    pipeline corridor south west of Mosul, Badush and Sinjar.   Mr  Knights
    had suggested that in various parts of Iraq, including southern Ninewa,
    'the reality is that the Islamic State still rules the  night,  meaning
    that key parts of the country  have  only  really  been  liberated  for
    portions of each day".  It was estimated in  January  2019  that  there
    were at least 300 ISIL fighters in sleeper cells in  Mosul,  'ready  to
    move when the opportunity arises'.  ISIL controlled no territory in the
    governorate but it was concentrated in more remote areas.  Attacks were
    carried out at night on a regular basis, taking the form of explosions,
    killings and assassinations. Sources from the US Consulate in Erbil and
    USAID were reported to have drawn  a  distinction  (in  November  2018)
    between the threat posed by ISIL to the civilian population in  Kirkuk,
    where it was seen as a threat to the security actors  and  authorities,
    and in Ninewa, Diyala and Anbar, where ISIL "would also be a threat  to
    the civilian population."

71. EASO reported the following UNAMI casualty  figures  for  Ninewa:  2014
    (2158 killed and injured), 2015 (899), 2016  (2791),  (2621)  and  2018
    (182).  Considering the IBC figures for the governorate, it  was  noted
    that there were  600  security  incidents  in  2017,  leading  to  9211
    civilian deaths, and 217 security incidents in 2018, leading to 1596[4]
    civilian deaths.  The governorate still had the  highest  intensity  of
    violence in Iraq, with 46.46  civilian  deaths  per  100,000  in  2018,
    compared with 265.15 per 100,000 in 2017.  Mosul, Sinjar and  Tal  Afar
    were the most dangerous areas.  Most incidents  recorded  by  IBC  were
    executions/summary killings (44.7%), gunfire (32.3%) and IEDs (18.9%).

72. ISIL had continued to perpetrate asymmetric attacks in  Ninewa,  as  it
    had in other governorates, during 2018.  According to Michael  Knights,
    ISIL had focused on rural insurgency in Ninewa after losing Mosul.   It
    had focused on the areas named above.  It  had  produced  62%  'quality
    attacks' in the first ten months of 2018, including  37  assassinations
    of local leaders.   In the  same  period,  there  had  been  17.1  ISIL
    attacks per month in Ninewa and 3 in Mosul city, the reason  for  which
    was thought by Mr Knights to be the group's  inactivity  in  Mosul  and
    there being 'practically no visible insurgent activity at all'  in  Tal
    Afar.  Joel Wing noted that the group had not started  attacking  towns
    until the end of the year.  The UN Security Council noted a tendency on
    ISIL's part to target local mayors for colluding with the  authorities.
    Police and PMU members had also been targeted.   IEDs  and  small  arms
    fire had been the  main  cause  of  civilian  deaths  and  one  of  the
    governorates in which ISIL posed a threat to civilians was Ninewa.   At
    the end of 2018, ISIL had begun using  heavily  armed  groups  akin  to
    special forces who were capable of  outgunning  isolated  outposts  and
    making highways  and  village  roads  too  dangerous  to  use.   Whilst
    security forces were continuing operations to clear ISIL from the area,
    attacks continued.  In the latter  half  of  2018,  a  number  of  ISIL
    members had been arrested, an explosives factory had been discovered in
    Sinjar and 20 operatives had been killed in Badush, Ninewa.  There  was
    then a description of specific ISIL activities during the year, largely
    targeting authority figures but  in  which  some  civilians  were  also
    killed or injured.

73. EASO cited DIS and Landinfo as concluding that the  violence  in  Mosul
    was perpetrated by the multiple armed actors as well as ISIL and  that,
    in some cases, people were PMU members by day and criminals  by  night.
    There had been reports of clashes between the various  security  actors
    in  Ninewa.   There  were  reports  of  extortion  by  the   PMUs   and
    embezzlement of public funds.  Fake  PMUs  were  created  in  order  to
    benefit criminally from these opportunities.  The  US  withdrawal  from
    Syria was thought  to accelerate ISIL's resurgence and there  had  been
    no attempt to address the root cause which led to ISIL's rise.

74. By December 2018, more than a million were displaced from  their  homes
    in  Ninewa,  with  more  than  half  of  those  displaced  within   the
    governorate.  It nevertheless ranks top in the governorates in terms of
    the numbers who have returned, with more than 1.6 million  having  done
    so at that point, although UNOCHA complained that  forced  returns  had
    taken place, often leading to secondary  displacement.   Families  with
    perceived ISIL links were prevented from returning  to  some  areas  of
    Ninewa and some families had been forcibly  moved  from  villages  near
    Mosul to camps in Ninewa due to such links.  Mosul had by far the  most
    returns, nearing 1 million individuals.  Most had returned  from  other
    parts of the governorate although returns from the IKR were also noted.
     There had been very few returns to Baaj, where  the  Badr  PMU  is  in
    control.  Again, this was due to a prohibition on those perceived to be
    affiliated with ISIL returning there.  Very few Yazidis had returned to
    Sinjar due to perceptions of insecurity and the KRG  had  hindered  the
    return of this group to Sinjar, through pressure and incentives.   More
    than 238,000 families who returned were likely to face some category of
    harsh conditions  upon  return,  with  54%  falling  under  the  medium
    category and 29% in the low category.  15% were  likely  to  face  high
    severity conditions and 2% face very high.  Sinjar is the area in  Iraq
    to which people are least willing to return.   The  highest  number  of
    people in need are in Ninewa: more than 2.1 million.

75. As in  Kirkuk,  there  was  evidence  of  ISIL  targeting  agricultural
    infrastructure in Ninewa.  This was particularly  so  in  Sinjar.   The
    government's reconstruction plan had not yet addressed the problems and
    safe water remained a problem in areas of return.  Like Dr Fatah,  EASO
    highlighted the level of destruction in West Mosul and  Sinjar  but  it
    also highlighted other areas and towns, including Baaj, which was  said
    to be the town with the highest level of destruction in Iraq.  Baaj had
    no primary health  facilities  whatsoever.   Western  Mosul  was  still
    completely destroyed and almost no one returned to the  city.   Corpses
    and diseased posed a risk to health.  Unexploded  ordnance  remained  a
    threat.  Road travel is difficult between Mosul and Sinjar due  to  the
    presence of 30 different checkpoints, each manned by a different  group
    and  with  varying  levels  of  control   and   predictability.    Fake
    checkpoints are a phenomenon in  Ninewa,  as  in  other  parts  of  the
    formerly contested areas.

76.  The Musings on Iraq blog of the period  April  1  -  June  2019  sheds
    further light on the security situation in Ninewa.  Joel Wing  assesses
    Ninewa (amongst other parts of the formerly contested areas) to be  the
    core area of ISIL's efforts to rebuild.   Over  this  period,  Mr  Wing
    documented various types of ISIL activity  in  Ninewa,  including  farm
    burning and  extortion  attempts.   In  his  10  June  blog,  Mr  Wings
    considered that ISIL were attempting to force taxes upon local  farmers
    and to drive some out so that they can take over the villages: "Gaining
    towns is important because it allows training camps to  be  established
    so that ISIL can rebuild its cadres".  He also documented  a  car  bomb
    and other activity in Mosul, which showed that ISIL still had access to
    this major urban area.  Earlier in the year there was a truck bomb in a
    market and a video-recorded execution of a peshmerga soldier in Sinjar.
     In the period 15-21 May, Ninewa residents reported that 30 villages in
    Ninewa had been emptied as the lack of security allowed  ISIL  to  roam
    and carry out this new strategy.   In  the  preceding  week,  the  blog
    carried accounts of the targeting of local authority figures  alongside
    a report that Ninewa Operations Command intended to  arm  villagers  to
    repel ISIL activity.  There were reports  of  extortion  and  militants
    hidings in caves and a local official said  that  ISIL  were  making  a
    return to the governorate.  Similar reports  appeared,  in  respect  of
    Baaj, in the final blog for April.


Salah al-Din Governorate
77. Salah al-Din lies directly to the north west  of  Baghdad.   It  has  a
    population of over 1.5 million.  Tikrit city  is  the  capital  of  the
    governorate and was the birthplace of Saddam Hussein.  It is considered
    an important centre of  power  for  the  Sunni  Arabs.   They  are  the
    predominant ethnic group but Shia Muslims, Turkmen and Kurds also  live
    there.

78. ISIL captured the Tooz district in the summer of 2014.  It also  seized
    control of the oil town of Baiji in the north and the  capital  Tikrit.
    Other cities in the governorate withstood attacks and were unconquered.
     It was the first governorate in which control was regained from  ISIL,
    with the insurgents removed from most of the key population centres  by
    mid 2015.  130,000 IDPs returned in July 2015  and  a  further  360,000
    returned by December 2016, almost all of whom were Sunni  Arab.   There
    were higher rates of violence  after  the  removal  of  ISIL,  however,
    including abduction and killing and the destruction and deprivation  of
    property.  This was largely attributed to the PMU.

79. The governorate also suffered in the wake of the  Kurdish  Independence
    Referendum.  The ethnically mixed city of Tuz Khurmato, which lies just
    to the south  of  Kirkuk  governorate,  witnessed  significant  clashes
    between Peshmerga and ISF forces.  On 16 October 2017, serious fighting
    between the two sides saw the death of 50  civilians  as  well  as  the
    looting of property by the local population.  Heavy weaponry  was  used
    in densely populated areas in  that  month  and  in  the  months  which
    followed and civilians  were  killed  and  wounded  as  a  result.   An
    estimated 35,000 people fled the city in the face of this violence  and
    intimidation  from  Turkmen  armed   groups.    Predominantly   Kurdish
    residents were targeted in these  actions,  and  in  looting  by  other
    residents of the city.  This was  thought  to  be  retaliation  by  the
    Turkmen population for perceived marginalisation by the KRG government.
    When the Kurds were expelled from Tuz Khurmato in the aftermath of  the
    Referendum, the  city  was  taken  over  by  one  of  the  most  senior
    commanders in the Badr Organisation, one  of  the  most  powerful  Shia
    militia.  He has reportedly developed a personal militia with the local
    Turkmen Shia, who are reportedly involved in looting,  arms  and  drugs
    trafficking.  Displacement and civilian casualties continue to occur in
    the area due to conflict between armed actors in the region,  including
    the comparatively recently formed White Flag group.

80. As with other parts of  the  formerly  contested  areas,  armed  groups
    proliferate in the region, consisting  of  official  Iraqi  forces  and
    police; PMUs; and other militia representing the ethnic groups  in  the
    governorate.  There is a proliferation of  militias  and  armed  groups
    that are not under government control.

81. In his first report, Dr Fatah states that Salah al  Din  has  been  the
    centre of many insurgent attacks since 2003 and that it was second only
    to Baghdad in December 2017.   He  cites  examples  of  abductions  and
    attacks in 2018 but endorses the view expressed in the Musings on  Iraq
    blog that ISIL might be reducing activity in  this  governorate  as  it
    focuses on Diyala and Kirkuk.  Nevertheless, there  remain  small-scale
    attacks perpetrated by cells of  fighters.   Some  attacks  by  sleeper
    cells have taken place in Tikrit.

82. Dr Fatah notes the importance of Baiji city to  the  oil  industry,  in
    that it houses the largest oil refinery in the country.  It took months
    of battles to reclaim Baiji and much assistance was provided to the ISF
    by the PMUs.  The city is still troubled by issues surrounding the  oil
    industry.  IDPs have been slow to return due to insecurity and the  PMU
    directives.  ISIL have planted roadside bombs in the area and  the  ISF
    has recently intensified efforts to locate and  destroy  the  remaining
    ISIL presence.

83. Dr Fatah considers civilians to be  at  'some  risk  of  indiscriminate
    attacks by insurgent groups' in Salah  al  Din.   Security  forces  and
    village chiefs are at particular risk of  being  targeted  by  ISIL  or
    other armed groups.  There have also been  reports  of  kidnappings  by
    Shia militia groups.  Dr Fatah  then  gives  37  examples  of  security
    incidents during the period.  Many of these  incidents  relate  to  the
    detection of ISIL cells and equipment,  rather  than  actions  by  ISIL
    against  the  civilian  population  or  the  security  apparatus.   The
    remaining entries, however,  relate  to  the  use  of  small  arms  and
    explosive  devices  by  ISIL  and  unidentified  armed  groups  against
    authority and security figures and, to a lessening extent, the civilian
    population.

84. In response to written questions from the respondent, Dr  Fatah  stated
    that the fight against ISIL in Salah al Din had led to a  reduction  in
    its military capabilities but that it was necessary to look at the root
    causes for its support.  In Salah al  Din,  in  particular,  there  was
    growing Sunni alienation caused by the imposition of Shia rule (by  the
    PMUs) over  the  governorate.   Civilians  remained  at  some  risk  of
    indiscriminate attacks in the region although ISIL were now  conducting
    more targeted operations.  They continued to have access to weapons, as
    the discovery of weapons caches showed.

85. Examined by Mr Knafler about the situation in Salah al  Din,  Dr  Fatah
    stated that Tuz Khurmato was said to be the most dangerous place.   The
    Kurds were being 'kicked out' and the insurgency was quite high.  Those
    in charge would not allow a Kurdish (PUK) flag to be flown when it  had
    been placed on a statue; it was taken down and replaced with  an  Iraqi
    flag.

86. Examined by Mr Bazini, Dr Fatah stated that ISIL had not occupied  much
    of this governorate, which was the Sunni heartland or 'Sunni Triangle'.
     They were able to find support in the area, however, and could be very
    effective.

87. In cross-examination, Dr Fatah  was  asked  by  Mr  Thomann  about  Tuz
    Khurmato.  He said that the Kurds had ruled the area  before  2017  and
    had partitioned the communities.  When the city came back under central
    government control, the residents  were  disillusioned  and  there  was
    violence.  He agreed that some people had returned but  this  was  from
    the first wave.  Considering the governorate as a whole, he  considered
    the ISIL presence to be akin to Diyala.  They  had  an  insurgency  and
    they selected their targets.  It was  correct  to  assert,  as  in  the
    Landinfo report, that their operations were limited by the PMU and that
    there were pockets of fighters remaining.   They  no  longer  did  mass
    attacks, hence the decrease in the casualty  figures.   It  was  mostly
    people in the security forces who were targeted but civilians who  were
    queuing at a checkpoint might also be  killed  if  the  checkpoint  was
    attacked.

88. Dr Fatah was asked  about  a  statement  made  by  Michael  Knights  in
    December 2018, suggesting that the decrease in ISIL's activity in Salah
    al Din might be due to the pressure from the  partnership  between  the
    Shia and Sunni  PMUs,  which  could  have  led  ISIL  to  reinvest  its
    resources in other areas.  He agreed that this might be  the  case  but
    the proliferation of the PMUs was  not  seen  by  the  community  as  a
    positive thing.  They regarded the PMUs as  mercenaries  who  had  been
    paid to form a paramilitary group.  What was needed was  to  bring  the
    Sunnis into the peace process.  Asked  about  Tuz  Khurmato,  Dr  Fatah
    agreed that it was a particular centre of violence in 2018 and  it  was
    suggested to him by Mr Thomann that there had been little  violence  in
    2019.  He stated that it was actually a very small area.  The  tensions
    were mostly of an ethnic nature, and were  not  security  incidents  as
    such.

89. Re-examined by Mr Bazini, Dr Fatah confirmed  that  the  population  of
    Salah al Din was in the region of 1.6 million and that more than  three
    quarters of a million people were recognised  as  being  in  need.   He
    considered what was going on Salah  al  Din  as  revenge  by  the  Shia
    militia against the Sunnis and the Kurds, as demonstrated by  the  fact
    that the name of a university had been changed.  The PMU was  not  like
    the police; they are not educated and are hard-line,  sectarian  people
    who had responded to a fatwa.  Iran relied  on  them  and  had  trained
    them.  They had narrow political and religious  views.   They  had  not
    forgiven the Sunnis and they did not like the Kurds.

90. Mr Bazini asked about ISIL's doctrinal control of  areas  in  Salah  al
    Din.  He referred Dr Fatah to the EASO report  (see  below)  and  asked
    about the areas which were under ISIL's control in  Salah  al-Din.   He
    stated that Baiji was very important because it  generated  electricity
    for the region but the areas in question were just  villages.   It  was
    significant, Dr Fatah stated, that ISIL felt able to ask for  donations
    (zaqat) in some areas of the governorate, as this meant that they  felt
    they were sufficiently significant to do so.  The EASO report suggested
    that there was significant damage to the  infrastructure,  poverty  and
    forcible eviction.  Dr Fatah stated that life had been unbearable under
    ISIL and that there was a continuing problem  with  infrastructure  but
    there was a sectarian interest in this persisting.

91. Like Dr Fatah, the EASO report highlights the  proliferation  of  armed
    groups in Salah al Din and the sectarian tensions in  the  governorate.
    Most checkpoints are controlled by the militia, together with a variety
    of security forces  like  the  Federal  Police  and  Counter  Terrorism
    Forces, most of whom do not communicate  with  each  other.   The  EASO
    report refers to  the  sectarian  tensions  in  the  area  having  been
    exacerbated by the execution by ISIL of 1700 Shia recruits in  an  army
    camp near Tikrit.  This had led to ongoing retaliatory attacks  against
    the Sunni community. A mass grave, thought to  contain  the  bodies  of
    some 157 cadets from the camp, was discovered in March 2018.  Unlike in
    other areas, there were few Sunni tribal groups who had mobilised their
    support to the PMU forces, and  this  was  attributable  to  the  Sunni
    mistrust of the Shia forces.

92. EASO reported that the Institute for the Study of War ("ISW") stated in
    October 2018 and January 2019 that ISIL had established a small control
    zone north of Baiji in Salah al Din.  In January 2019, ISIL was said to
    have 'doctrinal control' over terrain in the Makhoul Mountains of rural
    Baiji  District.   Numerous  indicators  of  social  control  had  been
    observed including prisons, judicial proceedings,  training  camps  and
    organised worship.  Also in the Shirqat and Tuz Districts ISW  were  of
    the  opinion  that  ISIL  exerted  a  great  deal   of   physical   and
    psychological pressure over populations even if it  did  not  meet  the
    definition of doctrinal control.  In those areas there  were  abandoned
    villages, the destruction of agricultural products and  infrastructure,
    repeated raids and  assassinations  which  targeted  the  local  social
    hierarchy.  The civilian population could not rely  upon  the  security
    services for  adequate  protection.  The  Hamrin  mountain  range  also
    extends through this area, and ISIL had used it to create  'vast  rural
    cave and tunnel complexes with weapon depots and foodstuffs,  providing
    a logistical lifeline stretching from Diyala to  Kirkuk  via  Salah  al
    Din.  There were thought to be between 150-200 militants  operating  in
    the areas between Salah al Din and Diyala.  The former Minister for the
    Interior suggested in July 2018 that ISIL controlled some  75  villages
    in Kirkuk, Diyala and Salah al-Din.  White Flag militants also operated
    in the area, tapping oil from pipelines in and around Tuz Khurmato  and
    the main Kirkuk-Baghdad highway.

93. The UNAMI figures for the governorate showed a steady  decline  in  the
    casualty figures from 2014 (2833 civilians killed or injured)  to  2018
    (104 killed or injured).  According to IBC, it was the governorate with
    the fourth highest  intensity,  recording  10.05  civilian  deaths  per
    100,000 in 2018, representing a marked drop from  the  2017  figure  of
    28.05 per 100,000.  The IBC recorded 69  security  incidents  in  2018,
    involving 152 civilian deaths, down from  83  incidents  involving  424
    civilian deaths in 2017.  Most incidents involved gunfire (36.2%), IEDs
    (29%) and executions (27.5%).  Suicide attacks  and  shelling  made  up
    only 4.3% and 1.4% respectively.

94. Michael Knights considered that ISIL had weakened its campaign in Salah
    al Din in 2018, with a drop from 84 attacks per month in 2017  to  14.2
    per month in 2018.  The overall  scale  of  the  local  insurgency  was
    small.  As was put to Dr Fatah in oral evidence, this  was  thought  by
    Michael Knights to be attributable to the presence of  Shia  and  Sunni
    PMU in the area. The EASO report then continued by reviewing the nature
    of the incidents experienced throughout the  year  in  2018,  including
    attacks on local security services and some attacks against  the  local
    civilian population.  EASO considered there to be a resurgence of  ISIL
    in the Hamrin mountain range, which was a destabilising factor for  the
    governorate.  Security sweeps  had  proven  ineffective  and  the  main
    problem was the lack of government presence in  the  local  areas.   In
    Hawija, Kirkuk and Tuz Khurmato, eye witnesses  stated  that  ISIL  had
    been roaming villages during the day, asking  for  zaqat  or  demanding
    information about the whereabouts of government forces.   The  security
    vacuum in Tuz Khurmato was an area of particular concern.

95. More than 238,000 individuals were displaced from within Salah al  Din,
    the majority of whom were displaced  within  the  governorate.   Nearly
    600,000 individuals had returned, mostly from  within  the  governorate
    but some  had  returned  from  Kirkuk  and  Erbil.   68%  of  displaced
    individuals had returned.  764,000 individuals were in need,  according
    to UNOCHA.  Returnees were affected by security issues and  faced  some
    degree of harsh conditions upon return.  There were  also  particularly
    high levels of  infrastructure  damage.   As  in  other  parts  of  the
    formerly contested areas, there were reports of  forced  and  premature
    returns.  Those who were perceived to  be  associated  with  extremists
    were at risk of forcible eviction on return to their homes  and  others
    had been unable to return home.  These people were  confined  to  camps
    and were poorly treated in the camps,  with  reports  of  food  and  ID
    documents being refused and sexual violence.   The  PMUs  in  the  area
    controlled the highways  and  there  were  regular  checkpoints.   Fake
    checkpoints had been set up by ISIL.

96. The final entry for the Musings on Iraq blog for Salah al Din records:

         Finally, in  Salahaddin  there  were  four  incidents  including  a
         mukhtar's house being hit by an IED, and  then  another  going  off
         when the Iraqi forces responded. Balad Air Base was also hit  by  a
         mortar. Balad is where the Iraqi air force has its  F-16  fighters.
         This range of attacks highlights the major activities of IS  as  it
         rebuilds. It is  challenging  the  local  security  forces.  It  is
         intimidating the residents in rural areas, attacking their  mayors,
         threatening them into paying taxes so the organization can put  its
         finances back together, and driving people out  of  more  and  more
         towns so those areas can be converted into bases. This is  a  major
         goal of IS because it has to train its new cadres after its massive
         losses during its defeats in Syria and Iraq. The government has not
         adequately responded to this growing threat  as  local  politicians
         and parliamentarians are constantly complaining. That's because the
         Mahdi government has  no  security,  rebuilding  or  reconciliation
         policy in the post-conflict regions of Iraq. This is not a priority
         and is allowing IS to make a comeback much  faster  than  the  last
         time.


Diyala Governorate
97. Diyala governorate lies to the east of Baghdad and borders Iran on  its
    easternmost side.  It has a population of more than 1.6 million.  It is
    ethnically diverse,  with  Arabs,  Kurds  and  Turkmen  comprising  the
    majority.  There are also Christians,  Yazidis  and  the  Ahl  al-Haqq.
    Diyala has been described as an ethno-sectarian microcosm for the whole
    of Iraq.  It has hosted insurgents since 2004 and is considered  to  be
    good territory for such groups due to its difficult  terrain  providing
    good cover from security forces.  Because of its proximity to  Baghdad,
    it is a priority for the government and the  PMU  to  exercise  control
    over the  area.   ISIL  occupied  large  areas  in  the  north  of  the
    governorate but it did not fall as  a  whole.   The  occupation,  which
    lasted for about six months, led  to  thousands  of  inhabitants  being
    displaced.  The area was  brought  back  under  government  control  in
    January 2015 and the occupation is not  thought  to  have  lasted  long
    enough to influence the underlying trends in the region.

98. In his first report, Dr Fatah stated that the ethnically  heterogeneous
    nature of Diyala makes it  amongst  the  most  unstable  areas  in  the
    country.  He assessed ISIL and other terrorist  organisations  to  have
    increased their attacks  after  their  defeat  in  January  2015.   The
    security situation continues  to  be  volatile  and  the  targeting  of
    civilians continues to be reported.  He records that  Musings  on  Iraq
    noted in October 2017 that 728 had been killed and 549 wounded during a
    period of intense fighting between government forces and  ISIL  in  the
    areas of Jalawla and Saadiyah.  This was thought to be  retaliation  by
    ISIL for losses in Ninewa.

99. Nevertheless the number of attacks in 2018 (26.2 per month) was a third
    of what it was in 2017 (79.6) per month, according to Michael  Knights.
    There were 31 targeted killings of local authority figures in Diyala in
    2018.  The residents of Khanaqin were particularly  conscious  of  ISIL
    activity around the time of the elections in spring 2018.  In  general,
    Dr Fatah considered that ISIL has been intensifying attacks in  Diyala,
    especially through shelling and shooting both  civilians  and  security
    forces, whilst the Iraqi forces had increased  its  search  operations,
    targeting ISIL hideouts  and  sleeper  cells.   Due  to  indiscriminate
    targeting by insurgent groups in the area, Dr Fatah concluded that  all
    citizens in the area face 'some level of risk'.   The  security  forces
    are also targeted, particularly at checkpoints.

100. Dr Fatah gives a list of  38  security  incidents  in  the  governorate
    between December 2017 and 29 January 2019.  Again, we do not propose to
    list these individual incidents.  Six of the fourteen incidents in 2019
    relate to the ISF discovering and taking action against ISIL  personnel
    or facilities.  The remaining  incidents  show  action  taken  by  ISIL
    militants against the security forces and authority figures and,  in  a
    number of cases, the local civilian population.

101. In response to written questions from the respondent, Dr  Fatah  stated
    that the insurgents remaining in Diyala continued to coordinate a large
    number of attacks, including the indiscriminate targeting of civilians.
     There was targeting of security personnel and strategic areas such  as
    oil installations and military bases.  The checkpoint attacks presented
    a risk for security services  and  civilians  alike.   Individuals  and
    groups including local politicians had also been targeted although this
    may  instead  have   been   attributable   to   tribal   or   sectarian
    confrontations.

102. Dr  Fatah  was  also  asked  what  effect  the  search  operations  and
    government action  against  insurgents  had  had  in  the  region.   He
    responded with a detailed account of the action of relevant  incidents,
    showing that a number of ISIL members had been arrested  and  positions
    destroyed between September 2018 and March 2019 but that ISIL  activity
    continued.

103. In oral evidence, Dr Fatah was asked by Mr Knafler to  give  some  idea
    of the change in those areas of Diyala which had previously been  under
    ISIL occupation.  He said that there were parts  of  Diyala  which  had
    been controlled by the Kurds prior to 2017 and others  which  had  not.
    Security in the Kurdish areas had been quite strong but now there  were
    regular security incidents in the governorate.   These  were  not  just
    assassinations and targeted killings, there were bombings  too.   There
    were ISIL hideouts in the mountains  and  Khanaqin  in  particular  had
    suffered.   Mr  Knafler  asked  whether  the  security  situation   and
    infrastructure was better  now.   Dr  Fatah  said  that  he  could  not
    compare.  ISIL had done a lot of damage in the area and some tribes  in
    Diyala had suffered.  ISIL was still active there but  the  target  had
    changed,  in  that  their  goal  was  to  create  chaos  by   targeting
    checkpoints and officials.

104. In answer to Mr Thomann's questions, Dr Fatah  agreed  that  Diyala  is
    ethnically diverse.  He also highlighted that it is a large governorate
    and that it is between  Baghdad  and  Iran.   He  agreed  that  it  was
    significant that the number of attacks had  reduced.   He  agreed  that
    there was generally a similar pattern of ISIL targeting their operation
    and killing relatively few civilians.  He stated that the group was now
    more selective in their attacks, as was demonstrated  by  the  examples
    given in the report.  Mr Thomann suggested to him that Iraqi forces had
    been relatively successful in finding and eradicating members  in  this
    part of the country.  Dr Fatah agreed.  He said that there  were  still
    cells, particularly in the West of the governorate, which had a  strong
    Sunni presence.  Diyala was very important to Iraq and Iran alike.   He
    emphasised that the Hamrin Mountain Ridge, about which  he  had  spoken
    previously, extended into  Diyala.   Asked  to  comment  on  the  UNAMI
    figures, which showed a fall to 142 civilian deaths in 2018,  Dr  Fatah
    noted that there had been 56 Sunni Muslims killed in Diyala in  revenge
    for the killing of ISIL members and Shia militia.  Mr Thomann asked  Dr
    Fatah to note that these events had taken place in  January  2015.   He
    agreed, and stated that ISIL's methods were different now;  they  would
    now seek out and find particular targets.  There was no doubt, however,
    that casualties were going down.

105. Re-examined by Mr Bazini, Dr Fatah was asked about  the  suggestion  by
    Michael Knights that ISIL 'ruled the night' in certain parts of  Diyala
    (and elsewhere).  He stated that these areas were close to Baghdad  and
    that it was easier for the militants to operate  at  night.   ISIL  had
    been defeated but not eliminated.  In Diyala, as elsewhere, there  were
    ethnic groups which had been distanced from the government and that was
    the basic problem in Iraq.  He explained that  militias  had  prevented
    candidates from campaigning in certain areas because this was  disputed
    territory; there was  no  democratic  infrastructure  in  Iraq,  merely
    voting.  Mr Bazini asked  about  the  reference  to  'blood  for  blood
    demands' in the EASO report, which Dr Fatah said was like a blood feud.
     The traditional tribes might have disappeared but new  groups  emerged
    with the same mentality.  This mentality spilt over into the  political
    arena also and the PUK party was really just an amalgamation of  groups
    and tribes so that they would all  benefit.   It  was  the  community's
    mentality that the family of a man with ISIL links should be  targeted,
    whether that was his wife and young baby  or  his  brother.   This  was
    preventing families from returning to their homes.  Dr  Fatah  did  not
    think that such feuds would last for generations,  although  the  whole
    family would be tarnished if a member fought for ISIL.

106. Mr Bazini asked how the fake  checkpoints,  taxes  and  ransom  demands
    described in the background material had an impact  on  civilians.   Dr
    Fatah said that it was very  difficult  for  civilians  and  for  local
    businesses, from whom money was extorted.  He said that this was not  a
    new tactic for ISIL and  that  the  funds  raised  went  to  the  local
    commander.

107. The EASO report considers the situation in Diyala at section  2.3.   It
    notes that the PMUs are particularly strong in the governorate and that
    the Iranian backed Badr Organisation  is  considered  to  be  the  main
    security actor.

108. EASO notes that ISIL was pushed back from the governorate in  2015  but
    that it was already launching attacks from the  Hamrin  mountains  long
    before the fall of Mosul in 2017, having re-established  contacts  with
    former allies.   Asymmetric attacks continue  in  Diyala  as  in  other
    governorates.  The Institute for the Study of War assesses  in  January
    2019 that a number of districts were contested, including  Khanaqin  in
    the east and Kifri.  In Diyala, there are permanently operating  attack
    cells in five areas identified by Michael  Knights  in  December  2018.
    ISW also stated in 2018 that ISIL had established  'support  zones'  in
    the rural area around Lake Hamrin (at the end of  the  Hamrin  Mountain
    Range), from where it tries to  expand  its  freedom  of  movement  and
    actively launches attacks.  In  those  areas,  ISIL  still  "rules  the
    night, meaning that key parts of the  country  have  only  really  been
    liberated for portions of each day',  Michael  Knights  was  quoted  as
    saying in December 2018.

109. It was reported that ISIL fighters operated in cells of three  to  five
    individuals. There were not thought to be more than 75 fighters in  the
    governorate.  Another source quoted  by  EASO  thought  that  they  had
    between 150 and 200 fighters deployed between Salah ah Din and  Diyala.
    Hit and run tactics, including sniper fire and fake  checkpoints,  were
    the preferred means of attack.  The  militants  had  shaved  off  their
    beards and wore normal clothes so that they could  blend  in  with  the
    rest of the population.

110. It is accepted on all sides that the UNAMI figures cited  in  the  EASO
    report contain an error for  2017,  in  which  no  civilian  deaths  or
    injuries were recorded.  The other years show 1233 killed  and  injured
    in 2014, 2131 in 2015, 437 in 2016 and 142 in 2018.  The IBC  data  for
    Diyala showed that the number of recorded incidents remained similar in
    2017 and 2018.  There were 170 security incidents in 2018,  leading  to
    265 civilian deaths.  In 2017, there were 180 incidents, leading to 276
    civilian deaths.  The intensity of the violence was  almost  the  same:
    17.1 per 100,000 people in 2017 and 16.4  per  100,000  in  2018.   The
    incidents were gunfire (49.4%), IEDs (25.9%) and executions or  summary
    killing (19.4%).

111. Those figures are to be contrasted with those of Michael  Knights,  who
    recorded a sharp decrease in security incidents  in  Diyala  from  2017
    (79.6 per month) to 2018 (26.2 per month).  Mr Knights recorded attacks
    on local authority and security figures and attacks on civilians  which
    included  killings,  kidnappings  and  destruction  of  rural   farming
    infrastructure.  Michael Knights is quoted as considering  whether  the
    decrease was due to the fact that ISIL's  brutality  had  driven  local
    Sunni tribes into partnership with the  Shia  PMF  and  Iraqi  Military
    forces, although he noted that they had to cooperate with these  groups
    in order to return to their homes in any event.  Security  attacks  had
    fluctuated in 2018 and ISIL was reported to be active  in  every  rural
    part of the governorate and it had free movement  across  Diyala.   The
    EASO report then contains a review of  the  security  incidents  across
    Diyala in 2018, which include a note of  an  increase  in  activity  in
    March 2018 and attacks on security forces and clashes between  security
    forces and ISIL in June.  Violence continued between July and September
    2018, along a crescent which stretched from Anbar in the West to Diyala
    in the east.

112. Like Dr Fatah, EASO considered the situation in Khanaqin  in  the  east
    to deserve separate consideration.  It  noted  that  the  district  was
    ethnically diverse and that a range of pressures had  been  brought  to
    bear on it during the Saddam Hussein years and thereafter.  Suburbs had
    been taken by ISIL in June 2014, but not Khanaqin  city  itself.   When
    these areas were recaptured by the (Shia)  PMU  and  the  Peshmerga  in
    2015, it was the former who took over control of the area.  This caused
    many, especially the Kurds, to flee in fear of reprisals.  Many had not
    returned.  Security was now shared between the  Iraqi  forces  and  the
    Badr  Organisation,  although  Kurdish  forces  continue  to  stand  at
    checkpoints.  A high-ranking  official  felt  that  the  withdrawal  of
    Kurdish forces had left Khanaqin vulnerable to insurgent attacks.   The
    town  of  Jalawla  has  witnessed  similar  events  resulting  in   the
    marginalisation of the Kurdish population.  Some  84  villages  in  the
    district lack the presence of security forces and there is perceived to
    be a security vacuum in Khanaqin.

113. ISIL left booby traps in the areas they left in  Diyala,  as  they  did
    elsewhere, and the time it took to detect and neutralise these  devices
    left room for ISIL to  revert  to  insurgent  tactics  in  the  region.
    Security sweeps continue across Diyala but the militants take refuge in
    the Hamrin mountains.  In February 2018, one such  sweep  discovered  a
    tunnel complex fitted with fridges  and  washing  machines  which  were
    powered by a solar grid. In June 2018, in response to the abduction and
    killing of civilians and ISF members, the ISF began a  major  operation
    but were unable to detect any militants.  The operation  was  suspended
    after two weeks.  In October 2018,  a  further  operation  led  to  the
    discovery of 40 ISIL positions in Diyala.

114. About 89,000 people remain displaced from Diyala, the majority of  whom
    have relocated within the governorate.  223,000  have  returned,  about
    80% of whom returned home from within the governorate.   UNOCHA  stated
    in November 2018 that Diyala had  319,000  people  in  need.   The  IOM
    stated that more than 36,000 families faced conditions of severity upon
    return and the governorate retains the highest proportion of  returnees
    living in high severity  conditions.       There  are  high  levels  of
    unemployment and poverty.  Forced and premature returns continue, often
    resulting in secondary displacement.  As with the other governorates we
    have considered above,  those  with  perceived  ISIL  connections  were
    frequently prevented from  returning  home  or  were  forcibly  evicted
    thereafter.  The family members of ISIL members had  been  targeted  in
    the 'blood-for-blood demands' about which Dr Fatah was asked.   A  Shia
    militia reportedly charged illegal taxes on checkpoints  in  the  area.
    ISIL had set up fake checkpoints in the area in order to kidnap  people
    for ransom or execution.

115. The Musings on Iraq blog for 8-14 June reported that:

         In Diyala there were 9 incidents. That included a gun  battle  with
         the security forces in the Sadiya district in  the  northeast,  two
         suicide bombers were killed in the center  and  east,  and  two  IS
         members were arrested for threatening  farmers  that  their  fields
         would be burned unless they paid taxes  to  the  group.  Diyala  is
         regularly the most violent province in Iraq because that's where IS
         has spent the longest time converting back to an insurgency.  Local
         politicians are always calling  for  the  government  to  do  more.
         During  the  week  parliamentarians  from  Diyala  held   a   press
         conference calling for more Iraqi forces to be deployed there.

Anbar Governorate
116. Anbar is geographically the largest governorate.  It is not a  disputed
    territory between the KRG and the GOI but it was a contested  territory
    between ISIL and the GOI.  It makes up around a third of  Iraq's  total
    area and has a population of around 1.7 million.  As a  result  of  the
    fact that large areas are desert terrain, however, it  is  one  of  the
    most sparsely populated areas.  The capital  is  the  city  of  Ramadi,
    which has a population of only around 148,000 individuals.

117. The governorate is predominantly  inhabited  by  Sunni  Arabs  and  its
    socio-political fabric is tribal and hierarchical.  Many of the  elders
    fled when Saddam Hussein was removed from power  and  new  sheikhs  who
    were willing to align with coalition forces took power. Anbar  was  the
    earliest governorate to fall under ISIL control, in January  2014,  and
    the last to  return  to  government  control  in  November  2017.   The
    military victory caused extensive destruction in the  governorate.   24
    mass graves have been discovered since the governorate  was  liberated,
    containing more than 600 bodies of civilians and ISF personnel.

118. In his first report, Dr Fatah stated that the security  and  protection
    situation remained challenging  in  Anbar.   There  had  been  fighting
    between tribal militia and the army even before ISIL  took  control  of
    70% of the territory in June 2014.  The total number of individuals who
    have returned to Anbar exceeds 1.2 million.  IED contamination  remains
    a problem and several  incidents  have  related  to  IEDs  killing  and
    injuring civilians.  There have  also  been  reports  of  booby-trapped
    houses, particularly in newly retaken areas.

119.  At  [475]-[492],  Dr  Fatah  documents  18  security  incidents  which
    occurred between December 2017 and January 2019.   A  number  of  these
    relate to the detection and destruction of ISIL capabilities but others
    document the targeting of  security  forces  and  civilians,  including
    three adults and two children in January 2019.  Dr Fatah noted that the
    presence of Shia militia in Fallujah could pose a major threat  to  the
    stability of the region.  These militia had perpetrated serious  abuses
    against Sunni civilians, who had fled to more southern parts.  Dr Fatah
    was concerned that these abuses would fuel the ethno-religious  divides
    in the area, which was already  a  support  base  for  extremist  Sunni
    groups.   Tribal  problems  had  prevented  displaced   families   from
    returning home in the region.  The wide destruction in the  region  and
    the presence of hundreds of landmines  presented  further  problems  on
    return.

120. The respondent asked no written questions of Dr Fatah about Anbar.   In
    his updating report of  21  June  2019,  however,  Dr  Fatah  dedicated
    section 3 to Anbar.  He stated that the recapturing of Raqa  ,  on  the
    border with Syria, had marked the point  at  which  Iraq  declared  the
    collapse of ISIL, at the end of 2017.  It was reported  in  April  2019
    that the security forces had intensified their operations in  the  area
    to clear the remaining ISIL members.  At the same  time,  the  ISF  had
    asked locals to steer clear of remote areas to  avoid  ISIL.   In  June
    2019, a further 1000 people returned to their  homes  in  Anbar.   Many
    refuse to return, however, due to  security  and  basic  infrastructure
    concerns.  There were reports of  forced  returns  and  camp  closures.
    Those  camps  which  remained  were  not  run  by  the  government   or
    humanitarian agencies, but by  the  PMUs.   As  in  other  areas,  some
    families with actual or perceived ISIL connections were prevented  from
    returning home.  Dr  Fatah  went  on  to  note  a  number  of  security
    incidents in the governorate before concluding that there were concerns
    about the return of ISIL to Anbar as a result of the marked increase in
    attacks since May 2019.  Some ISIL attacks  killed  civilians  but  the
    majority appear to have been targeted at members of the local  security
    apparatus.  There were many reports of  ISIL  members  being  detected,
    including one senior figure being arrested on 5 May 2019.

121. In oral evidence, Dr Fatah stated that the governorate  was  more  than
    90% Sunni.  He said that the security pattern was the same  as  in  the
    other governorates under consideration.  It was not a disputed area but
    it was a Sunni region which had been contested by ISIL for a long time.
     There were ongoing disputes between local tribes and ISIL.  Anbar  was
    also next to  Syria,  from  which  insurgents  could  enter.   Security
    incidents in the region seemed to be going down.  IED contamination was
    a problem.  It was a fair summary  to  say  that  there  were  targeted
    operations by ISIL and counter insurgency operations by the  ISF.   The
    statistic showed a reduction in the insurgency  from  the  position  in
    2014 when ISIL were in control.

122. Mr Bazini asked a number of questions about  Anbar  in  re-examination.
    Dr Fatah agreed that there were around 1.7 million residents.   He  was
    asked about the figure that there were 200,000 people displaced in  the
    region and that it contained the second most people in need.   He  said
    that this had a bad effect on stability and morale in the area,  as  it
    did in Mosul, Salah al Din and  Kirkuk.   This  was  why  international
    support was so important.  Mr Bazini asked whether  there  was  a  view
    that not enough was being done.  Dr Fatah said that this was common  to
    all the Sunni regions.  It was to be recalled that Anbar had been where
    the insurgency started, with three UK contractors being hanged  from  a
    bridge.  He had said in the last CG case that people had been prevented
    from entering Baghdad when they fled from ISIL.  They had discovered  a
    number of mass graves in the area, thought to be those who opposed ISIL
    rule, but it was still seen as a pro-ISIL area.  Most of Anbar was  now
    controlled by Iranian backed Shia militia, who were  certainly  in  all
    the cities.  The Sunni militia were treated differently to the Shia but
    the ones who were closer to power were treated rather  better.   Sunnis
    were generally not trusted in Iraq, and this was why  the  majority  of
    the mass graves were of Sunnis.  The areas described by Michael Knights
    in 2018, in which ISIL were reportedly still operating, were big areas,
    including Ramadi.

123. Mr Bazini asked why there were so many  militia  in  the  area  if  the
    groups of ISIL fighters were small.  Dr Fatah stated that they did  not
    need so many fighters but they were inefficient.  The thinking was that
    the  country  could  be  controlled  by  security  forces  rather  than
    services.  There were 120,000 men in the PUK Peshmerga and each  cleric
    would have his own army.  The PMU  were  now  legitimised  and  on  the
    government payroll but they did not report to  a  known  ministry,   Mr
    Bazini asked about a report that the PMU had been due  to  leave  Anbar
    after the declaration of victory over ISIL but had refused  to  do  so.
    Dr Fatah suggested that this was because the government  believed  that
    the militia could control the security situation  in  the  Sunni  areas
    better than any other force. There was a need to address the underlying
    problem.  There should be no need, he said, to have a Shia  militia  in
    control of an area like Kirkuk, which was Sunni and Kurdish.

124. Asked about an entry in the EASO report which suggested that  residents
    of Anbar still lived  in  fear  of  ISIL,  Dr  Fatah  stated  that  the
    situation was really not complicated.  ISIL had controlled a  third  of
    Iraq in 2014 and the international community did not know what  to  do.
    Then the international community, the PMU and the Peshmerga managed  to
    eliminate them, which had been very costly.  After that, ISIL had taken
    a different route and had undertaken a guerrilla war.   Unless  it  was
    treated as a political issue, ISIL was not going to disappear.

125. Dr Fatah confirmed that a range of different forces were in  charge  of
    the checkpoints in the region and that these made  life  difficult  for
    the population.  They would hold people  overnight.   Since  2003,  the
    issue of basic services had not been addressed.  There was not  even  a
    guaranteed electricity supply in Baghdad.

126. Echoing Dr Fatah's evidence, the EASO  report  states  that  there  are
    more than 16,000 PMU fighters in Anbar, working  alongside  ISF  forces
    including the army and the Federal Police. As with other parts  of  the
    formerly contested areas, there is a presence of Iranian backed militia
    throughout.  The Sunni tribal militias, which were formed in 2015  with
    the aim of driving out ISIL, do not have the same status  as  the  Shia
    militia.  The behaviour of some tribal  militias  was  contributing  to
    tension with the local population.

127. EASO reported that Michael Knights considered  there  to  be  areas  in
    Anbar in which ISIL retained permanently  operating  attack  cells  and
    sleeper cells.  The Iraqi government believed there to be a few hundred
    fighters, clustered in small groups.  Insurgency activities  continued,
    particularly in the rural and desert areas.  Counter  terrorism  forces
    had been deployed to prevent ISIL fighters  entering  from  Syria.  ISF
    operations to clear the  fighters  were  hampered  by  the  desert  and
    mountainous conditions.  Anbar was considered by the  US  Consulate  in
    Erbil and USAID to be one of the areas in which ISIL posed a threat  to
    civilians.

128. The UNAMI statistics on the civilians killed and injured  in  Anbar  in
    the years 2014 to 2018 are as follows: 5927 (2014), 4703  (2015),  2115
    (2016), 822 (2017) and 252 (2018).  IBC recorded a significant decrease
    in security related incidents between 2017 (170  incidents  leading  to
    761 deaths) and 2018 (46 incidents and 86 deaths).  The  intensity  per
    100,00 civilians dropped from 45.3 in 2017 to 5.1 in  2018.   Incidents
    involved IEDs (41.3%),  gunfire  (26.1%)  and  executions  and  summary
    killings only 4.3%.

129. Joel Wing reported in 2018 that insurgents largely  withdrew  from  the
    governorate in 2018 and Michael Knights suggested that the decrease  in
    activity 'may indicate a de-prioritisation  of  Anbar  by  ISIL  as  an
    attack stage at this stage of the war'.   There  followed  a  month-by-
    month examination of security incidents, including  operations  against
    ISIL in  January  and  an  increase  in  attacks  in  March.   Security
    incidents generally subsided after March and most then targeted members
    of the Iraqi forces and the PMU.   The Anbar  desert  continues  to  be
    used by ISIL sleeper cells for regrouping and planning attacks  and  it
    is difficult to maintain a security  presence  there,  or  on  the  600
    kilometre border between Iraq and Syria.  The  government  intended  to
    build a fence to keep militants out but there  were  doubts  about  the
    efficacy of such a fence.  ISIL has taken territory in Syria, including
    the entire side of one area, from which ISIL rockets strayed into Iraq.



130. The PMUs were not trusted by the local  population  and  had  committed
    human rights violations.  Anbar was the only Sunni area from which  the
    PMU had yet failed to withdraw.  Anbar  continues  to  have  more  than
    201,000 people displaced, with  more  than  52k  displaced  within  the
    governorate.  IOM  has  registered  nearly   1.3   million   returnees.
    According to UNOCHA, the number of people in need  in  the  governorate
    was 1.35 million.  As with other governorates, there  was  evidence  of
    forced and premature returns and UNHCR  expressed  concerns,  including
    secondary displacement.

131. The commentary sections of Joel Wing's  most  recent  Musings  on  Iraq
    blogs sometimes omit reference  to  Anbar  altogether.   He  refers  to
    attacks in Anbar being up and down and a graph accompanying the post on
    3 May is accompanied by a comment that violence in the governorate  has
    'continuously fluctuated'.  Having stated in the second week  of  April
    that Anbar was at the centre of a new ISIL campaign,  he  suggested  in
    the first week of May  that  Anbar  was  merely  a  transit  point  for
    militants entering from Syria.  In his 1-7 June blog,  he  referred  to
    Anbar as being a 'secondary front for the  Islamic  State  right  now',
    although he describes a number of  attacks  on  security  and  civilian
    targets in the governorate, including significant car bomb  attacks  in
    Qaim and Haditha in the fourth week of May.

Baghdad and the Baghdad Belts
132.  Baghdad  governorate  is  the  smallest  but  most  populous,  with  a
    population of 8.1 million in 2018.  The outlying areas of Baghdad City,
    where it shares a border with Diyala, Anbar, Salah al Din and Babil are
    known as the Baghdad Belts.  The population  of  Baghdad  is  Shia  and
    Sunni, with a number of Christian  communities.   Baghdad  was  heavily
    affected by sectarian conflict in the  aftermath  of  Saddam  Hussein's
    removal and neighbourhoods which were previously mixed became much more
    segregated along religious lines.

133. In his first report, Dr Fatah stated that Baghdad remained one  of  the
    main centres of violence in Iraq and  the  risk  to  all  civilians  in
    Baghdad is high.  He gave nineteen examples of security incidents which
    had occurred in the capital between 1 January 2018 and 21 January 2019,
    the majority of which  involved  explosions  which  killed  or  injured
    civilians.

134. The respondent asked Dr Fatah in writing to provide figures  indicative
    of any trend for violent incidents in  the  central  area  and  in  the
    Baghdad Belts in the period since 2017.  He answered with  a  table  he
    had compiled using data from Musings on Iraq, showing that  the  number
    of casualties in Baghdad had declined from 932 in January 2017 to 10 in
    March 2019 and the number of security incidents there had declined from
    184 to 4 over the same period.

135. In oral evidence, Dr Fatah touched on Baghdad  when  he  was  answering
    questions from Mr Knafler, stating that Baghdad was always  the  target
    for the insurgency because it  was  the  seat  of  government.   Cross-
    examined by Mr Thomann, Dr Fatah  stated  that  the  ethnic  makeup  of
    Baghdad City had changed after 2003, with the Sunnis  being  pushed  to
    the West of the river and the Shias occupying the  east  of  the  city.
    The part of the city which was called Sadr City was mostly Shia and was
    controlled by the cleric Muqtada al Sadr.  He stated  that  there  were
    many Kurds in Baghdad; they had been part of the  state  infrastructure
    but they had left in 2003.  The Feyli  Kurds  had  always  been  there,
    however, and they spoke Arabic and the local dialect.

136. It was suggested to Dr Fatah that Joel  Wing  described  Baghdad  as  a
    'forgotten area' to ISIL.  He accepted that this was possibly  correct,
    and that ISIL was in other places and would come to Baghdad from  areas
    like Mosul and Diyala.  He was taken to  a  report  from  Lifos  -  the
    Swedish Migration Agency - from the end of 2017, which  suggested  that
    the occasional attacks which were launched from the south and north  of
    the city were largely unsuccessful.  The report  suggested  that  there
    was a new Operations Commander in Baghdad,  who  had  focussed  on  the
    Belts, and that ISIL had withdrawn its sleeper cells from the  area  at
    the time of the Mosul offensive in October 2017. Dr Fatah stated that a
    commander would be helpful but would not be able to  do  much  if  ISIL
    were surrounding the city.  Dr Fatah was asked to comment on  the  fact
    that the Musings on Iraq blog recorded three incidents in the whole  of
    May and June.  He accepted that to be the case.   He  stated  that  the
    trend in Baghdad was the same as elsewhere in the country but that  the
    figures (of incidents and casualties) would always be higher in Baghdad
    because of the size of the population.  A  bomb  in  a  market  in  the
    capital would result in higher casualty figures than elsewhere  due  to
    the concentration of population.  Baghdad had always been a target.

137. Dr Fatah was taken to  the  EASO  report,  which  suggested  that  ISIL
    violence had more or less disappeared from  Baghdad  and  that  violent
    incidents there tended to be of a political  nature.   He  agreed  with
    that analysis.  He also agreed that the  trend  was  the  same  in  the
    Baghdad Belts, in which the figures were also diminishing.  The  trends
    were reflected in the  figures  he  had  presented  in  answer  to  the
    respondent's written questions.  Asked about the humanitarian situation
    in Baghdad, Dr Fatah said that he had spoken to people  there  and  the
    situation was more stable, which chimed with the figures he  had  cited
    from the Musings blog.  The worst thing about Baghdad was the  five  or
    six checkpoints within the city.  The situation in the Belts  was  also
    improving as the area became more clear of ISIL and they found it  more
    difficult to penetrate the city, possibly because the  PMF  was  better
    trained that the Iraqi police.  Checkpoints remained on the way between
    Baghdad and the IKR, however.

138. EASO dedicates section 2.2 of its March 2019  report  to  Baghdad.   It
    records that ISIL attacks increased dramatically in  Baghdad  in  2013,
    with Shia targets being particularly hit by  Vehicle  Borne  Improvised
    Explosive  Devices  ("VBIEDs").   The  aim  was  to   demonstrate   the
    ineffectiveness of the  Iraqi  authorities  and  to  provoke  sectarian
    divisions.  The VBIEDs continued into 2014 but the fear that ISIL would
    overrun Baghdad proved to be incorrect,  although  there  was  fighting
    between the ISF and ISIL to the west of the  city  and  gunfights  were
    reported in southern areas.  These attacks led to the  mobilisation  of
    Shia militia in Baghdad and to increased  sectarian  divisions  in  the
    city, with reports of Shia militia  killing  Sunnis.   The  large-scale
    sectarian killings which  occurred  in  2006-2007  did  not  re-appear,
    however.

139. Attacks by ISIL continued from 2013-2016, although they dropped  for  a
    few months in the early part of 2016.  They then increased in intensity
    again, and there were a number  of  mass  casualty  attacks,  including
    three simultaneous attacks on 11 May 2016 in which  93  civilians  lost
    their lives.  Mass casualty attacks  dropped  significantly  after  the
    first quarter of 2018.  There were active cells  in  the  northern  and
    western Belts but these were in hibernation following  the  significant
    losses sustained in 2017.  Baghdad had become a lower priority for ISIL
    to attack in 2018 and ISIL activity had been limited in Baghdad and the
    Belts during 2018, although the Institute for the Study of War believed
    that it was still capable of mounting attacks in the centre of  Baghdad
    from its traditional support zones in the Belts.  It was reconstituting
    as an insurgency around Baghdad.  Michael Knights was of the view  that
    there were permanently operating attack cells in Baghdad, as elsewhere,
    although he stated that, in 2018,  Baghdad had seen the 'fewest  Salafi
    jihadist terrorist attacks since 2003'.  Where there is activity, it is
    generally in the Belts and there are certain areas which  according  to
    Michael Knights were hotspot areas in which attacks were more likely to
    take place.  The safest areas tended to be those in which the ISF  were
    concentrated. Mr Knights opined that the threat of violence in  Baghdad
    has become personal and targeted as opposed to situational, of being in
    the wrong place at the wrong time.    Despite the general  downturn  in
    ISIL activity in Baghdad, it continued to target  those  who  supported
    the May 2018 elections and other authority figures.  The report gives a
    number of examples of such targeted killings in 2018.

140. The UNAMI casualty figures for Baghdad were: 7983 civilians killed  and
    injured in 2014, 12,999 (2015), 11524  (2016),  2975  (2017)  and  1214
    (2018).  The IBC recorded 392 security incidents in  Baghdad  in  2018,
    leading to 566 civilian deaths, compared with  487  incidents  in  2017
    leading to 1032 deaths.  The intensity of civilians killed per  100,000
    of the population was 7.36 in 2018, compared to 14.38  in  2017.   Most
    incidents in 2018 were gunfire (46.4%), executions and summary killings
    (30.6%) and IEDs (20.7%).   The  report  gives  examples  of  IEDs  and
    explosive attacks and armed clashes.

141. Security in Baghdad is maintained by the Iraqi  army,  the  police  and
    various PMUs.  The city  and  the  suburbs  were  generally  under  the
    control of the authorities  but  in  practice  the  authorities  shared
    control with the Shia-dominated PMUs.  The Baghdad  Operations  Command
    of the ISF was one of the best resourced.  The PMUs had  been  involved
    in criminality within  the  city  and  had  clashed  with  the  ISF  on
    occasion. Violence linked to criminal and political disputes  continues
    to occur in Baghdad and the latter  remains  the  largest  concern  for
    destabilisation  and  civilian  protection.    This   is   related   to
    competition and government formation in the wake of the 2018 elections.
     The unaccountable PMU militias  are  said  to  have  strong  links  to
    criminal gangs and it can be difficult to distinguish between the  two,
    or to attribute responsibility for security incidents.

142. Baghdad experienced a massive influx of IDPs in 2015 and 2016,  forcing
    the  authorities  to  limit  access  to  the  capital  and  to   impose
    sponsorship requirements.  As of  March  2016,  there  were  more  than
    600,000 IDPs in Baghdad.  This number was reduced to just  over  69,000
    individuals by December 2018, with the majority originating from Anbar,
    Ninewa and Babil. The majority of IDPs in  Baghdad  live  with  a  host
    family or in rented accommodation and only a minority live in camps  or
    alternative accommodation.

143. Road security inside Baghdad City is generally not  maintained  by  the
    PMUs, although they do set up ad hoc checkpoints in emergencies.  Their
    checkpoints feature mostly  outside  the  centre,  in  the  Belts.   In
    January 2018, the director of Baghdad Operations  Command  stated  that
    281 checkpoints in Baghdad had been removed and thousands  of  concrete
    blocks had been lifted.  On 10 December 2018, the fortified Green  Zone
    in the centre of the city opened to the public.

144. In his 22-28 May 2019 blog, Mr Wing  suggested  that  ISIL  had  almost
    forgotten about the capital but that a car bomb attempt suggested  that
    it was trying to attack Baghdad in order  to  stay  relevant.   In  the
    subsequent blog, he also suggested that the capital  had  been  largely
    ignored by ISIL but that there had been three incidents, one  of  which
    was serious.  In the final blog before the hearing, Mr Wing stated that
    ISIL was trying to return to Baghdad, and had hit  the  centre  of  the
    city (with a mortar) for the first time in months.

Dr Fatah - General Observations on the Situation on Iraq
145. As in his  reports,  Dr  Fatah  provided  valuable  insights  into  the
    general security and humanitarian situation in Iraq.

146. In response to questions from  Mr  Knafler  and  Mr  Bazini,  Dr  Fatah
    echoed concerns he had expressed throughout his report and in section 7
    in particular.  He emphasised that insecurity would remain in Iraq as a
    whole and in the Disputed Territories in  particular  until  a  lasting
    political solution could be found to the ongoing ethnic  and  religious
    tensions within the country.  (We note that Dr  Fatah  highlighted,  in
    particular, the disenfranchisement of the Sunnis in answer to the ninth
    of the respondent's written questions.)  There were instances of  place
    names being changed from Sunni to Shia names,  for  example.   He  said
    that these political and social issues should be in  the  mind  of  the
    Tribunal when considering the situation.  He stated  that  people  were
    not happy with the level of services provided by the  Iraqi  government
    and that there  was  significant  corruption  in  the  government,  the
    Peshmerga  and  the   PMF.    There   was   significant   international
    interference, particularly in relation to the  Iranian  influence  over
    the PMF, which was did  not  fall  under  the  Iraqi  Ministry  of  the
    Interior and had no code of conduct.  It was to be recalled,  he  said,
    that the PMF had been created after Ayatollah Sistani in Iran called in
    a 2014 fatwa for Shia Muslims to mobilise against ISIL.   Many  of  the
    population, particularly the Sunnis and the Kurds,  were  unhappy  with
    such a significant Iranian influence in the country.  For his part,  he
    did not feel that Iran was helping with Iraq's stability.  The PMUs had
    even had a say in the candidates for the  election.   There  were  many
    different militias.  He had obtained a list from Baghdad and it was  in
    his first report.  Everyone knew which PMU was most powerful  in  their
    own area

147. Dr Fatah also emphasised that there was  a  risk  of  ISIL  growing  in
    strength and  carrying  out  more  attacks,  although  he  declined  to
    speculate, in response to a direct question  from  Mr  Knafler,  as  to
    whether they would be more likely to disappear or  to  come  back.   He
    compared the situation to the Kurds under  Saddam  Hussein.   They  had
    been suppressed between 1961 and 1991 but they had  come  back.   There
    was a need, he opined, not to treat the existence of ISIL as a security
    issue but as a political one which flowed from  the  disenfranchisement
    of their Sunni support base.  He  stated  that  ISIL  had  been  'badly
    disturbed' by the final battle for Mosul but  they  had  changed  their
    modus operandi and were now selective in their targeting; they would go
    to a village and kill the  local  mukhtar,  they  would  attack  a  PMF
    checkpoint.  He felt that there was still command and control for  ISIL
    and that they had some support in some communities.

148. The situation in the Disputed Territories remained unsettled and  tense
    and the PMU were trying to bring the Peshmerga into those areas, in the
    hope that their presence would  ease  the  situation.   It  was  to  be
    recalled that there were 2.6 million refugees in the IKR.

149. The EASO and UNHCR reports highlight problems of food  poverty  and  Dr
    Fatah was asked whether these problems were more  or  less  acute  when
    ISIL controlled the Contested Areas.  He stated that the situation  was
    better now, but only in those places in which  the  infrastructure  had
    not been completely destroyed.

150. Cross-examined  by  Mr  Thomann,  Dr  Fatah  said  that  the  state  of
    different parts of the  formerly  contested  areas  varied.   A  recent
    conference had decided that $60bn was necessary to rebuild  Ninewa  but
    the other places,  including  Kirkuk,  were  not  so  bad.   There  was
    insufficient  money  to  rebuild.   Some  places  in  Diyala  had  been
    completely destroyed.  He was not able to state which towns in Iraq had
    an electricity supply but it was generally bad.

151. He agreed that the number of security  incidents  had  reduced  because
    ISIL was no longer controlling towns and cities as they had before  and
    had  switched  to  guerrilla  warfare  tactics  instead.   The  counter
    insurgency had been effective in some areas,  with  tunnels  and  cells
    destroyed.   Infrastructure  was  needed  and  people  needed   to   be
    rehabilitated  and  rehoused.   The  Yazidis  had   been   particularly
    traumatised and there were also 'ISIL' children.

152. The relationship  between  the  governments  in  Baghdad  and  the  IKR
    remained tense, with disagreements over the  Disputed  Territories  and
    oil payments continuing, although the resumption of oil exports  was  a
    very positive point.  Cooperation between the  ISF  and  the  Peshmerga
    forces was also a positive sign but what was really needed was to bring
    the Peshmerga under the control of the government of Iraq and to  train
    them.  The overall direction of travel in Iraq was a change of emphasis
    to  post-conflict  reconstruction  but  challenges   remained.    Civil
    servants in the IKR had not been paid for  some  time  and  there  were
    still problems with Internally Displaced People there.  ISIL would  not
    be completely defeated without the support  of  the  Kurds.   ISIL  had
    announced its spring and summer offensive under the title  "Revenge  of
    the Levant" but this was very na�ve of them.   They  had  not  achieved
    much.  As an insurgency, they needed to  choose  high  profile  targets
    such as Mukhtars.  The campaign had  not  really  altered  the  overall
    trend.  He did not think that they were going to  rebuild  capacity  in
    order, for example, to retake a city such as Mosul.   The  picture  was
    variable, as was shown by the Musings on  Iraq  blog,  and  one  recent
    phenomenon was ISIL burning farmers' crops

153. It remained the  case  that  the  IKR  was  'virtually  violence  free'
    despite an incident involving an attack on a government building by one
    man with a pistol.  There had been Turkish airstrikes in  the  IKR  and
    Sinjar, which was apparently targeted at the PMU.

154. Dr Fatah was asked by Mr Thomann to  comment  on  the  significance  of
    certain matters when looking to the  future.   Regarding  the  military
    defeat of ISIL in 2017, he said that this had changed the face  of  the
    group from a state actor to a "hit and go" force.  Regarding their loss
    of control over urban centres, he said that it could  work  both  ways.
    When ISIL had defined territory, it was clear where they were and  they
    could be bombed.  Now they came out and attacked and  then  hid  again.
    They did not have the same impact but they could  not  be  targeted  as
    simply.  The Iraqi authorities remained ineffective but the role of the
    PMF was to be considered.  It was a different force  now,  a  sectarian
    paramilitary organisation which had generated  its  own  problems.   He
    accepted that the PMF  made  it  more  difficult  for  ISIL  to  regain
    territory, however.  ISIL defeat in Syria was also  relevant,  although
    the situation there was complicated.  ISIL's last stronghold  had  been
    in Anbar, bordering Syria, and it made a difference that  it  had  been
    defeated in Syria.  Regarding ISIL recruitment for the future, Dr Fatah
    stated that they had been joined in the past by Sunnis  and  even  some
    Yazidis, who had taken the view (in  relation  to  the  Shias  and  the
    ongoing sectarian violence) that 'the enemy of my enemy is my  friend'.
    Dr Fatah knew people in Mosul who had thought that ISIL would  liberate
    them from Shia rule but had quickly become  unhappy  under  ISIL  as  a
    result of their extremist behaviours.  They had  lost  the  battle  for
    hearts and minds amongst the local population with this behaviour.

155. On the second day of the hearing, Dr Fatah  was  cross-examined  by  Mr
    Thomann about the humanitarian situation in Iraq.  He agreed  that  the
    epicentre of the  humanitarian  problems  was  centred  in  Ninewa  and
    Kirkuk.  He agreed with the  UN  that  the  humanitarian  response  had
    expanded in certain areas and contracted in others.  He said that sadly
    some of the IDP camps were becoming permanent and that more  needed  to
    be done.  He accepted that primary  healthcare  had  been  restored  to
    parts of Ninewa governorate and he had no intention  to  undermine  the
    efforts which were being made but it had to be recalled that there were
    2.6 million IDPs in the IKR, which had a  population  of  5.5  million.
    The number of displaced people had increased after 2017  and  what  was
    needed was a political solution.  Displacement was  a  serious  problem
    and the figures did not  accurately  reflect  the  reality.   Dr  Fatah
    agreed that there was an increase  in  the  number  of  IDPs  when  the
    contested areas were cleared, followed by  a  reduction  in  the  total
    number.  He agreed with the assessment made by REACH[5], which was that
    the Public Distribution System ("PDS") provided food  sporadically  and
    irregularly,  with  limited  access  in  recently  retaken  areas.   He
    explained that there were people who were not reached  by  the  system.
    People were not dying in the camps; they had  a  tent.   If  it  was  a
    single individual who was sleeping rough, that  would  be  a  different
    story.  It was not easy to  say  which  people  did  not  receive  help
    although it was manifest that some did not.  He accepted that the Iraqi
    humanitarian response plan was one of  the  best  funded  globally  but
    there were always limitations.  He agreed that 42%  of  the  population
    were employed, noting that  65%  lived  in  families.   The  figure  of
    unemployment amongst IDPs was high; in the camps he had  visited,  many
    of the boys worked in the local town but other camps were in the desert
    and they were not able to access the local labour market, whether as  a
    result of distance or curfew.  There  was  no  possibility  of  an  IDP
    working if they lived in the Baharka Camp in Erbil, for example.

156. Dr Fatah was asked about the parts  of  his  report  in  which  he  had
    identified personal characteristics giving rise to increased risk.   He
    explained that a Sunni Kurd would face as much  additional  risk  as  a
    Sunni Arab.  After 2017, a Kurd might face  more  questioning  in  Iraq
    proper and particularly at  checkpoints  which  were  manned  by  Iraqi
    forces, who would want  to  establish  whether  he  had  any  political
    affiliations or ties to the Peshmerga.  Dr Fatah did not consider there
    to be any additional risk from having  been  out  of  Iraq,  unless  an
    individual did not have an ID or was displaying non-Islamic symbols  at
    a checkpoint, for example.  An  association  with  the  Iraqi  Security
    Forces was definitely a profile which enhanced  an  individual's  risk,
    however.

157. Dr Fatah was asked about the examples he had given of  people  who  had
    suffered problems as a result of  opposition  to  the  government.   He
    stated that the examples were in connection with the KRG, not the  GOI.
    He agreed that the most recent example he had given  was  in  2016  and
    said that  his  intention  was  to  show  the  scale  of  human  rights
    violations; there was a history of people who had  spoken  out  against
    those in power and had disappeared.   Nothing  had  happened,  although
    investigations were supposedly underway.  Politics had opened up in the
    IKR since 2009, however.  Before then it had just been the PUK and  the
    KDP but the new opposition had been effective at highlighting the human
    rights violations under the main political parties.   Dr  Fatah  agreed
    that the number of checkpoints around Baghdad had decreased but he  had
    not seen anything to suggest a reduction between Baghdad and  the  IKR;
    it remained the case that there were fixed checkpoints and that  others
    were regularly erected by various groups.

158. Asked about the support which may be available to a returnee  from  the
    family, Dr Fatah agreed with Mr Thomann that even the  extended  family
    would be likely to provide support.  Relatives could help an individual
    to find a job, for example.  Tribal connections  were  not  necessarily
    the same but being from a significant tribe like the Barzanis (who  are
    in power in the IKR) would be of assistance.

159. In re-examination, Dr Fatah was asked by Mr Bazini about the  statement
    by Michael Knights, quoted in  all  of  the  EASO  reports,  that  ISIL
    maintained permanently operating attack cells  in  27  named  parts  of
    Iraq.  Mr Bazini asked about the population of these areas.   Dr  Fatah
    said that around a million people lived in the relevant areas.  It  was
    to be recalled that sectarian tensions in  some  of  these  areas  were
    particularly high and that this might  cause  the  population  to  stay
    silent in the face of ISIL activity.  If, for example, it was  an  area
    in which a Shia militia had renamed Kurdish or Sunni  sites  with  Shia
    names, the resentment might be such that the population would  tolerate
    the  presence  of  an  ISIL  sleeper  cell.   Previously,  the  Kurdish
    population would probably have co-operated with the authorities.

160. Mr Bazini suggested to Dr Fatah that the parts of Iraq where ISIL  were
    said to 'rule the night' were actually huge.  Dr Fatah stated that  the
    areas were close to Baghdad and it was easier for ISIL  to  operate  in
    these parts at night; ISIL had been defeated but  not  eliminated.   It
    remained the situation that there were parts of the population who  had
    become distanced from the government and that  was  the  basic  problem
    with Iraq.

161. Also in re-examination, Mr Knafler asked Dr Fatah about the Musings  on
    Iraq blog.  He said that the author was an ex-teacher based in  America
    who was becoming an authority on Iraq.  He said that the  blog  was  so
    good that Mr Wing was quoted by the BBC and other agencies.  There  was
    no political view  in  the  blog  and  his  opinions  were  good.   The
    conclusion in the blog that ISIL was rebuilding was not contradicted by
    other evidence.  He had listed the events which led  Mr  Wing  to  that
    conclusion.  Asked about Mr Wing's conclusion that ISIL would manage  a
    comeback much faster than before, Dr Fatah declined to speculate as  to
    whether they might become a major military force but it might happen in
    the future.  Iraq  is  very  unstable,  he  said,  and  it  remained  a
    possibility unless the political  issues,  including  the  interference
    from Turkey and Iran were  resolved.   Asked  directly  by  Mr  Knafler
    whether ISIL would rise again in the near future, Dr Fatah said that he
    could not tell.

162. We asked some questions of Dr Fatah.  He confirmed that  it  was  usual
    for commentators on Iraq to include incidents in which  ISIL  equipment
    and personnel had been detected as 'security incidents'.   Equally,  it
    was usual for commentators on  Iraq  to  include  within  the  casualty
    figures for a given month the deaths of those found in mass  graves  in
    that month.  There had been 52 individual  mass  graves  discovered  in
    Shangal (Sinjar), for example, and those deaths were  included  in  the
    casualty figures for the month in which the graves had been discovered.
     Other examples of mass graves being discovered were in his reports.

163. Asked about  how  the  casualty  and  security  incident  figures  were
    collected and collated, Dr Fatah stated that Joel  Wing  collected  his
    figures from media outlets, by reading the reports of  incidents  on  a
    daily basis and counting the number of  casualties.   There  were  also
    official figures kept by the Iraqi authorities.  He emphasised that the
    numbers differed somewhat between the different sources but the  trends
    always remained the same and the commentators and the official  sources
    broadly matched.

164. Asked whether there was evidence of ISIL cells targeting  the  civilian
    population in 2019, Dr Fatah stated that a number  of  farms  had  been
    burned in 2019 and that there had been incidents of positive  targeting
    of civilians.  There was a small area in Anbar, for example, and  there
    were other areas where they demanded zaqat taxes.

165. We asked Dr Fatah whether he was able to give any idea of the  size  of
    the ISIL "sleeper cells" which were described in the evidence.  He said
    that the cells might number 3-5 individuals.  He thought that ISIL  had
    been reduced to around 10% or 25% of its former size in Iraq.

166. Dr Fatah stated that his view of Michael Knights  was  favourable.   He
    had hesitated when he was asked a question about one  of  his  opinions
    not because of the author but because of the opinion in question, which
    concerned cooperation between the  Shia  and  Sunni  PMUs.   There  was
    another point taken by Mr Knights with which he did not fully agree; he
    had suggested that the Baghdad Operations Command had  been  successful
    in reducing the number of security incidents in Baghdad but the reality
    was that it was not the commander, it was the removal of ISIL from  the
    Baghdad Belts.

167. In questions arising from our own, Mr Knafler asked Dr Fatah about  the
    number of ISIL fighters remaining in Iraq.  He stated  that  there  had
    probably been about 8000 originally and that  there  were  around  2000
    remaining; that was 'not a bad estimate'.  Asked by Mr Bazini about the
    under-reporting of casualties, Dr Fatah stated that it would always  be
    an issue in a Muslim country, in which people were required to bury the
    dead within 24 hours of their passing.  If people just went straight to
    the burial site and bypassed the media or  the  hospital,  their  death
    would not be registered.

                           SECTION C - SUBMISSIONS

168. In advance of the hearing, we received a detailed skeleton argument  on
    behalf of  all  three  appellants  and  an  equally  detailed  skeleton
    argument on behalf of the respondent.  We subsequently received closing
    written submissions on behalf of the first and  second  appellants  and
    the respondent.  We have taken each into account and  are  grateful  to
    the representatives for the clarity of the submissions presented.

169. In addition, we received an untitled document of 237 pages,  subdivided
    into 11 sections and inaccurately described in  the  first  and  second
    appellant's written submissions as 'the  Schedule'.   We  have  derived
    significantly less assistance from this  document,  which  consists  of
    substantial excerpts from various reports without any submissions other
    than those in the index (for example "evidence  of  the  categories  of
    persons who may have a well-founded fear of persecution in Iraq").   It
    is repetitious in many parts and  contains  extensive  emboldening  and
    underlining which does not appear in the original  reports.   There  is
    evidently a danger in such a document,  in  that  the  context  of  the
    passages in question is lost when they are presented  in  this  manner.
    We have read and considered the document but we  record  that  we  have
    derived significantly more assistance from the complete reports  before
    us, the evidence of Dr  Fatah,  and  the  extensive  written  and  oral
    submissions we received.

170. Mr Thomann's oral submissions on behalf of the respondent followed  the
    structure of his  excellent  written  submissions.   He  began  with  a
    summary of the respondent's case, which was as follows.  There has been
    a seismic change in Iraq.  ISIL suffered a military defeat which led to
    the implosion of its numbers and to a loss of control in the  Contested
    Areas. The correct approach was to consider whether there  was  a  real
    risk of a breach  of  Article  15(c)  now  and  also  to  consider  the
    foreseeable future.  Tensions  had  finally  eased  after  the  Kurdish
    Independence Referendum.  It remained the case that there was  internal
    armed conflict in Iraq but it had changed in character and was confined
    to rural areas.  The conflict was not of the intensity required to meet
    the threshold for Article 15(c),  although  it  remained  necessary  to
    consider the individual circumstances of a claimant in order  to  apply
    the sliding scale approach in Elgafaji.  ISIL's strategy  had  changed,
    and that had not been a change made by choice.  Amongst  other  factors
    which bore on the extent of the risk from ISIL was the presence of  the
    PMU in Iraq.  It was accepted by the respondent that a role  needed  to
    be found for these militia but the reality on the ground was that their
    presence had  narrowed  ISIL's  capabilities.   Overall,  there  was  a
    durable and well established change in the security situation.

171. Mr Thomann encouraged the Tribunal to consider the  relevant  areas  of
    Iraq individually but he submitted that such consideration should  lead
    to the conclusion that the Article 15(c) threshold was not  crossed  in
    any part of Iraq.  Anticipating a submission which was to  be  made  by
    the appellants, he submitted that there  was  no  foreseeable  risk  of
    ISIL's resurgence.  Whilst certain  individuals  might  be  at  greater
    risk, and certain areas might present a greater risk to an  individual,
    it was  the  respondent's  position  that  individuals  could  relocate
    internally within Iraq, either to the IKR (in the case of Kurds) or  to
    Baghdad (in the case of Sunni or Shia Arabs).

172. The concession which was made at [93] of AAH (Iraq)  -  that  returnees
    without support who were not in possession of  a  CSID,  and  who  were
    unable to obtain one, would face a real  risk  of  destitution  in  all
    parts of Iraq  such  that  Article  3  ECHR  would  be  engaged  -  was
    maintained but the evidence available to the Tribunal on this issue was
    far wider than had been considered in the past.  Individuals  could  be
    returned to Baghdad or to Erbil.  The respondent now relied on evidence
    to show that a Laissez Passeror a certification letter  could  be  used
    for internal travel, for example.  Dr Fatah  had  also  given  evidence
    about the circumstances in which other forms of ID might be acceptable,
    including  professional  ID  cards.   In  any  event,  the   respondent
    submitted that an individual without a CSID would frequently be able to
    obtain a replacement from the Central Registry in Baghdad.

173. The situation which presently obtained in Iraq  was  to  be  contrasted
    with that which obtained when the previous country guidance was issued.
     The high point of the indiscriminate violence had  been  in  2014  and
    there had been a very significant reduction to the current levels.   It
    was also to be recalled that the country  guidance  in  AA  (Iraq)  was
    issued at a time when ISIL were in control of tracts of Iraq and Ramadi
    had fallen shortly before the hearing in that case.  Now, there was  no
    area in which  ISIL  could  hold  occupational  control.   They  had  a
    presence in some rural locations but there was no  particular  area  in
    which it could rebuild.   Dr  Fatah  had  stated  that  rebuilding  the
    insurgency would be easier for them if they had control of  a  specific
    area.  The improvements were not  limited  to  the  formerly  contested
    areas; Baghdad and the Belts had  been  essentially  cleared  of  ISIL.
    Shelling had reduced across Iraq and  civilians  were  returning.   The
    safety and feasibility of internal relocation to Baghdad  and  the  IKR
    had been considered in AA (Iraq) and AAH (Iraq) and, broadly  speaking,
    the respondent did not ask the Tribunal to revisit those findings.   It
    was accepted that those  without  family  support  would  face  a  real
    challenge.   It was clear that IDP camps were not previously  available
    and that some had been closed down.  The most significant consideration
    in respect of internal relocation was likely to be  whether  there  was
    support from friends or family.  Concern had previously been  expressed
    about so called 'critical shelter arrangements' and individuals without
    a CSID would clearly be in difficulty.  The respondent did not seek  to
    go behind the concession made in AAH (Iraq).   Generally,  however,  it
    was a relatively straightforward process to obtain a replacement  CSID.



174. Mr Thomann submitted  that  there  was  no  real  dispute  between  the
    parties regarding the substantive law on Article 15(c).  The origin  of
    the provision was to be borne in mind and was highlighted in QD (Iraq).
     It was obviously common ground that the  sliding  scale  applied.   In
    relation to Article 3 ECHR, however, the bar was set very high when  it
    was submitted that removal would be contrary to that article on account
    of conditions in the receiving  state.   Equally,  there  was  no  real
    dispute between the parties about the  correct  approach  to  departure
    from or modification of existing  country  guidance.   Observations  in
    cases such as SG (Iraq) [2012] EWCA Civ 940; [2013] 1 WLR 41  resonated
    with less force in a case which had been set down for country guidance.
     Ultimately, the question was whether the changes were well established
    and durable.  As to the  foreseeability  of  future  risk,  Mr  Thomann
    adopted what had been said by Eleanor Grey for the Secretary  of  State
    in EM (Zimbabwe) CG [2011] UKUT  98  (IAC):  the  more  remote  a  risk
    becomes, the more difficult it is to satisfy the 'real risk' test.

175. It had been submitted in writing by the  appellants  that  it  was  not
    appropriate  to  rely  on  country  information  in  the   respondent's
    publications.  That submission was ill founded, however, and  documents
    such as Country  Policy  and  Information  Notes  were  not  driven  by
    government policy.  Such  notes  merely  drew  together  a  variety  of
    sources in a helpful way. The limitations of such notes were  apparent,
    however, and the respondent urged the Tribunal to consider the evidence
    as a whole.

176. Mr Thomann submitted that it was instructive to consider the  situation
    from the end of 2017 onwards.  Hundreds  of  thousands  of  people  had
    returned home from that point onwards and  the  focus  of  the  present
    Prime Minister was on the reconstruction  of  his  country.  Whilst  it
    remained the case that ISIL was responsible for civilian deaths, it had
    a much reduced ability to  cause  mass  casualties  and  December  2018
    represented the lowest period on record.   The  exact  number  of  ISIL
    fighters remaining in Iraq was obviously  unknown  but  the  respondent
    commended the figures preferred by Dr Fatah and Hisham al-Hashimi, both
    of whom suggested that the numbers were in the hundreds.  Those numbers
    were to be compared to what Dr Fatah had said about  the  size  of  the
    other military actors in the country.  The reduction in the  number  of
    ISIL fighters was not the only change; their  methods  had  changed  as
    well.  They remained in the Hamrin Mountains and other such places  and
    they chose their targets carefully.  The recent posts on the Musings on
    Iraq blog showed that the Return of the Levant  campaign  had  come  to
    nothing and that counter insurgency was  effective.   In  summary,  the
    position had changed fundamentally since AA (Iraq) in 2015;  challenges
    remained but there was no longer a degree of risk which engaged Article
    15(c) anywhere in Iraq.

177. There had been an interregnum period  after  the  Kurdish  Independence
    Referendum but the situation had not resulted  in  armed  conflict  and
    there was a more settled period in the Disputed Territories as a whole.
     ISIL was finding it more difficult to operate.   The  trend  was  that
    tensions between the IKR and the GOI were lessening and there was  some
    military co-operation between their forces.  There was  some  criticism
    of the PMUs and there  were  particular  problems  in  places  such  as
    Kirkuk, from which Dr Fatah thought they should retreat.  Despite these
    concerns, it was clear that the impact of the PMUs on security in  Iraq
    had been beneficial overall.  Dr Fatah had not  stated  that  ISIL  was
    likely to resurface and that was unlikely  to  be  the  case.   It  was
    particularly difficult to recruit foreign assistance when dependent  on
    sleeper cells.  The state forces were now entirely  different  and  the
    counter insurgency had been successful.   And  the  experience  of  the
    population living under ISIL was  to  be  remembered.   Those  who  had
    experienced life under  ISIL  were  unlikely  to  support  them  again.
    Whilst the group had not been eradicated, the  security  situation  was
    not presently such as to generate a general risk  under  Article  15(c)
    and would not be in the future.

178. Before turning to the specific areas under  consideration,  Mr  Thomann
    noted that it was to be suggested by Mr Bazini that there were  swathes
    of territory which remained  either  ISIL  control  or  in  which  they
    instilled fear in the population.  Whilst this was factually correct in
    respect of certain areas, even the situation in  those  areas  was  not
    shown to engage Article 15(c) generally.  There was no  area  in  which
    ISIL could regroup and the authorities had generally maintained a 'foot
    on the throat' of the insurgents.

179. In  relation  to  Kirkuk,  Mr  Thomann  submitted  that  tensions  were
    apparent but  the  general  situation  had  improved  and  attacks  had
    continued  to  fall.   There  was  little  infrastructure  damage.  The
    majority of attacks had happened  since  the  Referendum  and  targeted
    military personnel.  Many IDPs had returned and British  Petroleum  had
    returned to Kirkuk's oil fields, demonstrating returning confidence  in
    the area.

180. In relation to Ninewa, this had previously been the epicentre  of  ISIL
    and there were many humanitarian considerations.  Mosul and Sinjar were
    particularly of concern and any decision maker considering  the  return
    of an individual to either place would need to assess their  home  area
    and personal characteristics with great care.  That  said,  east  Mosul
    had returned  to  normal  life  surprisingly  quickly.   Infrastructure
    challenges plainly remained, particularly in relation to Mosul but  the
    circumstances there did not engage Article  15(c)  when  the  level  of
    security incidents and the presence of  ISIL  was  at  present  levels.
    Even recalling the sliding scale, it was not likely that an  individual
    would be able to show an Article 15(c) there.

181. As to Salah al Din, Mr Thomann submitted that ISIL  had  been  weakened
    in this governorate to the point of becoming anaemic.   They  had  been
    limited by the PMUs.  Tuz Khurmato and Sinjar  are  in  Salah  al  Din,
    however, and these are areas of particular concern.  As with Mosul  and
    Hawija, it was necessary to consider the appeals  of  individuals  from
    those areas with particular care.  Violent incidents in those areas had
    continued into 2018 but they had recently decreased  significantly  and
    the most recent incidents of note were in 2018.

182. Diyala had been an area of significant success for the  ISF,  with  the
    number of attacks decreasing from 79.6 in 2017 to 26.2 in  a  month  in
    2018.  Sleeper cells remained but the  risk was greatly reduced.

183. Dr Fatah's evidence in respect of Anbar  was  accepted.   Whilst  there
    had been a steady decrease in ISIL activity, that was initially less so
    in Anbar, although there was a reduction by 2019.  It  was  instructive
    to consider the weekly trends in the 2019 Musings on Iraq blog with the
    figures given by Dr Fatah for previous periods.

184. The Baghdad Belts had obviously improved; Dr Fatah had been very  clear
    regarding  the  reduction  of  ISIL  presence  in  the  Belts  and  the
    improvements it had brought to the area. Security  barriers  and  blast
    protection was being removed in Baghdad.  It was correct to  note  that
    there had been promises made by the incoming Prime Minister  and  these
    steps may be part of his attempt to keep  those  promises  but  it  was
    likely to be more than that and to signal real change.

185. The appellants submitted that certain  categories  of  individual  were
    more susceptible to risk on the sliding scale and the  categories  were
    essentially agreed.  There had been real changes in  respect  of  those
    who were perceived to have an association with ISIL, however, and there
    were no longer reports of Sunni males disappearing or suffering serious
    ill treatment  at  checkpoints.   The  respondent's  primary  position,
    however, was that there was no part  of  Iraq  in  which  there  was  a
    general  risk  of  conditions  which  breached  Article  15(c)  of  the
    Qualification Directive.

186. It was clear, and the respondent accepted, that there  were  particular
    humanitarian challenges in certain  geographical  areas.   The  UNHCR's
    guidance was particularly  valuable  in  this  regard.   There  were  a
    variety of international actors providing humanitarian  assistance  but
    the situation was challenging in areas such  as  Mosul  in  particular.
    Nevertheless, in light of the very high threshold for  there  to  be  a
    breach of Article 3  ECHR  by  reason  of  country  conditions  in  the
    receiving state, that threshold would not generally be reached  in  the
    case of a documented failed asylum seeker.

187. As to relocation, this had not been a particular focus  for  Dr  Fatah.
    The enquiry  of  whether  it  would  be  reasonable  for  a  particular
    individual to relocate was intensely fact specific.   The  respondent's
    general position  was  that  the  conclusions  in  the  extant  country
    guidance decisions should be affirmed  in  relation  to  relocation  to
    Baghdad  and  the  IKR.   The  respondent  recognised  that  there  was
    potentially a need for a letter of support from a local mukhtar  before
    an individual would be  permitted  to  settle  in  a  particular  area.
    Cities other than Baghdad and those in the IKR were potentially  viable
    places of relocation but Dr Fatah's evidence should  be  considered  in
    that regard.  In particular, it would be important to consider  in  any
    such place of relocation whether there was support  available,  whether
    from nuclear or extended family or friends and  tribal  connections  to
    the area.  In the event that family was present  in  such  a  location,
    support would probably be forthcoming.   Tribal  connections  were  not
    necessarily  as  dependable  but  might  be  counted  on,  in   certain
    circumstances, in order to  provide  employment  opportunities.  Again,
    however, Mr Thomann underlined the respondent's  acceptance  that  some
    areas in Iraq remain particularly challenging.

188. As to documentation, Mr Thomann submitted that  individuals  needed  to
    be able to establish their identity and that it was not only  the  CSID
    that was able to serve that purpose.  It was important,  in  any  given
    case, to consider  whether  an  individual's  identity  could  also  be
    established by family connections.  Dr Fatah had also  explained,  with
    reference to his sister (a judge in Sulaymaniyah), that it  might  also
    be possible to travel in Iraq using an alternative form of ID such as a
    professional ID card. That evidence  tallied  with  the  evidence  upon
    which the respondent relied, which was to the  effect  that  a  Laissez
    Passer or a 'certification letter' could be used for onward travel from
    Baghdad to other areas of the country. It was accepted on the  part  of
    the respondent that there was no empirical evidence of  such  documents
    being used but there was no evidence to  the  contrary  effect  either.
    The respondent's evidence was to be considered  in  the  round,  noting
    that Dr Fatah had not heard of such documents being  used.   Considered
    in the round, however, the respondent had provided cogent evidence that
    such documents could be used for onward travel.  It would be  submitted
    by the appellants that Laissez Passers or certification  letters  would
    be unacceptable at checkpoints and it was accepted that these could  be
    manned by various armed actors.  The CSID  was  not  the  indispensable
    prerequisite for passing through checkpoints, however, and  Dr  Fatah's
    evidence did not exclude the possibility that an  individual  could  be
    permitted to pass using alternative documents.

189. As regards the acquisition of new  identity  documents,  it  was  clear
    that records were held in a national database.  There were  300  or  so
    family registry offices around the country.  The Tribunal would wish to
    consider the evidence about the roll out of the new INID.  Dr Fatah had
    said that it was to be compulsory  by  the  end  of  2019  and  he  had
    understandably based his conclusions on discussions with a  lawyer  and
    his own experience.  The other background material suggested,  however,
    that the implementation process was proceeding  more  slowly  and  that
    CSID documents were still being issued and used.  That was  indeed  the
    evidence of the Iraqi authorities  themselves.   The  significance  was
    that the CSID could be obtained  'remotely'  whereas  the  INID,  which
    required iris and fingerprint scans, could not.  In  practice,  it  was
    the respondent's submission that most individuals would  not  encounter
    difficulty in obtaining replacement identity documents.

190. As for the individual  appellants,  SMO  and  KSP  were  in  relatively
    advantageous positions regarding the availability  of  family  support.
    SMO would be returning to southern Kirkuk and there was  no  reason  to
    believe  that  he  would  encounter  any   particular   difficulty   in
    demonstrating his identity en route.  KSP would  be  returning  to  his
    family, who remained in Tuz Khurmato.  There was no suggestion that  he
    would have any difficulty in returning there.

191. For the first and second appellants, Mr Knafler highlighted that  their
    written submissions had been amended to take account of Dr Fatah's oral
    evidence.  He sought  to  amplify  the  following  points.   The  legal
    framework was agreed with the respondent and the appellants  were  also
    in agreement with the point inserted at [51] of  Mr  Thomann's  closing
    submissions regarding the correct approach to potential changes in  the
    country situation in light of EM (Zimbabwe).

192. As to documentation, Mr Knafler  submitted  that  the  current  country
    guidance should be maintained but  that  it  needed  supplementing  and
    updating in relation to the INID.  The appellants' position in relation
    to the letters from the Iraqi authorities and the other material  which
    had been deployed initially in R (on the application of  SS  (Iraq))  v
    SSHD [2019 EWHC 1402 (Admin) was that it had no doubt  been  given  and
    gathered in good faith  but  it  was  so  wholly  inadequate  that  the
    Tribunal could not properly place any weight  on  it.   The  respondent
    sought to attach significance to a statement made by the Baghdad  Chief
    of Police to one of her officers (Ms Drew) but there was  nothing  from
    the  Chief  of  Police  himself  and  Dr  Fatah   had   described   his
    pronouncement that a certification letter would be adequate  to  ensure
    safe passage beyond Baghdad as a "political statement".

193. The need for documentation remained and it  had  not  been  established
    that either a Laissez Passeror a certification  letter  would  suffice,
    although Dr Fatah had suggested that an  individual  might  be  allowed
    (depending on the officer at the airport) to make contact with a family
    member in order to  obtain  documentation.   It  was  to  be  recalled,
    however, that many IDPs do not have official documents because  of  the
    reasons which led to their displacement and the UNHCR  had  made  clear
    that there was a real issue in Iraq about  people  not  being  able  to
    obtain replacement documents.  It was also  to  be  recalled  that  the
    respondent accepted that an individual without access  to  a  CSID  and
    without support would be in  grave  difficulty,  as  confirmed  by  the
    recognition that the return of the third appellant to Iraq would breach
    Article 3 ECHR.

194. In relation to the risk of conditions contrary to Article 15(c) in  the
    formerly contested areas, Mr Knafler submitted that it was  significant
    that the UNHCR recognised in its May 2019 guidelines  that  individuals
    from those areas may be deserving of subsidiary protection.  Those  who
    were at risk of such treatment in their home areas  had  either  no  or
    very scant chance of relocation.  Again, there was nothing between  the
    parties on the correct legal approach  to  the  assessment  of  Article
    15(c) in those areas.  There  was  a  vast  amount  of  evidence  which
    required  careful  assessment  but  the  first  and  second  appellants
    commended the approach of the UNHCR.

195. At [44]-[48] of his written submissions,  Mr  Knafler  had  highlighted
    categories of those who might be at risk under the  Refugee  Convention
    or at 'special  risk'  under  Article  15(c).   The  breadth  of  those
    categories was significant for two  particular  reasons.   Firstly,  it
    could not sensibly be submitted that  the  situation  in  the  formerly
    contested areas was stable when such a number of groups were  at  risk.
    Secondly, there must come a point when the risk to different groups  of
    individuals merged into a risk of indiscriminate violence under Article
    15(c).  It was clear that the areas in question remained febrile.  When
    pressed, Dr Fatah had accepted quite  clearly  that  the  situation  in
    these areas was better.  He emphasised, however,  that  the  areas  had
    returned to a situation of high sectarian tension as a result of a Shia-
    led and Shia-imposed military  solution.   Dr  Fatah  had  consistently
    returned to that high-level analysis  and  to  his  conclusion  that  a
    durable solution had not  been  achieved.   ISIL  had  been  militarily
    defeated but there were still 'hit and go' attacks in these  areas.   A
    number of these attacks and extortion  attempts  were  on  agricultural
    infrastructure, affecting the livelihoods of farmers.  Dr Fatah had, in
    re-examination by Mr Bazini, highlighted the ongoing activities of ISIL
    and the extent to which it can be said to exercise control over certain
    areas.  He had guessed  that  there  were  up  to  2000  ISIL  fighters
    remaining in Iraq, which was a serious number and a serious threat.  He
    had not been prepared  to  say  that  they  were  about  to  return  to
    prominence but he had accepted the views expressed in  that  regard  in
    the Musings on Iraq blog.  The root  causes  for  ISIL  rising  in  the
    region remained and it mattered not whether ISIL would  rise  again  or
    whether another group would rise to  prominence.   The  clear  analysis
    underpinning all of Dr Fatah's evidence  was  that  the  situation  was
    precarious and  uncertain  and  that  the  root  cause  for  insurgency
    remained.  Without a political solution, there was  a  real  risk  that
    such groups would resurface, as had the PKK in Turkey.

196. Dr Fatah had not considered the humanitarian situation in  great  depth
    in his reports and he had essentially accepted all  propositions  which
    were  put  to  him  in  cross-examination   and   re-examination.    He
    particularly endorsed the views of the UNHCR, which  the  Tribunal  was
    invited to adopt.

197. Mr Bazini adopted Mr Knafler's submissions  and  added  the  following.
    It was submitted by the respondent that the military defeat of ISIL and
    the diminishing figures for security incidents and civilian  casualties
    meant that the Article 15(c) was no longer reached in  respect  of  the
    formerly contested areas but this was an unprecedented situation for  a
    country guidance assessment.  There had previously been  an  acceptance
    on the part of the respondent and the Tribunal  that  there  were  vast
    areas of Iraq in which such a general risk existed and now it was  said
    that no such risk  existed.   There  was  plainly  a  need  for  cogent
    evidence to substantiate such  a  conclusion.   It  was  necessary,  in
    considering the extent of the risk, to  adopt  the  inclusive  approach
    described  in  the  authorities  and  to   consider   qualitative   and
    quantitative indicators.   Mr  Bazini  commended  the  approach  of  Mr
    Fordham QC in HM (Iraq), at [114], in which he had  submitted  that  it
    was relevant to consider the extent to which people  lived  'under  the
    shadow of violence'.

198.  It  was  the  appellants'  position  that  some  areas  were  properly
    described as contested, and they drew support from EASO, the  Institute
    for the Study of War and Michael Knights in that submission.  In  those
    areas which were still said to be contested, there was  necessarily  an
    Article 15(c) risk solely on account of a civilian's presence  in  that
    area.  There were also attack  cells  which  covered  large  areas  and
    places in which ISIL were said to 'rule the  night'.   Again,  adopting
    the  holistic  and  inclusive  approach  which  was  required  by   the
    authorities, it was likely that a  general  risk  under  Article  15(c)
    existed in those places as well. There were also areas in which sleeper
    cells existed and operated.  Mr Bazini submitted that there was a  non-
    exhaustive list of factors which fell to be considered pursuant to  the
    inclusive approach.  The size of the IDP issue had been highlighted  by
    Dr Fatah and returns from  the  United  Kingdom  would  only  serve  to
    compound that issue. Individuals had already been returning from  their
    places of relocation and the reports showed that secondary displacement
    was  a  concern.   Large  amounts  of  people  were  living  in  severe
    conditions.  Returnees were sadly living in  fear  of  retribution  for
    perceived  association  with  ISIL.   There  had   been   extraordinary
    disruption to the infrastructure of the country and the $30 US  billion
    that had been injected appeared not  to  have  made  a  great  deal  of
    difference.  Unprecedented amounts of  unexploded  ordinance  remained.
    Large numbers of people remained in need of  humanitarian  aid.   There
    were serious issues with agriculture, not least the fact that ISIL were
    now seeking to target farms and farmers.  That only served to  compound
    a problem which had been identified in  AAH,  which  was  that  it  was
    necessary for Iraq to import large quantities of food.

199. Mr Bazini submitted that a vacuum had been left  by  ISIL  and  it  had
    been filled by large militias which were a threat in  themselves.   The
    population were hostile towards them in any areas and vice versa.  They
    were guilty of extortion and of criminal activity and they  were  known
    to have links to Iran.  They perpetrated violence against  the  Sunnis.
     The background material showed that these PMU militias were  all  over
    Iraq  and  were  filling  the  security  void  whilst  frightening  the
    population and extorting money from them.  The  PMU  are  unaccountable
    and were, in reality, a  law  unto  themselves  who  viewed  the  local
    population as nothing more than a piggy bank.

200. It remained the  case  that  there  was  a  very  real  danger  at  the
    checkpoints which proliferated around the country.   Those  which  were
    manned by armed PMU brought with them a risk of extortion at  the  very
    least.  Those which were set up by ISIL  brought  considerably  greater
    risks.  Dr Fatah had spoken about 'blood for blood' retribution,  which
    was the type of phenomenon  which  had  disappeared  under  the  brutal
    regime of Saddam Hussein but had re-emerged latterly.   The  increasing
    involvement of international forces, including Iran and  Turkey  was  a
    source of further concern. Violence clearly flared at elections  times.
    Even if the overall numbers of incidents and casualties had fallen, the
    picture was to be considered holistically.  It could not be  said  that
    the contested areas were functioning properly.  The situation  remained
    very  unpleasant  in  those  areas  and  the  population  was   greatly
    traumatised.  The changes were not durable and the situation was likely
    to get worse because the government was allowing the  militia  to  take
    hold.  The UNHCR was clear that various groups were at risk,  including
    the LGBT community.  It was, in summary, premature to conclude that the
    situation had changed to the point that Article 15(c) no longer applied
    throughout the formerly contested areas.

201. As regards the documentation issues, Mr Bazini also  adopted  what  had
    been said by Mr Knafler.  The fact that leave was to be granted  to  IM
    suggested that the respondent  did  not  have  confidence  in  his  own
    position.  If, as  the  respondent  sought  to  suggest,  records  were
    centrally held and would enable him to obtain a new CSID,  why  had  it
    been accepted that this appellant could not obtain one?  As HHJ Coe  QC
    had held in R (SS(Iraq)) v SSHD, there was very little evidence to show
    that microfilm records were accessible.  The Deputy  High  Court  judge
    had  reached  a  logical  conclusion  on  the  same  evidence  and  the
    respondent had chosen not to take  matters  any  further  evidentially.
    (Mr Thomann confirmed, in answer to our question, that  the  respondent
    had not sought to obtain an example of a certification letter.)

202. In considering the  respondent's  submission  that  the  staff  at  the
    airport in Baghdad would issue a certification letter, it was  relevant
    to note that Amnesty International had not heard of  such  a  document.
    These documents were not said to hold  any  legal  status  and  it  was
    illogical to consider that they would be recognised and accepted at the
    checkpoints which were manned by a  selection  of  armed  actors.   The
    respondent was clutching at straws when she relied  on  the  submission
    that professional ID documents might suffice.

     SECTION D - THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK (Article 15(c) and Article 3 ECHR)

 i) Article 15(c)
203. As we have stated above, our enquiry in  these  cases  is  confined  to
    Article 15 of the Qualification  Directive  and  Article  3  ECHR.  The
    Refugee Convention does not fall for consideration due to the  findings
    which have been preserved in the individual  appeals.   Other  decision
    makers will wish  to  recall  the  instruction  at  [154]-[156]  of  AK
    (Afghanistan) CG [2012] UKUT 163 (IAC), however,  and  to  ensure  that
    questions  of   subsidiary   protection   are   only   resolved   after
    consideration of any entitlement under the Refugee Convention.

204. Article 2(e) of the Qualification Directive defines a  person  eligible
    for subsidiary protection as "a third country national or  a  stateless
    person who does not qualify  as  a  refugee  but  in  respect  of  whom
    substantial grounds have been  shown  for  believing  that  the  person
    concerned, if returned to his or her country of origin, or in the  case
    of a stateless person,  to  his  or  her  country  of  former  habitual
    residence, would face a real risk of suffering serious harm as  defined
    in Article 15, and to whom Article 17(1) and (2) do not apply, and is
    unable, or, owing to such risk, unwilling to avail himself  or  herself
    of the protection of that country."

205. Article 15 of the Qualification Directive provides as follows:

    Serious harm consists of
     a) Death penalty or execution
     b) Torture or inhuman  or  degrading  treatment  or  punishment  of  an
        applicant in the country of origin
     c) Serious and individual threat to a  civilian's  life  or  person  by
        reason of indiscriminate violence in situations of international  or
        internal armed conflict.

206. It is for the appellants to show that  there  are  substantial  grounds
    for believing that there is a real risk of such treatment.   No  issues
    arise under Article 15(a) in these cases.  Article 15(b) is essentially
    coterminous with Article 3 ECHR: Elgafaji, at  [28].   In  relation  to
    Article 15(c), the leading European  authorities  remain  Elgafaji  and
    Diakite v Commissaire g�n�ral aux r�fugi�s et aux apatrides (C-285/12);
    [2014] 1 WLR 2477 and the leading domestic authority remains QD (Iraq).
     Whilst the CJEU  has  more  recently  had  occasion  to  consider  the
    procedural protections inherent in Article 15  (in  M  v  Minister  for
    Justice and Equality (C-560/14); [2017] 3 CMLR 2), the substantive  law
    remains as it was at the time of  MOJ  (Somalia)  CG  [2014]  UKUT  442
    (IAC).  At [31]-[33] of that decision, the Upper Tribunal extracted the
    following principles from the leading authorities:


    [31] In Elgafaji, the ECJ construed Article15(c) as dealing with a more
         general risk of harm than that  covered  by  15(a)  and  (b).   The
         essence of the Court's ruling in Elgafaji was:


         (43) Having regard to all  of  the  foregoing  considerations,  the
             answer to the questions referred is that Article 15(c) of  the
             Directive, in conjunction with Article 2(e) of the  Directive,
             must be interpreted  as  meaning  that:  the  existence  of  a
             serious and individual threat to the  life  or  person  of  an
             applicant for subsidiary protection  is  not  subject  to  the
             condition that that  applicant  adduce  evidence  that  he  is
             specifically targeted by reason of factors particular  to  his
             personal circumstances; the existence of  such  a  threat  can
             exceptionally be considered to be established where the degree
             of indiscriminate violence characterising the  armed  conflict
             taking place assessed by the  competent  national  authorities
             before which an application for subsidiary protection is made,
             or by the courts  of  a  Member  State  to  which  a  decision
             refusing such an application is referred reaches such  a  high
             level that substantial grounds are shown for believing that  a
             civilian, returned to the relevant country or, as the case may
             be, to the relevant region, would, solely on  account  of  his
             presence on the territory of that country or  region,  face  a
             real risk of being subject to that threat."

    [32] In Diakite, the Court, having provided a  definition  of  internal
         armed conflict at [28],  reaffirmed  in  [30]  its  view  that  for
         civilians as such to qualify for  protection  under  Article  15(c)
         they would need to demonstrate that indiscriminate violence was  at
         a high level:


         (30) Furthermore, it should be borne in mind that the existence  of
             an internal  armed  conflict  can  be  a  cause  for  granting
             subsidiary protection  only  where  confrontations  between  a
             State's armed forces and one or more armed groups  or  between
             two or more  armed  groups  are  exceptionally  considered  to
             create a serious and individual threat to the life  or  person
             of an applicant for subsidiary protection for the purposes  of
             Article 15(c) of  Directive  2004/83  because  the  degree  of
             indiscriminate    violence    which    characterises     those
             confrontations reaches such  a  high  level  that  substantial
             grounds are shown for believing that a civilian,  if  returned
             to the relevant country  or,  as  the  case  may  be,  to  the
             relevant region, would - solely on account of his presence  in
             the territory of that country or region - face a real risk  of
             being subject to that threat (see, to that  effect,  Elgafaji,
             paragraph 43)."

         At [31] the Court reaffirmed the view it expressed in  Elgafaji  at
         [39] that Article 15(c) also contains (what  UNHCR  has  termed)  a
         "sliding scale" such that "the more the applicant is able  to  show
         that he is specifically affected by reason of factors particular to
         his personal circumstances, the lower the level  of  indiscriminate
         violence  required  for  him  to   be   eligible   for   subsidiary
         protection."  The Court thereby recognised that a person may  still
         be accorded protection even when the general level of  violence  is
         not very high if they are able to  show  that  there  are  specific
         reasons, over and  above  them  being  mere  civilians,  for  being
         affected by the indiscriminate violence.  In this way  the  Article
         15(c) inquiry is two-pronged: (a) it  asks  whether  the  level  of
         violence is so high that there is a general risk to all  civilians;
         (b) it asks that even if there is not such a general risk, there is
         a specific risk based on the "sliding-scale" notion.

    [33] In the United Kingdom, the principal decision of the higher courts
         dealing with Article 15(c) remains QD (Iraq) v Secretary  of  State
         for the Home Department [2011] 1 WLR 689. QD helpfully explains and
         indicates how Elgafaji should be applied. In addition we  have  the
         guidance set out in HM and others (Article  15(c)  Iraq  CG  [2012]
         UKUT 409 (IAC). At [42]-[45] of HM (Iraq) the Tribunal stated that:


         (42) We  recognise  that  the  threat  to  life  or  person  of  an
             individual need not come directly  from  armed  conflict.   It
             will suffice that the result of such conflict is  a  breakdown
             of law  and  order  which  has  the  effect  of  creating  the
             necessary risk.  It is obvious that the risk is most likely to
             result from indiscriminate bombings or shootings.   These  can
             properly be regarded as  indiscriminate  in  the  sense  that,
             albeit  they  may  have  specific  or  general  targets,  they
             inevitably expose the ordinary civilian who happens to  be  at
             the scene to what has been described in argument as collateral
             damage.  By specific  targets,  we  refer  to  individuals  or
             gatherings of individuals such as army or police officers. The
             means adopted may be bombs, which can  affect  others  besides
             the  target,  or  shootings,  which  produce  a   lesser   but
             nonetheless  real  risk  of  collateral  damage.   By  general
             targets we  refer  to  more  indiscriminate  attacks  on,  for
             example, Sunnis or Shi'as or vice  versa.   Such  attacks  can
             involve explosions of bombs in crowded places such as  markets
             or where religious processions or gatherings are taking place.


         (43)  The  CJEU  requires  us  to  decide  whether  the  degree  of
             indiscriminate  violence  characterising  the  armed  conflict
             taking place  reaches  such  a  high  level  as  to  show  the
             existence for an ordinary civilian of a real risk  of  serious
             harm in the country or in a particular region.  When we  refer
             below to the "Article 15(c) threshold", this is what  we  have
             in mind. Thus it is necessary to assess whether the  level  of
             violence is such as to meet the test. (...)


         (44) In HM1 at  [73]  the  Tribunal  decided  that  an  attempt  to
             distinguish between a real risk  of  targeted  and  incidental
             killing of civilians during armed conflict was not  a  helpful
             exercise.  We agree, but in assessing whether the risk reaches
             the level required by the CJEU, focus on  the  evidence  about
             the numbers of civilians killed or  wounded  is  obviously  of
             prime importance. Thus we have been told that each  death  can
             be multiplied up to seven times when considering  injuries  to
             bystanders.  This is  somewhat  speculative  and  it  must  be
             obvious that the risk  of  what  has  been  called  collateral
             damage will differ depending on the nature of the killing.   A
             bomb is likely to cause far greater "collateral  damage"  than
             an assassination by shooting.  But the incidence  and  numbers
             of death are a helpful starting point.


         (45) The harm in question must be serious enough to  merit  medical
             treatment.  It is not limited to physical harm and can include
             serious mental  harm  such  as,  for  example,  post-traumatic
             stress disorder.  We repeat and adopt what the  Tribunal  said
             in HM1 at [80]:


             In our  judgment  the  nexus  between  the  generalised  armed
             conflict and the indiscriminate violence posing a real risk to
             life or person is met  when  the  intensity  of  the  conflict
             involves means of combat (whether permissible under  the  laws
             of war or not) that seriously endanger non-combatants as  well
             as result in such a general breakdown of law and order  as  to
             permit anarchy and criminality occasioning  the  serious  harm
             referred to in the Directive.  Such violence is indiscriminate
             in effect even if not  necessarily  in  aim.   As  the  French
             Conseil d'Etat observed in Baskarathas, it  is  not  necessary
             for the threat to life or person to derive  from  protagonists
             in the armed conflict in question: it can simply be a  product
             of the breakdown of law and order."


207. These principles were cited at [36]-[42] of the  respondent's  skeleton
    argument and were expressly agreed by Mr Knafler.  The parties  agreed,
    therefore, that we are bound to adopt what  has  become  known  as  the
    "inclusive approach" to the assessment required by Article  15(c).   In
    HM2, the Tribunal said this about the inclusive approach:


         [114] One aspect of the inclusive approach is an appreciation  that
         there are threats to the physical safety and integrity of civilians
         beyond those measured in the civilian casualty rates.   As  put  by
         Michael Knights of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy in
         a report of 16 February, 2012 entitled "A Violent New Year in Iraq,
         The National Interest (cited at  n.  217  of  the  May  2012  UNHCR
         Guidelines), "[m]ass casualty attacks tell only part of  the  story
         of violence in Iraq, and mortality statistics overlook the targeted
         nature of violence in today's Iraq,  where  a  high  proportion  of
         victims are local progovernment community leaders.  For  every  one
         person of this kind who is killed, an exponential number of  others
         are intimidated into passive support for insurgent groups".  Whilst
         our principal focus when examining levels of violence  is  physical
         harm causing death or injury, it is important  that  we  also  take
         account  of  indirect  forms   of   violence   such   as   threats,
         intimidation, blackmail, seizure of property, raids  on  homes  and
         businesses,  use  of  checkpoints  to  push  out  other   factions,
         kidnapping and extortion. To adopt  Mr  Fordham's  metaphor,  these
         factors mean that most Iraqis (outside the KRG) l continue to "live
         under the shadow of violence".

ii) Departure from Extant Country Guidance
208. A further point arises due to the existence of extant country  guidance
    (particularly AA (Iraq)) which is favourable  to  the  appellants.   At
    [33]-[38] of the skeleton argument which was signed by all three junior
    counsel and Mr Cole, reliance was placed on the range of authorities in
    which the Upper Tribunal and the Court of Appeal  have  considered  the
    circumstances in which it is permissible to depart from extant  country
    guidance.  Similar but rather more concise submissions were made in the
    first and second appellant's closing written submissions, at [11]-[13].




209. The correct approach was considered in EM (Zimbabwe) CG [2011] UKUT  98
    (IAC) and comprehensively reviewed in light of subsequent authority  in
    MST (Eritrea)  CG  [2016]  UKUT  443  (IAC),  at  [148]-[154].   In  EM
    (Zimbabwe), Blake J recalled the terms of Practice Direction 12 of  the
    Practice Directions (Immigration and Asylum Chambers of the FtT and the
    Upper Tribunal) of February 2010 and held materially as follows:

    [71]     The proposition that a country guidance  case  should  provide
         the "starting point" for a subsequent  case  that  relates  to  the
         country guidance issue is inherent in the Practice  Direction  (and
         its AIT predecessor).  Whether the subsequent case  is  being  "set
         down to review existing country guidance" or  not,  the  effect  of
         Practice Direction  12  and  section  107(3)  of  the  Nationality,
         Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 is to require the existing  country
         guidance  case  to  be  authoritative,  to  the  extent  that   the
         requirements in Practice Direction 12.2(a) and (b) are met. This is
         fully in accord with what the House of Lords (per Lord Brown)  held
         in R (Hoxha) v Special Adjudicator [2005] UKHL 19. If the  existing
         country guidance is such as to favour appellants (to a  greater  or
         lesser extent), it will in practice be for the respondent to adduce
         before a subsequent Tribunal "sufficient material to satisfy  them"
         that the position has changed" (Paragraph 66).


    [72]     We do not find that the Upper Tribunal's conclusion in  RS  at
         paragraph 199 is of assistance to our task  in  the  present  case.
         There the Upper Tribunal was expressing a view about the  need  for
         cogent evidence to depart from an extant country guidance case in a
         case that was not itself intended to be a country guidance case  on
         the issue before us. The present cases have  long  been  designated
         country guidance on the issue of a change  in  circumstances  since
         RN, and we are re-examining all material data to  inform  ourselves
         what the present evidential position is.   We  recognise  that  the
         country guidance system has limitations if extant decisions  become
         out of date and not based  on  relevant  assessments  as  close  as
         reasonably practicable to the date of the decision. The solution is
         two fold.  First,  in  individual  appeals  where  there  is  fresh
         material not available at the time  of  the  country  guidance  the
         Immigration Judge will be  entitled  to  depart  from  the  country
         guidance in the particular case on the basis that the guidance  was
         either not directed to  the  particular  issue  in  the  subsequent
         appeals, or the factual assessment in the guidance case has now  to
         be updated in the  light  of  relevant  cogent  fresh  information.
         Second, it is for the Tribunal to identify appeals as suitable  for
         fresh country guidance where a fundamental review of  all  relevant
         material should be undertaken to  see  whether  the  situation  has
         changed.  The observations in TK were directed to the first  class,
         rather than setting a test for departure from country  guidance  in
         all circumstances. We nevertheless recognise that where a  previous
         assessment has resulted  in  the  conclusion  that  the  population
         generally or certain sections of it may be at risk, any  assessment
         that  the  material  circumstances  have  changed  would  need   to
         demonstrate that such changes are well established evidentially and
         durable. That is the test that we will apply in  our  consideration
         of the material but not as a preliminary reason to  decide  whether
         we should revisit RN at all.

210. At [118] of CM (Zimbabwe) CG [2013] UKUT 59 (IAC), Blake J returned  to
    the subject and held that what he had said in EM (Zimbabwe) was not  to
    be interpreted as imposing some sort of legal gloss on PD12  so  as  to
    place greater restrictions on a Tribunal making  a  later  CG  decision
    than would be placed on a judge of the FtT hearing a subsequent appeal.
     He had not intended to set a test to be satisfied before  an  existing
    CG decision  could  be  varied  but  merely  to  describe  a  means  of
    approaching and evaluating the nature of the changes in  the  evidence.
    He continued:


         Where a regime has engaged in persecutory conduct of  a  particular
         type even for a limited period, the judge undertaking a  subsequent
         analysis will need to  be  satisfied  that  the  cessation  of  the
         conduct was durable before concluding that either Country  Guidance
         should not be  followed  or  (if  engaged  in  a  Country  Guidance
         exercise) that the Guidance itself needed to be amended.  There  is
         no rule of law here but simply an application of the  precautionary
         principle relating to the assessment of  reasonable  likelihood  of
         harm, where the previous assessment of risk was itself based on  an
         unusually virulent and widespread outburst of persecutory  activity
         dating from June 2008, the nature and duration of which  needed  to
         be assessed with care.

211. At [48] of the respondent's skeleton, it was  suggested  that  we  were
    concerned, in summary, to assess: (i)  whether  material  circumstances
    have changed; and  (ii)  whether  such  changes  are  well  established
    evidentially and durable.  Mr  Knafler  expressly  accepted  that  this
    summary of our task was accurate. Having considered MST  (Eritrea),  we
    agree.  As the Upper Tribunal stated at [154]  of  that  decision,  the
    correct approach is now well established.

iii) The Assessment of Future Risk
212. One final point emerges from EM (Zimbabwe),  and  is  considered  under
    the  sub-heading  'The  Legal  Assessment  of  Future  Risk'   in   the
    respondent's closing written submissions.  The same sub-heading appears
    above [247]-[265] of the Upper Tribunal's decision in that case.  In EM
    (Zimbabwe), it was submitted on behalf of the appellant that  elections
    in Zimbabwe usually brought increased political violence and that  this
    future risk should be considered, in addition to the  position  at  the
    date of hearing.  In these appeals, it is submitted by  the  appellants
    that the situation in Iraq, and in the contested areas  in  particular,
    is likely to change in the future with a  consequent  increase  in  the
    risk to the appellants.  It was agreed on all sides before us that  the
    law was correctly stated in EM (Zimbabwe), and  in  this  paragraph  in
    particular:

    [258]    In  the  present  appeals,  both  sides  agreed  that,  in  Mr
         Henderson's words, there needed to be a "single holistic assessment
         of whether there is a real risk of serious harm  in  the  event  of
         return as opposed to a mere possibility" of serious  harm,  in  the
         event of return.  As we have already said,  and  as  the  case  law
         plainly  reveals,  this   inevitably   involves   an   element   of
         prognostication on the  part  of  the  Tribunal.   In  her  closing
         submissions, Ms Grey acknowledged that the judgment in Saadi, which
         spoke of examining "the foreseeable  consequences  of  sending  the
         applicant to the receiving country," necessitated an examination of
         the risk of change to an existing situation.  That  was  what  SIAC
         had done in DD.  According to Ms Grey, it is not suggested  by  the
         respondent that there is any  "bright-line"  test  to  be  adopted,
         based upon some temporal rules; rather the Tribunal  looks  to  see
         what are the foreseeable consequences of return.  As  the  date  at
         which events/risks might  transpire  or  materialise  becomes  more
         remote, so their prospects become more  uncertain;  and  the  "real
         risk" test becomes progressively more difficult to satisfy.

iv) Article 3 ECHR / Article 15(b) QD
213.  Only  two  authorities  were  cited  to  us  in  connection  with  the
    evaluation of whether the conditions experienced by an individual in  a
    particular territory might, without more, be a breach of Article 3 ECHR
    (and Article 15(b)).  The cases cited (by the respondent) were Saadi  v
    Italy (2009) 49 EHRR 30 and DD v SSHD [2008] EWCA Civ 289.  Neither  is
    of any real assistance beyond stating the well-established standard  of
    proof in an Article 3 ECHR case, however, since neither case  concerned
    an individual who contended that his mere presence in the territory  of
    return would breach that  article.   In  both  cases,  it  was  instead
    contended that the individual in question would be  intentionally  ill-
    treated upon return.

214. The correct approach in cases such as the present has  been  considered
    by the ECtHR and the domestic courts on a number of occasions, however.
     The review conducted by Laws LJ in GS (India) & Ors  [2015]  EWCA  Civ
    40; [2015] 1 WLR 3312 considered the state of the ECtHR authorities  as
    they stood at the end of 2014, albeit in the context of what  has  come
    to be known as a 'health case'.  At [57], Laws LJ noted that there  was
    a 'fork in the road' between the approach in N v United Kingdom on  the
    one hand and MSS v Belgium on the other.  He considered it difficult to
    discern  any  governing  principle  which  provided  a  rationale   for
    departure from the approach in N v UK but  he  noted  that  there  were
    certain strands of reasoning in the cases which assisted.

215. The Court of Appeal returned to Laws LJ's fork in the road  in  SSHD  v
    Said [2016] EWCA Civ 442; [2016]  Imm  AR  1084,  which  concerned  the
    deportation of a Somali national whose appeal had been allowed  in  the
    Upper Tribunal on the basis that the conditions to which  he  would  be
    exposed on return to Somali  would  be  contrary  to  Article  3  ECHR.
    Burnett LJ (as he then was) reviewed the Article 3  ECHR  jurisprudence
    at some length from [12]-[18].  His conclusion in the latter  paragraph
    (with which Sharp and Christopher Clarke LJJ agreed) was as follows:

         These cases demonstrate that to succeed  in  resisting  removal  on
         article 3 grounds on the basis of suggested poverty or  deprivation
         on return which are not the responsibility of the receiving country
         or others in the sense described in para 282 of  Sufi  and  Elmi  ,
         whether or not the  feared  deprivation  is  contributed  to  by  a
         medical condition, the  person  liable  to  deportation  must  show
         circumstances which bring him within the approach of the Strasbourg
         Court in the D and N cases. [emphasis supplied]

216. At [19], Burnett LJ explained why Said's particular circumstances  were
    not such as could preclude his removal to Somalia on Article 3 grounds.
     He then clarified the proper approach to the country guidance  in  MOJ
    (Somalia).  Said was cited in MA (Somalia) [2018] EWCA Civ 994;  [2019]
    1 WLR 241, in which Arden LJ (as she then was) stated:

         [63] The analysis in Said, by which this Court is  bound,  is  that
         there is no violation of Article 3 by reason only of a person being
         returned to a country which for economic reasons cannot provide him
         with basic living standards. Mr Sills however  contends  that  that
         situation is brought about by conflict, which is recognised by  the
         European Court of Human Rights as an exception to this analysis. It
         is true  that  there  has  historically  been  severe  conflict  in
         Somalia, but, on the basis of MOJ, that would  not  necessarily  be
         the cause of deprivation if the respondent were returned to Somalia
         now. The evidence is that there is no present reason why a  person,
         with support from his family and/or prospects of employment, should
         face unacceptable living standards.

217. Further guidance on the caveat at [282] of Sufi & Elmi was provided  in
    MI (Palestine) [2018] EWCA Civ 1782; [2019] Imm AR 75.   The  appellant
    and his wife were to be returned to Gaza, and it was submitted  to  the
    Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge that the risks to her health, combined with
    the harsh conditions in the place of return, would amount to  a  breach
    of Article 3 ECHR.  The DUTJ applied the test in N v UK and  held  that
    the high threshold in that decision was not reached.   Flaux  LJ,  with
    whom King LJ agreed, concluded that the DUTJ had erred in adopting that
    approach.


218. Flaux LJ reviewed the European  and  domestic  authorities  again.   He
    noted that the paradigm Article 3 ECHR case was one in which there  was
    an intentional act which constituted torture or  inhuman  or  degrading
    treatment or punishment and that the case of someone whose  life  would
    be shortened by the progress of a natural disease did not  fall  within
    that paradigm.  In the latter category of case, Strasbourg  had  set  a
    very high threshold.  He noted, as had Laws LJ in GS  &  EO,  that  the
    Strasbourg court had rejected the application of the N v  UK  threshold
    in  Sufi  &  Elmi  because  the  humanitarian  crisis  in  Somalia  was
    predominantly due to the direct and indirect actions of the parties  to
    the conflict there: [19]. He cited what Laws LJ had observed about  the
    rationale of the decision in MSS, in which Greece had been impugned for
    breach of Article 3 because of the applicant's plight in Greece itself,
    rather than in a third country: [20]. Having considered Said  in  light
    of the earlier authorities, Flaux LJ stated that the  Court  of  Appeal
    had "evidently considered that the Country Guidance  case  showed  that
    the  conditions  in  Somalia,  although  harsh,  could  no  longer   be
    attributed to the direct and indirect actions of  the  parties  to  the
    former conflict so that the N test applied to the applicant's case  and
    he could not satisfy that test".


219. At [30]-[34], Flaux LJ held that the Deputy Judge had erred in  law  in
    failing to consider whether the approach in MSS v Belgium  should  have
    been applied to the country conditions in Palestine.  He considered  it
    sufficiently arguable, having had regard to  the  country  information,
    that the conditions  in  Gaza  were  attributable  to  the  direct  and
    indirect actions of the parties to the conflict within the  meaning  of
    [282] of Sufi & Elmi and that there was an "element of intentionality":
    [32].  The appeal was remitted to the Upper Tribunal to decide  whether
    to apply the approach in N v UK or MSS v Belgium.  In a  case  such  as
    the present, in which it is submitted that return of an  individual  to
    Iraq would breach Article 3 ECHR as a result of the country  conditions
    themselves, it is necessary  to  consider  which  of  these  thresholds
    applies.

                            SECTION E - ANALYSIS

Article 15(c)
220. It will be apparent from the submissions recorded above  that  the  law
    and the facts, at least in relation  to  the  background  situation  in
    Iraq, are not  substantially  in  dispute  between  the  parties.   The
    approach we are required to adopt to Article 15(c) of the Qualification
    Directive is settled domestically and in Luxembourg and  is  summarised
    above.

221. We have taken the existing country guidance as our starting point  but,
    as will become apparent, the determination of these  appeals  does  not
    depend upon the same or  similar  evidence  as  was  before  the  Upper
    Tribunal in AA (Iraq), in which it was  found  that  the  situation  in
    certain parts of Iraq reached the Article 15(c) threshold.

222. We were referred to hundreds of pages  of  background  material  during
    the course of the hearing.  Dozens of pages of written submissions were
    made and supplemented by hours of oral submissions.  We do  not  intend
    any criticism of the representatives in making  that  observation.   On
    the contrary, we have been greatly assisted by the  material  presented
    and  by  the  submissions  we  received  about  it.   In  reaching  our
    conclusions, however, it is obviously not feasible to  refer  to  every
    item of background material or to every submission made, since to do so
    would produce a decision of unnecessary length.  We have considered all
    of the submissions made, and all of the background material to which we
    have been referred.  In considering the background situation,  we  note
    the diversity of the sources to which we were referred, which  included
    EU and state-funded bodies such as EASO  and  Landinfo  (the  Norwegian
    Country  of  Origin  Information   Service),   other   non-governmental
    organisations such as Amnesty International, and statistical  data  and
    opinion from individual commentators such as the author of the  Musings
    on Iraq blog, Joel Wing.  As noted above, we were particularly assisted
    by Dr Fatah's evidence and by the March 2019 reports from the  European
    Asylum Support Office due to the care taken by  both  to  identify  the
    sources of their evidence and opinions.


223. Although we refer extensively to those reports, we have considered  the
    other material carefully,  and  have  paid  particular  regard  to  the
    UNHCR's May 2019 International Protection Considerations with Regard to
    People Fleeing the Republic of Iraq, as a result of what  was  said  at
    [155]-[158] of MST (Eritrea) CG [2016] UKUT 443  (IAC).   We  note  two
    points in connection  with  that  guidance  at  this  stage.   Firstly,
    because the guidance is not primarily focussed upon  Article  15(c)  of
    the  Qualification  Directive,  it  does  not  contain   an   extensive
    examination of the  situation  in  the  Formerly  Contested  Areas  and
    Baghdad.  For that reason, we have derived more assistance from reports
    such as those prepared by Dr Fatah, EASO and  Joel  Wing,  which  focus
    individual scrutiny on the areas under consideration in these  appeals.



224. Secondly, it is not correct to assert, as Mr Knafler  and  his  juniors
    do at [50] of their closing submissions, that 'the view of UNHCR and Dr
    Fatah is that A15(c) does apply right now in  the  [contested  areas]'.
    As an  experienced  expert,  Dr  Fatah  is  well  aware  that  such  an
    assessment is for the Tribunal, not for him.  And the UNHCR simply does
    not state in its May 2019 report that Article 15(c) applies  throughout
    the formerly contested areas.  UNHCR certainly advises against  returns
    to those areas but its stance on Eligibility for Subsidiary  Protection
    under the EU Qualification Directive is to suggest a close analysis  of
    the situation in the home territory and consideration  of  the  precise
    circumstances of the individual:


         Iraqis and former habitual residents of Iraq who seek international
         protection in Member States of the European Union and who are found
         not to be refugees  under  the  1951  Convention  may  qualify  for
         subsidiary protection under Article 15 of  the  2011  Qualification
         Directive, if there are substantial grounds for believing that they
         would face a real risk of serious harm in Iraq.  In  light  of  the
         information  presented  in  Section  II.C  of   these   Guidelines,
         applicants may, depending on the individual  circumstances  of  the
         case, be in need of subsidiary protection under  Article  15(a)  or
         Article 15(b) on the grounds of a real risk of the  relevant  forms
         of serious harm (death penalty or execution; or torture or  inhuman
         or degrading treatment or punishment), either at the hands  of  the
         State or its agents, or at the hands of non-state agents.


         Equally, in light of the fact that Iraq continues to be affected by
         a non-international armed conflict and in light of the  information
         presented  in  Sections  II.B,  II.C,  II.D  and  II.E   of   these
         Considerations, applicants originating from or previously  residing
         in  conflict-affected  areas  may,  depending  on  the   individual
         circumstances of the case, be  in  need  of  subsidiary  protection
         under Article 15(c) on the grounds  of  a  serious  and  individual
         threat  to  their  life  or  person  by  reason  of  indiscriminate
         violence. [emphasis supplied]


         In the context of the armed conflict in Iraq, factors to  be  taken
         into account to assess the threat to  the  life  or  person  of  an
         applicant by reason of indiscriminate violence in a particular part
         of the country include  the  number  of  civilian  casualties,  the
         number of security incidents, as well as the existence  of  serious
         violations  of  international  humanitarian  law  which  constitute
         threats to life or physical integrity. Such considerations are not,
         however, limited to the direct impact of  the  violence,  but  also
         encompass the consequences of violence that are more long-term  and
         indirect, including the impact of the conflict on the human  rights
         situation and the extent to which the conflict impedes the  ability
         of the State to  protect  human  rights.  In  the  context  of  the
         conflict in Iraq, relevant factors in  this  respect  are  (i)  the
         continued presence of ISIS in areas outside of urban centres, where
         effective government control has not been established following the
         retaking of these areas from  ISIS  and  the  latter's  ability  to
         threaten,  intimidate,  extort,  kidnap  and  kill  civilians   and
         restrict  their  freedom  of  movement;  (ii)  the  high  level  of
         fragmentation of security actors, the prevalence of corruption  and
         the ability of security actors to commit  human  rights  violations
         with impunity; (iii) the impact of violence and insecurity  on  the
         humanitarian situation as manifested by food  insecurity,  poverty,
         the destruction of homes, livelihoods and the loss of  assets;  and
         (iv) constraints on women's participation in public life.


         These factors, either alone or cumulatively, may be found  to  give
         rise  to  a  situation  in  a  particular  part  of  Iraq  that  is
         sufficiently serious to engage Article 15(c) without the  need  for
         the applicant to demonstrate individual  factors  or  circumstances
         increasing the risk of harm. Where, after all relevant evidence has
         been considered, this is found not to be the case in  the  part  of
         Iraq from which the applicant originates, it falls to be considered
         whether the applicant's individual characteristics are such  as  to
         reveal specific vulnerabilities which, combined with the nature and
         the extent of the violence, give rise to a serious  and  individual
         threat to the applicant's life or person.

225. That is precisely the approach we intend to  adopt,  since  it  accords
    with the approach required by the jurisprudence of  the  CJEU  and  our
    domestic courts.

226. In considering Article 15(c), the first but by no means the only  issue
    we are required to consider is the presence  of  ISIL  and  the  threat
    posed by that group to the population of Iraq, and  to  the  population
    the formerly contested areas in particular.  Before we turn  to  ISIL's
    current presence and activity in the country, we refer briefly  to  the
    situation in 2015, which led the respondent to  concede  in  AA  (Iraq)
    that the level of risk to a civilian solely on account of his  presence
    in the then contested areas was such as  to  cross  the  Article  15(c)
    threshold in the generality of cases.   At  that  stage,  ISIL  was  in
    control of approximately a third of Iraq, including Mosul  (its  second
    city) and Amnesty International recorded that the group had carried out
    'ethnic cleansing on a historic scale in Iraq': AA (Iraq) at  [32]  and
    [103].  In the same paragraph, the United  Nations  Assistance  Mission
    was recorded as having found numerous examples of  targeted  executions
    and the use of mass graves in the country.  In its March  2019  report,
    EASO referred to ISIL having 'a  sustained  and  deliberate  policy  of
    executing civilians as a means of exerting control and instilling fear'
    in the areas it controlled between June 2014 and December 2017.

227. It is accepted on all sides that ISIL is  still  present  in  Iraq  and
    that it is still active.  It is accepted  that  there  is  a  state  of
    internal armed conflict in the country and that there is some  risk  to
    civilians as a result of  that  conflict.   The  material  question  is
    whether the violence in the areas  under  consideration  remains  at  a
    scale and intensity whereby the  Appellants,  or  any  other  returning
    civilian, would by his presence alone face  a  serious  and  individual
    threat to his life or person.  We  will  consider  ISIL's  activity  in
    specific areas below but we note at the outset two figures provided  by
    Dr Fatah, both of which were said by him to be estimates.  We  received
    a great deal of evidence about ISIL 'sleeper' or 'attack' cells,  which
    carry  out  a  range  of  insurgent  activities,   including   targeted
    assassinations, the creation of fake  checkpoints  and,  latterly,  the
    burning of crops and agricultural infrastructure.  We  asked  Dr  Fatah
    about the size of these cells and he estimated that they would probably
    contain in the region of three to five individuals.   Asked  about  the
    number of ISIL  fighters  remaining  in  Iraq  as  a  whole,  Dr  Fatah
    estimated that their numbers had been reduced to somewhere between  ten
    and twenty five per cent of their full strength of 8000  fighters.   On
    that evidence, between 800 and  2000  remain  in  the  whole  of  Iraq,
    therefore.  There is a range of opinion about  the  numbers  remaining.
    At 1.3.2 of its March 2019 report, EASO noted that the US Department of
    State had estimated in August 2018 that there were between  15,500  and
    17,100 ISIL fighters remaining in the country.  It  then  recorded  the
    view of Hisham al-Hashimi in July 2018,  which  was  that  around  1000
    remain.  Given the range of sources consulted by Dr Fatah and the  fact
    that his evidence was given considerably more recently, we consider his
    estimate to be the most reliable before us.

228. ISIL was militarily defeated at the end of 2017 and all  sources  agree
    that its tactics have changed significantly since then.  It  no  longer
    holds swathes of territory and it is  simply  not  able  to  carry  out
    ethnic cleansing and genocide, whether on a historic scale or  at  all.
    There  are  now  concentrations  of  ISIL  fighters   in   27   places,
    particularly but not exclusively in remote desert areas and  along  the
    Hamrin Mountain Ridge.  Their primary activity, as Dr  Fatah  described
    throughout his evidence, is on  what  he  described  as  'hit  and  go'
    attacks on identified targets.  These asymmetric attacks are most often
    directed at figures of authority or those associated with the  security
    forces.  As Dr Fatah put it in his oral evidence, they are  'selective'
    in their targets.  All sources agree that the focus of  the  insurgency
    is now on destabilising the security situation in those areas in  which
    it retains a presence, exploiting Sunni grievances  and  attempting  to
    rebuild.

229. The military defeat of ISIL and the changed focus of  their  operations
    has brought with it what the respondent describes as a 'seismic change'
    in the security situation in Iraq.  Michael Knights states that ISIL is
    now at its 'lowest operational tempo'.  Joel Wing  stated  in  his  1-7
    April blog that the violence in Iraq is at its lowest level since 2003.
     In considering the extent of that change on a national  level,  it  is
    instructive to consider some statistical data concerning the  situation
    in Iraq as a whole.  We take this information  from  section  9  of  Dr
    Fatah's report, which  relies  upon  data  from  the  Iraq  Body  Count
    website, which was noted at [110] of HM (Iraq) CG [2012] UKUT 409 to be
    more reliable than  other  datasets,  due  to  their  use  of  multiple
    sources.  (We note that the UNHCR's May 2019 report cites figures  from
    IBC, as well as UNAMI).

230. Saddam Hussein was removed from power in  2003,  in  which  year  there
    were  12,133  civilians  killed.   The  number  fell  slightly  in  the
    following year, to 11,736.  The number then rose to the  first  of  two
    peaks in 2007, in which year there were 29,451 civilians  killed.   The
    number then fell, year on year, to 4,153 in  2011.   As  ISIL  rose  in
    prominence in the region,  the  number  then  climbed  again  until  it
    reached 20,218 in 2014.  The numbers declined in  2015  (17,578),  2016
    (16,360) and 2017 (13,187)  before  falling  dramatically  in  2018  to
    3,319.  It is to be recalled, when considering those figures, that  HM2
    was decided in November 2012; AA (Iraq) was decided in  on  30  October
    2015; and ISIL was defeated militarily at the end of 2017.  This  graph
    from Iraq Body Count for the period 2012 to 2018, which is  from  1.5.1
    of the EASO report on the general  security  situation[6],  provides  a
    graphical representation of the trends over the last six years.



                                    [pic]

231. The statistics compiled by the various organisations  and  commentators
    do not tally precisely, as was recognised on all sides.   As  Dr  Fatah
    explained, however, the trends reflected in the statistics  remain  the
    same, even if the numbers vary from source to source.  His  opinion  in
    that respect mirrors EASO's comment immediately below the graph we have
    reproduced.  The trend shown in the graph is reflected in  all  of  the
    sources, as it was in Dr  Fatah's  oral  evidence.   It  is  abundantly
    clear, considering the situation in Iraq as a whole that the numbers of
    security incidents and civilian casualties and civilian casualties have
    decreased significantly since 2014.

232. There will be further reference to statistics in the later sections  of
    this decision.  We consider them as part of an inclusive  approach  and
    with some caution as a result of the under-reporting to which Dr  Fatah
    referred in his evidence  (as  partly  attributable  to  the  need  for
    Islamic burials to  take  place  shortly  after  death).   It  is  also
    appropriate to record two other observations about such statistics.

233. Many of the data sources to which we were referred  record  numbers  of
    'security incidents' in parts of Iraq.  Dr  Fatah's  reports  helpfully
    include not only the numbers of such security incidents  in  each  area
    but also a short description of the incident  in  question.   We  noted
    that a number of the security incidents he described were not incidents
    which might be said to bear on the assessment  of  risk  under  Article
    15(c).  At [405]-[442] of his first report, for example,  he  describes
    the security incidents in Salah al Din Governorate between 31  December
    2017 and 3 February 2019.  Of  the  37  incidents  recorded  over  that
    period, 10 related to the  discovery  of  'hotbeds'  of  ISIL  and  the
    clearance of ISIL caches of weapons and explosives.  We asked Dr  Fatah
    whether it was standard for commentators to record  incidents  of  this
    nature as security incidents.  He  confirmed  that  this  was  standard
    practice.   Whilst  we  understand  the  reason  why  such  events  are
    recorded, we consider there to be a danger in relating  the  number  of
    security incidents with  the  risk  of  indiscriminate  violence  under
    Article 15(c) because incidents of this nature reflect the reduction in
    ISIL's capability rather than the proliferation of its operations.


234. Secondly, we noted that Dr Fatah's reports included  bodies  discovered
    in mass graves in the  regional  casualty  figures  for  the  month  in
    question.  That appeared to follow the approach of other  commentators,
    including Joel Wing who writes the  Musings  on  Iraq  blog  which  was
    placed before us by the respondent.  In answer  to  our  questions,  Dr
    Fatah confirmed that it was usual for commentators on  Iraq  to  record
    bodies discovered in mass graves as casualties which  occurred  in  the
    month of their discovery.  It is sadly a commonplace of life  in  post-
    ISIL Iraq that such mass graves are regularly discovered.   The  impact
    of such discoveries on the statistics is apparent from a number of  the
    sources before us.  At 1.2.5 of  the  respondent's  "Situation  on  the
    Ground" report from March 2019, for example,  Joel  Wing's  Musings  on
    Iraq blog was quoted as saying that there were  112  casualties  during
    the week  8-14  March  2019  "because  of  a  mass  grave".   The  blog
    continued, stating that the bodies of 65 people, believed to be members
    of the Iraqi Election Commission, had been discovered in a  mass  grave
    in the Baaj District in Western Ninewa.  As a result of that discovery,
    the blog reported that there were 67 casualties in Ninewa  during  that
    week.  At first blush, such a statistic  would  appear  to  indicate  a
    fairly significant risk to the population of Ninewa.  When it is  borne
    in mind that the statistic takes into  account  the  deaths  of  people
    which occurred during ISIL's control of the area,  however,  it  is  of
    marginal relevance to  the  present  risk  of  indiscriminate  violence
    contrary to Article 15(c).


235.  The  impact  of  the  discoveries  of  mass  graves  on  the  casualty
    statistics is potentially significant, and  particularly  so  when  the
    number of such  graves  in  areas  previously  controlled  by  ISIL  is
    understood.  The second of the EASO reports from March  2019,  entitled
    Iraq: Targeting of Individuals, records that UNAMI released a report in
    November 2018 in which it documented the discovery of 202  mass  graves
    since June 2014, the overwhelming majority  of  which  contain  victims
    killed by ISIL.  Estimates provided to UNAMI range from 6000 to  12,000
    buried in these sites, with the largest number  being  located  in  the
    governorates of Ninewa (95), Kirkuk (37), Salah al-Din (36)  and  Anbar
    (24).

236. Whether or not allowance  is  made  for  the  observations  immediately
    above, the national trend is clearly of a  greatly  reduced  number  of
    security incidents and civilian casualties.  The  latest  figures  from
    Musings on Iraq show some spikes in  security  incidents  and  civilian
    casualties but the overall picture remains one of  improvement.   There
    is reference in the Musings blog to ISIL mounting a  new  spring/summer
    offensive called The Return of the Levant but Dr Fatah stated that this
    was 'na�ve' and it is clear that it has made no significant  impact  on
    the general trends shown by the graph above.

237. UNAMI has published numbers of casualties from the six  worst  affected
    governorates in Iraq on a monthly basis  since  November  2012.   On  3
    January 2019, however, it issued a statement which is quoted  at  3.2.2
    of the Home Office report entitled Iraq: Situation on the ground  dated
    May 2019:

         UNAMI used to publish these casualty figures on a monthly basis  as
         part of its broader efforts to highlight civilian protection needs,
         reduce civilian harm, and to encourage all parties to the  conflict
         to abide by their obligations under international human rights  and
         humanitarian law. However, UNAMI's monitoring in recent months  has
         shown  a  steady  reduction  in  civilian  casualties.  UNAMI   has
         therefore decided that it will no  longer  publish  these  civilian
         casualty updates on a  monthly  basis  but  only  if  circumstances
         dictate.  Whilst  this  decision  is  made  in  the  context  of  a
         stabilizing security  situation,  and  a  consequent  reduction  in
         conflict-related harm to civilians, the conditions necessary for  a
         sustained reduction in violence remain very  fragile.  UNAMI  will,
         therefore, continue to monitor the situation.

238. Alongside that statement, UNAMI issued its final statistics,  which  it
    regarded as the 'absolute minimum'.  It stated that a total of 32 Iraqi
    civilians were killed in December 2018 and another 32 were  injured  in
    acts of terrorism.  For comparison, the worst month recorded  by  UNAMI
    was June 2014, in which  1775  civilians  were  killed  and  2351  were
    injured.  (In answer to the respondent's written question 28, Dr  Fatah
    confirmed that the trends revealed by these figures had continued  into
    the first three months of 2019).   It  is  obviously  significant  that
    UNAMI decided in January 2019 that it would no longer  release  monthly
    casualty figures.

239. We cite these figures simply in order to provide  an  overview  of  the
    much-reduced incidence of civilian deaths and casualties in  Iraq.   We
    recognise that there is considerable regional variation in the casualty
    rates and that it is necessary to consider  those  areas  individually.
    We accept the submission made by Mr Bazini that any such figures should
    be treated with some caution due to the under-reporting of  casualties.
    The same submission was accepted at [126]  of  AA  (Iraq).     We  also
    recognise a point made  in  both  HM  (Iraq)  decisions;  although  the
    numbers  of  civilians  killed  or  wounded  is  obviously  of   "prime
    importance" in assessing risk under Article 15(c), it  is  nevertheless
    necessary to  adopt  an  inclusive  approach  to  the  assessment.   In
    undertaking that assessment, we  have  borne  in  mind  the  additional
    guidance provided at [114] of HM2, which we have  set  out  above,  and
    also what was said by the Upper Tribunal at [89] of AA  (Iraq)  and  at
    [163] of AK (Afghanistan) CG [2012]  UKUT  163.   We  will  adopt  that
    approach when considering the situation in  individual  areas  but  the
    national statistics provide an  introduction  to  that  analysis.   The
    statistics led Michael Knights (who continues to  be  a  well-respected
    commentator on Iraq) to state in his 14 December 2018 report that  ISIL
    is currently functioning at  its  'lowest  operational  tempo  (at  the
    national aggregate level) since its nadir in late 2010'.


240. There are other indicators of the security  situation  improving  at  a
    national  level.   Although  extensive  humanitarian  concerns  remain,
    Internally Displaced Persons continue to return to their home areas  at
    a  steadily  increasing  rate.   Whilst  displacement   and   secondary
    displacement continues to occur in  certain  areas,  some  4.1  million
    Iraqis had returned to their areas of origin as of  31  December  2018.
    It is against the backdrop of improving security and increasing returns
    that Dr Fatah reports the current government as stating that its  focus
    is now on  post  conflict  recovery  and  reconstruction.   We  do  not
    consider this to be  mere  rhetoric.   Security  has  been  relaxed  in
    Baghdad, which has seen a reduction in the number  of  checkpoints  and
    the removal of blast protection barriers and the government has  sought
    substantial international funding  to  rebuild  those  parts  of  Iraq,
    including Mosul in particular, which suffered the  most  damage  during
    2014-2017 battle to regain control of the contested areas from ISIL.

241. These national trends were not disputed by the appellants.   Nor  could
    they have been, since they are reflected across the materials  we  were
    asked to consider, including the written and oral evidence of Dr Fatah.
     Building on the evidence of Dr Fatah, however, it was submitted by the
    appellants that Iraq remains  deeply  unsettled  and  that  the  proper
    application of the inclusive approach can only lead to  the  conclusion
    that there has not been a durable change which justifies departure from
    the existing country guidance in  respect  of  the  formerly  contested
    areas  in  particular.   Before  we  consider  the  situation  in   the
    individual governorates, we turn to  the  destabilising  factors  which
    were highlighted by Dr Fatah, since they are  relevant  to  Iraq  as  a
    whole, albeit to varying degrees depending on, for example, the  ethnic
    composition of the area in question.

242. Iraq  remains  characterised  by  deep  ethnic,  tribal  and  political
    divisions  which  are  fuelled  by  the  presence  and   influence   of
    international actors in the country.  As  will  be  apparent  from  our
    summary of Dr Fatah's evidence, a recurring theme was the role  of  the
    PMUs.  As ISIL was on the rise in  Iraq,  a  fatwa  was  pronounced  by
    Ayatollah Sistani, a prominent Shia cleric in  Iran,  asking  Shias  to
    fight against the occupying  insurgency.   Shias  from  Iran  and  Iraq
    responded  in  their  thousands  and  the  PMU  provided   considerable
    assistance to the Iraqi Security Forces ("ISF") in the military  defeat
    of ISIL.  In December 2016, a law was  passed,  incorporating  the  PMU
    into Iraq's armed forces.  They remain a considerable presence in Iraq,
    and  particularly  in  the  parts  of  the  country  which  are   under
    consideration in this decision.  The PMUs receive funding and influence
    from Iran and remain a part of the  security  apparatus  which,  in  Dr
    Fatah's words, keeps a foot on the throat of ISIL.

243. The difficulties with the PMUs were apparent even at the  time  of  the
    decision in AA (Iraq), however, as is  clear  from  [34]-[35]  of  that
    decision.   Whilst  the  presence  of  such  a   sizeable   force   was
    instrumental in the defeat of ISIL, the Tribunal noted in 2015 that the
    was a pattern of Shia militia attacks,  motivated  by  retaliation  for
    ISIL activities but also by sectarian hatred and ordinary  criminality.
    Dr Fatah stated in his  oral  evidence  before  us  that  although  the
    problem of young Sunni men being taken and  killed  from  Shia  militia
    checkpoints had reduced significantly, other problems  associated  with
    the militia remain.  As we will see in respect of the individual  areas
    below, the largely unaccountable PMU contribute to sectarian  divisions
    across Iraq, including by the renaming of Sunni and Kurdish sites  with
    Shia names and by participating in criminality and  extortion.   As  Dr
    Fatah suggested in his oral evidence, it is to be remembered that  Iran
    has a policy of 'exporting revolution' and it seems unlikely, in  light
    of that policy and the clear  role  played  by  the  PMU  in  enforcing
    security in Iraq, that these forces will withdraw  in  the  foreseeable
    future.

244. The  presence  of  the  PMUs  contributes  to  the  feelings  of  Sunni
    resentment which have long existed in Iraq.  Saddam Hussein was a Sunni
    from Tikrit and the Sunnis held the upper hand  in  the  country  until
    2003.  From that point onwards, the Sunnis  became  less  powerful  and
    their resentment simmered in the face of Shia domination,  particularly
    in certain areas.  Dr Fatah explained in his  oral  evidence  how  this
    enabled ISIL to build support in various Sunni tribes, in which it  was
    thought that the 'enemy of my enemy is my friend'.  As  the  resentment
    towards the PMUs continues, concern has been expressed in some quarters
    that this disenchantment will fuel the resurgence of ISIL.

245. After the hearing of these appeals had been concluded,  the  appellants
    sought to file a report which was published by the  Institute  for  the
    Study of War in June 2019, entitled ISIS's Second  Comeback,  Assessing
    the Next ISIS Insurgency.  It is a lengthy  report  but  its  principal
    conclusion may be summarised quite  briefly:  ISIL  will  seek  to  re-
    establish territorial control in Iraq and Syria and it will  be  likely
    to succeed in the event that US forces withdraw (page 8 of  the  report
    refers).  The respondent made brief submissions in writing in  response
    to this report.  Although leave was given to neither party to file such
    post-hearing material, we have nevertheless considered it.  Having done
    so, we attach greater weight to the material filed by the respondent in
    response to the ISW report, for the following reasons.

246. In the respondent's material, Michael Knights  is  recorded  as  saying
    that the popular basis for Sunni insurgency has  'never  been  smaller'
    due to the brutality of ISIL towards its own people  between  2014  and
    2017.  In similar vein, Joel Wing in his 17 July 2019 Musings  on  Iraq
    blog quoted an Italian reporter named Daniele  Raineri  who  said  that
    the 'whole concept of the Islamic State as the right solution  for  the
    grievances of the Sunni people in Iraq and Syria has been proven false'
    and that there was an 'ideological vaccination' against  ISIL.   As  Dr
    Fatah put it during his oral evidence, ISIL 'lost the hearts and minds'
    of the Iraqi people during their brutal  occupation  of  the  contested
    areas.  The ISW report, in contrast, fails to recognise that a  crucial
    and significant inhibitor on the resurgence of ISIL in Iraq is that the
    disaffected Sunnis have recently experienced life under  ISIL  and  are
    likely to prefer life under the PMUs.  That said, we recognise that the
    presence of the largely Shia PMUs and the resentment  towards  them  on
    the part  of  the  Sunnis  and  the  Kurds  in  particular  contributes
    adversely to the security situation in Iraq, and  particularly  in  the
    formerly contested areas.

247. The  wider  political  situation  in  Iraq  remains  of  concern.   The
    Disputed Territories remain disputed between the IKR and  the  GOI  and
    the  Kurdish  Independence  Referendum  in  September  2017  served  to
    increase tensions.  Some clashes between the Kurdish Peshmerga, the PMU
    and the ISF followed, with the result that most of  those  areas  which
    had been under the de facto control of the  IKR  fell  back  under  the
    control of the Iraqi government.  Kirkuk was retaken from the peshmerga
    by the PMU and the ISF in October 2017.  The impact of  the  referendum
    was considered in AAH (Iraq), which was considered five  months  or  so
    after the referendum took place.  The Tribunal noted  at  [7]  of  that
    decision that the situation had become "increasingly unstable following
    the September 2017 referendum".  Since then, we accept  the  submission
    made by the respondent at [72] and [73]  of  her  closing  submissions,
    which is that the general direction  in  more  recent  times  has  been
    towards rapprochement between the GOI and the IKR.  A  national  budget
    and an agreement on the unification of customs duties  were  agreed  in
    January 2019; Erbil airport was re-opened to international  flights  in
    November 2018 and there has been  some  co-operation  between  ISF  and
    Peshmerga forces operating outside the Kurdish areas.

248. We should also mention the May 2018 elections in  Iraq,  which  led  to
    Adel Abdul-Mahdi becoming Prime Minister.  As Dr Fatah reported in  his
    initial report, the elections were marred by reports of fraud.  He said
    in his oral evidence that there is  no  proper  democratic  process  in
    Iraq, 'only voting'.  The Prime Minister was selected as a  'compromise
    candidate' because of the lack of a clear majority.  He is not able  to
    oppose the political blocs or to  do  anything  without  their  consent
    because he has no  major  bloc  behind  him.   Dr  Fatah's  justifiable
    opinion, in these circumstances, is that this fragile situation  caries
    with it the risk of government shutdown in the  event  that  the  Prime
    Minister decided something which is  opposed  by  the  blocs.   In  the
    meantime, the opposition to the two main Kurdish political parties, the
    PUK and the KDP, has also increased and thousands of people took to the
    streets  in  2017  and  spring  2018  to  complain  about  a  lack   of
    transparency and accountability.  It might legitimately  be  said  that
    the political situation in the GOI and the IKR  is  unstable  and  that
    there is an uneasy truce between the two governments.

249.  We  now  turn  to  consider  the  security  situation  in   individual
    governorates against the backdrop of  the  observations  we  have  made
    about the situation in Iraq as a whole.  It will be necessary, in doing
    so,  to  consider  statistics  about  the  individual  governorate   in
    question.  For a quantitative overview of the security situation in the
    six governorates most affected by violence, however, another graph from
    the EASO on the general security situation  in  Iraq  provides  a  good
    starting point.  This graph is complied with UNAMI  figures  which,  as
    discussed above and in previous country guidance cases,  do  not  tally
    precisely  with  those  of  other  commentators  but  are  nevertheless
    reflective of  the  general  trend  in  those  governorates.   (We  are
    conscious of the fact that printed copies of this graph are unlikely to
    be in colour and it may assist the reader to know, therefore, that  the
    governorate  with  the  highest  number   of   civilians   killed   was
    consistently Salah al-Din and the governorate with the  lowest  numbers
    killed was consistently Anbar.)
                                    [pic]

250. In the EASO report, there is another UNAMI graph  showing  the  numbers
    of civilians injured in the same period.  The trend shown is the  same,
    although there are dramatic upward spikes in Ninewah from October  2016
    to July 2017, when the battle for Mosul was underway.  As can be  seen,
    the trend across all relevant areas is of  significant  and  continuous
    reduction  in  the  levels  of  violence.   With   those   introductory
    observations, we turn to  consider  the  situation  in  the  individual
    governorates, as informed by the totality of the material before us.

Kirkuk Governorate
251. All of Kirkuk governorate is disputed between the GOI and the IKR.   It
    is an ethnically diverse governorate which has seen  a  great  deal  of
    upheaval in recent decades.  We were struck by Dr Fatah's evidence that
    an individual who had lived in Kirkuk since the 1970's would have  seen
    it change hands several times.  Kirkuk City itself was never  taken  by
    ISIL although Hawija was, and Hawija was one of the last places in Iraq
    to be liberated,  in  October  2017.   The  battle  for  Hawija  caused
    significant damage to its infrastructure.  Since  control  over  Kirkuk
    was taken back from the peshmerga  in  the  aftermath  of  the  Kurdish
    Independence Referendum, the whole governorate  is  controlled  by  the
    ISF, with a significant presence of PMU militia.


252. ISIL controls no territory as such in  Kirkuk  governorate  but  it  is
    certainly present and active, particularly  in  the  areas  surrounding
    Hawija and the Hamrin Mountains.  There  are  pockets  of  fighters  in
    these areas, or permanently operating attack cells, as  they  are  also
    called in the background material.  We accept Dr Fatah's evidence  that
    around half a million people live in the areas  in  which  these  cells
    operate.

253. The statistics we have recorded above show a sharp fall in  the  number
    of civilians killed.  We recall just one of the datasets before us: IBC
    recorded 950 civilian deaths in the governorate in 2017, which fell  to
    276 in 2018.  The intensity fell from 62.9 civilians deaths per 100,000
    population in 2017 to 18.3 in 2018.

254. ISIL's main focus in Kirkuk is to  attack  specific  targets,  who  are
    usually  authority  figures  or  those  associated  with  the  security
    services.  More recently, as recorded in the Musings  blog,  they  have
    also been burning farms and agricultural infrastructure, and it is this
    activity which was responsible for the  increased  number  of  security
    incidents recorded in the blog in May 2019.  It is notable  that  there
    have been frequent attacks of this nature in  Kirkuk,  particularly  in
    the South West of the city, which is the area  nearest  to  the  Hamrin
    Mountain range, in which ISIL retains a constant presence despite  some
    ISF successes in locating and destroying their cells.  The  White  Flag
    group also operates there, although its activities are limited.

255. All commentators agree that ISIL is attempting  to  regain  control  of
    rural areas in this governorate.  Concerns have  been  expressed  about
    their attempts to regroup in the governorate.  The killing  of  village
    mukhtars and the attacks on farms are part of that  plan.   There  have
    also been skirmishes during the day time.  Civilians  have  undoubtedly
    been affected by the violence, particularly in rural areas, but also in
    Kirkuk city and during checkpoints attacks.  We note that EASO recorded
    one assessment as being that Hawija and Daquq  Districts  are  actually
    contested, due to the physical and psychological  pressure  exerted  by
    ISIL over the population.  Dr Fatah declined to use that label when  it
    was put to him, although he said that the situation was  bad  and  that
    the White Flags also continued to operate in the area.

256. There is a security vacuum in the rural parts of the governorate,  left
    by the departure of the peshmerga in late 2017.  ISIL has some  support
    in the region  and  has  been  able  to  move  freely  and  expand  its
    operations in the region as a result of that vacuum.  It is regarded as
    one of the core areas for ISIL's rebuilding efforts by  Joel  Wing  and
    other respected contributors.  We also accept the evidence given by  Dr
    Fatah about the effect of the PMU in Kirkuk governorate.   Whilst  they
    lessen the threat from ISIL in  the  region,  they  have  also  brought
    renewed sectarian tension, for instance by renaming  Sunni  sites  with
    Shia names.   The fact that Kirkuk remains a  Disputed  Territory  also
    contributes  to  the  uncertainty  experienced  by  residents  of   the
    Governorate.

257. The urban areas of Kirkuk and the transport links  which  connect  them
    therefore suffer primarily from targeted attacks against authority  and
    security figures which cause largely  unintended  civilian  casualties.
    The rural areas of Kirkuk suffer from targeted  attacks  of  a  similar
    type but also from a security vacuum which is exploited by ISIL and, to
    a much lesser extent, the White Flags.  The risk to  civilians  in  the
    rural areas is demonstrably higher, given ISIL's attempts to rebuild in
    those areas and the way in which they pursue that goal.   Nevertheless,
    we do not consider the proper application of the inclusive approach set
    out above to  justify  a  conclusion  the  level  of  violence  in  the
    governorate  reaches  the  Article  15(c)  threshold.   The  levels  of
    civilian casualties are not indicative of such a  threat,  standing  as
    they did at 276 amongst a population of 1.5 million in  2018.   Similar
    figures emerge from the 2019  evidence.   The  small  numbers  of  ISIL
    fighters are thinly spread, operating in small groups, and the scale of
    their activities is limited.  As at 23 May, 329,622 IDPs  had  returned
    to Kirkuk governorate according to Musings on Iraq.  We take account of
    indirect forms of violence, as required by HM2 and as  described  above
    but we do not consider that the level of risk to an  ordinary  civilian
    purely on account of his presence in Kirkuk, or any part of it, is such
    as to cross the Article 15(c) threshold.  The existence and actions  of
    permanently operating attacks cells, the coercion brought  to  bear  on
    sections of the rural  population  by  ISIL  and  the  other  forms  of
    indirect violence from ISIL and other groups (including  the  PMU)  are
    not  at  a  sufficiently  high  level  to  cross  that  threshold  when
    considered as a whole.

Ninewa Governorate
258. Approximately a third of Ninewa is disputed between  the  GOI  and  the
    IKR, including Sinjar in the north and the part which lies to the  east
    of the Tigris river in the east.  It is  the  most  ethnically  diverse
    governorate in Iraq.  Iraq's second city, Mosul, is in Ninewa.  It  was
    adopted as ISIL's capital from 2014 to the liberation of  the  city  in
    July 2017.  The battle for Mosul cost many lives.  It also resulted  in
    Western Mosul being razed to the ground by heavy artillery fire.   What
    remains of that part of the city is riddled  with  corpses,  unexploded
    ordinance and booby traps, although reconstruction  and  rehabilitation
    efforts on the part of the  Iraqi  authorities  and  the  international
    community are underway.  The devastation in Eastern Mosul, on the other
    side of the Tigris, was nowhere near  as  bad.   The  majority  of  the
    city's population of 1.5 million left and have  not  returned.   Sinjar
    and Baaj were also largely  destroyed  and  the  Yezidi  population  of
    Sinjar suffered some of the worst abuses during ISIL's occupation.


259. The threat from ISIL in Ninewa is higher than in Kirkuk.  We  note  and
    take seriously the view expressed by the US Consulate  and  USAID  that
    ISIL is viewed as a threat to the civilian population  in  Ninewa  (and
    elsewhere).  As in Kirkuk, it holds no territory as such but it has  an
    established presence of attack cells, some of which are  heavily  armed
    and well organised.  Dr Fatah and other commentators agree  that  there
    are relatively few incidents involving civilians and that ISIL is  more
    selective in its targets.  The focus remains on  targeting  figures  in
    military or authority positions.  There are nevertheless indicators  of
    a higher  threat  to  civilians  in  this  governorate,  including  the
    detonation of a truck bomb in a market, the emptying  of  villages  and
    ISIL attempts to impose taxes on villagers in rural  areas.   Parts  of
    the population are subjected to  physical  and  psychological  pressure
    from ISIL, particularly at night.  We are grateful to Dr Fatah for  his
    update on the recent developments in Makhmour, in which ISIL  are  said
    to have become increasingly brazen and have  been  burning  fields  and
    undertaking other activities in this remote region  in  an  attempt  to
    secure territory.


260. As with Kirkuk, the risk to civilians  from  ISIL  in  urban  areas  is
    different in character and magnitude to  that  faced  by  civilians  in
    rural areas, with the  latter  being  more  likely  to  encounter  ISIL
    pressure in one form or another, whereas the threat to civilians in the
    urban environment is mostly (but not exclusively) of inadvertent injury
    in a targeted attack.  We note that the threat to civilians  comes  not
    only from ISIL.  As in other parts of the formerly contested areas, the
    PMU are said to play a role  in  criminality  and  extortion  alongside
    their legitimate function.  And the insecurity in Ninewa is  compounded
    by the fact that part of it remain Disputed Territory between  the  GOI
    and the KRG.  We think Dr Fatah is correct  to  state  that  a  lasting
    political solution is needed in order to bring stability to Ninewa  and
    to Iraq as a whole.


261. Dr Fatah and other commentators agree, however, that ISIL  presence  in
    the governorate is not unchecked.  The Iraqi army  is  present  in  the
    governorate in large numbers. As we have recorded, five of  the  recent
    security incidents Dr Fatah recorded in his first report  were  all  of
    ISIL clearance operations carried out by  the  ISF  and  its  partners.
    Ninewa Operations Command are aware of ISIL's increased rural  activity
    in the governorate and are taking steps to address it.  A large  number
    of IDPs (1.6  million)  have  returned  to  the  region.   Despite  the
    targeted attacks on authority figures,  governors  and  civil  servants
    have begun to work again in the region, which Dr  Fatah  agreed  was  a
    positive sign.  The statistics which we have  set  out  above  are  not
    indicative of a high  level  of  threat  to  the  civilian  population:
    amongst a population of 3.7 million, IBC recorded 1596 civilian  deaths
    in 2018 (although we consider that number to have been inflated by  the
    discovery of mass graves from the ISIL era in  the  governorate  during
    the reporting period)  and  the  intensity  of  violence  is  at  46.46
    civilian  deaths  per  100,000  of  the  population.   In   2017,   the
    corresponding figures were 9211 civilian deaths  and  an  intensity  of
    265.15 per 100,000.  Considering the evidence as a whole, and  adopting
    the inclusive approach from HM2, we do not consider that there is  such
    a high level of indiscriminate violence there that substantial  grounds
    exist for believing that an ordinary civilian would,  solely  by  being
    present there, face a real risk which threatens  his  life  or  person.
    The risk of actual or indirect  violence  to  civilians  in  Ninewa  is
    higher than elsewhere but it nevertheless falls short  of  the  Article
    15(c) threshold.

Salah al Din Governorate
262. Salah al-Din is a predominantly  Sunni  governorate,  and  its  capital
    Tikrit was the birthplace of  Saddam  Hussein.   Only  its  easternmost
    section, which includes Tuz Khurmato is disputed between  the  GOI  and
    the IKR.  Small parts of the governorate fell to ISIL but  control  was
    quickly regained, with ISIL forced out of the  key  centres  (including
    the significant city of Baiji) by mid 2015.  These battles nevertheless
    caused significant  infrastructure  damage  in  certain  parts  of  the
    governorate.  In Dr Fatah's opinion, as shared with Joel  Wing  of  the
    Musings  on  Iraq  blog,  ISIL  has  reduced  its  operations  in  this
    governorate to focus on the insurgency in other areas.   The  reduction
    in ISIL attacks from 84 per month in 2017 to 14.2  per  month  in  2018
    would certainly support that theory.


263. Problems remain, however.  Tuz  Khurmato  saw  heavy  violence  in  the
    aftermath of the  Independence  Referendum  and  has  suffered  serious
    damage.  Violence continued into 2018.  It is now ruled by  a  powerful
    Shia militia and, as Dr Fatah stated, the  problems  which  remain  are
    essentially of an ethnic nature, with Kurds in that area more likely to
    face difficulty  from  the  controlling  PMU.   We  accept  Dr  Fatah's
    evidence that Salah al-Din is one of the governorates in which there is
    particular resentment to the presence of Shia  militia,  since  it  was
    formerly the seat of Sunni power in the country.  This is a governorate
    in which Shia control is  most  acutely  felt,  with  Dr  Fatah  giving
    examples of the Kurdish flag being  removed  and  a  university's  name
    being changed by the Shias.

264. As elsewhere, the majority of ISIL  activity  is  specifically  focused
    towards security and authority figures.  Dr Fatah again used  the  word
    'selective' on more than one occasion  during  his  oral  evidence  and
    accepted that their activities were limited by the presence of the PMUs
    in the governorate.  He gave the example of civilians being killed at a
    checkpoint if ISIL mounted an attack on the security forces controlling
    it, stating that mass attacks were no longer a phenomenon.

265. There is some evidence of  coercive  behaviour  on  the  part  of  ISIL
    towards the rural population in  Salah  al-Din.   The  Hamrin  Mountain
    Range extends into Salah al Din and  there  are  militants  permanently
    stationed  in  that  rugged  terrain,  who  exert  some  physical   and
    psychological control over the population, including the imposition  of
    zaqat, or taxes, on the population.  Salah al-Din also contains what is
    described in the EASO report (attributed to the Institute for the Study
    of War in January 2019) as ISIL's only area of 'doctrinal control',  as
    manifested by prisons,  judicial  proceedings,  organised  worship  and
    training camps.  Asked  about  this  area,  which  is  in  the  Makhoul
    Mountains of Baiji District, Dr Fatah was dismissive, stating  that  it
    was "only villages".  At Appendix D, we have appended a map[7] from the
    Washington-based Institute for the Study of War ("ISW") in  which  this
    small area is visible as a grave accent over the city of Baiji.

266. The metrics for the governorate  are  not  indicative  of  a  level  of
    threat which  engages  Article  15(c)  in  general.   The  IBC  figures
    recorded 152 civilian deaths out of  a  population  of  more  than  1.5
    million in 2018.  The intensity of the violence was considerably  lower
    than in Ninewa, for example, standing at 10.05  per  100,000  in  2018,
    marking a reduction from 28.05 in 100,000 in 2017.  Vast  numbers  have
    returned to the governorate and it is clear that  the  authorities  are
    taking regular action in the area to continue the pressure on ISIL.  We
    also take account of  indirect  forms  of  violence,  particularly  the
    assassination of local authority figures; the coercion exerted by  ISIL
    on sections of the rural population in particular;  and  the  sectarian
    tensions which persist across  the  governorate  (in  Tuz  Khurmato  in
    particular).  We do not consider, however, that  an  ordinary  civilian
    faces  such  a  high  level  of  indiscriminate  violence  there   that
    substantial grounds exist for believing that he would, solely by  being
    present there, face a real risk which threatens his life or person.

267. The one exception to that  general  conclusion  is  the  geographically
    small area in rural Baiji which we have identified above as being under
    the doctrinal control of ISIL, as marked on the ISW  map.   We  see  no
    reason to doubt what is asserted in the EASO report  in  this  respect,
    and consider that the position has changed from that described at  [95]
    of the respondent's closing submissions (which  refers  to  the  Danish
    Immigration Service stating that ISIL controls no territory in Ninewa).
    Insofar as the respondent made  submissions  about  such  control,  her
    stance was that there was no evidence of an actual threat  to  life  or
    person  there.   We  accept  that  submission  but  the  inference   is
    irresistible.  If ISIL is in control  of  the  area  and  is  operating
    parallel  judicial  systems,  prisons  and  training  camps  there,  we
    consider it more likely than not (given the group's behaviour from 2014-
    2017) that the situation in that very specific area  is  one  in  which
    there is such a high level of indiscriminate violence that  a  civilian
    would face a real risk which threatens his life  or  person  solely  be
    being present there.

Diyala Governorate
268. Parts of Diyala fell under the control of ISIL during for  only  around
    six months, and it was brought back under government control  in  early
    2015.  Security operations have continued in the  region  after  ISIL's
    military defeat and the evidence as a whole shows  that  Dr  Fatah  was
    correct to accept Mr Thomann's suggestions that Iraqi forces  had  been
    relatively successful in their counter-insurgency  operations.   It  is
    unsurprising, given the proximity of  Diyala  to  Baghdad,  that  there
    should be a focus on counter insurgency in this  area.   The  PMUs  are
    particularly  powerful  in  this  area,  and  the  Iranian-backed  Badr
    Organisation is considered to be the main security actor.


269. The  Hamrin  Mountain  range  extends  into  Diyala,  however,  and  it
    continues to operate as a base from  which  ISIL  can  mount  insurgent
    activities.  The respondent quite  rightly  accepts  at  [110]  of  her
    closing submissions that there is evidence of ISIL hideouts and sleeper
    cells in Diyala.  The comparative sophistication of their installations
    was revealed in February 2018, when a complex  with  solar  electricity
    was discovered in the mountains.

270. Khanaqin and Kifri have been particularly targeted in recent times  and
    there was notable violence in Khanaqin around  the  time  of  the  2018
    elections.  The estimated number of ISIL  fighters  in  the  region  is
    between 75 and 200.  The general trend in Diyala is as elsewhere,  with
    the group being selective in the targets selected, and preferring  'hit
    and  run'  attacks  on  authority  and  security  figures.    31   such
    individuals were killed in 2018.  More so than in  other  governorates,
    however, there is some evidence of intentional attacks on the  civilian
    population by ISIL.  There  are  reports  of  fake  checkpoints,  zaqat
    demands and extortion perpetrated by ISIL on rural communities.


271. Dr Fatah's opinion that the ethnically heterogenous  nature  of  Diyala
    makes it more prone to instability is  amply  supported  by  the  other
    material before us.  As in other parts of the Disputed Territories, the
    withdrawal of Kurdish forces in the aftermath  of  the  Referendum  has
    left a security vacuum in certain parts of the governorate.   The  ISIL
    presence in the west of the governorate is greater, since that is where
    the highest concentration of Sunnis is to be found.

272. Michael Knights considers ISIL to 'rule the  night'  in  certain  rural
    parts of Diyala and ISW assesses a number of districts to be contested,
    including Khanaqin and Kifri.  We remind ourselves that the statistical
    data are of prime importance in assessing the level of  threat  to  the
    civilian population, however, and we do not consider  the  IBC  figures
    for 2018 to be indicative of a high level of threat.   In  2018,  there
    were 256 civilian deaths amongst a population of more than 1.6  million
    and an intensity of violence of 16.4 civilians killed  per  100,000  of
    the population.  The more recent data from Musings  on  Iraq  shows  no
    significant or sustained variation in 2019.  As in other parts  of  the
    formerly contested areas, significant numbers  of  IDPs  have  returned
    home in Diyala.  There are undoubtedly indicators of indirect violence,
    which we take into account pursuant to the inclusive approach  required
    by HM2 but we do not consider that that an ordinary civilian faces such
    a high level of indiscriminate violence in  any  part  of  Diyala  that
    substantial grounds exist for believing that he would, solely by  being
    present there, face a real risk which threatens  his  life  or  person.
    Although certain parts of the governorate - Khanaqin  in  particular  -
    have higher levels of ISIL activity, we do not consider that the  scale
    of those operations, even when set against  the  assessed  against  the
    instability in the area, reaches the Article  15(c)  threshold  in  the
    generality of cases.

Anbar Governorate
273. Anbar is not part of the Disputed Territories, lying as it does on  the
    western side of Iraq, away from the IKR.   70%  of  it  was  contested,
    however, and AA (Iraq) was heard very shortly after the city of  Ramadi
    fell to the militants.  The governorate was reclaimed gradually and  it
    was at the point that Raqa was liberated, at the end of 2017, that  the
    government announced the military  defeat  of  ISIL.   The  governorate
    suffered extensive destruction during this protracted process  and,  as
    in Mosul and other areas, houses in reclaimed areas were booby  trapped
    by ISIL as they left.


274. The Musings on Iraq blog  recently  described  Anbar  as  a  'secondary
    front' for ISIL and that description is consistent with the rest of the
    evidence before us, including that of Dr Fatah.  That  is  not  to  say
    that the group has been eliminated from the area altogether.  There was
    a recent upsurge in violence, as Dr Fatah and the Musings on Iraq  blog
    both recount, but the area is not thought by any commentators to  be  a
    core area for ISIL activity.  It is clear that the huge desert areas in
    Anbar continue to host a number of militants, and it continues to be an
    entry point from Syria, which  shares  a  lengthy  border  with  Anbar.
    Whilst the scale of their activities is  more  limited  than  in  other
    parts of the formerly contested areas, the nature of their  tactics  is
    similar.  They tend to target security figures in particular,  although
    civilians have been killed in security incidents in 2019.


275. There is a  large  PMU  presence  in  Anbar  and  there  are  extensive
    operations against the  remaining  pockets  of  ISIL  fighters  in  the
    region.  The largely Shia PMU presence in all of Anbar's cities  causes
    friction with the largely Sunni population of the governorate, however,
    and there have been credible reports of serious  abuses  against  Sunni
    civilians by the militia.

276. The IBC data does not indicate a serious threat to the life  or  person
    of civilians in Anbar.  In a governorate of approximately 1.7  million,
    there were 86 civilian deaths in 2018, down from 761 in  the  preceding
    year.  The intensity of civilian deaths was considerably lower in Anbar
    than in the other governorates considered above, standing  at  5.1  per
    100,000 of the population in 2018.  1.3 million people have returned to
    Anbar according to Joel Wing in late May 2019.  The ISF, including  the
    PMU, continue to exert pressure on the militants.   Challenges  clearly
    remain in the area, and we take those  into  account  as  part  of  the
    inclusive approach.  The largely Sunni civilians from this  governorate
    face some risk from the Shia militia in addition  to  the  remnants  of
    ISIL  and  this  is  a  governorate  in  which  ethnic   tensions   are
    particularly apparent.  Significant humanitarian concerns remain but we
    do not consider the population of any part of Anbar to live  under  the
    shadow of violence to an extent which  engages  Article  15(c)  in  the
    generality of cases.

Baghdad and the Baghdad Belts
277. The vast majority of the population  of  Baghdad  governorate  live  in
    Baghdad City.  In AA (Iraq), the Upper Tribunal stated  at  [119]  that
    the population of the city was around 6.5 million and the population of
    the governorate was just under 6.7 million, according to the UN's Joint
    Analysis Unit.


278. It will be recalled that the extant country guidance from AA (Iraq)  is
    that the Article 15(c) threshold  will  not  generally  be  reached  in
    relation to Baghdad City but that certain areas of the Baghdad Belts do
    reach that threshold.  In relation to Baghdad City, we  can  state  our
    conclusions shortly.  The sources before us speak with one voice  about
    the security situation in the city.  There is no  proper  justification
    in the 2018 and 2019 evidence for the statement  in  Dr  Fatah's  first
    report that the risk to all  civilians  in  Baghdad  is  high.   As  he
    accepted in response to the respondent's written questions, the  number
    of security incidents in Baghdad fell from 184 in January 2017 to 4  in
    March 2019.  It  is  justifiably  described  by  Joel  Wing  as  ISIL's
    forgotten area.  There is very limited ISIL activity in the capital and
    the actions of the Iraqi state in  opening  the  previously  restricted
    Green Zone to the public at the end of last year speak volumes.  Whilst
    the Institute for the Study of War considers that ISIL remains  capable
    of mounting attacks in the centre, there is very little such  activity.
    The mortar attack reported in Joel Wing's 22-28 May blog was the  first
    such attack for months.  It is understandable that the UNHCR's May 2019
    guidance  refers  to  the  situation   in   Baghdad   having   'largely
    stabilised'.

279. As all sources recognise,  there  are  other  sources  of  conflict  in
    Baghdad, particularly in relation to politics and sectarian  divisions.
    It is those divisions which have led to Baghdad becoming a city divided
    on  sectarian  lines,  as  Dr  Fatah   explained   in   his   evidence.
    Nevertheless, the statistics reveal a sharp decline in  the  number  of
    casualties and in the intensity  of  violence.   In  a  governorate  of
    nearly 7 million people, there were 566 civilian deaths in  2018,  down
    from 1032 in the preceding year.  The intensity of civilians killed per
    100,000 of the population was 7.36 in 2018.  Neither  that  number  nor
    the qualitative indications of indirect violence in Baghdad itself give
    any reason to depart from the ultimate conclusion reached in AA  (Iraq)
    about the risk to civilians in Baghdad governorate.  On  the  contrary,
    the situation in the governorate is actually considerably safer that it
    was when AA (Iraq) was decided.

280. The Baghdad 'Belts' are helpfully defined at [138] of AA (Iraq) in  the
    following way:

         residential, agricultural, and industrial areas that  encircle  the
         city of Baghdad, as well as the "networks of roadways, rivers,  and
         other lines of communication that lie within  a  twenty  or  thirty
         mile radius of Baghdad and connect the capital to the rest of Iraq.
         Beginning in the north, the  belts  include  the  cities  of  Taji,
         clockwise  to  Tarmiyah,  Baqubah  [Diyala  governorate]  ,  Buhriz
         [Diyala  governorate]  ,  Besmayah   and   Nahrwan,   Salman   Pak,
         Mahmudiyah, Sadr al-Yusufiyah, Fallujah [Anbar governorate]  ,  and
         Karmah [Anbar governorate] .  This  "clock"  can  be  divided  into
         quadrants: Northeast, Southeast, Southwest, and Northwest".

281. The security situation in the Belts has changed dramatically  since  AA
    (Iraq) was decided.  It is likely, in our view, that this  is  for  the
    reason suggested in the report  from  the  Swedish  Migration  Agency's
    Country of Origin Information Agency ("Lifos") to which  Dr  Fatah  was
    referred by Mr Thomann; a  new  Operations  Commander  in  Baghdad  had
    focused on the Belts and, in any event, ISIL largely withdrew from  the
    area at the time of the  battle  for  Mosul.   That  accords  with  the
    assessment of the UNHCR in May 2019.  Dr Fatah accepted that the trends
    in the Baghdad Belts were the same as in Baghdad itself and he accepted
    that the situation in the Belts was more stable.  As in AA  (Iraq),  at
    [146], our conclusion in respect of the Baghdad Belts overlaps with the
    conclusions we have drawn above.  The situation in Baghdad  governorate
    does not engage Article 15(c) in the generality of cases, nor does  the
    situation in Diyala or Anbar.  Whilst there is some  ISIL  activity  in
    those areas, and therefore in the Baghdad Belts, it does  not  reach  a
    level of intensity at which it can properly be  said  that  a  civilian
    would, solely on account of his presence in that area, face a threat to
    his life or person which requires the  United  Kingdom  to  afford  him
    subsidiary protection under the Directive.


General Conclusions - Article 15(c)
282. We have taken the extant country guidance in AA (Iraq) as our  starting
    point.  We have taken all of the evidence before us  into  account  and
    have applied the inclusive approach  required  by  the  authorities  to
    which we have referred.  The evidence  before  us  indicates  that  the
    situation in the formerly contested areas  and  the  Baghdad  Belts  is
    fundamentally different from that which obtained in 2015.  ISIL was  in
    control of a third of the country at that time, and was in the  process
    of perpetrating genocide and ethnic cleansing on a historic scale.   It
    was rightly accepted by the respondent at that time that the  situation
    in the contested areas  engaged  Article  15(c)  of  the  Qualification
    Directive in the  generality  of  cases.   ISIL  was  finally  defeated
    militarily in 2017. With the exception of one small mountainous area in
    Baiji, ISIL holds no territory in Iraq.  ISIL's activities in Iraq have
    changed fundamentally in method and scale.  Its focus is no  longer  on
    the civilian population but primarily on  authority  figures  or  those
    connected with the security apparatus.


283. Mr Bazini asked us to attach particular significance to the  number  of
    areas in which ISIL are known  to  have  permanently  operating  attack
    cells and in which they are said to 'rule the night'.  We decline to do
    so.   With  the  exception  of  the  small  mountainous  area  we  have
    identified, the scale of ISIL's actual operations - even in  the  worst
    affected rural areas to which these comments attach in  the  background
    material - do not justify a conclusion that there is a general  Article
    15(c) threat in those areas.

284. On behalf of the first and second appellants,  it  was  submitted  that
    the fact that the UNHCR had identified  so  many  different  groups  as
    being potentially at  risk  in  Iraq[8]  was  an  indication  that  the
    situation generally, and in the formerly contested areas in particular,
    reached the Article 15(c) standard.  We consider that submission to  be
    misconceived.  The fact that specific groups or those  with  particular
    profiles might be at particular risk in Iraq cannot establish that  the
    baseline threat crosses the Article 15(c) threshold.

285. ISIL presents one of the dangers to  the  ordinary  civilian  in  Iraq,
    which continues to suffer from sectarian tension, political insecurity,
    large scale displacement and extensive humanitarian need, all of  which
    are inflamed by the Iranian-backed PMU which assisted the ISF (and  the
    peshmerga) in the defeat of ISIL.  Nevertheless, in the worst  affected
    governorate (Ninewa), the intensity of the violence in  2018  stood  at
    46.46 civilians killed per 100,000 of  the  population,  which  is  not
    indicative of a general level of threat which  engages  Article  15(c).
    The level of threat varies considerably by region, and is most acute in
    the rural parts of the Formerly Contested Area.   With  one  exception,
    however, we do not consider that the risk to an ordinary civilian, even
    in parts of those territories in which ISIL exerts a degree of physical
    and psychological control over the population, is  such  as  to  engage
    Article 15(c) in the generality of cases.  The evidence  clearly  shows
    that the degree of indiscriminate violence characterising  the  current
    armed conflict taking place in Baghdad, Diyala, Kirkuk, Ninewah,  Salah
    Al-Din and Anbar is not at such a high level that  substantial  grounds
    have been shown for believing that any civilian  returned  there  would
    solely on account of his presence there face a real risk of a threat to
    his life or person.

286. The one exception to the conclusion above is in  respect  of  the  area
    north of Baiji, in which ISIL is  reliably  said  to  be  in  doctrinal
    control of a small mountainous area.  In respect of that area,  we  are
    satisfied that the Article 15(c) threshold is met in the generality  of
    cases.

287. We are satisfied that the changes  we  have  detailed  above  are  well
    established and durable and that the previous country  guidance  in  AA
    (Iraq) requires revision in accordance with the conclusions above.  The
    principal threat to civilians at the time of  that  guidance  was  from
    ISIL's occupation of a third of the  country  and  the  horrific  human
    rights abuses experienced by civilians as a result of that  occupation.
    The occupation has come to an  end,  as  have  the  wide-ranging  human
    rights abuses.  The evidence does not establish (and Dr  Fatah  refused
    to suggest) that ISIL are on the verge of a  return.   History,  common
    sense and informed opinion suggest that  any  such  resurgence  is  not
    foreseeable.  ISIL numbers  are  currently  at  10-25%  of  their  2014
    numbers and recruitment is unlikely to be as easy for the group  as  it
    was previously, due to its heavy losses  on  the  battlefield  and  its
    alienation of the Iraqi population.  There is a large PMU  presence  in
    the Formerly Contested Areas  and  it  is  unlikely  to  leave  in  the
    foreseeable future.  The ISF continues to target the militants  in  the
    areas in the remote areas in which they are now  concentrated.   As  Dr
    Fatah put it, the ISF and the PMU maintain a 'boot on  the  throat'  of
    the militants, preventing  any  general  resurgence.   The  disaffected
    Sunni population of these areas remains disaffected but is unlikely  to
    swell the ranks of ISIL, or to provide significant support, because  it
    has experienced the brutality of life in the former so-called caliphate
    and is 'ideologically vaccinated' against the group.


288. We note and accept a view consistently made by Dr  Fatah  and  endorsed
    by the UNHCR, which was that the Iraqi government has failed to find  a
    lasting political solution to  the  problems  which  enabled  the  ISIL
    insurgency to take root in Iraq.  The alienation  of  the  Sunnis,  the
    ongoing (although somewhat eased) tension over the Disputed Territories
    and the malign influence of Iran all  simmer  beneath  the  surface  in
    Iraq.  But we consider the significance of this point to be  overstated
    at [3] and [58] of the appellants' conjoined skeleton and  at  [52]  of
    the first and second appellant's written submissions.  What is required
    by MST (Ethiopia) and  the  authorities  considered  within  it,  is  a
    durable  and  evidentially  well-established  change  to  the   country
    situation.  For the reasons we have set out above, there has been  such
    a change in Iraq and in the formerly  contested  areas  in  particular,
    even if Iraq is very far from being  a  settled  and  peaceful  country
    which has found a lasting political  solution  to  the  full  range  of
    difficulties it has throughout its troubled history.  It is  a  durable
    change, rather than a complete and final resolution of all the problems
    in the country, which justifies amendment to the country guidance.   We
    agree with the respondent's submissions in this regard.

289. We acknowledge that there is a risk of an  alternative  militant  group
    forming as a result of sectarian conflict in these areas,  particularly
    as a result of PMU activity towards the Sunni population.  There is  no
    evidence of such a group forming at present, however, and  we  consider
    the risk to be too remote to contribute materially to our assessment of
    the situation at present.  The small White Flag group, of  which  there
    is some mention in the material before us, is not such a  group,  since
    its primary motive appears to be financial and its primary activity  is
    stealing oil from pipelines.


Enhanced Risk Categories
290. Our principal conclusion is (with  the  exception  we  have  identified
    above) that the situation in the areas presently under consideration is
    not one in which the degree of indiscriminate violence  is  at  such  a
    high level that substantial grounds are  shown  for  believing  that  a
    civilian, returned to those parts of Iraq, would, solely on account  of
    his presence there, face a real risk of being subject to that threat.


291. As explained in Elgafaji and QD (Iraq), however, it is necessary  as  a
    result of the individualised assessment required by Article 4(3)(c)  of
    the  Qualification  Directive,  to  consider  whether   an   individual
    applicant might be able to show that he  is  specifically  affected  by
    reason of factors particular to  his  personal  circumstances.   In  HF
    (Iraq) [2013] EWCA Civ 1276; [2014] 1 WLR 1329,  Elias  LJ  (with  whom
    Fulford and Maurice Kay LJJ agreed) explained  the  operation  of  this
    'sliding scale' in this way: "where a person can show  that  he  is  at
    risk of being specifically targeted because of  factors  particular  to
    his personal circumstances, this will lower the level of indiscriminate
    violence necessary to attract humanitarian protection.": [9].

292.  In  this  section  of  our  decision,  therefore,  we  consider  which
    particular factors might engage the sliding scale in this way.   Before
    we do so, we note that there is potentially  significant  overlap  with
    the Refugee Convention, in that an individual who is at risk  of  being
    specifically targeted because of factors  particular  to  his  personal
    circumstances might well be deserving  of  protection  under  the  1951
    Convention on that account.  It must, in other words, be recalled  that
    a person who is at risk of persecutory  ill  treatment  on  account  of
    their race, religion, nationality, membership of  a  particular  social
    group   or   political   opinion   is,   subject   to    countervailing
    considerations, a refugee whose appeal falls  to  be  allowed  on  that
    basis.  A decision maker who  is  minded  to  conclude,  say,  that  an
    individual with an actual or perceived association with  ISIL  is  more
    likely to be exposed to conditions contrary to Article 15(c)  would  be
    well advised to consider whether, in reality, it  should  be  the  1951
    Convention and not the Qualification Directive which should provide the
    appropriate protection against return.  The UNHCR makes the same  point
    at footnote 711 of its May 2019 document, as did  the  European  Asylum
    Support Office, at page 24 of its 2014  Judicial  Analysis  on  Article
    15(c) QD: "if 'personal circumstances' are [membership of a  particular
    social group] or any of the other four  grounds  of  the  1951  Refugee
    Convention, then the appropriate framework to  examine  the  claim  may
    well be that of the refugee definition".


293. It was originally submitted in writing, on  behalf  of  the  first  and
    second appellants, that we should provide guidance on  the  entitlement
    of various categories of  individuals  to  protection  under  the  1951
    Convention.  Mr Knafler subsequently accepted orally and in his closing
    written submissions, however, that such  protection  fell  outside  the
    scope of our analysis.  It was nevertheless submitted on behalf of  the
    appellants, at [98]-[115] of their opening skeleton, that there were no
    fewer than seventeen personal characteristics which might  be  relevant
    to the sliding  scale  analysis  under  Article  15(c).  The  list  was
    compiled, as we understand it, by taking the "Main Categories of Claim"
    from the UNHCR's May 2019 guidance and expanding upon it,  particularly
    by adding additional categories of individuals  who  appear  to  be  at
    enhanced risk as a result of the EASO  reports.   The  list  which  was
    given in the skeleton was as follows (reproduced verbatim):

        i) Civilians perceived to be supporting ISIS
       ii) Families/Tribes Associated/Affiliated with actual  or  perceived
           ISIS members
      iii) Persons providing legal  services  to  ISIS  suspects  or  their
           families so affiliated (perceived or real)
       iv) Persons associated/perceived as supportive of the government
        v) Persons opposing (perceived or real) the government/KRG or those
           so affiliated.
       vi) Members of religious and  minority  ethnic  groups  and  persons
           contravening strict Islamic rules
      vii)   Journalists/media   professionals   engaging    in    critical
           reporting/sensitive issues.
     viii) Humanitarian/Medical Workers
       ix) Women/girls with certain profiles or in specified circumstances
        x) Children with certain profiles/specific circumstances
       xi) Persons of diverse sexual orientation and/or gender identities
      xii) Individuals targeted as part of Tribal conflict/Blood feuds
     xiii) Palestinians
      xiv) Business owners/those perceived as wealthy
       xv) Perceived collaborators of Western organisations/armed forces
      xvi) People with disabilities
     xvii) People displaying westernised behaviour

294. The respondent accepts that the following categories of individual  are
    at enhanced risk: civilians perceived to  be  supportive  of  ISIL  and
    families or  tribes  associated  with  ISIL;  persons  associated  with
    central government, the PMU or those in civilian leadership  positions;
    and civilians returning to areas in  which  ISIL  retains  a  presence.
    Broadly,  therefore,  the  respondent  accepts  that  the  first   five
    categories identified by the appellants are at enhanced  risk  for  the
    purposes of the sliding scale assessment.  The respondent  also  enters
    caveats in respect of each category.  In respect of Sunni  Arab  males,
    she highlights that the background evidence no longer suggests,  as  it
    did around 2017, a widespread practice  of  the  PMUs  targeting  these
    individuals at checkpoints.  In respect of those in civilian leadership
    positions and  those  returning  to  areas  in  which  ISIL  retains  a
    presence, the respondent highlights the considerable reduction in  ISIL
    activity and the corresponding reduction in risk to such individuals.


295. In respect of the remaining categories, the  respondent  simply  states
    at [132] of her closing submissions that  these  categories  are  'more
    appropriately considered under the Refugee Convention'  and  that  they
    are consequently beyond the  scope  of  the  current  Country  Guidance
    assessment.  We consider that to be correct, but only to a point.  Each
    of the categories identified by the appellants is capable  of  engaging
    the Refugee Convention, mostly  on  the  basis  of  actual  or  imputed
    political opinion or membership  of  a  particular  social  group.   An
    individual who falls for consideration under Article  15(c)  will  have
    been adjudged not to be  deserving  of  protection  under  the  Refugee
    Convention.  That does not mean that these factors necessarily cease to
    be of relevance when assessing eligibility for  subsidiary  protection.
    A characteristic might, in other words, serve  to  enhance  risk  under
    Article 15(c) even though it is insufficient in itself  to  entitle  an
    individual to protection under the 1951 Convention.  We have  therefore
    evaluated the categories advanced by the  appellants  with  a  view  to
    providing some guidance on  the  bearing  that  the  presence  of  such
    factors might have on the sliding scale analysis  required  by  Article
    15(c).  Given the limited  submission  advanced  by  the  Secretary  of
    State, we note that we have not had the benefit  of  full  argument  on
    each of the categories.

296. The first three categories fall  under  the  heading  'persons  wrongly
    suspected of supporting ISIS' in the UNHCR  guidance.   Insofar  as  it
    might  have  been  thought  in  the  past  that   Sunni   males   would
    automatically fall under suspicion of ISIL sympathy, we agree with  the
    respondent that that is no longer the case.  It is  apparent  from  the
    background material, however,  that  an  individual  might  fall  under
    suspicion of ISIL support for the most tenuous  of  reasons  including,
    for example, the fact that they remained in an ISIL-controlled area for
    a period of time (even though ISIL often inflicted harsh punishment  on
    those who attempted to leave).  Equally, there is unfortunately a clear
    basis  in  the  background  material  for  the  suggestion  that  those
    providing legal services to  ISIL  suspects  or  their  families  might
    encounter difficulties on account of such actions.  Suspicion  of  ISIL
    activity or association may place an individual at  risk,  particularly
    from the PMU and particularly at checkpoints, where it  is  clear  that
    individual security actors maintain  their  own  lists  of  individuals
    thought to have an ISIL association.  Whilst we  understand  the  basis
    upon which the appellants' representatives  have  attempted  to  define
    with greater specificity the types of individuals who might fall  under
    such suspicion, we think it preferable not to do so and simply to state
    that those who are suspected of supporting  ISIL  for  whatever  reason
    might be at enhanced risk for the purposes of Article 15(c).   Decision
    makers will wish to recall  that  those  who  actually  supported  ISIL
    might, as a result of a fact-specific enquiry into  their  actions,  be
    excluded from the protection  of  the  Refugee  Convention  or  Article
    15(c).


297. Categories (iv) to (xiii) are taken from the UNHCR  guidance,  although
    the appellants have sought to modify the UNHCR's mode of expression  in
    parts.  It is necessary to consider each of these proposed  categories,
    since we consider that some revision of the appellants'  proposed  list
    is necessary.

298. Those who are associated with  national  or  local  government  or  the
    security apparatus, or  perceived  to  be  so,  are  likely  to  be  at
    increased risk in those areas in which ISIL retains  a  presence.   The
    respondent accepts that to be the case, albeit  that  she  phrases  her
    acceptance in slightly different terms from the appellants.  The  areas
    in which such targeting is likely to  take  place,  and  the  types  of
    individuals targeted,  will  be  apparent  from  our  analysis  of  the
    Formerly Contested Areas.  In  various  parts  of  those  areas,  those
    associated with local government (such as village mukhtars) may  be  at
    particular risk from ISIL remnants which continue to  operate.   It  is
    imperative that any claim to be at enhanced risk  for  this  reason  is
    evaluated by reference to the area of return.  A  village  mukhtar  who
    returns to a part of the Formerly Contested Areas in which ISIL remains
    active might be at increased risk, whereas a comparable individual  who
    returns to a  part  of  the  country  with  negligible  remaining  ISIL
    presence would  not  be.   Given  ISIL's  current  modus  operandi,  we
    consider that a current actual or perceived association with government
    or the security apparatus is more likely to enhance risk than a  former
    association.   ISIL's  primary  goal  is  to  unsettle   the   existing
    apparatus, rather than to punish former association.

299. Those who are opposed, or perceived to be opposed,  to  the  Government
    of Iraq or the Kurdistan Regional Government may be at enhanced risk on
    return to territory controlled by those bodies.  A detailed analysis is
    beyond the scope of this decision but there are credible  reports,  for
    example, of journalists  who  are  critical  of  the  KRG  encountering
    difficulties as a result.  There is also evidence of  such  intolerance
    on the part of the authorities in Baghdad, albeit to a  lesser  extent.
    As noted in Mr Thomann's cross-examination of Dr Fatah, the examples he
    gave in his report of such targeting were limited and outdated  but  it
    was not suggested by Mr Thomann that criticism of  the  authorities  is
    wholly tolerated.  The background evidence including  the  recent  EASO
    report would not have supported such a submission.  The  fact  that  an
    individual is so opposed might serve to enhance the  risk  of  specific
    targeting which is relevant to the assessment under Article 15(c), even
    where that risk is insufficient to  found  a  claim  under  the  Refuge
    Convention.

300. Members of religious and minority ethnic groups are considered  by  the
    UNHCR to be likely to be in need of international refugee protection in
    areas where ISIL retains a presence.  As we have underlined  throughout
    this decision, we emphasise our appreciation of UNHCR's unique position
    and expertise in such matters.  There is some danger  in  applying  too
    broad a brush in trying to describe this cohort,  however.   The  first
    danger is in the use of the word 'minority' in the context of Iraq.  As
    we have endeavoured to explain, the ethno-religious demography of  Iraq
    is varied by region.  Whilst Sunni Arabs are in the minority across the
    country as a whole, for example, there are areas in which they comprise
    the majority.  The same might also be said in  respect  of  the  Kurds.
    The second difficulty is to assume or potentially  to  assume  that  an
    ethnic group is at a disadvantage because it is  statistically  in  the
    minority in a particular area.  Whilst such an  assumption  might  have
    been proper in the past, the proliferation of the PMUs has altered  the
    balance of power in particular areas, often to  the  detriment  of  the
    majority.  It was a familiar theme  in  Dr  Fatah's  written  and  oral
    evidence, for example, that the  Shia  militia  had  in  certain  areas
    renamed buildings and taken down Kurdish symbols. The third  danger  is
    in treating the presence or absence of ISIL from an area  as  a  binary
    concept.  As we have explained at some length  above,  ISIL  retains  a
    presence in a number of areas  but  the  size  and  influence  of  that
    presence, and ISIL's levels of activity, vary significantly.   Whenever
    it is submitted that an individual is at enhanced risk on  this  basis,
    therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the submission  with  particular
    care, with reference to the composition of the area  in  question,  the
    local balance of power and the extent of ISIL activity in the  area  in
    question.  With respect to the UNHCR, we consider it too simplistic  to
    state that religious or ethnic minorities are likely to be at increased
    risk in areas in which ISIL  retains  a  presence.   Membership  of  an
    ethnic or religious minority may increase the risk to an individual but
    a contextual evaluation rather than a presumption is required.

301. The position in respect of those contravening strict Islamic  mores  is
    similar, although we note that there  is  comparatively  little  recent
    evidence (whether cited at footnotes 475-478 of the UNHCR guidelines or
    elsewhere) that individuals are presently at risk, or at enhanced risk,
    on this basis.  Some, but not all, of the incidents described in  those
    footnotes pre-date the military defeat of  ISIL  and  we  consider  the
    general direction of travel in Iraq, in light of recent history, to  be
    away from fundamentalism.  Whilst there is  some  evidence  of  attacks
    against  venues  selling  alcohol,  we  note  the   evidence   in   the
    respondent's document entitled Iraq: Standards of Living about the  re-
    opening of such venues in Mosul.  As with the other  factors  presently
    under consideration, we accept that  a  lack  of  adherence  to  strict
    Islamic mores is capable of  giving  rise  to  an  increased  risk  for
    subsidiary protection purposes, although it will be necessary  to  have
    careful regard to the nature of the area in question before  concluding
    that this factor actually serves to increase risk.

302. Journalists who engage in critical  reporting  on  political  or  other
    sensitive issues.  As we have already stated, any decision maker should
    first consider whether such an individual is  deserving  of  protection
    under the Refugee Convention on grounds of actual or imputed  political
    opinion or, conceivably,  membership  of  a  particular  social  group.
    Where they are not, it is possible that such an individual will  be  at
    enhanced  risk  for  the  purposes  of  Article  15(c).   There  is  an
    appreciable overlap between this category and those who are opposed  to
    the GOI or the KRG and those who fail to adhere to Islamic  mores.   As
    the UNHCR document makes clear, however, journalists  and  other  media
    professionals might find themselves at risk or enhanced risk on account
    of criticism of a range of actors,  including  tribal  leaders  or  the
    PMUs.  As with the other categories, a full appreciation of the area in
    question is necessary if such a submission is to  be  assessed  in  its
    proper context.

303. Humanitarian and medical workers were previously targeted by  ISIL,  as
    reported  at  p85  of  the  UNHCR  guidelines.    Such   attacks   have
    significantly decreased since the military defeat  of  ISIL  but  there
    continue to be some reports of intimidation, physical  assault,  arrest
    and detention, and, in  some  cases,  abduction  and  killing  of  such
    individuals.  Those who operate in IDP camps are more  susceptible  and
    it is clear from the guidelines that  the  enhanced  risk  of  violence
    emanates not only from remnants of ISIL in the Formerly Contested Areas
    but also from other  security  actors.   We  are  satisfied  that  such
    individuals might be at enhanced risk under Article 15(c)  in  specific
    areas, although the magnitude of risk will depend upon  the  nature  of
    their role and the hostility of actors in that area to such activity.

304. The appellants'  ninth  and  tenth  categories  are  "Women/girls  with
    certain profiles or in  specified  circumstances"  and  "Children  with
    certain profiles/specific circumstances", both  of  which  descriptions
    are uninformative without further explanation.  As is  clear  from  the
    text of the guidance, UNHCR's concern  is  to  inform  decision  makers
    about the specific types of Refugee Convention risks to which women and
    children might be exposed, including the risks of trafficking,  honour-
    based and domestic violence.  Here, as in other respects, this guidance
    for the application of the Refugee Convention is ill-suited  to  simple
    transposition into the sliding scale analysis required by Article 15(c)
    of the Qualification Directive.  We do consider,  however,  that  women
    and children without  genuine  family  support,  including  widows  and
    divorcees, are likely to be at enhanced risk for the  purposes  of  the
    assessment required by the Qualification Directive.

305. Individuals of diverse sexual  orientations  and/or  gender  identities
    are considered by UNHCR to be likely to be  in  need  of  international
    refugee  protection.   UNHCR   reports,   for   example,   that   LGBTI
    organisations cannot operate openly  and  that  most  individuals  keep
    their orientation or gender identity secret.  Such  considerations  are
    to be assessed firstly under the Refugee Convention framework  provided
    by HJ (Iran) [2010] UKSC 31; [2010] 3 WLR 386 and we do not purport  to
    give country guidance on the situation for LGBTI individuals  in  Iraq.
    Where an individual with a diverse sexual or gender identity  is  found
    not be in need  of  protection  under  the  Refugee  Convention,  their
    identity might nevertheless be relevant to the sliding  scale  analysis
    required by Article 15(c), not least because  UNHCR  records  increased
    difficulties for such individuals in accessing employment  and  medical
    care and in crossing checkpoints.  We note also that EASO states in the
    Targeting of  Individuals  report  that  LGBTI  individuals  have  been
    targeted by the PMUs for "deviating morality".

306. Those targeted as part of tribal conflict resolution  and  blood  feud.
    Pages 106-108 of the UNHCR's guidance provides a  detailed  account  of
    the types of tribal conflict resolution and blood feuds which may occur
    in Iraq.  We think it unlikely that the existence of such a conflict  -
    which  relates  to  a  state  of  affairs  rather  than  an  individual
    characteristic - would be relevant  to  the  sliding  scale  assessment
    under Article 15(c).

307. Palestinian Refugees.  UNHCR explains the risk to those of  Palestinian
    origin in the following way: "Palestinian refugees continue to be faced
    with a sentiment  or  perception  among  some  segments  of  the  Iraqi
    population,  including  among  law  enforcement  agencies,  that   they
    received preferential treatment from the former Government of President
    Saddam Hussein and/or that they are supportive of ISIS, or  previously,
    Al-Qa'eda in Iraq".  The number of Palestinians remaining  in  Iraq  is
    small.  As UNHCR explains in footnote 675 of its guidance, the pre-2003
    population of more than 34,000 has fallen to 8,119 (who are  registered
    with UNHCR).  The vast majority live in  Baghdad,  although  there  are
    smaller population centres in Mosul and the IKR.   UNHCR  continues  to
    record  attacks  against  Palestinians  in  Baghdad  based   on   their
    nationality and perceived  affiliation  with  ISIL.   Palestinians  are
    particularly identifiable because they are not entitled to Iraqi  civil
    status  documentation  and  instead  carry  a  special  card  from  the
    Permanent  Committee  for  Refugee  Affairs  of  the  Ministry  of  the
    Interior.   The  presentation  of  these  cards  can  cause  particular
    difficulty at checkpoints, where  they  are  often  not  recognised  or
    respected, leading to difficulties of  the  types  we  have  considered
    earlier  in  this  decision.   Those  in  Mosul  also  have  particular
    difficulties in securing employment.  It was only in  March  this  year
    that Palestinian  nationals  again  became  eligible  to  receive  food
    through the PDS. The situation for Palestinians in the  IKR  is  better
    than in GOI controlled Iraq, although some difficulties with freedom of
    movement are noted by the UNHCR.


308. The UNHCR does not suggest that Palestinians are likely to be  in  need
    of international protection or  that  they  may  be  in  need  of  such
    protection.  The difficulties faced by this small group are necessarily
    relevant in considering  the  entitlement  of  such  an  individual  to
    subsidiary protection, particularly where  return  to  Mosul  is  under
    contemplation.

309. The appellants' categories (xiv), (xv) and (xvii) draw upon  the  Upper
    Tribunal's assessment in BA (Iraq) CG [2017] UKUT 18 (IAC) and the EASO
    report entitled Targeting of  Individuals.   BA  (Iraq)  was  heard  in
    August 2016 and the decision was issued  in  January  2017,  when  ISIL
    remained in control of a significant proportion of Iraq.   As  we  have
    previously explained, there  have  been  well-established  and  durable
    changes to the situation in Iraq since then.    In respect of  business
    owners and those perceived as wealthy, however, we continue  to  regard
    the guidance given in BA  (Iraq)  as  an  accurate  reflection  of  the
    position in Baghdad.  Whilst there is not a general risk to the wealthy
    in any part of the country, kidnapping remains a problem  in  Iraq  and
    there are reports, already considered above, of the PMU in the Formerly
    Contested Areas being  involved  in  organised  crime  and  corruption.
    Whilst we think it unlikely, on the evidence before us, that a returnee
    would be perceived as wealthy purely on account of having been  in  the
    UK, we do accept that those who are or are perceived to be wealthy  are
    more likely to be at  risk  of  being  specifically  targeted  on  that
    account.  Being wealthy or being  perceived  as  such  is  therefore  a
    relevant  characteristic  for  the  purposes  of  the   sliding   scale
    assessment under Article 15(c) QD.


310. Perceived collaborators of Western  organisations/armed  forces.   This
    group was considered in BA (Iraq) to be likely to be at risk  in  those
    parts of Iraq which were under ISIL  control  or  had  high  levels  of
    insurgent activity.  The risk was  thought  to  be  lower  in  Baghdad,
    although there was evidence at that time to show that groups  including
    ISIL were active and capable  of  carrying  out  attacks  there.   That
    assessment must  be  revisited  because  of  several  durable  changes.
    Firstly, ISIL is no longer in control of swathes of territory in  Iraq.
    Secondly, there is  considerably  less  involvement  of  Western  armed
    forces in what is accepted by the respondent to be  an  internal  armed
    conflict in Iraq.  Thirdly, there is considerably less evidence of ISIL
    and other insurgent groups carrying out attacks in Baghdad.  We do  not
    consider that this group would be at enhanced risk in Baghdad as  there
    is insufficient recent  evidence  to  support  such  a  conclusion.  In
    respect of the risk to  such  individuals  in  the  Formerly  Contested
    Areas, the situation is clearly different  to  that  considered  in  BA
    (Iraq).  As noted at 1.9 of the EASO report on Targeting of Individuals
    "working for the coalition was less sensitive than in  the  past."   In
    areas where ISIL remains active, its primary target is those associated
    with central or local governance or the security apparatus and there is
    little recent evidence to show that those with a current or  historical
    connection to  Western  organisations  or  armed  forces  would  be  at
    enhanced risk on that account alone.  That is not to say that  such  an
    association is  irrelevant  for  the  purposes  of  the  sliding  scale
    analysis;  were  such  an  association  to  become  known  at  a   fake
    checkpoint, for example, then such  an  individual  might  well  be  at
    enhanced risk as compared to a civilian without  such  an  association.
    We accept, therefore that a past or current association  to  a  Western
    organisation or allied forces is a relevant factor in the Article 15(c)
    analysis, albeit one with less significance than before.


311. Our conclusions in respect of people displaying  westernised  behaviour
    reflect the trend we have considered  immediately  above,  although  we
    note reference at section 3.12 of the EASO report to the PMU  enforcing
    'conservative standards on personal appearance'.  There are reports  of
    women being targeted - including in Baghdad - for un-Islamic dress.  We
    note that there is little recent evidence to support a claim  that  men
    displaying Westernised behaviour would  be  at  significantly  enhanced
    risk, even in the Formerly Contested Areas.  In  areas  in  which  ISIL
    retains a presence, however, we consider that such behaviour may  be  a
    relevant characteristic under Article 15(c).

312. The inclusion of category  (xvi)  -  persons  with  disabilities  -  is
    justifiably premised on a section of the EASO report which records that
    there is sadly discrimination, inadequate provision of health care  and
    a higher risk of  violence,  particularly  against  those  with  mental
    illness.

313.  In  summary,  we  consider  that  the  appellants'  proposed  list  of
    seventeen  factors   can   be   somewhat   condensed.    Two   personal
    characteristics are particularly important.   Firstly,  those  with  an
    actual or perceived association with ISIL are likely to be at  enhanced
    risk throughout Iraq.  Secondly, in those areas in which  ISIL  retains
    an active presence, those who have a current personal association  with
    local or national government or the security apparatus are likely to be
    at enhanced risk.

314. Other personal characteristics which are  capable  of  being  relevant,
    individually and cumulatively, to the sliding scale  analysis  required
    by Article 15(c) are as follows:

       i) Opposition to or criticism of the GOI, the KRG or local  security
          actors;
      ii) Membership of a national, ethnic  or  religious  group  which  is
          either in the minority in the area in  question,  or  not  in  de
          facto control of that area;
     iii) LGBTI individuals, those not  conforming  to  Islamic  mores  and
          wealthy or Westernised individuals;
      iv) Humanitarian or medical staff and those associated  with  Western
          organisations or security forces;
       v) Women and children without genuine family support;
      vi) Individuals with disabilities.

315. The impact of any of the  personal  characteristics  immediately  above
    must be carefully assessed against the situation in the area  to  which
    return is contemplated, with particular  reference  to  the  extent  of
    ongoing ISIL activity and the  behaviour  of  the  security  actors  in
    control of that area.

Article 3 ECHR/Article 15(b) QD
316. We have concluded that the situation in the  Formerly  Contested  Areas
    and Baghdad is not such as to engage Article 15(c) in the generality of
    case.  As  a  secondary  submission,  the  appellants  argue  that  the
    situation in those areas engages Article  15(b)  of  the  Qualification
    Directive and that the return of an individual to those  parts  of  the
    country would be in breach of Articles 3 and 8 ECHR.


317. The starting point for  our  consideration  must  be  the  respondent's
    repetition, at [150] of her closing submissions, of her  concession  in
    previous cases that "it remains the position that a person returning to
    Iraq without either family connections able to assist him, or the means
    to obtain a CSID, may be at risk of  enduring  conditions  contrary  to
    Article 3 ECHR".  This section of our decision is therefore principally
    relevant to those who have or are able  to  obtain  a  CSID  (or  INID)
    within a reasonable time or have family  members  from  whom  they  can
    secure assistance or support.


318. We note that it is  UNHCR's  stance  that  individuals  should  not  be
    returned to the formerly contested areas.  In  the  May  2019  position
    paper, the position on forced returns is as follows:

         In light of widespread  destruction  and  damage  to  homes,  basic
         infrastructure  and   agricultural   lands,   limited   access   to
         livelihoods and basic services,  the  contamination  of  homes  and
         lands with [explosive remnants of war], ongoing community tensions,
         including  reprisal  acts  against  civilians   perceived   to   be
         supporting ISIS, as  well  as  localized  insecurity,  UNHCR  urges
         States to refrain from forcibly returning persons originating  from
         areas previously controlled by ISIS or areas with a continued  ISIS
         presence to their areas of origin. UNHCR also advises  against  the
         forcible return of these persons to other parts of Iraq if there is
         a risk that they may not be able to  access  to  and/or  reside  in
         these areas, or that they will otherwise  end  up  in  a  situation
         where they have no choice but to return to their  area  of  origin.
         This guidance pertains to individuals who have been found not to be
         in need of international refugee protection.

319.  For  the  reasons  to  which  we  have  already  referred,  we  attach
    significant weight to this position.  However, it does  not  mandate  a
    conclusion that the return of an individual to the  areas  in  question
    would be in breach of the UK's obligations under the QD or the ECHR, or
    even that  there  would  be  very  significant  obstacles  to  the  re-
    integration  of  an  individual  into  these  areas,  under   paragraph
    276ADE(1)(vi) of the Immigration Rules.  The Tribunal's focus is on the
    rights vouched safe by those provisions, whereas the  UNHCR's  position
    also  reflects  broader  humanitarian   concerns.    The   enquiry   is
    necessarily  fact-specific,  taking   into   account   the   particular
    circumstances of the individual and the area to which it is proposed he
    should return.

320. We note that the written submissions  made  by  the  first  and  second
    appellants place particular  reliance  on  section  C  of  the  UNHCR's
    Protection Considerations in submitting that the situation  in  Baghdad
    and the Formerly Contested Areas is in breach of Article 3 ECHR  and/or
    such as to give rise to very  significant  obstacles  to  a  returnee's
    integration.  That part  of  the  UNHCR's  paper  relates  to  internal
    relocation, however, and not  to  the  question  we  consider  in  this
    section, which is the return of an individual to their home area  in  a
    formerly contested area.  Whilst that guidance, and the  evidence  upon
    which it is based, is necessarily relevant to our consideration of  the
    situation in those  areas,  the  thresholds  in  relation  to  the  two
    enquiries are different, as explained by Burnett LJ in Said and by  the
    Upper Tribunal in AAH (Iraq).  The fact that relocation to a particular
    area might be unduly harsh or an individual could not live a relatively
    normal life in that place does not, without more, mean that  conditions
    in that area breach Article 3 ECHR.  AH (Sudan) [2007] UKHL 49;  [2008]
    1 AC 678 shows that it is an error to assimilate the  consideration  of
    reasonableness with Article 3 ECHR.

321. An individual will only be able to return to his home area and to  live
    there if he has, or is able to obtain within a reasonable time, a  CSID
    or an INID.  If an individual has such a document and  has family  upon
    whom he can rely for meaningful support, we think it generally unlikely
    that he would experience conditions which would be in breach of the  QD
    or the ECHR, or  that  would  engage  paragraph  276ADE(1)(vi)  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  The real question which arises  is  in  respect  of
    those  who  do  have  (or  able  to  acquire)  an  acceptable  form  of
    identification but who do not have support to which they can turn.   In
    referring to support, we endorse what was said in AAH (Iraq), about the
    collectivist nature of Iraqi society  and  the  expectation  that  even
    extended members of the family would be obliged by Iraqi social  custom
    to provide assistance.  We also note, however, that Dr Fatah  was  very
    clear about the limitations of that custom, in stating  that  it  would
    not extend to an individual's tribe  outside  the  family.   Whilst  he
    explained that tribal connections might assist in 'opening doors'  when
    it came to employment, for example,  he  stated  that  such  assistance
    would not extend to providing accommodation or  sustenance  to  a  non-
    relative.  We accept his evidence in that regard.

322. Applying the guidance in the domestic and European authorities we  have
    set out at [213]-[219], we consider that we  are  bound  to  apply  the
    approach in N v UK  when  examining  the  appellants'  submission  that
    return to the Formerly Contested Areas would be in breach of Article  3
    ECHR.  We reach that conclusion for much the same reason as  the  Court
    of Appeal in Said and MA (Somalia).  As in Somalia, it is evidently the
    case that the humanitarian situation in the  Formerly  Contested  Areas
    was previously attributable to the direct and indirect actions  of  the
    parties to the conflict with ISIL.  As we have stated  above,  however,
    that  conflict  has  now  ceased   militarily,   with   ISIL   reducing
    dramatically in size and in the tempo and type of its operations.  With
    the exception of the small area near to Baiji, the  GOI  (supported  by
    the PMU) and the Kurdish authorities are in control of the whole of the
    country.  The government has made  clear  that  its  focus  is  now  on
    rebuilding the country and the elements  of  the  infrastructure  which
    were damaged in  the  conflict.   It  does  not  have  the  funding  to
    undertake that task alone and has appealed for  significant  assistance
    from the international community.  As Dr Fatah explained,  billions  of
    dollars have been pledged but  much  more  is  required.   There  is  a
    substantial presence of international aid agencies in  the  region  and
    they are not, unlike in Sufi & Elmi, significantly hindered  by  actors
    to an ongoing conflict.  It cannot be said, as it was  at  [25]  of  MI
    (Palestine) that the predominant cause of the  humanitarian  conditions
    in the region is an ongoing  conflict.   Whilst  the  conflict  brought
    about the humanitarian situation in the Formerly Contested  Areas,  the
    predominant reason that it continues  is  the  want  of  resources  for
    rebuilding the country. As the Danish Immigration Service put it in its
    November 2018  report  "the  biggest  challenge  for  the  humanitarian
    response is the lack of funding".  Whilst the situation in Iraq, and in
    the formerly contested areas in particular, remains far  from  perfect,
    there is no longer the element of intentionality which was said  in  MI
    (Palestine) to require the application of the less  stringent  approach
    in MSS v Belgium and Sufi & Elmi.


323. Dr Fatah was not asked  in  his  written  reports  to  comment  on  the
    humanitarian situation in Iraq.  He answered a number of questions from
    the advocates, however, and he  accepted  that  the  situation  was  as
    described by the UNHCR at section F of the May 2019 report.  There are,
    as submitted at [55A] of  the  first  and  second  appellants'  written
    submissions,  positive  and  negative  indications  in  the  background
    material.  It is also apparent that there is considerable variation  in
    the situation  on  the  ground  in  different  parts  of  the  formerly
    contested areas.  As we have mentioned above, certain towns and  cities
    were particularly badly affected by the conflict with ISIL.   Dr  Fatah
    doubted in his oral evidence that the cities in Ninewa 'functioned' and
    he emphasised  that  other  places,  such  as  Hawija  and  Sinjar  had
    sustained particularly serious damage, physically and to their  ability
    to provide basic services.  Much depends on the length and severity  of
    the conflict in the  individual  location.   Whilst  Hawija  was  badly
    affected, for example, nearby Kirkuk did not  suffer  extensive  damage
    (although it now suffers from different  problems,  to  which  we  have
    alluded above).

324. In common with Dr Fatah,  the  UNHCR  and  the  advocates,  we  do  not
    consider that we can feasibly consider the situation in  each  town  in
    the formerly contested areas.  We adopt the approach in  section  F  of
    the UNHCR report, therefore, and consider the situation in the formerly
    contested areas and Baghdad as a whole, although we have had regard  to
    all the material cited to  us  by  the  representatives  including,  in
    particular, that material which is extracted at sections F to H of  the
    appellant's lengthy Schedule.  Having done so, we note that it  is  not
    only the UNHCR which cautions against the return of individuals to  the
    formerly contested areas.  That recommendation is echoed, for  example,
    by the International Office for Migration.

325. The reports  by  EASO  and  other  commentators  reflect  the  position
    adopted by the UNHCR.  UNHCR considers that the humanitarian  situation
    has stabilised since the end of major military operations against  ISIL
    but that humanitarian needs remain high.  6.7  million  people  require
    some form of humanitarian assistance and protection, which  equates  to
    18% of the Iraqi population. Most  of  those  are  in  the  areas  most
    affected by the conflict, those being the areas under consideration  in
    these appeals.  Rebuilding efforts have begun but will take 10 years or
    so and require $88 billion.  The process is slow and is  rendered  more
    complex by the presence and actions of the PMUs.  The  lack  of  proper
    identification documents compromises people's access to basic  services
    and places them at  risk of arbitrary arrest.  2.1 million children are
    thought to be at risk of being unable to access basic services due to a
    lack of civil identification documents.  The chronic  housing  shortage
    has been exacerbated by years of conflict and it is estimated that  3.3
    million people live in informal settlements, in Baghdad and  Basrah  in
    particular.  Eight  per  cent  of  IDPs  live   in   critical   shelter
    arrangements, as described in AAH  (Iraq),  whilst  the  rest  live  in
    private arrangements (61%) and IDP camps (31%).   Those  in  camps  and
    critical shelter  arrangements  are  particularly  exposed  to  adverse
    weather conditions.


326. There has been a rapid increase in poverty as a result of  the  decline
    in oil prices and the conflict.   The  poverty  rate  in  the  formerly
    contested areas did not  reduce  at  the  end  of  the  conflict.   The
    conflict also reversed a decline in unemployment, which is particularly
    high among women and young people.  Access to a  livelihood  remains  a
    problem for  IDPs  and  returnees.   Access  to  government  programmes
    including the PDS reportedly remain challenging.  Many IDPs  resort  to
    'negative coping mechanisms' to address their most basic needs and  the
    lack of income has led to secondary displacement.  Water  shortages  in
    and around Basrah have led to problems with agriculture.   Agricultural
    food production capacity  has  reduced  by  40%  as  a  result  of  the
    conflict.  There has been inconsistent provision of  food  through  the
    PDS, particularly in the formerly contested  areas.   Two  million  are
    thought to be in a situation of food insecurity, the majority  of  whom
    live in the formerly contested areas.  The public healthcare system has
    seen a steady decline for  various  reasons  and  the  conflict  caused
    further degradation.  Despite  the  rehabilitation  of  part  of  these
    facilities, capacity has not yet reached pre-war levels.   There  is  a
    shortage of medicines and staff and although the situation is better in
    the  KRI,  its  healthcare  systems  are  stretched  as  a  result   of
    displacement to that area.  Poor hygiene,  damaged  buildings  and  the
    presence of IEDs pose a risk to health in  the  liberated  areas.   The
    lack of health services in those areas is cited as a reason that people
    are reluctant  to  return.   Schools  across  the  country  lack  basic
    facilities,  including  access  to  electricity  and  water.   Children
    without documents are unable to access education.


327.  In  areas  previously  affected  by  conflict,  water  and  sanitation
    infrastructure have been badly affected.  In areas which have  received
    large numbers of IDPs, those facilities are overwhelmed.   There  is  a
    nationwide scarcity of water, which brings with it additional risks  to
    health.  Electricity supplies are unreliable. There had been reports of
    ISIL targeting water and  electricity  supplies.   Unexploded  ordnance
    contamination is widespread.

328. Other difficulties highlighted by the material cited by the  appellants
    orally and in writing, particularly at sections F-H  of  the  Schedule,
    include pressure on IDPs to leave  Baghdad,  ethno-religious  prejudice
    against  displaced  individuals,  the  presence  of  cholera,   ongoing
    dissatisfaction  and  protests  over  perceived  government   inaction;
    restrictions on freedom of movement, corpses remaining in the rubble of
    conflict-affected areas, including Mosul, remaining ISIL activity,  PMU
    abuse of IDPs, forced returns and secondary displacement.


329. In his  oral  evidence,  Dr  Fatah  also  highlighted  the  significant
    variations in food security and  other  problems  faced  by  returnees,
    stating that there were areas such as Ninewa in which towns and  cities
    had been destroyed in order to  get  ISIL  out.   In  other  areas  the
    infrastructure was returning, although he emphasised  the  difficulties
    with funding.  The resumption of oil exports was a  positive  step  but
    IDPs still put a huge pressure on the country, and in particular on the
    IKR.  He accepted that  the  humanitarian  response  had  increased  in
    former conflict areas but said that more  needed  to  be  done.   Basic
    health services had been restored in  some  places  but  the  scale  of
    internal displacement remained significant, with 2.6 million in the IKR
    alone.  More  people  had  been  displaced  in  the  aftermath  of  the
    referendum.  The food situation was supported by humanitarian  agencies
    but the aid did not reach everyone.  People were not dying in the camps
    but it was a different story if the  individual  was  a  single  person
    sleeping rough in a city.  He accepted  the  suggestion  by  REACH  (in
    2017) that the majority of returnees had access to PDS assistance.   He
    accepted that the Iraq Humanitarian Response Plan was one of  the  best
    funded globally but noted that significant funding shortfalls remained.
     He accepted that 42.7% of the population were employed.   Unemployment
    figures amongst IDPS were high.  The humanitarian situation  in  places
    like Hawija was challenging.

330. Mr Thomann echoed the position in the  respondent's  CPIN  of  November
    2018 (Iraq: Security and humanitarian situation) when he submitted that
    the  military  defeat  of  ISIL  had  allowed  greater  penetration  of
    humanitarian assistance into the  formerly  contested  areas,  bringing
    food aid and the restoration of services to those areas.  He noted that
    half of the people who required humanitarian assistance were in Ninewa,
    which is described in a number of reports to be the 'epicentre' of  the
    humanitarian problems.  There had been improvements, even in Mosul, but
    critical gaps remained.  The CPIN of May 2019, entitled Iraq:  Standard
    of Living, highlights improvements to the standards of  living  in  the
    formerly  contested  areas.   It  is  apparent  and  we   accept   that
    humanitarian assistance is reaching areas it previously could not reach
    and that even in areas such as Mosul  and  Hawija,  some  services  are
    being restored, including primary health services.   Overall,  however,
    we accept the position adopted by  the  UNHCR,  that  the  humanitarian
    situation in the formerly contested areas remains very problematic, for
    all the reasons set out above.  In  parts  of  the  formerly  contested
    areas, including Western Mosul in particular,  the  situation  is  very
    challenging indeed.  The photographs of the devastation in that side of
    the city underline what is already very clear from the  reports  before
    us.


331. Nevertheless, we remind ourselves that the threshold is that in N v  UK
    and  we  accept  the  respondent's  submission  that   the   cumulative
    difficulties faced by a healthy, documented  male  returning  to  their
    place of origin in the formerly  contested  areas  do  not  cross  that
    threshold.  Such an individual would be able to access food through the
    PDS or other  humanitarian  assistance  programmes.   They  would  have
    access to the limited employment  options  available.   There  is  some
    primary healthcare available there.  The risks of food  insecurity  and
    water scarcity, together with the risks  from  disease  and  unexploded
    ordnance, even in the worst affected areas and even in respect of those
    who would be required to live in a critical shelter arrangement, do not
    reach the high threshold required for us to conclude that  there  is  a
    general risk of conditions which  breach  Article  3  ECHR,  or  engage
    Article 15(b) QD.  A healthy, documented male returning to a home  area
    in the formerly contested areas, therefore, will not generally be  able
    to  establish  that  theirs  is  a  very  exceptional  case  where  the
    humanitarian grounds against removal  are  sufficiently  compelling  to
    require such protection.

332. It is imperative to recall that the minimum level of severity  required
    by Article 3 is relative and depends on all the  circumstances  of  the
    case, including the duration of the treatment, its physical and  mental
    effects and the  sex,  age  and  state  of  health  of  the  individual
    concerned: Saadi v Italy (2009) 49 EHRR 30.  Although it is clear to us
    that a documented, healthy male would not, on return to a home area  in
    the formerly contested areas, encounter conditions in breach of Article
    3 ECHR, additional vulnerabilities including those considered under the
    'siding scale' of Article 15(c)  might conceivably combine to cross the
    N v UK threshold.  In considering any such submission, decision  makers
    will nevertheless wish to recall that that the combination  of  factors
    in Said, including mental health problems and a lack of family support,
    offset by clan support and remittances from the UK, were  held  by  the
    Court of Appeal to be so short of the N v UK threshold that remittal to
    the Upper Tribunal would serve no purpose: [32]-[33] refers.

Paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) of the Immigration Rules
333. The appellants submitted that an individual who was unable  to  succeed
   on Article 3 ECHR grounds on the basis of the conditions in  their  home
   area might nevertheless  establish  that  there  were  very  significant
   obstacles to their reintegration, thereby bringing themselves within the
   protection of paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) of the Immigration Rules.   We  do
   not discount that possibility.  Again, the  enquiry  will  be  intensely
   fact specific, and will take as its starting point any findings made  in
   relation  to  the  Qualification  Directive  and  Article  3  ECHR:   SA
   (Afghanistan) [2019] EWCA Civ 53.  In Kamara [2016] EWCA Civ 813; [2016]
   4 WLR 152, Sales LJ (with whom Moore Bick LJ agreed) explained that  the
   concept of integration is a broad one and was not confined to  the  mere
   ability to find a job or to sustain life while living in the country  of
   return.  Instead:

         The idea of "integration" calls for a broad evaluative judgment  to
         be made as to whether the individual will be enough of  an  insider
         in terms of understanding how life in the  society  in  that  other
         country is carried on and a capacity to participate in it, so as to
         have a reasonable opportunity to be accepted there, to be  able  to
         operate on a day-to-day basis in  that  society  and  to  build  up
         within a reasonable time a variety of human relationships  to  give
         substance to the individual's private or family life.

334. In S [2017] EWCA Civ 1284; [2018] Imm  AR  169,  the  court  of  appeal
   underlined the need for a broad,  evaluative  judgment  under  paragraph
   276ADE(1)(vi), taking into account certain 'generic' factors such as  an
   individual's  intelligence,  employability  and  general  robustness  of
   character: [58]-[59], per Moylan LJ (with whom Rafferty  and  Irwin  LJJ
   agreed).  In Parveen [2018]  EWCA  Civ  932,  Underhill  LJ  (with  whom
   Gloster  and  Asplin  LJJ  agreed),  disapproved  the  gloss  placed  by
   Treebhawon [2017] UKUT 13 (IAC) on the test.   He  emphasised  that  the
   task of the Secretary of State or the Tribunal  in  any  given  case  is
   simply to  assess  the  obstacles  to  integration  relied  on,  whether
   characterised as hardship or difficulty or anything else, and to  decide
   whether they regard them as "very significant".


335. We do not propose to issue separate guidance in relation  to  paragraph
   276ADE, precisely because the enquiry is so fact-sensitive.  Although we
   have been able to reach the conclusions that we have in relation to  the
   QD and Article 3 ECHR, the obstacles to an individual's integration vary
   infinitely from one case to another and we do not consider that it would
   assist future decision makers to speculate  whether,  in  some  form  of
   case, there would or would not be very significant obstacles to such  an
   individual's re-integration.

                 SECTION F - (CSID and other documentation)

336. Iraq is a bureaucratic country which  has  suffered  from  a  range  of
   security concerns in the 21st century. For both of those reasons, issues
   surrounding the documents needed to return to Iraq  and  to  survive  in
   that country have played a prominent part in the country guidance  cases
   decided to date.  The first such case was MK (Iraq) CG [2012]  UKUT  126
   (IAC), in which the Upper Tribunal listed the three  critical  documents
   at [6]:


         The first is the Civil Status Identity Card (CSID).  The second  is
         the Iraqi Nationality Certificate (Shahdat  al-Jinsiya  al-Iraqiya)
         (INC), the third is the Public Distribution System (PDS) card (food
         ration card).

337. It was common ground in MK (Iraq) that  the  most  important  of  these
    documents is the CSID because "without the CSID card it  is  impossible
    to access any of the other documents listed above, and this has a clear
    impact on ability to move around Iraq, to relocate within Iraq  and  to
    enjoy socio-economic rights, housing and food rations and to access aid
    and  humanitarian  support":  [22].   At  [24],  it  cited  Dr  Fatah's
    statement  that  the  CSID  is  the  physical   manifestation   of   an
    individual's official registration record, which is  a  record  of  the
    individual's birth, held in  manuscript  ledgers  in  the  local  Civil
    Registry.


338. The Tribunal went on to consider how an individual  is  issued  with  a
    CSID in the first place and how, in the case of a returnee who  has  no
    CSID, they might obtain a replacement.  It  decided  that  the  general
    position was that a person who required a  replacement  CSID  would  be
    required to travel to their home area in order to obtain one  but  that
    there were alternative means by which one could be  obtained.   It  was
    thought that Iraqis could obtain a CSID from an Iraqi Embassy  or  that
    one could be obtained within Iraq, either by a family member  or  by  a
    person who had been given power of attorney.  It was also thought  that
    a person could obtain documentation by being presented before  a  judge
    of the Civil Status Court (in Baghdad).


339. MK (Iraq) was decided in April 2012.  HM1 was heard  later  that  year,
    by which stage further information had come to light about the means by
    which an individual might  obtain  a  replacement  CSID.   The  country
    guidance given in MK (Iraq) was generally endorsed.  The Upper Tribunal
    added, however, that the evidence then available established that there
    was a  Central  Archive  maintained  by  the  Iraqi  authorities  which
    retained civil identity records  on  microfiche.   This,  the  Tribunal
    concluded, provided a further way in  which  a  person  could  identify
    themselves and obtain a copy of their  CSID,  whether  from  abroad  or
    within Iraq.

340. Whilst both cases went on appeal to the Court of  Appeal,  the  aspects
    of the guidance which we have set out  above  were  unaffected  by  the
    partial allowing of the appeal in MK  (Iraq):  [2013]  EWCA  Civ  1276;
    [2014] 1 WLR 1329.

341. In AA (Iraq), the Upper Tribunal underlined  again  the  importance  of
    the CSID, holding that it was required to access  financial  assistance
    from the  authorities;  employment;  education;  housing;  and  medical
    treatment and that if a  returnee  showed  that  no  support  would  be
    available in Iraq then they would be likely to  face  a  real  risk  of
    destitution amounting to  serious  harm  if,  by  the  time  any  funds
    provided them by  the  Secretary  of  State  or  her  agents  had  been
    exhausted, it was reasonably likely that they will still have no  CSID.
    This conclusion was based on a concession made by  the  respondent  and
    considered at [151]-[152].

342. The Tribunal considered that an individual could as  a  general  matter
    obtain a replacement CSID from the Civil Status Affairs ("CSA")  office
    for their home governorate, using an Iraqi passport, whether current or
    expired.  Without a passport, the ability to obtain a CSID may  depend,
    the Tribunal concluded, on whether the individual  knew  the  page  and
    volume number of the book holding the  record  of  the  individual  and
    their family.  An individual's ability to satisfy the official that  he
    was the person named on the relevant  page  was  likely  to  depend  on
    whether there were family members or others who could vouch  for  them.
    An individual's ability to obtain a CSID would be likely to be severely
    hampered, however, if they were  unable  to  go  to  the  Civil  Status
    Affairs Office of their home governorate because  it  was  an  area  in
    which Article  15(c)  serious  harm  was  occurring.   Alternative  CSA
    offices for Mosul, Anbar and Salah  al  Din  had  been  established  in
    Baghdad and Kerbala.  Reversing the country guidance in MK  (Iraq),  in
    light of evidence from  Dr  Fatah,  the  Tribunal  concluded  that  the
    Central Archive in Baghdad was not in practice able to provide CSIDs to
    those in need of them.  Whilst there was a  National  Status  Court  in
    Baghdad, the precise operation of the court was unclear.

343. Then came AA  (Iraq),  which  led  to  the  amendment  of  the  country
    guidance in the way  we  have  already  described.   The  Tribunal  was
    criticised for equating the CSID with  a  return  document  such  as  a
    Laissez Passer or a passport.  At [39], the court stated:


         The position with a CSID is different.  It  is  not  merely  to  be
         considered as a document which can be  used  to  achieve  entry  to
         Iraq. Rather, it may be an essential document for life in Iraq.  It
         is for practical  purposes  necessary  for  those  without  private
         resources to access food and basic services. Moreover, it is not  a
         document that can be automatically acquired after return  to  Iraq.
         In addition, it is feasible that  an  individual  could  acquire  a
         passport or a Laissez-passer, without possessing or being  able  to
         obtain a CSID. In such a  case,  an  enquiry  would  be  needed  to
         establish whether the individual would have other means of  support
         in Iraq, in the absence of which they might be at risk of breach of
         Article 3 rights.

344. Then, in June 2018, came AAH (Iraq), which primarily concerned  whether
    Iraqi Kurds could relocate internally to the IKR.  At that time, it was
    agreed that there were no international flights to the  IKR,  which  is
    not the position now.  The  Tribunal  emphasised  the  intensely  fact-
    sensitive nature of the enquiry into whether  an  individual  would  be
    able to obtain a replacement CSID and suggested that the possession  of
    other relevant documents, the location of the Civil Registry Office and
    the availability  of  other  male  family  members  were  all  relevant
    considerations.  In reaching these conclusions, the  Tribunal  recorded
    that the  respondent  had  maintained  the  concession  in  AA  (Iraq),
    regarding the likelihood of an  individual  without  a  CSID  or  other
    support  encountering  conditions  contrary  to  Article  3  ECHR.   It
    endorsed  that  concession,  subject  to  two  caveats  regarding   the
    possession of an INC and the availability of support from  friends  and
    family.  At [98], it concluded that "a person who is unable to  replace
    a missing CSID, and who has no family or others to whom he  could  turn
    for assistance, is likely to face significant difficulties in accessing
    housing, employment, healthcare and other services."   That  concession
    was repeated at [150] of the respondent's  closing  submissions  before
    us, with the respondent accepting that "it remains the position that  a
    person returning to Iraq without  either  family  connections  able  to
    assist him, or the means to obtain a CSID, may be at risk  of  enduring
    conditions contrary to Article 3 ECHR."


345. At [101] and [102],  the  Upper  Tribunal  in  AAH  (Iraq)  set  out  a
    substantial extract from AA (Iraq).  Given the evidence  we  have  been
    asked to consider, it is also necessary for us to set out that part  of
    the decision:

         [178] The evidence before us in this regard is largely undisputed.


         [179] Dr Fatah  in  his  most  recent  report  indicates  that  the
         starting position is that in order to obtain a new  or  replacement
         CSID a person usually had to return to the governorate where his or
         her birth was registered and where the primary family  registration
         book is held i.e. in the local population registration/civil status
         office. He went  on  to  explain  that  there  are  300  population
         registration offices in Iraq which are  responsible  to  a  central
         Civil Status Affairs Directorate.


         [180] Births are registered manually in volumes held at these local
         population registration offices and these offices  are  responsible
         for checking the manual register before issuing a CSID.  They  also
         send information on to the central population registry in  Baghdad.
         USAID  Iraq   told   Dr   Fatah   that   the   central   population
         registry/central archive is not a searchable data base.  Instead  a
         "search of the central archive  needs  an  officer  to  open  doors
         (literally or  metaphorically).  The  search  must  be  done  by  a
         government official - members of the public cannot  search  through
         the "central archive". The key issue is  whether  the  official  is
         willing to do the search - or can be made willing. In addition, the
         individual would need to know his volume and page  numbers  or  the
         official would have to trawl through a given  governorate's  entire
         archive of back-up files. As a consequence, if an  individual  does
         not have his volume and page number his  only  option  will  be  to
         locate a close family member with the same details and hope that an
         official will assist him.


         [181] There is also some doubt as to whether a CSID could be handed
         over to anyone but the individual whose details it contained,  even
         if an individual did hold a power of attorney. In addition, if  the
         person is outside Iraq the details of an  individual's  CSID  would
         have to be sent to him and he would have to ask the  Iraqi  Embassy
         to send any application for a CSID through the Ministry of  Foreign
         Affairs to Iraq. The Ministry of the Interior would  then  need  to
         issue the CSID and send it to the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs  who
         would send it back to the Iraqi Embassy in London.


         [182] UNHCR-Iraq told Dr Fatah that there is  no  database  or  any
         electronic system in place to issue CSIDs. Scanned copies of  local
         paper records are archived in  the  General  Directorate  of  Civil
         Status Affairs in Baghdad.  Having  discussed  the  situation  with
         Landinfo Dr Fatah concluded that registration is undertaken in  the
         local area and that the Civil Status Affairs Directorate or central
         population registry in Baghdad does not generally issue CSIDs.


         [183] This is confirmed to some extent by the fact that  the  Iraqi
         government has set up two Alternative Civil Status Affairs  Offices
         to issue CSIDs to IDPs from governorates which have  been  captured
         by ISIL. One office has been set up in Najaf  to  issue  copies  of
         CSIDs archived from Mosul, and another office has been  set  up  in
         Baghdad to issue copies of CSIDs  to  individuals  from  Anbar  and
         Salahaddin. These offices are only authorised  to  issue  CSIDs  to
         IDPs from these governorates.


         [184] Dr Fatah was further informed by a source  at  the  Norwegian
         Refugee Council that the Ministry of the Interior  had  refused  to
         open up more alternative Civil Status  Affairs  offices  so  as  to
         protect civil records from fraud, to protect confidentiality and to
         avoid duplication, as there was no database or electronic system.


         [185] UNHCR-Iraq provides some support  to  those  without  a  CSID
         through  its  Protection,  Assistance  and  Re-integration  Centres
         ("PARC"), but such support is limited  to  providing  guidance  and
         legal advice on required procedures and documents needed to  obtain
         a CSID. It did not issue these or other documents itself.  It  also
         confirmed that Harikar and Qandil [8] have indicated that  they  do
         not issue CSIDs. The Norwegian Refugee Council told Dr  Fatah  that
         there is a network of legal aid clinics in Iraq, which is funded as
         part of USAID's Iraq Access to Justice Programme. They also provide
         legal advice, but do not issue CSIDs.


         [186] Drawing all of  this  together  we  conclude  that  an  Iraqi
         national should as a general matter be able to obtain a  CSID  from
         the Civil Status Affairs Office for their home  Governorate,  using
         an Iraqi passport (whether current or expired), if they  have  one.
         If they do not have such a passport, their ability to obtain a CSID
         may depend on whether they know the page and volume number  of  the
         book holding their information (and that of their family  members).
         Their ability to persuade the officials that they  are  the  person
         named on the relevant page is likely to depend on whether they have
         family members or other individuals who are prepared to  vouch  for
         them.


         [187] An Iraqi national's ability to obtain a CSID is likely to  be
         severely hampered if they are unable to  go  to  the  Civil  Status
         Affairs Office of their home Governorate because it is in  an  area
         where Article 15(c) serious harm is occurring. As a result  of  the
         violence, alternative CSA Offices for Mosul, Anbar  and  Saluhaddin
         have been established in Baghdad and Kerbala. The evidence does not
         demonstrate that the "Central Archive", which exists in Baghdad, is
         in practice able to provide CSIDs to those in need of  them.  There
         is, however, a National Status Court in Baghdad, to which a  person
         could  apply  for  formal  recognition  of  identity.  The  precise
         operation of this court is, however, unclear".

346. Dr Fatah entered two caveats to the evidence  he  gave  in  AA  (Iraq).
    Firstly, at [104] he is  recorded  as  having  stated  that  the  civil
    registration system was in disarray due to the presence of ISIL between
    2014 and 2017.  He emphasised that there were  many  people  without  a
    CSID but that this problem was considered  'totally  insignificant'  by
    the authorities and that no procedures had been implemented in order to
    assist in the redocumentation of returnees.   Secondly,  the  anecdotal
    evidence on the willingness of officials to  assist  undocumented  IDPs
    was 'not promising': [105].


347. The Tribunal concluded that either a CSID or  a  valid  Iraqi  passport
    would be needed to  leave  Baghdad  airport  by  road:  [111].   It  is
    important to note that this paragraph also  records  the  existence  of
    innumerable checkpoints on the roads from Baghdad to the  IKR  and  the
    expectation by the security forces  that  an  individual  would  be  in
    possession of a CSID.  There was a submission by the respondent in that
    case that 'the Iraqi authorities have assured the Home Office they will
    'assist with any onwards travel documentation'  but  the  Tribunal  had
    'been shown no evidence that this had actually happened, or  what  such
    documentation might be'.  It was Dr  Fatah's  uncontested  evidence  in
    that case that a failure to produce a CSID or, in the environs  of  the
    airport a valid passport, would be likely to result in detention  until
    the authorities could be satisfied of  an  individual's  identity.   An
    internal flight to the KRG was possible but an  individual  would  need
    either a valid passport or a CSID: [112].  In the same  paragraph,  the
    Tribunal accepted Dr Fatah's evidence that an INC could not be used and
    that one  'could  certainly  not  use  a  Laissez-passer,  since  these
    documents are confiscated on arrival'.


348. At [113]-[116], the Tribunal concluded that an individual with  a  CSID
    or a valid passport would usually be able to travel to the IKR by  land
    or air but that the position for an individual without  such  documents
    was entirely different and would require fact-specific assessment.

349. We have set out the development of the country guidance in some  detail
    because  we  are  invited  to  depart  from   it   significantly,   and
    particularly in relation  to  the  documentation  which  an  individual
    returnee might use for onward travel from the location of return (which
    may now be either Baghdad, Erbil or Sulaymaniyah).  With one  exception
    (which relates to the introduction of a new, digital ID card called the
    Iraqi National Identity Document), it is the respondent who invites  us
    to depart from the current country guidance.  The evidential basis upon
    which she invites us to do so is as follows.

350. Firstly, there is a witness statement which was made  by  an  Assistant
    Director in the Home Office Returns Logistic  Unit  named  Diane  Drew.
    This statement was made in a case which is reported as R  (SS)  v  SSHD
    [2019] EWHC 1402 (Admin).  We will return to the judgment of HHJ Coe QC
    in that case in due course.

351. Ms Drew records that an Iraqi delegation  visited  the  UK  between  29
    July 2018 and 2 August 2018.   It consisted of  senior  officials  from
    the National Security Department, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry
    of Foreign Affairs and the Chief of Police at  Baghdad  Airport.   Home
    Office officials discussed  the  CSID  with  the  Iraqi  delegation  at
    length.  The latter felt 'strongly that the information in the  country
    guidance case law was  out  of  date'  and  that  a  CSID  was  'easily
    obtainable'.  Ms Drew also stated that the Chief of Police had told her
    that a person is able to travel from Baghdad to the KRI using a Laissez
    Passer.

352.  Further  communication  between  the  Home  Office   and   the   Iraqi
    authorities  continued  after  the  delegation  had  returned.   On   5
    September 2018, the Iraqi Ambassador to the UK (Dr  Salih  Husain  Ali)
    responded to a letter which had been sent to him on  4  September.   We
    have only been provided with a very poor copy of his letter but  it  is
    in the following terms:


         In reference to your letter dated 4th September, I  would  like  to
         assure you that all the returnees' papers are  checked  on  arrival
         and they are received with courtesy at Bagdad International Airport
         and may be provided with a certification letter.


         The arriving returnees can continue their onward journey  to  their
         final destination in Iraq by domestic flights or road  using  their
         Laissez Passer or letter (if provided)  which  help  them  to  pass
         through our designated checkpoints.  Please note that most of  them
         may be in possession of copies of their national IDs which may  not
         have been disclosed previously.


         The returnees can re document themselves and apply in  their  local
         Civil Status Departments for national  ID  card  on  arrival  using
         copies from his/her old documents or family records with  reference
         to the page and register number holding the  returnees  information
         or that of their family.


         We can confirm that all the Civil Status Records are preserved  and
         held digitally by each  Governorate  Directorate  of  Civil  Status
         Affairs and are accessible to assist in  determining  a  returnee's
         identity with reference to the register and page.


353. The reference to a 'certification letter' led  to  further  discussions
    within the Home Office, following which a further letter  was  received
    from the Iraqi authorities on 2 October 2018.  This letter was from  Dr
    Wael Alrobaaie, the Counsellor of the  Iraqi  Embassy  in  London.   It
    reads as follows:


         In addition to our clarifications outlined in our letter of the 5th
         of September, please note that same procedures are applied  to  all
         the returnees onward travel from Baghdad to  KRG  or  any  city  in
         Iraq.  [T]he certification letter is issued on a case-by-case basis
         and depending on  the  availability,/unavailability  documentations
         (sometimes requested by the returnee),  the  letter  is  issued  by
         Baghdad International  Airport  Police,  and  contains  information
         about the returnee including name, date of birth and  clarification
         that the returnee landed with a Laissez Passer and his repatriation
         procedure is completed at the Airport, this letter is sufficient to
         pass through checkpoints in case of inquiry, please  note  that  in
         rare occasions they may be questioned at checkpoints.  This  letter
         usually not always issued for all the cases, but individually case-
         by-case.  All Civil Status Records have been  preserved  nationally
         and there is a central register back up in  Baghdad  that  includes
         all the civil records of all the provenances [sic] in the event  of
         any form of damages or destruction.  This civil registration backup
         (Microfilm) covers all records from 1957.


         Representatives from the repatriation committee would be  available
         at Baghdad International Airport and ready to  receive  a  returnee
         even at the weekends if we are informed in advance that a  returnee
         is on board of a flight.   The  officers  are  fully  qualified  in
         dealing with the repatriation process and they  can  deal  with  it
         with the last minutes notes.


354. This information led the respondent to update the  Country  Information
    and Policy Note ("CPIN") regarding internal relocation in Iraq.  At [9]-
    [11], Ms Drew relates this information to the facts of SS's  case.   He
    was removed to Iraq on 18 November 2018, holding a Laissez Passer which
    had been obtained from the Iraqi Embassy.  Contact had been  made  with
    the Iraqi Embassy in April 2019, as a  result  of  which  it  had  been
    confirmed by email that SS had not attempted to apply for a CSID  since
    his return to Iraq.  A letter  upon  which  the  claimant  had  relied,
    purportedly  from  the  Directorate  of  Civil  Status  in  Karkh,  was
    confirmed by  the  Iraqi  authorities  not  to  be  genuine.   Ms  Drew
    concluded her statement by confirming  her  belief  that  the  claimant
    could obtain a CSID but had not made any attempt to do  so.   She  also
    confirmed her belief, based on the documents above, that  the  claimant
    would have been able to travel  from  Baghdad  to  the  IKR  using  his
    Laissez passer.

355. This was the material before HHJ Coe QC in R  (SS)  v  SSHD.   In  that
    case, the claimant had arrived as a minor and claimed  asylum.   Asylum
    had been refused but he had been granted Exceptional Leave  to  Remain,
    followed in due course  by  ILR.   He  had  then  committed  a  serious
    criminal offence and  received  a  lengthy  sentence  of  imprisonment,
    following which the Secretary of  State  decided  to  deport  him.   An
    appeal against that decision was ultimately unsuccessful in  2013.   He
    absconded thereafter and, having been prevented from  entering  the  UK
    clandestinely on one occasion, he then succeeded in entering.   He  was
    discovered  and  recalled  to  prison,  from  where  he  made   further
    representations which the respondent refused to treat as a fresh  claim
    for  asylum  under  paragraph  353  of  the  Immigration  Rules.    The
    respondent did  not  accept,  in  particular,  that  he  had  realistic
    prospects of persuading a judge of the FtT(IAC) that his appeal  should
    be allowed on protection  or  human  rights  grounds.   The  respondent
    removed him from the UK after stays on  removal  were  refused  by  the
    Upper Tribunal and the Administrative Court.


356. The claimant in SS (Iraq) submitted that the  Secretary  of  State  had
    been wrong to conclude that he did  not  have  realistic  prospects  of
    success before a putative judge of the  FtT[9]  and  that  his  further
    representations consequently satisfied  the  somewhat  modest  test  in
    paragraph 353 of the Immigration Rules.  In reliance on AA  (Iraq)  and
    AAH (Iraq), he submitted that he did not have a CSID and that he  would
    rapidly find himself in a situation which infringed Article 3 ECHR.  In
    reliance on the material above, however, the respondent submitted  that
    there was no realistic prospect  of  success  before  the  hypothetical
    judge, who would inevitably find that  there  were  strong  grounds  to
    depart from the country guidance decisions.  It was  the  Secretary  of
    State's case, in reliance on the material we have described above, that
    the claimant could attend the CSA office in Baghdad and could find  his
    entry in the civil register, thereby enabling him to obtain a new  CSID
    without needing to attend his local  Civil  Status  Affairs  Office  in
    Mosul.

357. HHJ Coe noted the importance of a CSID in the Iraqi context  and  noted
    that the issue had been 'front and centre' in the CG cases to which she
    had referred: [77].  She considered that it would require fresh,  clear
    and cogent evidence to amount to strong grounds sufficient to supersede
    guidance as recent as AAH (Iraq): [79].  HHJ Coe QC did not accept that
    the letters set out above amounted to clear cogent  evidence  amounting
    to strong grounds to say that a CSID is now easily obtainable  in  Iraq
    by a returnee: [85].  At [86]-[91], she gave extensive reasons for that
    conclusion.  HHJ Coe QC did not consider the evidence about the central
    archive with microfilm records in Baghdad to take matters any  further:
    [86].  It was accepted that the archive did not issue  CSIDs.   It  was
    not said to be searchable, in which case it was  of  little  use  to  a
    person who did not know their page and reference number.  If it was the
    same central archive considered in AAH (Iraq),  the  position  was  the
    same.  If it was not, the Secretary of State had not  explored  how  it
    would enable the claimant  to  obtain  a  new  CSID.   AAH  (Iraq)  had
    explained that  it  was  difficult  to  obtain  a  CSID  without  other
    documentation or the need to 'trace back'  to  the  family  record  and
    family details were seemingly still required: [87].   Dr  Ali  did  not
    refer to the microfilm backup in Baghdad and still referred to  a  need
    to know the page and register number.  Many records had been  destroyed
    and there was no information about the records held in the  alternative
    CSAs or whether they were searchable and, if so, by whom.  It  was  not
    known whether any records existed for the claimant and the Secretary of
    State had not considered the backlog from 2014-2017.  There had been no
    attempt to address what Dr  Fatah  had  said  about  the  attitudes  of
    officials dealing with returnees: [88].


358. There was nothing in the correspondence to indicate  any  certainty  in
    the 'certification letters'.  The correspondence  relied  upon  by  the
    Secretary of State,

         "taken at its face value establishes no more than that there  is  a
         digital  record  in  each  governorate  accessible  to  assist   in
         determining a returnee's identity but it is not clear when this was
         created or if or how it can be  searched  or  if  it  contains  the
         claimant's records. There is a backup central register  in  Baghdad
         on microfilm but it is not clear whether that is  searchable,  what
         records it holds, whether it would include the claimant's  records,
         whether it is the same as the archive referred to in the CG  cases,
         or whether it is  can  be  accessed  by  a  returnee  to  establish
         identity sufficient to acquire a CSID.": [89]


359. So it was that HHJ Coe  QC  concluded  that  the  new  information  was
    relevant but that  it  was  not  sufficiently  clear  and  coherent  to
    supersede the CG: [91].  If the CG  had  been  applied  'unadorned  and
    unamended', the further submissions would undoubtedly have  given  rise
    to a fresh claim:[97]  The refusal to treat the representations as such
    was unlawful  and  it  bore  on  the  decision  to  detain,  which  was
    consequently unlawful.  We understand there  to  have  been  no  appeal
    against Judge Coe's decision, although an appeal against her subsequent
    decision to order the claimant's return to the UK is pending.


360. The  respondent  engaged  in  further  correspondence  with  the  Iraqi
    authorities between the decision in SS (Iraq) and the hearing of  these
    appeals.  A witness statement made by Robert Pickles, also based in the
    Returns Logistics Unit, noted that Amnesty International had  expressed
    doubt about the use of a Laissez Passer or a "certification letter"  in
    order to negotiate checkpoints. In response,  Mr  Pickles  had  sent  a
    letter to the Iraqi Embassy on 22 May 2019  to  seek  clarification  on
    several points.  He had received a response by letter on 23  May  2019,
    in the following terms:

         Certainly  the  certification  letter  at  Baghdad  Airport  allows
         returnees to continue their onward journey and in most  cases  they
         keeps the LP as well with  them  to  use  it  during  their  onward
         journey.  So the letter will be something additional to the  LP  if
         they need it or ask for it.


         Unfortunately we don't have a specific number for the certification
         letters which have been issued before but we can write  to  Baghdad
         and hopefully we will receive the answer soon.


         The certification letter usually issued to those  who  are  without
         CSID and need to travel through checkpoints to their home area  and
         if they have the LP or a copy of any Iraqi ID, this will be  enough
         for them to travel everywhere in Iraq.


         The individuals when they arrive the airport, they  will  ask  them
         whether they have any Iraqi ID or not, and they don't have it, they
         will be provided the certification letter and as we explained, they
         will keep the LP also with them.


         The certification letter and Laissez Passer  recognised  throughout
         the country in all cities including the checkpoints  controlled  by
         the central government and the Iraqi military.


         In all the previous cases, there was no  problem  or  obstacles  at
         Baghdad International Airport to the individuals who  had  returned
         to Iraq already,  and  all  the  process  went  smoothly  and  they
         returned to their families without any issues.


         Most of the individuals have original Iraqi ID or a copy  from  the
         ID and they keep the Laissez Passer as well, and in some cases they
         will obtain the certification letter, all of this documents will be
         enough for  them  to  travel  anywhere  in  Iraq  including  Iraq's
         Kurdistan region.


361. There  was  yet  further  correspondence  with  the  Iraqi  authorities
    thereafter.  This is described in a  witness  statement  from  a  third
    official in the Returns Logistics Team named Declan O'Neill.  There are
    two emails, the first of which is from Ms Drew to Counsellor  Alrobaaie
    dated 13 June 2019,  expressing  concern  that  without  an  answer  to
    certain questions the Home Office might 'lose  the  [country  guidance]
    case, which could have serious consequences on being able to return  to
    Iraq in future'.  Eight detailed questions, composed by  counsel,  were
    put.  The response from the counsellor was exactly as follows:


         I hope this email finding you well,  in  general,  any  person  can
         visit the Civil Status Office in his city and provide them with the
         page number and  reference  number  of  their  records  as  family,
         usually it's the same number for him, brother sister,  and  father.
         So in this case he can get any copy from  his  family  ID  or  only
         submit the family number for the ID, and then can ask them  to  get
         new National ID card or something called  Civil  Status  electronic
         document which includes  all  his  details  with  new  national  ID
         reference or  something  called  Civil  Status  document  for  1957
         includes the page number and reference number of his records.  This
         is just a step to the next step to issue a new National ID.


         The individual does not need any  prior  permission  to  visit  any
         Civil Status Office and he can go in person with his  relatives  or
         without to follow his case with the official Departments.


         If an individual is able to find their Civil Status Records in  the
         central archive, they use this to apply for a new national ID  card
         in his local Civil Status office and while the case is in  process,
         they will give him the Civil Status  document  for  1957  or  Civil
         Status electronic document as I explained above.


         After the stability and the liberation now, the work resumed in all
         Civil Status Affairs Offices and Civil Status Records  offices  for
         Mosul, Anbar and Saluhaddin and the activities now in a normal  way
         in their provinces and the individuals can apply  directly  in  the
         [sic] their offices and they  will  be  dealing  with  the  request
         according to the law, any application will  only  take  the  normal
         time (maybe 1 to 5 working days) according to each request  without
         any delay.


         As we explained before, we can assure you that we  didn't  see  any
         problem or issue for all individual returned on a  Laissez  Passer,
         and all of them returned to their homes  without  any  problem  and
         they didn't submit any request to the MFA or to the return logistic
         team in Baghdad for assistance to issue new documents and this is a
         very clear message that they have no difficulties in the process of
         issuing new Iraqi documents.


         In all the previous cases, there was no  problem  or  obstacles  at
         Baghdad International Airport to the individuals who had retuned to
         Iraq already, and all the process went smoothly and  they  returned
         to their families with out any issues.
          ...

362. Mr  O'Neill  also  stated  in  his  statement  of  20  June  2019  that
    Counsellor Alrobaaie had told Ms Drew on the telephone that he would be
    unable to answer questions about the central archive in Baghdad  as  it
    was run by the Ministry of the Interior and that the  answers  to  such
    questions would take months.


363. In his first report, Dr Fatah stated that Civil Status Affairs  Offices
    in the formerly contested areas had started  working  again,  but  with
    great difficulty, and that obtaining documents from these offices could
    take a long time, particularly if there was some doubt over a  person's
    entitlement: [933]-[937]. A new ID card was replacing the INC  and  the
    CSID.  The CSID was still a very important document but it could not be
    renewed or obtained any more.  The new Iraqi National ID card[10] would
    replace it and the CSID was only valid to the end of 2019: [938]-[941].
     The INID was not compulsory as at March 2019 but  there  were  certain
    circumstances in which it had to be applied for.  An  individual  would
    be told to apply for an INID instead of a CSID at a local Civil  Status
    Affairs Office: [947].  An individual who married or who  had  a  child
    would be required to apply for an INID: [948]-[949].

364. Dr Fatah stated that the INID  process  was  centralised,  whereas  the
    CSID process was regional: [950].  The procedure for obtaining the  new
    card was that the individual would  go  to  their  local  Civil  Status
    Affairs Office and provide their CSID, INC and Residency Card, although
    the document of a close male relative may also be  used  (as  it  would
    enable the entry in the Family Book to be  located).   The  scribe  who
    took the applicant's details would send the  application  form  to  the
    relevant office and present a copy to  the  applicant.   The  applicant
    would be required  to  provide  their  photograph,  an  iris  scan  and
    fingerprints in order to complete the application  process.   It  would
    take two weeks for the INID to become available.  The  application  had
    to be made in person  due  to  the  need  to  provide  iris  scans  and
    fingerprints, although it could then be collected by  a  proxy:  [953]-
    [954]. Dr Fatah provided an image of a redacted card and explained  the
    security features in the document: [955]-[958].

365.  At  [960]-[967],  Dr  Fatah  stated  that  there  were  a  number   of
    difficulties associated with issuing documents.  Civil  Status  Affairs
    Offices had been destroyed and many people had been  displaced  without
    their documents.  The Iraqi authorities were not managing the   problem
    and the lack of good calibre civil servants  was  an  ongoing  problem.
    Restrictions on IDP movement had further compounded  the  difficulties.
    The UNHCR had  recognised  the  severity  of  the  problem,  describing
    undocumented individuals as being in a 'legal limbo', and had  assisted
    some 2,500 Iraqis whose documents had become lost or destroyed.  Courts
    had been set up within camps to provide certificates of births,  deaths
    and marriages and notaries had been sent to camps so that they could be
    granted power of attorney and assist with documentation  problems.   No
    such procedures had been put  in  place  for  returnees  and  Dr  Fatah
    believed that this was because the  Iraqi  authorities  believed  their
    situation to be "trivial".

366. Dr Fatah did not believe that a CSID could be obtained from abroad  any
    more, since it had been replaced by the INID.  At [968]-[980], however,
    he described how a CSID could have been obtained in the  past  from  an
    embassy.  At [981]-[984], he describes the process for applying  for  a
    passport and at [985]-[990], he considers the Laissez Passer.  At [991]-
    [100], he considers whether it would be possible to instruct  a  lawyer
    to assist with obtaining documentation in Iraq,  emphasising that  this
    would not assist in the case of the INID and that the applicant  would,
    in the case of a CSID, still be required to know their page and  ledger
    number.  An individual's family might be  able  to  assist  even  if  a
    lawyer could not, and would not need power of attorney.

367. At [1001]-[1019], Dr Fatah set out  his  response  to  the  suggestions
    that an individual could use  a  Laissez  Passer  or  a  "certification
    letter" in order to get  from  an  airport  to  their  home  area.   He
    emphasised that checkpoints are manned by a variety of armed actors and
    that they are only used  to  seeing  certain  forms  of  documentation.
    Without any or any  familiar  documentation,  an  individual  would  be
    likely to be detained until they could establish their identity, either
    by documentation or by somebody else vouching for  them.   As  for  the
    "certification letter", Dr Fatah had never heard of this  document  but
    it was unlikely, given the way in which checkpoints were  manned,  that
    such a document would offer safe passage to  a  returnee's  home  area.
    The Laissez Passer was a single use document which was retained at  the
    airport of return.  It could not be used for onward travel.  Nor  could
    a passport unless the traveller was international.

368. In advance of the hearing, the Secretary of State  posed  a  number  of
    questions to Dr Fatah about  documentation.   He  maintained  that  the
    letters from the Iraqi Embassy contained political statements and  that
    travel using a Laissez Passer or a certification letter  would  not  be
    possible.  He had explained in  AA  (Iraq)  that  the  Baghdad  Central
    Archive was not publicly available and would not  assist  in  obtaining
    documentation in Baghdad.

369. In answer to questions from Mr Knafler, Dr Fatah  reiterated  his  view
    that a Laissez Passer would not assist a returnee and that it was for a
    single trip.  It would not assist at checkpoints, for  the  reasons  he
    had explained in his report.   If  they  tried  to  present  a  Laissez
    passer, they would be detained until they could prove  who  they  were.
    The militia were in charge of checkpoints,  particularly  those  around
    towns, and were concerned  about  ISIL  and  Kurdish  forces  entering.
    Kurds and Sunnis might be at greater risk at such checkpoints, although
    the reports of Sunnis being targeted in that way had reduced since  the
    defeat of ISIL.  The CSID was generally expected in Iraqi transactions,
    even buying a car.  You might be able to stay in a hotel by  presenting
    a professional ID, such as a teacher's, but the presumption was  always
    the CSID document.  He had never heard of anyone being able  to  obtain
    accommodation, food and employment with a Laissez passer.  Nowadays,  a
    returnee would have to apply for an INID because the lack  of  security
    features on the CSID meant that it was being phased out.  It would take
    two weeks to obtain the INID once an individual had attended the  Civil
    Status Affairs Office in person.  You could not  obtain  this  document
    from London and that had been made clear to him.  You had to go to your
    local Civil Status Affairs Office to get the INID.  There were  flights
    from the UK to Sulaymaniyah on Wednesdays and to Erbil on Thursdays.  A
    person who flew to one of these airports with  only  a  Laissez  Passer
    would not be allowed to leave the airport without a CSID but  he  might
    be allowed to use the telephone in order to contact  people  who  could
    vouch for him.  There was no set procedure.  In the event that a person
    from the Disputed Territories was able to leave one of these  airports,
    they would not be able to cross the Green Line between the IKR and  the
    GOI territory without proper ID; that was very clear to him.   If  they
    were unable to leave the IKR for that reason, they would  not  even  be
    able to move around but if he had links  in  Kirkuk,  he  could  ask  a
    lawyer to assist him in obtaining a CSID.  If he was from Mosul and his
    family was dispersed, he would be in difficulty.   If  a  returnee  had
    been in the UK for fifteen or twenty years, they might have nobody they
    could contact and no record.  If somebody had been  in  the  peshmerga,
    for example, then they might not be able to get a CSID.  Asked  whether
    he was aware of examples of family  books  having  been  destroyed,  Dr
    Fatah said that he did not.  Some places had suffered badly, and Ninewa
    was 'bombed to the ground' but he did not know whether records had been
    destroyed.  It was possible that records could be intact.  He  was  not
    aware  of  ISIL  having   targeted   Civil   Status   Affairs   Offices
    intentionally.


370. In answer to questions from Mr Thomann,  Dr  Fatah  agreed  that  there
    were about 300 Civil Status Affairs Offices and it was significant that
    those in the formerly contested areas had been re-opening.   There  had
    been no registration under ISIL.  Dr Fatah doubted whether the CSID was
    still being issued as the Iraqi government clearly wanted to  implement
    the INID, although he still used his old CSID and  had  been  asked  to
    show it at the airport.  If he wanted to get a new passport,  he  would
    have to get an INID first.  Certainly it was his information  that  you
    would be required to get an INID for such official  interactions.   All
    that was required for the processing of  the  INID  application  was  a
    terminal and he knew that the central authorities had  rolled  out  the
    programme for the INID and expected it to be  completed  in  2019.   Dr
    Fatah was asked about the Baghdad Central Archive.   He  said  that  he
    thought this issue was 'dead'.  He did not  believe  that  the  archive
    issued identity documents and he had made  that  clear  in  AA  (Iraq).
    There was just one person in the office  and  they  would  need  to  be
    'persuaded' to render any assistance.  If you turned up at the  archive
    and gave your name and your place of birth only, how were they supposed
    to assist?  There were so many people and so many entries, dating  from
    1957 and organised according to the place  of  registration.   The  new
    INID required an iris scan and other biodata.  He had seen  the  system
    in operation and it was very simple;  you  provided  all  the  relevant
    information and  returned  for  the  card  in  2  weeks.   He  did  not
    understand why the central archive was relevant.  If you wanted a CSID,
    you attended your local Civil  Status  Affairs  Office.   If  ISIL  had
    destroyed it, maybe the records were backed  up  in  Baghdad.   It  was
    illogical to suggest that a person could get a CSID to tide  them  over
    whilst they waited for an INID because the former took  five  weeks  to
    issue, whereas the latter took two.  He thought it was probably  easier
    to get the new card compared to the old one.


371. Dr Fatah was not aware of people  using  Laissez  Passers  in  the  way
    suggested by the Iraqi authorities.   He  had  never  heard  of  anyone
    getting documents of any  description  using  a  Laissez  Passer.   His
    sister, who is a judge in Sulaymaniyah, had lost her passport  and  had
    been given a Laissez Passer after she  had  shown  all  of  her  copied
    documents to the Embassy.  She had returned to Iraq using this document
    but it had been confiscated on arrival;  she  was  expected  to  get  a
    formal type of ID.  He was sure, with reference  to  the  Iraq  Embassy
    email, that they would try to assist a person who had  only  a  Laissez
    Passer but the question was how they could help.  If a British  citizen
    lost all their documents in Barcelona, and had nothing to link them  to
    the UK, what could the Embassy do?   If  an  individual  had  no  Iraqi
    documents and no family, the Iraqi authorities  could  not  help  them.
    Family or other connections might be of assistance.  The statement made
    by the Chief of Police at  Baghdad  International  Airport  was  merely
    political.  He might control some of the checkpoints  but  not  all  of
    them.  In the UK, the Home Office was able to publish policy  to  which
    its staff would adhere.  In  Iraq,  however,  this  was  not  the  case
    because there were many actors and there was no homogenous approach. He
    disagreed with the suggestion that a  Laissez  Passer  was  a  document
    which would help an individual to pass through designated  checkpoints.
    He had never heard of a certification letter and asked Mr Thomann  what
    it was.  His sister had returned to Iraq using a Laissez Passer and she
    had been able to show a professional ID document in place  of  a  CSID.
    He had seen the Laissez Passer for himself, as he was with her when she
    checked in, and it said clearly that it was valid for  one  trip  only.
    He was simply not aware of the people described  by  the  Embassy,  who
    were said to have returned using LPs and experienced no difficulties.


372. In answer to our own questions, Dr Fatah stated that he knew about  the
    process for applying for an INID  from  three  sources.   He  knew  two
    people who had obtained such documents and he knew a solicitor in  Iraq
    who helped people to obtain them.  She would help people  complete  the
    formalities.  He had never heard of anyone other than  his  own  sister
    who had been returned to Iraq using a  Laissez  passer.   He  confirmed
    that he was not aware of  ISIL  specifically  targeting  Civils  Status
    Affairs Offices.  The queue for the reopened offices in places such  as
    Mosul was very long and these were people who already had their own  ID
    cards.  He had attended a conference three of four years ago  at  which
    the question of documentation for IDPs was discussed.  The  judges  who
    had been  in  attendance  did  not  know  what  to  do  to  help  these
    unregistered people who  had  been  born  in  camps  and  thought  that
    legislation would be necessary.

Submissions
373. The comparatively brief submissions made  by  the  appellants  and  the
    respondent on this subject can be found above.

Analysis
374. The most significant respect in which we are asked to depart  from  the
    extant  country  guidance  concerns  the   Laissez   Passer   and   the
    "certification  letter".   The  respondent's  contact  with  the  Iraqi
    delegation and the communications  with  the  Iraqi  authorities  which
    followed caused the respondent to conclude  that  an  individual  could
    travel internally using one or both  of  these  documents.   With  very
    little hesitation indeed, we do not consider the  evidence  adduced  by
    the respondent to be sufficiently cogent to cause us to depart  from  a
    clear and consistent line of country guidance authority.  We reach that
    conclusion for the following reasons.


375. The Laissez Passer has been a feature of  the  Iraq  CG  landscape  for
    years.  In AA (Iraq), the Tribunal considered the feasibility of return
    in some detail, which in turn necessitated consideration of the ways in
    which an individual might obtain a passport or a  Laissez  Passer.   At
    that stage, Dr Fatah explained that an individual who wished to  obtain
    a Laissez Passer was required to produce "either a CSID  or  INC  or  a
    photocopy of a previous Iraqi passport and a police report noting  that
    it had been lost or stolen is required in order to  obtain  a  Laissez-
    passer".  Further enquires made by Dr Fatah with the Iraqi Consulate in
    London suggest that this is no longer the case, and that an  individual
    must simply be able to establish their nationality in order to obtain a
    Laissez Passer.  In the absence of documentation, an Iraqi national can
    request family members in Iraq to present documents to the Ministry  of
    Foreign Affairs to prove the individual's nationality or, failing that,
    "legal procedures will then be started to prove the  Iraqi  nationality
    of the failed asylum seeker through a list of questions in relation  to
    their life in Iraq".  These details are checked against Iraqi  records,
    and once verified  the  individual  will  be  issued  with  a  document
    enabling the individual to return to Iraq.  Dr Fatah goes on  to  state
    in his report that the website of the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs
    states that the resulting document is valid for six months and that  it
    'permits a single entry into Iraq'.


376. Dr Fatah had not heard of a person being returned to Iraq on a  Laissez
    Passer and being able to use that document for onward travel.   He  had
    personal experience of his sister using such a document  to  return  to
    Iraq because she had lost her passport.  He said that the document  was
    taken from her at the airport in  the  IKR.   It  is  notable,  in  our
    judgment, that there is no evidence to show that  returnees  have  been
    able to travel to their home areas using a  Laissez  Passer.   That  is
    despite the fact that returns to  Iraq  continue  to  take  place  from
    around the world and that the situation in Iraq is the subject of close
    scrutiny on the part  of  various  respected  organisations.   We  have
    reports from a wide range of NGOs and other bodies before us  and  they
    speak with  one  voice  about  the  importance  of  the  CSID  and  the
    difficulties faced by those that do not have such documents.  If  those
    difficulties were not faced by returnees  with  a  Laissez  Passer,  we
    would have expected that to have been said rather  earlier  than  2018.
    The reason that there is no evidence which serves to confirm the  claim
    made by the Iraqi authorities is as confirmed by Dr Fatah and  as  held
    in AAH (Iraq): they are confiscated upon arrival.  That is the position
    stated at 5.23 of the Australian  Department  of  Foreign  Affairs  and
    Trade October 2018 report on Iraq and we consider it to be correct.

377. The certification letter is a more recent concept.  We note that  there
    was some reference to such a document  in  AAH  (Iraq),  in  which  the
    respondent recorded  that  the  Iraqi  authorities  had  undertaken  to
    "assist with any onwards travel  documentation"  but  matters  had  not
    progressed any further at that stage.  Dr Fatah had never heard of such
    a document.  The respondent was not able  to  produce  one  before  the
    Tribunal.  Frankly, we doubt that any such document exists and  we  are
    strongly attracted to Dr Fatah's suggestion that the statements made by
    the Iraqi authorities in this respect, unsupported as they are  by  any
    further evidence, are merely political.

378. Let us assume for present purposes, however,  that  an  individual  who
    arrives at Baghdad International Airport or an airport in the IKR  with
    a Laissez Passer and nothing else is allowed to  continue  his  journey
    with the blessing of the airport  police  and  a  certification  letter
    issued by them.  We consider whether an individual equipped with  those
    two documents would be able to make his way to his home  area.  Amnesty
    International, which retains a presence in the region, wrote to Mr Cole
    on 14 May 2019.  It  stated,  inter  alia,  that  it  had  not  seen  a
    certification letter or  documented  their  use.   It  expressed  'some
    scepticism regarding the use of such a  certificate,  combined  with  a
    Laissez Passer in order to pass through checkpoints.'   We  share  that
    scepticism, for the same reasons as those given  by  Dr  Fatah  and  by
    Amnesty International.  It is very clear,  not  only  from  Dr  Fatah's
    reports but from every other item of source material to which  we  have
    been referred, that security checkpoints and particularly those outside
    Baghdad are manned by a variety  of  armed  actors.   In  the  Formerly
    Contested Areas in particular, an individual is very likely  indeed  to
    encounter checkpoints which are manned by Iranian backed Shia  militia.
    In the IKR, they will certainly encounter checkpoints which are  manned
    by the Peshmerga.   These  are  not  individuals  who  fall  under  the
    supervision of the Chief of Police in Baghdad and we  think  it  highly
    unlikely such a document would be sufficient  to  satisfy  them  of  an
    individual's identity.  In light of the other evidence  which  we  have
    about the behaviour of the PMU, we accept what was  said  by  Dr  Fatah
    about their likely attitude  to  alternative  forms  of  identity.   He
    reminded us that  they  are  often  religious  zealots  with  the  most
    rudimentary training.  If, as is very likely to be the case, they  have
    been trained to ask people for a CSID or an INID, there is every reason
    for them to insist upon seeing such a document.  All  of  the  evidence
    shows that those who do not have  one  of  these  recognised  forms  of
    identification are likely to encounter difficulty at checkpoints.   The
    letter from the Iraqi Embassy to Ms Drew fails to deal with that point,
    despite  having  been  asked  specifically  to  consider  whether  'the
    certificate and/or Laissez Passer would not be accepted by the  Popular
    Mobilisation Units'.

379. In his closing  submissions,  Mr  Thomann  suggested  that  Dr  Fatah's
    evidence  showed  that  alternative  forms  of  ID  document  might  be
    accepted.  He cited the example of Dr  Fatah's  sister  being  able  to
    travel from the airport  using  her  judicial  identity  document.   Dr
    Fatah's evidence was not only that she had her judicial  ID  card.   He
    stated in terms that she had shown copies of her misplaced documents to
    the Iraqi Consulate in London.  We consider there to be  a  significant
    difference between a judge returning to  their  local  airport  with  a
    Laissez passer, a judicial ID card and copies of  her  CSID  and  other
    documents and  a  failed  asylum  seeker  seeking  to  travel  from  an
    international airport to another part of the country holding a  Laissez
    Passer and a certification letter, even if  the  latter  document  does
    exist.


380. We consider the position in relation to passports to be equally  clear,
    and we accept the evidence given by Dr Fatah that this is perceived  as
    a document for international use, rather than for  domestic  travel  or
    accessing domestic services.   We  recognise  that  this  represents  a
    slight departure from the extant country  guidance,  in  which  it  was
    accepted that a passport could be used for  internal  travel.   In  our
    judgment, however, the clear expectation is that an individual  who  is
    travelling internally by land must produce either a CSID or an INID  at
    a checkpoint.  We are supported in that conclusion by the EASO document
    entitled  Targeting  of  Individuals,  which  refers  to   difficulties
    encountered by Palestinians in Iraq on account of the  fact  that  they
    are not eligible for the CSID.  They are instead issued with  a  formal
    document by the Ministry of the Interior  but  even  that  document  is
    often not recognised at checkpoints, according to EASO.  As  stated  by
    Dr Fatah and Amnesty International, an  individual  who  is  unable  to
    produce a recognised Civil Status document is reasonably likely  to  be
    detained until they can produce a CSID or an INID or their identity can
    be confirmed by a family member.  The position is  obviously  different
    in respect of internal travel by air, which is controlled by the formal
    authorities of the country rather  than  a  range  of  different  armed
    actors.  In the case of internal air travel, either an  Iraqi  passport
    or a CSID will suffice.  Because a Laissez Passer would be  confiscated
    upon arrival, we do not consider that it would be of any assistance  in
    facilitating onward travel by air.


381. We note that the statement from the Iraqi embassy  states  that  former
    returnees had been able to return to their families  'without  issues'.
    At [166] of her written  submissions,  the  respondent  invited  us  to
    attach significance to this statement.  We decline to do so.   We  have
    no information about the circumstances  of  these  individuals  and  it
    would  be  wholly  improper  to  conclude,  for  example,   that   they
    experienced 'no issues' in respect of internal travel because they were
    able to use a Laissez Passer  or  a  Certification  letter  for  onward
    travel.  Many of those who were returned might have had a  pre-existing
    CSID or access to it, even if they had not made that fact known to  the
    country in which they had sought protection.  Many of them  might  have
    had family members who could have assisted them in Baghdad and arranged
    for the issuance of a CSID by proxy.  We simply do not know,  and  even
    if this vague statement about other returnees is correct, it  does  not
    assist the respondent without further  information  about  the  way  in
    which those individuals were able to return to their  families  without
    difficulty.


382. The second respect in which the respondent asks us to depart  from  the
    current country guidance in relation to documentation is in relation to
    the ease with which a replacement CSID may be obtained.

383. We have not been asked to revisit the extant country  guidance  on  the
    way in which an individual might obtain a replacement CSID from  within
    the UK, for which see [173]-[177] of AA (Iraq) and [26] of AAH  (Iraq).
    We add only this: whilst the INID is  clearly  replacing  the  CSID  in
    Iraq, consulates do not have  the  electronic  terminals  necessary  to
    issue the INID and continue to issue the CSID instead, as confirmed  in
    a Canadian Immigration and Refugee Board  report  which  is  quoted  at
    5.6.9 of the respondent's  CPIN  entitled  Internal  Relocation,  civil
    documentation and returns, dated February 2019.  An Iraqi  national  in
    the UK would be able to apply for a CSID in the  way  explained  in  AA
    (Iraq) and, if one was successfully obtained, we find that it would  be
    acceptable evidence  of  the  individual's  identity  throughout  Iraq.
    Notwithstanding the plan to replace the old CSID system with  the  INID
    by the end of 2019, we accept what was said by EASO (in February  2019)
    and the Danish Immigration Service and  Landinfo  (in  November  2018),
    that implementation was delayed and that the CSID was still being  used
    in Iraq, and that it continues to be  issued  in  those  parts  of  the
    country in which the INID terminals have not been  rolled  out.   Given
    this evidence, and the fact that the CSID has been a feature  of  Iraqi
    society for so long, we do not accept that there will come  a  time  at
    the end of this year when the CSID suddenly ceases to be acceptable  as
    proof of identity.

384. What of the position of those who will return to Iraq  without  a  CSID
    or INID?  We have  already  explained  why  we  do  not  consider  that
    individual would be able to travel internally without these  documents,
    and why a Laissez Passer or Certification Letter  would  certainly  not
    assist.  The respondent's submission is that such an  individual  could
    obtain a replacement document in Baghdad, and that they will  not  have
    to attempt the journey from the capital  to  their  home  area  without
    acceptable  evidence  of  identity.   With  reference  to  the  further
    evidence we have set out above, she submits  that  such  an  individual
    could secure assistance from the Baghdad  Central  Archive  and/or  the
    replacement CSA offices which were set up between 2014 and 2017.

385. There are a number of relevant considerations.   Potentially  the  most
    important is the location in which a person is able to apply for a  new
    or replacement CSID or INID.  The clear expectation - and  this  strand
    runs consistently through the country guidance decisions - is  that  an
    individual should apply for a new or replacement document in the  place
    where their family is registered, that being the location of the Family
    Book ledgers in which the family record is  made  and  retained.   That
    expectation remains clear in the more recent evidence  before  us.   Dr
    Fatah refers in his first report to an individual going to  'the  local
    office' in order to obtain a replacement.  The DIS and Landinfo  report
    which is quoted by EASO refers to an individual applying (for an  INID)
    in their place of origin.  One of the sources quoted by the DIS  stated
    that if an individual 'lost their documents, they must  travel  to  the
    area of origin to have them re-issued'.  We note that the  respondent's
    evidence serves generally to reinforce that expectation.  Dr Ali refers
    in his letter to  a  person  attending  their  'local  office'  and  Dr
    Alroobaaie states that an individual should  attend  the  Civil  Status
    Office in their "home city" in his letter and in his email of  17  June
    2019.  That expectation is underpinned by the way in which records  are
    generally kept and accessed in Iraq.  As explained in previous  country
    guidance decisions, this process has for decades taken place at a  very
    localised level, at one of the  hundreds  of  CSA  offices  around  the
    country.

386. There is no evidence before us which satisfactorily establishes that  a
    returnee who is not from Baghdad would be able to apply for a  CSID  or
    an INID in that city.  Dr Fatah's oral evidence  was  that  only  those
    from Baghdad would be able to apply for  replacement  documents  there.
    The Danish Immigration Service report  of  November  2018  records  the
    Kafkaesque consequence of the requirement to apply  for  a  replacement
    document in one's own area in the following paragraph:

         In order for the IDPs to return, they must have  ID-documents  that
         are issued in the areas of origin. If  they  have  lost  their  ID-
         documentation, they must travel back to the area of origin to  have
         them re-issued. However, without documents it is very difficult  to
         travel anywhere and pass the checkpoints,  because  people  without
         documents more often face arbitrary arrests and detentions.

387. The evidence  from  the  Iraqi  authorities  does  not  establish  that
    identity documents can be issued from the  Central  Archive,  which  is
    simply a repository for copies of records on microfiche.  That evidence
    does not  satisfactorily  address  the  concerns  expressed  about  the
    Central Archive in the previous  country  guidance  decisions,  or  the
    concerns expressed by HHJ Coe QC in R (SS) v SSHD. Nor do  we  consider
    it to be established  that  the  alternative  CSA  offices  which  were
    established during the ISIL occupation of certain parts of the  country
    would provide any, or any prompt, assistance to a returnee from abroad.
     It remains the case that the operation of these  centres  is  unclear.
    The EASO report on  Internal  Mobility  reports  that  the  process  of
    applying for reissuance is "complex, non-standardised and fraught  with
    allegations of corruption."  Also at  section  2.4.4  of  that  report,
    however, it records that  the  re-documentation  centres  had  assisted
    thousands of IDPs and vulnerable Iraqis  to  receive  legal  documents.
    There is no adequate evidence to show that this assistance is available
    to those who  have  been  returned  from  abroad,  and  the  assistance
    provided by the Ministry of Migration and  Displacement  alongside  the
    UNHCR appears, instead, to be provided  to  those  who  are  internally
    displaced within Iraq.  Our view in that  respect  is  confirmed  by  a
    UNHCR  report  from  May  2016  which  is  quoted  at  6.1.10  of   the
    respondent's  Internal  Relocation  CPIN,  which   records   that   the
    'administrative procedures  involved  to  recover  lost  identification
    documents is reportedly filled with obstacles', before providing a list
    which shows the relevant CSA office for individuals, depending on  'IDP
    Place of Origin'.  Despite the respondent's request  for  clarification
    from the Iraqi authorities, there is certainly no  data  before  us  to
    show that returnees  from  abroad  have  benefited  from  the  services
    provided at these centres. We accept what was said by Dr Fatah in  this
    regard, that the difficulties of an  individual  returnee  from  abroad
    would likely be seen as a trivial matter by these offices and that they
    would  be  unlikely  to  receive  any  assistance  in  redocumentation.
    Certainly, given the well-documented problems experienced  by  IDPs  in
    this regard, it is highly unlikely that an individual returnee  without
    a CSID or an INID would receive prompt assistance from  such  a  place,
    even assuming that they would assist a returnee, rather than an IDP.


388. Given that a returnee without a CSID or an INID  could  not  apply  for
    one in Baghdad, the next question is whether they might obtain  such  a
    document by the use of a proxy, whilst they  remain  in  Baghdad.   The
    question must be framed in that way because we have  already  concluded
    that the individual would be unable to travel onwards without  adequate
    documentation.  In respect of the  INID,  the  position  is  absolutely
    clear.  Because the application for that card requires the enrolment of
    biodata including fingerprints and iris scans, it must be  applied  for
    in person.  That was Dr Fatah's evidence and was also reflected in  the
    EASO and DIS/Landinfo reports.

389. In respect of the CSID, the position remains as it was before,  subject
    to the introduction of the INID and the gradual phasing out of the  old
    forms of identification.  We are satisfied that the CSID is still being
    issued in parts of Iraq.  That is clear from the section 2.4.4  of  the
    EASO report.  We consider it to be clear from that report, and from  Dr
    Fatah's evidence about the practice in the IKR, that an individual  who
    is registered in a city in which the INID process has been  rolled  out
    would be unlikely to secure a replacement CSID there.  The logic  which
    underpins Dr  Fatah's  evidence  is  irrefutable,  and  was  implicitly
    accepted by the respondent at [151] of her closing  submissions,  which
    spoke only of the CSID still being issued 'in rural areas'.  The  Iraqi
    government wishes to have a more secure identity system and  has  spent
    large sums to implement that new system.  The implementation is  behind
    schedule.  In the event that CSID documents  were  issued  by  the  CSA
    offices in which the INID terminals have  already  been  located,  that
    would further delay the implementation of the new system.  In the event
    that an  individual  CSA  office  has  no  terminal,  the  position  is
    obviously different and it is individuals who are registered  at  those
    offices who might be able to secure a CSID by the use of a  proxy.   We
    have no list of the CSA offices which  do  and  do  not  have  an  INID
    terminal, however, and any such list would be quickly outdated  as  the
    INID programme continues to expand.  It will  consequently  be  for  an
    individual appellant who does not have an CSID or an INID to  establish
    on the lower standard that they cannot obtain a CSID by the  use  of  a
    proxy, whether from the UK or on arrival in Baghdad.

390. The process for obtaining a replacement CSID by the use of a proxy  (or
    a power of attorney) has been considered in previous cases and there is
    no reason to depart  from  the  guidance  given  in  those  cases.   As
    explained at [25] of AAH (Iraq), a number of documents  are  ordinarily
    required and, if those documents are available, and  a  suitable  proxy
    can present them to the relevant CSA office, a CSID  should  be  issued
    within three days: [27].  In the event that some of the  documents  are
    missing, it might nevertheless be possible to obtain a replacement CSID
    and the key piece of information which  is  required  is  the  family's
    volume and page reference in the civil register: [28].   A  great  deal
    of effort has been expended, both in the preparation of these cases and
    in  previous  country  guidance  decisions,  on  considering  how  this
    information might be obtained if it is not known to the individual.  We
    do not consider the evidence collated by the respondent in defence of R
    (SS) v SSHD or in these appeals  to  take  matters  any  further.   The
    evidence does not establish that the Central Archive is  accessible  to
    individuals, or that its microfiche records are searchable.  Given  the
    number of records it contains, we think it  highly  unlikely  that  the
    Central Archive would be of any assistance to an individual  who  finds
    themselves in such a position.


391. We consider the number of individuals who do not  know  and  could  not
    ascertain their  volume  and  page  reference  would  be  quite  small,
    however.   It  is  impossible  to  overstate  the  importance   of   an
    individual's volume and page reference in the  civil  register.   These
    details appear on  numerous  official  documents,  including  an  Iraqi
    passport, wedding certificate and birth certificate,  as  well  as  the
    CSID.    It was suggested in a  report  from  the  British  Embassy  in
    Baghdad, quoted at 6.1.9 of the Internal Relocation  CPIN  of  February
    2019, that "[a]ll Iraqi nationals will know or be able to easily obtain
    this information".  We find the former assertion entirely unsurprising.
     The volume and page reference in the civil  register  is  a  piece  of
    information which is of significance to the individual and their family
    from the moment of their birth.  It is entered on various documents and
    is ever present in that person's life.  We do not  lose  sight  of  the
    fact that there remain a significant number of people in Iraq  who  are
    undocumented.  We do not consider that problem to be attributable to  a
    difficulty with recalling the  relevant  information.   It  is  instead
    attributable to the closure - until comparatively  recently  -  of  the
    local CSA offices at which people were required to  obtain  replacement
    documents and to their reluctance to return to those areas from a place
    of relocation.


392. There will of course be those who  can  plausibly  claim  not  to  know
    these details.  Those who left Iraq at a particularly young age,  those
    who are mentally unwell and those who  have  issues  with  literacy  or
    numeracy may all be able to make such a claim plausibly but we consider
    that it will be very much the exception that  an  individual  would  be
    unaware of a matter so fundamental to their own identity  and  that  of
    their family.  The letter from the Embassy  also  suggested  that  most
    Iraqis would be able to obtain this information  easily.   Again,  that
    assertion is unsurprising when viewed in its  proper  context.   As  is
    clear from AAH(Iraq), Iraq is  a  collectivist  society  in  which  the
    family is all important.  It is also a country with a  high  prevalence
    of mobile telephone usage amongst the adult population.  Even  when  we
    bear in mind the years of conflict and displacement in Iraq,  we  would
    expect there to be only a small number of cases in which an  individual
    could plausibly claim to have no means of contacting  a  family  member
    from whom the relevant volume and page reference could be  obtained  or
    traced back.

393. If an individual genuinely has no relevant documents to present, via  a
    proxy, to the relevant CSA office, if they genuinely do  not  know  the
    volume and page reference in the civil register, and if they  genuinely
    cannot contact a family  member  from  whom  those  details  cannot  be
    obtained, there will be no realistic prospect of that person  obtaining
    a CSID remotely upon return to Baghdad.  The respondent's evidence does
    not establish to  our  satisfaction  that  the  Central  Archive  would
    present an alternative way of accessing the relevant  information;  the
    alternative CSA offices in Baghdad are not established to  be  for  the
    use of returnees from abroad; and officials in the local civil registry
    would be unwilling to trawl through the entire record for the  area  in
    order to retrieve that  information.   Set  in  context,  we  think  Dr
    Fatah's evidence  that  an  individual  returnee  would  be  considered
    trivial and might be met with sarcasm to be more likely than the rather
    different picture presented by the Iraqi authorities. And  we  consider
    the evidence of the Iraqi authorities, as currently presented, to  fall
    very short of establishing that there  is  a  realistic  route  for  an
    otherwise undocumented individual in Baghdad,  who  is  not  from  that
    city, to acquire a CSID or INID there.  As HHJ Coe concluded in R  (SS)
    v SSHD, the earlier evidence leaves many questions unanswered, and  the
    later evidence fails to provide those answers.  It is still  not  clear
    whether there is, in addition to the  Central  Archive,  an  additional
    database.  It is still not clear whether that  database  is  searchable
    and, if so, by whom.  Nor have the Iraqi  authorities  stated  whether,
    contrary to our conclusion above, the  alternative  CSA  offices  which
    undoubtedly exist in Baghdad (and elsewhere) might accept  and  process
    an application for a CSID or an INID from an  individual  returnee,  as
    opposed to an IDP.  If, as suggested in Dr Alrobaaie's final email,  an
    individual returnee might apply to the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs  or
    the Returns Logistics Team for assistance in  securing  an  alternative
    document, there must be greater clarity in the way  in  which  such  an
    application may be made by an otherwise  undocumented  individual,  the
    way in which their identity might be satisfactorily concerned, and  the
    likely timescale for the processing of such an  application.   We  note
    that a number of relevant questions were posed by the respondent to the
    Iraqi authorities and that they were referred to the  Ministry  of  the
    Interior for answers which are still awaited.

394.  There  is  a  further  potential  limitation  on  the  ability  of  an
    individual to obtain a CSID remotely,  whether  from  the  UK  or  upon
    return to Iraq, in that some of the civil registries  and  the  records
    they contained might have been damaged during the conflict  with  ISIL.
    The respondent submitted at [163] of her closing submissions  that  all
    of the CSA offices had re-opened and that there was no evidence of  any
    records having been destroyed.  The evidence before us does not suggest
    that any of the offices were destroyed, or that any remain  closed,  or
    that any records were destroyed during the conflict.  Given  the  scale
    of the devastation in some parts of Iraq,  however,  we  recognise  the
    possibility that some offices or records might have been destroyed

395. In  the  event  that  an  individual's  'local'  CSA  office  has  been
    destroyed, the likelihood of their obtaining a CSID remotely is slim at
    best.  Despite the statements made by the Iraqi  authorities  in  their
    communications with Ms Drew and her department, we do not consider that
    such an individual would be able to secure  any  prompt  or  meaningful
    assistance in Baghdad, whether it be to locate their  volume  and  page
    reference or to secure the issuance of a CSID.  Of course,  the  burden
    is on an individual who asserts that they are in  such  a  position  to
    establish on the lower standard that to be the case.  In  the  case  of
    individuals  registered  in   areas   which   experienced   significant
    infrastructure damage, it will be easier to establish by inference that
    the relevant CSA office was destroyed.  In the case of areas  in  which
    less damage occurred, decision makers might legitimately expect to  see
    more specific evidence.

396. There is one final matter which we must mention in connection with  the
    possibility of obtaining replacement  documents  in  one  of  the  ways
    considered above.  It is a recurring theme in the background  material,
    particularly in the valuable guidance provided by the UNHCR, that those
    who have or are suspected to have ties to  ISIL  are  routinely  denied
    documents on account of that fact or suspicion.  Even where it  appears
    to a decision maker that an  individual  might  be  able  to  obtain  a
    replacement CSID whilst in the  UK  or  (via  a  proxy)  on  return  to
    Baghdad, it will be necessary to consider whether such a document might
    be denied on account of such an actual or perceived association.


                       SECTION G - INTERNAL RELOCATION


397. Since the conclusions we have reached in  relation  to  the  background
   situation  and  documentation  necessarily  feed   into   the   internal
   relocation analysis, we have taken this issue last.


398.  In  circumstances  in  which  an  individual  establishes  a  risk  of
   persecution or treatment which engages the protection of the QD  in  one
   part of Iraq, it might be submitted by the respondent that there is - in
   the words of Article 8(1) of the Qualification Directive  and  paragraph
   339O of the Immigration Rules - a part of the country of origin in which
   there is no well-founded fear of being persecuted or  no  real  risk  of
   suffering serious harm and the applicant can reasonably be  expected  to
   stay in that part of the country.  Where that is  asserted,  the  Senior
   President of Tribunals stated at [33] of  SC  Jamaica  [2017]  EWCA  Civ
   2112; [2018] 1 WLR 4004 that the issue of the reasonableness of internal
   relocation involves three separate  questions.   Firstly,  what  is  the
   location to which it is proposed the person could move?   Secondly,  are
   there real risks of serious harm or persecution in this place?  Thirdly,
   if not, is it reasonable or not unduly harsh to  expect  the  person  to
   relocate to this place?  At [36] of SC (Jamaica), the  Senior  President
   (with whom Henderson and Davis LJJ agreed) stated  that  the  evaluative
   exercise is intended to be holistic and that no burden  or  standard  of
   proof arises  in  relation  to  the  overall  issue  of  whether  it  is
   reasonable to internally relocate.  We understand that dictum  to  apply
   to each of the three questions posed by the Senior President at [33].

399. At [141]-[149] of her written submissions, and at  [55]  of  the  first
   and second appellant's written submissions,  the  parties  consider  the
   possibility of relocation with reference  to  three  areas:  within  the
   Formerly Contested Areas, to the IKR or to Baghdad.  We consider each in
   turn.

Relocation within the Formerly Contested Areas (and Disputed Territories)
400. As  a  result  of  the  respondent's  concession  in  AA  (Iraq)  (that
   situation in the Contested Areas, as they then were)  generally  reached
   the Art 15(c)  threshold,  the  possibility  of  relocation  within  the
   Formerly Contested Areas has not previously arisen for consideration  in
   a country guidance decision.  That  concession  having  been  withdrawn,
   however, the respondent made it clear in  her  written  submissions,  at
   [148]-[149] in particular, that relocation within the Formerly Contested
   Areas  was  a  possibility  upon  which  she  relied,  albeit  that  she
   recognised the 'particular care' which was necessary in doing so.

401. The UNHCR urges more than particular care in this respect.   Under  the
   sub-heading 'Areas of Iraq where an IFA/IRA is not available', the UNHCR
   straightforwardly discounts the possibility  of  relocation  within  the
   Formerly Contested Areas or the Disputed Territories for  the  following
   reasons:

         UNHCR considers that an IFA/IRA is not available in areas  formerly
         controlled by ISIS or otherwise affected by conflict  in  light  of
         continued human rights violations and abuses by state and non-state
         actors, continued ISIS  presence  and  ongoing  anti-ISIS  military
         operations in these areas.

         UNHCR further considers that an IFA/IRA is  not  available  in  the
         disputed areas due to these areas'  sensitive  security,  political
         and demographic dynamics and the risk of further destabilizing  the
         situation through population movements, including in the  Districts
         of Kirkuk, Khanaqin (Diyala Governorate) and Tuz Khurmatu (Salah Al-
         Din Governorate).

402. Whilst we are required to attach  significance  to  the  views  of  the
    UNHCR, we consider these statements to be somewhat too prescriptive and
    to apply too broad  a  brush  to  the  situation  in  the  areas  under
    consideration.  We have concluded that the situation  in  the  formerly
    contested areas does not in general (with one exception) engage Article
    15(c).  And we do not consider that the  return  of  an  individual  to
    those areas would in general breach Article 3 ECHR.  In so  concluding,
    however, we have recognised that the situation is different in each  of
    the governorates under consideration and at  a  more  localised  level.
    For example, although the situation in Western Mosul will not generally
    contravene Article 3 ECHR, it might be thought that  relocation  to  an
    area with such badly damaged infrastructure  and  other  such  problems
    would  be  unduly  harsh  or  unreasonable  under  Article  8  QD.   We
    respectfully disagree with the UNHCR's view that relocation within  the
    Formerly Contested Areas must be ruled out in all cases; there  may  be
    some cases in which an individual could safely and reasonably  relocate
    within the Formerly Contested Areas.

403. All must depend on the facts and there must, in the  context  of  Iraq,
    be an assessment of  the  three  factors.   As  in  any  assessment  of
    internal relocation under the Refugee Convention or  the  Qualification
    Directive, a decision maker must assess whether a place  of  relocation
    would  be  safe  for  the  individual  applicant  and  whether  he  can
    reasonably be expected to stay in that part of the country.  Whether as
    part of the latter enquiry or as a freestanding consideration, it  will
    also be necessary to  consider  whether  the  individual  can  feasibly
    access and reside in the  place  of  relocation.   The  UNHCR  provides
    valuable guidance on each of  these  issues  (safety,  feasibility  and
    reasonableness), and we rely significantly  on  that  guidance  in  our
    analysis.

404. Safety.  There is, as we have explained at length, no  general  Article
    15(c) or Article 3 ECHR risk throughout the Formerly  Contested  Areas.
    Where an individual originates from that small  part  of  the  Formerly
    Contested Areas in which there is a  general  Article  15(c)  risk,  or
    where it is found as a result of the sliding scale  analysis  that  the
    article is engaged by  reference  to  their  particular  circumstances,
    relocation  within  the  Formerly  Contested  Areas  or  the   Disputed
    Territories may obviate the risk to that individual.    In  the  latter
    type of case, a decision-maker will be required to consider whether the
    specific circumstances which engaged the sliding scale in the home area
    will  continue  to  be  relevant  in  the  place  of  relocation.   The
    significance of ethno-religious identity will vary from area  to  area,
    for example.

405. Feasibility.  On 25 April 2019,  the  UNHCR  issued  a  position  paper
    entitled Access and Residency Requirements in Iraq: Ability of  Persons
    Originating from Formerly  ISIS  held  or  Conflict-Affected  Areas  to
    Legally Access and Remain in Proposed Areas  of  Relocation.   It  made
    clear that people from these  areas  (particularly  Sunni  Arabs)  were
    likely to require the following in order to settle in another  area:  a
    sponsor, a recommendation from the local mukhtar and security clearance
    from the relevant agencies.  (These documents are over  and  above  the
    ordinary requirement for  civil  status  documentation,  without  which
    freedom of movement and subsistence are impossible in any  event).   In
    Diyala, these were  known  to  be  the  requirements  but  in  Khanaqin
    District, an individual would  be  required  to  produce  letters  from
    National Security and Intelligence in addition.  In Kirkuk, sponsorship
    requirements had been lifted  but  a  support  letter  from  the  local
    mukhtar in the proposed areas of settlement  would  be  required.   The
    respondent's  February  2019  CPIN  on   Internal   Relocation,   civil
    documentation  and  returns  serves,  at  8.1.1  to  confirm  that  the
    situation regarding entry  to  Kirkuk  is  somewhat  restrictive.   The
    material cited therein is from the Danish Fact Finding Report.  We note
    that the  UNHCR's  May  2019  guidance  underlines  the  importance  of
    considering whether an individual can take up  residency  and  'durably
    remain' in the area under consideration, particularly with reference to
    Sunni Arabs and Sunni Turkmen.

406. Viewed in context, we find these statements unsurprising.  As  we  have
    demonstrated with reference to qualitative and quantitative  data,  the
    situation in Iraq is incomparable to how it was  in  the  period  2014-
    2017.  A (massively depleted)  threat  from  ISIL  and  other  security
    challenges remain, however, and it is clear that the security  agencies
    including the  PMU  are  rigorous  about  checking  the  identities  of
    individuals who travel from one area to another.  That they should make
    further checks in the event that an  individual  seeks  not  merely  to
    travel,  but  to  settle,  is  the  understandable  product   of   this
    environment, and particularly so in the Formerly Contested  Areas.   In
    the event that an individual has a connection with a proposed place  of
    relocation in the Formerly Contested Areas, we see no reason  why  they
    would be unable to secure  the  necessary  documentation  in  order  to
    settle in such an area.  In the event that there is no such connection,
    however, we consider it is unlikely to be feasible for  a  person  from
    within the Formerly Contested Areas to relocate within that area.

407. Reasonableness.  We record that we were not  presented  with  extensive
    argument on the correct approach to  this  question.   Insofar  as  the
    speeches in Januzi [2006] UKHL 5; [2006] 2 AC 426 and AH (Sudan) [2007]
    UKHL 49; [2008] 1 AC 678 generated controversy which was considered  at
    length in AAH (Iraq), the argument has been settled by the decision  of
    the Court of Appeal in AS  (Afghanistan)  [2019]  EWCA  Civ  873.   The
    dominant test is as expressed by Lord Bingham at [21] of Januzi:

         The decision maker, taking account of all relevant circumstances
         pertaining to the claimant and his country of origin, must decide
         whether it is reasonable to expect the claimant to relocate or
         whether it would be unduly harsh to expect him to do so.

408. We bear in mind, but shall not set out, the additional  guidance  given
    by Underhill LJ (with whom King and Singh LJJ agreed)  at  [61]  of  AS
    (Afghanistan).  In particular, we bear in mind the injunction that  the
    assessment must be holistic, taking account of all the circumstances of
    the  proposed  place  of  relocation  and  the  circumstances  of   the
    particular individual.  It is in the context of that  instruction  that
    we  hesitate  before  giving  guidance  which  might  be  thought   too
    prescriptive; what might be unduly harsh or unreasonable  (these  being
    two sides of the same coin)  for  one  individual,  might  not  be  for
    another.  We nevertheless consider that the general position in respect
    of the Formerly Contested Areas is as set out by the UNHCR.  Given  the
    multitudinous problems faced by those in the Formerly  Contested  Areas
    and the Disputed Territories, it will  often  be  unreasonable  for  an
    individual to relocate within that  area.   Whilst  the  conditions  in
    those areas do not cross the threshold for Article 15(c) or  Article  3
    ECHR protection, the humanitarian considerations  in  those  areas  are
    such that it will often be unreasonable  to  expect  an  individual  to
    resettle there.

409. The position in respect of those  who  are  able  to  access  a  viable
    support network in a proposed place of relocation within  the  Formerly
    Contested Areas is potentially different.  An individual who  seeks  to
    relocate, for example, from the mountainous area near  Baiji  in  which
    ISIL have doctrinal control could potentially relocate  to  Baiji  city
    without undue hardship if he is  found  to  have  a  supportive  family
    network  there.   In  any  such  case,  decision-makers  will  need  to
    undertake a holistic  assessment,  taking  into  account  the  personal
    characteristics of the individual in question and the situation in  the
    area of proposed relocation. Whilst  relocation  within  this  area  is
    likely to be the exception rather than the  rule,  we  agree  with  the
    respondent that the assessment requires particular care,  and  disagree
    with the UNHCR's conclusion that it is to be ruled out altogether.

Relocation to Baghdad
410. Safety.  Section D of the country guidance given in AA (Iraq) has  been
    in place since 2015.  We will not  quote  that  guidance  here;  it  is
    reproduced at Annex A.  As a general  matter,  the  Tribunal  concluded
    that relocation to Baghdad would not generally be unreasonable  but  it
    suggested a list of factors which should be considered in assessing the
    possibility.  BA (Iraq) Iraq CG [2017] UKUT 18 (IAC) supplemented  that
    guidance; it did not replace it.  Both decisions were issued at a  time
    when ISIL remained in control of a significant part of Iraq,  prompting
    and perpetuating massive population movements across the country.


411. The  safety  in  Baghdad  City  and  the  Baghdad  Belts  has  improved
    immeasurably since the previous country guidance decisions were  issued
    and we anticipate that it will often be  submitted  by  the  respondent
    that an individual who is at risk in another part of Iraq can  relocate
    to the capital or its environs.  Whether such relocation is safe  is  a
    fact-specific assessment; we do not consider there to  be  any  general
    risk contravening the QD or the ECHR in this area.  The presence of any
    of the enhanced risk factors at [313]-[315] above will  necessarily  be
    relevant when considering the specific risk to  an  individual  in  the
    capital, however.  As we have stated above, the identification of those
    risk factors by the UNHCR  and  EASO  serves  to  confirm  the  ongoing
    application of the country guidance in BA (Iraq).

412. Feasibility. It is in the respondent's closing written submissions,  at
    [145], that we find reference to background material  which  identifies
    the documents required by an individual  from  the  Formerly  Contested
    Areas who wishes to remain in Baghdad.   The  document  cited  in  that
    paragraph is a letter from the UNHCR in Jordan to the Legal Counsel  in
    the Netherlands regarding 'Guidance on the Application of  an  Internal
    Flight Alternative or  Internal  Relocation  Alternative  (IFA/IRA)  in
    Baghdad, Iraq.  The letter is dated 5 February 2018; a matter of months
    after the military defeat of ISIL.  At that stage,  UNHCR  stated  that
    those originating from ISIL-held areas or areas  affected  by  conflict
    and who seek to settle in these areas  of  Baghdad  (be  it  with  host
    families  or  in  rented  apartments)  must,  in  principle,  meet  the
    following cumulative requirements:

         (a) A support  letter  from  the  Mukhtar  and  the  Local  Council
         confirming that the individual is residing (or intending to reside)
         in the particular neighbourhood/local council area;


         (b) Security clearance from  five  different  security  authorities
         (National  Security,  Federal  Police  Intelligence,  Local  Police
         Intelligence, Baghdad Operations, ISF Intelligence); and


         (c) Sponsorship from a resident of the neighbourhood in which  s/he
         seeks to settle.  The sponsor must present four pieces of  personal
         documentation, i.e. ID card, nationality certificate, address  card
         (only accepted if issued in  the  sponsor's  name)  and  ration/PDS
         (Public Distribution System) card. In some cases,  the  sponsor  is
         reportedly asked for additional documentation  such  as  a  support
         letter from the  Mukhtar  or  Local  Council  confirming  that  the
         sponsor is a resident of that area.

413. This information is attributed  to  a  previous  UNHCR  publication  in
    April 2017, as cited at footnote 9 of the report.  In the  EASO  report
    on Internal Mobility, the same UNHCR report is cited at 3.1.1,  and  we
    see the same three bullet  points  under  the  sub-heading  'Legal  and
    Practical Requirements to stay in Baghdad'.   On  25  April  2019,  the
    UNHCR published the paper on relocation on relocation from the Formerly
    Contested Areas which we have already cited above.  This  paper  begins
    by stating that it was intended to update the April  2017  information.
    It continues with the following reflection on the changing situation:

         In the face of large-scale displacement  of  people  due  to  ISIS'
         expansion and subsequent anti-ISIS military operations between 2014
         and 2017, many local authorities  introduced  stringent  entry  and
         residency  restrictions,  including,  among   others,   sponsorship
         requirements and, in  some  areas,  near-complete  entry  bans  for
         persons fleeing from  ISIS-held  or  conflict  areas,  particularly
         Sunni Arabs. At the time of writing, security screenings remain  in
         place for persons  from  formerly  ISIS-held  or  conflict-affected
         areas. Access bans have been lifted while sponsorship  requirements
         remain in place for entry to and residency in several  governorates
         for persons from formerly ISIS-held areas. At the time of  writing,
         persons  from  formerly  ISIS-held  or   conflict-affected   areas,
         particularly Sunni Arabs (including persons who  returned  to  Iraq
         from a third country) require a sponsor for access to the following
         governorates: [Basrah, Dhi-Qar,  Missan,  Muthanna,  Qadisiyah  and
         Dohuk]

414. The report states that no sponsor is required  for  entry  to  Baghdad,
    Babel, Diyala, Erbil, Kerbala, Kirkuk, Najef, Sulaymaniyah  and  Wassit
    Governorate.  It continues,  however,  that  the  position  as  regards
    residency is different.  In order to reside in Baghdad,  an  individual
    from the Formerly Contested Areas will require security  clearance  and
    "two sponsors from the neighbourhood in which they intend to reside  as
    well as a support letter from  the  local  mukhtar".   We  have  little
    evidence about the operation of those requirements in practice and  are
    compelled to draw our own inferences.  When considering the feasibility
    of an individual complying with these requirements, we think  that  the
    position in Baghdad is very likely to be different from the position in
    the Formerly Contested Areas or the Disputed Territories.  The security
    situation in those areas is decidedly more tense than it is in Baghdad,
    in which security and freedom of movement is such that the  Green  Zone
    has opened to the public.  There is some evidence of IDP  camps  around
    Baghdad being closed  and  some  evidence  of  individuals  from  areas
    formerly controlled by ISIL being pressured to return  to  those  areas
    (the UNHCR letter of 25 April 2019 refers, for example).  But there  is
    nothing before us to suggest that a documented  individual  of  working
    age who is returned to the capital, potentially with a grant under  the
    Voluntary Returns Scheme, would be unable to secure two sponsors and  a
    support letter from the local mukhtar of the area in which they propose
    to reside.  Were there any such problem, we would have  expected  there
    to be more evidence of people in this category being refused  residence
    in Baghdad.  The UNHCR  in  particular  does  not  refer  to  any  such
    difficulties, and the evidence presented to us about Baghdad  does  not
    reflect the extensive concern over  secondary  displacement  which  has
    been voiced in respect of other areas.

415. Reasonableness.  The UNHCR's May 2019 position in relation  to  Baghdad
    is that 'external support' is  necessary  in  all  cases  except  "Arab
    Shi'ite and Arab Sunni single able-bodied men and  married  couples  of
    working  age  without  children   and   without   identified   specific
    vulnerabilities". External support is defined as "a support network  of
    members of his or her family, extended family or tribe in the  area  of
    prospective relocation, who have been assessed to be willing  and  able
    to provide genuine support to the applicant in practice".

416. The UNHCR's position was adopted  by  the  appellants  before  us,  and
    section G of the first and second appellant's Schedule was directed  to
    supporting this position.  We take the respondent  to  agree  with  the
    conclusion of the UNHCR in this  respect.   At  [146]  of  her  closing
    submissions, she submits that  relocation  to  Baghdad  is  'likely  to
    remain a viable and reasonable area of relocation for  both  Sunni  and
    Shia Arab male and/or married returnees of working age'. We endorse the
    broad agreement between the parties  and  the  UNHCR  as  regards  this
    category  of  individuals.   Although  Baghdad  continues  to  host   a
    significant number of IDPs, we see no reason why  it  would  be  unduly
    harsh or unreasonable in the generality of such cases for  an  such  an
    individual to relocate to Baghdad.  In respect of  those  who  are  not
    Arab Shi'ite and Arab Sunni single able-bodied men or  married  couples
    of  working  age  without  children  and  without  identified  specific
    vulnerabilities,  the  respondent  did  not  positively   assert   that
    relocation to Baghdad would be reasonable in the  absence  of  external
    support there.  In the absence of any such submission, we  endorse  the
    appellants' submission, drawing as it does  on  the  expertise  of  the
    UNHCR.   It  will  remain  necessary  in  any  case  to   consider   an
    individual's ability to relocate to Baghdad  holistically,  even  where
    they fall into this category or where they have viable support  in  the
    capital.


Relocation to the IKR
417. The Country Guidance given in AAH (Iraq) was a little more than a  year
    old when we heard these appeals.  The respondent's only  submission  in
    relation to relocation there (made at  [147]  of  her  closing  written
    submissions, was that the evidence suggested  that  there  had  been  a
    relaxation of the requirements for obtaining sponsorship on the part of
    ethnic Kurds from the Formerly  Contested  Areas  wishing  to  relocate
    there.  On the appellants' behalf, it was submitted that relocation  to
    the KRI was only possible in a limited number of cases and  that  Kurds
    from the Formerly Contested Areas might be at risk of serious  harm  in
    the IKR: [56]-[57].


418. The significant change since AAH (Iraq) was decided is that  there  are
    now flights directly to the IKR from the UK and that removal  from  the
    UK to Erbil or Sulaymaniyah is therefore possible.  This  is  confirmed
    by EASO and by Dr Fatah, who has travelled to Sulaymaniyah  on  such  a
    flight.  This might be of  particular  significance  in  two  respects.
    Firstly, it may have an impact on  the  ability  of  an  individual  to
    obtain replacement civil  status  documentation  from  his  home  area,
    particularly where that is in the  IKR  or  the  Disputed  Territories.
    Secondly, it will (in a case  in  which  the  respondent  gives  proper
    notice that this is to be the route of return)  obviate  the  need  for
    decision makers to consider what risk,  if  any,  might  arise  between
    Baghdad and an individual's home area.  When it  is  suggested  by  the
    respondent that an individual who is not  from  the  IKR  can  relocate
    there, however, the  critical  questions  of  safety,  feasibility  and
    reasonableness  remain,  regardless  of  the  location  to  which   the
    individual would actually be returned.

419. Safety.  Whilst a comprehensive assessment of the level of security  in
    the IKR lies beyond the scope of this decision, there is nothing in the
    evidence which suggests that the position  in  the  IKR  is  materially
    different from the assessment in AAH (Iraq).  There is no general  risk
    there, whether under Article 15(c) or Article 3 ECHR.  Dr Fatah  agreed
    during his oral evidence that it is "almost completely violence  free".
    It is quite clear  that  certain  individuals  might  have  a  specific
    profile which would cause them to be at risk,  however,  and  decisions
    makers should once again turn to the enhanced risk  factors  listed  at
    [313]-[315] above in order to consider whether  an  individual  fleeing
    another part of Iraq might nevertheless be at risk  in  the  KRG.   The
    importance of three such factors (actual or  implied  association  with
    ISIL, coming from  an  ISIL  area,  and  being  of  fighting  age)  was
    highlighted in AAH (Iraq) and those factors continue to be  potentially
    significant depending, as always, on the other facts  of  the  case  in
    question.


420. Feasibility.  We are particularly assisted by the UNHCR  document  from
    25 April 2019, which confirms that  on-entry  sponsorship  requirements
    for Erbil and Sulaymaniyah were lifted in early 2019.  (This represents
    the latest information, and  is  of  greater  assistance  than  earlier
    material cited at section E of the appellants' Schedule).   In  respect
    of Dohuk, the third of the governorates in the  IKR,  the  position  is
    said by the UNHCR to be as follows:

         Dohuk Governorate:  Arabs  from  formerly  ISIS-held  or  conflict-
         affected areas and  Turkmen  from  Tal  Afar  (Ninewa  Governorate)
         require a sponsor in order to enter, unless they obtain a temporary
         travel authorization from the checkpoint near Hatara village.  This
         authorization is  issued  for  short-term  visits  for  medical  or
         similar reason.

421. In respect of residency, the UNHCR  describe  the  position  to  be  as
    follows in the IKR:

         Dohuk Governorate:  Arabs  from  formerly  ISIS-held  or  conflict-
         affected areas and Turkmen from Tal Afar (Ninewa Governorate)  must
         regularize their stay by obtaining  the  approval  from  the  local
         Asayish, based on  which  they  obtain  a  residency  permit.  When
         approaching the Asayish, the individual must be accompanied by  the
         sponsor who had facilitated his/her entry into Dohuk.


         In Erbil and Sulaymaniyah Governorates,  persons  originating  from
         outside  the  KR-I  must  approach  the  local   Asayish   in   the
         neighbourhood in which they seek to reside in  order  to  obtain  a
         residency card. They do not require  a  sponsor.  Single  Arab  and
         Turkmen men, however, require regular employment and must submit  a
         support letter from their employer in order to obtain  a  one-year,
         renewable residency card. Those without regular employment  receive
         only a one-month renewable residency card. Holders of  a  one-month
         residency card face difficulties in finding regular employment  due
         to the short duration of their permits.

422. There is nothing before us which contradicts the views of the UNHCR  in
    this respect, and we treat those views as conclusive of the  issue.  As
    regards Kurds, therefore, the position remains as it was at the time of
    AAH (Iraq): there is no requirement for a sponsor in any of  the  three
    IKR governorates, whether for entry  or  residency.   As  regards  non-
    Kurds, there are no sponsorship requirements for entry or residence  in
    Erbil and  Sulaymaniyah,  although  single  Arab  and  Turkmen  require
    regular employment in order to secure  residency.   Arabs  from  former
    conflict areas and Turkmen from Tal Afar  are  subject  to  sponsorship
    requirements to enter or reside in Dohuk.

423. Reasonableness.  In their May 2019 paper, the UNHCR  expressed  serious
    concerns about the  ability  of  the  KRI  to  absorb  more  internally
    displaced people.  It noted that  the  region  hosts  40%  of  the  1.7
    million IDPs from Iraq, and nearly all of the 250,000  Syrian  refugees
    in the country.  As Dr Fatah emphasised before us, the region  is  also
    experiencing a period of significant economic decline,  rising  poverty
    levels and decreasing international assistance.  IDPs find it difficult
    to find employment which covers their basic needs, and this problem  is
    felt particularly amongst Arabs, against whom there is  discrimination.
    As the Tribunal held in AAH (Iraq), patronage and nepotism continue  to
    be important factors in securing employment, placing those who  do  not
    originate from the area at further  disadvantage.   Relocation  to  IDP
    camps is not necessarily  available,  as  they  are  subject  to  space
    limitations  and  waiting  lists.   Individuals  without  support   may
    therefore be required to live in critical  shelter  arrangements.   The
    UNHCR's stance is therefore that internal relocation within the IKR  is
    not generally available as a result of the humanitarian situation.  The
    only exceptions to that general stance are where it can be  established
    that the individual would have access to:


         (i) Adequate shelter in the proposed area of relocation in the  KR-
         I, noting that IDP camps or informal settlements would not  qualify
         as "adequate shelter";


         (ii)  Access  to  essential  services  in  the  proposed  area   of
         relocation in the KR-I,  such  as  potable  water  and  sanitation,
         electricity, health care and education; and


         (iii) Livelihood opportunities; or in the case  of  applicants  who
         cannot be expected to provide for their own livelihood (for example
         female-headed households, elderly  applicants  or  applicants  with
         disabilities), proven and sustainable support to enable  access  to
         an adequate standard of living.


424. We consider the position to be as follows.   An  Arab  with  no  viable
    support network in  the  IKR  is  likely  to  experience  unduly  harsh
    conditions upon relocation  there.   We  think  it  unlikely  that  the
    respondent would  submit  that  such  an  individual  could  reasonably
    relocate to the IKR and  certainly  no  such  submission  was  actively
    pursued before us.   In  respect  of  a  Kurdish  individual  from  the
    Formerly Contested Areas, the UNHCR's stance essentially replicates the
    guidance  given  in  AAH(Iraq),  albeit  in  a  more  compressed  form.
    Decision makers must consider whether a Kurdish returnee has  a  viable
    support network in accordance with that decision.  In  the  event  that
    they do not, consideration must be given to their individual's specific
    circumstances with a  view  to  determining  their  ability  to  secure
    accommodation and employment in the IKR.  It will be unreasonable for a
    Kurdish individual to relocate from the Formerly Contested Areas to the
    IKR in the absence of a viable support network or  the  means  to  find
    accommodation and employment in accordance with  the  guidance  in  AAH
    (Iraq), the ongoing application of which is confirmed.

                        SECTION H - COUNTRY GUIDANCE

425. We were not asked to revisit Part B of the existing  country  guidance,
    which will remain in place.  As a result  of  the  durable  changes  in
    Iraq, however, the remainder  of  the  guidance  issued  in  AA  (Iraq)
    requires significant revision and the guidance  in  BA  (Iraq)  can  no
    longer stand.  As we have explained, the more recent guidance issued in
    AAH (Iraq) requires only limited revision, reflecting the resumption of
    direct flights to the IKR and the introduction  of  the  INID,  amongst
    other matters.  The amended guidance, in full, is as follows:


     B. INDISCRIMINATE VIOLENCE IN IRAQ: ARTICLE 15(C) OF THE  QUALIFICATION
        DIRECTIVE


    30. There continues to be an internal armed conflict in certain parts of
        Iraq, involving government forces, various militia and the  remnants
        of ISIL.  Following the military defeat of ISIL at the end  of  2017
        and the  resulting  reduction  in  levels  of  direct  and  indirect
        violence, however, the intensity of that conflict is not such  that,
        as a general matter, there are  substantial  grounds  for  believing
        that any civilian  returned  to  Iraq,  solely  on  account  of  his
        presence  there,  faces  a  real  risk   of   being   subjected   to
        indiscriminate violence amounting to serious harm within  the  scope
        of Article 15(c) QD.


    31. The only exception to the general conclusion above is in respect  of
        the small mountainous area north of Baiji in Salah al-Din, which  is
        marked on the map at Annex D.  ISIL continues to exercise  doctrinal
        control over that area and the risk of indiscriminate violence there
        is such as to engage Article 15(c) as a general matter.

    32. The situation in the Formerly Contested Areas (the  governorates  of
        Anbar,  Diyala,  Kirkuk,  Ninewah  and  Salah  Al-Din)  is  complex,
        encompassing ethnic, political and humanitarian issues which  differ
        by region.  Whether the return of an  individual  to  such  an  area
        would be  contrary  to  Article  15(c)  requires  a  fact-sensitive,
        "sliding scale"  assessment  to  which  the  following  matters  are
        relevant.

    33. Those with an actual or perceived association with ISIL  are  likely
        to be at enhanced risk throughout Iraq.  In  those  areas  in  which
        ISIL retains an active presence, those who have a  current  personal
        association with  local  or  national  government  or  the  security
        apparatus are likely to be at enhanced risk.


    34.  The  impact  of  any  of  the  personal   characteristics   listed
        immediately below must be carefully assessed against the  situation
        in the area  to  which  return  is  contemplated,  with  particular
        reference to the extent of ongoing ISIL activity and the  behaviour
        of the security  actors  in  control  of  that  area.   Within  the
        framework of such an analysis, the other  personal  characteristics
        which are capable of being relevant, individually and cumulatively,
        to the sliding scale analysis required  by  Article  15(c)  are  as
        follows:


          . Opposition to or  criticism  of  the  GOI,  the  KRG  or  local
            security actors;


          . Membership of a national, ethnic or religious  group  which  is
            either in the minority in the area in question, or  not  in  de
            facto control of that area;


          . LGBTI individuals, those not conforming to  Islamic  mores  and
            wealthy or Westernised individuals;


          . Humanitarian or medical staff and those associated with Western
            organisations or security forces;


          . Women and children without genuine family support; and


          . Individuals with disabilities.

    35. The living conditions in Iraq as a  whole,  including  the  Formerly
        Contested Areas, are unlikely to give rise to a breach of Article  3
        ECHR or  (therefore)  to  necessitate  subsidiary  protection  under
        Article 15(b) QD.  Where it is asserted that return to a  particular
        part of Iraq would give rise to such a breach, however, it is to  be
        recalled that the minimum level of severity  required  is  relative,
        according to the personal circumstances of the individual concerned.
         Any such circumstances require  individualised  assessment  in  the
        context of the conditions of the area in question.

    B.   DOCUMENTATION AND FEASIBILITY OF RETURN (EXCLUDING IKR)

    36. Return of former residents of the Iraqi Kurdish Region (IKR) will be
        to the IKR and all other  Iraqis  will  be  to  Baghdad.  The  Iraqi
        authorities will allow an Iraqi national (P) in the  United  Kingdom
        to enter Iraq only if P is in possession of  a  current  or  expired
        Iraqi passport relating to P, or a Laissez Passer.


    37. No Iraqi national will be returnable to Baghdad if not in possession
        of one of these documents.

    38. In the light of the Court of Appeal's  judgment  in  HF  (Iraq)  and
        Others v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2013] EWCA  Civ
        1276, an international protection claim made by P cannot succeed  by
        reference to any alleged risk of harm arising from an absence  of  a
        current or expired Iraqi  passport  or  a  Laissez  passer,  if  the
        Tribunal finds that P's return is not currently feasible on  account
        of a lack of any of those documents.

    39. Where P is returned to Iraq on a Laissez Passer or expired passport,
        P will be at no risk of serious harm  at  the  point  of  return  by
        reason of not having a current passport.

    C.   CIVIL STATUS IDENTITY DOCUMENTATION


    40. The CSID is being replaced  with  a  new  biometric  Iraqi  National
        Identity Card - the INID.  As a general matter, it is necessary  for
        an individual to have one of these two documents in  order  to  live
        and travel within Iraq without encountering treatment or  conditions
        which are contrary to Article 3 ECHR.   Many of the  checkpoints  in
        the country are manned by Shia militia who are not controlled by the
        GOI and are unlikely to permit an individual without a  CSID  or  an
        INID  to  pass.   A  valid  Iraqi  passport  is  not  recognised  as
        acceptable proof of identity for internal travel.


    41. A Laissez Passer will be of no assistance in the absence of  a  CSID
        or an INID; it is confiscated upon arrival and is not, in any event,
        a recognised identity document.  There is insufficient  evidence  to
        show that returnees are issued  with  a  'certification  letter'  at
        Baghdad Airport,  or  to  show  that  any  such  document  would  be
        recognised internally as acceptable proof of identity.

    42. Notwithstanding the phased  transition  to  the  INID  within  Iraq,
        replacement  CSIDs   remain   available   through   Iraqi   Consular
        facilities.   Whether  an  individual  will  be  able  to  obtain  a
        replacement CSID whilst in the UK depends on the documents available
        and, critically, the availability of the volume and  page  reference
        of the entry in the Family Book in Iraq, which system  continues  to
        underpin the Civil Status Identity process.  Given the importance of
        that  information,  most  Iraqi  citizens  will  recall   it.   That
        information may also be obtained from family members, although it is
        necessary to consider whether such relatives are on the father's  or
        the mother's side because the registration system is patrilineal.

    43. Once in Iraq, it remains the case that an individual is expected  to
        attend their local CSA office  in  order  to  obtain  a  replacement
        document.  All CSA offices have now re-opened, although  the  extent
        to which records have been destroyed by the conflict  with  ISIL  is
        unclear, and is likely to vary significantly depending on the extent
        and intensity of the conflict in the area in question.

    44. An individual returnee who is not from Baghdad is not likely  to  be
        able to obtain a  replacement  document  there,  and  certainly  not
        within a reasonable time.   Neither  the  Central  Archive  nor  the
        assistance facilities for IDPs are likely  to  render  documentation
        assistance to an undocumented returnee.

    45. The likelihood of obtaining a replacement identity document  by  the
        use of a proxy, whether from the  UK  or  on  return  to  Iraq,  has
        reduced due to the introduction of the INID  system.   In  order  to
        obtain an INID, an individual must attend their local CSA office  in
        person to enrol their biometrics, including  fingerprints  and  iris
        scans.  The CSA offices in which INID terminals have been  installed
        are unlikely - as a result of the phased  replacement  of  the  CSID
        system - to issue a CSID, whether to an individual in person or to a
        proxy.   The reducing number of CSA offices in which INID  terminals
        have not been installed will continue to issue CSIDs to  individuals
        and their proxies upon production of the necessary information.

    D.   INTERNAL RELOCATION WITHIN GOI-CONTROLLED IRAQ

    46. Where internal relocation is raised in  the  Iraqi  context,  it  is
        necessary to consider not only  the  safety  and  reasonableness  of
        relocation but also the feasibility of  that  course,  in  light  of
        sponsorship and residency requirements in operation in various parts
        of the country.  Individuals who seek to relocate within the country
        may not be admitted  to  a  potential  safe  haven  or  may  not  be
        permitted to remain there.


    47. Relocation within the Formerly Contested Areas.  With the  exception
        of the small area identified in section A,  the  general  conditions
        within the Formerly Contested Areas do not engage Article  15  QD(b)
        or (c)  or  Article  3  ECHR  and  relocation  within  the  Formerly
        Contested Areas may obviate a risk which exists in  an  individual's
        home area.  Where relocation within the Formerly Contested Areas  is
        under contemplation, however, the ethnic and  political  composition
        of the home area and the place of relocation  will  be  particularly
        relevant.  In particular, an individual who lived in a  former  ISIL
        stronghold for some time may fall under  suspicion  in  a  place  of
        relocation.   Tribal  and  ethnic  differences  may  preclude   such
        relocation, given the significant presence and  control  of  largely
        Shia militia  in  these  areas.   Even  where  it  is  safe  for  an
        individual to relocate within the Formerly Contested Areas, however,
        it is unlikely to be either feasible or reasonable without  a  prior
        connection to, and a support structure within, the area in question.


    48. Relocation to Baghdad.   Baghdad  is  generally  safe  for  ordinary
        civilians but whether it is safe for  a  particular  returnee  is  a
        question of fact in the individual  case.   There  are  no  on-entry
        sponsorship requirements  for  Baghdad  but  there  are  sponsorship
        requirements for residency.  A documented individual of working  age
        is likely to be able to satisfy those requirements.   Relocation  to
        Baghdad is likely to be reasonable for Arab Shia and  Sunni  single,
        able-bodied men and married couples of working age without  children
        and without specific vulnerabilities.  Other individuals are  likely
        to require external support, ie a support network of members of  his
        or her family, extended family or tribe, who are willing and able to
        provide  genuine  support.   Whether  such  a  support  network   is
        available is to be considered with  reference  to  the  collectivist
        nature of Iraqi society, as considered in AAH (Iraq).



    E.   IRAQI KURDISH REGION

    49. There are regular direct flights from the UK to  the  Iraqi  Kurdish
        Region and returns might be to Baghdad or to that region.  It is for
        the respondent to state whether she intends to  remove  to  Baghdad,
        Erbil or Sulaymaniyah.


    Kurds
    50. For an Iraqi national returnee (P) of Kurdish origin  in  possession
        of a valid CSID or Iraqi National Identity Card (INID), the  journey
        from Baghdad to the IKR by land is affordable and practical and  can
        be made without a real risk  of  P  suffering  persecution,  serious
        harm, or Article 3 ill treatment nor would any difficulties  on  the
        journey make relocation unduly harsh.

    51. P is unable to board a domestic flight between Baghdad and  the  IKR
        without either a CSID, an INID or a valid passport.  If P has one of
        those documents, the journey from Baghdad to  the  IKR  by  land  is
        affordable and practical and can be made without a real  risk  of  P
        suffering persecution, serious harm, or Article 3 ill treatment  nor
        would any difficulties on the journey make relocation unduly harsh.

    52. P will face considerable difficulty in making  the  journey  between
        Baghdad and the IKR by land without a CSID or  an  INID.  There  are
        numerous checkpoints en route,  including  two  checkpoints  in  the
        immediate vicinity of the airport.  If P has neither a CSID  nor  an
        INID there is a real risk of P being detained at a checkpoint  until
        such time as the security personnel are able to verify P's identity.
         It is not reasonable to require P to travel between Baghdad and IKR
        by land absent the  ability  of  P  to  verify  his  identity  at  a
        checkpoint. This normally requires the attendance of a  male  family
        member and production of P's identity  documents  but  may  also  be
        achieved by calling upon "connections" higher up  in  the  chain  of
        command.

    53. Once at the IKR border (land or air) P  would  normally  be  granted
        entry  to  the  territory.  Subject  to  security   screening,   and
        registering presence with the local mukhtar, P would be permitted to
        enter and reside in the IKR with no  further  legal  impediments  or
        requirements. There are no sponsorship  requirements  for  entry  or
        residence in any of the three IKR Governorates for Kurds.

    54. Whether P would be at particular risk of  ill-treatment  during  the
        security screening process must be assessed on a case-by-case basis.
        Additional factors that may increase risk include: (i) coming from a
        family with a known association with ISIL, (ii) coming from an  area
        associated with ISIL and (iii) being a single male of fighting  age.
        P is likely to be able to evidence the fact of recent  arrival  from
        the UK, which would dispel any suggestion of having arrived directly
        from ISIL territory.

    55. If P has family members living  in  the  IKR  cultural  norms  would
        require that family to accommodate P. In such circumstances P would,
        in general, have sufficient assistance from the family so as to lead
        a 'relatively normal life', which would not be unduly harsh.  It  is
        nevertheless important for decision-makers to determine  the  extent
        of any assistance likely to be provided by P's family on a  case  by
        case basis.

    56.  For  Kurds  without  the  assistance  of  family  in  the  IKR  the
        accommodation options are limited:

        v) Absent special circumstances it is not reasonably likely that  P
           will be able to gain access to one of the refugee camps  in  the
           IKR; these camps  are  already  extremely  overcrowded  and  are
           closed to newcomers. 64% of IDPs  are  accommodated  in  private
           settings with the vast majority living with family members;


       vi) If P cannot live with a family member, apartments  in  a  modern
           block in a new neighbourhood are available for rent at a cost of
           between $300 and $400 per month;


      vii) P could resort to a 'critical shelter arrangement', living in an
           unfinished or  abandoned  structure,  makeshift  shelter,  tent,
           mosque, church or squatting in a government building.  It  would
           be unduly harsh to require P to relocate to the IKR  if  P  will
           live in a critical  housing  shelter  without  access  to  basic
           necessities such as food, clean water and clothing;

     viii)  In  considering  whether  P  would  be  able  to  access  basic
           necessities, account must be  taken  of  the  fact  that  failed
           asylum seekers are entitled to  apply  for  a  grant  under  the
           Voluntary Returns Scheme, which could give P  access  to  �1500.
           Consideration should also be  given  to  whether  P  can  obtain
           financial support from other sources such as (a) employment, (b)
           remittances from relatives abroad, (c) the  availability  of  ad
           hoc charity or by being able to access PDS rations.

    57. Whether P is able to secure employment must be assessed on a case-by-
        case basis taking the following matters into account:


      vii) Gender. Lone women are  very  unlikely  to  be  able  to  secure
           legitimate employment;


     viii) The unemployment rate for Iraqi IDPs living in the IKR is 70%;


       ix) P cannot work without a CSID or INID;

        x) Patronage and nepotism  continue  to  be  important  factors  in
           securing employment. A returnee with family connections  to  the
           region will have  a  significant  advantage  in  that  he  would
           ordinarily  be  able  to  call  upon  those  contacts  to   make
           introductions to prospective employers and to vouch for him;

       xi) Skills, education and experience. Unskilled workers are  at  the
           greatest disadvantage, with  the  decline  in  the  construction
           industry reducing the number of labouring jobs available;

      xii) If P is from an area with a marked association with  ISIL,  that
           may deter prospective employers.

    Non-Kurdish Returnees
    58. The ability of non-Kurdish returnees to relocate to the IKR is to be
        distinguished.  There are no sponsorship requirements for  entry  or
        residence in  Erbil  and  Sulaymaniyah,  although  single  Arab  and
        Turkmen citizens require  regular  employment  in  order  to  secure
        residency.  Arabs from former conflict areas and  Turkmen  from  Tal
        Afar are subject to sponsorship requirements to enter or  reside  in
        Dohuk. Although Erbil  and  Sulaymaniyah  are  accessible  for  such
        individuals, particular care must be  taken  in  evaluating  whether
        internal relocation to the IKR for a non-Kurd would  be  reasonable.
        Given the  economic  and  humanitarian  conditions  in  the  IKR  at
        present, an Arab with no viable support network in the IKR is likely
        to experience unduly harsh conditions upon relocation there.

    F.   EXISTING COUNTRY GUIDANCE DECISIONS


    30.  This decision replaces all existing country guidance on Iraq.



                     SECTION I - THE INDIVIDUAL APPEALS

426. The First Appellant -SMO.  This appellant is from Abu Mohammed  in  the
    Daquq District of Kirkuk.  His appeal was not pursued before the FtT on
    the basis that  he  was  eligible  for  protection  under  the  Refugee
    Convention but his account of  having  been  attacked  by  ISIL  whilst
    working as a shepherd was nevertheless rejected.  The judge in the  FtT
    departed from AA (Iraq) and concluded that the  appellant's  return  to
    his home area would not engage Article 15(c).  He  concluded  that  the
    appellant's family remained there and that he could return to them  and
    that there would be no breach of Article 3 ECHR.


427. In the Upper Tribunal, the  judge  was  found  to  have  erred  in  his
    decision to depart from the extant country guidance, which decision was
    in part based upon a decision of the Administrative Court - R  (on  the
    application of QA) v SSHD [2017] EWHC 2417 - which  he  had  failed  to
    draw to the attention of the parties.  The Upper Tribunal Judge did not
    accept that the FtT had erred in reaching its findings of primary fact,
    however, and directed that the appeal should be  remade  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal, based upon the findings of fact reached at first instance.


428. We have concluded that the conditions in the appellant's home  area  do
    not cross the Article 15(c) threshold in the generality of cases.   The
    appellant is from Kirkuk, however, and the judge reached  his  findings
    that the appellant's case disclosed no enhanced risk factors two  years
    ago.  It is appropriate that the appellant should have the  opportunity
    to make submissions on whether any of the enhanced risk factors we have
    set out do apply to him and, if so, whether it would be reasonable  for
    him to avoid such a risk by relocating internally.  We might have  been
    able to undertake that task for ourselves on the basis of  the  judge's
    findings, with the benefit of further written submissions.


429. We are unable to decide the Article 3 ECHR  ground  of  appeal  on  the
    basis of the findings of fact reached by the FtT, however.   The  judge
    concluded that the appellant could return to Kirkuk but he carried  out
    an inadequate consideration of the appellant's ability  to  get  there.
    As we have explained, the appellant would require a CSID or an INID  in
    order to return to his home area.  Without either of  these  documents,
    he would not be able to navigate the checkpoints within and en route to
    Kirkuk.  The judge concluded that the appellant's  CSID  is  'possibly'
    still at the family home in Kirkuk.  He concluded that the family  were
    still at the family home in Kirkuk and that the appellant would be able
    to use documents from the family home in order to obtain  a  CSID  from
    the CSA office in Kirkuk.


430. The starting point, in  considering  this  issue,  must  always  be  to
    consider and to make a finding about the actual availability of a  CSID
    or INID.  In the event that the appellant's CSID is at home in  Kirkuk,
    it can be sent to him in the UK or taken to him upon  arrival  in  Iraq
    and there will be no breach of Article 3 ECHR as he travels to  Kirkuk.
     The judge's conclusion that the CSID is "possibly" at the  appellant's
    home represents no finding on this crucial issue.  Nor,  with  respect,
    was the judge's alternative  analysis  of  whether  the  appellant  can
    obtain a replacement document adequate.   He failed to consider whether
    the appellant  has  or  could  obtain  the  necessary  information  and
    evidence to obtain a replacement  CSID  whilst  he  is  in  the  United
    Kingdom and he failed thereafter to consider whether the appellant  has
    or could obtain the necessary information to obtain a replacement  CSID
    on return to Iraq.


431. In any event, as we have noted, matters have moved on as  the  CSID  is
    being phased out and replaced by the INID.  If, as appears  to  be  the
    case, the judge in the FtT concluded that the appellant would  be  able
    to use a proxy to obtain a replacement CSID  from  the  CSA  office  in
    Kirkuk, we cannot be sure that this represents the  position  in  2019.
    It is likely, to our mind, that the CSA office in Kirkuk  has  an  INID
    terminal and that it would not be  willing  to  issue  a  CSID  to  the
    appellant through a proxy.  In  the  circumstances,  we  consider  that
    there must be further findings made regarding this  appellant's  access
    to or ability to obtain a CSID card.  In the event  that  he  does  not
    have access to an  existing  CSID  card  and  is  unable  to  obtain  a
    replacement whilst he is in the UK, we think it likely that his  return
    to Iraq would be in breach of Article 3 ECHR.  As we have explained, we
    do not consider that he would be able to obtain either  a  CSID  or  an
    INID in Baghdad because he is not from that city.

432. Mr Knafler invited us to remit the first appellant's appeal to the  FtT
    for further findings of fact in light of the country guidance  we  were
    minded to issue.  We do adopt that course, since the assessment of  the
    Article 3 ECHR ground will require further evidence

433. The Second Appellant - KSP.  The second appellant is a Sunni Kurd  from
    Tuz Khurmato in Salah al-Din.  He claimed to have run a barbershop  and
    to have been approached by a Kurdish client who tried to recruit him to
    ISIL.  His account was that he informed the police about these advances
    and that an attempt was made to arrest the  man  and  his  fellow  ISIL
    members, two of whom were then arrested.  The appellant stated that his
    shop was then blown up by ISIL and that he left Iraq after spending two
    weeks with family in Laylan.

434. In the FtT, the judge  rejected  the  appellant's  primary  account  of
    difficulties with ISIL.  He found that the appellant  could  return  to
    Tuz Khurmato in safety, or that he could  relocate  to  his  family  in
    Laylan.  The judge (who also decided the case of the  first  appellant)
    concluded that he could depart from the existing  country  guidance  in
    reaching that conclusion.  In  relation  to  documentation,  the  judge
    concluded  that  the  appellant  would  have  documents  at  his  home,
    'possibly' including his CSID.  In any event, the judge concluded  that
    the appellant would be able to  obtain  a  replacement  CSID  with  the
    assistance of his documents and his friends.

435. The appeals brought to the Upper  Tribunal  by  the  first  and  second
    appellants were decided by different judges.  Like  the  judge  in  the
    first appellant's appeal, however, the Upper Tribunal judge in the case
    of KSP concluded that the FtT had erred in departing from the  existing
    country guidance.  Although he preserved the findings of fact regarding
    the appellant's account, he set aside the risk assessment conducted  by
    the FtT in relation to the Refugee Convention, HP and Article 3 ECHR.

436. Mr Knafler invited us to remit this appeal to the FtT so  that  further
    findings of fact can be made.  We consider that to be  the  appropriate
    course.  Although the appellant has been found incredible  in  relation
    to his account of first-hand difficulties with ISIL,  it  was  accepted
    that he is a Kurd from Tuz Khurmato  which  is,  as  we  have  recorded
    above,  an  area  with  particular  ethno-sectarian  conflict.   It  is
    arguable (we put it no higher than that) that the appellant might, as a
    result  of  his  particular  profile,  demonstrate  that   he   has   a
    sufficiently enhanced risk profile that he is entitled to a  conclusion
    that his return to Tuz Khurmato would engage  Article  15(c)  and  that
    considerations of internal relocation arise.  We could potentially have
    resolved those questions ourselves but we received no specific argument
    on the points.  That is not a criticism of the appellant's legal  team;
    as Mr  Knafler  noted  in  his  submissions,  he  was  unable  to  make
    submissions on the assessment of risk  before  he  knew  how  we  would
    decide the CG issues.

437. Nor do we consider that we have the  findings  necessary  in  order  to
    resolve the appellant's Article 3 ECHR claim satisfactorily.  As in the
    case of the first appellant, the judge  of  the  FtT  stated  that  the
    appellant's CSID was 'possibly' at the family  home  in  Tuz  Khurmato.
    That does not represent a satisfactory resolution of such an  important
    issue.  Nor, with respect to the judge,  did  he  proceed  to  consider
    whether the appellant either has or has access to the documents or  the
    information he would require in order to obtain a replacement  document
    from within the United Kingdom or on return to Iraq.  As will be  clear
    from our conclusions, these  matters  are  absolutely  central  to  the
    appellant's  ability  to  survive  upon  return  to  Iraq,  since   any
    replacement identity document would have to be obtained from his  local
    CSA office and he would not be able to reach  that  office  without  an
    identity document: [369] above refers.

438. As with the first appeal,  the  resolution  of  these  issues  requires
    further oral evidence to be taken from the appellant.  We are not in  a
    position simply to  resolve  matters  on  the  basis  of  the  findings
    previously made.   In  those  circumstances,  we  accept  Mr  Knafler's
    submission that the appropriate course is to remit the appeals  to  the
    FtT, with the primary findings of fact on  the  appellant's  protection
    claim intact.

439. The Third Appellant - IM. This appeal  has  a  complicated  history,  a
    summary of which appears at the start of this decision.  The  appellant
    is a Sunni Kurd from Mosul who entered the UK in the year 2000 when  he
    was 13 years old.  He was granted ILR in 2008.   He  then  committed  a
    series of serious drug offences and a deportation  decision  was  made.
    The appellant appealed to the FtT and his appeal was dismissed by First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Spencer.  The judge found that  the  appellant  had
    failed to rebut the presumptions in s72 of the Nationality, Immigration
    and Asylum Act 2002  that  he  had  committed  a  particularly  serious
    offence and that he represented a danger to the community  of  the  UK.
    He dismissed the appeal on asylum grounds on  that  basis.   The  judge
    found that the appellant would face an Article 15(c) risk in Mosul  but
    that it would not be unduly harsh, despite the  absence  of  a  support
    network there, for the appellant to relocate to Baghdad.   In  relation
    to the issue of documentation, the judge accepted  that  the  appellant
    did not have and could not hope to obtain a CSID on the particular (and
    unusual) facts of his case.


440. Permission to appeal against the decision of the  FtT  was  refused  by
    the FtT and the UT.  The appellant pursued an application for  judicial
    review under CPR 54.7A.  He was  unsuccessful  at  first  instance  but
    successful in obtaining permission from the Court of Appeal.  In  light
    of the grant of permission in  AA  (Iraq),  Sir  Stephen  Richards  was
    concerned  about  the  sustainability  of  the  Tribunal's  conclusions
    regarding the appellant's ability to survive in Iraq  without  a  CSID.
    It was then accepted, in a form of consent which was sealed  by  Master
    Bancroft-Rimmer on 19 January 2018, that the appeal should be  remitted
    to the Upper Tribunal as a result of  the  decision  of  the  Court  of
    Appeal in AA (Iraq).

441. Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was duly granted and it  was
    agreed between the parties that the decision on the appeal  was  to  be
    remade in the Upper Tribunal  on  Article  15(c)  and  Article  3  ECHR
    grounds.  The scope of that remaking exercise was  agreed  between  the
    parties in a consent order which was approved by Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    O'Connor on 28 November 2018.  It was agreed between the  parties  that
    only certain of the findings of the findings of fact made  by  the  FtT
    would be preserved.  Those findings included the absence and  inability
    to obtain a CSID and the absence of any support in Baghdad.   They  did
    not include the acceptance that the  appellant  would  be  at  risk  of
    Article 15(c) conditions in Mosul.  Nor did they  include  the  judge's
    finding - made in relation to the Refugee Convention  but  relevant  to
    his eligibility for Humanitarian Protection - that  the  appellant  had
    failed to rebut the presumptions in section 72 NIAA 2002.

442. The circumstances in this case are highly unusual  and  the  respondent
    has recognised that by granting the appellant leave to  remain  on  the
    basis that his removal would be contrary to Article  3  ECHR.   On  the
    basis of the facts found by Judge Spencer, and preserved by  the  Upper
    Tribunal consent order, there remains an arguable claim  under  Article
    15(c).  We are in no position to resolve that claim,  though,  for  two
    reasons.  Firstly, there is no preserved finding as to whether  or  not
    the appellant should be excluded  from  Humanitarian  Protection  under
    paragraph 339D of the Immigration Rules.  There were relevant  findings
    made under s72 in 2016 but those findings were not  preserved  for  the
    purposes of the Humanitarian Protection assessment and cannot,  in  any
    event, be determinative of the  question  -  three  years  later  -  of
    whether the appellant represents a danger to the community or  security
    of  the  UK,  under  paragraph  339D(iii)  of  the  Immigration  Rules.
    Secondly, whilst the judge  concluded  in  2016  that  the  appellant's
    return to Mosul would engage Article 15(c), he reached that  conclusion
    because -  and  only  because  -  AA  (Iraq)  had  concluded  that  the
    conditions there engaged Article 15(c) in the generality of cases.  The
    judge did not consider whether there are any enhanced  risk  categories
    in the appellant's case which might presently engage Article 15(c) on a
    sliding scale analysis.  In the event that such a conclusion were to be
    reached in respect of Mosul, it is appreciably clear that the appellant
    - who does not have and cannot obtain - a CSID could  not  relocate  to
    avoid such a risk.  Even if those two questions were  resolved  in  the
    appellant's favour, however, it  would  remain  to  assess  whether  he
    should be excluded from HP.   Each  aspect  of  that  enquiry  requires
    further oral evidence, in our judgment, and the proper  course  in  the
    circumstances is to order that the appeal shall be remitted to the  FtT
    for these findings to be made in light of the guidance we have  issued.




Notice of Decision

The appeals are remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for further findings  of
fact to be made in light of the revised country guidance.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs otherwise, the  appellants  are
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify them or any member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellants and to the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.

Annex A


AA (Iraq) CG [2015] UKUT 544 (IAC) guidance, as amended on appeal -
[2017] EWCA Civ 944 - and supplemented in AAH  (Iraq)  CG  [2018]  UKUT  212
(IAC)

    A. INDISCRIMINATE VIOLENCE IN IRAQ: ARTICLE 15(C) OF THE  QUALIFICATION
        DIRECTIVE
    1.   There is at present a state of internal armed conflict in  certain
        parts of Iraq, involving government  security  forces,  militias  of
        various kinds, and the Islamist group known as ISIL.  The  intensity
        of  this  armed  conflict  in  the  so-called   "contested   areas",
        comprising the governorates of Anbar, Diyala, Kirkuk, (aka  Ta'min),
        Ninewah and Salah Al-din, is such that, as a general  matter,  there
        are substantial grounds for believing  that  any  civilian  returned
        there, solely on account of his or her presence there, faces a  real
        risk of being subjected  to  indiscriminate  violence  amounting  to
        serious harm within the scope of Article 15(c) of the  Qualification
        Directive.


    2.   The degree of armed conflict in  certain  parts  of  the  "Baghdad
        Belts" (the urban environs around  Baghdad  City)  is  also  of  the
        intensity described in paragraph 1 above, thereby giving rise  to  a
        generalised Article 15(c) risk.  The  parts  of  the  Baghdad  Belts
        concerned  are  those  forming  the  border  between   the   Baghdad
        Governorate and the contested areas described in paragraph 1.

    3.   The degree of armed conflict in the remainder of  Iraq  (including
        Baghdad City) is not such as to give rise to indiscriminate violence
        amounting to such serious harm to civilians, irrespective  of  their
        individual characteristics, so as to engage Article 15(c).

    4.   In accordance with the principles set out in  Elgafaji  (C-465/07)
        and QD (Iraq) v Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  [2009]
        EWCA Civ 620, decision-makers  in  Iraqi  cases  should  assess  the
        individual  characteristics  of  the  person  claiming  humanitarian
        protection, in order to ascertain whether those characteristics  are
        such as to put that person at real risk of Article 15(c) harm.

    B.   DOCUMENTATION AND FEASIBILITY OF RETURN (EXCLUDING IKR)
    5.   Return of former residents of the Iraqi Kurdish Region (IKR)  will
        be to the IKR and all other Iraqis will be  to  Baghdad.  The  Iraqi
        authorities will allow an Iraqi national (P) in the  United  Kingdom
        to enter Iraq only if P is in possession of  a  current  or  expired
        Iraqi passport relating to P, or a Laissez passer.

    6.   No Iraqi  national  will  be  returnable  to  Baghdad  if  not  in
        possession of one of these documents.

    7.   In the light of the Court of Appeal's judgment in  HF  (Iraq)  and
        Others v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2013] EWCA  Civ
        1276, an international protection claim made by P cannot succeed  by
        reference to any alleged risk of harm arising from an absence  of  a
        current or expired Iraqi  passport  or  a  Laissez  passer,  if  the
        Tribunal finds that P's return is not currently feasible on  account
        of a lack of any of those documents.

    8.   Where P is returned  to  Iraq  on  a  Laissez  Passer  or  expired
        passport, P will be at no risk of  serious  harm  at  the  point  of
        return by reason of not having a current passport.

    C.   THE CSID
    9. Whilst it remains possible for an Iraqi  national  returnee  (P)  to
       obtain a new CSID whether P is able to do so,  or  do  so  within  a
       reasonable time frame, will depend on the individual  circumstances.
       Factors to be considered include:

        i) Whether P has any other form of  documentation,  or  information
           about the location of his entry in the civil register.  An  INC,
           passport, birth/marriage certificates or an expired  CSID  would
           all be of substantial assistance. For someone in  possession  of
           one  or  more  of  these  documents  the   process   should   be
           straightforward. A Laissez-Passer  should  not  be  counted  for
           these purposes: these can be issued without any other form of ID
           being available, are not of any assistance in 'tracing back'  to
           the family record and are confiscated upon arrival at Baghdad;


       ii) The location of the relevant civil registry office. If it is  in
           an area held, or formerly held, by ISIL, is it operational?


      iii) Are there male family members who would be able and  willing  to
           attend the civil registry  with  P?   Because  the  registration
           system is patrilineal it will be relevant  to  consider  whether
           the relative is from the mother or  father's  side.  A  maternal
           uncle in possession of his CSID  would  be  able  to  assist  in
           locating the original place of registration of the  individual's
           mother, and from there the trail would need to  be  followed  to
           the place that her records were transferred  upon  marriage.  It
           must also be borne in mind that a significant number of IDPs  in
           Iraq are themselves undocumented; if that  is  the  case  it  is
           unlikely that they could be of assistance.  A  woman  without  a
           male relative to assist  with  the  process  of  redocumentation
           would face very significant  obstacles  in  that  officials  may
           refuse to deal with her case at all.

    D.    INTERNAL RELOCATION WITHIN IRAQ (OTHER THAN THE IKR)
    10.  As a general matter, it will not be unreasonable or  unduly  harsh
        for a person from a contested area to relocate to  Baghdad  City  or
        (subject to paragraph 2 above) the Baghdad Belts.
    11.  In assessing whether it would be unreasonable/unduly harsh  for  P
        to relocate to Baghdad, the following factors are,  however,  likely
        to be relevant:
        (a)   whether P has a CSID or will be able to obtain one (see Part C
           above);
        (b)   whether P can speak Arabic (those who cannot are  less  likely
           to find employment);
        (c)   whether P has family members or friends  in  Baghdad  able  to
           accommodate him;
        (d)   whether P is a lone female (women  face  greater  difficulties
           than men in finding employment);
        (e)   whether P can find a sponsor to access a hotel  room  or  rent
           accommodation;
        (f)   whether P is from a minority community;
        (g)   whether there is support available for P bearing in mind there
           is  some  evidence  that  returned  failed  asylum  seekers  are
           provided with the support generally given to IDPs.


    12.  There is not a real risk of an ordinary civilian  travelling  from
        Baghdad airport to the southern governorates, suffering serious harm
        en route to such governorates so as engage Article 15(c).

    E.   IRAQI KURDISH REGION
    13. There are currently no international flights to  the  Iraqi  Kurdish
        Region (IKR). All returns from the United Kingdom are to Baghdad.
    14. For an Iraqi national returnee (P) of Kurdish origin  in  possession
        of a valid CSID or Iraqi passport, the journey from Baghdad  to  the
        IKR, whether by air or land, is affordable and practical and can  be
        made without a real risk of P suffering persecution,  serious  harm,
        Article 3 ill treatment nor would any difficulties  on  the  journey
        make relocation unduly harsh.


    15. P is unable to board a domestic flight between Baghdad and  the  IKR
        without either a CSID or a valid passport.

    16. P will face considerable difficulty in making  the  journey  between
        Baghdad and the IKR by land without a CSID or valid passport.  There
        are numerous checkpoints en route, including two checkpoints in  the
        immediate vicinity of the airport.  If P has neither a  CSID  nor  a
        valid passport there is a  real  risk  of  P  being  detained  at  a
        checkpoint until such time as the security  personnel  are  able  to
        verify P's identity.  It is not reasonable to require  P  to  travel
        between Baghdad and IKR by land absent the ability of  P  to  verify
        his identity at a checkpoint. This normally requires the  attendance
        of a male family member and production of P's identity documents but
        may also be achieved by calling upon "connections" higher up in  the
        chain of command.

    17. Once at the IKR border (land or air) P  would  normally  be  granted
        entry  to  the  territory.  Subject  to  security   screening,   and
        registering presence with the local mukhtar, P would be permitted to
        enter and reside in the IKR with no  further  legal  impediments  or
        requirements. There is no sponsorship requirement for Kurds.

    18. Whether P would be at particular risk of  ill-treatment  during  the
        security screening process must be assessed on a case-by-case basis.
        Additional factors that may increase risk include: (i) coming from a
        family with a known association with ISIL, (ii) coming from an  area
        associated with ISIL and (iii) being a single male of fighting  age.
        P is likely to be able to evidence the fact of recent  arrival  from
        the UK, which would dispel any suggestion of having arrived directly
        from ISIL territory.

    19. If P has family members living  in  the  IKR  cultural  norms  would
        require that family to accommodate P. In such circumstances P would,
        in general, have sufficient assistance from the family so as to lead
        a 'relatively normal life', which would not be unduly harsh.  It  is
        nevertheless important for decision-makers to determine  the  extent
        of any assistance likely to be provided by P's family on a  case  by
        case basis.

    20.  For  those  without  the  assistance  of  family  in  the  IKR  the
        accommodation options are limited:

          . Absent special circumstances it is not reasonably likely that P
            will be able to gain access to one of the refugee camps in  the
            IKR; these camps are  already  extremely  overcrowded  and  are
            closed to newcomers. 64% of IDPs are  accommodated  in  private
            settings with the vast majority living with family members;


          . If P cannot live with a family member, apartments in  a  modern
            block in a new neighbourhood are available for rent at  a  cost
            of between $300 and $400 per month;


          . P could resort to a 'critical shelter arrangement',  living  in
            an unfinished or abandoned structure, makeshift shelter,  tent,
            mosque, church or squatting in a government building.  It would
            be unduly harsh to require P to relocate to the IKR if  P  will
            live in a critical housing  shelter  without  access  to  basic
            necessities such as food, clean water and clothing;


          . In  considering  whether  P  would  be  able  to  access  basic
            necessities, account must be taken  of  the  fact  that  failed
            asylum seekers are entitled to apply  for  a  grant  under  the
            Voluntary Returns Scheme, which could give P access  to  �1500.
            Consideration should also be given  to  whether  P  can  obtain
            financial support from other sources such  as  (a)  employment,
            (b) remittances from relatives abroad, (c) the availability  of
            ad hoc charity or by being able to access PDS rations.

    21. Whether P is able to secure employment must be assessed on a case-by-
        case basis taking the following matters into account:


          . Gender. Lone women are very  unlikely  to  be  able  to  secure
            legitimate employment;


          . The unemployment rate for Iraqi IDPs living in the IKR is 70%;


          . P cannot work without a CSID;


          . Patronage and nepotism continue  to  be  important  factors  in
            securing employment. A returnee with family connections to  the
            region will have a  significant  advantage  in  that  he  would
            ordinarily  be  able  to  call  upon  those  contacts  to  make
            introductions to prospective employers and to vouch for him;


          . Skills, education and experience. Unskilled workers are at  the
            greatest disadvantage, with the  decline  in  the  construction
            industry reducing the number of labouring jobs available;


          . If P is from an area with a marked association with ISIL,  that
            may deter prospective employers.

    F.   EXISTING COUNTRY GUIDANCE DECISIONS
    22.  This decision replaces all existing country guidance on Iraq



   Annex B


Guidance in BA (Iraq) CG [2017] UKUT 18 (IAC)


(i)  The level of general violence in Baghdad city remains significant,  but
   the current evidence does not justify departing from the  conclusion  of
   the Tribunal in AA (Article 15(c)) Iraq CG [2015] UKUT 544 (IAC).

(ii)     The evidence shows that those who worked for  non-security  related
   Western or international companies, or any other  categories  of  people
   who would be perceived as having  collaborated  with  foreign  coalition
   forces, are still likely to be at risk in areas  which  are  under  ISIL
   control or have high levels of insurgent activity. At the  current  time
   the risk is likely to emanate from Sunni insurgent groups  who  continue
   to target Western or international companies as well as  those  who  are
   perceived to collaborate with the Government of Iraq.

(iii) The current evidence indicates that the risk in Baghdad to  those  who
   worked for non-security related Western or  international  companies  is
   low although there is evidence to show that  insurgent  groups  such  as
   ISIL are active and capable of carrying out attacks in the city.  In  so
   far as there may be a low level of risk from such groups in  Baghdad  it
   is  not  sufficient  to  show  a  real  risk  solely  as   a   perceived
   collaborator.

(iv) Kidnapping has been, and remains, a significant and persistent  problem
   contributing to the breakdown of law and order  in  Iraq.  Incidents  of
   kidnapping are likely to be underreported. Kidnappings might  be  linked
   to a political or sectarian motive;  other  kidnappings  are  rooted  in
   criminal activity for a purely financial motive. Whether a returnee from
   the West is likely to be perceived as a potential target for  kidnapping
   in Baghdad may depend on how long he or she has  been  away  from  Iraq.
   Each case will be fact sensitive, but in principle, the longer a  person
   has spent abroad the greater the risk. However, the  evidence  does  not
   show a real risk to a returnee in Baghdad on this ground alone.

(v)  Sectarian  violence  has  increased  since  the  withdrawal  of  US-led
   coalition forces in 2012, but is not at the levels seen in 2006-2007.  A
   Shia dominated government is supported by Shia militias in Baghdad.  The
   evidence indicates that Sunni men are more  likely  to  be  targeted  as
   suspected supporters of Sunni extremist groups such  as  ISIL.  However,
   Sunni identity alone is not sufficient to give rise to a  real  risk  of
   serious harm.

(vi) Individual characteristics, which do not in themselves  create  a  real
   risk of serious harm on return to Baghdad, might amount to a  real  risk
   for the  purpose  of  the  Refugee  Convention,  Article  15(c)  of  the
   Qualification Directive or Article 3  of  the  ECHR  if  assessed  on  a
   cumulative basis. The assessment will depend on the facts of each case.

(vii) In general, the authorities in Baghdad are unable, and in the case  of
   Sunni complainants, are likely to be  unwilling  to  provide  sufficient
   protection.

-----------------------
[1] A 'contested area' is to be distinguished from a  'Disputed  Territory'.
The former term relates to an area which was under the control of ISIL;  the
latter relates to an area to which the Kurdistan  Region  of  Iraq  and  the
Government of Iraq both lay claim, as  recognised  in  Article  140  of  the
Iraqi Constitution.
[2] EASO was established on 19 May  2010  under  European  Union  Regulation
439/2010.  Its stated aims are "to increase the  cooperation  of  EU  Member
States on asylum, improve the implementation of the Common  European  Asylum
System, and support Member States under pressure."
[3] There are various different ways of spelling the name of this
governorate.  We have used that which is most frequently encountered in the
background material: "Salah Al Din"
[4] The obvious differences in the figures collated by UNAMI and the IBC
has been discussed in previous cases and is helpfully explained by Dr Fatah
at [457]-[465 of his first report and at [107]-[112] of HM2.
[5] REACH is a humanitarian research initiative, founded in 2010 by Geneva-
based NGO IMPACT, the French NGO ACTED and the United Nations Operational
Satellite Applications Programme ("UNOSAT")
[6] Unfortunately, and seemingly as a result of the use of  'bundle  making'
software on the part of the appellant's  representatives,  the  graphs  were
not reproduced in the printed reports before us  and  we  were  required  to
access them online.

[10] Dr Fatah uses the abbreviations NIDC and INID in his reports.  We
prefer the latter abbreviation and will use it throughout.
