For the Appellant:     Mr S Kotas,  Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr A Pretzell instructed by Haris Ali Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS


    1.  This is an appeal against a  decision  and  reasons  by  First-tier
       Tribunal Judge Nightingale promulgated on 25th August 2015 in  which
       she allowed an appeal against a decision made by the Entry Clearance
       Officer on 19th August 2014 refusing the appellant  leave  to  enter
       the UK as a spouse of a British Citizen.


    2. The appellant before me, is the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  and  the
       respondent to this appeal, is Mrs Rabia Bibi.  However for  ease  of
       reference, in the course of this decision I shall adopt the parties'
       status as it was before the First-tier Tribunal.  I  shall  in  this
       decision, refer to Mrs Bibi as the appellant and the Entry Clearance
       Officer as the respondent.


 Background


    3. The respondent's decision of  19th  August  2014  alleged  that  the
       information  relied  upon  by  the  appellant  in  support  of   the
       application was false.   The  appellant  claimed  that  her  sponsor
       (husband) was employed by Airport on Time Ltd at  the  time  of  the
       application for entry clearance and  indeed  had  worked  with  that
       employer since 2010.  The respondent claimed that checks carried out
       with HMRC established that HMRC have no record  of  the  appellant's
       sponsor holding any employment during the tax year 2012/13.  It  was
       also said that Companies House has no  record  of  a  company  named
       "Airport on Time".


    4. The appellant appealed and the respondent's decision to  refuse  the
       application was reviewed by an Entry Clearance Manager  taking  into
       account  all  of  the  supporting  documents  provided.   The  Entry
       Clearance Manager  maintained  that  the  appellant  provided  false
       documents and made false statements in her application and that  the
       refusal under  the  suitability  requirements  of  Appendix  FM  was
       therefore justified.


 The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Nightingale


    5. On appeal, it was uncontroversial that  the  application  for  entry
       clearance had been made on 4th July 2013 and  the  six-month  period
       prior to that application to which evidence had to be provided,  ran
       from 28th December 2012 to 28th June 2013.


    6. First-tier Tribunal Judge Nightingale heard the submissions made  on
       behalf of both parties, that are recorded at paragraphs [10] to [16]
       of her decision. Having considered the evidence and the  submissions
       made, she sets out her findings and reasons for allowing the  appeal
       at paragraphs [20] to [25] of her decision.


    7. The Judge found at  paragraph  [21]  that  the  respondent  has  not
       established on the balance of probabilities that HMRC  informed  the
       respondent that they have no  record  of  the  sponsor  holding  any
       employment during the tax year 2012/2013.  She noted,  at  paragraph
       [22] that there was no evidence before her that there is  no  record
       of any company named "Airport On time".  She found at paragraph [22]
       that the respondent had not  discharged  the  burden  of  proof,  on
       balance, to show that any false document or false representation has
       been used in the course of making the application.


    8. The Judge then turned to the immigration rules and in particular the
       requirement that the appellant and her partner are able to  maintain
       themselves adequately in the UK without recourse to public funds. To
       that end, the Judge states:


             "23. ....The sponsor needs to show that he has a gross  income
             of at least �18,600 per annum. In order to establish  that  he
             does so, he must produce the evidence specified at Appendix FM-
             SE sub-paragraph (2).   There are three  separate  heads  with
             regard to the specified evidence.  They  are,  in  short,  pay
             slips, bank statements and a letter from  the  employer.  With
             regard to the pay slips, I am satisfied that the appellant has
             produced her husband's pay slips from Airport On time  Limited
             for the six-month period prior to  this  application.  I  have
             considered Mr Dhanji's  very  helpful  arithmetic,  and  I  am
             satisfied that the  amounts  shown  on  these  pay  slips  do,
             indeed, indicate that he earned just in excess of �18,600 when
             represented as an annual figure.


             24.  However, I do find some anomalies with the amounts  shown
             on his pay slips and the amounts shown  going  into  his  bank
             account.  The bank statements must show the salary going  into
             the sponsor's account.  Largely, the bank statements  do  show
             the sponsor's salary going into his  account,  but  there  are
             some payments which are slightly less and, also, slightly more
             than the figures shown on  the  pay  slips.   Given  that  the
             sponsor works in a family business, and that his  employer  is
             his father, it may well be the case that his father  sometimes
             pays him slightly less, but later makes up the salary  with  a
             larger payment in the following week or month. Having added up
             the total amount shown going into the sponsor's  account  over
             the  requisite  period  of  time,  I  am  satisfied  that  the
             indicated salary is paid into his account albeit if not always
             in the regular amounts shown on the pay slips.   I  find  that
             the bank statements do, overall, accord with the pay slips and
             corroborate the salary."


             ...


    9. The Judge found at paragraph [25] of her decision that  the  letters
       from the sponsor's employer meet the requirements of  the  specified
       evidence.  She concluded that on the balance  of  probabilities  she
       was "satisfied that the specified documentation has been provided to
       establish that the earnings are in excess of the required �18,600.".
        The Judge found that the appellant meets the  requirements  of  the
       Immigration Rules for entry to the UK as the  spouse  of  a  British
       Citizen and allowed the appeal under the Immigration Rules.


   10. The respondent refers to the anomalies  that  were  referred  to  in
       paragraph [24] of the decision, and submits that the Judge erred  in
       finding that the  financial  requirement  is  met.   The  respondent
       submits that if there are differences between the amounts  shown  on
       the two documents (i.e. the wage slips and the bank statements)  the
       payments cannot be said  to  correspond,  and  the  requirements  of
       Appendix FM-SE, are not met.


   11. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge McDade
       on 20th December 2015.  The  matter  comes  before  me  to  consider
       whether or not the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Nightingale
       involved the making of a material error of law, and if so, to remake
       the decision.


   12. Mr Kotas submits on behalf of the  respondent  that  Appendix  FM-SE
       does not provide any discretion.  He submits that the purpose of the
       rule is to ensure that there is evidence that the earnings  received
       by an applicant are paid into the  applicant's  bank  account.   The
       earnings shown on the wage slips must therefore match  the  earnings
       credited to the applicant's bank account.  He accepts that the rules
       do not expressly require that the exact amount  shown  upon  a  wage
       slip is shown as a credit in the bank  statements,  but  he  submits
       that if there is no clear audit trail between what is  earned  by  a
       sponsor as shown in wage  slips,  and  what  is  credited  into  the
       sponsor's bank account, one is  left  with  rules  that  are  simply
       unworkable.  He submits that the rules must be strictly applied  and
       that a "near miss" in the sense that the payments into  a  sponsor's
       bank account almost match the earnings disclosed  in  the  sponsor's
       wage slips, is not good enough.


   13. I accept that the specified  evidence  required  in  support  of  an
       application is there to establish an audit  trail  between  what  is
       earned by a sponsor as shown in wage slips,  and  what  is  credited
       into the bank account.  In respect of salaried employment,  Appendix
       FM-SE requires an applicant to produce payslips, a letter  from  the
       employer and personal bank  statements  corresponding  to  the  same
       period as the payslips showing that the salary has been paid into an
       account in the name of the applicant and their partner jointly.  The
       production of those documents in support of an application  provides
       an audit trail that an applicant is employed as claimed, at a salary
       that meets the income threshold and that the payment of that  salary
       is corroborated by the payments into the bank account.  I  can  well
       understand that if an applicant were to claim to be in receipt of  a
       salary but the payments  into  the  applicant's  bank  account  were
       either in excess of the claimed salary, or below the claimed salary,
       some explanation would be called for.  A Judge might legitimately in
       such a case conclude that he or she cannot  be  satisfied  that  the
       income  shown  on  the  bank  accounts  is  that  derived  from  the
       employment claimed.


   14.  The First-tier Tribunal Judge here found at paragraph [24]  of  her
       decision:


         "24. ...Having added up the total  amount  shown  going  into  the
             sponsor's account over the requisite  period  of  time,  I  am
             satisfied that the indicated salary is paid into  his  account
             albeit if not always in the regular amounts shown on  the  pay
             slips.   I find that the bank statements do,  overall,  accord
             with the pay slips and corroborate the salary."


   15.  That is a factual finding that is not challenged by the  respondent
       and one that was plainly open to the Judge on the evidence.   In  my
       judgement, the Judge was neither suggesting that there is some  form
       of discretion, nor did she  find  that  the  income  into  the  bank
       account almost met the income requirements.  She found, having added
       up the total amount going into the sponsor's bank account  over  the
       requisite period  that  the  salary  was  paid  into  the  sponsor's
       account, albeit if not always in the regular amounts  shown  on  the
       payslips.


   16. In my judgement it was open to the Judge on the evidence before her,
       to find that on a balance of probabilities, the  specified  evidence
       has been provided to establish that the earnings are  in  excess  of
       the required �18,600.


   17. It follows that in  my  judgment,  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
       Tribunal discloses no  material  error  of  law  and  the  appeal  is
       dismissed.
