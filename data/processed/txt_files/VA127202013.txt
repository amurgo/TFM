Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mrs Mitzi Stephenson-Golding
For the Respondent:    Mr P Duffy, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Jamaica whose appeal  to  be  allowed  to
    visit his aunt was allowed by First-tier Tribunal Judge Napthine  in  a
    determination promulgated on 10th March 2014.  Grounds  of  application
    were  lodged  on  the  basis  that  the  judge  had  made  a   material
    misdirection in law.  It  was  noted  in  the  determination  that  the
    Presenting Officer conceded that the Appellant had a  right  of  appeal
    because he was visiting his aunt (paragraph 10). However the  Appellant
    made his application on 6th May 2013 and the Regulations in  force  at
    that time were the Immigration  Appeals  (Family  Visitor)  Regulations
    2012 which came into force on 9th July 2012 and do not  include  "aunt"
    as a qualifying relative.

 2. As noted in the grounds, appeal rights are established by  statute  and
    therefore cannot be conceded where no such right exists.   As  such  it
    was said that the judge had no jurisdiction to hear the case and  allow
    the appeal.

 3. Permission to appeal was  granted  by  Designated  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge McCarthy who noted that the Immigration Appeals (Family  Visitor)
    Regulations 2012 (SI 2012/1532) in force from 9th  July  2012  applied.
    As he put it a person only has a right of  appeal  against  refusal  of
    entry clearance as a visitor if they are visiting a person  related  in
    one  of  the  ways  specified  in  those  Regulations.   The  list   of
    relationships does not include nephew to aunt and it was clear that the
    Presenting Officer had misled the judge into thinking otherwise.

 4. Thus the appeal came before me on the above date.

Submissions

 5. Mr Duffy for the Home Office relied on  the  grounds.   The  Rules  had
    changed on 9th July 2012 and this application was dated 6th May  2013.
    As such the rights of appeal to a judge were very limited  and  despite
    the concession by the  Presenting  Officer  judges  were  creatures  of
    statute and the concession was wrongly made.  I was therefore asked to
    find that there was a material error in law, set aside the decision and
    in remaking it dismiss the appeal.

 6. The Sponsor appeared and relied on the decision made by the judge.   It
    had been accepted that the Appellant had a right of appeal  because  he
    was visiting his aunt.  The Entry Clearance Manager  had  reviewed  the
    application and said  there  were  full  appeal  rights  for  a  family
    visitor.

 7. I reserved my decision.

Conclusions

 8. There is no dispute that the Appellant applied for entry clearance as a
    visitor on 6th May 2013, the date of refusal by  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer being 3rd June 2013.

 9. The Sponsor was quite right to say that the Entry Clearance Manager had
    reviewed the position and stated that the application was made prior to
    the withdrawal of full appeal rights for family visitors; and also that
    Counsel for the Home Office had said the same to the judge.  However it
    was not disputed before me, nor could it be, that that is not the case.
     Clearly the Rules that were in place from 9th July  2012  applied  and
    the list of relationships does not include nephew to aunt.  As such the
    concession made to the judge was wrongly made  and  a  concession  made
    against the terms of statute is wrong in law.

10. It follows from this that the judge made a material  error  of  law  in
    allowing the appeal as it was not open to him to do so in terms of  the
    Regulations.  I am therefore obliged to set the decision aside and make
    a fresh decision dismissing the appeal.

11. The remedy for the Appellant, given that the judge found  he  satisfied
    the requirements of paragraph 41, is to lodge a fresh  application  and
    he can point to the fact that Judge Napthine was satisfied that he  met
    all the requirements of paragraph 41.

Decision

12. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.

13. I set aside the decision.

14. I remake the decision in the appeal by dismissing it.
