For the Respondent:    Mr T Bahja, Solicitor, instructed by Jesus
Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   Although the Secretary of State  is  the  appellant  before  the  Upper
    Tribunal, I shall continue to refer to Mr Rowe as the appellant herein.



2.   The appellant is a citizen of Jamaica, born on 14  July  1979.  He  was
    convicted on 11 October 2013 at St Albans Crown  Court  for  possession
    and producing a controlled Class B drug and sentence to two and a  half
    years imprisonment.  In light of his conviction, he was served  with  a
    Notice of Liability to Automatic  Deportation  action  on  27  November
    2013.  He duly responded to the notice by stating that removal from the
    United Kingdom would breach his Human Rights as he has a child and wife
    in the United Kingdom.  On 19 June 2014 a deportation order was made by
    virtue of Section 32(5) of the UK of Borders Act 2007.  The appellant's
    appeal against the deportation order was allowed by First-tier Tribunal
    Judge Bart-Stewart on Article 8 grounds.

3.   The appellant was convicted with one other after a three day trial  for
    producing cannabis in a three bedroom house in Hatfield, Hertford.  The
    trial judge considered that the operation was relatively  sophisticated
    and established to  produce  significant  quantities  of  cannabis  for
    commercial supply.  The appellant and his co-defendant had keys to  the
    property and the locked stores within the property and paraphernalia in
    their possession associated with the production of cannabis,  including
    lighting, work  gloves,  secateurs  and  �600  in  cash  received.  The
    appellant  and  his  co-defendant  were  not  considered  managers   or
    organisers, but trusted employees. Neither lived nearby and they had to
    commute some distance to fulfil their role.  Both were of previous good
    character and produced references.  The trial judge considered that the
    operation fell some  way  short  of  properly  being  characterised  as
    industrial scale cultivation of cannabis and put it towards  the  lower
    end of that category. The trial judge was satisfied that what was  done
    was for  commercial  gain  and  that  only  a  custodial  sentence  was
    justified. The appellant  was  sentenced  to  two  and  a  half  years'
    imprisonment.

4.   The appellant entered the United Kingdom as a visitor  on  24  November
    2000.  He was given six months leave to enter.  He subsequently claimed
    asylum which was refused and an appeal against that  was  unsuccessful.
    His appeal rights became exhausted on 5 February 2002.   He  was  given
    temporary admission and required to report which he failed to do.  On 7
    September 2002 he married AR.  He  was  removed  as  an  overstayer  to
    Jamaica on 18 February 2003.  He obtained entry clearance  to  re-enter
    the UK as a spouse following an appeal.  Entry  clearance  was  granted
    from 16 May 2003 until 15 May 2005.  He re-entered the  UK  on  3  June
    2003.  He was granted indefinite leave to remain in the UK on  28  June
    2005.  His daughter, S, with his wife was born on 30 July 2010.

5.   The evidence before the judge in the form of letters from  West  London
    Mental Health NHS Trust indicated that AR has a long history of OCD and
    an eating disorder.  Her  daily  functioning  is  grossly  affected  by
    obsessions and disassociated compulsions predominantly in cleaning  and
    checking domains and by unhealthy and unusual eating patterns.  Her OCD
    has been manifest since her teenage years, is  profoundly  debilitating
    and renders her unable to work.  She was  receiving  support  from  the
    local authority with regard to the care of her child and was under  the
    care of a consultant psychiatrist as well  as  the  Trust's  psychology
    service. The judge also had before her the local authority's Child  and
    Family Assessment completed on 14 April  2014.   The  report  had  been
    produced at the request of the  UKBA  on  the  impact  the  appellant's
    potential deportation would have on S, his involvement with  the  child
    and to explore her current care arrangements.  The report referred to a
    referral in April 2013 from the GP and the appellant's partner who were
    requesting support during the ongoing situation  following  his  arrest
    and her health concerns.  The case was allocated to the localities team
    who still remain actively involved.

6.   The  judge  noted  that  the  Secretary  of  State  accepted  that  the
    appellant has established a private and family life in the UK.  He  has
    a wife with whom he has been in a relationship for fourteen  years  and
    has a long marriage.  They also have a child. They lived together prior
    to his imprisonment and on his release from prison in January  2015  it
    is anticipated that if not deported, he would return to live  with  his
    family.  The judge found by virtue of Section 117D of the  Nationality,
    Immigration and  Asylum  Act  2002  that  the  appellant's  wife  is  a
    qualifying partner and the child is a  qualifying  child  as  both  are
    British citizens.

7.   The judge had regard to MF (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA  Civ  1192,  in  which
    the Court of Appeal accepted that  in  the  balancing  exercise,  great
    weight should be given to the  public  interest  in  deporting  foreign
    criminals who do not satisfy paragraphs 398, 399 or 399A.  It  is  only
    exceptionally that such foreign criminals will succeed in showing  that
    their rights under Article 8(1) trump  the  public  interest  in  their
    deportation.  A two stage test is to be carried out.

8.   The judge found in  respect  of  the  appellant  that  under  paragraph
    398(b) prima facie, deportation is conducive  to  the  public  interest
    because he was convicted of an offence for which he was sentenced to  a
    period of imprisonment of less than four  years  but  at  least  twelve
    months.   She  also  found  that  paragraph  399  applies  because  the
    Secretary of State conceded  that  he  had  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    parental relationship with his child, who is a  British  citizen.   She
    found that paragraph 399A does not apply.

9.   The judge considered section 117B. She found that the appellant  speaks
    English and it would appear that  for  most  part  he  was  financially
    independent as until 2011  he  ran  his  own  painting  and  decorating
    company.  Although he  formed  his  relationship  with  his  qualifying
    partner when he was in the UK unlawfully and his immigration status was
    precarious, he left the UK and regularised his stay.  His private  life
    was established after returning  to  the  UK  with  the  correct  entry
    clearance.

10.  The judge then considered the appellant's offence,  the  trial  judge's
    sentencing  remarks  and  the  sentence  of  two  and  a  half   years'
    imprisonment which indicated that the trial judge considered this to be
    a serious offence and the  appellant's  role  within  it  was  serious.
    However, because the period of imprisonment was less  than  four  years
    she accepted it as not "the" most serious of offences.

11.  The judge found that Exception 1 of section 117C(4) does not  apply  as
    the appellant has been in the UK for fourteen years and has  only  been
    lawfully resident for ten years and five months,  taking  into  account
    the period of imprisonment.

12.  The judge then went on to  consider  whether  Exception  2  of  section
    117C(5) applies.  This is where a foreign criminal has  a  genuine  and
    subsisting relationship with a qualifying partner or a qualifying child
    and the effect of the foreign criminal's deportation on the partner  or
    child would be unduly harsh.  In the light of  the  appellant's  wife's
    eating disorder and the OCD, the judge  found  that  it  would  not  be
    reasonable to expect the wife to relocate to Jamaica.

13.  The judge considered whether  the  deportation,  which  would  lead  to
    separation in light of her above finding, would be  unduly  harsh.   In
    considering this issue the judge had regard to  the  report  by  social
    services which recorded that the appellant has played a strong part his
    daughter's day-to-day life since her birth.   The report described  the
    appellant's wife's appearing to manage the  day-to-day tasks of meeting
    the daughter's needs appropriately but that she has a  lot  of  support
    from the maternal grandmother.   Reference  was  made  to  the  child's
    grandmother's diagnosis of terminal cancer and her ability  to  provide
    long term care. The  report  said  it  was  evident  from  the  child's
    behaviour that she missed her father greatly and was anxious for him to
    return home.

14.  The judge stated at paragraph 44:

             In making an analysis of the implications of  the  information
         obtained for the child's future safety, health and development, the
         social worker states, "The result of deportation can result in  S's
         feeling of abandonment as well as a negative impact on her sense of
         identity and her right to family life". Such feelings can  underlie
         much of the emotional and behavioural problems that can develop  in
         childhood and into adulthood.  She continues:-

             "I feel that there is currently no concern no concern in  AR's
         ability to care for S with the assistance of Miss I who  had  taken
         over the role from Mr. Rowe.  It is important however to note  that
         Miss I is suffering  from  a  terminal  illness  that  should  this
         support fall away from AR and S and Mr. Rowe has  not  returned  to
         the family home, then there will be a potential concern for  AR  to
         meet the needs of S.  I feel that a potential  deportation  of  Mr.
         Rowe would have a negative effect on S and  her  ongoing  emotional
         and behavioural development as well as AR's  ability  to  meet  S's
         long term needs due to her own issues.

             Further it is important to note that due to the nature  of  Mr
         Rowe's health issues it is  not  possible  for  her  to  reside  in
         Jamaica as she would not be  able  to  access  the  same  level  of
         treatment that she is currently engaging within the UK.   Therefore
         a possible deportation would mean a permanent splitting up of  this
         family with potential negative impact on S's  ongoing  development,
         self-esteem and identity.  ...Should  Mr.  Rowe  be  deported  then
         family services may need to become involved and explore measures to
         be put in place to safeguard S and support AR".

15.  The judge concluded as follows at paragraph 45

         "Taking  all  those  matters  into  account,  in   particular   the
         appellant's  partner's  medical  condition  which  is   not   fully
         controlled, the fact that her ability to cope with S in the absence
         of the appellant is very much dependent on her  mother  who  has  a
         terminal illness and may not be able to assist in  the  long  term,
         the burden of supporting the appellant's  partner  and  child  will
         fall on social services and lead to potential  further  behavioural
         problems by the child. I find that it would be unduly harsh for the
         claimant to be deported.

16.  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Landes  granted  the  Secretary  of  State
    permission to appeal the judge's decision on the basis it  is  arguable
    that the judge did not give adequate reasons for  her  conclusion  that
    the effect of deportation on the  appellant's  partner/child  would  be
    unduly harsh; there was some contradiction between the judge's findings
    at paragraph 35 that the appellant's wife was able to  care  for  their
    daughter given the limited evidence of  the  appellant  being  a  major
    presence in his daughter's life and her ultimate conclusions; the judge
    was speculating as to  what  might  happen  in  the  future  given  the
    appellant's mother-in-law's  medical  condition.   First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Landes noted the Secretary of State's argument that the  Tribunal
    approached the appeal from a neutral  starting  point  instead  of  one
    heavily weighted in favour of deportation, but that the judge purported
    to apply the statutory  exceptions.   He  made  the  comment  that  the
    statutory exceptions themselves weight the balance strongly  in  favour
    of deportation and it was not obvious  that  a  judge  needed  to  give
    additional consideration to the public interest.

17.  Mr Avery submitted that the issue in this case is the judge's  approach
    to Exception 2 in section 117C.  Their challenge is the lack of reasons
    the judge gave for  reaching  her  conclusions  at  paragraph  45.   He
    submitted that there are two parts to the unduly harsh test.  The first
    is that it is a high test. It is not sufficient to show the detrimental
    effect the deportation will have on the family.  He accepted that there
    will be an adverse impact on the family but there was  nothing  in  the
    evidence that was close to meeting the unduly harsh  test.    The  word
    "unduly" must be assessed in the round with all other factors.

18.  Mr Avery submitted that in considering section 117C the  judge  had  to
    take into account the public interest in removing  the  appellant.   He
    relied on SS (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ 550 where it was held that where
    the public interest is set out in the Immigration  Rules,  considerable
    weight has to be given to it.  Mr. Avery submitted that the  judge  did
    not do this.  He said that much of the determination  is  good  but  it
    falls down when considering the unduly harsh test.  He  submitted  that
    paragraphs 40 to 44 contained most of what was in the  social  services
    report.  There was no reference to case law and no real  assessment  of
    the public interest.

19.  Mr Bajha submitted that the judge at paragraph 32 set out s.117D  which
    defines a qualifying child and a qualifying partner.  At  paragraph  33
    she cited MF (Nigeria). He submitted that the judge  had  in  mind  the
    public interest when she assessed the unduly  harsh  test.   The  judge
    found that the appellant had been married for fourteen years.  He had a
    genuine and subsisting marriage.  The couple had  a  child  who  was  3
    years old and the appellant was involved  in  the  child's  life.   Mr.
    Bajha submitted that looked at in the round, there was no contradiction
    between the judge's findings at paragraph 35 and her ultimate findings.
     He submitted that the judge's findings from paragraph 28 to  paragraph
    45 were perfectly sound.   There was no need for the judge to  rehearse
    all the case law.

20.  Mr Avery in reply submitted  that  paragraph  39  is  where  the  judge
    considered the unduly harsh test.  Her conclusions at paragraph  45  do
    not mention the public interest.  He submitted that the seriousness  of
    the crime has to be weighed in the balance but  there  was  nothing  to
    show that the judge considered the public interest in her  conclusions.



21.  Following consideration of the arguments, I found that the  judge  made
    an error of law.  The judge's references to paragraphs 398(b), 399  and
    399A and her findings at paragraph 35 were in respect of the Rules that
    were in place in July 2012.  Those rules referred to deportation  being
    "conducive to the public good".  Those rules were amended  on  28  July
    2014 with the insertion of "public interest" in addition to the "public
    good".  The "remaining provisos" of paragraph 399  were  replaced  with
    the provisos "it would be unduly harsh for the child  to  live  in  the
    country to which the person is to be deported"; and "it would be unduly
    harsh for the child to remain in the UK without the person who is to be
    deported".  The same considerations apply to the partner. I  find  that
    it was as a result of her consideration of the  old  Immigration  Rules
    that the judge failed to consider the public interest in deporting  the
    appellant.  I appreciate that the respondent's decision was made on  19
    June 2014.  However, by virtue of paragraph  A362  of  the  Immigration
    Rules, the judge was required to consider the rules as at 28 July  2014
    because Article 8 was raised in the context of a deportation order.   I
    find that although the judge cited MF (Nigeria), she did not apply  the
    principle that in the balancing exercise, great weight should be  given
    to the public interest  in  deporting  foreign  criminals  who  do  not
    satisfy paragraphs 398, 399 or 399A.

22.  Having found there was an error of law, I heard  submissions  from  the
    parties.

23.  Mr Avery accepted that the findings of fact made by  the  judge  should
    stand.

24.  Mr Bahja submitted that the public interest comes first  and  it  is  a
    weighty matter.  Against the public interest are weighty factors.   The
    appellant has been in a genuine and subsisting marriage with  his  wife
    for fourteen years.  He has a 4 year old child who  is  British  and  a
    qualifying child.  The judge found, as did the Secretary of State, that
    the child being British is  not  reasonably  expected  to  relocate  to
    Jamaica.  The appellant was of previous good character and is therefore
    unlikely to reoffend.  He asked me to attach great weight to the social
    services report which he said was prepared at  the  insistence  of  the
    Home Office.   The appellant was given two and a  half  years  for  the
    offence committed by him and Exception 2 of paragraph 117C applies.  In
    balancing the public interest against the weighty factors  outlined  by
    him, he submitted that it would not be in the public interest to deport
    the claimant.

25.  Mr Avery submitted that I have to assess the nature of  the  claimant's
    offence, the commercial production of  cannabis  and  damaging  effects
    from a social point of view,  that should be  the  starting  point  and
    then to make an unduly harsh assessment.  It is  not  simply  the  case
    that the appellant has to show that the interference of his family  and
    private life will be affected by his deportation.   The  test  is  more
    specific.  It has to be unduly harsh in relation to all  the  evidence.
    The impact of the appellant's deportation through the assessment of the
    social  services  report  is  what  you  would  get  as  a  result   of
    deportation.  That is the nature of  deportation.  Those  factors  come
    nowhere near making it unduly harsh particularly considered the serious
    nature of the offence.

26.  He submitted that the appellant's immigration history is not  spotless.
    He overstayed his first visit.  The crime he got involved  in  involved
    considerable effort  and  a  period  of  time.   It  was  considered  a
    deliberate action on the  part  of  the  claimant.   The  Secretary  of
    State's says that the unduly harsh test has not been met.

27.  In reply Mr Bahja said that the appellant overstayed for a  short  time
    when he was here in 2001.  He returned voluntarily to Jamaica and  came
    back with entry clearance as a spouse.  That evidence should not  count
    against him.

The Law

28.  Section 117C(1) states that the deportation of foreign criminals is  in
    the public interest.  Section  117C(2)  states  the  more  serious  the
    offence committed by the foreign criminal, the greater  is  the  public
    interest in deportation of the criminal.

         Section 117C(3) states

             In the case of a foreign  criminal  ("C")  who  has  not  been
             sentenced to a period of imprisonment of four years  or  more,
             the public interest requires C's deportation unless  Exception
             1 or Exception 2 applies.

         Section 117C(5) states:

             Exception 2 applies where  C  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting
             relationship with a  qualifying  partner,  or  a  genuine  and
             subsisting parental relationship with a qualifying child,  and
             the effect of C's deportation on the partner or child would be
             unduly harsh.

29.  The appellant's wife and child  are  British  nationals.  It  has  been
    accepted by the Secretary of State that the appellant has a genuine and
    subsisting relationship  with  his  wife  and  child.   The  applicable
    immigration rule in respect of the child is paragraph  399(a)(ii)(a)  -
    whether it would be unduly harsh for the child to live in  the  country
    to which the appellant is to be deported; and (b) it would  not  unduly
    harsh for the child to remain in the UK  without  the  appellant.   The
    corresponding rule in respect of the partner is 399(b)(ii)  whether  it
    would be unduly harsh for that partner to live in the country to  which
    the appellant is to be deported, because  of  compelling  circumstances
    over and above those described in paragraph EX.2 of  Appendix  FM;  and
    (iii) it would be unduly harsh for that partner to  remain  in  the  UK
    without the appellant.

30.  The judge found that Exception 1 of  section  117C(4)  does  not  apply
    because the appellant has not been lawfully resident in the UK for most
    of his life.   The  respondent  has  accepted  that  it  would  not  be
    reasonable to expect S to leave the UK as her best interests are served
    by her remaining in the UK in  the  care  of  her  mother.   The  judge
    accepted that the appellant's wife is  a  qualifying  partner  and  the
    child is a qualifying child by virtue of paragraph 117D.

31.  The question is does  Exception  2  apply  and  if  it  does,  does  it
    outweigh the public interest in the deportation of the appellant.

32.  The appellant is liable to automatic deportation  under  section  32(5)
    of the UK Borders Act 2007 and by virtue of the Immigration  Rules  his
    deportation is in the public interest in the light  of  his  conviction
    for an offence for which he given two and a  half  years  imprisonment.
    The appellant was convicted for his part in the production of cannabis.
     Whilst the trial judge was of the view that it fell well short or some
    way  short  of  properly  being  characterised  as   industrial   scale
    cultivation of cannabis, he put this towards  the  lower  end  of  that
    category.   Nevertheless the trial judge considered the offence serious
    enough to impose an immediate custodial sentence on the appellant.

33.  Mr Bahja said that the appellant  was  previously  of  good  behaviour,
    which I accept. The appellant said he was a painter and decorator.  The
    judge accepted that for the most part  the  appellant  was  financially
    independent as until 2011  he  ran  his  own  painting  and  decorating
    company.  He claimed at the hearing below that at the time he committed
    the offence, his painting and decorating business was  not  doing  well
    and he was asked to help in someone's cannabis garden on the promise of
    a good financial reward. He now regrets this. He is classified as a low
    risk offender. The claimant said to the judge that it would  be  harsh,
    unconscionable and disproportionate to force him to be  separated  from
    his family. I find however that he had no thought at the  time  of  the
    effect his illegal activity would have on his wife and  daughter.    He
    had a legitimate means of making money but chose during the  down  turn
    to deliberately engage in an offence which has a devastating impact  on
    those who use cannabis. The judge  accepted  the  appellant's  evidence
    that he has a business network that he can access  on  his  release  in
    order to secure work to be able  to  provide  for  his  family  and  to
    prevent a relapse into the criminal justice system.  That  may  be  the
    case, but it is a pity that he did not resort to this business  network
    in order to prevent him from committing the criminal offence.

34.  The appellant claimed he had been classified as a  low  risk  offender.
    However, in the pre-sentence  report  dated  10  October  2013  he  was
    assessed as posing a medium risk of serious harm to the general  public
    through the production of more Class B drugs.  This was because of  the
    significant  amount  of  cannabis  that  was  being  produced  and  the
    potential harm to the public was significant. The report said  that  in
    order to address this risk, the appellant needed to demonstrate that he
    accepts  responsibility  for  his  offences,  address   his   financial
    circumstances but also improve his  decision-making  and  the  thinking
    skills that he appears to have used  for  criminal  gain  and  in  full
    knowledge of the potential harm drugs cause the community. There was no
    evidence before me to  show  that  the  appellant  has  undertaken  any
    courses whilst in prison to address  the  issues  raised  in  the  pre-
    sentence report.

35.  I now consider whether Exception 2 of section 117C(5) applies  in  this
    case.

36.  The appellant has been in the UK for fourteen years, but  he  has  only
    been lawfully resident in the UK for ten years and five months,  taking
    into account the period of imprisonment.   He  married  is  wife  on  7
    September 2002, and this means that they have been married  for  twelve
    years.  It is accepted that they have genuine and subsisting  marriage.
    He has a daughter, S, ho was born on 30 July 2010.  S is now  4�  years
    old.  His wife and daughter are British citizens and  therefore  are  a
    qualifying partner and a qualifying child.

37.  A Child and Family Assessment was undertaken by a social worker at  the
    request of the Secretary of State.  The Assessment was to consider  the
    impact of the appellant's deportation on S.  The request  was  made  to
    Hammersmith & Fulham on 6 January 2014 following the appellant's arrest
    and imprisonment of the appellant.

38.  The Secretary of State relied on parts of this  report  in  making  her
    decision.

39.  The report noted that AR has an  ongoing  struggle  with  an  obsessive
    compulsive disorder and an undiagnosed eating disorder.    With  regard
    to her care of S, AR is said  to  have  told  Dr  Arora,  the  treating
    Consulting Psychiatrist, that due to her compulsive  behaviour  she  is
    capable of making meals for S.  This takes a long time and adds to  her
    stress levels. The report states  that  there  have  been  no  concerns
    raised about AR's basic parenting skills.  There are no indicators that
    she is not meeting the needs of S.  However she relies on  her  mother,
    Miss I for support while the appellant is in prison.  Miss I  has  been
    diagnosed with terminal cancer and  although  she  currently  plays  an
    active and supportive role with AR, the continuation of this  role  may
    not be possible.  Should Miss I's health continue to deteriorate,  then
    the level of support she is able to offer would diminish which would be
    likely to have a negative impact on her long term support.  The  report
    goes on to say that at this stage there are no ongoing indicators  that
    AR is not meeting the needs of S.   She demonstrates  the  ability  and
    insight to safeguard S and is very loving and protective of  her.   The
    appellant states that he does worry about AR and S with regard  to  the
    effect of AR's health issues. However, he states that  she  is  a  very
    loving and caring mother and he has no concerns about  her  ability  to
    safeguard S.  The social worker said she felt that there was  currently
    no concern in AR's ability to care for S with the assistance of Miss  I
    who has taken over the role from  the  appellant.   Whilst  the  social
    worker says that it is important to note that Miss I is suffering  from
    a terminal illness and should this support fall away and the  appellant
    has not returned to the family home, there will be a potential  concern
    for AR to meet the needs of S.  Nevertheless for the moment AR has been
    assessed as having the ability to care for her daughter.

40.  In respect of S, the report states that  no  health  issues  have  been
    reported in regard to S by her parents.  The information received  from
    the GP stated that there  were  no  safeguard  concerns.   The  nursery
    school which she attends also stated that they have no  concerns  about
    S''s development or behaviour.  She engages well  with  her  peers  and
    with the adult staff members at the nursery.   During  her  visits  and
    prison visits S was seen to have a warm and engaging relationship  with
    both parents.  She has a very  close  relationship  with  her  maternal
    grandmother, Miss I, who is a regular visitor in the family home.   She
    is an active little girl who was observed to be happy and  comfortable.
    She engaged well with  the  appellant  during  the  prison  visits  and
    demonstrated an appropriate level of attachment.  She did  not  display
    strong signs of distress, other than being sad at having to  leave  her
    father behind, when leaving the prison.  The social  worker  said  this
    can indicate that she has a secure attachment to him and  feels  secure
    in the knowledge that she will be seeing him again soon.

41.  The report then addressed the concerns for S should  the  appellant  be
    deported from the UK and how this will  impact  on  her  emotional  and
    behavioural  development.    The  report   stated   that   before   his
    incarceration the appellant offered a high level of support to his wife
    to ensure that they are able to meet S's  needs.   Studies  have  shown
    that children who lose a parental figure can  live  with  a  number  of
    mostly unanswerable questions which reside at a  deep  and  unconscious
    level, possibly never coming into conscious  thought  but  nevertheless
    constantly there and constantly  troubling  them.  The  result  of  the
    deportation can result in S's feeling  of  abandonment  as  well  as  a
    negative impact on her sense of identity and her  rights  to  a  family
    life.   Such feelings and unanswered questions are  often  too  painful
    for children to face alone and underlies  much  of  the  emotional  and
    behavioural problems that can telescope in childhood and further on  in
    adulthood.

42.  The report said the appellant has been a constant figure  in  S's  life
    since her birth in July 2010.  He was a  daily  member  of  the  family
    living in the same property with AR and S until  his  incarceration  in
    September 2013.  It was observed during her visits that  the  appellant
    and S have a  warm,  loving  and  engaging  relationship.   A  possible
    deportation of the appellant could result in damage  to  S's  emotional
    and behavioural development and missing out on  her  relationship  with
    her father. It was noted, however, that no developmental concerns  have
    been raised in respect of S by the GP family support worker or  by  the
    nursery staff.  The child and family assessment has not identified  any
    concerns that AR is not meeting the needs of  S. AR is  currently  able
    to meet the day-to-day needs of S and shows insight in  being  able  to
    safeguard  her.   AR  shows  insight  in  how  her  health  issues  can
    potentially affect S and with the help of Miss I is able to safeguard S
    from this having a negative impact on  her  emotional  and  behavioural
    development.  AR is linked with the localities team and is  working  on
    establishing  boundaries  which  will  continue  to   assist   in   S's
    development.

43.  The social worker felt that there  is  currently  no  concern  in  AR's
    ability to care for S with the assistance of Miss I who is taking  over
    the role of Mr Rowe. She said it was important  however  to  note  that
    Miss I is suffering from  a  terminal  illness  and  that  should  this
    support fall away for AR and S and the appellant has  not  returned  to
    the family  home, there will be a potential concern for AR to meet  the
    needs of S.  The social worker felt that the potential  deportation  of
    the appellant would have  a  negative  effect  on  S  and  her  ongoing
    emotional and behavioural development as well as AR's ability  to  meet
    S's long term needs due to her own issues.   Furthermore,  due  to  the
    nature of AR's health issues it would not be possible for her to reside
    in Jamaica and she would not be  able  to  access  the  same  level  of
    treatment that she is currently engaging with in the UK.   Therefore  a
    possible deportation would mean a permanent splitting up of the  family
    with potential negative impact on S's ongoing development, self  esteem
    and identity.   Should the appellant be deported  family  services  may
    need to become involved and explore measures to  be  put  in  place  to
    safeguard S and support AR.

44.  I find that this case is finely balanced on  the  evidence.   First  of
    all the deportation of the  appellant  does  not  have  to  lead  to  a
    permanent splitting up of the family.   The  appellant  can  apply  for
    revocation of the  deportation  order  and  the  application  would  be
    considered in the light of the circumstances of the family appertaining
    at the date of the application.

45.  I am not persuaded by the social worker's report that  the  appellant's
    wife is unable to meet S's long term  needs  due  to  her  own  medical
    condition should the appellant be deported  from  the  UK.  The  report
    states no concerns have been raised about  AR's  parenting  skills  and
    there were no indicators that she was not meeting the needs of  S.   At
    the moment however AR has the support of her mother, Miss I.  I  accept
    that Miss I suffers from a terminal illness.    In  the  absence  of  a
    medical report on Miss I, there is no  way  of  knowing  how  long  her
    support for AR and S can continue.   For  the  moment  however  she  is
    available and able to give them the support that the claimant is unable
    to give whilst he is in prison,  and  indeed  while  he  commuted  some
    distance to take part in the criminal enterprise.  No doubt that Miss I
    will continue support her  daughter  and  S  should  the  appellant  be
    deported from the UK.  If there comes a time when Miss I is  no  longer
    able to offer them her support, the evidence is  that  social  services
    will come to their aid.  In the light of this evidence I find that  the
    effect of the appellant's deportation on AR will not be unduly harsh.

46.  It is the concern for S that makes this case finely  balanced.  At  the
    moment S seems to be a well adjusted, active and happy child.   She  is
    well cared for by her mother and grandmother  in  the  absence  of  her
    father.   The  social  worker's  report  indicates   that   since   his
    incarceration in September 2013 the appellant has been visited  by  his
    wife and  daughter  approximately  once  or  twice  a  month.   He  has
    telephone contact with his family almost daily and also writes  letters
    to his daughter which she talks fondly of. S makes lots of drawings for
    her father which she takes with her when visits him.   On this evidence
    what will cease in the event of his deportation  will  be  the  regular
    visits by his wife and daughter. I am assuming that he will continue to
    maintain telephone contact with his family and continue to write to his
    daughter.  The social worker relies on studies which  have  shown  that
    children who lose a parental figure can live with a  number  of  mostly
    answerable questions which reside at  a  deep  and  unconscious  level,
    possibly  never  coming  into  conscious   thought   but   nevertheless
    constantly  there  and  constantly  troubling  them.   The  result   of
    deportation can result in S's feelings of  abandonment  as  well  as  a
    negative impact on her sense of identity and her right to family  life.
    Such feelings and  unanswered  questions  are  often  too  painful  for
    children to face alone underlines much of the emotional and behavioural
    problems that can develop in childhood and further on in adulthood.

47.  I find that the appellant's deportation  will  mean  that  he  will  no
    longer have a physical presence in the UK and therefore S will  lose  a
    parental figure.  Nevertheless his contact with her  by  telephone  and
    letters will mean that the loss will not be a  total  abandonment.   In
    any event, the report when on to say that AR and S have a good level of
    support from the localities team,  family  as  well  as  mental  health
    professionals  and  that  should  the  appellant  be  deported,  family
    services may need to become involved and explore  measures  to  put  in
    place to safeguard S and support AR.   This means that AR  and  S  will
    not be left without support.  I find on the evidence that the effect of
    the appellant's deportation on his wife and child would not  be  unduly
    harsh.

48.  I find that  there  is  a  strong  public  interest  in  deporting  the
    claimant from the UK. The trial judge considered it a  serious  offence
    such that it merited a custodial sentence.  The trial  judge  was  well
    aware of the health difficulties of the claimant's wife  and  the  fact
    that they were reliant upon the care  that  he  offered.   Despite  his
    circumstances, the trial judge took the  view  that  only  a  custodial
    sentence could  be justified in this case. His family have coped in his
    absence.  I find on the evidence that the public interest in  deporting
    the claimant outweighs the impact his deportation  would  have  on  his
    wife and child.

49.  The appellant's appeal against the deportation decision is dismissed.
