Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer.
For the Respondent:    Mr H McCusker, instructed by McAuley McCarthy & Co.

                                 WITHDRAWAL

 1. At the hearing of this appeal Mr Matthews sought leave to withdraw  the
    Secretary of State's appeal against the decision of First-tier Tribunal
    Judge Balloch, promulgated 21 January 2015.   There  was  no  objection
    from Mr McCusker and I gave leave as sought.

 2. As a consequence there is no longer any appeal  pending  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal and the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Balloch  stands.
