                               ZUZANA SAPAROVA
                                                                  Respondent


For the appellant:     Ms Aboni, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the respondent:    None


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant ('the SSHD') has appealed against a decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal dated 26 May 2017  in  which  it  allowed  Ms  Saparova's
    appeal against the SSHD's decision dated 14 March 2017  to  refuse  her
    application for a permanent residence card.  The appeal was  determined
    on  the  papers  and  without  a  hearing.   The  First-tier   Tribunal
    considered substantial further documentation not available to the  SSHD
    and concluded that the appellant had "indeed been residing  in  the  UK
    for a continuous period of 5 years and therefore she should be  granted
    a permanent residence card".

 2. Having heard from Ms Saparova, I indicated that the First-tier Tribunal
    failed to make a clear finding that there was five years  residence  in
    accordance with EU Treaty rights and this constituted an error of  law.
    Mrs Aboni agreed that the decision should be remade by me and requested
    time to consider the documents submitted to  the  First-tier  Tribunal,
    but not yet considered by the SSHD.


 3. I stood the matter down to  enable  Ms  Aboni  to  check  the  original
    documentation relating to Ms Saparova's employment in the  UK.   Before
    doing so, Ms Saparova provided an outline of her employment in the  UK:
    she worked in nurseries until she and her  husband  opened  a  cafï¿½  in
    Leigh, where she has been working since around 2008.


 4. When  the  hearing  resumed,  Ms  Aboni  expressly  accepted  that  the
    documentation entirely supported the appellant's claim to have been  in
    genuine  employment  in  the  UK  in  the  five  years  preceding   her
    application in February 2017 and  beyond.   In  the  circumstances,  Ms
    Aboni conceded the only issue in dispute by accepting that Ms  Saparova
    was residing in the UK  for  a  continuous  period  of  five  years  in
    accordance with EU Treaty rights.  Ms Aboni therefore accepted  that  I
    should remake the decision by allowing the appeal and there was no need
    to hear any further from Ms Saparova.

Decision

 5. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains an error of law and is
    set aside.


 6. I remake the decision by allowing Ms Saparova's appeal.
