	DECISION AND REMITTAL

	This decision is in line with a proposal made to the parties, which has not been the subject of any dissent. 

	I grant permission to appeal.  I determine the appeal by setting aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal for error of law.  I remit the appeal for substantive determination by the First-tier Tribunal.
