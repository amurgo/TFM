                               Dragan Planinic
                        (no anonymity direction made)
                                                                   Appellant
                                     And

               The Secretary of State for the Home Department
                                                                  Respondent


For the Appellant:     Mr Wood, Immigration Advice Service (Manchester)
For the Respondent:    Mr McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. The Appellant is a national of Bosnia and  Herzegovina  born  on  the
       10th August 1960. He appeals with  permission  the  decision  of  the
       First-tier Tribunal (Judge D Alty) to dismiss his  appeal  under  the
       Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulation 2016.

    2. This appeal is settled by consent.  Following  the  decision  of  the
       European Court of Justice in  Banger  v  United  Kingdom  C89/17  the
       Secretary of State accepts  that  the  Appellant  is  entitled  to  a
       residence card confirming his right of residence as a Surinder  Singh
       partner.   The  First-tier  Tribunal  erred  in  finding   otherwise.
       Following the decisions in Khan v Secretary of  State  for  the  Home
       Department [2017] EWCA Civ 1755 and SM (Algeria) v ECO [2018] UKSC  9
       the Secretary of State further accepts that the  First-tier  Tribunal
       was wrong  to  find,  in  the  alternative,  that  it  did  not  have
       jurisdiction to  consider  whether  the  Appellant  qualified  as  an
       'extended family member'.

  Decision

    3. The determination of the  First-tier  Tribunal  contains  a  material
       error of law and it is set aside.

    4. The decision in the appeal is: "the appeal is allowed".

    5. There is no order for anonymity.
