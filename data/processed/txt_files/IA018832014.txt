                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr g Harrison (Senior Home Office Presenting
                  Officer)
For the Respondent:  Mr A Lee (Medivas)

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.   This is an appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  by  the  Respondent,  with
    permission, against the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Raikes promulgated on 9th September  2014  by  which  she  allowed  the
    Appellant's appeal against the Secretary of State's decision to  refuse
    her leave to remain in the UK on the basis of her  private  and  family
    life and to remove her to Zimbabwe.

2.   For the purposes of continuity I shall refer in this  determination  to
    the Secretary  of  State  as  the  Respondent  and  Miss  Mele  as  the
    Appellant.

3.   The Secretary of State's  grounds  argue  that  the  Judge  misdirected
    herself in relation to her approach to Article 8 and whether or not she
    should have considered Article 8 outside  the  Immigration  Rules.  The
    grounds point out that at paragraph 36 of the determination  the  Judge
    stated that she was not satisfied that  the  Appellant's  circumstances
    justified an exercise of discretion to  grant  leave  on  compassionate
    grounds. It is then argued that having so found the  Judge  should  not
    have considered Article 8 outside the Rules.  The facts were  the  same
    and her finding meant that there was nothing about her case  which  was
    of a compelling or exceptional nature to warrant a  grant  outside  the
    Rules. The grounds also argue that the Judge did not deal properly with
    or make findings as to why she found there to be  family  life  between
    this Appellant, who is an adult, and her family members.

4.   The facts of this case  are  that  the  Appellant  entered  the  UK  in
    December 2006 as a work permit dependent.  She was  granted  subsequent
    extensions of leave, latterly as a dependent child over the age of  18,
    valid until October 2013. She made an in time application for leave  to
    remain under appendix FM. That application was refused by the Secretary
    of State on 12th December 2013 on  the  basis  she  did  not  meet  the
    requirements under paragraph  276  ADE  and  could  not  succeed  under
    Appendix FM.

5.   It is clear, as stated in  the  determination  and  in  the  letter  of
    refusal, that  the Appellant applied for leave to remain under Appendix
    FM when she could not meet the requirements as she was over the age  of
    18 and not dependent upon her parents. The only issue under  the  Rules
    therefore was paragraph 276 ADE.

6.   The Appellant argued in her notice of appeal that she  had  established
    family and private life in the UK and ought to succeed on that basis.

7.   The Appellant's case was that she had come to the UK with  her  brother
    to join her family in 2006 and thus has lived in the UK from the age of
    17 ï¿½ to the present day, which by the date of the First-tier Tribunal's
    consideration was  seven  years  and  eight  months.  She  has  visited
    Zimbabwe only once in that time, to  attend  her  sisters  wedding.  in
    Zimbabwe she lodged with her family in a house because her  father  was
    living in accommodation provided  by  his  work  which   only  has  one
    bedroom. Her father, who remains in Zimbabwe, visits the family in  the
    UK often but apart from him she has no close ties to Zimbabwe. Her  two
    best friends from Zimbabwe also now live in the UK.

8.   Since she has been in the UK the  Appellant  has  attended  school  and
    further education and is now employed on a  full-time  basis.  She  has
    made lifelong  friends  in  the  community  in  the  UK  and  is  fully
    integrated into the community in Nottingham.
9.   Her father left the UK in 2010 in order to work in Zimbabwe  and  since
    that time she has assisted her mother with the bills by part-time  work
    and now full time work. She has  also  assisted  her  mother  with  her
    brother's upbringing.

10.  Her case is that if returned to Zimbabwe  she  would  have  nowhere  to
    live and while her father is there, his accommodation is  not  suitable
    for her and once his current  employment  contract  ceases  it  is  his
    intention to apply to come to the UK  to  join  his  family.  She  left
    Zimbabwe at the age of 17 and is now aged 28. Additionally she has been
    in a relationship in the UK for some five years and 11 months  and  she
    and her partner, although they do not live together,  have  made  plans
    for the future together.

11.  The Judge's findings of fact on the evidence start at paragraph  31  of
    her determination. She found the Appellant and those who gave  evidence
    on her behalf to be honest and credible witnesses and  she  noted  that
    the Appellant had at all times been in the UK lawfully.  She  said  she
    was satisfied that the Appellant has a close and loving family  in  the
    UK and that her mother and brother have been granted  indefinite  leave
    to remain. She accepted that the  Appellant,  having  obtained  various
    qualifications, was now living and working  in  the  UK  and  she  also
    accepted that she is in a long-term relationship with her  partner  and
    although his immigration status is of a temporary nature, they hope  to
    build their future together.

12.  The Judge then at paragraph 34 found that the Appellant has  family  in
    Zimbabwe and that her claim as contained within her statement that  she
    would have nowhere to go and no one to live with  was  overstated.  She
    found that albeit contact was sporadic she had extended family  members
    in Zimbabwe as well as her father, although he had stated an  intention
    to seek leave to enter the  UK  in  the  future.  She  also  noted  the
    evidence regarding the inadequacy  of  the  father's  accommodation  in
    Zimbabwe but also that there was no documentary evidence to support the
    fact that she could not live with him. She did however accept the  oral
    evidence that there would be difficulties in the  father  accommodating
    his daughter.

13.  At paragraph 36 the Judge considered paragraph 276 ADE  of  the  Rules.
    She noted the Appellant had been in the UK since 2006  and  her  mother
    and only brother and other  family  members  are  here  with  leave  to
    remain. However she had not lived in the UK continuously for  20  years
    and she was not satisfied that the Appellant had no ties  to  Zimbabwe.
    She concluded that paragraph by saying:-

         "I am not satisfied  her  circumstances  were  she  to  return  to
         Zimbabwe would have justified an exercise of discretion or grant of
         leave on compassionate grounds. I am not satisfied  therefore  that
         the Appellant has met the Immigration Rules as stated."


14.  At paragraph 37 the judge  notes  that  the  Appellant  does  not  fall
    within any of the exceptions under the Rules.

15.  The Judge then goes on, without  explanation,  to  consider  Article  8
    outside the Rules. She does not explain what in the factual  matrix  of
    this case justified a consideration outside the Rules and what  was  in
    the factual matrix which was not dealt with under the  Rules.  Arguably
    there was nothing.

16.  In the Judge's  consideration  of  Article  8,  which  is  lengthy  and
    detailed, she finds family life to exist between the Appellant and  her
    family in the UK but does not explain why this is given that  there  is
    no dependency over the normal emotional ties of an adult with her wider
    family (Kugathas [2003] EWCA Civ 31).  This is not a case  of  a  young
    adult who has just turned 18.  She is 25 and in  full  time  employment
    and  considering  a  life  away  from  the  family  with  her  partner.
    Additionally, her younger brother with whom she claims a quasi parental
    responsibility is now some 16 years of age and on his own  evidence  is
    fairly independent. Indeed he  remained  in  the  UK  when  the  family
    travelled to Zimbabwe for the sisters wedding.

17.  At paragraph 46 odf the determination the Judge noted  the  requirement
    to consider section 117, inserted into the Nationality, Immigration and
    Asylum Act 2002 by section 19 of the Immigration Act  2014.  She  found
    that the Appellant speaks English and has at no time  been  in  the  UK
    unlawfully nor has her status ever been precarious. She said  that  she
    had found that the Appellant had a significant private life,  including
    her work, friends  and  partner  and  a  meaningful  and  close  family
    relationship with her mother, brother and other family. Shee  concluded
    that paragraph by saying that she found that  the  Appellant's  removal
    would be justifiably harsh and therefore disproportionate.

18.  In defence of the determination Mr Lee  provided  a  skeleton  argument
    which he expanded before  me.  He  argued  that  the  Judge  had  taken
    everything fully into account and given all matters full consideration.
    He argued that the judge was entitled to consider Article 8 outside the
    Rules and pointed out that the Appellant  lived  with  her  mother  and
    brother and there had been only one visit to Zimbabwe since her arrival
    in 2006. There had not been frequent contact with family there and  she
    had been fully educated and was now working in the UK. Additionally she
    has a partner with whom she has a genuine and subsisting  relationship.
    Her ties to Zimbabwe, he argued, are weak.

19.  He pointed out that the  Judge  set  out  the  Razgar  [2004]  UKHL  27
    principles and dealt with those on a step-by-step basis.

20.  With regard to the question of family life as an adult, he argued  that
    the Judge clearly indicated that she found the Appellant to  be  in   a
    close and loving relationship with her family and in terms of  Kugathas
    and Nasim (Article 8) [2014] UKUT 00025 (IAC) the judge had  found  the
    ties to her mother and brother were particularly strong  and  that  she
    had spent her entire adult life in  the  UK.  She  has  no  friends  in
    Zimbabwe; all her ties are to the UK. He  argued  that  the  Judge  was
    entitled to find compelling circumstances and insurmountable  obstacles
    why she could not return to Zimbabwe.
21.  I find that the Judge in this case has made a  material  error  of  law
    such that the determination must be set aside.

22.  The judge has made completely contradictory findings in  terms  of  her
    consideration of  paragraph  276  ADE  and  Article  8.  She  correctly
    concluded that the Appellant could not succeed under Appendix FM as she
    is now an adult who is working and who has  no  dependents.  The  Judge
    then considered paragraph 276 ADE and taking all of the  evidence  into
    account found that the Appellant could not succeed on  that  basis.  If
    the Appellant could not succeed under  paragraph  276  ADE,  the  Judge
    finding there to be no compassionate reasons to allow the appeal, it is
    then wholly contradictory to go on and consider that she should succeed
    on Article 8 grounds outside the Rules.

23.  The Judge should have concluded the determination at paragraph 37.  Her
    error was to consider and allow the appeal under the  ECHR  on  exactly
    the same facts that led her to dismiss it under the Rules.

24.  There is nothing unusual about this case  to  justify  a  consideration
    under the ECHR. Additionally, the Judge erred in her  consideration  of
    section 117 as she appears to to have proceeded on the basis that where
    an Appellant speaks English and has been here lawfully that is a  point
    in her favour whereas in fact it simply means that  those points do not
    count against her.

25.  As the Judge approached Article 8  on  a  wholly  erroneous  basis  the
    determination must be set aside in its entirety.

26.  As matters will have inevitably moved on since  the  original  decision
    and the First-tier Tribunal's consideration it  will  be  necessary  to
    hear evidence and for that  reason  I  remit  the  appeal  for  a  full
    rehearing before the First-tier Tribunal.

27.  The appeal to the Upper Tribunal is allowed.

28.  Having remitted the appeal to the  First-tier  Tribunal  it  should  be
    listed for hearing at Stoke hearing centre.
