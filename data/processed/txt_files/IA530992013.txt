                       (ANONYMITY DIRECTION NOT MADE)
                                                                  Respondent

For the Respondent:    Mr N Garrod, Counsel instructed by Justice and Law
Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   In this determination the Appellant is referred to as the Secretary  of
    State.  The Respondent is referred to as the Claimant.

2.   The Claimant, a national of Ghana, date of birth 3 July 1976,  appealed
    against the Secretary of State's decision dated  13  December  2013  to
    refuse to issue a residence card with reference to  Regulations  7  and
    8(5) of the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006  (the
    2006 Regulations).

3.   In a determination promulgated on 2 October 2014 I  found  that  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Symes erred in  failing  to  consider  the  claimed
    marriage between the Claimant and his European  Economic  Area  partner
    national of Belgium, Ms Ruth Osei by reference  to  the  considerations
    arising from Kareem (Proxy marriages - EU law) Nigeria [2014]  UKUT  24
    or TA (Kareem explained) [2014] UKUT 316.  The judge also failed to  go
    on to consider the alternative of whether the Claimant might qualify as
    a person in a durable relationship with an EEA National.   Accordingly,
    I found for reasons given that the original Tribunal's  decision  could
    not stand and the matter would have to be remade.

4.   Directions were given to address the issue of whether or not the  proxy
    marriage is recognised by the EEA National's law  or  alternatively  on
    the basis of an enduring relationship under the EEA Regulations.

5.   At the hearing on 19 December 2014 there was produced on behalf of  the
    Claimant a report, which had not  been  served  as  my  directions  had
    intended, from a Professor Dr Jinske Verhellen of the  law  faculty  of
    the Institute of Private International Law in Ghent, Belgium, dated  12
    December 2014.

6.   The Secretary of State's  grounds  of  appeal  did  not  challenge  the
    judge's findings on the validity  of  the  marriage  in  terms  of  the
    processes of registration followed as set  out  in  the  findings  from
    paragraphs 21 to 30 of the determination.

7.   The expert opinion makes plain  that  for  Belgian  administrative  and
    judicial authorities' purposes foreign marriages are  governed  by  the
    Belgian Code of Private International Law (PIL  Code).   From  this  it
    appears that under the PIL Code recognition of foreign  authentic  acts
    means that they can be recognised by the Belgian authorities  but  also
    that the foreign marriage must comply with  the  same  conditions  that
    would have to be fulfilled under Belgian Conflict Rules if the marriage
    were to take place in Belgium.  The Belgian  authorities  if  presented
    with a foreign marriage certificate will check the applicable  law  and
    verify whether the foreign authorities have come to a  similar  result.
    The conditions regarding the validity of the marriage are governed  for
    each spouse by the law of the state of the  spouse's  nationality  when
    the marriage was celebrated.

8.   Thus the key question is whether the Ghanaian marriage  certificate  in
    this case is recognised in Belgium; being a marriage that took place by
    proxy.  There is nothing to indicate that the Claimant's Sponsor,  Ruth
    Osei, a Belgian national, born on 20  May  1970,  would  not  have  the
    capacity to marry.  It is  clear  that  Belgian  law  recognises  proxy
    marriages provided the formalities regarding  the  celebration  of  the
    marriage are governed by the law of the state of the territory in which
    the marriage is celebrated.

9.   By reference  to  examples  in  Belgium  law,  Professor  Dr  Verhellen
    concluded that on the information provided of the  relevant  law  where
    the marriage was celebrated was  met,  the  conditions  concerning  the
    validity of the marriage in Nigeria are on the face of it  met  and  so
    far as Ms Osei's marriage is concerned it is valid under Belgian law.

10.  The Claimant and his partner were not called to  give  evidence.   What
    was essentially relied upon are:- the credibility finding made  by  the
    judge that the Claimant and the Sponsor's relationship was genuine  and
    the Sponsor  was  exercising  treaty  rights  in  the  United  Kingdom.
    Further relied upon was the Claimant's statement  (Appellant's  Bundle)
    (AB) (AB pp 15 - 19) and the Sponsor's statement (AB pp 20 -  23).   In
    addition relied upon are payslips, employers'  letters  (AB  pp  151  -
    163), a tenancy agreement and HMRC documentation  and  BT  and  utility
    bills (AB pp 222 - 226  and  164).   Also  relied  upon  was  that  the
    durability of the relationship was not substantively challenged.  There
    was of course no testing of the evidence because the Claimant  and  the
    Sponsor did not give evidence.

11.   At  the  hearing,  given  the  very  late  receipt  of  Professor   Dr
    Verhellen's report, I decided that the Secretary of State  should  have
    an opportunity to serve any written response  to  his  report  but  not
    later than 12 January 2015 and if a response was served  to  serve  any
    reply by 23 January 2015.

12.  I was provided with an extensive CV of Dr Verhellen  and  it  is  plain
    that he is a distinguished academic as well as being a  lawyer  at  the
    Ghent Barclays Bank PLC dealing in private  international  law  (family
    law), immigration law and nationality law.  He is currently a professor
    of law at Ghent University as well as a visiting lecturer elsewhere.

13.  The allegation that it was a marriage of convenience was  abandoned  by
    Mr Deller for proper reasons on 22 September 2014.

14.  Submissions for the Claimant made in writing to  the  effect  that  the
    burden is upon the Secretary of State to prove a marriage is not valid.
     I do not agree with those submissions and  find  that  the  burden  of
    proof is upon the Claimant to show upon a balance of probabilities that
    the relevant  marriage  requirements,  for  the  purposes  of  the  EEA
    legislation, are met.

15.  The response from the Secretary of State to  the  Verhellen  report  is
    really a criticism of the adequacy  of  its  contents  rather  than  an
    assertion of  contrary  law.   From  the  Verhellen  report  part  III,
    assessing there was capacity to marry by proxy  and  the  marriage  was
    properly celebrated  and  recorded  in  Ghana,  it  appeared  that  the
    marriage would have to be  transcribed  (registered)  in  the  'Belgian
    Civil Registry'.  On the facts it does not appear that the marriage has
    been so registered in the Belgian Civil Registry.  Thus I do  not  find
    that the Claimant has established that there was a valid  marriage  for
    the purposes of the requirements of the EEA Regulations.

    I did not receive a reply  from  the  Claimant,  to  the  Secretary  of
    State's comments.

16.  I find upon a balance of probabilities on  the  evidence,  particularly
    the finding that the relationship is genuine made  by  the  judge,  the
    Claimant has discharged the burden of proof that  there  is  a  durable
    relationship.   There  is  a  good  deal  of  unchallenged  documentary
    evidence that supports the relationship and of living together.

17.  In those circumstances I find that the Claimant and Sponsor  are  in  a
    durable committed relationship.

NOTICE OF DECISION

The appeal on immigration grounds is dismissed, in  relation  to  the  proxy
marriage and  its  status  in  Belgian,  under  Regulation  7  of  the  2006
Regulations.

The appeal is allowed under Regulation 8 of the 2006 Regulations.

ANONYMITY ORDER

No anonymity order was requested or necessary.

TO THE RESPONDENT

FEE AWARD

The original Tribunal made a fee award in the sum of ï¿½140 in favour  of  the
Claimant.   I  find  the  appeal  has  succeeded  because  of  more   recent
documentation  being  provided  properly  addressing  the   issue   of   the
durability of their marriage.

In the circumstances I find that a fee award is not appropriate.
