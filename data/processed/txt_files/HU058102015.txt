                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   This appeal is brought by  the  appellant,  a  citizen  of  Bangladesh,
    against the decision of First-tier Tribunal (FtT) Judge Reid sent on 14
    February 2017 dismissing her appeal against the decision  made  by  the
    respondent refusing her entry clearance as a partner under Appendix  FM
    of the Immigration Rules.  The ECO's  refusal  decision,  having  noted
    that the Rules required the appellant, in  order  to  meet  the  formal
    requirements to show a gross income of at least  �18,600,  stated  that
    although she had submitted documents stating that  the  sponsor  earned
    �18,900 as a chef with SR Restaurant Ltd, the TSB  Bank  statements  in
    the sponsor's name "do not reflect the amount shown in  your  sponsor's
    payslips.  You have not provided any satisfactory explanation for these
    discrepancies and I am not  satisfied  your  sponsor's  employment  and
    earnings are  as  stated".   In  the  Entry  Clearance  Manager  Review
    confirming the ECO's decision,  the  comment  was  added:  "Whilst  not
    obligatory, it  could  have  been  possible  to  provide  a  letter  of
    confirmation of earnings from HMRC but this was not provided".

2.   The judge noted that the evidence before him now included a new  letter
    dated 26 January 2017 from HMRC confirming that the  appellant's  gross
    salary was �18,900 and a 2015-2016 P60 which had not  been  before  the
    ECO.  The judge also noted that he had before him  a  letter  from  the
    sponsor's employer stating that the sponsor was taking salary  advances
    weekly which reconciled to his  monthly  wages;  that  his  salary  was
    credited weekly but in some weeks his salary would not be credited four
    times (it could be three or five) and that the employer would  if  need
    be adjust the salary at the end of the month by paying him  cash.   The
    judge also recorded the respondent's submission as  being  that  "[t]he
    amount being paid weekly into the TSB account  was  around  �304  (net)
    which was broadly consistent with  the  gross  annual  salary  claimed"
    (para 6).

3.   Having identified that the payslips and bank  statements  submitted  by
    the appellant covered the requisite six month period counting back from
    the date of application in June 2015, (May 2015 -  December  2014)  the
    judge stated at para 17:

         "17. I find that the sponsor was paid at intervals during the month
             usually around  weekly  but  that  his  payslips  were  issued
             monthly  (letter  dated  14th  May  2015  from  the  sponsor's
             employer, SR Restaurant Ltd trading as Paper Duck).   Payments
             consistent with a usually around weekly practice were made  in
             the period from December 2014 to May 2015 into  the  sponsor's
             TSB account, designated wages."

4.   The judge then listed the payslips and the corresponding  TSB  receipts
    for dates on 31 December 2014, 2 February 2015,  28  February  2015,  3
    March, 30 April, 31 May 2015.  Having noted that the payslips  net  pay
    was �7,927.32 and the total TSB receipts �7,550,  the  judge  said  the
    amount did not match.  The judge then concluded:

         "20. I have also however assessed this in  the  round  over  the  6
             month period to take account of any payments made for  example
             at the end of a month but relating to a week at the  beginning
             of the  next  month  or  vice  versa.   The  amounts  actually
             received over 6 months also did not match up  with  the  total
             net pay on the payslips for those 6 months.  I have  not  been
             provided with an explanation for this shortfall.


         21.  The decision was therefore correct that the payments made into
             the TSB account in the 6 months prior to the  application  did
             not match the payslips provided.


         22.  Notwithstanding this, the letter dated 26th January 2017  from
             HMRC records the sponsor's gross salary in the tax year  2014-
             2015 as �7,875 (5  months),  equating  to  gross  �18,900  pa,
             consistent with  the  2014-2015  P60.   For  2015-2016  it  is
             recorded as �18,900 gross pa, consistent  with  the  2016-2016
             P60.  Throughout the  6  month  period  on  the  payslips  the
             monthly gross salary is �1,575 equating to  �18,900  pa  gross
             which is the salary stated in the contract of employment (page
             A16-17).  I therefore find that the salary  declared  to  HMRC
             and on which tax was paid was at  the  time  of  the  decision
             (looking back at the previous 6 months) �18,900 gross pa.


         23.  However, it remains the case  that  the  net  amounts  payable
             under the payslips were not on the evidence before me in  fact
             paid to the sponsor.  The Appellant did not therefore  satisfy
             the evidence requirements in para 2(c) of Appendix FM-SE  that
             the salary stated in the  payslips  has  been  paid  into  the
             sponsor's  account.   No  explanation  for   this   particular
             discrepancy has been provided in the witness statements of the
             Appellant or the sponsor.  The letter from the employer  dated
             14th May 2015 (said  by  the  Appellant  and  the  sponsor  to
             resolve any confusion) only explains the  weekly  payments  in
             advance and a reconciliation at the end of the month; it  does
             not explain why either looking at it monthly or looking at  it
             overall over a 6 month period the total amount  payable  under
             the payslips was not in practice paid to the sponsor."

5.   Paragraph 23 evinces a number of difficulties.   First  of  all,  there
    was no longer any issue in this case  that  the  sponsor's  salary  was
    �18,900.  Paragraph 22 acknowledges this but then fails to consider its
    relevance to the issue under paragraph  2(c)  of  Appendix  FM-SE  when
    considering whether  there  was  a  satisfactory  explanation  for  the
    discrepancies, notwithstanding that they were clearly minor.  Secondly,
    the respondent had accepted in submissions  that  "[t]he  amount  being
    paid weekly into the TSB  account  was  around  �304  (net)  which  was
    broadly consistent with the gross annual  salary  claimed".   This  too
    should have been considered  relevant  to  the  issue  of  explanation.
    Thirdly, the judge appears to  have  required  a  perfect  arithmetical
    match between payslips and bank receipts,  whereas  the  relevant  Rule
    only speaks of "correspondence".

6.   Indeed the relevant Rule  only  requires  "[p]ersonal  bank  statements
    corresponding  to  the  same  period(s)  as   the   payslips"...;   the
    correspondence is between periods of time, not solely in amount.   Even
    though in the appellant's case there was the complicating  factor  that
    he was paid weekly, not monthly, there was  sufficient  consistency  to
    constitute correspondence.  To the extent there was  a  discrepancy  it
    was not, as the judge described, a "shortfall", but a slight excess (of
    payslip amounts over bank receipts).  In requiring an explanation as to
    why the two sets of figures did not perfectly match, the judge  applied
    paragraph 2(c) far more restrictively than was justified.  Had  it  not
    been for the judge's mistaken application of paragraph 2(c) it is clear
    that the judge would have allowed the  appeal  on  Article  8  grounds,
    there being no public interest in denying entry clearance to  a  person
    who in fact met the requirements of the Rules.

7.   Even if I had found that the judge's application of paragraph 2(c)  was
    open to him, I would have expected considerably  more  from  the  judge
    when  reasoning  why  the  decision  was  not  contrary  to  Article  8
    consideration outside the Rules, particularly bearing in mind that  the
    respondent at the hearing expressed satisfaction that the amount  being
    paid weekly into the TSB account was "broadly consistent with the gross
    annual salary claimed".

8.   For the above reasons I conclude that the  judge  materially  erred  in
    law and that his decision is to be set aside.

9.   In this case the decision I re-make can be stated  quite  shortly.   On
    the available evidence there was sufficient correspondence between  the
    payslips  and  the  bank  statements   over   the   relevant   periods.
    Accordingly, the appellant met  the  requirements  of  the  Immigration
    Rules.  There is not a public interest in refusing to grant  her  entry
    clearance, as it was only the issue of the financial requirements  that
    had been in dispute.  Accordingly, it  would  be  disproportionate  and
    contrary to Article 8 to refuse entry clearance.

10. I would add the following observation.  At the hearing  the  judge  was
    informed that the sponsor now had a new employer,  Once  Upon  a  Thai,
    which he said he started on 22 October 2016.   Although  the  appellant
    was not required for the purposes of the appeal against the decision of
    the ECO dated 20 August 2015 to evidence the gross salary (stated to be
    �19,000 per annum) or to produce  payslips  and  bank  statements  that
    corresponded for a specified period, the evidence he  did  produce  was
    considered by the judge to be insufficient.  The appellant may wish  to
    assist the ECO, in deciding what steps to take in light of my decision,
    to produce further payslips and  bank  statements,  together  with  any
    available HMRC evidence in support.  Such action may facilitate a grant
    of entry clearance being made sooner rather than later.


Notice of Decision

The decision of the FtT judge is set aside for material error of law.

The decision I re-make is to allow the appellant's appeal.

No anonymity direction is made.
