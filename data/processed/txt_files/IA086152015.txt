                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant appeals to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal (Judge Moan sitting at Birmingham  on  17  December
    2015) dismissing his appeal against the decision of  the  Secretary  of
    State  to  refuse  to  issue  him  with  a  residence  card  under  the
    Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 as  the  extended
    family member of an EEA national exercising treaty rights  in  the  UK.
    The First-tier Tribunal did not make an anonymity direction, and  I  do
    not consider the appellant requires anonymity for these proceedings  in
    the Upper Tribunal.







The Reasons for Granting Permission to Appeal

 2. On 7 June 2016 Judge Adio gave his reasons for granting  the  appellant
    permission to appeal.  The positive findings made by the  Judge  raised
    an arguable error of law in view of the outcome of the appeal as  there
    was a lack of clarity in  resolving  the  positive  findings  with  the
    applicable case law of Dauhoo (EEA Regulations - reg 8(2)) [2012]  UKUT
    79 (IAC).

The Rule 24 Response

 3. On 20 June 2016 Karen Pal of the Specialist Appeals Team filed  a  Rule
    24 response on behalf of the Secretary of State.  On the basis  of  the
    evidence before the  Judge  there  was  little  evidence  of  financial
    dependency prior to arrival in the UK and after entry to  the  UK.  The
    Judge was entitled to find that the payments  prior  to  2012  did  not
    constitute dependency.

Relevant Factual Background

 4. The appellant is a Sri Lankan national whose date of birth is 22  April
    1992.  In the summer of 2012  he  applied  for  entry  clearance  as  a
    student. He had savings of �9,000  in  his  bank  account  (application
    details, page 2 of 7). He was granted entry clearance  valid  until  11
    February 2014, and he entered the UK on 5 October 2012. On 28  February
    2014 he applied for further leave to remain  as  a  student,  but  this
    application was refused with no right of appeal on 3 June 2014.

 5. The appellant sought a residence card on 30 September 2014. He said  he
    had lived with his uncle, a French citizen, since arriving  in  the  UK
    and that he had been financially dependent on him prior to arriving  in
    the UK. He provided documentary evidence to show  that  his  uncle  had
    transferred the sum of Rs 60,000 (�627.33 sterling  equivalent  on  the
    exchange rate as at 13 February 2105) to his account every three months
    between the 30 June 2009 and 30 June 2010 by way of a standing order.

 6. In the refusal letter of 13 February 2015 the respondent contended that
    this level of support was not credible  as  his  uncle's  current  wage
    slips showed that he only earned �633 per month. Further,  he  had  not
    provided any evidence of dependency on his sponsor between 30 June 2010
    and his arrival in the UK in October 2012.

The Decision of the First-tier Tribunal

 7. Judge Moan received oral evidence from the appellant and his uncle.  In
    his subsequent decision, he held at paragraph [59] that  there  was  no
    independent evidence to support the claim of financial support prior to
    2009. He accepted at paragraphs [60]  that  the  uncle  had  made  four
    payments of Rs 60,000 in  2009-2010,  and  that,  as  evidenced  by  an
    invoice dated 26 September 2012, the uncle had paid for his  air  fare,
    which cost Rs 63,000.

 8. But at paragraph [61] he said he did not  find  it  credible  that  the
    standing order payments had stopped in 2010 if it  was  true  that  the
    uncle had thereafter continued to support the appellant and his  entire
    family in Sri Lanka. At paragraph [72] he said  he  was  not  satisfied
    that the uncle had  continued  to  send  cash  through  a  friend.  The
    evidence for this had come solely from the appellant, and it was  vague
    in detail.

Discussion

 9. In Ihemedu (OFMs - in meaning) Nigeria [2011] UKUT 00340  (IAC)  Senior
    Immigration Judge Storey, as he then was, gave the  following  guidance
    which is quoted at sub-paragraph 2 of the head note:

         An important consideration in the context of an OFM/extended family
         member case is that if a  claimant  had  come  to  the  UK  without
         applying for a family permit from abroad ..., this will  mean  that
         the  UK  authorities  have  been  prevented  from  conducting   the
         extensive examination of the  individual's  personal  circumstances
         envisaged by Reg 12(3) and in the course  of  such  an  examination
         check the documentation submitted.  If an applicant chooses not  to
         apply from abroad for a family permit under  Reg  12  of  the  2006
         Regulations, thereby denying the UK authorities an  opportunity  to
         check documentation in the country concerned, he cannot expect  any
         relaxation in the burden of proof that applies to him when  seeking
         to establish an EEA right" (my emphasis).

10. In the same case, Judge Storey noted  at  paragraph  [4]  that  Article
    10(2)(e) of the Citizens Directive stipulated  that  in  cases  falling
    under Article 3(2)(a), which deals with OFMs, applicants  must  produce
    "a document issued by the relevant authority in the country  of  origin
    or country from which  they  are  arriving  certifying  that  they  are
    dependants or members of the household of the union citizen ...".

11. The same observation was made in Moneke (EEA  -  OFMs)  Nigeria  [2011]
    UKUT 00341 (IAC) at paragraph [42]:

         We note further that Article 10(2)(e)  of  the  Citizens  Directive
         contemplates documentary evidence.  Whether dependency  could  ever
         be proved by oral testimony alone is not something that we have  to
         decide in this case, but Article 10(2)(e)  does  suggest  that  the
         responsibility is on the applicant  to  satisfy  the  Secretary  of
         State by cogent evidence that is in part documented  (my  emphasis)
         and can be tested as to whether the level of material support,  its
         duration and its impact upon the applicant combined  together  meet
         the  material definition of dependency.

12. On the topic of current dependency, Judge Moan  gave  adequate  reasons
    for finding that the appellant had not shown that the  disclosed  level
    of financial support in the UK from his uncle showed that he needed his
    uncle's financial support to meet his essential needs. But he  accepted
    that the appellant probably lived with his uncle, and so  by  necessary
    implication he accepted that the appellant was a member of his  uncle's
    household. Following Dauhoo, which the judge cited at  paragraph  [20],
    it followed that it was not essential that the appellant  should  prove
    current dependency in order to qualify as an OFM.

13. But the appellant still had to prove prior dependency (as  it  was  not
    suggested that he had been a member of his uncle's household in  either
    France or Sri Lanka). Mr Junior, who did not appear below, submits that
    the judge did not adequately engage with the  oral  evidence  that  the
    uncle financially supported the appellant in the period 2010 to 2012 in
    ways which did not show up in the documentary evidence. In essence  his
    submission is that the judge ought to  have  found  credible  the  oral
    evidence of the appellant that his uncle gave money to friends to  pass
    on to him.

14. The fact that the judge made positive findings about financial  support
    where this was shown by documentary  evidence  does  not  mean  it  was
    irrational of the judge to make adverse  findings  about  the  lack  of
    financial support, and hence dependency, where there was an absence  of
    supporting  documentary  evidence.  On  the  contrary,  the   lack   of
    supporting documentary evidence was sufficient  in  itself  to  justify
    such adverse findings. The judge did not ignore the oral  evidence.  He
    gave adequate reasons for finding that the oral evidence on the central
    issues in controversy (prior and current dependency) was not  credible.
    The  conclusion  which  he  reached  was  fully  open  to  him,  as  is
    illuminated by the case law cited in paragraphs 9 to 11 above.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not contain  an  error  of  law,
and so the decision stands.

I make no anonymity direction.
