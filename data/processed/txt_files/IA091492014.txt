                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS




     1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against a determination
        of First-tier Tribunal Judge Lagunju promulgated on 9th June  2014,
        following a hearing at Sheldon Court on 22nd May 2014, in which the
        Judge allowed the above Respondent's appeal against the refusal  of
        the Secretary of State to issue a Derivative Residence Card as  the
        primary carer of a British citizen resident in the United  Kingdom.
        The Judge found that the decision was 'not in accordance  with  the
        law' and allowed the appeal.


     2. The above Respondent is a citizen of India born on 5th  June  1981.
        The  Judge  set  out  her  findings  from  paragraph   8   of   the
        determination which can be summarised as follows:


     i.       In order to qualify for  a  derived  right  of  residence  the
   applicant must               show she is the  primary  carer  of  an  EEA
   national, under the age of            18, in the UK,  and  that  the  EEA
   national will be unable to remain in          the UK if the applicant  is
   required to leave. The  EEA  nationals                concerned  are  two
   minor children, aged one and two respectively at            the  date  of
   the  hearing,  who  are   both   said   to   be   British   citizens   by
   virtue of their  father's  status.  The  application  only  mentions  one
   child as  when  the  application  was  made  the  second  child  had  not
   been born [8].


     ii.      Regulation 15A(7) of the Immigration (European Economic  Area)
          Regulations  2006 (as amended) [the  EEA  Regulations]  defines  a
     primary carer as a direct relative with primary  responsibility  for  a
     person's care or who shares equally the responsibility of the  person's
          care with one who is not entitled to reside in the  UK.  Financial
          contribution alone does not amount to care or responsibility [8].


     iii.     The appellant relies upon the fact her husband works full time
   thus           is not at home during  the  day  and  accordingly  she  is
   responsible for              waking the children in the morning and their
   general day-to-day           care [9]. The youngest  child  has  a  cow's
   milk allergy and specific             dietary needs as result of which he
   is breastfed at mealtimes                  although  it  is  accepted  an
   alternative milk supplement has been          prescribed. The benefit  of
   the health and well-being of the youngest              child requires his
   mother to be on hand [10].


     iv.  Although the appellant accepts  her  husband  comes  home  in  the
   evenings after  work  and  interacts  with  the  children  this  involves
   playing  with  the  children  and  spending   time   with   them   before
   bedtime, and does not amount to primary care [11].


     v.       The appellant is the primary  carer  of  the  children,  is  a
   direct relative,             the children are under 18 and in the UK. The
   question is whether the               children will be unable  to  remain
   in the UK if the appellant were           required to leave [12].


     vi.  There is a strong bond between the primary carer for the  children
          and their mother.  As the children are British citizens and of the
                  Union it would not be reasonable to expect them  to  leave
   the UK and              be  deprived  of  various  benefits  attached  to
   British citizenship [13].


     vii. If they remain in their mother's absence they will be affected  by
              the separation. The specific needs of  the  child's  allergies
   would not           be properly met. For  this  reason  and  due  to  the
   father's work                commitments he will be unable  to  care  for
   them in the same way.
     3. Permission to appeal was sought by the Secretary of  State  on  the
        basis of an assertion the Judge materially misdirected  herself  in
        law in failing to correctly apply the provisions of Regulation  15A
        (4A) (c) of the 2006 Regulations.


     4. It is also asserted the Judge erred as the rights of  the  children
        will not be infringed if  they  are  not  compelled  to  leave  the
        territory of a member state such as would occur if there is another
        ascendant relative who has the right of residence in the EU and who
        can and will in practice care for the child.


     5. Permission was granted by another judge of the First-tier  Tribunal
        on the basis it was arguable the Judge approached the appeal  on  a
        simple premise that all the appellant had to establish was that she
        was the mother of a child who was a British citizen  and  that  her
        partner did not wish to give up his  employment  to  care  for  the
        child or to pay for childcare. It also said there is  no  reference
        in the determination to the guidance to be found in  relevant  case
        law.



Error of law


     6. It is accepted that the relevant regulation is  Regulation  15A  of
        the 2006 Regulations which deals with the issue of  derived  rights
        of residence. That states:


           15A. Derivative right of residence


          (1)     A person ("P")  who  is  not  an  exempt  person  and  who
   satisfies the                criteria in paragraph (2), (3), (4) [ , (4A)
   ] 3  or  (5)  of  this  regulation  is                    entitled  to  a
   derivative  right  to  reside  in  the  United  Kingdom   for   as   long
   as P satisfies the relevant criteria.


          (2)     P satisfies the criteria in this paragraph if-
              (a)      P is the primary  carer  of  an  EEA  national  ("the
   relevant EEA                     national"); and
              (b)      the relevant EEA national-


                  (i)  is under the age of 18;
                  (ii)     is residing in the  United  Kingdom  as  a  self-
   sufficient person;                    and
                  (iii)    would be unable to remain in the  United  Kingdom
   if P were                    required to leave.


          (3)     P satisfies the criteria in this paragraph if-


              (a)      P is the child of an EEA national ("the EEA  national
   parent");
              (b)      P resided in the United Kingdom at a  time  when  the
   EEA national                 parent was residing in the United Kingdom as
   a worker; and
              (c)      P is in education in the United Kingdom  and  was  in
   education there                  at a time when the EEA  national  parent
   was in the United Kingdom.


          (4)     P satisfies the criteria in this paragraph if-


              (a)      P is the  primary  carer  of  a  person  meeting  the
   criteria in paragraph                 (3) ("the relevant person"); and
              (b)      the relevant person would be unable to continue to be
   educated in                  the United Kingdom if  P  were  required  to
   leave.
          (4A)    P satisfies the criteria in this paragraph if-


              (a)      P is the primary carer of  a  British  citizen  ("the
   relevant British                      citizen");
              (b)      the relevant  British  citizen  is  residing  in  the
   United Kingdom; and
              (c)      the relevant  British  citizen  would  be  unable  to
   reside in the UK  or  in                 another  EEA  State  if  P  were
   required to leave.
          (5)     P satisfies the criteria in this paragraph if-


              (a)      P is under the age of 18;
              (b)      P's primary carer is entitled to a  derivative  right
   to  reside  in  the                       United  Kingdom  by  virtue  of
   paragraph (2) or (4);
              (c)      P does not have leave to enter,  or  remain  in,  the
   United Kingdom;                  and
              (d)      requiring P to leave the United Kingdom would prevent
   P's primary                  carer from residing in the United Kingdom.
          (6)     For the purpose of this regulation-


              (a)      "education" excludes nursery education;
              (b)      "worker" does not include a jobseeker or a person who
   falls to be                  regarded as a worker by virtue of regulation
   6(2); and
              (c)      "an exempt person"is a person-
                  (i)  who has a right to reside in the United Kingdom as  a
   result of                    any other provision of these Regulations;
                  (ii)     who has a right of abode in the United Kingdom by
   virtue of                    section 2 of the 1971 Act;
                  (iii)    to whom section 8 of the 1971 Act, or  any  order
   made  under                        subsection  (2)  of  that   provision,
   applies; or
                  (iv) who has indefinite leave to enter or  remain  in  the
   United                           Kingdom.


          (7)     P is to be regarded as a "primary carer" of another person
   if


                  (a)  P is a direct relative or a legal  guardian  of  that
   person; and
                  (b) P-
                       (i)      is the person who has primary responsibility
   for that                              person's care; or
                       (ii)     shares equally the responsibility  for  that
   person's care                         with one other person who is not an
   exempt person.
          (7A)    Where P is to be regarded as a primary  carer  of  another
   person by virtue             of  paragraph  (7)(b)(ii)  the  criteria  in
   paragraphs  (2)(b)(iii),  (4)(b)  and                  (4A)(c)  shall  be
   considered on the basis that both P and the person with              whom
   care responsibility is shared would be required to leave the United
              Kingdom.
          (7B)    Paragraph (7A) does not apply if the person with whom care
                       responsibility is shared acquired a derivative  right
   to reside in  the  United                Kingdom  as  a  result  of  this
   regulation      prior      to      P      assuming       equal       care
   responsibility.
          (8)     P will not be regarded  as  having  responsibility  for  a
   person's care for the            purpose of paragraph  (7)  on  the  sole
   basis of a financial contribution                  towards that  person's
   care.
          (9)     A person who otherwise satisfies the criteria in paragraph
   (2), (3), (4), (4A)               or  (5)  will  not  be  entitled  to  a
   derivative right to reside in the United               Kingdom where  the
   Secretary of State has made a  decision  under                 regulation
   19(3)(b), 20(1) or 20A(1).


     7. Regulation 15A(4A) came into force on the  8th  November  2012  and
        contains the criteria the above Respondent was required to show she
        is able to meet which are that (a) she is the primary  carer  of  a
        British citizen ("the relevant British citizen"); (b) the  relevant
        British citizen is residing in the United Kingdom; and     (c)  the
        relevant British citizen would be unable to reside in the UK or  in
        another EEA State if the above Respondent were required to leave.


     8. On behalf the Secretary of State it was submitted that rather  than
        focus upon the required test the Judge conflated the residence card
        application with an application requiring consideration of  section
        55 or Article 8  ECHR.  It  was  submitted  the  Judge  misdirected
        herself in law as the question is not whether it was reasonable  to
        expect a child to leave the United Kingdom but whether there was no
        option other than for the child to leave. The Secretary of  State's
        refusal does not mean there is a requirement or compulsion to  take
        the British citizen children out of the UK the fact  it  may  be  '
        inconvenient' to their father to  have  to  rearrange  his  working
        conditions does not mean that the necessary test is met.


     9. On the behalf of the above Respondent it  was  submitted  that  the
        evidence from the children's father was that he would be unable  to
        care for them as a result of his  work  commitments;  although  was
        also accepted that  if  he  gave  up  his  work  or  possibly  made
        alternative arrangements for the childcare he would be able  to  do
        so.


    10. There is arguable merit in the  submission  the  Judge  misdirected
        herself in law or appears to have asked herself the wrong  question
        or, if the right  question,  to  have  answered  it  an  irrational
        manner, such that the determination  must  be  set  aside  and  the
        decision re-made.



Discussion



    11. The authority to which the Judge appears to have given no  relevant
        consideration is that of MA & SM (Zambrano; EU children outside  EU
        Iran) [2013] UKUT 380 it was held that (i) EU law terms there is no
        reason why the decision in  Zambrano  could  not  in  principle  be
        relied upon by the parent, or other primary carer, of  a  minor  EU
        national living outside the EU as long as it is  the  intention  of
        the parent, or primary carer, to accompany the EU national child to
        his/her country of nationality, in the instant appeals  that  being
        the United  Kingdom.  To  conclude  otherwise  would  deny  access,
        without justification, to a whole class of EU  citizens  to  rights
        they are entitled to by virtue of their citizenship (ii) The  above
        conclusion is fortified by the terms of The  Immigration  (European
        Economic Area) (Amendment) (No.2) Regulations 2012 (SI  2012/2560),
        brought into force on 8 November 2012. Paragraphs 2 and  3  of  the
        Schedule to the Regulations give effect to the CJEU's  decision  in
        Zambrano by amending regulations 11  and  15A  of  the  Immigration
        (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 in order to confer rights
        of entry and residence on the primary carer of  a  British  citizen
        who is joining the British citizen in, or accompanying the  British
        citizen to [regulations 11(5)(e) and 15A(4A)], the  United  Kingdom
        and where the denial of such a right of residence would prevent the
        British citizen from being able to reside in the United Kingdom  or
        in an EEA State.


    12. It was specifically found by the Tribunal in that case:




              40. The CJEU's decision  in  Zambrano  has  subsequently  been
considered in a                 number  of  other  decisions  of  the  CJEU:
McCarthy v  Secretary  of  State  for  the                  Home  Department

Department [2012] EWCA Civ 1736.

              41. Hickinbottom J  recently  had  occasion  to  consider  the
abovementioned                  authorities in his decision in Jamil  Sanneh
v (1) Secretary of State for Work                and Pensions  and  (2)  The
Commissioners  for  Her  Majesty's  Revenue  and                     Customs
[2013]   EWHC   793   (Admin);    summarising    the    learning    to    be
derived from them, which we  respectfully  agree  with  and  adopt,  in  the
         following terms:

             i)   All nationals of all member states are EU citizens. It is
        for each member            state to determine  how  nationality  of
        that state may be acquired, but, once             it is acquired by
        an  individual,  that  individual  has  the  right  to  enjoy   the
        substance of the rights that attach to the status  of  EU  citizen,
        including the              right to reside in the territory of  the
        EU. That applies equally to minors,                irrespective  of
        the nationality of  their  parents,  and  irrespective  of  whether
        one or both parents have EU citizenship.


             ii)  An EU citizen must have the freedom to enjoy the right to
        reside in the EU,          genuinely and in practice. For a  minor,
        that freedom may be jeopardised if,               although  legally
        entitled to  reside  in  the  EU,  he  is  compelled  to  leave  EU
        territory because an ascendant relative upon whom he  is  dependent
        is            compelled to leave. That relative may be compelled to
        leave by dint of           direct state  action  (e.g.  he  is  the
        subject of an order for removal) or by virtue              of being
        driven to leave  and  reside  in  a  non-EU  country  by  force  of
         economic necessity  (e.g.  by  having  insufficient  resources  to
        provide for his            EU child(ren) because the state  refuses
        him a work permit). The rights of an              EU child will not
        be  infringed  if  he  is  not  compelled  to   leave.   Therefore,
        even where a non-EU ascendant relative is  compelled  to  leave  EU
        territory,             the article 20 rights of an  EU  child  will
        not  be  infringed  if  there  is  another                ascendant
        relative who has the right of residence in  the  EU,  and  who  can
         and will in practice care for the child.


             iii)     It is for the national  courts  to  determine,  as  a
        question  of  fact  on  the                   evidence  before  it,
        whether  an  EU  citizen  would   be   compelled   to   leave   the
        EU to follow a non-EU national upon whom he is dependent.


             iv)  Nothing less than such compulsion will engage articles 20
        and 21 of the              TFEU. In particular, EU law will not  be
        engaged where the EU  citizen  is  not                compelled  to
        leave the EU, even if the quality or standard of  life  of  the  EU
         citizen is diminished as a result of the non-EU national upon whom
        he is              dependent is (for example) removed or  prevented
        from working; although              (a) diminution in  the  quality
        of life might engage EU law if (and only  if)                it  is
        sufficient in practice to compel the a relevant ascendant relative,
        and           hence the EU dependent citizen,  to  leave,  and  (b)
        such actions as  removal              or  prevention  of  work  may
        result in an interference with some other right,           such  as
        the right to respect  for  family  life  under  article  8  of  the
        European           Convention on Human Rights.


             v)   Although such article 8 rights are similar  in  scope  to
        the EU rights                    conferred  by  article  7  of  the
        Charter of Fundamental Rights of the  European               Union,
        the provisions of the Charter are addressed to member  states  only
         when they are implementing EU law. If EU law is not engaged,  then
        the           domestic courts have to undertake the examination  of
        the right to family             life under article 8; but  that  is
        an entirely distinct area of protection.


             vi)  The overriding of the general national right to refuse  a
        non-EU national a          right of residence, by reference to  the
        effective enjoyment of  the  right  to                reside  of  a
        dependent EU citizen, is described in both  Dereci  (paragraph  67)
          and  Harrison  (paragraph  66)  as  "exceptional",  meaning   (as
        explained in the           latter), as a principle, it will not  be
        regularly engaged.


    13. At paragraph 56, applying  the  correct  legal  principles  to  the
        second appellant before the Tribunal it found:


              56. There is no suggestion that the sponsor is not capable  of
   looking after JM                 and FM.  He  has  tailored  his  working
   hours thus far to ensure that they fit                 in with  the  need
   to   care   for   JM,   and   we   have   no   doubt   he   would    also
   ensure that FM was similarly cared for. There mere fact that the  sponsor
              cannot be as economically active as he would wish, because  of
   his care                responsibilities to JM and FM, is not  sufficient
   to support a conclusion that                  JM and FM would  be  denied
   the  genuine  enjoyment  of  their  EU                        citizenship
   rights,  nor  would  this  be  the  case  even  if   the   sponsor   were
   required to stop working altogether. The right of residence is a right to
                  reside in the territory of the EU. It is not  a  right  to
   any particular quality  of                  life  or  to  any  particular
   standard   of   living    (see    Dereci    at    paragraph    68,    and
   Harrison at paragraph 67).


    14. In DH (Jamaica) and others v SSHD [2012] EWCA Civ 1736 the Court of
        Appeal said that the application of the Zambrano  test  required  a
        focus on whether, as a matter of reality, the EU citizen  would  be
        obliged to give up residence in the EU if the non-EU  national  was
        removed. If the EU citizen, be it  wife  or  child,  would  not  in
        practice be compelled to leave the country  if  the  non-EU  family
        member were to be refused the right of residence, there was nothing
        in the jurisprudence to suggest that EU law would be engaged simply
        because their continuing residence was in some sense affected,  for
        example, in relation to the quality of life. The right of residence
        was a right  to  reside  in  the  territory  not  a  right  to  any
        particular quality of life or particular  standard  of  living  and
        only if that was affected to such an extent that it was  likely  to
        compel the EU citizen to leave would the principle apply.


    15. There is no challenge to  the  finding  the  above  Respondent  has
        primary-care of the British citizen children or  that  the  British
        citizen children are residing in  the  United  Kingdom.  These  are
        preserved findings. What is not established on the evidence is that
        as a result of  the  Secretary  of  State's  decision  the  British
        citizen children will be unable to reside in the United Kingdom  or
        in another EU state if the above Respondent was required to  leave.
        The children live with their British national father too and it has
        not been  shown  that  he  will  be  unable  to  meet  their  needs
        notwithstanding  the  role  that  has  been  played  by  the  above
        Respondent to date, if she was not able to continue  to  do  so.  A
        lack of willingness to care for his children is different  from  an
        inability  to  care  for  them  and  this  element  has  not   been
        established on the evidence. As it has not  been  established  that
        the children would have to leave the United Kingdom or  another  EU
        state the requirements of regulation 15A(4A)(c) have not been shown
        to be met and neither has European law been  shown  to  be  engaged
        and/or breached on the facts. On this basis only  the  appeal  must
        fail.


    16. The submissions made by Mr Mills referred to consideration  of  the
        children's best interests, under  the  Immigration  Rules,  and  in
        relation to an Article 8 claim. This was an element  raised  as  an
        issue before the First-tier Tribunal but which the Judge failed  to
        adequately consider or make a specific finding upon.


    17. There is a divergence of opinion regarding  whether  in  an  appeal
        against a refusal to issue a residence card Article 8 is engaged or
        can be argued.  The Secretary of State's position is that it is not
        as this is not a decision which  will  result  in  an  individual's
        removal from the United Kingdom but a refusal to confer a  document
        reflecting an individual's status under  the  Regulations.  In  the
        case of Bee and another  (permanent/derived  rights  of  residence)
        [2013] UKUT 83 a Tribunal composed of Mr Justice Blake  and  Deputy
        Upper Tribunal  Judge  Farrelly  considered  an  appeal  against  a
        decision of a judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal  who  allowed  the
        appeal against a refusal to issue confirmation  of  entitlement  to
        permanently reside in the United Kingdom by virtue of European law.
         It was found on the fact that this  decision  was  erroneous.   In
        relation to Article 8 ECHR the Tribunal found at  paragraph  43  of
        the determination:


              43. ............The case was not concerned with refusal  of  a
   visa but the                 grant of permanent residence; there  was  no
   free standing human                   rights point before the judge as no
   immigration decision had been                 made  under  s.82  NIAA  as
   noted above; no submissions had been               advanced to the  judge
   that the EEA decision was in breach of human                rights and no
   reasons    were    given    by    the    judge    for    the    decision.
   Human rights are not an issue for determination before us.


    18. Section 82 Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002  specifies
        when a right of appeal will arise, which  is  when  in  immigration
        decision is made in respect of a person who may then appeal to  the
        Tribunal.  An 'immigration decision' is defined in section  82  (2)
        which does not include a decision under the 2006 Regulations.


    19. Appeal rights against a decision taken under the  Regulations,  the
        EEA decision, or provided for in Regulation 26.  Regulation 26  (6)
        stating that except where an appeal  lies  to  the  Commission,  an
        appeal under these Regulations applies to the First-tier  Tribunal.
        Regulation 26 (7) states that the provisions made  under  the  2002
        Act referred to in Schedule 1 shall have effect for the purposes of
        an appeal under these Regulations to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  in
        accordance with that schedule.


    20. Schedule 1 states:


              1.  The following provisions of, or made under, the  2002  Act
   have  effect                   in  relation  to  an  appeal  under  these
   Regulations to the First-tier                      Tribunal as if it were
   an appeal against an immigration decision                   under section
   82 (1) of that Act :


                  Section 84 (1), except paragraphs (a) and (f);


                  Section 85 to 87;


                  Section 105 and any regulations made under  that  section;
   and


                  Section 106 and any rules made under that section.


              2.  Tribunal  procedure  rules  have  effect  in  relation  to
   appeals under                these Regulations.


    21. Section 84 sets out in the available grounds of appeal  from  which
        is omitted the ground that the decision is not in  accordance  with
        the immigration rules (s.84 (1)(a)) and that the person taking  the
        decision should have exercised differently a  discretion  conferred
        by the immigration rules (s.84 (1) (f).  Section 85 to 87 deal with
        matters to be considered, determination of appeal, and a  direction
        made upon a successful appeal. Section 105 relates to the giving of
        a  notice  of  immigration  decision  and  section  106  provisions
        relating to the Rules.


    22. Section 84(1)(c) specifies that  the  decision  is  unlawful  under
        section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998 (public authority not to act
        contrary to Human Rights Convention) as being incompatible with the
        appellant's Convention rights.  This is not an  excluded  provision
        within the Schedule 1 to the Regulations.


    23. It appears, therefore, that notwithstanding the fact that a refusal
        to issue a Residence Card with  no  freestanding  consideration  of
        Article 8 is not  an  immigration  decision  for  the  purposes  of
        section 82, according to the definition of the same to be found  in
        the statute, Schedule 1 to the Regulations means that the  relevant
        provisions of the 2002 Act, including section 84, shall have effect
        in relation to appeal  under  the  Regulations  to  the  First-tier
        Tribunal as if it were an appeal against  an  immigration  decision
        under section 82(1).


    24. Section 86 of the 2002 Act requires the Tribunal to  determine  any
        matter raised as a ground of appeal (whether or not  by  virtue  of
        section 85 (1)) and any matter which  section  85  requires  it  to
        consider. In this appeal Article 8 ECHR was raised as a  ground  of
        appeal and was not properly considered and has not been  determined
        by the First-tier Tribunal.


    25. The conclusion of  the  Upper  Tribunal  is,  therefore,  that  the
        decision to allow the appeal by  reference  to  Regulation  15A  is
        infected by material legal error which has resulted in this  aspect
        of the case being set aside and the decision remade to dismiss this
        head of appeal on the basis that the specific requirements referred
        to above cannot be met.  In relation to the extant ground  relating
        to Article 8 ECHR, this is remitted to the First-tier  Tribunal  to
        be considered by a salaried judge of that Tribunal nominated by the
        Resident Judge at which hearing, if the Secretary of State  is  not
        in agreement with the above analysis of  the  relevant  provisions,
        proper argument may be raised relating to the jurisdiction  of  the
        First-tier Tribunal to consider Article 8 and,  if  established  or
        accepted, the merits of the Article  8  claim  itself  following  a
        proper analysis of the competing claims of the parties.


Decision

    26. The First-tier Tribunal Judge materially erred in law. I set  aside
        the decision of the  original  Judge.  I  remake  the  decision  as
        follows. This appeal is dismissed under the  EEA  Regulations.  The
        appeal under Article 8 ECHR is remitted to the First-tier  Tribunal
        sitting at Birmingham as a decision upon the same is still awaited.




   Anonymity.


    27. The First-tier Tribunal did not make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
        45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
        2005. I make not such order pursuant to rule  14  of  the  Tribunal
        Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008).
