                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. This appeal has its origins  in  a  decision  made  on  behalf  of  the
    Secretary of State for the Home Department (the "Secretary of  State"),
    dated 12 November 2014, whereby the  applications  of  the  Appellants,
    nationals of Pakistan, for leave to remain in the United Kingdom in the
    capacity of Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant were refused.  Their  ensuing
    appeals to the First-tier Tribunal (the "FtT") were dismissed.

The impugned decisions

 2. In refusing the Appellants' aforesaid applications,  the  Secretary  of
    State awarded zero points in respect of the "attributes" of  (a)  funds
    held in regulated financial institutions and (b)  funds  disposable  in
    the United Kingdom.  In the decision letter in the case of  Mr  Nadeem,
    the issue of the "viability and credibility of the source of the money"
    was  considered  and  reference  was  made  to  an  interview  of  this
    Appellant.  This gave rise to the following conclusion:

         "Therefore from the evidence provided  and  the  answers  given  at
         interview, I am not satisfied how you have obtained your  share  of
         the �50,000.  The discrepancies  provided  at  interview  questions
         [sic] the source of income and your viability  and  credibility  of
         any intentions to invest the �50,000 into a business in the  United
         Kingdom."

    The decision maker then turned to consider the issue of the  "viability
    and credibility of the applicant's business plans and  market  research
    into their chosen business sectors".

    Having rehearsed certain aspects of the documentary  evidence,  coupled
    with  answers  provided  in  interview,  the  decision  maker   further
    concluded thus:

         "Therefore, from the evidence  provided,  the  discrepancy  of  the
         answers given at interview along with  the  lack  of  any  feasible
         evidence to support your trading activity, I am not satisfied  with
         the viability and credibility of your  business  plans  and  market
         research into your chosen business sector which  outlines  concerns
         over the genuineness of your business."

3.   The decision letter contains a third conclusion:

         "Therefore I cannot be satisfied that during your period  of  Post-
         Study leave you have undertaken genuine and credible steps to  make
         preparation for planning, launching and developing a business  idea
         in the United  Kingdom  and  that  you  have  gained  the  relevant
         experience necessary to assist you in the day to day running  of  a
         business."

    The omnibus conclusion was expressed in the following terms:

         "Based on  the  above  consideration  the  Secretary  of  State  is
         therefore  refusing  your  application   because   you   have   not
         satisfactorily demonstrated that you are a genuine entrepreneur, as
         set out at paragraph 245 DD(h) ..."

    The refusal decision in the case of the other Appellant, Mr Masud,  was
    couched in materially indistinguishable terms.

Decision of the FtT

4.   We have considered this in conjunction with the grant of permission  to
    appeal.       The Judge stated, in [59]:

         "... It is recognised  by  and  is  part  of  the  Rules  that  the
         assessment of the genuineness of  the  intentions  of  the  parties
         regarding  this  money  [�50,000]  and  whether  it  is   genuinely
         available  involves  taking  into   account   the   viability   and
         credibility of the source of the money."

    The Judge then observed that the mere production of "a bank letter  and
    statement showing the amount in excess of �50,000 standing in the joint
    account" did not necessarily satisfy the requirements of the Rules.  In
    the same context, he commented that "... it is not a case of subjecting
    the finances stated to be available  to  an  audit  or  other  forensic
    accounting mechanism ..."

5.   In the ensuing passages, the  Judge  made  the  following  observations
    and/or findings:

      a) There were  several  significant  deposits  in  the  relevant  bank
         account which the  second  Appellant,  Mr  Nadeem,  had  failed  to
         explain.  This "... gives rise to serious concerns that the funding
         was genuinely his  own  and  available  for  the  purposes  of  the
         business".

      b) While Mr Nadeem had claimed in  interview  that  he  was  not  then
         employed, this cast a shadow over three  specific  credits  to  his
         bank account, totalling over �3,000.

      c) Mr Nadeem's claim that he had  saved  some  �20,000  from  earnings
         since his arrival in the United Kingdom  was  not,  duly  analysed,
         credible.

    Having  conducted  this  analysis,  the  Judge   made   the   following
    conclusion:

         "I do not find ...  that  the  second  Appellant  [Mr  Nadeem]  has
         established on the  balance  of  probabilities  that  he  genuinely
         intended to invest [the requisite finances] ...  in  the  business,
         that the money ... was genuinely available to him and would  remain
         available to him until such time as it was spent for  the  purposes
         of his business and that he did not intend to  take  employment  in
         the United Kingdom other than under the terms of paragraph  245  DE
         of the Rules."

    Founding on this conclusion, the Judge  decided  that  Mr  Nadeem  (the
    second Appellant) did  not  meet  the  requirements  of  paragraph  245
    DD(h)(ii)(iii)  of  the  Rules  and  paragraph  245  DD(b).    As   the
    application was a joint one, this meant that the appeal  of  the  first
    Appellant must necessarily fail also.

6.   The essence of the grant of  permission  to  appeal  to  this  Tribunal
    emerges in the following passage:

         "In fact, the Appellants had explained in their witness statements,
         at interview with the Respondent and in evidence  at  the  hearing,
         the precise source of the �50,000.  They exhibited to their witness
         statements  and  their  appeal  bundle  various   bank   statements
         evidencing  the  transfer  of  their  respective  contributions  of
         �25,000 from their own individual bank accounts  into  their  joint
         business bank account.  The Respondent  had  chosen  not  to  cross
         examine either of the Appellants upon the banking entries  or  upon
         the bank statements, neither did the Judge raise  any  question  of
         either Appellant as to the bank statements or the entries."

    Continuing, the permission Judge notes the suggestion  that  the  Judge
    impermissibly  traversed  the  boundary  separating   adversarial   and
    inquisitorial proceedings.  The linked complaint that the findings were
    not open to the Judge (ie were irrational) on the basis of the evidence
    is noted.  The arguable procedural unfairness of the  Judge's  decision
    is also acknowledged. Permission to appeal was granted accordingly.

Consideration and Conclusions

 7. The grant of permission to appeal  raises  a  clear  issue  as  to  the
    fairness of the hearing conducted by the FtT and its  overall  decision
    making process.  In several recent decisions this  Tribunal  has  given
    consideration to some of  the  fair  hearing  issues  arising  in  this
    appeal. The question of law raised in appeals of this genre is  whether
    there has been any infringement of  the  litigant's  right  to  a  fair
    hearing.  In deciding this question, regard must always be had  to  the
    important contextual matters of the terms of the Secretary  of  State's
    decision, the manner in which the parties joined issue before the  FtT,
    the issues which were expressly in contention between  the  parties  in
    that forum and the focus of any cross examination of the appellant.  We
    emphasise that this does not purport to  be  an  exhaustive  list.   In
    making our decision, we have taken all of these factors into account.

 8. We would highlight in particular, as noted in the grant  of  permission
    to appeal, the absence of any cross examination of the Appellants  upon
    certain issues, the parallel  lack  of  judicial  questioning  and  the
    failure to engage  properly  with  the  explanations  provided  by  the
    Appellants in their witness  statements  and  when  interviewed.   This
    combination of factors impels  to  the  conclusion  that  the  decision
    making process of the FtT is vitiated by procedural unfairness.

 9. We are also concerned that the FtT gave consideration to evidence which
    should have been excluded  under  section  85(a)  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and  did  so  in  a  manner  which  was
    adverse to the  Appellants.  This  discrete  error  of  law  has  mixed
    elements of misdirection and procedural unfairness.

10. In the circumstances it is unnecessary to probe the further element  of
    the grant of permission to appeal noted in [6] above.  The decision  of
    the FtT cannot survive and must be set aside.

11. One further issue identified by the panel as  arising  in  this  appeal
    focuses on the distinction between requirements in the Rules  involving
    bright line answers and evaluative judgements by  decision  makers.  In
    contrast,  Rules  requirements  which  involve  the  formation  of   an
    evaluative judgement on the  part  of  the  decision  maker  are  of  a
    different species.  Given the decision which we  have  reached,  it  is
    unnecessary to explore  this  interesting  legal  issue  further.   The
    opportunity for the Upper Tribunal to provide more  extensive  guidance
    will doubtless arise in some future case.  At this juncture, we  simply
    alert the FtT to the importance of being cognisant of the distinction.

Decision

12.  We decide and direct:

      a) The decision of the FtT is set aside.

      b) We remit the appeal to a different  constitution  of  the  FtT  for
         rehearing and fresh decision.

      c) The remittal is to Bradford.

      d) An early case management review should be convened.
