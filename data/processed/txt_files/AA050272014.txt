                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal (Judge Coll) sitting at Taylor House on 23 February
    2015, dismissing his appeal against the decision of  the  Secretary  of
    State to refuse  to  recognise  him  as  a  refugee,  or  as  otherwise
    requiring international or human rights  protection,  and  against  her
    concomitant decision to remove him as an illegal entrant/person subject
    to administrative removal under  Section  10  of  the  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 1999, his asylum claim having been  refused.   Although  the
    First-tier Tribunal did not make an  anonymity  direction,  I  consider
    that the appellant should be accorded anonymity for  these  proceedings
    in the Upper Tribunal in view of the nature of his case.

The Grant of Permission to Appeal

 2. On 17 April  2015  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Nicholson  granted  the
    appellant permission to appeal for the following reasons:

         "2.  Ground 1 contends that the judge erred in failing to allow the
             appeal  on  the  basis  of  the  Discretionary  Leave  policy.
             According to the application, the policy states that those who
             have been granted discretionary leave before 9 July 2012  will
             normally continue to be dealt with under the policy through to
             settlement if they qualify for it (normally after  accruing  6
             years continuous DL).

         3.   The appellant, who was born  on  4  March  1996,  was  granted
             discretionary leave as an unaccompanied minor from 15 December
             2008 until 15 December 2011.  He made an in  time  application
             for further leave on 8 December 2011.  It was not until 3 July
             2014 that the respondent refused  the  application,  by  which
             time the appellant was over 18 and not entitled to  a  further
             grant of discretionary leave.

         4.   At paragraph 73 of the decision, the  judge  stated  that  the
             delay was irrelevant because,  if  the  application  had  been
             dealt with in a timely fashion, the appellant would only  have
             been granted discretionary leave up to the  age  of  seventeen
             and a half, at which point he would have accrued just under  5
             years discretionary leave so he would not have  been  able  to
             make an application for settlement at that time.

         5.   It is the appellant's case, however, as I understand it,  that
             the appellant's discretionary leave  granted  on  15  December
             2008 was extended by statute under section 3C of the 1971  Act
             when he submitted his application on 8 December 2011 and  that
             that discretionary leave was continuing under  section  3C  at
             the date of the hearing,  by  which  time  the  appellant  had
             accrued the necessary 6 years leave.

         6.   That is not quite how the skeleton  argument  put  it  to  the
             judge and that argument would not help the appellant establish
             that the respondent's decision was not in accordance with  the
             law because the relevant date for deciding that issue was  the
             date of decision (see CW (Jamaica) v SSHD 2013 EWCA Civ  915),
             at which point the appellant had not accrued the  necessary  6
             years leave.

         7.    Nonetheless,  despite  the  apparent  sense  in  the  judge's
             comments, depending on the terms of the actual policy,  it  is
             arguable that, where more than 6  years  leave  (discretionary
             leave extended by statute) had accrued  by  the  date  of  the
             hearing, that was  a  relevant  factor  for  the  purposes  of
             article 8.  Permission is accordingly granted on  this  issue,
             although the appellant's representatives will need to file and
             serve a complete copy of the  policy  relied  on.   I  do  not
             refuse permission on the remaining grounds."

The Rule 24 Response

3.   On 6 May 2015 Mr Avery of the Specialist Appeals Team  settled  a  Rule
    24  response  on  behalf  of  the  Secretary  of  State  opposing   the
    appellant's appeal:

         "2.  The respondent opposes the appellant's  appeal.   In  summary,
             the respondent will submit inter alia that the  judge  of  the
             First-tier Tribunal directed himself appropriately.

         3.   From the comments of Judge Nicholson  who  granted  permission
             (para 6) it does not seem that the argument now being advanced
             was put to Judge Coll at  the  FTT  hearing  it  is  therefore
             somewhat disingenuous to now say it was an error  of  law  for
             the judge not to consider it.  Furthermore it is  not  at  all
             clear that the appropriate Home  Office  guidance  upon  which
             this argument is said to be based was before him either.

         4.   The Secretary of State does not accept that time spent  on  3c
             statutory  leave  counts  as  'discretionary  leave'  for  the
             purposes   of   calculating   the   residence    requirements,
             particularly where the application giving rise to 3c leave  is
             refused.  Furthermore the unaccompanied  minors  policy  is  a
             specific discretionary leave policy  which  the  Secretary  of
             State does not accept counts for the purposes of the grant  of
             residence under the general discretionary policy, particularly
             in a case where the appellant, under the unaccompanied  minors
             policy, could never have met that requirement."

The Factual Background

 3. The appellant is a national of Sri Lanka, whose date  of  birth  is  14
    March 1996.  He claimed asylum on 31 October 2008.  He said he had been
    brought by a family to the UK four days earlier, and had entered  on  a
    false passport.  At his screening interview, he said  his  journey  had
    been arranged and paid for by his uncle.  He was  of  Tamil  ethnicity,
    and before he left Sri Lanka he had been living with his mother,  step-
    father and step-brother in Jaffna district, where he had intermittently
    attended the local school.  His family had long suffered as a result of
    internecine ethnic violence in Sri Lanka, and he was unable to  lead  a
    normal  life.   All  this  caused  him  great  anxiety,  and  when  his
    nightmares became worse, his mother had decided to send him to  a  safe
    country.  After being taken to Colombo  by  a  family  friend,  he  was
    handed over to a family of four who told him that they  were  going  to
    take him to an uncle in Switzerland and told them to  pretend  that  he
    was part of their family.  Although it was his  understanding  that  he
    was going to be taken to Switzerland, upon his arrival  in  the  United
    Kingdom, he was told that there had been a problem obtaining a visa for
    that country.  He said the family that accompanied him took  him  to  a
    house to rest before phoning his uncle  in  Switzerland  and  receiving
    instructions to take him to Mrs J, whom he now referred to as his aunt.



 4. The appellant's application for asylum was refused on 15 December 2008,
    but he was granted limited leave to remain in  the  United  Kingdom  in
    accordance  with  the  published   Home   Office   asylum   policy   on
    discretionary  leave,  as  it  had  been  concluded  that  he  had  not
    established any reason why he would be eligible for  such  a  grant  of
    limited leave to remain beyond him being  an  unaccompanied  child  for
    whom  the  Home  Office  was  not  satisfied  that  adequate  reception
    arrangements in the country of return existed.

 5. On 30 July 2009 Samantha Morgan and Sarah Rance, both  psychotherapists
    at East London NHS Foundation  Trust,  submitted  a  report  about  the
    appellant to his GP.  He had been referred on 3 February 2009.  The  GP
    described a history of trauma back in Sri Lanka, including  the  murder
    of his father, and said that T was currently  presenting  as  withdrawn
    and had  difficulties  in  concentrating.   He  had  now  completed  an
    extended assessment over eight sessions.

 6. T had been brought by his "aunt" and carer, Mrs J, a  family  relative,
    with whom T now lived, along with her two children.  She reported  that
    T had nightmares, and that he also  could  present  as  quite  anxious.
    Both of them also reported that T  had  been  bullied  at  school.   It
    seemed that T was having  enormous  difficulties  in  trying  to  learn
    English as well as adjusting to a new educational  system.   When  they
    first met, T presented as an enthusiastic boy, who  was  hopeful  about
    his future and his ability to do well in school.  But during the course
    of the assessment, they  were  concerned  to  see  that  T's  mood  had
    significantly lowered.  By the end of the period  of  assessment,  they
    were pleased to find that there had been  significant  improvements  in
    T's mood since the earlier concerns in May and June 2009.

 7. They had met T's head of year on 1 July 2009, and she expressed concern
    about the bullying that T had experienced  at  school,  as  well  as  a
    request for more formal and active support for T to learn English.

 8. The appellant's discretionary leave ran until 15  December  2011.   The
    appellant made an in-time application for further leave to remain.  The
    application was made with the assistance of S. Satha  &  Co,  who  sent
    chasing  letters  and  also  provided  the  Home  Office  with  updated
    information about the appellant's educational progress.  On  23  August
    2012 they wrote to  the  Home  Office  about  the  appellant's  current
    studies in the UK, and on 23 January 2013 they enclosed copies  of  the
    appellant's GCSE results for 2011 and 2012, along with certificates and
    ICT from OCR.  They informed the Home Office he was now doing A levels.
     He had turned out to be a very enterprising person and  had  used  his
    stay to great advantage.

 9. On 22 August 2012 Sarah Rance wrote  to  Elaine  Campbell,  the  social
    worker on the Safeguarding and  Assessment  Team  responsible  for  the
    appellant, detailing her current concerns about the appellant, his aunt
    and her children.  The current safeguarding  concerns  were  about  the
    deterioration in T's relationship with his aunt by marriage, with  whom
    he lived.  There was an incident during which she pushed him out of the
    front door of the house, approximately ten days  ago.   Her  ill-health
    meant that she relied quite considerably on T to help out at home  with
    domestic tasks and care of the younger children.  This has  not  always
    been easy for T and there had inevitably been some tensions.  Mrs J may
    well be suffering also from symptoms of PTSD  because  of  her  abusive
    relationship  with  her  children's  father,  which  included  physical
    violence.

10. T had settled into school, but had found it  difficult  to  make  close
    friendships  and  had  suffered  from  some  bullying,  both   racially
    motivated and  because  he  suffered  from  bad  acne.   Despite  these
    difficulties his English had come on extremely well since  his  arrival
    and he was a very hardworking student.

11. In a letter dated 23 October 2012 Sarah Rance explained why it was  not
    suitable for T to  continue  living  with  his  aunt.   He  was  living
    thousands of miles from his mother and younger brother, who he had  not
    seen since arrival in the UK in 2008, though he maintained  contact  by
    telephone.  He was a socially  isolated  and  vulnerable  young  person
    living in a very unhappy intense situation with his aunt  and  cousins.
    Because of the impact of his  aunt's  ill-health  and  his  own  mental
    health development, she was of the firm opinion that  T  needed  to  be
    moved from living with his aunt, and  to  be  cared  for  in  a  foster
    placement, ideally with two  parental  figures.   Appropriate  parental
    care was needed to help address the gaps  left  by  the  death  of  his
    father and separation from his mother.   To  push  him  into  premature
    independence at this stage in his development would be  detrimental  to
    his present and future mental health.

12. On 14 September 2013 Stephen Timms MP wrote a letter on the appellant's
    behalf to the Home Office (Immigration)  MP's  Liaison  Unit  reporting
    that the appellant had come to his advice surgery that morning.  He was
    currently being supported by Newham Social Services  and  had  recently
    moved to an address in East Ham (which  was  not  the  address  of  his
    aunt).  Despite requests to expedite his case, he was still waiting for
    a decision to be made on his application for an extension of leave.  He
    was  currently  studying  A  level  maths  and  a  BTEC  Level   3   in
    Construction.  He had told the MP that he wished to  move  into  higher
    education to study architecture.

13. On 3 July 2014 the Secretary of State gave her reasons for refusing  to
    grant the appellant further  leave  to  remain.   He  had  submitted  a
    medical report from Newham Child and Family Consultation Service.   The
    report stated he had received treatment  for  PTSD  and  low  mood  and
    anxiety.  He did not  claim  to  be  taking  any  medication  for  this
    condition.  There was no provision within the Immigration Rules  for  a
    person to be granted leave to remain  in  the  UK  to  receive  medical
    treatment on the NHS.  It was accepted that he had been diagnosed  with
    PTSD, but it was not accepted his removal from the UK would amount to a
    breach of Article 3 (medical).  The Secretary of State went on to refer
    to background evidence which she said showed that medical treatment for
    a variety of mental health  conditions  was  available  in  Sri  Lanka.
    There  was  insufficient  evidence  of  any  severe  difficulties  that
    prevented him from obtaining the medical treatment he required  in  Sri
    Lanka.

14. At the time of his asylum claim, he had confirmed he was able to  speak
    to his mother.  It was also noted that in his statement of  7  December
    2011 he said that he spoke to his mother whenever it was OK for her  to
    call him.

The Hearing before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

15. For the purposes of the  appeal  hearing,  the  appellant's  solicitors
    compiled an  appellant's  bundle  which  contained  all  Sarah  Rance's
    reports on the appellant running from 2009 until 7 August 2014.  In her
    most recent report, she said in her professional opinion that  T  would
    be at serious risk of relapse in his PTSD symptoms were he returned  to
    Sri Lanka.  Although the symptoms of PTSD displayed by T on arrival  in
    this country had initially subsided, his adverse experiences  here  had
    brought about a relapse.  It would most likely be  detrimental  to  T's
    mental health and welfare for him to be returned to Sri Lanka where  he
    would not  have  access  to  the  necessary  professional  support  and
    treatment.  Here he continued to be supported by a  centre  in  Newham,
    who were monitoring his mental health.  They were  able  to  offer  low
    level interventions in counselling and cognitive  behavioural  therapy,
    but might well need to refer him onto the Community Mental Health  Team
    for in-depth treatment if necessary.

16. In his subsequent decision, Judge Coll's findings  of  credibility  and
    fact were set out at paragraphs [63] onwards.  Having  found  that  the
    appellant would not be at risk  upon  return  to  Sri  Lanka  of  being
    exposed to treatment which might give rise to a need for  international
    refugee protection, the judge turned to address two  other  strands  of
    the appellant's claim.  The first of these was  that  he  ought  to  be
    treated as having qualified for settlement; and the second was that, in
    the alternative, his return to Sri Lanka would breach his rights  under
    Article 3 ECHR on medical grounds:

         "72. I turn now to  the  appellant's  representative's  submissions
             that the Immigration Rules do not apply given the date of  the
             application in 2011 and that, but for the  respondent's  delay
             of two and a half years, the appellant would have accrued  six
             years' discretionary leave and accordingly qualified under the
             pre July 2012 policy for settlement.

         73.  I accept that the respondent delayed by two and a  half  years
             but the question before me is whether the appellant  has  been
             prejudiced by such delay.  I find that the appellant  has  not
             for the  following  reasons.   First,  I  find  that,  if  the
             application had been dealt  with  in  a  timely  fashion,  the
             appellant would have still been an unaccompanied child  asylum
             seeker and thus been granted a further period of discretionary
             leave - either up to three years' or up to  the  age  of  17�,
             whichever was the sooner.  In the appellant's case, this would
             have been until 17� years  of  age  i.e.  14  September  2013.
             Secondly, I find that he would have needed to make  his  third
             application and applied for further leave before the expiry of
             the further period  of  discretionary  leave  i.e.  before  14
             September 2013.

         74.  Thirdly, at the point of  making  his  third  application,  he
             would not have had six years' discretionary leave (but  rather
             a few months short of five years').  He  would  therefore  not
             have been eligible to apply for settlement.  For this  reason,
             given that his third application would have been in  September
             2013, Appendix FM and  Paragraph  276ADE  of  the  Immigration
             Rules are appropriate to apply in deciding  this  appeal.   In
             sum, I find that the appellant cannot say  that  he  has  been
             disadvantaged by the respondent's delay.  In addition, I  find
             that the appellant cannot  reasonably  say  that  without  the
             respondent's delay, he would have been granted  further  leave
             to remain after the age of 17� years of age.

              ...

         78.  The appellant in evidence said that he had lost  his  mother's
             telephone number and without that, had been unable to  contact
             her.  I accept the appellant's evidence that he was not  still
             in contact with his mother.  Nevertheless, that the  appellant
             may still have family members in the form of  his  mother  and
             younger brother in Sri Lanka and the  Red  Cross,  having  met
             with him twice, may agree to assist him and succeed in tracing
             them.  In that case, I find that he could turn to  his  mother
             and brother if he were to be returned because he was  on  good
             terms with his mother before he lost contact.  If  his  family
             are not found, bearing in mind that he still speaks Tamil  and
             has obtained an education in the  meantime,  I  find  that  he
             could resettle if the need arose, given  that  he  spent  more
             than half his life in Sri Lanka.  I  find  that  he  spent  12
             years in Sri Lanka and that at the date of his application for
             further leave, he was 15 years old and  at  the  date  of  the
             appeal before me, 18, thus having spent respectively three  to
             six years of his life in the United Kingdom.  In  consequence,
             I find that he cannot satisfy Paragraph 276 ADE.

         79.  Turning to the appellant's claims based upon his mental health
             and taking account of the evidence of Ms Rance and Ms Raulefs,
             I find on the facts before me that the  appellant's  PTSD  has
             improved considerably from the point when he started treatment
             in 2009 to today and that although he has  some  symptoms,  he
             has made a good recovery for the following reasons.  First, he
             is not on any medication.  Secondly, I find that the intensity
             of his therapy with Ms  Rance  reduced  over  the  years  from
             weekly to monthly  as  a  reflection  of  the  fact  that  his
             condition was no longer severe.   Thirdly,  since  leaving  Ms
             Rance's service in or  about  March  2014,  he  has  not  been
             referred for appropriate  NHS  Adult  Services  for  continued
             psychotherapy.  Fourthly,  his  therapy  with  Ms  Raulefs  is
             focussed on improving life skills such as self-confidence, and
             relationships, I find that if he had not continued to make and
             maintain a good recovery, he would have been referred back  to
             the NHS for Adult Psychotherapeutic Services.

              ...

         81.  I am aware also of the case of GS (India) referred to  in  the
             respondent's submissions above.  GS (India) held that  foreign
             nationals who were  suffering  from  a  terminal  illness  and
             liable for  removal,  might  avail  themselves  of  Article  3
             protection   in   exceptional   circumstances.    "Exceptional
             circumstances" were confined however to  deathbed  cases.   On
             the basis that the appellant's Article 3 claims  failed  there
             was no basis to allow the additional claims under  Article  8.
             The court agreed with the decision  in  MM  (Zimbabwe)  [2012]
             EWCA Civ 279 that  in  order  for  the  appellants  to  engage
             Article 8 successfully, there had to be factors in addition to
             the lack of adequate medical care in the  country  of  origin.
             As per MM (Zimbabwe), the court accepted that if  any  of  the
             appellants had established firm family ties  in  the  UK  then
             that (hypothetical) fact  coupled  with  the  availability  of
             continued medical treatment in the UK would engage Article  8.
             A claim under Article 8 based  on  the  disparity  of  medical
             treatment abroad was not however sufficient.

         82.  In effect, the appellant's  representative  submits  that  the
             appellant's Article 3 rights  and  Article  8  rights  to  the
             preservation  of  his  mental  stability   (i.e.   his   moral
             integrity) would be breached in that he  will  relapse  if  he
             were  removed  to  a  country  where  he  will   not   receive
             appropriate or sufficient treatment and support for his PTSD.

         80.  I find that the appellant's PTSD does not bring him within the
             exceptional circumstances set out in  GS  (India).   For  that
             reason, his appeal under Article 3 cannot succeed.

         81.  Under GS (India) I find that the appellant  does  not  succeed
             under Article 8 on health grounds alone because he has  failed
             to succeed under Article 3."



The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

17. At the hearing before me to determine whether an error of law was  made
    out, Ms Allen, who did not appear below, developed the arguments raised
    in the grounds of appeal.  On behalf of  the  Secretary  of  State,  Mr
    Kandola stood by the Rule 24 response.

Discussion

18. Despite Ms Allen's best efforts, she is unable to persuade me that  the
    judge erred in law as argued in ground 1.  It is indisputable that  the
    effect of the respondent's delay in responding to  the  appellant's  in
    time application for further leave has been to considerably extend  the
    period of the appellant's lawful residence in the United Kingdom.   But
    he never had a legitimate expectation that his discretionary  leave  to
    remain would be  extended,  as  the  basis  on  which  he  was  granted
    discretionary leave was that he was  an  unaccompanied  asylum  seeking
    minor, and the discretionary leave on that account only ran  until  the
    appellant was aged 17�.  The appellant had  no  legitimate  expectation
    that discretionary leave would be extended beyond  his  18th  birthday,
    since after his 18th birthday he would cease to be a minor and thus  he
    would cease to meet the essential precondition which had triggered  the
    initial grant of discretionary leave.

19. The policy statement relied on before the First-tier  Tribunal  was  as
    follows:

         'Those who, before 9 July 2012, have been granted leave  under  the
         DL policy in force at the time will normally continue to  be  dealt
         with under that policy (my emphasis) through to settlement if  they
         qualify for it (normally after accruing six years' continuous  DL).
         Further leave applications and those granted up to three years'  DL
         before 9 July 2012 are subject to an active review.'

20. The further leave application from the  appellant  was  subject  to  an
    active review, and hence the appellant's solicitors  corresponded  with
    the Active  Review  Unit  of  the  Home  Office.   If  the  appellant's
    application for further leave had been dealt with expeditiously by  the
    Home Office, it would not have been dealt with on the basis that  prima
    facie the  appellant  ought  to  be  granted  a  further  three  years'
    continuous DL running from the age of 17� until the age of 20�; but  on
    the basis that he was no longer eligible  for  an  extension  of  leave
    under  the  particular  policy  which  had  applied  to   him   as   an
    unaccompanied asylum seeking minor.  There  needed  to  be  some  other
    powerful justification for the appellant being granted an extension  of
    leave - beyond mere length of residence or delay on  the  part  of  the
    Secretary of State in making a decision on his application.

21. Ground 2 is that no consideration was given by the judge  to  both  the
    impact of the removal and the obstacles to reintegration, and that  the
    findings of the judge in respect of the appellant's mental health  were
    solely based upon the progress being made by him in the UK.  They  pre-
    supposed that there would not be a relapse, when the clinical  evidence
    clearly showed that a relapse was more likely than not.  In failing  to
    consider the evidence of qualified clinicians who had long-term ongoing
    contact with the appellant, it was argued  that  the  judge  materially
    erred in law.

22. I consider that the judge adequately  addressed  the  medical  evidence
    relied on, and has given adequate reasons for finding, by reference  to
    relevant case law, that the evidence did not disclose a  real  risk  of
    Article 3 harm on medical grounds and/or a real risk of a violation  of
    the appellant's physical and moral integrity such as to engage  Article
    8 ECHR.  It was open to the judge to find  that  there  had  been  some
    improvement  in  the  appellant's  condition  since  Ms  Rance's   last
    assessment on 7 August 2015. It thereby followed that  the  apprehended
    risk of a relapse on return to Sri Lanka had receded.

23. The argument advanced in ground 2 also ignores the fact that the  judge
    made an unchallenged finding that, on his  return  to  Sri  Lanka,  the
    appellant could turn to  his  mother  and  brother  for  emotional  and
    practical support, because he was on good terms with his mother  before
    he lost contact.  One  of  the  central  reasons  for  the  appellant's
    psychological disturbance, as opined by Ms Rance, was  separation  from
    his mother.

24. Ground 3 is that the judge had failed to correctly apply the case of GS
    India.  The ratio of GS India, according to the pleader of ground 3, is
    that the court agreed with the decision in MM  (Zimbabwe)  [2012]  EWCA
    Civ 279 that in order for an appellant successfully to engage Article 8
    there had to be factors in addition to the  lack  of  adequate  medical
    care in  the  country  of  origin.   It  is  pleaded  that  there  were
    additional factors in the appellant's  life,  which  were  accepted  by
    Judge Coll at paragraph [88] of his determination.  But, it is  argued,
    the judge did  not  bring  these  additional  factors  into  play  when
    dismissing the Article 8 appeal by reference to GS India.

25. There is no merit in this line of argument.   There  were  no  relevant
    additional factors. In paragraphs [75] to [77]  of  his  decision,  the
    judge addressed the proposition  that  the  appellant  had  established
    family life in the UK which would be interfered with  by  his  removal.
    He found that he was living independently from his  aunt  and  cousins,
    and  managing  to  continue  with  his  studies.   At  its  height  his
    relationship with his aunt might have given rise  to  normal  emotional
    ties between a parent and a child, but this was  no  longer  the  case.
    The judge accepted  that  the  appellant  continued  to  have  a  close
    relationship with his two cousins, but he did not  see  them  regularly
    any more, restricting his  visits  to  the  holidays.   He  found  that
    neither he nor  they  had  or  have  a  true  dependency,  emotionally,
    physically and financially upon each other.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not contain  an  error  of  law,
and accordingly the decision stands.  This appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  is
dismissed.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
