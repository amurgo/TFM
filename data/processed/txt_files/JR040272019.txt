    Ms R Moffatt, instructed by Duncan Lewis Solicitors, on behalf of the
    applicant
    Mr A Campbell, instructed by the Solicitor, London Borough of Croydon

                       APPLICATION FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW
                                  JUDGMENT

                          - - - - - - - - - - - - -

        1) I gave this judgment and  reasons  orally  at  the  end  of  the
           hearing on 14 November  2019.  These  written  reasons  are  the
           approved record of those reasons given orally.


      The application


        2) The applicant applied on 18 April 2019 for  judicial  review  of
           the respondent's decision of 31 January to refuse  to  re-assess
           the  applicant's  age;  and,  amongst  other   things,   for   a
           declaration that the applicant's date of birth is 1  July  2002,
           rather than his date of birth as assessed by the respondent of 1
           July 2000 (the 'assessed date of birth').   The  respondent  had
           made its decision on 2 May  2018  that  the  applicant  had  the
           assessed date of birth, following assessment interviews on 8 and
           18 December 2017 and 19 February 2018.


       The proceedings


        3) Following the respondent's May 2018  decision,  the  applicant's
           solicitors wrote to the respondent on  22  January  2019  making
           further submissions. These included a new age assessment,  which
           they said was compliant with the well-known 'Merton guidelines,'
           conducted by two independent social workers, with  the  date  of
           assessment being 23 November 2018; and the conclusion for  which
           was that the applicant had the date of birth as he claimed.  The
           further  submissions  also  included  witness  statements   from
           volunteers who had known the applicant at the  Old  Hamptonian's
           cricket club; workers with  the  'Refugee  Cricket  Project'  or
           'RCP', including an adviser with the Refugee Council  childrens'
           section ; emails  from  the  applicant's  uncle  in  the  United
           States; and a translation of a Taskera, purporting  to  indicate
           the applicant's age, which was consistent with his claimed  date
           of birth.


        4) Despite the further submissions, the respondent  replied  on  31
           January 2019, asserting that the documentation provided did  not
           identify significantly material evidence to warrant a review  or
           reassessment. In particular, the respondent did not  accept  any
           independently commissioned age assessment as the respondent  had
           its own qualified age assessors.

        5) There followed a  letter  before  action  from  the  applicant's
           solicitors dated 26 February 2019, enclosing  the  previous  the
           material; reciting the applicant's claimed  background  history;
           and asserting that the respondent had failed to consider the new
           evidence. Whilst the respondent appeared to  have  disputed  the
           reliability of the applicant's Taskera, the applicant had  asked
           for the return of the original  in  order  to  authenticate  it,
           which the Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  ('SSHD')
           had refused. On the one hand, the respondent asserted that  they
           were unable to carry out verification of the Taskera; but on the
           other hand, the respondent did not accept  its  reliability  and
           placed no weight on it.   The  applicant  had  been  denied  the
           opportunity to verify it, through no fault of his own.

        6) The applicant further asserted that  the  respondent  failed  to
           consider the additional evidence, noting the report of  the  two
           independent social workers and their assessment that his date of
           birth was as claimed. The applicant's solicitors  also  referred
           to the written testimony  of  those  who  had  worked  with,  or
           volunteered alongside, the applicant and who had testified as to
           his  youthful  and  relatively  immature  behaviour,  which  was
           consistent with his claimed date of birth.

        7) The respondent replied to the letter before action on  19  March
           2019, the gist of which was: to attach only very limited  weight
           to  the  Taskera,  noting  that  they  could  not   assess   its
           authenticity and in any event, the year of birth was  stated  in
           the Taskera as being based  only  on  the  applicant's  physical
           appearance; to assert that the  applicant  had  been  given  the
           opportunity to acknowledge that he  understood  the  interpreter
           and the  role  of  other  professionals  during  the  assessment
           interviews; and that  the  applicant's  answers  and  manner  of
           answering questions had led the respondent's assessors to  doubt
           his credibility.   In response to the applicant's evidence,  the
           fact of his interaction with younger people was still consistent
           with the assessed date of birth; his 'moods', lack of engagement
           and  lack  of  independence  could  be  explained  by   cultural
           challenges; and  that  some  of  the  supporting  witnesses  had
           limited direct involvement with the applicant.

        8) The applicant applied for judicial review in the High  Court  on
           18 April 2019.   Her  Honour  Judge  Evans-Gordon  gave  initial
           directions  on  29  April  2019  and  the  respondent  filed  an
           acknowledgement of service on 14 May 2019.  Her Honour Judge Coe
           QC granted permission to proceed to a full hearing, without  the
           need for a litigation friend, in a decision sent on 23 May 2019,
           in which she also transferred proceedings to the Upper Tribunal.
            Upper Tribunal  Judge  Coker  gave  further  directions  on  19
           September 2019 at a case management hearing, which included that
           there would be no cross-examination of assessing social workers;
           but the fact that such assessors were not called  to  give  oral
           evidence did not mean that the  applicant  was  unable  to  make
           submissions on the  assessors'  contemporaneous  notes;  witness
           statements; or age assessment report.

       The applicant's account

        9) The applicant is a citizen of Afghanistan, who  claims  to  have
           fled Afghanistan, on a  precise  date  which  he  is  unable  to
           confirm, but which is in or  around  May  2017;  due  to  feared
           adverse interest from  Daesh  or  the  Taliban,  who  sought  to
           recruit him. He has a separate appeal against the SSHD's refusal
           of his asylum and human rights claims which is before the First-
           tier Tribunal ('FtT'),  but  the  FtT  proceedings  are  stayed,
           pending the conclusion of these judicial review proceedings.  In
           the context of his protection and human rights  claims,  he  has
           attended a screening and substantive asylum interview.


       10) The claimed adverse interest began around two years prior to the
           applicant leaving Afghanistan, when his paternal uncle,  whom  I
           will refer to as 'MS', also fled Afghanistan's  because  he  too
           feared adverse interest, as a  result  of  having  acted  as  an
           interpreter for US forces and contractors for many years.  MS is
           now living in the United States, claiming to have  been  granted
           asylum and having left Afghanistan in May 2015.  Around  a  year
           later in May 2016, having been approached,  on  the  applicant's
           account, either via letters or through face-to-face contact,  or
           both  means,  to  join  the  Taliban  and  having  refused,  the
           applicant's father then disappeared.  The applicant feared  that
           his father had been abducted by Daesh/the Taliban.


       11) The approximate nature of the above dates is illustrated by  the
           fact that the Takera, which the applicant says that he  obtained
           when he was present  with  his  father,  from  local  government
           offices, was produced  on  30  May  2016,  and  in  his  witness
           statements he said that his father disappeared around  either  a
           year after his uncle left  Afghanistan  (which  would  date  his
           disappearance to around May 2016); or in oral evidence to me,  a
           month or two after he got the  Taskera,  which  would  date  his
           father's disappearance to anywhere between June to August 2016.

       12) The applicant claims that after his father's  disappearance,  he
           was then approached by Daesh/the Taliban on his school journeys.
            Fearing that he too would be abducted, his mother and  maternal
           uncle arranged for his passage from  Afghanistan.  He  travelled
           clandestinely  through  a  number  of   third   countries;   was
           encountered and fingerprinted in Slovenia on 2 August  2017,  as
           recorded in Eurodac results; and  claims  to  have  entered  the
           United  Kingdom  clandestinely  in  early  November  2017;   and
           attended the SSHD's offices  in  Croydon  on  6  November  2017,
           presenting his Taskera, which  was  reviewed  by  the  SSHD  who
           informed him that based on what was recorded, he then claimed to
           be 15 years' and four months' old.

       13) The applicant also relies on a subsequent medical report  of  Dr
           Dosani which diagnoses him as suffering  from  a  post-traumatic
           stress disorder ('PTSD') and a  major  depressive  episode  with
           anxiety symptoms, which is said to corroborate his  account  and
           also to explain any possible inconsistencies in the recollection
           of events and dates.

       14) In his judicial review application, the applicant  asserts  that
           he could be expected to be aware of his  age  (contrary  to  the
           respondent's assertions), having attended school for seven years
           until he left Afghanistan at the age of 14; he was literate  and
           it was plausible that he had been made aware of his age  by  his
           parents. There was no inheritance  plausibility  in  the  SSHD's
           interpreter  attributing  a  westernised  day  and  month  to  a
           translation of an Afghan date which had been given as a year  in
           the  Taskera,  noting  that  birthdays  are  not  celebrated  in
           Afghanistan.

       15) Whilst there might be deficiencies in the regional  and  central
           records of Taskera registration, which appeared to suggest  that
           there were no records for the applicant's Taskera,  the  records
           had not been checked the local district level.

       16) There was no evidence to undermine the applicant's claimed  age.
           The assessors' assertions  that  he  was  unable  to  state  the
           precise ages of non-family members in his home village needed to
           be seen in the context of his ability to give his  siblings  and
           parents'.

       17) The applicant also asserts that physical appearance,  which  the
           respondent's  assessors  had  also  taken  into   account,   was
           notoriously  unreliable  when  assessing  age.  The   assessors'
           assertions  that  the  applicant  was  untroubled  by  answering
           questions, which was said to support the  older,  assessed  age,
           was belied by the contemporaneous notes that he  was  upset  and
           tearful during the interviews.

       18) The assessors had also been concerned  that  the  applicant  had
           been aware of what other children,  who  were  claiming  asylum,
           were receiving by way of weekly allowance  in  the  UK  and  had
           therefore failed to disclose all of his contacts and  associates
           in the UK.  In response, the applicant  say  that  he  had  been
           clear in interviews  that  his  friendships  were  via  the  two
           cricket clubs in which he played.   The  statements  of  support
           from the RCP and Old Hamptonian Club members was  based  on  far
           greater contact with the applicant than the assessors, which had
           been for a limited period.

       The respondent's case

       19) The primary case for the respondent is that the applicant is not
           a credible or honest witness; that the internal  inconsistencies
           in his account undermine his credibility  and  explain  why  his
           father obtained either a fake Taskera  and  one  which  was  not
           accurate  about  his  age.   This,   coupled   with   what   the
           respondent's assessors regarded  as  his  mature  demeanour  and
           physical appearance; and his willingness  to  provide  what  the
           assessors regarded as scripted answers to  questions,  supported
           the older, assessed date of birth of 1 July 2000, rather than  1
           July 2002. In particular, while the applicant  claimed  to  know
           his own age, he had displayed a limited and confused concept  of
           others' ages.  He had described dramatic and distressing  events
           without  displaying  the  emotional  responses  which  would  be
           expected of  someone  of  his  claimed  age.  He  had  a  mature
           understanding personal finances including making choices  as  to
           where to shop; and an ability to organise his laundry; clean his
           accommodation; and could iron.


       20) In terms of the claimed inconsistencies, the applicant had  been
           inconsistent about  how  he  learned  to  shave;  had  given  an
           incoherent explanation about learning to tie shoelaces; had  not
           been candid about how he learnt,  and  from  whom,  what  weekly
           allowance he was entitled to; claimed to know  the  location  of
           his immediate family members despite claiming  the  opposite  on
           other occasions; and he had been inconsistent about when he  was
           approached by Daesh/the Taliban.

       21) In terms of the witnesses in support of the applicant, these had
           been in the context of a specific social  setting,  ie.  playing
           cricket and even then, their evidence was not inconsistent  with
           the assessed age of 1 July 2000.

       The hearing

       22) As well as  considering  the  witness  statements  of  assessing
           social workers, Lorraine  Gregory  and  Simon  Wade;  and  their
           departmental manager, Mr Waseef Harron, (who had  not  conducted
           the  assessment  himself  but  provided  a  commentary  on   the
           assessment) I heard evidence from the following individuals, who
           spoke to their witness statements and also  provided  additional
           oral evidence: -


       The applicant:  When giving oral  evidence,  the  applicant  had  the
       assistance of an Afghan Pashtu interpreter, noting that he claimed to
       have difficulties with previous  translators  during  age  assessment
       interviews where the translator had been a Pakistani Pashtu  speaker.
       I was conscious that even in the context of his disputed age, even on
       the respondent's case, the applicant was a young person, who was said
       to be suffering from  PTSD  and  anxiety  and  I  treated  him  as  a
       vulnerable witness. In doing so, I asked him to indicate at any stage
       if he didn't understand any of the questions put to him or needed any
       breaks. He appeared able to engage at all stages with  the  questions
       put to him and asked questions of his own. I was  satisfied  that  he
       was able to participate adequately in the proceedings before  me  and
       that  Mr  Campbell  cross-examined  the  applicant  in  a  courteous,
       professional and sensitive way.


       Anoop Jaijee:  Mr  Jaijee  is  a  long-standing  member  of  the  Old
       Hamptonians Cricket Club, and around 2 years ago became  involved  in
       working with Refugee Cricket Project,  as  a  volunteer.   Mr  Jaijee
       played around 10 matches and met with the applicant around  15  times
       during the summer cricket season in 2018; and for fewer occasions  in
       2019 when the applicant played on only  a  couple  of  occasions.  Mr
       Jaijee's dealings with the applicant involved not  only  speaking  to
       him directly but also observing him over a number of  hours.  He  has
       never claimed to have any  professional  social  work  experience  or
       qualifications in age assessments, but has regular interactions  with
       other young people in the age range spanning the claimed and assessed
       dates of birth for the applicant, ie, those aged between 16  and  18,
       in 2018.


       Charmaine McGusty  Khoumeri:  Ms  McGusty  Khoumeri  was  a  personal
       adviser employed by the respondent and is now a  fast  track  trainee
       social worker, albeit no longer employed by the respondent.  She  had
       dealings with the applicant as his personal adviser from 9 July until
       17 October 2018. She did not claim to have age  assessment  training,
       but she had worked in a variety of roles with young people from 2000,
       including with the people with ages within the disputed age range.


       Robert Curtis: Mr Curtis is a youth caseworker with the South  London
       Refugee Association, who once  again  does  not  claim  to  have  any
       specialist age assessment training, but has worked with the applicant
       since May 2018 in three capacities: initially as a volunteer with the
       Refugee Cricket Project from late July 2018;  from  July  to  October
       2018 as a full-time caseworker  with  the  same  project;  and  since
       October 2018 with the South London Refugee Association.  During  each
       of the periods, Mr Curtis has been able to observe the applicant  and
       has had dealings with him, albeit in  different  capacities  and  the
       nature of his interactions  has  varied  over  time,  but  which  has
       included supervised immigration advice.


       Shahernaz Kargar: Ms Kargar  is  a  professional  adviser  and  youth
       worker for the Refugee Cricket Project. She also does not purport  to
       have a specialist age assessment training, but has worked with  young
       people for a number of years including the RCP since 1  August  2018;
       prior to that as a children's adviser of the Refugee Council  and  as
       an educational  coordinator  of  the  Afghanistan  and  Central  Asia
       Association. She advises on immigration and welfare issues  including
       age disputes and is qualified to OISC level  1.  She  has  previously
       given oral evidence in age disputes before the  Upper  Tribunal.  She
       became the Refugee Council caseworker for the  applicant  in  October
       2018 and also assisted him, albeit unsuccessfully, in a  British  Red
       Cross tracing referral.


       Aleisha McKenzie: Ms McKenzie was the  applicant's  personal  adviser
       from June 2019 but has recently ceased that role as  she  is  leaving
       the  respondent's  employment  shortly.  She  met  the  applicant   2
       occasions on 8 July and 17 July 2019 in the context  of  his  raising
       concerns about his accommodation and threats by a fellow resident.


       Sufyan Khan: Mr Khan is the captain of the Old Hamptonian's '3rd  11'
       cricket team and also does not have  any  formal  experience  in  age
       assessment or any social work experience, but has known the applicant
       since March 2018 and played with the  applicant  regularly  over  the
       course of the summer 2018 season, albeit far  less  so  during  2019,
       when the applicant was promoted to the '2nd 11' team.

       Discussion


       23) The purpose of this judgment  is  to  decide,  as  a  fact,  the
           applicant's date of birth. There is no burden of proof on either
           party  and  the  standard  of  proof  is  on  the   balance   of
           probabilities. In reaching my decision, I have considered all of
           the evidence, whether I refer to it specifically or not, as well
           as the written skeleton arguments and oral  submissions  of  the
           parties' Counsel. Both Ms Moffatt and Mr  Campbell  made  clear,
           focussed and helpful submissions  which  greatly  assisted  this
           Tribunal in reaching a decision.


       24) Whie I have considered  all  of  the  evidence  holistically,  I
           started with  an  assessment  of  the  applicant's  credibility,
           noting with caution that the issue of credibility  is  only  one
           part of the my assessment of his date of birth.

      Credibility - the applicant's appreciation of age

       25) One  of  the  challenges  to  the  applicant's  credibility  was
           identified by Ms Gregory in her witness  statement  at  �  [10],
           page [H4] of the applicant's bundle ('AB'), as being that he had
           a limited and confused concept of age. On the one hand,  he  was
           unable to give the ages for those children in his  home  village
           who were younger than him; on the other, he gave a specific  age
           bracket for those people older than him; and he  was  unable  to
           distinguish between a child and  an  adult.  She  describes  his
           understanding of age as biased and possibly  also  scripted.  In
           common with her  co-assessor,  Mr  Wade,  Ms  Gregory's  witness
           statement does not refer to  any  particular  part  of  her  age
           assessment report in making these comments, so I considered  the
           reports and typed records, such as they were available, in full.
            In doing so, I accept Ms Moffatt's  submission  that  I  should
           approach what the applicant is reported as having  said  in  the
           report and typed records with  some  caution,  as  only  partial
           handwritten notes have been disclosed; that  the  typed  written
           notes were from an unidentified author, did  not  appear  to  be
           contemporaneous,  or   consistent   with   the   contemporaneous
           handwritten notes; and  the  final  report  was  also,  in  some
           respects, inconsistent with the handwritten notes.

       26) The assessment report at [E6] AB records the applicant  as  able
           to describe the age of his siblings. The applicant was asked  if
           he was the oldest child in the village and [E6] records:

       "He stated that 'they were younger than me' and the next oldest 'were
       all men, 20-25.' These comments show that the applicant has a limited
       concept of age - is not able to give an age  for  those  he  sees  as
       younger than him but is able  to  age  those  older  than  him  using
       specific numbers."

       27) Contrary to the report, in my view, the applicant's  answers  do
           not support an assertion that the applicant was inconsistent  in
           his ability to assess age. The report does not suggest that  the
           applicant was asked about  the  specific  ages  of  people,  but
           merely whether he was the oldest child in the  village,  and  he
           did, providing comments in  general  terms.  The  fact  that  he
           provided an age range for those older  than  him,  but  not  for
           those younger than him, does not demonstrate  any  inconsistency
           in  an  appreciation  of  age.  In  terms  his   visibility   to
           distinguish between children  and  older  people,  at  [E7],  he
           described certain roles as being age-specific, for example  when
           somebody could begin to work on land because  they  were  strong
           enough.  He described differentiators as  including  men  having
           beards and their  bodies  being  different.  He  also  described
           children having more limited knowledge about matters but he  was
           able  to  provide  the  nuanced  comment  that  apparent  mental
           development could also depend on someone's intelligence.


       28)  Contrary  to  the  assertion  that  he  had   an   inconsistent
           appreciation  of  age  which  undermined  his  credibility,  his
           comments as recorded in  the  report  indicated  a  nuanced  and
           consistent appreciation of age, which was also  consistent  with
           his  oral  evidence  before  me.    In  his  oral  evidence,  he
           described the education system in Afghanistan.  While he stopped
           attending  school  at  the  end  of  year  seven  when  he  left
           Afghanistan, he explained that not everyone in year seven was of
           the same age, as if people did not perform satisfactorily,  they
           were held back in school years. Similarly, very clever  children
           could jump year-groups. He was also able to explain that in  the
           UK, when he had attended school on an  ESOL  course,  it  was  a
           specialist unit within the school, with other pupils of  varying
           ages.


       29) A second criticism was that the applicant was unable to  explain
           the context of how his parents had informed him of  his  precise
           age. This again this was  referred  to  by  Ms  Gregory  in  her
           witness statement � [11], page [H5] AB, although once again, she
           does not cross refer to any particular documents.  However,  the
           report at [E12] AB does not make such  a  criticism.  It  merely
           states that the applicant had been asked his age,  to  which  he
           responded and indicated  that  he  had  provided  proof  with  a
           Taskera, which was based on  what  his  father  told  him.   The
           report refers to the fact that  the  SSHD  did  not  accept  the
           reliability of the Taskera.   The  report  does  not  go  on  to
           suggest that the applicant had been asked about, and was  unable
           to explain, the context in which the  applicant  had  been  told
           about his age by his father. In  contrast,  I  accept  and  take
           judicial notice of the fact that birthdays  are  not  celebrated
           culturally in Afghanistan  and  that  the  applicant  will  have
           relied on what he was told when he  accompanied  his  father  to
           obtain his Taskera.  In summary, the claim  that  the  applicant
           was unable to answer questions about the circumstances in  which
           he knew of his age was  not  supported  by  the  age  assessment
           report or the evidence before me.


       The applicant's lack of emotional response


       30) The applicant's credibility was further  challenged  because  of
           his lack of an emotional response to  dramatic  and  distressing
           events, once  again  reported  by  Ms  Gregory  in  her  witness
           statement at � [11], page [H5] AB.  This is briefly referred  to
           in the assessment report at [E8], when the applicant  was  asked
           about  seeing  people  die  as  he  transited  through   various
           countries on his journey to the UK.   That section of the report
           did not suggest that  the  applicant  was  calm  and  apparently
           unaffected, so as to corroborate the assessed date of birth.  In
           contrast, Ms Moffatt referred to the contemporaneous notes which
           described the applicant as being upset and asking for  a  break,
           as he was tearful. I accept that the assessment report does  not
           attempt to capture every detail, but the assertion of a  general
           impression of somebody who has  been  calm  and,  to  a  degree,
           calculating and evasive in his questions,  does  not  accurately
           reflect the  distress  which  at  times  the  applicant  clearly
           displayed.  Moreover, I would, in any event, be  cautious  about
           prescribing a lack of emotional response to age-related maturity
           when, as in this case, the applicant was said  to  be  suffering
           from post-traumatic stress disorder,  so  that  any  lack  of  a
           response could, at least  in  part,  be  unrelated  to  age  and
           instead be the result  of  disassociation,  which  is  a  common
           symptom or facet of PTSD.


       Shaving


       31) The assessment report  refers  at  [E10]  AB  to  the  applicant
           explaining that he was able to shave in the UK as he watched his
           father shaving in Afghanistan.  The applicant is criticised  for
           being inconsistent about whether he shaves or not.  However,  on
           a full review of what the applicant is recorded as saying in the
           report, it is clear that the applicant immediately qualified his
           initial statement that he did not shave, with a further  comment
           that he only shaved on his upper  lip.   Mr  Campbell  suggested
           that whilst it  was  perfectly  possible  that  the  applicant's
           father may have shaved in front of the applicant in a small home
           in  Afghanistan,  there  would  have  been  no  reason  for  the
           applicant to have watched his  father  shaving  with  sufficient
           closeness, when he was not of an age to need to shake himself. I
           do not accept that submission, which I regard as  no  more  than
           speculative. It is perfectly possible that a  child's  curiosity
           in his father may resulted in  a  distinct  memory  of  shaving,
           noting than at a young age, the father may be a central focus of
           a child's life.  To the extent that there is  any  inconsistency
           about whether the applicant began shaving during his journey  to
           UK or subsequently on his  arrival,  I  do  not  find  that  any
           inconsistency is material.






       Shoelace-tying


       32) The assessment report takes issue at [E10]  with  the  applicant
           indicating that  he  had  been  taught  by  his  mother  to  tie
           shoelaces in Afghanistan. It was suggested that because  he  had
           indicated that he wore open-toed shoes or sandals in Afghanistan
           that this was that somehow damaging to his credibility, as these
           would not have laces.   The  applicant's  response  was  simple,
           namely that he had not been asked whether he also wore shoes  in
           Afghanistan.  Ms Moffatt  urged  me  to  consider  that  it  was
           perfectly plausible that he wore shoes as  well  as  sandals  in
           Afghanistan, bearing in mind  that  temperatures  drop  to  well
           below zero in Afghanistan during winter months,  as  opposed  to
           the hot summer months when sandals may be worn.  Once  again,  I
           accept Ms Moffatt's submission  that  the  applicant  cannot  be
           criticised for failing to answer a question that  he  was  never
           asked and that it is perfectly plausible that he wore both shoes
           and open toed sandals in Afghanistan at different times  of  the
           year.


       Unwillingness to disclose associations and friendships


       33) The assessment report also suggests at [E10] that the  applicant
           was aware of his entitlement to his  weekly  allowance  but  was
           quoted as saying that he was unable to  say  where  he  obtained
           this  information  from  and  as  a  result,  the   respondent's
           assessors believed he had more friends and  associates  than  he
           had  previously  stated,  including,  potentially,  adults.  The
           report indicates the applicant said that he had many friends but
           was unable to say  how  he  knew  those  friends.  I  accept  Ms
           Moffatt's submission that the manuscript notes,  even  only  the
           parts provided, directly contradicted that  assertion.  At  page
           [I284], following a passage about the applicant explaining about
           the weekly allowance he believed he was entitled to,  he  stated
           that he knew a lot of people  whom  he  had  met  while  playing
           cricket:


           "All of them were under 18, aged between 13,  14  and  16  there
           were also many Afghans in school, they  have  my  phone  number,
           talk to each other daily. When asked how they got to  know  more
           about him, explained that all them come to the cricket club."


       34)  Not  only  did  the   applicant   provide   a   contemporaneous
           explanation,  but  his  explanation  was  consistent  with   the
           evidence of the RCP witnesses who explained the large number  of
           young Afghan males who played cricket under the auspices of that
           project.


       Contact with family members


       35) The respondent's case records, (albeit  not  contemporaneous  or
           claiming to be verbatim, but in summary format only)  stated  at
           [I26] AB, on 25 January 2018, that:


           "The applicant said that he knows  where  his  immediate  family
           members are and will contact them when ready. He  said  that  he
           does not require the support of Red Cross  tracing  service  and
           has an uncle in the USA with whom he is used to  contacting  via
           mobile and who is able to  pass  information  about  his  family
           members welfare."


       36) Mr Campbell submits that this contradicted his subsequent  claim
           that he had lost contact with his immediate family  members.  In
           response, the applicant explained that having arrived in the  UK
           in November 2017, he was initially hopeful that he would be able
           to  be  in  contact  with  his  mother  and  maternal  uncle  in
           Afghanistan as he had their mobile telephone  numbers.  However,
           he later attempted to contact them and was unable to do so.


       37) I had concerns about the applicant's credibility on this  point,
           particularly in relation to his plausibility. On the  one  hand,
           he has mobile telephone numbers for his family but  on  arriving
           in the UK and claiming asylum, he claims not  to  have  promptly
           sought to make contact with them, to let them know of  his  safe
           arrival. I also had concerns that he gave oral evidence that his
           maternal uncle and mother were in regular discussions, following
           his father's disappearance, with his paternal uncle, MS, in  the
           US, about the father's disappearance. MS was noticeably vague in
           his statement at [J209] about the timing  and  circumstances  of
           the  applicant's  father's  disappearance  and  the  applicant's
           journey to the UK. Whilst MS suggests that he lost contact  with
           the applicant's mother and maternal uncle in late 2017, he  does
           not explain the breakdown in contact in any detail.

       38) On the other  hand,  I  accept  Ms  Moffatt's   submission,  for
           purpose of this age assessment only (as opposed to a  subsequent
           assessment of his asylum claim, which I am  not  engaging  with)
           that the applicant cannot be blamed for  not  adducing  evidence
           which his lawyers might otherwise  have  been  readily  able  to
           provide, e.g. a fuller witness statement from MS  about  how  he
           maintained contact with the  applicant's  mother  and  uncle  in
           Afghanistan and the records of such contact,  particularly  when
           Ms Kargar gave evidence  that  she  had  obtained  MS's  witness
           statement, following telephone  calls  with  him.   Ms  Kargar's
           evidence, which I accept, is that she had not asked MS about any
           detail  concerning  the  timing   and   circumstances   of   the
           applicant's father's disappearance, which might also explain the
           lack of detail about any ongoing contact and loss of contact  in
           2017.  She  described  having  been  provided  with  a  list  of
           questions by the applicant's solicitor, and she limited  herself
           to those questions.  I also accept Ms Kargar's evidence that she
           did subsequently attempt to assist  the  applicant  with  a  Red
           Cross tracing enquiry, through a block booking with a number  of
           clients of the Refugee Council, but unfortunately the Red  Cross
           were unable to assist,  given  the  security  situation  in  the
           region in which the applicant's family lived.


       39) In summary,  my  concerns  about  the  lack  of  detail  in  the
           applicant's  account  of  family  contact  is  mitigated  by  Ms
           Kargar's evidence that she limited her questions of MS; and  her
           evidence of subsequent tracing enquiries, although  my  concerns
           about the plausibility of the  applicant  not  seeking  to  make
           contact with his mother and uncle by January 2018 remain.


       Adverse interest from Daesh/the Taliban


       40) The  respondent  also  asserted  that  the  applicant  had  been
           inconsistent about when he was the subject of  adverse  interest
           from  Daesh/the  Taliban;  either  claiming  this  was  at   the
           beginning of 2017; or 2015,  as  recorded  in  the  respondent's
           refusal of the asylum claim at [J145].  I  accept  Ms  Moffatt's
           submission that there is no  such  inconsistency  and  that  the
           respondent has confused the adverse interest which prompted  the
           applicant's paternal uncle to leave Afghanistan  in  2015,  with
           the adverse interest towards the applicant at the  beginning  of
           2017.


       Other issues of consistency


       41) Mr Campbell submitted that in his oral evidence,  the  applicant
           was also inconsistent. In  particular,  the  applicant  asserted
           that  having  escaped  from  the  lorry  by  which   he   gained
           clandestine entry to the UK, he walked all of  the  way  to  the
           SSHD's  offices  in  Croydon  as  opposed  to   an   alternative
           explanation of travel by train and then by foot. I  accept  that
           the applicant's answers were not consistent and that Mr  Campell
           had carefully and precisely asked his questions to the applicant
           as to whether he  travelled  entirely  on  foot,  to  which  the
           applicant initially indicated that he had.


       42)  I  also  accept  Mr  Campbell's  submission   the   applicant's
           subsequent assertion that he had not intended to leave the train
           journey at Croydon, but had left  the  train  early  because  he
           feared discovery by ticket inspectors and he had not purchased a
           ticket, and so alighted at the train station next to the  SSHD's
           offices purely by coincidence, was so implausible  that  it  was
           not accurate. I do not accept that the  implausibility  of  that
           explanation  could  be  explained   by   any   difficulties   in
           recollection because of the applicant's  PTSD,  anxiety  or  his
           relative youth. It was a clear attempt by the applicant to avoid
           the issue of how he was able to travel from  the  lorry  to  the
           SSHD's offices, and  was  an  intentionally  untruthful  answer.
           Whilst possibly an untruth which it did not serve him  well,  Ms
           Moffatt asked me to  consider,  in  the  alternative,  that  his
           attempt to conceal the nature of  his  movements  was  explained
           because he had been told to conceal  them  by  his  traffickers.
           That explanation must be speculative and regardless  of  motive,
           it is clear that the  applicant  is,  on  occasion,  willing  to
           provide untruthful evidence, where he is concerned that to  tell
           the truth might not assist his case, or get him or  others  into
           trouble.


       43) In cross-examination, Mr Campbell has  highlighted  an  occasion
           when the applicant has attempted to mislead; and I had  concerns
           about the plausibility of the lack of attempted contact  between
           the applicant and his maternal uncle and mother between November
           2017 and January 2018.

       44) However, despite those two aspects of concern, the broad  thrust
           of the respondent's criticisms as to the applicant's credibility
           are not sustained. For the purposes of these proceedings,  there
           remains broad  consistency  in  most  of  the  applicant's  core
           account (noting the missing details in MS's witness  statement).
           The timings of  events,  albeit  not  precise,  are  just  about
           internally consistent and importantly, the  sequence  of  events
           with MS's departure to the US; the applicant's father  obtaining
           the applicant's Taskera; the  applicant's  father  disappearing;
           and the applicant himself subsequently  becoming  the  focus  of
           adverse attention; is consistent.

       Other age-related attributes and evidence


       The Taskera

       45) In relation to the Taskera document, Ms Moffatt and Mr  Campbell
           agreed that the Taskera was  of  limited  evidential  weight  in
           terms of the claimed or assessed age. One  hand,  there  was  an
           expert report of Professor Giustozzi which  suggested  that  the
           central  records  in  Afghanistan  showed  no  record  for   the
           applicant's  Taskera;  on  the  other  hand,   the   applicant's
           representatives pointed out that there had  been  no  search  at
           local office level, and the level of  bureaucratic  inefficiency
           was such  that  was  perfectly  possible  that  the  applicant's
           Taskera, while  registered  locally,  had  not  been  registered
           centrally.


       46) Even if the document were genuine, the point was  made  that  it
           merely described the applicant's age, at [D36] AB, as follows:

           "As per physical appearance his age is determined the 14 year as
           at 2016"

       47) Just as age assessors and Tribunals exercise significant caution
           when assessing  age  on  the  basis  of  physical  maturity,  an
           assessment by the Afghan authorities on  a  similar  basis  must
           have very limited weight  attached  to  it.  Whilst  I  make  no
           findings to whether or not the Taskera is a fake document,  even
           if it were genuine, its contents cannot be considered reliable.


       Finances and demeanour

       48) Separate from the issue  the  applicant's  credibility  and  the
           Taskera, factors said to be relevant to his age were his ability
           to budget and juggle his  finances;  and  the  maturity  of  his
           interaction with those around his claimed age and  those  of  an
           older age.


       49) In relation to finances, Mr Campbell invited me to consider that
           because the applicant was spending the limited funds he  had  on
           food, rather than on any  superfluous  items,  his  struggle  in
           feeding himself and maintaining a budget was explained either by
           the very limited amount of money that he  received,  or  in  the
           alternative because he could  not  cook  and  therefore  had  to
           resort to buying fast food. Neither was  inconsistent  with  his
           assessed age.  Moreover,  in  his  dealings  with  his  personal
           advisor, when he had lost a pre-paid supermarket  card,  he  was
           able to  'negotiate'  a  replacement  card.  In  particular,  Ms
           McGusty Khoumeri described in her  witness  statement  at  at  �
           [14], page [H14], meeting with him on 30 July 2018.  Ms  McGusty
           Khoumeri  explained  that  the  'negotiations'   comprised   the
           applicant saying that he would prefer a replacement card, rather
           than dry food which he would need to cook.

       50) Without criticising Ms McGusty Khoumeri in any way, who I  found
           to be an honest witness, she confirmed that her contact with him
           was limited; and that her comment about his  ability  to  manage
           financial matters was limited  to  her  interaction  about  what
           foodstuffs or food vouchers he would wish to have. She  accepted
           the in other areas such as his concerns about  accommodation  on
           10 September 2018, whilst he had put  forward  matters  clearly,
           and in a manner she described as  'mature,'  her  notes  in  the
           respondent's case record at I51 AB emphasised that he was upset,
           albeit he later calmed down; and she accepted that his   ability
           to  convey  clear  concerns  about  his  accommodation  were  in
           untypical circumstances, ie. he claimed to have been  threatened
           by a fellow resident with a knife and therefore would  have  had
           little choice but to have reported the incident,  regardless  of
           his age.


       51) In relation to maturity in relation to financial matters and  an
           ability to cope, both Ms  Kargar  and  Mr  Curtis  regarded  the
           applicant as 'needier' than someone of the assessed age.   While
           they  have  no  formal  age  assessment  experience,  both   had
           significantly greater exposure to the  applicant  than  the  age
           assessors and personal advisers  and  their  honesty  in  giving
           evidence was accepted. Mr Curtis, in  oral  evidence,  described
           the applicant as appearing neglected, completely  withdrawn  and
           struggling with the transition from social worker support  as  a
           'looked after'  child  to  an  adult,  in  a  way  that  in  his
           experience was not typical. Mr Curtis  described  that  even  if
           part of his difficulties with coping could have been  caused  by
           the limited amount of money that  the  applicant  received  each
           week, nevertheless, this was not the full explanation and had to
           be contextualised in the applicant's presentation as  neglected,
           withdrawn and struggling to the extent that  Mr  Curtis  believe
           the applicant to be at real risk of not having his needs met. Mr
           Curtis was clear on the stark contrast between how the applicant
           might behave the formal setting,  as  withdrawn  or  disengaged,
           whereas more he might be more emotional in other settings.

       52) Ms Kargar explained in oral evidence that the  applicant  really
           struggled with basic concepts, which she had to explain in  very
           simple terms, even needing to go and get the applicant's  Oyster
           card with him as he was unable to do so; that he could  be  very
           emotional with her.


       53) I attached particular weight to the evidence of Mr Curtis and Ms
           Kargar, not because I had any  concerns  about  the  honesty  or
           integrity of the other witnesses;  (save for the applicant which
           I have outlined); but because of the careful witness evidence of
           Mr Curtis and Ms Kargar,  when  they  were  willing  to  concede
           points which were not necessarily in the applicant's favour. For
           example, each confirmed that  attributes  and  behaviours  could
           exist on 'a curve' within a range of ages.  One  might  have  an
           immature 19-year-old as opposed to mature 17-year-old; and in Ms
           Kargar's case she accepted the limited nature of her questioning
           of MS.

       54) Nevertheless, both had spent a significant period of time,  with
           direct contact with the applicant, over a regular period; in  Ms
           Kargar's case, 300 hours in total, with a frequency of sometimes
           two or three times a week including direct advice to  him  about
           his accommodation, college bursary and liaison with his personal
           advisers with whom she attended meetings;  and  in  Mr  Curtis's
           case, in various roles up to 6 hours  each  week,  not  only  at
           cricket events and but also in direct discussions at Mr Curtis's
           office.

       55) Mr Curtis gave compelling  evidence  in  distinguishing  between
           those of the applicant's claimed  age,  who  would  experiencing
           trauma or difficulties during the transition process  by  coming
           to his offices, even if not to speak, simply to be  around  him;
           as opposed those of the older, assessed age,  who  in  contrast,
           when  experiencing  trauma  or  difficulties,  might   typically
           disengage by simply not turning  up  to  meetings  and  becoming
           difficult to contact. Whilst Mr  Curtis  recognised  that  there
           could be a range of individual responses, he was  able  to  give
           this detailed and credible  example  of  why,  after  a  lengthy
           period of time in dealing with the applicant,  he  believed  the
           applicant was of the claimed rather than the assessed age.


       56)  The  compelling  evidence  of  Mr  Curtis  and  Ms  Kargar  was
           consistent with those outside a professional  setting  who  also
           had  significant  experience  of  observing,  talking  to,   and
           interacting  with  the  applicant  generally,  namely  the   Old
           Hamptonian Cricket Club volunteers, Mr Jaijee and Mr Khan.  Both
           have had regular dealings with him over the summer of  2018,  in
           particular.  Whilst  neither  have  professional  experience  as
           social workers, both have substantial experience in  interacting
           with children and young adults of the contested age range.  Both
           were willing to accept that  there  were  individual  levels  of
           maturity across the age range and that there might be  different
           behaviours because of language barriers and cultural background,
           but nevertheless both regarded the applicant  as  displaying  an
           immaturity of behaviour more consistent with  the  claimed  age.
           Examples were given of the applicant seeking to  bat  without  a
           helmet, when he knew he must.   Another example was the contrast
           of how an older person would react, when becoming impatient with
           the performance of fellow team members. If an older person  made
           an inappropriate remark, Mr Khan,  as  captain,  would  indicate
           that such behaviour was not acceptable, which they would readily
           acknowledge and change their  behaviour.  In  contrast,  younger
           children  would  continue  to  be  moody  or  display   negative
           attitudes  towards  fellow  players,  whose   performance   they
           faulted. No example was determinative, but each  observation  of
           Mr Khan and Mr Jaijee, observed  over  a  long  period  of  time
           albeit with less direct contact than Mr Curtis  and  Ms  Kargar,
           tended to be supportive of the claimed rather than the  assessed
           age.


       57) In contrast, whilst I do  not  question  the  integrity  of  the
           respondent's witnesses,  Mr  Haroon  did  not  have  any  direct
           dealings with the applicant, but merely reviewed  the  completed
           age assessment process. Ms  McGusty  Khoumeri  gave  honest  and
           considered evidence but nevertheless her interactions  with  him
           were limited to 3 single occasions over a very limited timeframe
           between 30 July and 10 September 2018. Ms McKenzie had even more
           limited dealings with the applicant, meeting him on  two  single
           occasions on 8 and 17 July 2009 in the context  of  the  unusual
           circumstances of  threats  to  the  applicant  and  she  herself
           conceded that she did not have an  opinion  on  the  applicant's
           age. I have already referred in large part to the points  raised
           by Ms Gregory in her witness statement.

       58) Mr Simon  Wade,  co-author  of  the  original  assessment,  also
           provided a witness statement at [H15] to [H19].  He  raised  the
           issues  of  the  applicant's  physical  maturity  and   apparent
           inconsistency about shaving, with which I have  dealt;   and  he
           made the general point that  the  applicant  did  not  have  the
           overall demeanour or presentation of somebody who claimed to  be
           (then) 15 years' old, albeit this was put in general  terms;  he
           responded that any difficulties with interpreting had  not  been
           raised and on the contrary the  applicant  had  been  given  the
           opportunity to say if he did not understand  all  the  questions
           put to him.  On balance, I find that the applicant did have some
           difficulties  with  the  language  interpreter  during  the  age
           assessment process,  albeit  this  did  not  cause  the  claimed
           inconsistencies.  As I have already identified, I do not accept,
           for the most part,  that  the  applicant  was  inconsistent,  as
           alleged. Nevertheless, I am prepared to accept, in the basis  of
           Ms Kargar's contemporaneous knowledge and oral evidence (and her
           honesty has not been challenged) that the applicant did complain
           to her at the time that  he  was  experiencing  difficulties  in
           understanding everything  that  was  said  to  him  in  the  age
           assessment interviews, because the interpreter was  a  Pakistani
           Pashtu interpreter as opposed to an Afghan  Pashtu  interpreter.
           Particularly in light of the concerns I had over the  extent  to
           which the assessment report and typed notes reflected accurately
           everything that the applicant said and whether he was  upset,  I
           do not accept as  reliable  the  generalised  statement  in  the
           assessment  report  at  [D7]  that  the   applicant   understood
           everything that was said; and instead I  find  that  there  will
           have been elements of what was said to and by him that  was  not
           conveyed by the interpreter.  I accept  as  plausible  that  the
           applicant himself may, having  initially  raised  concerns  over
           difficulties,  subsequently  have   become   resigned   to   the
           interpreter with whom he was provided, as he assumed that he had
           to 'make do' with a partially adequate interpreter.  That  being
           said, the issue of difficulties in interpreter is not central to
           my assessment of the applicant's credibility, given my  findings
           that his answers were broadly credible.


       Decision

       59) I have already identified what I regard as the weaknesses in the
           respondent's criticism of the applicant's credibility.  There is
           also the difficulty about the limited nature of the respondent's
           disclosure  of  handwritten  contemporaneous  records;  and  the
           disclosure such as it is, suggests  that  comments  in  the  age
           assessment  report  do  not  reflect  some  of  the  applicant's
           specific comments, for example in relation to how  he  explained
           his knowledge of the weekly allowance to which  he  believed  he
           was entitled.


       60) Standing back from the weaknesses in the respondent's  criticism
           of the applicant, and looking at the totality of  the  evidence,
           both for and against applicant, I have come  to  the  conclusion
           that it is more likely than not that the  applicant  is  telling
           the truth about his  age.  The  positive  aspects  of  his  case
           outweigh the negative aspects.

       61) Against the applicant  is  a  lack  of  credibility  in  certain
           aspects of his evidence, where I conclude that he has chosen not
           to be  frank,  in  particular  the  circumstances  in  which  he
           travelled  from  the  lorry  in  which  he  had   been   carried
           clandestinely to the SSHD's offices in Croydon.  I do  not  hold
           against the applicant that MS does not appear to have provided a
           full account of the circumstances of  the  applicant's  father's
           disappearance, in circumstances where the statement was provided
           in response to direct specific questions from Ms Kargar.   While
           I also have concerns about the plausibility of  the  applicant's
           account not to have tried to contact  his  mother  and  maternal
           uncle between November 2017 and January 2018, this does not,  in
           my view, strike at the heart of his claim about his age.

       62) The positive  aspects  include  the  broad  consistency  of  the
           applicant's account of fleeing Afghanistan,  albeit  noting  the
           limitations in that account;  the  circumstances  in  which  the
           applicant was likely  to  know  his  age,  being  somebody  with
           education and who was able to adequately  differentiate  various
           ages; the powerful evidence of Ms  Kargar  and  Ms  Curtis,  the
           caseworkers  from  the  Refugee   Cricket   Project,   who   are
           professionals and whose integrity was not  questioned  and  who,
           whilst not having age assessment qualifications,  were  able  to
           give detailed and specific reasons for why  they  believed  that
           the applicant was more likely to be of his claimed  age,  having
           observed him for a far greater period of time  than  either  the
           age assessors or the applicant's personal  advisers;  and  whose
           evidence was corroborated by the  Old  Hamptonian  Cricket  Club
           volunteers, who once again had regular dealings with  people  of
           the contested age range and were able to give specific examples.


       63) I attached no weight to the Taskera, whether in support  of  the
           claimed or assessed age, in light of its contents being based on
           physical appearance.

       64) I find that the applicant is more likely than not to  have  been
           born on 1 July 2002.
