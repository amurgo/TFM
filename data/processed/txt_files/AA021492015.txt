                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is an appeal brought with the permission of Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    Plimmer concerning a determination promulgated on 2 September  2015  by
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Ford.

2.   The appellant is a national of Nigeria who has a  lengthy  and  complex
    immigration history including asylum and refugee status claims, neither
    of which were considered to have any substance.

3.   The hearing in the  First-tier  Tribunal  focused  on  the  appellant's
    medical history and in particular the contention that were  she  to  be
    returned to Nigeria her health would be put at risk.

4.   The appellant suffered a cardiac  arrest  on  27  June  2011,  and  was
    diagnosed with "a life threatening arrhythmia". She was fitted with  an
    implantable cardioverter defibrillator  (ICD)  designed  to  prevent  a
    repetition. The judge records:

          "The appellant has supplied two letters dated June and  July  2013
         from  cardiologists  in  Nigeria  concerning  the  availability  of
         suitable treatment for [the appellant's]  condition  there.  I  was
         surprised not to see anything more up-to-date."

5.   Dr Osunki, a cardiologist at the National Hospital in  Abuja  indicates
    "a very high likelihood of fatality in the event  of  a  failure".   He
    states:

           "There  would  be  no  means  of  detecting  any  fault  in   the
         functionality of the device or knowledge of the wire frame  to  the
         heart. There is no  provision  for  replicable  components  of  the
         device in Nigeria.  If the device were to become  faulty  or  if  a
         battery were to become depleted this would not  be  replaceable  in
         Nigeria and the appellant would be at risk of sudden death."

    He refers to the appellant's mother dying from a related condition.

6.   At the heart of this appeal in this case is  the  allegation  that  the
    judge failed to take into  account  relevant  expert  evidence  and  in
    coming to his conclusion failed to give any or any adequate reason  for
    seemingly rejecting the expert evidence which was before him.

7.   This criticism relates to three key matters.  The first is  an  alleged
    misreading of an email from Miss Denise Coley, dealing  with  equipment
    which might be available in Nigeria. Miss Coley evidence, it  is  said,
    is misstated in the course of the determination.  The judge relates  at
    paragraph 32 that Miss Coley

          "... is a marketing professional with St Jude Medical UK  Limited.
         In her email at page 346 of the bundle she  states  that  there  is
         only one clinic in Nigeria which has a Merlin  programmer  supplied
         by the US.  She says 'at this time I  cannot  guarantee  that  this
         programmer has the  appropriate  version  of  software  to  support
         fortify ICDs'.  She  states  that  the  surgeons  have  had  little
         training on ICDs because none are currently implanted in Nigeria. I
         have not seen any follow up  correspondence  with  the  clinic   in
         question  to  ascertain  whether  the  Merlin  programmer  that  is
         available in  Nigeria  is  suitable  for  the  appellant's  ongoing
         monitoring or not."

8.   At paragraph 33 the judge continues

         "Miss Coley was asked whether hospitals in Nigeria have  access  to
         remote follow up and she says 'Nigeria is not supported  on  remote
         care as there are no ICD implants'.  She says that  this  does  not
         rule out the possibility of remote care being provided if there  is
         an individual in Nigeria with an ICD implant."

9.   I was taken by Ms Benitez to the full content  of  Miss  Coley's  email
    which reads as follows:

         "The clinics in Nigeria all have the older programmers which do not
         support the follow up of ICDs apart from one  clinic  which  has  a
         Merlin programmer supplied by  the  US.   At  this  time  I  cannot
         guarantee that this  programmer  has  the  appropriate  version  of
         software to support fortify ICDs [...] the surgeons have had little
         training on ICDs as  none  are  currently  implanted  in  Nigeria."
         (emphasis added)

10.  The second  matter  relied  upon  by  Miss  Benitez  are  letters  from
    clinicians in Nigeria.  In a letter dated 3  June  2013  from  Dr  A  O
    Salami, a consultant cardiologist at Lagos  State  University  Teaching
    Hospital, says this of the appellant:

           "The  only  current  known  treatment  is  with  an   implantable
         cardioverter defibrillator. This acts  as  a  safe  [sic]  net  and
         continuous   monitoring   of   the   heartbeat.   The   implantable
         cardioverter defibrillator is highly  specialist.  This  supportive
         therapy is not available  in  Nigeria.  However  patient  has  been
         benefiting from this supportive therapy abroad with  good  response
         to treatment and any  improxity  to  her  cardiologist  or  if  the
         patient travel out of the country where  this  facilities  are  not
         available may exacerbate her illness and lead to sudden death."

11.  The other letter is from a Dr D A Osunkwo who  is  a  chief  consultant
    cardiologist at the  National  Hospital  in  Abuja  and  he  makes  the
    following points.

    .    There is a lack of  the  cardiological  expertise  in  Nigeria  to
         diagnose this very rare heart condition

    .    There is lack of facilities and resources that  will  be  required
         for monitoring and follow-up

    .    There is a lack of research into this condition in Nigeria. It  is
         still a subject of ongoing clinical research in the developed world
         and it is currently poorly understood. The patient and  her  family
         are currently subjects partaking in a number of UK  based  research
         centres working on this condition.

    .    There is a lack of  the  medical  technology  for  monitoring  the
         interrogation of ICD, hence there would be a very  high  likelihood
         of fatality in the event of a failure.  There would be no means  of
         detecting any fault in the functionality of the device or knowledge
         of the wire frame to the heart.  There  is  no  provision  for  the
         replaceable components to the device in Nigeria.

    .    If her device were to become  non-functional  or  if  the  battery
         depleted this would not be replaceable in Nigeria and she would  be
         at risk of sudden death. Sadly I was informed that her mother  died
         of an unexpected sudden death from a related condition.

    .    There is no known effective tablet treatment  for  this  condition
         and therefore there will be  a  high  risk  of  fatality  and  poor
         prognosis if the treatment of her condition were to be  transferred
         to Nigeria. I strongly recommend that a condition  of  this  nature
         should be treated in the UK where the technology and expertise  are
         available for ongoing monitoring and follow up for  the  reason  of
         preservation of the patient's life as opposed to Nigeria.

12.  The third matter pursued  by  Miss  Benitez  is  that  the  judge  gave
    inadequate consideration to the content of a letter dated 22  May  2013
    from Dr  A  D  Staniforth,  a  consultant  cardiologist  at  Nottingham
    University Hospitals NHS Trust.  The salient part reads as follows:

         "On the basis of current medical knowledge  the  appellant  has  an
         indefinite/ lifelong ICD prescription.  The  device  needs  ongoing
         lifelong clinical monitoring.  In  Nottingham  we  perform  six  to
         twelve monthly clinic based tests. Our patients are also signed  up
         to remove wireless monitoring  so  we  can  know  within  24  hours
         whether a shock has occurred  or  a  life  threatening  device/lead
         fault is developing.  Wireless monitoring  is  internet  based  and
         requires a telephone line. The monitoring and follow up of ICDs  is
         highly specialist.  An ICD battery/generator has an  expected  life
         span of seven to nine years at which point replacement is required.
         The ICD also has a wire which is implanted in the heart. These  are
         subject to wearing out and need replacement every  ten  to  fifteen
         years. When replacing an ICD lead in a young patent it is customary
         to extract the existing lead.  This  too  is  a  highly  specialist
         procedure that requires an onsite cardiac surgery backup.   An  ICD
         generator has a hardware cost of around �12,000.   Procedure  costs
         for ICD replacement would approach �20,000. Hitherto the  level  of
         expertise for ICD follow-up within the UK has only  been  available
         with tertiary/university centres.  Over the last  couple  of  years
         this has started to spread to some of the larger district general."

13.  In my assessment, although the grounds of appeal are dressed up  as  an
    allegation of error of law, the real thrust of the appellant's argument
    before me is a disagreement on the  factual  conclusion  to  which  the
    judge came and to which, in my opinion, he was entitled  to  come.  The
    decision is careful, balanced and fully reasoned.  When  pressed,  Miss
    Benitez focused her criticisms on paragraphs 67, 68, 71, 80, 81 and  85
    of the decision, indicating that in  her  submission  those  paragraphs
    individually and collectively did not properly summarise the  evidence.
    Ms Benitez further contends that in the course of the determination  no
    reasons are given for departing from the expert evidence.

14.  I reject those criticisms. The judge carefully rehearsed, assessed  and
    weighed the expert evidence and then brought his material findings into
    the proportionality exercise which he  was  required  to  undertake  in
    determining the appellant's human rights claim. His  conclusions  might
    appear to be harsh, but judges  are  required  to  make  objective  and
    dispassionate evaluations and should not be swayed  by  sentiment.  The
    Upper Tribunal cannot interfere with findings of fact which  were  open
    to the Judge of the First-tier Tribunal.

15.  However, paragraph 71 reads as follows:

         "The appellant argued that ongoing monitoring, ICD device checks to
         be carried out remotely every three months, and annual check ups at
         which she need to be present are all essential to  her  health  and
         wellbeing.  She argues that she can only receive this treatment and
         monitoring if she is in the UK. In an email  at  page  346  of  the
         appeal bundle from Miss  Coley  who  works  for  St  Jude  Medical,
         manufacturer of the Merlin programmer used by  the  appellant,  she
         states that there is  a  clinic  in  Nigeria  which  has  a  Merlin
         programmer supplied by the US.  The appellant has not followed this
         up or if she has she has not produced the evidence  and  I  am  not
         satisfied that  she  cannot  have  access  to  the  programmer  for
         monitoring purposes if she is in Nigeria. Nor am I  satisfied  that
         the  programmer  is  unsuitable  for  monitoring  the   appellant's
         particular ICD.  I can see  no  reason  why  the  appellant  cannot
         travel overseas for an annual check-up. Although the appellant  and
         her sisters suggested that the appellant had  had  several  genuine
         scares  with  her  ICD  since  it  was  fitted  requiring   medical
         intervention I could see no medical evidence to  support  this  and
         although I accept that the appellant and/or  her  family  may  have
         asked for medical checks to be  conducted  on  her  ICD  I  am  not
         satisfied that those checks were  medically  necessary."  (emphasis
         added)

16.  The second part of paragraph 80 reads as follows:

         "[The appellant's] prognosis is  good  and  she  has  received  all
         relevant treatment for the time being. Her only real  complaint  is
         that the monitoring of the functioning of her ICD cannot be carried
         out in Nigeria as the  expertise  and  equipment  are  lacking.  As
         stated above, I am not satisfied that this is the case as  suitable
         monitoring equipment may be available  in  a  private  clinic.  The
         appellant  can  continue  to  travel  overseas   for   any   actual
         treatment." (emphasis added)

17.  An independent and free-standing criticism is made that by use  of  the
    word "may" in this passage, the judge is being drawn into  speculation,
    and it seems to be  ill-informed  speculation  because  the  judge  has
    failed to differentiate between a programmer  (which  is  mentioned  in
    paragraph  71)  and  monitoring  equipment  which  is  the  subject  of
    conjecture in paragraph 80.

18.  Not without considerable hesitation, I am narrowly persuaded that  this
    discrete matter of speculation amounts to a material error of  law.  It
    is pure speculation which is not grounded  by  the  evidence  that  the
    judge considered and which he assessed fully  and  comprehensively.  It
    confused  programming  equipment  which  Miss   Coley   addressed   and
    monitoring equipment which she did not.

19.  I have regard to the remarks of Lord Justice Moses giving  judgment  in
    MM (Zimbabwe) [2012] EWCA Civ 279 in which he stated:

         "The only case that I can foresee where  the  absence  of  adequate
         medical treatment in the  country  to  which  a  person  is  to  be
         deported will be relevant to Article 8 is where it is an additional
         factor to be weighed in the balance with  other  factors  which  by
         themselves engage Article 8.  Suppose in this  case  the  appellant
         had  established  firm  family  ties  in  this  country,  then  the
         availability of continuing medical treatment here coupled with  his
         dependence on the family  here  for  support  together  established
         private life under Article 8.  That conclusion  would  not  involve
         the  comparison  between  medical  facilities  here  and  those  in
         Zimbabwe. Such a finding would not affirm the  principle  expressed
         above that the United Kingdom is under no Convention obligation  to
         provide medical treatment here when it  is  not  available  in  the
         country to which the appellant is to be deported." (emphasis added)

20.  I am conscious that  the  totality  of  the  evidence  -  as  carefully
    assessed by the judge - militated in favour of the conclusion to  which
    he ultimately came and that even had the judge not  wrongly  speculated
    upon the availability of monitoring equipment in Nigeria he might  very
    well have come  to  precisely  the  same  disposal.  The  appellant  is
    perfectly able to travel for periodic check ups and for  treatment.  It
    is solely in relation to continuous daily monitoring where the  judge's
    otherwise impeccable analysis lapses momentarily into speculation. This
    is a factor which featured in the proportionality exercise and, in  all
    the circumstances, the interests of justice require that the First-tier
    Tribunal decision be  set  aside  and  the  matter  be  remitted  to  a
    different First-tier Tribunal Judge for a redetermination solely of the
    human  rights  claim.  The  First-tier  Tribunal'  findings  on  asylum
    grounds, humanitarian protection  grounds  and  under  the  Immigration
    Rules are preserved.

21.  Mindful of the very narrow and somewhat technical basis on  which  this
    appeal has succeeded,  the  appellant  should  be  aware  of  the  real
    prospect that a rehearing may nonetheless come to  the  precisely  same
    conclusion as the first judge did.


Notice of Decision

Appeal allowed on human rights grounds.

Human rights appeal remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for a rehearing.
