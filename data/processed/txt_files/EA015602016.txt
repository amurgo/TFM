Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is the appeal of Evangle [F], a  citizen  of  Cameroon  born  28
       December 1985, against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  of  9
       October 2018 to  dismiss  his  appeal,  itself  brought  against  the
       Respondent's decision of 27 January 2016 to  refuse  his  application
       for an EEA residence card.




  Introduction


    2. The Appellant's immigration history is that he  applied  for  asylum,
       which was refused and the ensuing appeal dismissed on 15 August 2003;
       further representations were refused on 21 December 2007.

    3. On 24 May 2008 the Appellant married Ms  C,  a  French  national,  in
       London; the marriage certificate specified her occupation as that  of
       au pair. On 21 July 2008 she gave birth to their daughter,  R.  On  7
       April 2010 he sought a residence card confirming his right to  reside
       as Ms C's spouse; one was issued, on 28 September 2010,  valid  until
       the same date five years  later.  Ms  C  subsequently  had  a  second
       daughter, of whom the Appellant is not the father.

    4. The  application  was  refused  because  the  documentation  said  to
       establish Ms C's exercise of Treaty rights, an HMRC  document  of  28
       July 2015 showing her employment history from  April  2010  to  April
       2015, did not in fact demonstrate that she had  consistently  worked,
       given that there appeared to be an employment gap from 20 August 2010
       until 1 February 2013. Furthermore there was no evidence that she was
       exercising free movement rights when the decree absolute was  issued:
       the document supposedly showing she worked for Comptoir Gourmand  Ltd
       at the point of divorce was a copy rather than an  original,  and  it
       was thus not capable of verification.

    5. The appeal has previously been heard by the First-tier Tribunal,  and
       remitted for hearing afresh. Nothing arises from that  save  for  the
       useful indication by Upper Tribunal  Judge  Storey  in  his  remittal
       decision of 31 January 2018 that that relevant considerations at  the
       re-hearing were likely to include


        a) Whether Ms C had been exercising Treaty rights for 5 continuous
           years during their marriage, in which case the Appellant would
           have established a permanent residence right;


        b) Whether she was working at the date of divorce, in which case he
           would be entitled to a retained right of residence: "it should
           be within the power of the claimant to produce the original of
           this letter and if he does that, that might then bring him
           within the material scope of Regulation 10".


  The First-tier Tribunal decision against which this appeal now lies


    6. The First-tier Tribunal heard oral evidence, which it summarised. The
       Appellant had been in continuous employment at Maloko Restaurant from
       2010 to 2015, and with Katakata Ltd from 2015 until now. He had  paid
       all his taxes. The HMRC had sent him a copy of their July 2015 letter
       in the course  of  2015,  after  his  former  wife  had  declined  to
       cooperate in obtaining evidence for his appeal by providing  her  own
       pay slips. Their relationship haf been on and off from 2011,  finally
       breaking down in 2012; nevertheless, he continued to see Ms C in  the
       course of dropping off their daughter R. He had called HMRC and  they
       had sent him the July 2015 letter, a copy of which he had used in his
       application to the Home Office, having given the original  letter  to
       his former representatives.


    7.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  concluded  that  the  Appellant  had  not
       demonstrated his former spouse had  been  exercising  Treaty  Rights.
       This was because the original HMRC document had  not  been  produced,
       and the explanation for how the copy had entered his  possession  was
       not credible. He had stated in oral evidence that he had obtained the
       letter from HMRC, that the original  had  been  handed  over  to  his
       previous representatives: but this was "not credible as a  matter  of
       law", given that it was addressed not to him but to Ms C. HMRC  could
       not have sent this to him without her consent, absent a Court  Order,
       because it would have breached data protection  legislation  and  the
       law of confidence. Accordingly the only credible explanation for  him
       having access to the document was that Ms C had given it to him - but
       that in  turn  undermined  his  account  of  her  having  refused  to
       cooperating in evidencing his case.

    8. That left the question as to whether Ms C had  been  working  at  the
       date that divorce proceedings were initiated  (the  Appellant  having
       stated the divorce petition was filed in  June  2012).  The  evidence
       indicated that she had been out of work  for  a  significant  period.
       Even treating her as having been on maternity leave for a  year  from
       her second child's birth in November 2010, up to November 2011,  this
       still left a significant period during which she  was  not  shown  to
       have worked. The only source of income was Job Seekers Allowance  for
       the tax year ending April 2012, and for that ending April  2013,  her
       employment with Comptoir Gourmand Ltd which began on 1 February 2013.



    9. Nor  had  Ms  C  been  a  qualified  person  when  the  marriage  was
       terminated: in the year ending 5 April 2015, she was shown as  having
       received zero pay from her employment with Comptoir Gourmand Ltd. The
       Judge noted that the Respondent had indicated willingness to  concede
       the fact that she had been working for Comptoir Gourmand Ltd  at  the
       time of  the  divorce,  presuming  the  original  HMRC  document  was
       available. However, the FTT took the view that the Respondent was not
       bound by that concession, contingent  as  it  was  on  that  document
       materialising. The information in the HMRC letter was consistent with
       her having worked instead for  Quaar  Group  Ltd  at  the  marriage's
       termination; but no payslips had been produced to confirm this, again
       leaving the copy status of the letter as unsatisfactory.

   10. Accordingly the question of whether  the  Appellant  had  established
       that he himself had been in continuous employment since the  date  of
       the decree absolute did not arise.

  Onwards appeal to the Upper Tribunal


   11. Grounds of appeal contended the First-tier Tribunal had erred in  law
       by


        a) Rejecting the Appellant's evidence of Ms C having been in work
           at the date of divorce, notwithstanding that the Respondent had
           made a concession to such effect, which should have been treated
           as leaving the Tribunal as functus officio;


        b) Acting unfairly by going behind that concession;


        c) Failing to appreciate that the receipt of Jobseekers Allowance
           had in fact constituted Ms C as a qualified person at the date
           the petition was filed (3 July 2012);


        d) Failing to have regard to Ms C having attained permanent
           residence as at November 2012, their relationship having begun
           in November 2007, before their marriage on 1 June 2008;


        e) Failing to have regard to Regulation 10(5)(d)(i) addressing
           whether the Appellant had established permanent residence via
           having a right of access to the child of a qualified person.


   12. Judge Parkes granted permission to appeal for the First-tier Tribunal
       on 3 January 2019.


   13. I raised the issue of the concession to which the First-tier Tribunal
       had alluded at the start of the hearing. It did not appear clearly in
       any written document, nor in the Home Office's submissions.

   14. Mr Adophy explained the source of the concession: Mr  Eaton,  counsel
       for the Secretary of State below, had noted in submissions  that  the
       original document had been forwarded to the Secretary of  State,  and
       that therefore the copy letter provided  to  the  Tribunal  could  be
       accepted as genuine. In Mr Adophy's submission, an advocate is freely
       entitled to make concessions which are then binding in the subsequent
       disposal of the appeal. In any event, he contended that the Secretary
       of State was duty bound to make enquiries into  the  authenticity  of
       this document if its bona fides was to be disputed.


   15. For the Secretary of State, Ms Jones submitted that the precise scope
       of the concession was not evidenced, and that Mr Adophy's description
       of it was inconsistent with the fact that the Tribunal  had  recorded
       in its decision that  Mr  Eaton  had  maintained  the  Home  Office's
       position as being to dispute the HMRC  letter's  authenticity.  There
       was no material unfairness here, and  the  concession  had  not  been
       pleaded with sufficient clarity;  it  was  not  appropriate  for  the
       advocate who had appeared below to seek to give oral evidence  as  to
       its contents without notice. Besides, no  material  unfairness  arose
       given that the Appellant had long been on notice that a copy document
       alone would not satisfy the Respondent of Ms C's exercise  of  Treaty
       rights.

  Decision and reasons

   16. The Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 in  so  far
       as relevant provide:

       "Family member who has retained the right of residence"


       10.- (1)   In these Regulations, "family member who has retained the
           right of residence" means, subject to paragraphs (8) and (9), a
           person who satisfies a condition in paragraph (2), (3), (4) or
           (5).


           ...


           (5)   The condition in this paragraph is that the person ("A")-


                (a)    ceased to be a family member of a qualified person or
                an EEA national with a right of permanent residence on the
                termination of the marriage or civil partnership of A;


                (b)    was residing in the United Kingdom in accordance with
                these Regulations at the date of the termination;


                (c)    satisfies the condition in paragraph (6); and


                (d)    either-


                    (i)      prior to the initiation of the proceedings for
                    the termination of the marriage or the civil
                    partnership, the marriage or civil partnership had
                    lasted for at least three years and the parties to the
                    marriage or civil partnership had resided in the United
                    Kingdom for at least one year during its duration;


                    (ii)     the former spouse or civil partner of the
                    qualified person or the EEA national with a right of
                    permanent residence has custody of a child of that
                    qualified person or EEA national;


                    (iii)    the former spouse or civil partner of the
                    qualified person or the EEA national with a right of
                    permanent residence has the right of access to a child
                    of that qualified person or EEA national, where the
                    child is under the age of 18 and where a court has
                    ordered that such access must take place in the United
                    Kingdom; or


                    (iv)     the continued right of residence in the United
                    Kingdom of A is warranted by particularly difficult
                    circumstances, such as where A or another family member
                    has been a victim of domestic violence whilst the
                    marriage or civil partnership was subsisting.


           (6)   The condition in this paragraph is that the person-


                (a)    is not an EEA national but would, if the person were
                an EEA national, be a worker, a self-employed person or a
                self-sufficient person under regulation 6; or


                (b)    is the family member of a person who falls within
                paragraph (a).


       Right of permanent residence


       15.- (1)   The following persons acquire the right to reside in the
           United Kingdom permanently-


                (a)    an EEA national who has resided in the United Kingdom
                in accordance with these Regulations for a continuous period
                of five years;


                (b)    a family member of an EEA national who is not an EEA
                national but who has resided in the United Kingdom with the
                EEA national in accordance with these Regulations for a
                continuous period of five years;


                ...


                (f)    a person who-


                    (i)      has resided in the United Kingdom in accordance
                    with these Regulations for a continuous period of five
                    years; and


                    (ii)     was, at the end of the period, a family member
                    who has retained the right of residence."

   17. Hamblen LJ in  IM  (Pakistan)  [2018]  EWCA  Civ  626  �23  helpfully
       reviewed various authorities relating  to  concessions  made  in  the
       course of immigration proceedings:

           "14   ... Carcabuk and Bla -v- Secretary of State for the Home
           Department [2000] Appeal No. 00TH01426 IAT at [11]-[12.5] and
           R(Ganidagli) -v- Immigration Appeal Tribunal [2001] INLR 479
           Admin) at [20]. In Carcabuk Collins J stated:


                "11.   It is in our judgment important to identify the
                precise nature of any so-called concession. If it is of fact
                (for example that ... an event described by the appellant or
                a witness did occur), the adjudicator should not go behind
                it. Accordingly, if facts are agreed, the adjudicator should
                accept whatever is agreed. Equally, if a concession is
                clearly made by a HOPO that an Appellant is telling the
                truth either generally or on specific matters, the
                adjudicator may raise with the HOPO his doubts whether the
                concession is appropriate but, if it is maintained, he
                should accept it ..."


           15.   It is to be noted that this authority recognises that, at
           least in some circumstances, a tribunal may raise doubts about a
           concession made and states that it is only if the concession is
           still maintained that the tribunal should accept it. The right
           of a tribunal to question concessions made is borne out by other
           authorities, as referred to below.


           23    ... neither the FTT nor the UT were bound to accept the
           concession made by the respondent in the RL. As stated in the
           case of Kalidas (agreed facts - best practice) [2012] UKUT 00327
           (IAC):


                '35.   Judges, unless in exceptional circumstances, do not
                look behind factual concessions. Such exceptional
                circumstances may arise where the concession is partial or
                unclear, and evidence develops in such a way that a judge
                considers that the extent and correctness of the concession
                must be revisited. If so, she must draw that immediately to
                attention of representatives so that they have an
                opportunity to ask such further questions, lead such further
                evidence and make such further submissions as required. An
                adjournment may become necessary.'"

   18. As made clear by  IM  (Pakistan),  concessions  are  not  necessarily
       binding on parties, and a Judge must always be  astute  to  determine
       the precise scope of any concession said to have made. In this  case,
       any  "concession"  appears  to  have  been   misunderstood   by   the
       Appellant's representative. The refusal letter stated

           "While the HMRC employment history document would  suggest  that
           the EEA national was working for Comptoir Gourmand  Ltd  at  the
           time of divorce, upon close inspection  it  is  clear  that  the
           document is a photocopy and as such cannot be solely relied upon
           as evidence in support of your application."

   19. Mr Eaton appearing for the  Secretary  of  State  below  had  clearly
       defended that refusal reason: as the First-tier  Tribunal  summarised
       his submissions �23, "the point made in the refusal letter held good.
       The appellant had not provided the original of the letter from HMRC."
       It is impossible to reconcile this submission  with  acceptance  that
       the HMRC document was sufficient for the Appellant to make  good  his
       case. There has been no  attempt  made  to  precisely  delineate  the
       Appellant's understanding of the terms of the concession in  writing,
       on notice to the Upper Tribunal and the Respondent.


   20. So I do not accept that there was here any "concession" in the  terms
       asserted by  the  Appellant.  It  may  well  be  the  case  that  the
       Respondent's  stance  below  was  that,  if  the  HMRC  document  was
       established as genuine, then it would establish that the  Appellant's
       ex-spouse had been exercising Treaty Rights as claimed. But there was
       no concession that the HMRC document was to be treated as if  it  was
       genuine.  Indeed, the Respondent's case was to the contrary.


   21. The absence of an original document is not necessarily  fatal  to  an
       appeal. If the explanation as to a document's provenance is accepted,
       then doubtless a fact-finder might accept it as genuine. But there is
       no rule of  law  that  compels  acceptance  of  a  document  from  an
       ostensibly official source notwithstanding that it is a  copy  rather
       than an original. Here, the explanation for how  the  Appellant  came
       into possession of the HMRC letter was found wanting  by  the  First-
       tier Tribunal.

   22. The Judge's thinking is  readily  comprehensible:  it  is  inherently
       unlikely, given the modern response  of  officialdom  to  obligations
       arising from data protection laws, that HMRC would release a document
       addressed to  Ms  C,  addressing  Ms  C's  working  history,  to  the
       Appellant. No error of law was asserted in the  reasoning  underlying
       that conclusion, save for the "concession"  argument,  which  I  have
       rejected.

   23. As to Mr Adophy's further submission that the Secretary of State  was
       bound to investigate the validity of the HMRC letter himself, Stanley
       Burnton LJ in Amos [2011] EWCA Civ 552 at �34ff explains  that  there
       is no rule of  European  Union  law  that  necessarily  requires  the
       Secretary of State to assist an Appellant to discharge the burden  of
       proof on them, and no domestic principle to that  effect  either.  He
       also noted that the Appellant had not suggested

           "40   ... that the procedural law of the Tribunal  hindered  her
           ability to prove her case. Rule 51 of the Asylum and Immigration
           Tribunal (Procedure)  Rules  2005  authorises  the  Tribunal  to
           "allow oral, documentary or other evidence to be  given  of  any
           fact which appears to be relevant to an appeal" ... even if that
           evidence would be inadmissible in a court of  law.  Furthermore,
           as Mr Eicke pointed out, Ms Theophilus could have applied  under
           regulation 50 for a witness summons requiring her ex-husband  to
           attend and give evidence as to whether or not  he  was  and  had
           been working. She did not do so. Nor did she  seek  a  direction
           under rule 45 requiring the Secretary of State  to  provide  any
           information necessary  for  the  determination  of  her  appeal.
           Indeed, she made no relevant application  to  the  Tribunal.  As
           Maurice Kay LJ pointed out in the course of argument,  in  these
           circumstances it is impossible to identify any error of  law  on
           the part of the Tribunal in this respect.


           ...


           42.   Kerr [v Department for Social Development [2004] UKHL  23]
           is not authority for the proposition  that  the  Department  for
           Social Development of Northern Ireland,  the  appellant  in  the
           appeal, was under any duty to obtain  information  available  to
           other government departments or authorities. Even if  transposed
           to the present context, it is not authority for the  proposition
           that the Home Secretary is bound  to  make  enquiries  of  other
           government departments for evidence they may  or  may  not  have
           concerning issues before the Tribunal."

   24. As can be seen from Amos �40, the appropriate  course  of  action  in
       such a case is to seek a direction from the  First-tier  Tribunal  to
       order HMRC to assist with the Appellant's enquiries (or to order that
       the Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department  to  use  his  best
       endeavours  to  secure  such  information).  However  there   is   no
       indication here that that course of action was  taken.  A  party  who
       declines to follow the appropriate procedural approach  for  securing
       relevant information runs the risk that judges will be  sceptical  as
       to their reasons for failing so to do.


   25. The Appellant's case as to Ms C's exercise of Treaty  rights  depends
       on the reliability of the  HMRC  letter  both  for  the  purposes  of
       establishing a claim based on 5 years' residence compatibly with  the
       EEA Regulations, and for making good his claimed  retained  right  of
       residence based on her being a qualified person at the moment divorce
       proceedings were initiated. Accordingly his claim in that  regard  is
       doomed to fail.

   26. The other grounds of appeal are misconceived. As to the ground I have
       identified as (d) at paragraph 11 above, pre-marriage cohabitation in
       a durable relationship cannot be counted towards satisfaction of  the
       five-year residence period absent the issue of a residence card as an
       extended family member for the relevant period: see Macastena  [2018]
       EWCA Civ 1558. There is no evidence here that such an application was
       made and granted.

   27. As to ground  (e),  any  entitlement  based  on  access  to  a  child
       (Regulation 10(5)(d)(iii)) simply gives  rise  to  another  route  by
       which a retained right of residence may be  asserted:  however,  that
       route requires that the  former  spouse  be  a  qualified  person  or
       individual with  permanent  residence,  a  status  which  once  again
       necessitates establishing the  exercise  of  Treaty  rights  for  the
       relevant period and/or at the relevant time. The inadequacies of  the
       HMRC letter, the sole independent evidence put forward  to  establish
       that proposition, bars the Appellant's ability to satisfy that  route
       as much as it does the primary case put under Regulation 10(5)(d)(i).




   28. I accordingly conclude that there is no material error of law in  the
       decision of the First-tier Tribunal and the appeal is  dismissed.  In
       the event that the Appellant obtains an original HMRC document in the
       future that establishes that Ms C's working history is as he  asserts
       it is, he is doubtless free to make a further application.


          Decision:

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains no material  error  of
    law.
    The appeal is dismissed.


      Signed:                                            Date:  25  February
