Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr A Alef (Maxim Solicitors)
For the Respondent:    Mr Tarlow


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 27  December  1990.   On
    29 January 2011 he was granted leave to enter the United Kingdom  as  a
    student until 31 December 2011.  He was studying business management at
    the  School  of  Business  and  Commerce.   He  completed  that  course
    successfully in December 2011.

2.   He made a further application for leave to remain which was refused  on
    11 November 2012 and the appellant's appeal from that decision  is  the
    subject of these proceedings.

3.   To deal with one important matter first,  it  was  initially  the  Home
    Office contention that the appellant  had  not  applied  prior  to  the
    expiry of his existing leave on 31  December  2011.   That  would  have
    meant he had no right of appeal against  the  decision.   However  this
    matter was resolved in the appellant's favour at  the  hearing  of  his
    appeal at the First-tier Tribunal on 13 March 2013.  There has been  no
    challenge to that aspect of the decision.  The  judge  found  that  the
    appellant had submitted the application  by  recorded  delivery  on  31
    December 2011.  The appellant's leave accordingly continued  by  virtue
    of the application and appeal process.

4.   However there was a further complication.  The  appellant  had  applied
    for leave to remain on the basis of his admission to Alexander  College
    in order to study a postgraduate  diploma  in  information  technology.
    Unfortunately that college had  its  sponsor  licence  revoked  by  the
    respondent.  On 21  June  2012  the  Secretary  of  State  invited  the
    appellant to submit a new Confirmation of Acceptance for  Studies  from
    another college and he was given 60 days to do so.  On 21 August  2012,
    within  the  allotted  period,  the  appellant  submitted  an   amended
    application with a new CAS from West City College in Rainham, Essex.

5.   The respondent refused the application on  maintenance  grounds  on  11
    November 2012.

6.   Unfortunately  for  the  appellant  he  was  unaware  that  during  the
    interval between his lodging  the  application  in  December  2011  the
    maintenance requirement had been made more onerous.  Instead of  having
    to show maintenance of �600 for two months for out of  London  colleges
    or �1,200, he needed �1,600.  The matter is complicated  by  virtue  of
    the fact that the appellant's application was initially to study at  an
    inner  London  college,  Alexander  College.   He  needed  to  show   a
    maintenance figure of �1,600 at that college at that time.

7.   It is perhaps not necessary to go  into  the  precise  figures  at  any
    great length because it is conceded by  Mr  Alef  that  the  judge  was
    correct to  hold  that  the  appellant  could  not  meet  the  relevant
    maintenance requirements of the Rules.  There is no dispute  about  the
    figures set out in  the  determination  subject  to  one  typographical
    correction in paragraph 15 where the figures for inner London and outer
    London colleges have become transposed.

8.   The  judge  noted  in  paragraph  31  of  the  determination  that  the
    appellant's Lloyds TSB bank statement which  accompanied  the  December
    2011 application at no stage indicated a balance exceeding  �1,250  for
    the requisite 28 day period proceeding the  date  of  the  application.
    When the appellant submitted the subsequent application the Lloyds  TSB
    statements similarly did not demonstrate possession  of  the  requisite
    funds for the requisite period.  This was because, as I have  explained
    before, the maintenance requirements had been raised in the intervening
    period.

9.   There was however further material before the First-tier  Judge.   This
    had not been placed before the respondent.  The appellant relied on  an
    overseas  Muslim  Commercial  Bank  account  in  Pakistan  which   held
    approximately �11,000 as of 20 August 2012.  The  judge  accepted  that
    those funds would have been available as at the  date  of  the  initial
    application.  However that did not assist the appellant with his appeal
    under the Rules, the material having not been put before the respondent
    at the proper time.  Accordingly the appeal under the Rules failed.

10.  In relation to Article 8 the judge directed  himself  by  reference  to
    Razgar [2004] UKHL 27 and referred to CDS Brazil [2010] UKUT 00305  and
    Pankina v Secretary of State [2010] EWCA Civ 719.  The judge found that
    the appellant had completed in December 2011 the course  of  study  for
    which he had been granted leave to  enter  the  United  Kingdom  -  the
    diploma  in  business  management.   The  studies  he  commenced   with
    Alexander were in the field of IT, which, while not a wholly  unrelated
    subject area was not one "which is obviously a career progression  from
    his initial course."  The determination concludes as follows:

         "40. Additionally, and by his own admission, the application  which
             the  appellant  submitted  in  December  2011  did  not   even
             demonstrate that the appellant held  the  requisite  funds  at
             that stage, namely the �1,600 referred to, for even  one  day,
             let alone  the  requisite  28  day  period,  even  though  the
             appellant  clearly  appreciated  that  he  was   required   to
             demonstrate  possession  of  �1,600  at  that  stage,  as   he
             completed the relevant box  in  the  application  form,  which
             confirmed this fact.  Whilst I appreciate and accept that  the
             appellant held some additional funds in his MCB  bank  account
             in Pakistan, he did not produce  any  evidence  of  possessing
             those funds to the respondent at any stage prior to the appeal
             itself.  Further, he has  still  not  produced  any  MCB  bank
             statement evidence which establishes precisely what  level  of
             funds he held in his MCB bank account in December 2011.


         41.  What is also clear, and not in  dispute,  is  that,  when  the
             appellant submitted his variation application in August  2012,
             he  still  did  not  provide  bank  statement  evidence  which
             established that he held  the  requisite  level  of  funds  in
             December 2011, although I accept that West City is  a  college
             outside inner London and that, had the  appellant  applied  to
             West City in December 2011, which he did not,  then  his  then
             produced Lloyds TSB bank statement would  have  established  a
             sufficiency  of  funding  for  that  course  at  that   stage.
             However, the fact is that the appellant did not apply to  West
             City in December 2011; rather,  he  applied  to  Alexander,  a
             college in Inner London.


         42.  In the present instance, the appellant was not admitted to the
             United Kingdom to follow a course which  has  not  yet  ended.
             Rather, he completed the course for which he was  admitted  to
             the United Kingdom and, since then, he has  not  been  granted
             leave to study any course at all, even  though  I  acknowledge
             that his leave to enter has been extended by virtue of section
             3C of the 1971 Act.


         43.  I accept that the appellant has now demonstrated that  he  has
             what would appear to be ample funds available, in relation  to
             his produced MCB statement, but  the  fact  is  that  the  MCB
             financial evidence has never been produced to  the  respondent
             until at, or shortly before, the appeal hearing itself.  Thus,
             the respondent cannot be criticised for  concluding  that  the
             requisite level of funding has not been demonstrated.


         44.  In all the circumstances I find that the respondent's decision
             does not have consequences of sufficient gravity  such  as  to
             engage Article 8 in relation to the appellant's  private  life
             established in the United Kingdom, bearing in  mind  that  the
             appellant was able to complete the course  for  which  he  was
             granted entry  clearance.   He  can  have  had  no  legitimate
             expectation that his leave  would  be  continued  beyond  that
             initial period; a conclusion reinforced by the fact  that  the
             appellant  did  not  provide  sufficient   evidence   to   the
             respondent to justify the grant of further leave in any event.




         45.  I have borne in mind the findings of the Court  of  Appeal  in
             its judgment in Pankina but the fact is that the appellant did
             not even demonstrate a sufficiency of  maintenance  funds  for
             one day during the requisite 28-day period  preceding  his  31
             December 2011 application and he did not produce any  evidence
             to the respondent, with his variation  application  of  August
             2012,  which  established  that  he  satisfied  the  requisite
             maintenance criteria even at that stage.


         46.  Thus, for the reasons I have given, I conclude that Article  8
             is not engaged.


         47.  What  is  clear  is  that  the  respondent's  decision  is  in
             accordance with the law, in the sense that  the  appellant  is
             unable to satisfy all of  the  requirements  of  the  relevant
             Rule.  The aim of that decision is clearly the maintenance  of
             a  sensible  and  consistent  immigration  control  policy;  a
             normally very weighty consideration indeed  and  one  which  I
             have taken fully into  account  in  undertaking  the  relevant
             balancing exercise.


         48.  In terms of proportionality, I have taken into account all  of
             the evidence and factors to which I have referred above, which
             include the fact that the appellant  has  clearly  expended  a
             significant proportion of funds in further  course  fees,  and
             there is no  suggestion  that  he  is  other  than  a  genuine
             student.  Further, it  is  no  fault  of  the  appellant  that
             Alexander lost its sponsor licence.  However, the fact is that
             the appellant at no  stage  had  leave  to  undertake  further
             studies in the United Kingdom, whether it be at  Alexander  or
             that West City, and he could  never  have  held  a  legitimate
             expectation that his leave to remain  in  the  United  Kingdom
             would be further extended.


         49.  The appellant is 22 years old, his family remain in  Pakistan,
             the appellant has benefited from some education in the  United
             Kingdom and, in any event, there is no reason known to  me  as
             to what he cannot submit an application for entry clearance to
             the United Kingdom, or elsewhere, from Pakistan, with  a  view
             to pursuing further studies, should he elect to do so.


         51.  I have borne in mind the reasoning of the House  of  Lords  in
             its judgment in Huang [2007] UKHL 11, and note that the Court,
             in that judgment, indicated that, in  circumstances  where  an
             individual  was  unable  to  satisfy  the  requirements  of  a
             relevant Rule, Regulation or similar, it was envisaged that it
             would be in very few cases  where  the  respondent's  decision
             relating to that individual  would  be  deemed  to  involve  a
             disproportionate interference with  that  individual's  rights
             under Article 8(2).  I entirely appreciate that this is not  a
             strict legal test but would add that the  evidence  before  me
             causes me to be satisfied,  based  upon  my  analysis  of  the
             particular facts and evidence relating to this appellant, that
             the  relevant  balancing  exercise   should   weigh   in   the
             respondent's favour, even  allowing  for  the  fact  that  the
             appellant excites some sympathy.


         51.  Consequently, and for the reasons I  have  given,  I  conclude
             that  the   respondent's   decision   does   not   involve   a
             disproportionate  interference  with  the  appellant's  rights
             under Article 8(2).  Thus, the appellant's  Article  8  appeal
             fails."


11.  At the hearing,  apart  from  CDS  (Brazil)  Mr  Alef  referred  me  to
    Adamally and Jaferi [2012] UKUT 00414 (IAC) and OA Nigeria [2008]  EWCA
    Civ 82.  Mr Alef submitted that the judge had not undertaken the proper
    balancing exercise in not considering that Article 8 was engaged.   The
    judge had not done justice to the case  of  CDS  and  had  only  partly
    quoted from it.  Quite apart from  the  fact  that  the  appellant  had
    applied in time he had been granted a further 60 day period  of  leave.
    He had been studying in the meanwhile.  There had been  progress  since
    he had started at level 5 and the second course  was  at  level  6  and
    would lead to an MBA in business administration.  The judge had taken a
    mistaken view of matters.

12.  The appellant had made a  mistake  about  maintenance  given  that  the
    Rules had changed in April 2012.

13.  The appellant had demonstrated ample resources  in  the  overseas  bank
    account.  He had been in the United Kingdom for two and  a  half  years
    and had made progress.  It was accepted that the judge's financial  and
    other calculations were correct.

14.  Mr Tarlow referred to the Home Office letter of 21 June 2012  informing
    the appellant of the  decision  to  revoke  the  licence  of  Alexander
    College.  It was not correct to say that the appellant had  been  given
    further leave to remain.  All that  had  happened  was  that  the  Home
    Office had suspended consideration of his  application  for  a  60  day
    period.  He relied on the reply that had been filed under Rule 24.  The
    findings made by the judge had been open  to  him.   He  had  correctly
    referred to the case of CDS (Brazil).  It was clear from  paragraph  44
    of the determination that the appellant  had  not  provided  sufficient
    evidence to the Secretary of State to  justify  the  grant  of  further
    leave in any event.  The determination was adequately reasoned in light
    of the previous findings.

15.  In respect of the point made in relation to the refusal  under  Section
    47 of the Immigration,  Asylum  and  Nationality  Act  2006  Mr  Tarlow
    withdrew such a decision had it been made.   In  order  to  effect  the
    removal of the appellant should his  appeal  be  unsuccessful  a  fresh
    decision would be made.

16.  I have carefully  considered  the  submissions  and  the  material  and
    authorities to which I was referred.  I can only upset the decision  of
    the First-tier Judge if it was flawed by virtue of  an  error  of  law.
    The fact that I  or  another  judge  might  have  reached  a  different
    decision is neither here nor there.

17.  The judge in my view did a very thorough  analysis  of  the  respective
    maintenance provisions at the different times involved  in  this  case.
    It does appear absolutely unarguable and indeed it is not  argued  that
    at any stage the appellant could have fulfilled the requirements of the
    Rules on the material presented to the Secretary of State.

18.  It is acknowledged that the appellant made a mistake about  the  change
    in the requirements of  the  Rules.   It  is  perhaps  worth  reminding
    oneself that  we  are  not  dealing  with  someone  who  is  untutored,
    illiterate or without education.  We are dealing with a student who  is
    proceeding with a course of business management.   He  would  have  the
    benefit of colleagues and assistance and could always ask if he  needed
    help.  It is worth while pointing out that in the  letter  of  21  June
    2012 information is provided and it includes the information  that  for
    an application to vary to be successful "the student will need to  show
    that he meets the requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules  which  are
    effective on the day that  he  makes  the  application  to  vary.   [My
    emphasis]  The latest version of the Immigration Rules are available on
    our website ..." and then particulars are given of the website.

19.  There are limits to what can be done to help an appellant  particularly
    when that appellant is an educated adult pursuing a course in  business
    management.

20.  The circumstances in CDS were somewhat different.  In the Secretary  of
    State's Rule 24 response it was submitted  that  the  appellant's  case
    could be distinguished from CDS.  In that the case the  Tribunal  found
    that the appellant had sufficient funds available under the Immigration
    Rules and so recourse to Article 8 was not necessary for the Tribunal's
    decision.  In this case there is no question of the  appellant  meeting
    the requirements of the Rules.  In  CDS  the  Secretary  of  State  had
    relied on the guidance rather  than  the  Rules  which  was  no  longer
    possible after Pankina.  In paragraph 21 of the decision  the  Tribunal
    refers to the "somewhat arbitrary provisions of guidance attached to an
    appendix to the Rules".  This was in the Tribunal's  judgment  somewhat
    less than a failure to meet a central requirement of the Rules.  It  is
    now the position that all the points relied  on  by  the  Secretary  of
    State were in the Rules and it is acknowledged that the appellant fails
    under the Rules.

21.  Mr Alef places central emphasis on the point that  the  judge  did  not
    conduct a proper balancing exercise and was wrong to find that  Article
    8 was not engaged.

22.  In my view that is not the  correct  way  to  read  the  determination.
    Despite what he says in paragraph 46 it is plain that the judge in fact
    went onto consider all relevant  circumstances  and  conducted  a  full
    balancing exercise in paragraphs 47 to 51 which I have set  out  above.
    The judge had well in mind  the  fact  that  the  appellant  had  spent
    significant money, was a genuine student and that it was  no  fault  of
    his that the college had lost its licence.  He  acknowledged  that  the
    appellant's circumstances excited some sympathy.  He  plainly  had  all
    relevant considerations in mind on the appellant's side.  I do not find
    that the judge neglected any relevant part of the guidance in CDS.   He
    sets out the relevant part of the head note in paragraph 37 and  it  is
    nothing to the point that he chose to highlight two parts of that  head
    note in paragraph 38.  It does not indicate that he did  not  have  all
    the guidance  in  mind  including  the  reference  to  ample  financial
    resources.  The judge indeed refers in paragraph 43 to the ample  funds
    available.

23.  In my view it was open to the judge to conclude, having found that  the
    appellant did not meet the relevant requirements of the Rules, that the
    decision of the respondent was not disproportionate and to resolve  the
    balancing exercise to which he makes reference in paragraph 50  against
    the appellant.

24.  When the determination is read as a whole I am not  satisfied  that  it
    is flawed in law for the reasons advanced.  This appeal fails.

Upper Tribunal Judge Warr
