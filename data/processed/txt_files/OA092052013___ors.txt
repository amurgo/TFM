Representation:

For the Appellants:    Mr A Mills, of Counsel instructed by Messrs Indus
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr I Jarvis, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellants, a mother born on 16 September  1966  and  her  children
    born on 18 January 1995, 23 October 1996, 2 February 1998 and  10  July
    1999 appeal, with permission, against a decision of Judge of the First-
    tier Tribunal Broe who in a determination promulgated on 25 April  2014
    dismissed their appeals against  a  decision  of  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer, Islamabad, to refuse them entry clearance to come  to  Britain
    as the wife and children of MI, a British citizen.

2.   The notice of refusal was on the basis  that  the  appellants  had  not
    shown that the sponsor met the income  requirements  in  the  rules  of
    �29,600.  The documentary evidence provided by the appellants had shown
    that the sponsor had been in each of two employments for less than  six
    months and the refusal stated that the income from the two  employments
    was  �11,341  per  annum.   The  respondent   therefore   refused   the
    applications under the provisions of paragraph EC.B.1.1(d) of  Appendix
    FM.  The  respondent  stated  that  the  appellants  had  not  provided
    specified documents to support the application.

3.   With the notice of appeal a letter from Dawn Cardington, the  sponsor's
    first employer was produced which gave his gross wages and bonus.  Also
    produced was a contract of employment dated 21 December 2012.  Payslips
    for Dawn Cardington for 15 December 2012 to 23  March  2013  were  also
    produced.  Payslips from  A  &  S  (the  appellant's  second  employer)
    between 13 January 2013 and 5 April 2013 were produced as well as  bank
    statements from 30 November 2012 to 27 February 2013.  It  was  claimed
    that the sponsor worked as  a  meat  cutter  with  Dawn  Cardington  in
    Bedfordshire with  an  annual  income  of  �19.744.40  and  also  as  a
    butcher/meat cutter at A & S Food Store in Luton for  which  he  earned
    �10,296.  He also had savings of �5,182.11.

4.   At the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal it was  accepted  by  the
    Presenting  Officer  that  the  income  from  the  two  employments  of
    �11,341.30 on which the respondent relied was a  figure  for  which  no
    basis could be found.

5.   The sponsor stated that he had submitted the application on  9  January
    2013 by which time he had been in both his jobs for over six months and
    therefore argued that it was wrong to refuse the  applications  on  the
    basis that he had not been in the jobs for  a  six  month  period.   He
    accepted that the letters put forward had not given his gross  salaries
    but said that these could be calculated from  his  payslips.   He  said
    that his gross earnings from Dawn Cardington for the period 6 June 2012
    to 6 June 2013 were �20,351 and from 2 July 2012 to 2 July 2013 he  had
    earned �11,799 from A & S, giving total earnings of  �32,150.   He  had
    produced from P60s from both employers.  It appears to have been argued
    before the  First-tier  Judge  that  relevant  documentation  had  been
    produced but, if it had not, then evidential  flexibility  should  have
    applied.

6.   In paragraphs 16 onwards of the determination the  judge  set  out  his
    findings of fact.  He stated, in paragraph 17 that, on the face  of  it
    the evidence before him showed that the sponsor's income  exceeded  the
    figure required for entry clearance.  However, the   judge  found  that
    the evidence had not been provided in the relevant form.   He  referred
    to the requirements of Appendix FM-SE of the Rules which  set  out  the
    number of payslips required stating  that  they  were  required  for  a
    period of six months prior to the date of application if the person had
    been employed by their current employer for at  least  six  months  and
    that a letter from the employer  who  issued  the  payslips  should  be
    produced confirming the person's employment and  gross  annual  salary,
    the length of their employment, the period over which they  were  being
    or were paid the level of salary relied upon in the application and the
    type of employment.  Moreover personal bank statements corresponding to
    the same period as the payslips showing that the salary had  been  paid
    into an account in the name of the person or in the name of the  person
    and their partner jointly should be produced.

7.   The judge considered the evidence relating to the sponsor's  employment
    with Dawn Cardington with A & S Food Store.   He  stated  that  neither
    letter confirmed the gross annual salary and that the  Dawn  Cardington
    letter also failed to state the period during which the  appellant  had
    received the salary relied on.  The documentary  evidence  required  by
    Appendix FMSE had therefore not been produced and the appeals could not
    therefore succeed under the Rules.

8.   The judge then turned to the issue of  the  Article  8  rights  of  the
    appellants and  in  particular  noted  the  approach  set  out  in  the
    determination of the Tribunal in Gulshan  (Article  8  -  new  rules  -
    correct  approach)  [2013]  UKUT  00640  (IAC).   He  referred  to  the
    structured approach set out by Lord Bingham in Razgar  [2004]  UKHL  27
    and, having placed weight on the fact that the sponsor had lived  apart
    from his family for many years, and although he  accepted  that  family
    life existed between them, he stated that that was the  life  that  the
    sponsor had chosen  and  that  life  would  continue  and  he  was  not
    persuaded that there was any interference with the right  to  enjoy  it
    and therefore Article 8 was not  engaged.   The  appeal  was  therefore
    dismissed on both immigration and human rights grounds.

9.   Grounds of appeal were submitted which argued that the judge had  found
    that the evidence was such that "on  the  face  of  it"  the  sponsor's
    income exceeded the figure required for the family and therefore stated
    that the appellants' case was  made  out  and  therefore  there  was  a
    material error of law.  The grounds went on to say at the time  of  the
    preparation of the case in October  2012  the  sponsor  had  only  been
    employed by Dawn Cardington for four months and therefore  it  had  not
    been possible for the employer to provide any  gross  figures  for  his
    annual earnings.  The employer had further clarified his position in  a
    letter of 16 May 2014 which was attached to the grounds.  Moreover, the
    sponsor's second employer had been in a similar situation and that  was
    now clarified in a further enclosed letter.  It was  claimed  that  the
    Entry Clearance Officer should have applied paragraph  D(b)(i)(dd)  and
    D(e)  and  ought  to  have  asked  for   up-to-date   information   and
    continuation of the payslips were already available to him.

10.  It was claimed that  additional  documents  had  been  submitted  which
    showed the appellant's earnings and it was further claimed  that  there
    had been no Entry Clearance Manager's review and that had that happened
    the matter could have been resolved without an appeal hearing.

11.  Permission to appeal was granted by Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Chambers who considered that the  grounds  were  arguable.  A  Rule  24
    statement from  the  respondent  stated  that  the  appellant  had  not
    provided the relevant proof of income.

12.  At the hearing of the appeal before me Mr  Mills  emphasised  that  the
    judge had found that the sponsor met the relevant  income  requirements
    and stated that the judge had taken no issue with the adequacy  of  the
    payslips supplied but further went on to argue  that  the  decision  to
    find that the interference with the appellants' rights under Article  8
    was proportionate was wrong.

13.  It was argued that both Dawn Cardington and A &  S  Food  had  provided
    letters saying it was not possible to  provide  the  sponsor  with  the
    gross annual earnings as he had only been employed on 6 June 2012 and A
    & S Food had stated that the appellant had only been employed for  five
    months and therefore they could not provide the relevant evidence.

14.  The skeleton argument went on to set out the terms of  Appendix  FM-SE,
    part D of the Rules, regarding specified documents before stating  that
    evidential  flexibility  should  have  applied  and  referring  to  the
    judgment of the House of Lords in Chikwamba [2008] 1 WLR 1420 in  which
    Lord Scott had stated that:

         "Policies that involve people cannot be, and should not be  allowed
         to become, rigid and flexible  rules.   The  bureaucracy  of  which
         Kafka wrote cannot be allowed to take root in this country and  the
         courts must see that it does not."


15.  It was stated that it was in the best interests of the children  to  be
    raised by both parents.

16.  It was also argued that there was "procedural  legitimate  expectation"
    -  the  expectation  of  the  sponsor  that  having  obtained   British
    nationality he would be able to bring his wife and children to  Britain
    to live with him here.

17.  Mr Mills, in his oral submissions emphasised that rules should  not  be
    raised to the point of dogma and referred to the arguments  before  the
    Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  that  evidential  flexibility  was
    relevant.  He referred  to  the  evidence  including  a  letter  of  27
    December 2012 which he stated had been sent with the grounds of  appeal
    in April 2013 but additionally had been in the bundle before the  judge
    dated 9 December 2013.  That letter  dated  from  before  the  date  of
    decision in March 2013 and was therefore relevant and should have  been
    taken into consideration.  He stated it was an error of the  First-tier
    Judge not to consider that letter which was relevant,   which  set  out
    the gross wages of the sponsor and his weekly bonus and which read with
    the other documentary  evidence  showed  the  length  and  duration  of
    employment.  While he conceded that payslips were  missing,  when  read
    together he stated that it was evident the financial requirements  were
    met.  He accepted however that the bank statements did not always  show
    the amounts of pay  received  -  these  were  only  relevant  after  30
    November.

18.  He accepted that the payslips from A & S  were  not  reflected  in  the
    bank accounts and stated that was because the sponsor had been paid  in
    cash.  He went on to argue that when interpreting the  requirements  of
    the Rules it was important to take into account the  practicability  of
    providing relevant documentation when payments and cash were made.   It
    would be almost impossible to track payments directly into the  account
    and it was not reasonable to expect that the sponsor would always  have
    paid in the exact amount.  Therefore the  Rules  would  be  interpreted
    some flexibility.

19.  He went on to state that there were, moreover, two principal errors  of
    law in the determination firstly with regard to  the  approach  of  the
    judge to the issue of Article 8 where he had not properly placed weight
    on the best interests of the children and  although  he  accepted  that
    Section 55 of the 2009 Borders Act did not apply,  it  was,  he  argued
    relevant to place particular weight on that factor.  He stated that the
    sponsor had had indefinite leave to remain under the  legacy  programme
    and had spent many years away from the children having come to  Britain
    in November 1999.  He asked me to find  that  the  decision  to  refuse
    entry clearance to the children was not in accordance with the law.

20.  He went on to argue the issue  of  legitimate  expectation  that  there
    would have been a review of the decision and  another  chance  for  the
    appellant to put his case.  He finally emphasised that  the  P60  forms
    had  been  before  the  First-tier  Judge  and  stated  that  that  was
    sufficient evidence for the judge to have found that the terms  of  the
    Rules were met.  The reality was that the sponsor's income  was,  on  a
    pro rata basis, �31,500 as at the date of decision.

21.  Mr Jarvis started by stating that he accepted that at the date  of  the
    application the sponsor had been employed by both Dawn Cardington and A
    & S for six months as he had started at Dawn Cardington on 6 June  2012
    and at A & S on 2 July 2012.  It was therefore acceptable  to  look  at
    the six months of income for the period up to the date of decision.  He
    stated, however,  that the requirements of the Rules  -  the  specified
    documents  required  included  both  wage  slips  and,  at  requirement
    A1(2)(a)(1)  as well as a letter from the employer at requirement  2(b)
    (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv).  He stated that there  was  no  letter  from
    Dawn Cardington which met the requirements of the Rules at  (2)(b)(ii).
    Moreover the requirement that the payments be shown  in  the  sponsor's
    bank account at requirement 2(c) had not been met.  He stated that  the
    Rules were logical and sensible.  It  was  important  that  the  actual
    earnings of a sponsor were corroborated in the way that the  Rules  set
    out to ensure that the sponsor had been paid and had received the money
    which would bring the appellants within the financial  requirements  of
    the Rules.

22.  He went on to say that the determination in Mundeba and  the  arguments
    relating to Section 55 of the Borders Act 2009 were not in the  written
    grounds and he asked me to find that it was too late for  Mr  Mills  to
    ask that the grounds be amended.  What was relevant was the decision of
    the First-tier Judge and the arguments before  him.   I  any  event  he
    stated that the exceptional provisions of Appendix FM were framed  with
    Section 55 in mind.  With regard to the issue  of  legitimate  fairness
    there was nothing that required a review.  There was no  public  policy
    that was infringed by the fact that the decision had not been reviewed.
     He argued that there was  no  issue  of  evidential  flexibility  with
    regard to the financial requirements of the  Rules.   The  reality  was
    that the terms of the Rules were not met and that the decision  was  in
    accordance with the Rules and in accordance with the law.

23.  The further letter from Dawn Cardington was  not  evidence  before  the
    First-tier Judge nor before the respondent.  The reality  was  that  on
    the evidence before the judge was that the requirements  of  the  Rules
    were not met.

24.  In reply Mr Mills referred to the issue of evidential  flexibility  and
    stated that that should have been applied to the decision and asked  me
    therefore  to  find  there  were  material  errors  of   law   in   the
    determination of the First-tier Tribunal.

Discussion

25.  The grounds of appeal raise a number of  matters  which  can  be  dealt
    with in short form.  The reality is that there is no obligation  on  an
    Entry Clearance Manager to review a decision when the grounds of appeal
    are received and that the public policy to  ensure  that  there  is  an
    independent challenge to the conclusions of the Entry Clearance Officer
    is the appeals system of which those appellants took advantage.

26.  Moreover, with regard to the requirements of the Rules, these were  not
    points-based  systems  and  therefore  the  provisions  to  which   the
    determination of the Tribunal and indeed  the  later  judgment  of  the
    Court of Appeal in Rodriguez do not apply.  The Rules  are  drafted  in
    strict form requiring evidence and there is a clear rationale  for  the
    terms of the Rules where an individual has not  worked  in  a  job  for
    twelve months - it is important that there is  corroboration  of  money
    that is paid particularly when  money  is  paid  in  cash.   It  is  of
    assistance when assessing the ability  of  a  sponsor  to  support  his
    dependants that the sums claimed to have been paid have  actually  been
    received  by  the  sponsor.   The  judge  found   that   the   relevant
    documentation had not been provided  and  that  finding  has  not  been
    challenged.  The appellants could not succeed under the Rules.
27.   I note the terms of  Appendix  FM-SE  -  which  relates  to  specified
    evidence where at D(ii)(e) it states:-


        "Where the decision maker is satisfied that there is a valid reason
        why specified document(s) cannot be supplied, e.g.  because  it  is
        not issued in the particular country or has been permanently  lost,
        he or she may exercise discretion not to apply the requirement  for
        the document(s) or to request alternative or additional information
        or document(s) be submitted by the applicant."


    That rule, which sets out the basis on which the  issue  of  evidential
    flexibility can be applied, simply does not cover  the  situation  this
    appeal where the evidence has not been provided  but  could  have  been
    available.


28.  Turning to the issue of the Article 8 rights of the appellant I  accept
    Mr Jarvis's submission that it was not argued in the grounds of  appeal
    that the judge had erred in his approach because he had not applied the
    ratio of the determination in Mundeba.  The reality  is  that,  in  any
    event, while it is the case that in general terms it is  best  for  the
    four children to be brought up by two parents  this  sponsor  made  the
    decision that he was going to leave Pakistan, leaving his children with
    his wife and that she was to bring them up.  That she did.  Their  life
    is in Pakistan, they do not speak English and it  is  clearly  arguable
    that the best interests of the children are to remain in Pakistan.   If
    the sponsor wishes to live with the children then of course he  can  do
    so there.  Following the ratio of  the  determination  in  Gulshan  the
    reality is that it is only in exceptional circumstances that  it  would
    be appropriate to go behind the  terms  of  the  Rules  and  I  do  not
    consider that such exceptional circumstances exist  given,  as  I  have
    said, that the children have been brought up by their mother  and  have
    lived in Pakistan all their lives.

29.  I therefore find that the judge was entitled not only to find that  the
    terms of the Rules had not been met  and  that  the  appeal  should  be
    dismissed under the Rules but also that the refusal of the applications
    was not a disproportionate breach of the rights of the appellants under
    Article 8 of the ECHR.

30.  I therefore find that the decision of the First-tier  Judge  dismissing
    this appeal on both immigration and human rights grounds shall stand.

Upper Tribunal Judge McGeachy
