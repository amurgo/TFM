Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr S Whitwell, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    no appearance


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. Although this is an appeal by the Secretary of State I  will  refer  to
    the parties as they were in the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. The appellant, a  citizen  of  Pakistan,  appealed  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal against a decision of the Entry Clearance Officer (ECO)  dated
    24 July 2013 (as amended by a further decision dated 2 September  2014)
    to refuse his application for entry clearance to the UK  as  a  spouse.
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Joshi allowed the appeal.  The  Secretary  of
    State appeals with permission to this Tribunal.

 3. There was no appearance by or on behalf of the appellant at the hearing
    before me. I was satisfied that the appellant and the sponsor had  been
    notified of the hearing and I considered that it was in  the  interests
    of justice to proceed with the  hearing  despite  the  absence  of  the
    appellant and I did so in accordance  with  Rule  38  of  the  Tribunal
    Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.  I  heard  submissions  from  Mr
    Whitwell.

 4. The issue in this appeal is narrow as  there  is  only  one  ground  of
    refusal identified  in  the  second  refusal  notice.  This  is  almost
    identical to the reason identified  in  the  first  refusal  notice  in
    relation to the financial requirements of the Immigration  Rules.  This
    is that the appellant had failed  to  provide  one  of  the  pieces  of
    specified evidence required by Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules, ie
    personal  bank  statements  for  the  6  month  period  prior  to   the
    application showing that the salary detailed in the wage slips for  the
    same  period  has  been  paid  into  the  sponsor's  account.  The  ECO
    considered that the bank statements provided  did  not  show  that  the
    sponsor had deposited her full net  earnings  into  her  account  on  a
    weekly basis and decided that the appellant had not therefore  provided
    all  of  the  specified  evidence  and  did  not  meet  the   financial
    requirements.

 5.  At  the  hearing  in   the   First-tier   Tribunal   the   appellant's
    representative submitted that in order to comply  with  the  Rules  the
    sponsor had to show 6 months bank  statements  prior  to  the  date  of
    decision. Whilst the Judge correctly states at paragraph  19  that  the
    relevant period is 6 months before the date  of  the  application,  the
    evidence he went on to consider at paragraph 21 relates to  the  period
    between March and September 2014 which was before the second  decision.
    The Judge went on to conclude that the appellant  had  shown  that  the
    sponsor  earned  ï¿½11,227.82  net  in  the  six  months  prior  to   the
    respondent's decision and that the appellant met  the  requirements  of
    the Rules.

 6. The respondent's grounds of appeal to the Upper Tribunal  contend  that
    the First-tier Tribunal Judge  erred  in  considering  bank  statements
    which post-date the application.

Error of law

 7. As a starting point I note that Appendix FM-SE requires that  specified
    evidence must be provided with the application. It is obvious therefore
    that evidence relating to the date of the decision cannot  be  relevant
    in this context. Further, paragraph 2 of Appendix FM-SE  sets  out  the
    evidence to be provided in relation to salaried employment  in  the  UK
    and requires, inter alia, the provision of payslips covering the period
    of 6 months prior  to  the  date  of  application  and  personal  banks
    statements corresponding to the same period showing  the  salary  being
    paid into an account in the sponsor's name.

 8. This appeal was somewhat complicated by the fact  that  the  respondent
    issued two decision notices. However they are in essence  the  same  in
    relation to the core financial issue. I further note that the appellant
    seems to have lodged the appeal in December 2013 some five months after
    the first decision. However no issue was taken  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal or before me in relation to jurisdiction.

 9. In light of the provisions of the Rules the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    erred in that he misdirected himself in law  in  considering  the  bank
    accounts for the period before the  decision  rather  than  the  period
    before the application. In light of the nature of the error which  goes
    to the heart of the only issue in this appeal I set aside the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal.

Remaking the decision

10. In remaking the decision I firstly take into account the correspondence
    sent by the sponsor to the Upper Tribunal in advance of the hearing. In
    her letter dated 27 August 2015 the sponsor says that she is no  longer
    sponsoring the appellant. This obviously raises new  issues  about  the
    genuineness of the relationship and the intentions of  the  parties  to
    live together.

11. As stated above the sole issue in the second refusal notice is  whether
    the appellant has demonstrated that he met the evidential  requirements
    in terms of the evidence of the lodgement of the appellant's  wages  in
    her bank account. Mr Whitwell provided  a  copy  of  the  statement  of
    Immigration Rules dated 13 March 2014 (HC1138) referred to by  the  ECO
    in the second decision. Paragraph 204 of HC1138 introduced an amendment
    to Appendix FM-SE in relation to all applications decided on or after 6
    April 2014 as to the treatment deposits of cash income.

12. I have considered the documentary evidence in the respondent's  bundle.
    It is unclear what documents were submitted with  the  application  and
    whether  any  were  submitted  with  the  appeal.  In  any  event   the
    respondent's bundle contains statements relating to three Barclays Bank
    statements in the sponsor's name. These  statements  cover  the  period
    from 4 August 2012 until 28 March 2013. None of these  statements  show
    deposits consistent with  the  wage  slips  over  the  period  covered.
    Further, the bank statements do not cover  the  period  from  28  March
    until the application was lodged on 14 April 2013.

13. There are further Barclays Bank statements in  the  appellant's  bundle
    but these relate to periods of time long before and after the  relevant
    six month period.

14. On the basis of the evidence before me I cannot be satisfied  that  the
    appellant met the requirements of the Rules at the date of the decision
    appealed against. In these circumstances I dismiss the appeal.

Conclusion:

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error on point of law.

I set the decision aside and remake it by dismissing the appeal.
