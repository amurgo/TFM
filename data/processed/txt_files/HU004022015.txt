                      ERROR OF LAW FINDING AND REASONS




     1. The appellant appeals with  permission  a  decision  of  First-tier
        Tribunal Judge Feeney who in  a  decision  promulgated  on  the  10
        October 2019 dismissed the appellants appeal.



Background


     2. The appellant is a citizen of Angola born on the 18 May 1991.
     3. The Judges findings are set out from [21]  of  the  decision  under
        challenge. At [21] the Judge writes:


             21.   In  the  particular  circumstances  of  this  case   the
                  appellant has convictions for using threatening,  abusive,
                  insulting words or  behaviour.   He  was  sentenced  to  a
                  community order in 2012. The next two offences took  place
                  in 2017 for assaulting a constable and a  further  offence
                  on the same day of ABH for  which  he  received  suspended
                  sentences of imprisonment and then in 2018 for failing  to
                  provide  a  specimen  for  analysis  for  which   he   was
                  disqualified from driving for 14 months (reduced if course
                  completed).  The  refusal  letter  focused  on  the  Nexus
                  evidence and that the appellant had been convicted  of  an
                  offence which caused serious harm.  Ms Godfrey also sought
                  to argue that this appellant could be considered to  be  a
                  persistent offender.


     4. The respondent made an order for the  appellants  deportation  from
        the UK on 10 May 2015. The appellant claimed that  his  deportation
        will breach his rights pursuant to article 8 ECHR.
     5. The Judge noted the appellant accepted his convictions as  recorded
        in the PNC [25].
     6. The Judge examines the evidence relating to other  relevant  police
        encounters  finding  on  the  balance  of  probabilities  that  the
        appellant did rob a  victim  on  10  August  2009  [27],  that  the
        appellant did rape a female on 16  November  2009  [28],  that  the
        appellant did rob another victim on 12 October 2011 [29], and  that
        the appellant did commit the offence of common assault  battery  on
        11 August 2013 [31].
     7. The Judge did not find the appellant responsible for other offences
        as detailed at [32 (a) - (h)] for the reasons stated.
     8. The Judge at [33] then writes:


             33.  I remind myself that the respondent has made his decision
                  in accordance with the provisions of the  1971  Act.   The
                  appellant has  received  convictions  for  three  offences
                  which have caused serious harm. In addition, relying on my
                  factual findings and the guidance in Andell, I  find  this
                  appellant's offending behaviour which includes allegations
                  of rape and violent offences (even though not resulting in
                  criminal convictions)  has  caused  serious  harm.   As  a
                  result, paragraph 398(c) applies to  him  and  the  public
                  interest requires his deportation unless an  exception  to
                  deportation applies. I consider these below.


     9. The Judge notes there are three children of the family  aged  5,  3
        and 1 whose best interests are to  be  brought  up  by  both  their
        parents in the UK [34].
    10. When considering paragraph 399A, the Judge finds that the appellant
        has been in the UK since 2005 when he entered aged 14. At the  date
        of hearing he was 28.  When considering  whether  very  significant
        obstacles exist to integration the Judge writes:


             38.      The appellant in good health. He  has  experience  of
                  work. He lived in Angola until he was 14 years old and  he
                  will have some understanding of society  and  culture.  He
                  speaks Portuguese and English. He is of  working  age.  He
                  will be able to put his work experience and any skills  he
                  has acquired  in  the  UK  to  good  use  in  Angola.  The
                  combination of his skills may be of value in  Angola,  but
                  he has not made any enquiries about  what  work  might  be
                  available there. He may find securing work difficult,  but
                  it is not an obstacle that he would be unable to overcome.
                  In terms of integrating at a practical level I  find  this
                  is something that may be  disruptive  at  first,  but  the
                  obstacles are not significant. He  is  young  and  has  no
                  health conditions that will prevent him engaging fully  in
                  life there.


             39.  He  has  no  family  life  in  Angola  and  although  the
                  existence of friends and family members would  assist  his
                  integration, their absence does not  mean  that  he  would
                  encounter very significant  obstacles.  There  will  be  a
                  period of adjustment, but he could adjust  to  life  there
                  within a reasonable timescale. His family would be able to
                  support  him  from  the  UK  until  he  is  able  to  find
                  accommodation and work so that he can support himself.


    11. When considering paragraph 399 (b) the Judge  finds  the  appellant
        has a genuine and subsisting relationship with his partner whom  he
        found credible. The Judge at [41] finds  it  would  not  be  unduly
        harsh for the appellant's partner to relocate  to  Angola  for  the
        reasons set out but, in the alternative, it  would  not  be  unduly
        harsh for the partner to  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  if  the
        appellant were removed.
    12. The Judge finds the appellant's removal would not be  unduly  harsh
        upon the children who have support  from  their  mother  and  other
        family members in the UK. The Judge, in the alternative,  finds  it
        would not be unduly harsh for the children to  relocate  to  Angola
        with their mother and father either [49].
    13. The Judge considers whether deportation is  proportionate  pursuant
        to article 8 taking into account section 117 of the 2002  Act.  The
        Judge sets out points in favour of the appellant's removal together
        with points against at [56 - 57] leading to the conclusion at [58]:


             58.  When weighing these factors, I conclude that there are no
                  very  compelling  circumstances  over  and   above   those
                  described    in    the    exceptions.    When    assessing
                  proportionality, I conclude the  decision  to  deport  the
                  appellant on conducive  grounds  strikes  a  fair  balance
                  between the appellant's rights and interests and those  of
                  his  partner  weighed  against  the  wider  interests   of
                  society. It is proportionate to the legitimate end  sought
                  to be achieved, namely the prevention  of  crime  and  the
                  protection of the  public  from  harm.  I  find  that  the
                  Appellant's removal in pursuance of the deportation  order
                  would not be  a  disproportionate  interference  with  his
                  right to respect for his family and private life.


    14. The appellant sought permission to appeal challenging the  decision
        of the Judge to fail to adjourn the proceedings and certain factual
        findings. Permission was granted by another judge of the First-tier
        Tribunal, the operative part of which is in the following terms:


             2.   It is arguable that the Judge has erred  in  law  (a)  by
                  failing  to  adjourn  the  Appellant's  appeal  when   the
                  Appellant's previous agents had applied for legal  aid  in
                  March/April 2019 which had been refused and that they  had
                  recently reapplied for legal aid;  (b)  by  assessing  the
                  Appellants criminality and finding him guilty based on her
                  own evaluation and assessment on  the  wrong  standard  of
                  proof and (c) which assessment  would  arguably  undermine
                  the Judge's findings in relation to the Appellants Article
                  8 rights to a family life with his wife and  children  and
                  the weight given to the public interest.



Error of law


    15. The Judge refers the adjournment request at [11]  of  the  decision
        under challenge where it is written:


             11.      The appellant attended the hearing and asked  for  an
                  adjournment  so   that   he   could   instruct   a   legal
                  representative. I considered the principles of Nwaigwe and
                  decided that it would not be unfair to  the  appellant  to
                  proceed for the following reasons:


                  a) The appellant's former representatives were  no  longer
                     able to represent him at the hearing. He  approached  a
                     new firm in March/April who had applied for  legal  aid
                     funding, but  this  had  been  refused.  The  firm  had
                     resubmitted  the  same  application  but   as   matters
                     currently stand the  appellant  is  unrepresented,  has
                     been refused legal aid and there is no indication  that
                     he will be able to obtain  legal  aid  funding  in  the
                     future.
                  b) The appellant had the benefit of a full set of  bundles
                     that  had  been  prepared  for  him  for  his  original
                     hearing. The only new matters were the  births  of  two
                     children and some updates regarding his employment.  He
                     was able to submit documentary evidence in support  and
                     there was no need to adjourn to require him to  do  so.
                     Ms Godfrey had  indicated  that  she  was  prepared  to
                     accept the  birth  certificate  as  evidence  that  the
                     appellant was the father of the children.
                  c) In terms of his family life the only issue  in  dispute
                     concerned the relationship he had with his partner  and
                     she was present at the hearing and was willing and able
                     to give evidence.
                  d) He was only relying upon two witnesses, his father  and
                     partner. Both witnesses had attended and  had  provided
                     statements.
                  e) He was able to update his statements with hand  written
                     notes and clarify any updates during the hearing.
                  f) He was fit and able to give his own account  about  the
                     alleged criminality referred to  in  the  Nexus  appeal
                     bundles.

    16. The appellant asserts  the  Judge  erred  in  law  as  this  is  an
        important appeal with issues  both  complex  and  comprehensive  in
        detail  meaning  the  appellant  was  in   dire   need   of   legal
        representation. The grounds assert the Judge gave no  reasoning  as
        to why she considered it fair and just for the  appeal  not  to  be
        adjourned to enable the appellant to secure  legal  representation.
        The appellant is not legally qualified and had had the  benefit  of
        legal representation before the First-Tier Tribunal and  the  Upper
        Tribunal when his appeal was originally heard but  remitted  to  be
        reheard. It was argued is was not fair for the Judge to expect  the
        appellant to understand the issues and represent himself.
    17. The claim the Judge failed to give reasons why  it  was  considered
        fair and appropriate not to adjourn the appeal has no merit as this
        is precisely what the Judge did as demonstrated  above.  The  Judge
        considered she was able to obtain best evidence and  to  conduct  a
        hearing in which  the  appellant  was  given  full  opportunity  to
        discuss the evidence and state his case and explain his view of the
        matter to the Judge. It is not  made  out  the  appellant  did  not
        receive a fair hearing.
    18. This was not an appeal in relation to which it had been found legal
        representation was essential as a result of either a complex  point
        of law or disability of the appellant. The fact the  appellant  may
        have had representation previously did  not  automatically  entitle
        him to have the same at the remitted hearing.
    19. It transpired from the discussions before the Upper  Tribunal  that
        the appellant's previous representatives told him they  could  look
        after him no further in November 2018, yet  he  did  not  seek  the
        assistance  of  fresh  representatives   until   March/April   2019
        indicating delay of the appellant's own doing.
    20. The Judge noted a public funding application had been  refused  and
        that the appellant had reapplied but was correct to note there  was
        no indication that the  appellant  will  be  successful  with  that
        application.
    21. Although such issues  are  fact  specific,  in  DMK,  Petition  for
        Judicial Review of a decision by the Secretary  of  State  for  the
        Home  Department  [2012]  CSOH  25  The  Claimant  asked   for   an
        adjournment because he did not have a solicitor.  The judge refused
        as he had had sufficient time to instruct legal representation  and
        his case could be justly determined as all of  his  witnesses  were
        present. The court held that this was not the case of a last-minute
        withdrawal  or  other  failure  by  a  prior  representative.   The
        Claimant had brought his witnesses and did not suggest  that  there
        was other evidence that he needed  time  to  gather.   It  was  not
        unusual for parties to represent  themselves  before  a  specialist
        tribunal.  The provision of appropriate assistance  to  parties  in
        such circumstances was a routine part of the  work  of  a  tribunal
        judge and formed part of their judicial training.  Parties did  not
        have any absolute right to be represented at fast  track  hearings.
        The Judge had exercised her discretion in a proper judicial  manner
        and her ultimate decision was one which was  open  to  her  in  the
        circumstances (para 46).
    22.  In HH (Iran) v SSHD [2008] EWCA  Civ  504  the  judge  refused  to
        adjourn to enable the Appellant to find a representative even where
        the Asylum Support and Resource Team had asked  for  more  time  to
        review the file to decide whether to represent him.  The  Court  of
        Appeal said that it was common enough for Tribunals  to  deal  with
        unrepresented claimants if there was no point of law to be decided.
         Here the simple question was whether the  Appellant  had  given  a
        truthful account and the decision to  refuse  the  application  was
        within the discretion of the judge.   Article 6 of the ECHR was not
        engaged. It was impossible to say  that  legal  representation  was
        indispensable in this case.  The state was not compelled to provide
        the assistance of a lawyer for  every  dispute  involving  a  civil
        point in any event.
    23. In R (on the application of Kigen and Cheruiyot)  [2015]  EWCA  Civ
        1286 it was held that, following the decisions in Denton v TH White
        Ltd [2014] EWCA Civ 906 and R (on the application of Hysaj)  [2014]
        EWCA Civ 1633, the fact that a  litigant  was  awaiting  a  funding
        decision by the Legal Aid Agency was not a complete answer  to  his
        failure to comply with a procedural requirement but  was  simply  a
        factor to be taken into account.  The  position  was  the  same  in
        public law and private civil law proceedings.
    24. The question to be considered by  the  Judge  was  whether  it  was
        possible to have a fair hearing without adjourning the application.
        The finding by the Judge that it was in all  the  circumstances  of
        this appeal was one reasonably open to the Judge  for  the  reasons
        given at [11] of the decision under challenge. No procedural  error
        is made out sufficient to amount to an error of law material to the
        decision to refuse the adjournment request.
    25. In relation to the second ground challenging the  Judge's  findings
        of fact, it is described as "immensely troubling"  that  the  Judge
        had conducted a criminal trial  of  the  appellant  and  found  him
        guilty  of  the  criminal  offence  of  rape,  on  the  balance  of
        probabilities, notwithstanding the alleged victims  non-cooperation
        and the fact the offence was not made out the  criminal  burden  of
        proof at [28] and in relation to the assessment of the  appellant's
        criminality between  [26  -  31].  It  is  said  these  errors  are
        fundamental as they undermined  the  article  8  findings  and  the
        public interest question as part of the balancing exercise.
    26. The assertion the Judge undertook  a  criminal  trial  is  a  claim
        totally without merit. At no point has the Judge  claimed  she  was
        effectively substituting herself for  a  trial  judge  in  criminal
        proceedings. The Judge was entitled, as a matter of law,  take  all
        the evidence  that  had  been  made  available  into  account.  The
        Secretary of State decided that the  appellant's  deportation  from
        the United Kingdom was conducive to the public good. The obligation
        upon the Judge was to consider for herself whether on the facts  as
        found, deportation was conducive to the public good. It was for the
        Judge have regard to  the  evidence  before  the  Tribunal  as  was
        relevant  to  the  question,  to  assess  whether  deportation  was
        conducive to the public good. In this  appeal,  the  evidence  from
        Operation Nexus had been disclosed to the appellant and so  he  was
        fully aware of the material being considered by the Judge.
    27. The appellant fails to provide any authority or reasonable argument
        to support the contention the Judge  was  not  able  to  take  into
        account the "non-conviction" evidence or to find, having considered
        such evidence,  that  it  was  established  on  the  basis  of  the
        appellant's conduct, character and associations  that  his  actions
        had reached such a level  of  seriousness  so  as  to  justify  the
        decision to deport. Bah [2012] UKUT 00196 and RLP (Bah revisited  -
        expeditious justice) [2017] UKUT 330 considered.
    28. The Judge considered this question applying the correct standard of
        proof  to  what  are  civil  proceedings,  namely  the  balance  of
        probabilities. Even  though  the  appellant  might  not  have  been
        convicted to the criminal standard this is not a criminal trial.
    29. So far as the  specific  challenge  to  [28]  of  the  decision  is
        concerned, in that paragraph the Judge writes:


        Rape of female 16 November 2009 CRIS 3038269/9


        28.  No further action was taken in relation to this offence due to
           the victims non-cooperation. I am satisfied on  the  balance  of
           probabilities that the appellant did commit this offence.  These
           are my reasons:


             a) The core elements of  the  victims  account  of  rape  were
                consistent.
             b) I acknowledge she did not appear in a dishevelled state and
                did not appear upset about what she  had  alleged  happened
                [238] however  this  does  not  detract  from  my  findings
                because victims of trauma react in different ways. In  this
                case the victim was a child, she had a  social  worker  and
                officers thought her na�ve for her age and felt he may have
                learning difficulties.
             c) The victim identified the appellant as the perpetrator.
             d) DNA evidence confirmed  he  had  intercourse  with  her.  I
                appreciate he says this was consensual, but this is at odds
                with what she consistently told the police.
             e) She identified the appellant in an ID parade.  He says that
                she gave police the wrong name and that in fact she is  his
                friend, but this is inconsistent with  the  fact  that  she
                identified him in a parade.
             f) The victim did not subsequently cooperate with  the  police
                but she received threatening calls and the police  referred
                to 32  missed  calls  from  a  telephone  number  that  had
                previously left threatening messages.  Although it  is  not
                suggested that the messages were left by the  appellant  it
                seems to me that  the  victim  declined  to  give  evidence
                through fear not, as the  appellant  claimed,  because  she
                realised he was not responsible.
             g)  If she had  realised  that  she  had  made  a  mistake  in
                identifying him as the perpetrator she could have told  the
                police.   She  did  not  do  so.   Further,  the  appellant
                provides no reasonable explanation as to why she chose  him
                as the perpetrator from the ID parade.
             h) The appellant said  he  was  certain  the  victim  was  not
                underage.  However, in the CRIS reports DC Howdle noted the
                victim appeared very na�ve for  the  average  14  year  old
                [241] and this casts significant doubt on  the  appellant's
                claim that he thought she was older.   The  victim  was  in
                fact 16 years of age.
             i) This is an account by a witness describing  the  victim  as
                saying from upstairs "stop, stop, leave  me  alone"  [315].
                This is inconsistent with the appellant's claim that sexual
                intercourse  was  consensual.  A   further   witness,   the
                homeowner, on being barred from  entering  the  bedroom  is
                said to have said, "let this girl get out of my home".
             j) The appellant's explanation as to why the  victim  did  not
                continue with the case is wholly implausible. He  says  the
                victim did not cooperate with the police  as  she  realised
                the police had arrested him and she knew  he  was  not  the
                perpetrator.  When asked why the victim  was  not  here  to
                give evidence on his behalf (the appellant  had  said  they
                were friends) he said he did not know she would be required
                and that he had many supporters on the last occasion. I  do
                not think his response is reasonable.  The  appellant  well
                appreciates the seriousness  of  the  allegations  and  the
                potential consequences. I find the victim did not  come  to
                support him because she is not a friend as he claims.


    30. It was argued on the appellants behalf that the Judge's finding was
        wrong as the  Nexus  documents  did  not  contain  all  the  papers
        available to the CPS and other issues. It  was  submitted  the  CPS
        decided not to prosecute and that the Judge found the appellant had
        committed the rape without his been able to defend the same.
    31. As found above, the  appellant  was  able  to  participate  in  the
        proceedings and was well aware of the documentary  evidence  before
        the Judge in the Nexus bundles. There was no application to  obtain
        any further evidence and the Judge clearly considered the  material
        that had been made available with the required  degree  of  anxious
        scrutiny. Whilst the appellant  may  not  agree  with  the  Judge's
        conclusions or be happy with the finding that he  had  committed  a
        serious offence, albeit assessed to the lower  civil  standard,  it
        has not been made out that finding or those set out between  [26  -
        31] are not within the range of those reasonably open to the  Judge
        on the evidence.
    32. The actual conclusion of the Judge is that at [58] of the  decision
        under challenge  set  out  at  [13]  above.  The  grounds  fail  to
        establish any arguable procedural error or other material error  of
        law by the Judge in concluding the decision  is  proportionate  and
        that  the  appellant's  deportation  from  the  United  Kingdom  is
        conducive to the public good.
