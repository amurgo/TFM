For the Respondent:    Mrs H Masih, instructed by BHB Law


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Secretary of State appeals with permission against  a  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Ferguson, in a determination  promulgated  on
    5th September 2014, to allow  the  appeal  of  Recheal  Wanjiru  Mwaura
    against the Secretary of State's decision  of  20th  December  2013  to
    refuse to vary her leave and  to  remove  her.   In  the  interests  of
    continuity I will refer to Ms Mwaura as "the Appellant", the  title  by
    which she was  described  in  the  proceedings  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

 2. Her application had been based upon her marriage to Jubert Crosdale,  a
    Jamaican citizen with indefinite leave to remain in this country.   The
    evidence given at the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal  was  that
    Mr Crosdale had lived in the United Kingdom since the  age  of  10  and
    that he has both  children  and  grandchildren  in  this  country.   In
    particular as at the date of decision he had two minor children  and  a
    grandson who suffers from autism with whom he had a close relationship.
     The Appellant's application was made whilst she had  extant  leave  to
    remain in this country.

 3. The application was refused by the Secretary of State on the basis that
    Mr Crosdale (who receives employment and support allowance)  could  not
    demonstrate an income of at least ï¿½18,600 per annum.  It was also  said
    that the Appellant had not provided evidence that she  had  passed  the
    required English language test.  The application was said to fail under
    Appendix FM and FM-SE of the Immigration Rules.  The Secretary of State
    went on, in the  refusal  letter,  to  consider  paragraph  EX.1.   The
    Appellant had no parental relationship with children in  this  country.
    With regard to EX.1(b) it was accepted  that  she  had  a  genuine  and
    subsisting relationship with her husband but it was said that  she  had
    not provided any  evidence  to  show  that  there  were  insurmountable
    obstacles to her and her husband continuing family life outside the UK.
     The letter went on to deal with matters under paragraph 276ADE of  the
    Immigration Rules and finally to state that there were  no  exceptional
    circumstances requiring consideration outside the Rules.

 4. At the hearing the judge at first  instance  heard  evidence  from  the
    Appellant and her husband but also from  two  of  her  husband's  adult
    daughters.  He was told of regular contact between the husband and  two
    minor children and of the close  and  supportive  relationship  he  had
    developed with the grandson who suffered from autism.  He was  said  to
    be a person who could control the child, who needed a regular  routine,
    and that the child frequently stayed with him.  The  judge  found  that
    the Appellant had established her English language proficiency  to  the
    necessary level.  He went on to consider paragraph EX.1(b) of paragraph
    FM to the Rules.  It was stated that there was no  dispute  as  to  the
    fact that there was a genuine and subsisting relationship  between  the
    Appellant and her husband.

 5.  Judge Ferguson continued

         "As to whether there are insurmountable obstacles  to  family  life
         continuing outside the United Kingdom this has to be considered  in
         the light of the Court of Appeal's guidance in MF (Nigeria)  [2013]
         EWCA Civ 1192, which rejected at paragraph  49  a  literal  meaning
         that only obstacles which  were  impossible  to  surmount  for  the
         parties to carry on their family life abroad  would  suffice.   The
         proper approach is  to  consider  the  practical  possibilities  of
         relocation (Izuazu  paragraphs  53  to  59  and  Gulshan  paragraph
         24(c)).".

    He then considered what the situation might be if all the children were
    adult but he continued (at paragraph 24) "however the evidence  at  the
    hearing established that  Mr  Crosdale  is  the  father  of  two  minor
    children with whom he has a good relationship  even  though  they  live
    with their mother and have been raised primarily by her.".  He went  on
    to  state  that  it  was  established  that  Mr  Crosdale  had  a  good
    relationship with his  grandson  who  was  diagnosed  with  behavioural
    difficulties which meant that Mr Crosdale in effect acted as a  respite
    career for the child's mother who at times struggled to look after him.
     The evidence established that there  had  been  regular  and  frequent
    contact, often overnight when Mr Crosdale  cared  for  the  child.   At
    paragraph 25 the judge stated "requiring Mr  Crosdale  to  relocate  to
    Kenya with his wife would mean that the frequent care of  his  grandson
    could not continue and it would sever any meaningful relationship  with
    his remaining minor children.".  He then referred to Section 55 of  the
    Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 and found that it was  in
    the best interests of both Mr Crosdale's  minor  children  and  of  the
    grandchild who suffered from autism to continue their relationship with
    him in a direct way.  The judge concluded (at paragraph 26)

         "Those facts mean that when considering the practical possibilities
         of relocation the inability to continue the family  life  currently
         enjoyed between  Mr  Crosdale  and  his  minor  children  and  [the
         grandchild] is a factor of primary importance:  the  disruption  to
         that important aspect of family life  would  be  very  significant.
         Accordingly I conclude that there are insurmountable  obstacles  to
         Ms Mwaura continuing her family life with Mr Crosdale  outside  the
         United Kingdom and the requirements of paragraph EX1 are met".

    The appeal was allowed accordingly.

    In the application for permission to  appeal  the  Secretary  of  State
    argued  that  the   circumstances   described   did   not   amount   to
    "insurmountable obstacles".  Mr Crosdale was not the primary  caregiver
    to any of the children and his relationships with the children could be
    continued by modern communicational means and visits and the support he
    offered to the grandchild could be  provided  by  professional  respite
    services.   The  matter  which  the  judge  had   asserted   as   being
    insurmountable was in reality a question of choice.  The  Secretary  of
    State  argued  that  "insurmountable  obstacles"  constituted   serious
    difficulties  which  the  Appellant  and  Mr  Crosdale  would  face  in
    continuing their family life outside the UK.  Those difficulties  would
    amount to something that could not be overcome even with  a  degree  of
    hardship for one or more of the  individuals  concerned.   It  was  not
    something that was merely unreasonable or undesirable.

 6. At the hearing before me Mrs Masih handed in what was  described  as  a
    Rule 24 response.  I said I would have regard to  that  as  a  skeleton
    argument.  Mr Smart handed up a copy of  the  recent  Court  of  Appeal
    judgment in The Queen on the application of Agyarko and Others  v  SSHD
    [2015] EWCA Civ 440.  He confirmed that there was no challenge  to  the
    genuine nature of the relationship and marriage between  the  Appellant
    and Mr Crosdale and also that at the date  of  decision  20th December
    2013 the relevant version of Appendix FM to the Immigration  Rules  did
    not include EX.2, which was added in July of 2014.  I was not therefore
    concerned with that addition.  Mrs Masih clarified at my  request  that
    as at the date of decision the two minor children of  Mr  Crosdale  had
    been aged 15 and 17.

 7. Mr Smart then addressed me on the substance of  the  appeal.   He  said
    that Agyarko was binding guidance and he referred to paragraphs  21  to
    26.  EX.1 was a stringent test.  He submitted  that  it  had  not  been
    shown that there  were  insurmountable  obstacles  within  the  correct
    meaning of that  term  to  the  couple  continuing  their  relationship
    outside the United  Kingdom.  Mr  Crosland's  contact  with  the  minor
    children and grandchild could be continued  by  other  means  and  that
    would be meaningful.  The Appellant could  go  to  Kenya  and  make  an
    application to join him from abroad and that might only entail a  short
    time.  He submitted that the judge had applied the wrong test  and  had
    given inadequate reasoning for his conclusion.

 8. Mrs Masih for her part submitted that there was no material error.  She
    said the judge had correctly directed himself  as  to  the  meaning  of
    insurmountable obstacles and had  made  an  assessment  of  the  family
    circumstances.  It was not just a matter of the two minor children  but
    also of the grandchild who suffered from autism; the disruption to  his
    care would be significant if Mr Crosland had to leave.  The degree  and
    level of contact both with the minor children and with  the  grandchild
    could not be maintained by "modern means of communication".  There  was
    currently frequent face  to  face  contact,  including  the  grandchild
    staying with Mr Crosland.  The Appellant also helped in  this  respect.
    In the light of Mr Crosdale's  financial  position  the  Appellant  was
    unlikely to obtain entry clearance to return in a short time.   In  her
    submission the judge did sufficient to justify his conclusion.  Agyarko
    could be distinguished as there were no children in that case.

 9. Having heard those submissions I reserved my decision which I now give.
     I have had close regard to the judgment in Agyarko.  At  paragraph  21
    of that judgment Lord Justice Sales stated

         "The phrase 'insurmountable obstacles' as used  in  this  paragraph
         [i.e. paragraph EX.1] of the Rules clearly imposes a high hurdle to
         be overcome by an applicant for leave to remain  under  the  Rules.
         The test is significantly  more  demanding  than  a  mere  test  of
         whether it would be reasonable to expect a couple to continue their
         family life outside the United Kingdom.".

    He continued at paragraph 22

         "... the phrase as used in the Rules is intended to have  the  same
         meaning as in the Strasbourg jurisprudence.  It is clear  that  the
         ECtHR regards it as a formulation  imposing  a  stringent  test  in
         respect of that factor, as is illustrated by Jeunesse v Netherlands
         (see paragraph 117: there were no insurmountable obstacles  to  the
         family settling in Suriname  even  though  the  applicant  and  her
         family would experience hardship if forced to do so)".

    And at paragraph 23

         "For clarity, two points should be made about  the  'insurmountable
         obstacles' criterion.  First,  although  it  involves  a  stringent
         test, it is obviously intended in both the case law and  the  Rules
         to be interpreted in a sensible and practical rather than a  purely
         literal way ...".

    At paragraph 25 he stated

         "The statement made in Mrs Agyarko's letter of application of  26th
         September 2012 that 'she may be separated  from'  her  husband  was
         very weak, and was not supported by any evidence which  might  lead
         to the conclusion that insurmountable  obstacles  existed  to  them
         pursuing their family life together overseas.  There was no witness
         statement from Mr Agyarko or Mr Benette to explain  what  obstacles
         might exist.  The mere fact that Mr Benette is a  British  citizen,
         has lived all his life in the United Kingdom and has a job  here  -
         and hence might  find  it  difficult  and  might  be  reluctant  to
         relocate to Ghana to continue their family life there -  could  not
         constitute insurmountable obstacles to his doing so."

10. The judge at first instance did not of course have the benefit  of  the
    judgment in Agyarko,  which  was  decided  long  after  the  First-tier
    Tribunal hearing, before him.  Nonetheless in my  view  he  did  direct
    himself correctly as to the law at paragraph 22 of  his  decision.   He
    considered the practical elements of the couple relocating  and  indeed
    found that were it not for the impact on the  children  he  would  have
    found against the Appellant.  It was the impact on the  children  which
    made the difference.  He was confronted here with the interface between
    EX.1(b) and Section 55 of the 2009 Act.  Lord Justice Sales in  Agyarko
    made a point of stating that in the cases of  none  of  the  appellants
    were  children  involved.   The  case   of   Ms   Mwaura   is   clearly
    distinguishable on that basis.  It is also notably  different  in  that
    when the couple married and as at the date of application Ms Mwaura had
    extant leave, whereas the appellants in Agyarko  had  overstayed  their
    leave and were in the country unlawfully.  This appeal is not a case of
    deportation of somebody with a criminal record when the public interest
    might well outweigh the interests of children whatever their needs.  Ms
    Mwaura was, as I have said, in the country legally when she married and
    when the application was made and far from being  a  criminal  she  has
    been training to assist as a volunteer in the Probation Service.  In my
    view the judge did not apply the wrong test; the  fact  that  he  found
    that in the absence  of  children  he  would  have  concluded  that  Mr
    Crosdale could be expected to leave  the  country  indicates  that  the
    correct test was applied.  It is the relationship with the children and
    their interests which made the difference.

11. As to reasoning the judge set this out at paragraphs 25 and 26  of  his
    decision.   That  reasoning  is  not  perverse  or  irrational  and  is
    coherent. There were clearly substantial problems  or  difficulties  in
    the couple relocating to Kenya. Whether those difficulties may properly
    be described as  insurmountable  is  a  matter  of  reasoned  judgment.
    Whilst another judge might arguably have reached a different conclusion
    the decision reached, on the evidence, was open to the judge and was in
    my view adequately reasoned.  I accordingly find that no material error
    of law has been established and the decision stands.

Notice of Decision

There was no material error  of  law  in  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
Tribunal.  The decision that the appeal be allowed therefore stands.

No anonymity order was requested and none is made.
