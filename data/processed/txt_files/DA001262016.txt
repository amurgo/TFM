Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr C Avery, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms R Chapman, Counsel instructed by Wilson
Solicitors LLP


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The application for permission to appeal was made by the  Secretary  of
    State but for the purposes of  this  decision  I  shall  refer  to  the
    parties as they were before the First-tier Tribunal, that is Mr MAM  as
    the appellant, and the Secretary of State as the respondent.

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Sierra Leone born on 13th September  1980
    and who was notified on 17th August 2015 that the  Secretary  of  State
    intended to make a deportation order against  him  on  the  grounds  of
    public policy/public security in accordance  with  Regulation  19(3)(b)
    and  Regulation  21  of  the  Immigration  (European   Economic   Area)
    Regulations 2006.  Despite the representations submitted on his behalf,
    the Secretary of State made a decision to make a deportation  order  on
    27th February 2016, refusing his human  rights  claim.   The  appellant
    appealed to the First-tier Tribunal which allowed his  appeal  on  24th
    May 2018.  The Secretary of State was  granted  permission  to  appeal.
    The grounds  of  application  noted  that  the  appellant  had  amassed
    fourteen court appearances for seventeen offences and convictions  over
    a period of 2003 to July 2015.  Amongst those his key convictions were:

      i) A conviction for dealing drugs (cannabis) on the streets  in  2009.
         The appellant received a custodial sentence which  was  reduced  to
         ten months' imprisonment.

     ii) On 25th February 2015 at North London Magistrates' Court possession
         of a controlled drug  (cannabis)  and  obstructing  the  powers  of
         search for drugs, the appellant was fined.

    iii) On 22nd July 2015 at Blackfriars  Crown  Court  the  appellant  was
         convicted of supplying controlled drugs  (cannabis)  and  sentenced
         thereafter to a term of imprisonment of fifteen months.

    The  grounds  of  appeal  queried  whether  the  appellant   had   been
    rehabilitated.  His last offences were committed whilst he was on  bail
    and showed a complete disregard for the law.  He was married to his EEA
    sponsor at the time and as such, she did not prove to have any  control
    over the appellant to prevent him committing offences.  Given the cases
    of R v Bouchereau [1997] EUECJ 30-77 and Kamki [2017] EWCA Civ 1715 and
    given the appellant's offending behaviour, it was  submitted  that  the
    judge had erred in law in the assessment of the  issues  in  the  case.
    Given the public interest in dealing with  drug  dealers,  the  grounds
    were granted permission.

 3. The matter came before the Upper Tribunal  on  27th  July  2018  and  a
    material error of law was found because the First-tier  Tribunal  judge
    had placed considerable reliance on the  appellant's  marriage  to  his
    partner who had not been able to prevent him from continuing to  commit
    offences  and  had  placed  considerable  reliance  on  the   probation
    officer's report dated 4th August 2016 with reference to an  assessment
    on 11th May 2016 finding him to be of low risk of serious harm and  the
    appellant expressed genuine remorse for  his  actions.   The  probation
    officer noted that the appellant had  engaged  with  a  recovery  focus
    programme to address his cannabis use and "while  searching  for  full-
    time employment, Mr  M  undertook  a  weekly  programme  of  activities
    designed to assist him with his job search and in keeping  busy  whilst
    in recovery from cannabis addiction" and further,

         "It is very rare that  I  have  the  opportunity  to  supervise  an
         individual so committed to making a change in their life as  Mr  M:
         he appears someone who is genuinely aware of how his behaviour  has
         impacted on others and completely committed to living his  life  in
         future in a way that reflects his desire to give back  to  society.
         Mr M's level of motivation to implement these changes  is  probably
         one of the highest  I  have  seen  during  my  time  working  as  a
         probation officer".

    That report, however, predated the accepted  cannabis  smoking  of  the
    appellant and was thus based on erroneous information.   The  probation
    officer in a second letter of 24th May 2017 confirmed the  contents  of
    her previous letter, that is 4th August 2016, and that the  appellant's
    attitude had been exemplary.  The judge placed considerable  weight  on
    the report of the probation officer  when  finding  it  to  be  "highly
    supportive of the view that the appellant would not be a present threat
    to society if allowed to remain".

 4. The reliance demonstrated the First-tier Tribunal judge  did  not  take
    into account all relevant factors and failed to  give  adequate  reason
    for reliance on a probation report bearing in mind  the  oral  evidence
    given that the appellant smoked cannabis immediately prior to the birth
    of his child in August 2017.  That decision  was  set  aside,  and  the
    matter resumed before me.

Background

 5. The appellant, now 38 years old, was forcibly abducted and recruited as
    a child soldier aged 12 years in Sierra Leone and exposed  to  violence
    and drug abuse whilst a minor.  He remained as a child soldier until he
    was able to escape at the age of 19 years in 2001.   He  was  diagnosed
    with PTSD two years ago and has relied on drugs (cannabis)  to  relieve
    his problems.  Indeed, the point was made that  he  was  introduced  to
    cannabis whilst a child soldier.  He is now married to an EEA  national
    (she is in fact a dual national and British citizen).

 6. He was first encountered in the United Kingdom in 2002  having  entered
    illegally and claimed asylum which was  refused,  and  his  appeal  was
    dismissed on 19th November  2003.   He  was  initially  detained  under
    immigration powers on 23rd December 2004 but absconded  from  detention
    on 24th December 2004.  He was arrested on 2nd March 2005 on  suspicion
    of immigration offences.

 7. On 4th September 2009 he was considered as a non-EEA national  to  meet
    the criteria for conducive deportation because  he  had  been  given  a
    sentence on 1st August 2007 at  Hull  Crown  Court  for  drugs  related
    offences where he was sentenced to six months'  imprisonment,  and  for
    his conviction on  6th  April  2009  at  Blackfriars  Crown  Court  for
    possessing controlled class C drugs with intent to supply  and  he  was
    sentenced  to  30  months'  imprisonment.   This  was  reduced  on  3rd
    September  2009  on  appeal  to  ten  months'  imprisonment.   It   was
    considered  that  he  had  an  aggregated  total  of  sixteen   months'
    imprisonment and he was issued with a decision to  make  a  deportation
    order on 4th September 2009.  That decision was withdrawn following  an
    EEA application in the light of his subsisting  relationship  with  his
    partner and he was sent a warning letter  to  inform  him  that  if  he
    reoffended he would remain liable for deportation.  Following  judicial
    review proceedings on 6th  August  2013  he  was  issued  with  an  EEA
    residence card as a family member of an EEA national.

 8. He was then convicted on 22nd July 2015 at Blackfriars Crown Court  for
    supplying a class B controlled drug (cannabis) and  sentenced  on  24th
    July  2015  to  fifteen  months'  imprisonment.   There  followed   the
    Secretary of State's decision to  make  a  deportation  order  on  27th
    February 2016

 9. The full  criminal  history  of  the  appellant  was  set  out  in  the
    immigration decision of the Secretary of State

    The Hearing

10. At the resumed hearing before me  the  appellant  adopted  his  witness
    statements, the latest being  2nd  June  2019  and  confirmed  that  he
    continued living with his partner and their relationship was good.   He
    worked  part-time  and  was  effectively  the  primary  carer  for  his
    daughter, taking her to playgroup or  nursery  school  from  Monday  to
    Thursdays and working at the weekends.  He accepted that he had a  long
    list of convictions although he maintained that the  latest  conviction
    in 2015, he had not been intending to supply drugs.  He  accepted  that
    he had another child but in her own interests he had decided to  desist
    from contact.

11. The appellant did state that he regretted what went wrong and going  to
    prison.  Although he considered the last time he committed  a  criminal
    offence was in 2007 he did accept that he smoked cannabis two to  three
    months before his younger daughter was born but resisted the suggestion
    that he would go back to smoking cannabis because he  needed  to  spend
    the money on his daughter who was now  19  months  old.   It  was  this
    rather than the conviction which had persuaded him to give up.  He  was
    however now having counselling every two weeks.  He accepted  that  his
    partner's view of his offending was that it was  very  disturbing,  and
    she was distressed.  He was  adamant  that  he  did  not  use  cannabis
    anymore.

12. Under re-examination he confirmed he would like to resume contact  with
    his older daughter, but he did not quite know how to go about it as  he
    did not have solicitors in the Family Court.  He  associated  offending
    with the police and being handcuffed and sent  to  prison.   The  first
    time he got post-traumatic stress disorder support was when he went and
    had moved to Treforest.

13. The appellant's wife attended and gave oral testimony.   She  confirmed
    that having received a no-fault eviction notice she had decided to  buy
    the couple a home where they could live together  with  their  daughter
    and there was more space and away from London.  She was  engaged  in  a
    legal training contract which would end in September  2020.   They  had
    met in London where things had not gone well for her  husband  and  she
    thought that they could start again in Wales.  She confirmed he was the
    primary carer for their daughter and she would not  know  how  to  cope
    without him.  He had ceased contact with his  older  daughter,  in  her
    interests, but he did not have legal aid and she confirmed  that  there
    were no concerns in relation to the care that he had of  his  daughter.
    As it was more damaging to carry on  the  contact  in  the  acrimonious
    family law proceedings, he had decided to cease contact.

14. She thought there had been "massive changes" in their lives.  They were
    living in a completely different place and her husband  was  away  from
    the previous influences that had got him into trouble.   Previously  he
    had been able to get a job and had returned to London which was a  poor
    idea.  Previously there had been much instability in their  lives,  but
    they were now settled.

15. Under cross-examination she accepted that the appellant had  previously
    had a job in London and that he had a  long  criminal  record  but  she
    asserted that there was a long period when he did not  offend  and  his
    last offence was a huge mistake but he was in a  very  different  place
    now particularly being a primary carer of their daughter with a  stable
    job and a stable  home.   He  had  engaged  in  treatment  and  learned
    techniques to help him.

16. She confirmed that  she  was  entirely  comfortable  with  her  husband
    looking after their child, she would  never  leave  the  child  in  the
    custody of someone that she did not  trust  except,  for  example,  her
    husband and her mother.  She confirmed that the effect on her  daughter
    of her husband's removal would be devastating.  She was concerned  that
    her husband would commit suicide if he was removed, and the  effect  on
    her daughter would be enormous.

17. The  appellant's  mother-in-law  Mrs  CMDG  attended  and  adopted  her
    statement and gave oral testimony.   She  confirmed  that  he  was  the
    primary carer.  She herself  lived  and  worked  in  Devon  as  a  film
    programmer and in the box office  of  an  art  centre.   The  emotional
    impact on her daughter and granddaughter would be desperate.

18. Both Mr Avery and Ms Chapman made submissions which I have  taken  into
    account and I refer to in my conclusions.  In  particular,  Ms  Chapman
    referred to  the  report  of  Lisa  Davies,  Chartered  and  Registered
    Forensic Psychologist of Expert Psychological Services  Ltd  dated  3rd
    June 2019 which was admitted under Rule 15(2)(a) of the Upper  Tribunal
    Procedure Rules.

Analysis

19. The principles governing the deportation of EEA  nationals  are  to  be
    found at Regulation 21 of  the  Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)
    Regulations 2006 which provide:

         "21. (1) In this regulation a  'relevant  decision'  means  an  EEA
             decision  taken  on  the  grounds  of  public  policy,  public
             security or public health.

             (2)  A relevant decision may not be taken  to  serve  economic
             ends.

             (3)  A relevant decision may not be  taken  in  respect  of  a
             person with a permanent right of residence under regulation 15
             except on serious grounds of public policy or public security.



             (4)  A relevant decision may not be taken except on imperative
             grounds of public security in respect of an EEA national who-

                  (a)  has resided in the United Kingdom  for  a  continuous
                  period of  at  least  ten  years  prior  to  the  relevant
                  decision; or

                  (b)  is under the age of 18, unless the relevant  decision
                  is necessary in his best interests, as provided for in the
                  Convention on the Rights  of  the  Child  adopted  by  the
                  General Assembly of the United Nations  on  20th  November
                  1989.

             (5)  Where a relevant decision is taken on grounds  of  public
             policy or public security it shall, in addition  to  complying
             with the preceding paragraphs of this regulation, be taken  in
             accordance with the following principles-

                  (a)  the  decision  must  comply  with  the  principle  of
                  proportionality;

                  (b)   the  decision  must  be  based  exclusively  on  the
                  personal conduct of the person concerned;

                  (c)  the personal conduct of  the  person  concerned  must
                  represent a  genuine,  present  and  sufficiently  serious
                  threat affecting  one  of  the  fundamental  interests  of
                  society;

                  (d)  matters isolated from the particulars of the case  or
                  which relate to considerations of  general  prevention  do
                  not justify the decision;

                  (e)  a person's previous criminal convictions  do  not  in
                  themselves justify the decision.

             (6)  Before taking a  relevant  decision  on  the  grounds  of
             public policy or public security in relation to a  person  who
             is resident in the United Kingdom the decision maker must take
             account of considerations such as the age,  state  of  health,
             family and economic situation  of  the  person,  the  person's
             length of residence in the United Kingdom, the person's social
             and cultural integration  into  the  United  Kingdom  and  the
             extent of the person's links with his country of origin".

20. From the above it is clear that the tests in regulation  21(3)  and  in
    regulation 21(5) both have to be satisfied in his case if the Secretary
    of State's deportation decision is to be upheld and see Kamki.

21. The person concerned must also be a present threat,  Orphanopoulos  and
    Oliveri v Verwaltungsgericht Stuttgart, [2004] ECR  1999  and  previous
    convictions are relevant:

         "Only  insofar  as  the  circumstances  which  gave  rise  to  that
         conviction are evidence of personal conduct constituting a  present
         threat to the requirements of public policy".

    It is also relevant to note that in the Secretary of State for the Home
    Department and Straszewski  [2015]  EWCA  Civ  1245  Moore-Bick  LJ  at
    paragraph 13 confirmed  that  exceptions  to  the  permanent  right  of
    residence based on public policy are construed restrictively  and  that
    public revulsion is not generally relevant to decisions to deport under
    EU law.

22. At paragraph 31 of the decision to make  a  deportation  order  it  was
    specifically accepted by the Secretary of State that the appellant  had
    the "middle level of protection" whereby his deportation needed  to  be
    justified on serious grounds of public policy or public security and as
    set out above.

23. At the hearing, to my mind correctly, Ms Chapman relied on,  (albeit  a
    Scottish case), Goralczyk [2018] CSIH 60 at paragraph 22:

         "22. Moore-Bick LJ's expectation that  there  should  be  stringent
             restrictions on a Member State's  ability  to  remove  an  EEA
             national, including a 'foreign criminal', who has acquired the
             right to reside in the United Kingdom  is  borne  out  by  the
             terms of the 2006 Regulations.  In particular, a  decision  to
             deport an EEA national with a permanent right of residence may
             not be taken except on serious grounds  of  public  policy  or
             public security: regulation 21(3).  Regard has to  be  had  to
             the word 'serious', a point made by Mr Caskie when  explaining
             the effect of the 2006 Regulations as being to establish three
             levels of rights and consequent degrees of protection  against
             removal.  A decision to remove a person who has resided in the
             United Kingdom for less than  five  years  may  be  taken  'on
             grounds of public policy' but a decision to  remove  a  person
             who has resided in the United Kingdom for more than five years
             cannot be taken 'except on serious grounds of public  policy'.
             It follows that 'serious grounds' of public policy  must  mean
             something different from "grounds" of public  policy,  and  it
             follows from that that the decision-maker must  identify  just
             what the relevant grounds are and then  evaluate  them  as  to
             their seriousness.  Moreover,  a  relevant  decision  must  be
             taken in accordance with the principles set out in  regulation
             21(5).  Finally, in terms of regulation 21(6),  before  taking
             such a decision the  decision-maker  must  take  into  account
             considerations such as the age, state of  health,  family  and
             economic situation of the person, his length of  residence  in
             the United Kingdom and  the  extent  of  his  links  with  his
             country of origin".

24. It is also relevant to underline that the  burden  of  proving  that  a
    person represents a genuine, present and  sufficiently  serious  threat
    affecting one of the fundamental interests of society under  Regulation
    21(5)(c) of the EEA Regulations rests with the Secretary of  State  and
    that the standard of proof is the balance of probabilities, Arranz (EEA
    Regulations- deportation -test) [2017] UKUT 00294.

25. Even if the conduct represents a genuine and present  and  sufficiently
    serious threat affecting one of the fundamental interests  of  society,
    before taking a relevant decision the decision-maker must go on to take
    into account the considerations such  as  the  age,  state  of  health,
    family and the economic situation of the person, the person's length of
    residence in the UK, and their social and cultural integration  in  the
    UK, and the extent of their links with the country of origin.   In  all
    cases it is necessary  to  consider  whether  it  is  proportionate  to
    proceed with removal in all the circumstances, and whether  it  is  the
    least onerous method of achieving a legitimate aim.  As  held  in  Essa
    (EEA: rehabilitation/integration) [2013]  UKUT  316,  deportation  must
    represent a present threat by reason of propensity to  reoffend  or  an
    unacceptably high risk of reoffending.  The mere  fact  of  a  criminal
    conviction is not enough and with regards rehabilitation:

         "34. If the very factors that contribute to  his  integration  that
             assist in rehabilitation of such offenders  (family  ties  and
             responsibilities,    accommodation,    education,    training,
             employment, active membership of a  community  and  the  like)
             will assist in the completion of a process of  rehabilitation,
             then that can be a substantial factor in the balance.  If  the
             claimant   cannot   constitute   a   present    threat    when
             rehabilitated, and is well-advanced  in  rehabilitation  in  a
             host state where there is a substantial degree of integration,
             it may well  very  well  be  disproportionate  to  proceed  to
             deportation".

    Specifically, the Tribunal must  consider  the  relative  prospects  of
    rehabilitation, that  is  ceasing  to  commit  crime  when  considering
    whether an offender should be deported, Secretary of State for the Home
    Department v Dumliauskas & Ors [2015] EWCA Civ 145.

26. In MC (Essa principles recast)  Portugal  [2015]  UKUT  520  the  Upper
    Tribunal provided the following guidance:

         "8.   Gauging  such  prospects  requires  assessing  the   relative
             prospects of  rehabilitation  in  the  host  Member  State  as
             compared with those in the Member State of origin, but, in the
             absence of evidence, it is not to be  assumed  that  prospects
             are  materially  different  in   that   other   Member   State
             (Dumliauskas [46], [52]-[53] and [59]).

         9.   Matters that are relevant when examining the prospects of  the
             rehabilitation  of   offenders   include   family   ties   and
             responsibilities,    accommodation,    education,    training,
             employment, active membership of  a  community  and  the  like
             (Essa (2013) at [34]).  However, lack of access to a Probation
             Officer or equivalent in the other Member State should not, in
             general, preclude deportation (Dumliauskas [55]).

         10.  In the  absence  of  integration  and  a  right  of  permanent
             residence, the future prospects of  integration  cannot  be  a
             weighty factor (Dumliauskas [44] and [54]).   Even  when  such
             prospects have significant weight they are not a  trump  card,
             as what the Directive and the 2006 EEA Regulations require  is
             a wide-ranging holistic assessment.  Both recognise  that  the
             more serious the risk of reoffending, and the offences that  a
             person may commit, the greater the right to interfere with the
             right of residence (Dumliauskas at [46] and [54])".

27. Mr Avery submitted that I should maintain the deportation  order.   The
    appellant's wife had not prevented  him  from  offending,  and  he  had
    previously worked whilst offending.  Mr Avery referred to his extensive
    list of criminal convictions. I address these points  in  my  reasoning
    below.

28. The appellant having been recruited in  Sierra  Leone,  remained  as  a
    child soldier until he was able to escape in 2001.  He arrived  in  the
    United Kingdom in 2001 and clearly there is evidence that he  was  here
    in 2002 and has thus been in the United Kingdom since that  time  which
    is approximately 17 years.  Despite his appeal being dismissed  it  was
    accepted at the hearing before the Immigration Tribunal in 2002 that he
    had indeed been forcibly recruited as a  child  soldier  but  owing  to
    peace building activities he would no longer be at risk on  return.  He
    asserts that he was witness to atrocities during his time in  effective
    captivity and there is no reason to disbelieve this.

29. Ms Chapman referred to the report of Ms Davies, the Consultant Forensic
    Psychologist, dated 3rd June 2019, and the report of  Professor  Katona
    dated 17th February  2016  who  confirmed  that  the  appellant  had  a
    diagnosis  of  post-traumatic  stress   disorder.    Professor   Katona
    confirmed at paragraph 7.3 and 7.4 of his report the following:

         "7.3 In my opinion Mr M's PTSD has been  caused  by  the  traumatic
             experiences he had suffered in Sierra Leone while forced to be
             a child soldier.  PTSD is almost invariable  in  former  child
             soldiers (Derluyn et al 2004).

         7.4  These experiences have had a lasting impact on his psyche.  He
             has a range of psychologically disturbing problems  which  are
             significantly compromising his social functional ability.  His
             intrusive thoughts, his nightmares,  and  his  flashbacks  are
             particular indicators of psychological trauma and are unlikely
             to occur in the absence of such trauma".

    He also diagnosed the appellant  in  2016  as  having  a  cannabis  use
    disorder and that the  appellant  would  experience  forced  return  to
    Sierra Leone as forced  re-traumatisation  and  an  increased  risk  of
    suicide in people with PTSD.  It was concluded that there  was  a  high
    risk he would attempt suicide with potentially fatal consequences if he
    lost hope of being allowed to remain in the UK with his wife who is his
    main source of emotional strength.  That was prior to the birth of  his
    younger daughter. Professor Katona recommended effective  treatment  of
    PTSD and associated depressive symptoms  which  included  psychological
    treatment.

30. I thus accepted that the appellant presented, as Ms Chapman  urged  the
    court to do so, as a vulnerable witness particularly  when  giving  his
    evidence before the court.  Mr Avery made comment on the appellant  not
    understanding  the  seriousness  of  his  offending  and   lacking   in
    acceptance of his offending but the appellant's presentation  in  court
    can conceivably have been affected by his PTSD and I note the report of
    Ms Davies below which did register the appellant's genuine remorse.

31. Is he a present threat and are there serious grounds to deport him?  In
    relation to the offences the appellant  has  numerous  convictions  but
    almost entirely relating to the use and supply  of  cannabis,  although
    that is not to indicate an underestimation of the  use  and  supply  of
    drugs.  Most of the convictions  date  from  prior  to  2009  with  two
    further  convictions,  one  on  25th  February  2015  at  North  London
    Magistrates Court where he  was  convicted  of  obstructing  powers  of
    search and possession of cannabis for which he was fined, and a  second
    conviction on 22nd July 2015 at Blackfriars Crown Court  where  he  was
    convicted, more seriously,  of  the  index  offence  and  sentenced  to
    fifteen months' imprisonment.  The  appellant  did  not  appeal  either
    conviction or sentence.  It is noted that the cannabis related  offence
    was committed in 2014, some five years ago.  I do  take  note  that  at
    paragraph 7.7 in his report Professor Katona  describes  the  appellant
    being forced to use cannabis when he was recruited as a  child  soldier
    and his offending is related to that drug use.

32. His former probation officer Ms Emily Fry wrote in a letter dated  24th
    May 2017 that the appellant's attitude  was  exemplary  throughout  his
    supervision on licence and that he demonstrated a determination to make
    a new positive future for himself.  She described him previously on 4th
    August 2016 as being assessed as a low risk of serious  harm.   In  the
    error of law decision, I made a criticism of those two reports from the
    probation officer on the basis that the author did  not  appear  to  be
    aware that the appellant had once again indulged in cannabis smoking.

33. I specifically asked Mr Avery at the hearing before  me  whether  there
    was any reliance placed on the Bouchereau point such that a  threat  to
    public policy can exist even where there is no propensity on  the  part
    of the appellant to reoffend.  Protecting society from crimes  such  as
    those that the appellant has committed, that is the  supply  of  drugs,
    are clearly of a fundamental interest to society given that the  nature
    of the offence involves drugs.  I acknowledge that even a  slight  risk
    of the appellant reoffending could constitute a genuine and present and
    sufficiently serious threat to one  of  the  fundamental  interests  to
    society.  However, Mr Avery resiled from  any  reliance  on  Bouchereau
    considering that the  offence  was  perhaps  not  serious  enough,  and
    although the appellant has on his  own  evidence  had  three  terms  of
    custody for supplying drugs in the form of  cannabis  the  question  is
    whether he presents a sufficiently serious threat affecting one of  the
    fundamental interests of society and  there  are  serious  grounds  for
    removing him.

34. I note from the OASys assessment which was printed  on  25th  September
    2018 that the date on which the assessment was completed  was  on  12th
    May 2016.  At that point it was noted that the purpose of the  sentence
    was punishment rather than reduction of  crime  or  public  protection.
    The report made no reference to any form of violent offence  and  again
    recorded his very traumatic childhood experiences  for  which  he  used
    cannabis.  His drug use, linked to his  offending,  was  restricted  to
    cannabis.   The  report  also  recorded  two   attempts   at   suicide.
    Specifically his risk of reoffending at that time was classified as low
    although the OGRS3 probability of proving reoffending over a  two  year
    period was given a medium category.  Medium risk of  offending  is  not
    minimal.  It  has,  however,  now  been  five  years  since  his   last
    conviction. The OASys assessment recorded that he was very motivated to
    address his offending, understood his offending and he was very capable
    of having the  capacity  to  change  and  reduce  his  offending.   The
    positive factors maintained he had a supportive relationship and stable
    accommodation.

35. The OASys report analysed in detail  whether  there  was  any  risk  of
    serious harm to others (that is the public) and based  on  the  overall
    information in the report, it was identified that the appellant had not
    been convicted of any of the categories of offence listed  as  violent,
    sexual, possession of weapons, robbery or 'any other offence  which  is
    as serious'. The report identified that none of the further  categories
    of risk relating to significant events on page 30 of the  OASys  report
    applied. In the risk of serious harm screening his risk was  classified
    as a risk of reoffending as low and the 'Layer 3' risk of serious  harm
    screening noted under the question 'is there anything  else  about  the
    offender that leads you to consider that  a  full  analysis  should  be
    completed?' the answer was 'no'. Under the  conclusion  'likelihood  of
    serious harm to others':  'The  full  risk  of  serious  harm  analysis
    indicates the following risk' was followed by the  insertion  'no  data
    found'.  That, I stress, relates to serious harm rather than no harm.

36. When assessing the risk of re-offending, I also take into  account  the
    evidence of the appellant's wife who following working  as  a  casework
    manager at the Independent Office  for  Police  Conduct  (formerly  the
    Independent Police Complaints Commission),  started  a  legal  training
    contract on 1st October 2018. I accept the credibility of her  evidence
    owing to the responsible positions she has held and the consistency and
    cogency of her oral evidence.

37. She confirmed that her husband is now under the care of  the  community
    mental health team with  increased  help  from  a  psychiatrist  and  a
    community psychiatric nurse.  This followed a mental health  crisis  in
    the second week of September 2018.  She gave evidence that he is now  a
    hardworking family man and does not  pose  a  threat  to  anyone.   She
    confirmed that he spent most of his time now either looking after their
    child or working.

38. I also found the  evidence  of  the  appellant's  mother-in-law  to  be
    entirely credible.  She explained the devotion of the appellant to  his
    wife and daughter, for whom he is the primary carer.  The witness  also
    has a responsible position in employment,  are  clearly  aware  of  the
    appellant's  past.   Both  were  determined  that  the  appellant   has
    reformed.

39. I turn to the independent psychological risk assessment report of  Lisa
    Davies dated 24th April 2019 and I give weight to  that  report.   Lisa
    Davies  is  a  well-qualified  and  experienced   Consultant   Forensic
    Psychiatrist and Director of Expert Psychological Services.  She  works
    in private practice and until July 2012 was contracted to work  at  the
    Dene  Hospital  medium  secure  unit  and   low   secure   and   locked
    rehabilitation services.  She has previously worked in high security at
    both  Broadmoor  and  Rampton  high   secure   psychiatrist   hospitals
    undertaking research into the placement needs of men and women detained
    in high secure hospitals.  She was also the  Acting  Treatment  Manager
    for the  cognitive  self-change  programme  at  HMP  Kingston  and  has
    knowledge and experience of assessing suitability  for  the  accredited
    offending behaviour programmes currently run in HM Prison Service.  For
    these reasons, I found her report important, current and persuasive.

40. At 3.2.27 of her report Ms Davies stated that the  appellant  described
    intrusive symptoms of PTSD when seen by Professor Katona in custody and
    admitted to using cannabis to assist him  with  relief  from  his  PTSD
    symptoms.  He was referred to a counsellor and recommended to start CBT
    intervention for complex PTSD.  He was  also  referred  to  a  cannabis
    users support workshop.  She also recorded at 3.2.28 that the appellant
    received no adjudications during his time  in  custody  and  of  having
    fully engaged with all supervision activities  and  appeared  open  and
    reflective with regards to his offending behaviour and the harm  caused
    to  the  community.   She  also  recorded  that  his  dynamic  risk  of
    reoffending was assessed as low.

41. She recorded that the appellant commenced counselling in 2016  and  now
    sees a counsellor regularly to talk  about  his  experience  of  drugs,
    trauma and offending.

42. Of particular importance at 3.2.31 she recorded the appellant

         "spoke positively of his engagement  in  counselling  and  reported
         that it has been helpful to him in understanding his experiences as
         a child soldier and his  response  to  those  experiences.   He  is
         awaiting an appointment with a psychiatrist and reported that he is
         keen to engage in further treatment  when  available  to  him.   He
         expressed pride in his ability to achieve abstinence from  cannabis
         whilst still experiencing a pronounced level of PTSD symptoms".

43. Ms Davies reviewed the appellant's forensic history and confirmed  that
    he had ceased to use cannabis since June 2017.   He  reported  that  he
    would never become involved in the supply of drugs in  the  future  and
    had ceased all contact with  individuals  involved  in  the  supply  of
    drugs.  He reported that he is committed to recovery and  feels  better
    in himself having stopped using cannabis (3.3.10).

44. Ms Davies confirmed that the  appellant  now  keeps  himself  busy  and
    distracts himself with cleaning and chores and he has managed  to  cope
    with his PTSD symptoms without using cannabis (3.4.3).

45. At 3.4.6 the report confirmed that

         "Mr  M  is  not  currently  subject  to  licence   conditions   and
         supervision by the National Probation Service as  this  expired  on
         21st October 2016.  He is reported to have  successfully  completed
         his licence period".

    He identified his plans to include "looking after  my  family,  keeping
    working and live a normal life" (3.4.8).

46. At 5.0.8 Ms Davies reported that she would "concur with assessments  of
    his risk of future violence falling in the low range", and at 5.0.9

         "the OASys reconviction scores were now out of date due to the time
         that has passed since they were calculated".

47. I accept that the OASys report itself  may  be  dated  (2016),  but  it
    maintains relevance in terms of the serious harm that could  be  caused
    by his offending, and those indicators I have discussed above and taken
    into account.

48. In particular,  Ms  Davies  confirmed  at  paragraph  6.3  that  having
    considered his offending  behaviours  on  the  Level  of  Service  Case
    Management Inventory as current risk falling in the low range.  He  was
    considered to be at increased risk of reoffending in  the  event  of  a
    deterioration in his mental health and a return to  cannabis  use  when
    experiencing difficulties  securing  employment.   However,  protective
    factors to be maintained included his support of relationship with  his
    wife, the stability of his accommodation and his  willingness  to  work
    and engage with agencies.

49. Ms Davies set out at paragraph  7.2.3  a  list  or  protective  factors
    relating to  work,  financial  management,  motivation  for  treatment,
    attitudes towards authority, life goals and medication,  all  of  which
    were  present.   The  only  one  absent  was  leisure  activities.   At
    paragraph 7.3.1 external  factors  included  social  network,  intimate
    relationship, living circumstances which were present.   I  noted  that
    professional care was identified as absent but Ms Chapman  referred  to
    this as being in relation to the Probation Service.

50. In particular, Ms Davies confirmed that the appellant

         "reports no current debts or financial concerns, there is no recent
         evidence of financial irresponsibility.  He is engaged  in  regular
         and  stable  employment  and  reports  intention  to  maintain  his
         employment.   He  has  distanced   himself   from   criminal   peer
         associations and abstained from illicit drug use since June  2017".
         (8.4 of the report).

51. She added at 8.5 that the  appellant  does  not  express  current  pro-
    criminal attitudes and beliefs and expresses appropriate regret for his
    offences and acknowledgment of the harm caused.

52. I acknowledge Mr Avery observed  that  during  his  oral  evidence  the
    appellant appeared not to accept that smoking cannabis was  an  offence
    but bearing in mind the report of Lisa  Davies  at  section  9,  I  can
    accept that the experience of giving evidence at court was  possibly  a
    stressful experience for him and have considered his oral evidence with
    that in mind.

53. In conclusion at 10.3 and 10.4 Ms Davies had this to say:

         "10.3     Assessment  undertaken  in  preparation  of  this  report
                indicates that Mr.  M  currently  presents  a  low  risk  of
                reoffending.  He has expressed remorse for his engagement in
                acts of harm towards others and there is limited evidence to
                support the presence of  antisocial  attitudes  and  beliefs
                that drove his repeated use of cannabis.  He accepts that he
                has been involved in the use of cannabis and the  supply  of
                cannabis to others.  He denies ever being directly  involved
                in the sale of drugs  for  financial  gain.   He  admits  to
                giving other individuals drugs from  his  own  personal  use
                supply in  exchange  for  money.   He  admits  that  he  has
                purchased cannabis and also  been  provided  with  cannabis,
                accommodation and food in exchange for  his  involvement  in
                [indirect] drug supply.  He was at the time of his offending
                vulnerable by virtue of his past  trauma,  had  active  PTSD
                that  he  was  self-medicating   with   cannabis   and   was
                particularly vulnerable to exploitation by others.

         10.4 With respect to his risk of  reoffending  and  risk  of  harm,
                having reviewed the evidence contained within the  documents
                available and my own clinical assessment of  Mr.  M  on  8th
                April 2019, in my psychological opinion,  it  is  considered
                that Mr. M presents with a low level  of  risk  for  general
                (non-violent) offending.  He presents with  a  low  risk  of
                causing  serious  harm  at  the  current  time.   Protective
                factors are present for Mr. M that could reduce the risk  of
                him committing further offences and assist him  to  maintain
                long  term  desistance  from  any  further  involvement   in
                offences.  Maintenance of supportive relationships with  his
                wife, access to  specialist  trauma  focused  therapies  and
                engagement in employment are considered important protective
                factors for Mr. M.  There is a moderate  to  high  level  of
                protection available at the current time.   I  am  fully  in
                support of Mr. M being granted the right to  remain  in  the
                UK, where he can access specialist trauma focused  treatment
                to assist  him  in  his  long-term  recovery  from  cannabis
                dependence and PTSD.  I do not consider that the  public  in
                the UK would be exposed to an unacceptable level of harm  in
                the event of Mr. M being allowed to remain in the UK".

54. I found the report of Ms Davies well-reasoned and detailed and  I  give
    it weight.

55. Goralczyk held that the serious grounds must be made out  and  although
    drug supply on the streets of London is a  serious  matter,  I  am  not
    persuaded, in the light of his  current  presentation  that  there  are
    present and serious grounds on which to deport the appellant.   I  have
    factored in the various reports, including those cited and  note  Kamki
    which identified that even where the risk is low it is still legitimate
    for the Tribunal to find a sufficiently serious threat.   Kamki,  which
    involved deportation for a sexual offence (rape), clearly identified at
    paragraph 35 that the potential level of harm identified in  the  OASys
    report caused by the appellant's reoffending was relevant noting

             'In the context of analysing the OASys report the  meaning  of
             the FTT is clear: the offender manager's view as  set  out  in
             the report was in line with that of the judge, namely that the
             probability  of  the  appellant  re-offending  is  low   ("the
             appellant is at low risk of offending"), but was also that the
             overall risk in relation to the commission of similar offences
             against vulnerable  young  females  was  high  ("the  risk  in
             relation to committing similar offences [etc]"), in the  sense
             of taking the probability of re-offending in combination  with
             the serious harmful effects if it occurred. The FTT judge uses
             different language to reflect  the  two  different  senses  of
             "risk";

56. I have carefully considered the appellant's previous offending which  I
    have set out in detail but in view of the evidence provided overall,  I
    do not accept therefore that it has been shown that the appellant poses
    a genuine, present and serious threat such as the threshold of  serious
    grounds of public policy or public security justifying his  deportation
    are made out.

57. Even if that were not the case, when  approaching  the  proportionality
    assessment, I also take into account the considerations of his age  and
    his health.  I take into account his background which I  have  outlined
    and the fact that he has lived here for over 17 years  and  now  has  a
    settled family life in their home bought in June 2017.  Throughout  the
    reports there were references to his increased vulnerability to suicide
    should he be returned to Sierra Leone where he has not lived  for  many
    years and then under traumatic circumstances.  His  attachment  to  his
    family is evident.  A significant alteration in his life  will  be  the
    advent of his second child in  August  2017.   I  accept  that  he  has
    another child who was  born  in  2006/2007  but  as  explained  by  the
    appellant and his wife, he has been unable to see her for her own  good
    for the last seven years, which in itself must have been  problematical
    for the appellant.  I accept the appellant's wife's evidence  that  the
    rupture in his relationship with his daughter was not the fault of  the
    appellant's and done in order to assist the child.

58. The appellant has a clear attachment with his second daughter, and  for
    whom he is the primary carer. I accept the evidence that he  takes  the
    child to nursery school and dovetails his work  with  that  child.   He
    spends much of his time with her and is the main source  of  child-care
    while  his  wife  is  working.  The  mother  in  law  can   only   help
    intermittently as she herself is working.  The  care  afforded  by  the
    appellant to his child was confirmed by the  appellant's  wife  who  is
    full time in her legal training contract.  I accept that the child  has
    a dependence on the appellant.

59. Article 24(3) of the Charter of  Fundamental  Rights  of  the  European
    Union provides:

         "Every child shall have the right to maintain on a regular basis  a
         personal relationship and direct  contact  with  both  his  or  her
         parents, unless this is contrary to his or her interests".

60. The best interests of the child  as  set  out  by  Section  55  of  the
    Borders,  Citizenship  and  Immigration  Act  2009  require  the   best
    interests of the child to be considered not necessarily as a trump card
    but as a primary  consideration.   I  accept  that  the  appellant  has
    weakened his social  and  cultural  integrative  links  in  the  United
    Kingdom owing to his offending and imprisonment, but the child was born
    subsequent to his last conviction  and  appears  to  be  a  significant
    motivation in his life.  It is axiomatic that the sins  of  the  parent
    should not be visited on the child.

61. I accept that the appellant's wife was previously unable to prevent his
    re-offending, but it is clear from the reports  that  his  relationship
    with her is a very supportive, and significant factor in his  emotional
    wellbeing and she and he together  provide  a  stable  home  for  their
    child.   It is in the child's best interests to remain in a stable home
    together with both parents and at her age to remain  with  her  primary
    carer.

62. I accept owing to the lapse of time since he has been  there  that  the
    appellant has minimal links with Sierra Leone and his family life would
    be completely severed should he be forced to return to Sierra Leone.

63. It is also the case that although there was no evidence before me as to
    the likelihood of rehabilitation in  Sierra  Leone  that  it  would  be
    significantly  more  difficult  to  access  counselling   and   medical
    treatment in Sierra Leone particularly in the context  of  the  reports
    which emphasised the risk of suicide.  I take  that  seriously  on  the
    basis of the evidence of the appellant's wife.

64. The appellant has been in stable employment at Tesco working as a shelf
    filler since early June  2016,  and  he  also  is  currently  receiving
    support and treatment from his local community mental  health  team  in
    order to help him with his childhood trauma.

65. His previous  convictions  alone  are  not  sufficient  grounds  for  a
    decision and I am not satisfied that  the  respondent  has  shown  that
    there is in practical reality a risk of reoffending.  Even if that were
    not the case it is five years since the  last  index  offence  and  the
    appellant has undertaken significant work in showing his commitment  to
    moving forward with his life and rehabilitation.  He continues to  work
    part-time and care for his daughter.  I take into account his  previous
    traumatic experiences and that he had  not  been  diagnosed  with  PTSD
    until approximately two years ago.  The  appellant's  daughter  however
    and his key role as her primary carer is a  very  important  protective
    factor guarding against him falling  into  making  further  potentially
    catastrophic and life changing choices.

66. As I state, he has been in the UK for over seventeen years in a  stable
    and supportive relationship with his wife of eleven years  and  she  is
    completing her legal training course in order  to  become  a  solicitor
    which must have taken great courage and determination in  the  face  of
    such adversity.

67. In view of all of the above factors I  find  that  the  impact  on  the
    appellant's deportation will be severe  on  his  family  unit  and  the
    impact on his mental health would be to say the  least  difficult.   As
    such, I also find that  the  decision  to  remove  him  under  the  EEA
    Regulations would be disproportionate.

68. Without the protection of the European Economic  Area  Regulations  the
    appellant would be subject to  an  automatic  deportation  order  under
    Section 32 of the UK Borders Act 2007.  The facts are those relevant at
    the date of hearing. It is self-evident that the proposed removal  will
    be an interference with the exercise of the applicant's right to family
    life and the interference will have a consequence of such gravity as to
    engage the operation of Article 8.  The deportation  ostensibly  is  in
    accordance with the law (in the event that the provisions under the EEA
    Regulations were not met) and necessary for the prevention of crime and
    disorder.   The position of the  Secretary  of  State  in  relation  to
    Article 8 is set out under the Immigration Rules.  Under paragraph  398
    of the Immigration Rules where a person claims their deportation  would
    be contrary to the UK's obligations under Article 8 of the Human Rights
    Act and the appellant was convicted of an offence for which  they  have
    been sentenced to a period of less than four years but at least  twelve
    months, the Secretary of State will in assessing  that  claim  consider
    whether paragraph 399 or 399A applies and if it  does  not  the  public
    interest in deportation will only be outweighed by other factors  where
    there are very compelling circumstances over and above those  described
    in paragraphs 399 and 399A.

69. Further to paragraph 399, the appellant has a  genuine  and  subsisting
    parental relationship with a child under the age of 18 years who is  in
    the UK and is a British citizen.  I have no  hesitation  in  concluding
    that it would be unduly harsh for the child to live in Sierra Leone and
    no-one contended otherwise.

70. KO (Nigeria)  [2018]  UKSC  53  confirmed  that  unduly  harsh  clearly
    intended to introduce a higher  hurdle  than  of  reasonableness  under
    Section 117B(6) and that one was looking  for  a  degree  of  harshness
    going beyond what would necessarily be involved  for  any  child  faced
    with the deportation of a parent.  The reference in MK (Sierra Leone) v
    Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department  [2015]  UKUT  223  (IAC)
    referred to an evaluative assessment required by the Tribunal and that

         "By way of self-direction, we are mindful that  unduly  harsh  does
         not equate with uncomfortable, inconvenient, undesirable or  merely
         difficult.  Rather  it  postulates  a  considerably  more  elevated
         threshold.  Harsh in this  context  denotes  something  severe,  or
         bleak.  It is the antithesis of pleasant or  comfortable.   Further
         the addition of  the  adverb  unduly  raises  an  already  elevated
         standard still higher".

71. As the primary carer for the child, who is now nearly 2  years  old,  I
    also conclude that it would be unduly harsh for the child to remain  in
    the UK without the person who is to be deported, that is the appellant.
    The appellant speaks  English  and  is  financially  independent.   The
    evidence of Ms Davies  confirmed  that  parental  absence  can  have  a
    profound impact upon children and the importance of children being well
    equipped with human and social capital for success as they enter school
    and society.  I accept the evidence of the wife of the appellant and  I
    note that she confirmed the devastating effect it  would  have  on  the
    child, and on the family which in  turn  would  affect  the  child  yet
    further, should the father be removed.

72. Both under the Immigration Rules at paragraph 399 and  in  relation  to
    Section 117C I conclude that the removal of the child from her  father,
    as a primary carer, for the reasons given above would be unduly  harsh.



73. For the reasons given above I allow the appeal.



Decision:

I allow the appeal of Mr M under the Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)
Regulations 2006 and on human rights grounds.


Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of  court  proceedings.   I  have
made this order because there is a minor involved.
