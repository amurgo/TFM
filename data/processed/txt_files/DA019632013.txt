Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms P Hastings, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr R Singer, Counsel instructed by Fisher Meredith


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The respondent shall hereinafter be referred to as the  claimant.   The
    Secretary of State has been granted permission to appeal  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal (First-tier Tribunal Judge Moore and Mrs S I
    Hewitt)  allowing the appeal of the claimant against  the  decision  of
    the Secretary of State to make a deportation order against  him  on  11
    September 2013 under Section 32(5) of the UK  Borders  Act  2007.   The
    Secretary of State found that the removal of the claimant under Section
    32(4) of the UK Borders Act 2007 to be conducive to the public good for
    the purposes of Section  3(5)(a)  of  the  Immigration  Act  1971.  The
    Secretary of State was not satisfied that the claimant fell within  one
    of the exceptions for automatic deportation under Section 32(5) of  the
    UK Borders Act 2007, following convictions  for  violent  disorder  for
    which he was sentenced to a total of 42 months' imprisonment.

2.   The claimant appealed the Secretary of State's decision  on  the  basis
    that his deportation would breach the UK's obligations under  the  1950
    Convention on Human Rights.  The First-tier Tribunal upheld his appeal.



3.   The claimant has previous convictions.   Between  June  2006  and  June
    2009 he was convicted and sentenced in respect of a number of  criminal
    offences committed whilst he was a  juvenile.   The  offences  included
    robbery, taking a motor vehicle without consent, theft  and  possession
    of  cannabis.   The  sentences  imposed  included  supervision  orders,
    attendance centre for twelve hours and a conditional discharge for  six
    months in respect of the possession of cannabis.  In  January  2013  he
    was convicted of possessing cannabis for which he was fined ï¿½100.

4.   In a nutshell the Secretary of State's grounds  upon  which  permission
    was granted argued that the panel failed  to  consider  the  claimant's
    right to family life under paragraph 399(b) but  instead  proceeded  to
    consider family life under Article 8 and that the panel  did  not  make
    any findings as to exceptional circumstances.

5.   At the hearing before me Mr Singer sought to  correct  paragraph  3  of
    the skeleton argument he had submitted on behalf of the  claimant.   He
    accepted that the claimant could not satisfy paragraph 399(b)(i) of the
    Immigration Rules.   This is because he had not lived in  the  UK  with
    valid leave continuously for at least  the  fifteen  years  immediately
    preceding the date of the immigration decision.   The claimant was born
    on 12 September 1991 in Barbados.  According to  his  evidence  he  had
    come to the United Kingdom in 2002 when he was 10 years of age.  He was
    eventually granted indefinite leave to remain in the United Kingdom  in
    March 2010.  Therefore, quite apart from the fact that the claimant had
    not lived continuously in the United Kingdom for at least  the  fifteen
    years immediately preceding the date of the immigration decision  which
    was taken on 11 September 2013, he did not have valid leave  to  remain
    until March 2010.

6.   There are two sub-Sections to paragraph 399(b).  I have  already  dealt
    with sub-section (i) above, which as already noted, Mr. Singer conceded
    the claimant could not satisfy.  Sub-section  (ii)  states  "there  are
    insurmountable obstacles to family life with  that  partner  continuing
    outside the UK."  Ms Hastings submitted, and I agreed, that because  of
    the word "and" linking the two sub-sections, the claimant would have to
    satisfy both sub-sections in order to satisfy  paragraph  399(b).   His
    inability to satisfy sub-section (i) meant that he  could  not  satisfy
    sub-section (ii).  Consequently I find that  Mr  Singer's  argument  at
    paragraphs 5 and 6 of his skeleton argument where he had submitted that
    the panel accepted that there  were  insurmountable  obstacles  to  the
    relationship between  the  claimant  and  his  partner  Shanice  Wilson
    continuing outside of the UK did not contain alleged error of law,  was
    not an argument that could succeed.

7.   Ms Hastings relied on the grounds submitted on behalf of the  Secretary
    of State.  She submitted that instead  of  the  panel  considering  the
    Immigration Rules and applying them, they elect to consider  Article  8
    outside of the Immigration Rules.  The  only  exceptional  circumstance
    identified by the panel was the claimant's partner's choice as  to  the
    reason why the relationship could not continue in Barbados.  There  was
    no health issue, no  overwhelming  economic  issue  in  this  case.  Ms
    Hastings submitted that there are  family  members  in  Barbados.   The
    facts are nothing out of the ordinary such that there  are  exceptional
    circumstances that go beyond and above the Immigration Rules.

8.    Mr  Singer  submitted  that  whatever  the  complaint  was  about  the
    structure of the determination, it did not contain any error that could
    amount to a material error.  He referred to his skeleton argument  that
    was before the panel.  He had relied on the case of MF (Article 8 - new
    rules) Nigeria [2012] UKUT 00393 (IAC) where it was held that even if a
    decision to refuse an Article 8 claim under the new Rules is  found  to
    be correct,  judge  must  still  consider  whether  a  decision  is  in
    compliance with a person's human rights under Section 6  of  the  Human
    Rights Act and in automatic deportation cases where the  removal  would
    breach  a  person's  Convention  rights.   Thus,  in  the  context   of
    deportation and removal cases, the need for  a  two-stage  approach  in
    most Article 8 cases remains imperative.  The Court of Appeal  endorsed
    that  approach  and  stated  that  if  the  claimant  succeeds  on   an
    application of the new Rules at the first hurdle, that is he shows that
    paragraph 399 or 399A  applies,  then  it  can  be  said  that  he  has
    succeeded on a one-stage test.  But if he does not, it is necessary  to
    consider  whether  there  are  circumstances  which  are   sufficiently
    compelling (and therefore exceptional) to outweigh the public  interest
    in  deportation.   This  is  an  exercise  which  is  separate  from  a
    consideration of whether paragraph 399 or  399A  applies.   It  is  the
    second part of a two-stage approach which is required by the new Rules.
     In light of these decisions Mr. Singer submitted that as the  claimant
    did not meet paragraph 399 or 399A, the Tribunal was required to  apply
    a two-stage test.  Mr Singer accepted that although the panel  did  not
    expressly state  whether  they  were  allowing  the  appeal  under  the
    Immigration Rules, they were well aware from his skeleton argument  how
    the claimant's case was argued.  It was argued on the  basis  that  the
    Tribunal had to consider whether there were  exceptional  circumstances
    whereby the public interest was outweighed by the claimant's Article  8
    rights.  In his skeleton argument he  set  out  the  principles  of  SS
    (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ 550 which held that  the  more  pressing  the
    public interest the more serious is the deportation.  Although this  is
    not expressly quoted, he would argue that the Tribunal had it in  mind.
    The decision to allow the claimant's appeal on Article  8  grounds  was
    open to the Tribunal on the reasons given by them.

9.   I  find  that  the  Tribunal  at  paragraphs  2  to  5  identified  the
    substantive issues under appeal.  At paragraph 32 they  identified  the
    legal framework and recited case law in respect of  Article  8  of  the
    ECHR.  The case law included MF (Nigeria).

10.  At paragraph 40 the Tribunal  identified  that  paragraph  396  of  the
    Rules established that where a person is  liable  to  deportation,  the
    public interest requires it.  Where the Secretary of State must make  a
    deportation order in accordance with Section 32 of the UK  Borders  Act
    2007, it is in the public interest to deport.

11.  The Tribunal then looked at paragraph 398 where a  person  claims  that
    their deportation would be  contrary  to  the  UK's  obligations  under
    Article 8 of the ECHR.  At paragraph 41 the  Tribunal  recognised  that
    the claimant has been convicted of serious offences for  which  he  was
    sentenced to a total of 42 months'  imprisonment.   The  Tribunal  took
    note of the Immigration Rules which state that  it  would  only  be  in
    exceptional circumstances  that  a  person's  right  to  family  and/or
    private life would outweigh the public interest in deporting  a  person
    where they have been sentenced to a period of imprisonment of less than
    four years, but at least twelve months.  At this point I must add  that
    it is in assessing whether paragraph 399 or 399A  applies,  and  if  it
    does not, that it will  only  be  exceptional  circumstances  that  the
    public interest will be outweighed by other factors.

12.  I find that the determination could  have  been  better  structured  so
    that the reader was left in no  doubt  as  to  whether  the  claimant's
    appeal could succeed under the Immigration Rules. The Tribunal did  not
    do that.  I agree with Mr. Singer that the Tribunal's failure to so did
    not amount to a material error of law.   It was apparent from the facts
    that the claimant's appeal could  not  succeed  under  the  family  and
    private life provisions under the Immigration Rules. This  led  to  Mr.
    Singer putting the claimant's argument on the basis that  the  Tribunal
    had to consider whether there were  exceptional  circumstances  whereby
    the public interest was outweighed by the claimant's Article 8  rights.
     This required the application of the two-stage approach identified  in
    MF (Nigeria) and the principles in Nagre [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin)  where
    it would only be in exceptional circumstances that a person's right  to
    family and/or private  life  would  outweigh  the  public  interest  in
    deportation.

13.  I find that in view of the way the  claimant's  case  was  put  to  the
    Tribunal by Mr. Singer, the Tribunal's findings at paragraphs 42 to  47
    could be described as exceptional circumstances.  That  was  what  they
    had in mind at paragraph 41 before proceeding to make their findings at
    paragraphs 42 to 47.   The  Tribunal  considered  the  close  bond  the
    claimant has with his mother and his two younger siblings,  Nathan  and
    Stacia.  They found that  although  the  claimant  was  an  adult,  the
    relationship the claimant had with his mother went  beyond  the  normal
    emotional ties due to the fact that he is the only son  of  his  mother
    who remains in the United Kingdom with whom  the  mother  continues  to
    rely on for  emotional  support.   Consequently  they  found  that  the
    claimant satisfied the Kugathas test.  However, the significant  factor
    in all of this  was  the  claimant's  relationship  with  his  partner,
    Shanice Wilson.

14.  The Tribunal were impressed by the evidence given at  the  hearing  not
    only by Shanice Wilson but  by  both  her  parents.   They  found  that
    evidence pointed to a deep  and  meaningful  relationship  between  the
    claimant and his partner.  They found at paragraph 42 that the claimant
    now regretted his criminal offending.  Mr & Mrs  Wilson  believed  that
    the daughter was genuinely in love with the claimant and would continue
    to encourage him and support  him.   Shanice  has  not  only  regularly
    visited the claimant in prison but she was  also  accompanied  on  some
    occasions by her mother.  The Tribunal considered that despite the deep
    relationship they believe that Ms Wilson would not go  to  Barbados  if
    the claimant were to be removed.  Her life, career and family  are  all
    in  the  UK.   She  is  a  British  citizen.   Consequently  in   these
    circumstances were  the  claimant  to  be  deported  to  Barbados,  the
    relationship between Ms Wilson and the claimant would break  down  with
    no  reasonable  likelihood  of  marriage  in  the   future.    In   the
    circumstances the Tribunal found at paragraph 47  that  the  claimant's
    right to  family  life  would  be  infringed  in  that  his  subsisting
    relationship with his partner would irretrievably break down, since she
    would not accompany him to Barbados for the  reasons  they  had  given.
    Consequently the Tribunal accepted that the claimant's right to  family
    life outweighed the public interest in his deportation.

15.  The Tribunal then looked at the claimant's private life and found  that
    he had lived in the UK since the age of 10  and  for  the  past  twelve
    years.   In  so  doing  they  considered  paragraph  399A(b)   of   the
    Immigration Rules, which they said defines the criteria which  must  be
    satisfied before a person's private life outweighs the public  interest
    for deportation in line with Article 8 of the EHCR.  The Tribunal found
    that while the  claimant  could  not  demonstrate  that  he  had  lived
    continuously in the United Kingdom for half of his life  preceding  the
    date of the immigration decision, the period of time he had spent  here
    was a significant factor notwithstanding the nature and seriousness  of
    the index offence.  They were satisfied that the claimant would not  be
    able to re-establish  and  maintain  a  private  life  if  deported  to
    Barbados.  Consequently they accepted  that  the  claimant's  right  to
    private life outweighed the public interest in seeing him deported  and
    that the deportation would breach Article 8 of the ECHR.

16.  Having considered the determination as a whole, I  do  not  accept  the
    submission that the  Tribunal  engaged  in  a  freewheeling  Article  8
    exercise.  The Tribunal had at the forefront of its mind the fact  that
    the claimant was a foreign criminal as defined in Section 32 of the  UK
    Borders Act in that public interest  requires  his  deportation.   They
    looked  at  the  evidence  before  them  and  found  that  there   were
    exceptional circumstances which outweighed the public interest  in  his
    deportation.  The Tribunal heard the evidence and I find that they came
    to conclusions that were open to them.

17.  For these reasons I find that  the  Tribunal's  decision  allowing  the
    claimant's appeal shall stand.
