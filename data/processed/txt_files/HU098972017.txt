Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr M Nadeem
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant has been granted permission to  appeal  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Grimmett dismissing his  appeal  against  the
    decision of the respondent on 22 August 2017 to  refuse  him  leave  to
    remain in the UK under Article 8 as the husband of  a  British  citizen
    and father of a British child.

2.   The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born  on  1  January  1992.   He
    entered the UK in October 2013 with valid leave to enter  as  a  spouse
    until 20 June 2016.  He and his wife have a child who was 3  years  old
    in April 2018 when the judge heard the appeal.

3.   At the hearing before the judge the respondent's position was that  the
    appellant did not meet  the  requirements  of  the  Rules  because  his
    partner was not earning �18,600 per annum.  It was accepted that he and
    his wife have a child but the child and his mother  were  both  British
    citizens and the child could remain in the UK  with  his  mother.   The
    respondent  was  not  satisfied  that  there   were   any   exceptional
    circumstances.

4.   The judge held as follows:

         "6.  Mr  Authi  accepted  that  the  appellant  did  not  meet  the
             financial requirements but said that  there  were  exceptional
             circumstances.  The reason the appellant could  not  meet  the
             requirements was that his wife had had a baby  and  the  child
             suffered from acid reflux which meant that he  was  frequently
             vomiting and also had serious eczema which  required  frequent
             attention as a result of which his wife was  not  able  to  go
             back to work as soon as she had expected.  Her current  income
             was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the rules.  The
             appellant had worked after they married in the United  Kingdom
             and they then had an income sufficient for the family but as a
             result of the child's illness the rules  were  not  met.   The
             appellant's wife confirmed that she earned �15,200  per  annum
             and also received child tax credit of �250 a month.


         7.   The best interest of the child are to  remain  with  both  his
             parents.  Whether that is in the UK or Pakistan is not at this
             stage of his life important.  It may  be  that  education  and
             healthcare are better in the UK than Pakistan but  at  present
             his parents provide all his practical and emotional  needs  in
             light of his age.  His interests are not, however,  paramount.
             I  am  not  satisfied  that  the  child's  ill-health  is   an
             insurmountable obstacle to family life continuing outside  the
             United Kingdom.  The child is now going to  nursery  part-time
             and his illnesses are  being  treated.   However,  it  is  not
             reasonable to expect the child, who is British, to  leave  the
             United Kingdom with the  appellant.   The  child  is  able  to
             remain in the United Kingdom with his mother.


         8.   The problem for the appellant is that his wife does  not  earn
             the �18,600 per annum required under  the  immigration  rules.
             Were she able to do so I would have been  satisfied  that  the
             rules were met.  They are not, however, and that will mean the
             family lives of the appellant  his  wife  and  child  will  be
             interfered with.  As I can find no insurmountable obstacle  to
             family  life  continuing  outside  the  United   Kingdom   the
             appellant must either return to Pakistan with  his  family  or
             return to seek entry clearance as a spouse.  The fact that his
             wife does not currently earn sufficient to allow  him  to  re-
             enter does not mean that the rules ca be overlooked.   If  the
             appellant's  wife  can  obtain   alternative   employment   or
             additional  employment  to  increase  her  income   there   is
             currently nothing to suggest that an application for leave  to
             enter as a spouse would not succeed.   The  interference  with
             the family lives by the decision, should the appellant's  wife
             and child remain in the UK, is proportionate to the legitimate
             aim of immigration control and the economic well-being of  the
             UK.  Those seeking leave to enter the United Kingdom  to  live
             are required to show  a  minimum  level  of  financial  report
             support which this appellant currently cannot do."

5.   Permission to appeal the judge's decision  was  granted  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge C A Parker.  Judge Parker held that the  judge  did  not
    apply the test in Razgar and made no reference to the  public  interest
    factors in S.117B of the 2002 NIA Act, in particular,  Section  117B(6)
    which requires a consideration  of  whether  it  is  reasonable  for  a
    qualifying child to leave or remain  in  the  UK  without  one  of  his
    parents.  The judge made no findings as to the child's best  interests.
    The ability of an applicant to meet the requirements of the Immigration
    Rules is a relevant factor in  the  proportionality  exercise  but  the
    judge referred only to the financial requirement in  the  Rules,  which
    the appellant could not meet.  There was no reference to Agyarko [2017]
    UKSC 11 or to MA (Pakistan) [2016] EWCA Civ 705.

6.   Mr Nadeem submitted that the judge failed to look at EX.1 which  is  an
    exception to the Rule.  According to EX.1(a) if  the  appellant  has  a
    genuine parental relationship with a British  child  and  it  would  be
    unreasonable for the child to leave the UK, the appeal can  potentially
    be allowed.  He further submitted that  according  to  EX.1(b)  if  the
    appellant has a genuine and subsisting relationship  with  his  partner
    then there would be an insurmountable obstacle to the  partner  leaving
    the UK and living abroad with the appellant.

7.   Mr Nadeem submitted that Section  117A-D  was  relevant  in  particular
    Section 117(B)(6) because the appellant is not being deported.   If  he
    has a genuine parental relationship with a qualifying  child,  then  it
    would not be reasonable for the appellant to be removed from the UK.

8.   Mr Nadeem submitted that in the light  of  the  findings  made  by  the
    judge at paragraph 7, especially the judge's acceptance that  the  best
    interests of the child are to remain with both his  parents,  then  the
    appeal ought to have been allowed.  Furthermore, in the  light  of  the
    same findings at paragraph 7, and since  the  appellant  is  not  being
    deported, it would not be in the public interest for the  appellant  to
    be removed to Pakistan.

9.   Mr Tufan relied on JG (S.117B(6):  "reasonable  to  leave"  UK)  Turkey
    (Rev 1) [2019] UKUT 72 (IAC) (15 February 2019).  Mr Tufan said that JG
    assists the appellant.  He referred the court to paragraph  89  wherein
    it was held:

         "89. Section 117B(6) concerns an assessment of  the  reasonableness
             of  a  child's  leaving  the  United  Kingdom.   It  does  not
             expressly demand an assessment of reasonableness by  reference
             to the length of time the child is expected to be outside  the
             United Kingdom.  In the light of paragraphs 18 and  19  of  KO
             (Nigeria), the  child's  destination  and  future  are  to  be
             assumed to be with a person who has been removed.  In  a  case
             where the respondent's position is  that  the  person  who  is
             being removed can be  expected  to  make  an  entry  clearance
             application, does this require the  Tribunal's  assessment  to
             take this into account, in determining  whether  it  would  be
             reasonable for the child to leave?  There may, obviously, be a
             good deal of difference between a  child  living  outside  the
             United Kingdom for a matter of months and facing an indefinite
             period abroad."

10.  The tribunal went on to hold at paragraph 9:

         "92. In any event, in determining whether it  would  be  reasonable
             for children to  leave  in  these  circumstances,  the  likely
             temporary nature of the absence from the  United  Kingdom  may
             well be said (as in the present case) to make it  unreasonable
             to expect the child to leave.  ..."

11.  In the light of the findings made by  the  judge  at  paragraph  7,  Mr
    Tufan conceded that it would not be reasonable for the child  to  leave
    the UK.

12.  In the light of the submissions made by Mr Tufan and Mr Nadeem and  the
    judge's findings at paragraph  7  I  find  that  the  judge's  decision
    dismissing the appellant's appeal cannot stand.

13.  Accordingly I remake the decision.

14.  The appellant's appeal is allowed given the findings made by the  judge
    at paragraph 7 of her decision combined with the findings made in JG by
    the Upper Tribunal.  I  find  that  as  the  appellant  has  a  genuine
    parental  relationship  with  his  British-born  chid,  it   would   be
    unreasonable for the child to leave the  UK  in  order  to  maintain  a
    relationship with the appellant.   Equally,  as  the  appellant  has  a
    genuine and subsisting relationship with his partner, there would be an
    insurmountable obstacle to the partner leaving the UK and living abroad
    with  the  appellant.   Accordingly,  I  find  that  it  would  not  be
    reasonable for the appellant to be removed from the UK.

15.  The appellant's appeal is allowed.

No anonymity direction is made.
