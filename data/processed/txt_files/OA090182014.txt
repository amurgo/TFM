Representation:
For the claimant: No attendance
For the respondent:    Mr I Jarvis, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against  the  decision  of
    First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Brown  promulgated  7.5.15,  allowing  the
    claimant's appeal against the decision of the  Secretary  of  State  to
    refuse his application for entry clearance to the United Kingdom as the
    child of a parent settled in the UK.  The Judge  heard  the  appeal  on
    5.5.15.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge  Ransley  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    1.4.16.

 3. Thus the matter came before me on 26.5.16 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

 4. There was no attendance by the sponsor or otherwise on  behalf  of  the
    claimant. I am satisfied that notice of today's hearing was sent to the
    sponsor at the same address as appears on all documentation in the file
    and there is no explanation for her absence. In any event the  claimant
    did not have an appointed representative. In the circumstances, I found
    that the overriding objective was best met in this case  by  proceeding
    to hear the case as I am permitted to do  by  virtue  of  the  Tribunal
    Rules.

Error of Law

 5. For the reasons set out herein, I found such error of law in the making
    of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal as to require  the  decision
    of Judge Brown to be set aside and remade by dismissing the appeal.

 6. The relevant background to the appeal  can  be  summarised  briefly  as
    follows.  The  claimant  applied  for  entry  clearance  to  join   his
    sponsoring  mother,  Luzviminda  Roman,  now  a  British  citizen.  The
    relationship has been confirmed by DNA analysis.  The  sponsor  claimed
    that she had three cleaning/housekeeping jobs, with a total  income  of
    �1,600 per month, paid in cash. The Entry Clearance Officer noted  that
    the claimed income was not shown in the submitted  bank  statements  or
    the Class 2 NI contributions, but, curiously, the bank account did show
    receipt of Job Seekers  Allowance  (JSA).  In  consequence,  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer was not satisfied of the income claimed and thus  the
    claimant failed to establish that he would be maintained adequately  in
    the UK without recourse to public funds, pursuant to  paragraph  297(v)
    of the Immigration Rules.

 7. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Ransley found it arguable  that
    the First-tier Tribunal Judge erred by failing to give adequate reasons
    for finding that the sponsor was able to meet the adequate  maintenance
    requirements under paragraph 297 of the Immigration Rules.

 8. Judge Ransley also found it arguable that the judge failed to resolve a
    key issue raised by the Entry Clearance Officer, namely the credibility
    of the JSA paid into the sponsor's bank account. I  am  satisfied  that
    this issue was resolved.  It  is  implicit  if  not  explicit  that  by
    accepting the  sponsor's  evidence  in  its  entirety,  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge also accepted the explanation for the JSA.

 9. Before the First-tier Tribunal, the  sponsor  relied  on  very  limited
    documentary support to establish her cleaning/housekeeping work, namely
    letters purporting to be from the household employers. Whilst  they  do
    not match the weekly or monthly income, the bank statements do show  an
    overall credit balance with occasional cash deposits.

10. As far as the JSA payments are concerned, the sponsor gave evidence  to
    the First-tier Tribunal that she had made her account  available  to  a
    friend from the Philippines whose own account had been frozen, and that
    the friend's name and NI number was used for the payments.  The  appeal
    bundle contains a copy of  the  passport  and  visa  vignette  of  this
    person, showing that until 2011 she had leave to remain as  a  domestic
    worker. Evidently this person had no leave to remain at the time of the
    JSA payments in question. The  payments  were  made  in  September  and
    October 2013, but the claimant said she had not been  able  to  contact
    her friend and heard that she had returned to  the  Philippines.  Judge
    Brown accepted this explanation, noting  at  �12  that  the  NI  number
    relating to the JSA payments is different to that of the claimant.

11. The decision was reviewed by the Entry Clearance Manager,  who  pointed
    out that there is no evidence to support the claim that the JSA was for
    another person and that the DWP would not in fact make such payments to
    a 3rd party account.

12. The sponsor stated that she  did  not  receive  payslips  and  had  not
    retained a copy of her hand-completed tax return for  the  year  ending
    April 2014. However, the decision was made in July 2014 and the sponsor
    thus  had  several  months  before  the  appeal  in  which  to  produce
    documentary evidence. The judge accepted that the sponsor had made some
    NI contributions, as confirmed by the submitted HMRC documentation. The
    sponsor claimed that she paid cash from her earnings into  the  account
    when she had time.

13. It evident  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  accepted  in  their
    entirety the claimant's evidence as to her employment, regarding her at
    �19 as  an  honest  and  reliable  witness  and  finding  her  evidence
    consistent with the documentary evidence, namely letters from the three
    employers. In the circumstances the judge  allowed  the  appeal,  being
    satisfied that her net income exceeded the requirements of the Rules so
    that the claimant would be adequately maintained.

14. Most would have found the sponsor's explanations highly suspicious  and
    less than credible. I accept, however,  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge  had  the  opportunity  to  consider  not  only  the  documentary
    evidence, which is limited, but also the  sponsor's  oral  evidence.  A
    judge is not  bound  to  reject  the  account  because  of  absence  of
    documentary support. The  judge  believed  the  sponsor  and  thus  her
    account was accepted.

15. However, I find that the judge  has  failed  to  properly  address  the
    absence of evidence which might reasonably have been  obtained  and  to
    provide cogent reasons for accepting the sponsor's  assertions  without
    actually engaging in any way with the detail of the claimed income  and
    whether the sponsor had sufficient means to support the  claimant.  For
    example, there was no reference to the income  support  threshold.  The
    sponsor produced no evidence, and the judge made no calculation, of the
    sponsor's income and expenditure. The judge referenced  submissions  of
    the claimant's representative that there was a net income of �210,  but
    there was in fact no evidence before the Tribunal that she paid any tax
    at all on the cash in hand earning she had, though it would  have  been
    open to her to do so.  Further,  the  claimant's  bundle  contained  no
    household utility bills, or any form of breakdown or calculation.

16. I also find that there is inadequate reasoning for the conclusion  that
    the claimant would be adequately maintained, noting that the judge  did
    not grapple with this issue and merely made a blanket acceptance of the
    sponsor's evidence. Case authorities have made clear that the burden is
    on the (claimant) to establish by  cogent  evidence  that  he  will  be
    adequately maintained in the UK, so that he does not become a burden on
    the state. On the present evidence  it  was  impossible  to  reach  any
    objectively  justified  conclusion  that   he   would   be   adequately
    maintained.

17. There is no adequate evidence that the identity of  person  she  claims
    she was allowing to use her account to bank her JSA is the same  person
    as the passport and visa vignette produced by the sponsor,  as  opposed
    to the sponsor using that identity to falsely claim JSA whilst  working
    at the same time. There is no explanation as to how the sponsor came to
    have those identity documents when she  said  lost  contact  with  this
    person who has now, according to  the  sponsor,  perhaps  conveniently,
    returned to the Philippines. The judge does not resolve this  issue  of
    the JSA, which is highly relevant to the sponsor's credibility, and for
    that reason the decision is flawed and cannot stand.

18. In considering the remaking of the decision, I find  that  the  sponsor
    has failed to demonstrate the truth of her account not only in  respect
    of the JSA but also her claimed income. Her circumstances were  clearly
    capable of more cogent proof than mere assertions and the few documents
    in the claimant's bundle are woefully inadequate so that it is far more
    likely that the sponsor was working whilst dishonestly claiming JSA  in
    a false name and identity, and not declaring the cash income.

19. In the circumstances, and for the reasons stated, the appeal under  the
    Immigration Rules must fail. However, I have  gone  on  considered  the
    claimant's and the sponsor's article 8 rights.

20. Article 8 provides that:


           "Everyone has the right to respect for his  private  and  family
           life, his home and his correspondence.


           "There shall be no interference by a public authority  with  the
           exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with  the
           law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of
           national security, public safety or the economic  well-being  of
           the country, for the prevention of disorder or  crime,  for  the
           protection of health or morals, or for  the  protection  of  the
           rights and freedoms of others."


21. At paragraph 17 of Razgar v Secretary of State for the Home  Department
    [2004] UKHL 27, Lord Bingham of Cornhill stated:


           "In considering whether a challenge to the Secretary of  State's
           decision to remove a person must  clearly  fail,  the  reviewing
           court must, as it seems to me, consider how an appeal  would  be
           likely  to  fare  before  an  adjudicator,   as   the   Tribunal
           responsible for deciding the appeal if  there  were  an  appeal.
           This means that the reviewing court must ask itself  essentially
           the questions which would have to be answered by an adjudicator.
           In a case where removal is resisted in reliance  on  Article  8,
           these questions are likely to be:

                  (1) Will the proposed removal  be  an  interference  by  a
                 public body with the exercise of the applicant's  right  to
                 respect for his private or (as  the  case  may  be)  family
                 life?
                 (2) If so, will such interference have consequences of such
                 gravity as potentially to engage the operation  of  Article
                 8?
                  (3) If so, is such interference  in  accordance  with  the
                 law?

                  (4) If so, is such interference necessary in a  democratic
                 society in  the  interests  of  national  security,  public
                 safety or the economic well-being of the country,  for  the
                 prevention of disorder or  crime,  for  the  protection  of
                 health or morals, or for the protection of the  rights  and
                 freedoms of others?


                  (5) If so,  is  such  interference  proportionate  to  the
                 legitimate public end sought to be achieved?"


22. However, before article 8 ECHR can be considered outside the Rules  the
    claimant must demonstrate that  there  are  compelling  or  exceptional
    circumstances insufficiently recognised in the Rules so as  to  justify
    granting leave to remain outside Rules under article  8  ECHR,  on  the
    basis that the decision is unjustifiably harsh. In SSHD v SS (Congo)  &
    Ors [2015] EWCA Civ 387, the Court of Appeal re-stated the context  and
    considered the role of public policy as expressed in the Rules  in  the
    proportionality assessment. The decision maker is  entitled  to  decide
    that Article 8 considerations have been fully addressed  in  the  Rules
    when dealing with 'stage two'.  If they have, it is enough to  say  so.
    This will necessarily involve deciding whether there is a 'gap' between
    the Rules and Article 8, and then whether there  are  circumstances  in
    the case under consideration which take it outside the class  of  cases
    which the Rules properly provide for.  Whether these circumstances  are
    described  as  'compelling'  or  'exceptional'  is  not  a  matter   of
    substance.  They must be relevant, weighty, and not fully provided  for
    within the Rules.  In practice they are likely to  be  both  compelling
    and exceptional, but this is not a legal requirement.  The first stage,
    therefore, is to assess how completely  the  Rules  reflect  Article  8
    considerations.


23. Whilst I accept that the claimant is the  child  of  the  sponsor,  and
    there is a limited family life between them that they wish to  develop,
    I find no such compelling circumstances  in  this  case  insufficiently
    recognised in the Rules so as to render  the  decision  to  refuse  the
    application unjustifiably harsh. There is a route for  entry  clearance
    as a child within  the  Rules,  which  are  the  Secretary  of  State's
    proportionate response to private and  family  life  claims,  balancing
    those against the public interest. Article 8 is not a dispensing  power
    for those who fail to meet the Rules.

24. Any consideration of article 8 has to be seen through the prism of  the
    Rules, in respect of which it is highly relevant that the claimant  has
    been unable to meet, by the  failure  to  produce  sufficient  credible
    evidence. I am satisfied that the Rules as applied in this case  is  an
    adequate proportionality assessment. If the circumstances  are  as  the
    claimant and the sponsor claim, it will  be  open  to  make  a  further
    application addressing the reasons for refusal and properly documenting
    the income. As  it  stands,  even  if  I  conducted  a  Razgar  stepped
    approach,  the  decision  of  the  Secretary  of  State   is   entirely
    proportionate, balancing as it does the rights of the claimant and  the
    sponsor on one hand against on the other the legitimate  and  necessary
    aims  of  protecting  the  economic  well-being  of  the   UK   through
    immigration control.

Conclusions:

25. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should  be
    set aside.

     I set aside the decision.

                    I remake the decision in the appeal by dismissing it  on
                    immigration grounds and on human rights grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: It was  not  wrong  for  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  and  Entry
Clearance  Manager  to  be  sceptical  of  the  application,  evidence   and
explanation. The claimant should have provided  clearer  evidence  with  the
application.
