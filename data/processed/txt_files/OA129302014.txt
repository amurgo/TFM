Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Harrison, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Akhtar, McKenzie friend.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    1. The Respondent is a national of Pakistan date of  birth  25  November
       1986.  On the 30 March 2015 the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Levin)
       allowed her appeal against a decision to refuse to  grant  her  entry
       clearance as the spouse of a person present and settled in the United
       Kingdom. The Entry Clearance Officer now  has  permission  to  appeal
       against that decision.

    2. The only matter in issue on appeal was  whether  the  Respondent,  or
       rather her British Sponsor Mr Hussain, had complied with all  of  the
       requirements of Appendix FM-SE.  The sole ground for refusal was that
       he had failed to produce bank statements showing the regular  deposit
       of his salary, as required by paragraph 2 (c).

    3. It is not now in issue that the Sponsor does  earn  over  the  amount
       required by Appendix FM  to  show  adequate  maintenance.  His  gross
       annual income of over �20,000 comes from two jobs. Since October 2012
       he has been employed as a garage manager for  Auto  Point  and  earns
       �17,680 per annum. He has another job, as an administrator,  for  STU
       Communications Ltd, that  has  earned  him,  since  January  2013,  a
       further �216 per week.  Both  these  jobs  are  cash  in  hand.  This
       application was made on the 30th September 2013 and a complete set of
       wage slips for both jobs were submitted with the  application.  Since
       he had held both jobs  for  longer  than  six  months,  he  was  only
       required to show six months worth of documents.

    4. In a review conducted on the 25th November 2014 by an Entry Clearance
       Manager two problems were identified with the Halifax statements that
       had also been submitted with the application. The first was that they
       did not cover the same period as the wage slips. They did  not  start
       until March 2013, and the ECM appears to have  considered  that  they
       had to cover the entire period of employment.  The second  difficulty
       was that the Sponsor's income could not be seen being deposited  into
       the account.

    5. When the matter came before the  First-tier  Tribunal  the  first  of
       these issues was resolved in the Respondent's favour. The application
       was made on the 30th September 2014 so the relevant six-month  period
       could be taken to  be  March  to  September  of  that  year.  Halifax
       statements had been produced to cover that. There was no  requirement
       that they go back to October 2012 when Mr  Hussain  started  at  Auto
       Point.  This finding is not now subject to challenge.

    6. As to the second problem Mr Hussain conceded that he had  not  always
       paid all of his salary straight into the bank.  Having  received  his
       salary in cash he would use some for living expenses and then pay the
       rest into the bank. The HOPO on the day calculated that  between  the
       1st March 2014 and the 31st August  2014  the  Sponsor  had  received
       �10,173 in cash but had  only  paid  �8070  of  that  into  his  bank
       account.

    7. Those figures being accepted, the First-tier Tribunal directed itself
       to paragraph 1(n) of Appendix FM-SE which stipulates that:

           '(n) The gross amount of any cash income may  be  counted  where
           the person's specified bank statements show the net amount which
           relates to the gross amount shown on their payslips (or  in  the
           relevant  specified  evidence  provided  in  addition   to   the
           specified bank statements in relation to non-employment income).
           Otherwise, only the net  amount  shown  on  the  specified  bank
           statements may be counted.'

    8. Of this the determination says the following:

           "Having regard to the wording of paragraph 1(n) set out above  I
           find that in order to be able to take into account her Sponsor's
           gross earnings the  Appellant  is  required  to  show  that  her
           Sponsor's bank details relate to (my emphasis) the gross  amount
           shown on his bank statements. With reference to  paragraph  2(c)
           the Respondent accepts that the Sponsor  has  provided  personal
           bank statements corresponding with the same period as  the  wage
           slips. The requirement in paragraph 2(c) is merely that the bank
           statements should show that the salary has been  paid  into  the
           bank  account  and  there  is  not  requirement  that  the  bank
           statements should show precisely the same amount. In the absence
           of either paragraph 1(n) or 2 (c) of Appendix  FM-SE  containing
           such a requirement I reject the Respondent's submission that the
           bank statements must mirror precisely the  wage-slips.  If  this
           were what was required then Appendix FM-SE should have said so".

    9. Judge Levin goes on to  explain  that  he  has  taken  the  following
       matters into account in so interpreting the provisions of Appendix FM-
       SE. The purpose of the provisions is to seek  corroboration  that  an
       individual is in fact employed. The bank statements in this case show
       approximately 80% of the Sponsor's income being deposited and he  was
       an entirely credible witness in explaining  that  the  remaining  20%
       went on living expenses. If it were needed further  corroboration  of
       the Sponsor's employment  was  provided  by  the  P60s  submitted  on
       appeal, the HOPOs submission that the Tribunal was  not  entitled  to
       take these into account being rejected.  Having regard  to  the  wage
       slips, the letters from the employers, the P60s, the bank  statements
       and the credible oral evidence the Tribunal  was  satisfied  that  Mr
       Hussain is employed as he claims and that  he  earns  well  over  the
       �18,600 gross annual income required by Appendix FM.  The appeal  was
       allowed for that reason.

   10. The Entry Clearance Officer now appeals on the grounds that the First-
       tier Tribunal "failed to give adequate  reasons  for  findings  on  a
       material matter". The grounds do not specify what  that  failing,  or
       the material matter, is. The particulars appear to  allege  a  wholly
       different error, namely "drawing conclusions  not  open  to  him"  in
       respect of paragraph 1(n) of FM-SE.

  My Findings

   11. The Tribunal made a finding of fact that  this  sponsor  had,  for  a
       period of at least six months  prior  to  the  application,  been  in
       employment that attracted an annual salary of in excess  of  �20,000.
       As Mr Harrison made clear, that finding  is  not  challenged  by  the
       Entry Clearance Officer.

   12. Rather  the  complaint  is  that  the  Sponsor  could  not  meet  the
       evidential requirements set out in paragraph 2(c) of FM-SE:

           '(c)  Personal  bank  statements  corresponding  to   the   same
           period(s) as the payslips at paragraph 2(a),  showing  that  the
           salary has been paid into an account in the name of  the  person
           or in the name of the person and their partner jointly.'

   13. The First-tier Tribunal read this paragraph, as it is accepted it was
       entitled to do, in line with 1(n).  It's reasoning is set out  above.
       Neither the grounds, nor Mr Harrison, were able to identify where the
       First-tier Tribunal erred in its reasoning.  The  sum  of  �8070  was
       deposited during the relevant six-month period and  as  a  matter  of
       fact this related to the sponsor's salary. The  bank  statements  did
       show his salary being deposited. As Judge Levin observes, nowhere  is
       it  said  that  the  entire  salary  must  be  so   deposited.   That
       interpretation is supported by having regard to the  purpose  of  the
       Rule. It being accepted that Mr Hussain does in fact have those  jobs
       and that income, it is difficult to  see  what  public  interest  was
       served by bringing this appeal.

   14. I would also note that the sum of �8070 net in a six-month period  in
       fact exceeds the minimum  net  income  required  by  Appendix  FM  E-
       ECP.3.1.   On an annual salary of �18,600 the UK taxpayer was in 2013
       likely to take home approximately �7733 in a six month period.

   15. This was a careful, detailed and cogent determination which  contains
       no error of law.

  Decisions

   16. The determination contains no  error  of  law  and  the  decision  is
       upheld.
