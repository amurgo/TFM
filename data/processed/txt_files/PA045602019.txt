     DECISION PURSUANT TO RULE 40(3)(a) OF THE TRIBUNAL PROCEDURE (UPPER
                            TRIBUNAL) RULES 2008

 1. Although the appellant in these proceedings is the Secretary of  State,
    it is convenient to continue to refer  to  the  parties  as  they  were
    before the First-tier Tribunal ("FtT").

 2. The appellant, a citizen of Iran, appealed to the  First-tier  Tribunal
    ("FtT") against a decision dated 25 April 2019,  being  a  decision  to
    refuse a protection and human rights claim  within  the  context  of  a
    decision to make a deportation order against him in the  light  of  his
    criminal offending. The appeal came before  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Parkes who allowed the appeal on protection grounds.

 3. Permission to appeal the decision of the FtT having been granted to the
    respondent, the appeal came before us. At the hearing before us it  was
    agreed between the parties that the grounds upon  which  permission  to
    appeal was granted were not made out and that there was no error of law
    in the decision of the FtT.

 4. In the circumstances, we are not satisfied that the decision of the FtT
    involved the making of an error on a point of law and its  decision  to
    allow the appeal stands.

 5. Pursuant to rule 40(3)(a) of the Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)
    Rules 2008, no reasons (or further reasons) are required, the  decision
    being made with the consent of the parties.



Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
