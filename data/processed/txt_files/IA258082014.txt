Office
        Presenting Officers) (March and July 2016 respectively)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is the appeal of Andrew [S], a citizen of South Africa  born  31
       October 1997, against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  of  17
       September 2015 dismissing his appeal against the decision of  6  June
       2014 to refuse his application for further leave to remain and to set
       removal directions against him under section 47  of  the  Immigration
       Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.


    2. His argument for remaining in the United Kingdom turns essentially on
       his claim that his return to South  Africa  would  disproportionately
       contravene his private life because of his  strong  links  with  this
       country, having particular regard to the threat posed to his physical
       and moral integrity by the likely deterioration in  his  health  that
       would result from having to live in a warmer country because  of  his
       heart and related conditions.


    3. Before travelling to  the  United  Kingdom  on  the  latest  occasion
       (having lived and worked here for a period  including  2002  to  2004
       when he worked as a personal trainer in Portman Square), he  and  his
       wife had resided in Australia from 2008 to 2011. He was granted leave
       to enter the United  Kingdom  on  10  November  2011  as  his  wife's
       dependent, until 14 November 2014; on 18 April  2014  that  grant  of
       leave was curtailed following him drawing the Respondent's  attention
       to the breakdown of his marriage, which he attributed at least partly
       to the stress caused by awaiting the grant of a visa to come to  this
       country as her dependent: she abandoned him and broke off all contact
       shortly after  his  arrival  here,  his  attempts  at  reconciliation
       failing. On 15 April 2014 he applied for further leave based  on  his
       private life  including  his  medical  condition,  arguing  that  the
       medical evidence showed  that  his  chronic  fatigue  syndrome  would
       deteriorate if he returned to South Africa. I understand that he  was
       previously present in the United Kingdom lawfully with his wife for a
       limited period before November 2011 (hence his ability  to  state  he
       had lived here  for  some  seven  years  at  the  time  he  made  the
       application leading to this appeal).


    4. His application set out that he had  previously  been  a  black  belt
       Judoka competing at national and international levels and was  now  a
       Customer Site Planner for Colt  Technology  Services  by  occupation,
       earning  �70,000;  he  paid  for  his  healthcare  in  this   country
       privately. He and his wife had come to this  country  from  Australia
       for the cooler climate, which he needed for his health  -  conditions
       here had significantly improved his health;  he  had  not  worked  in
       South Africa for 13 years. He was well established  in  this  country
       having lived here for seven  years  and  gained  many  UK  recognised
       certifications; he was involved in the local community via his  local
       church. Supporting evidence included a  letter  from  the  Pastor  of
       Grace Life London stating that he  knew  the  Appellant  well  having
       personally supervised his efforts to re-establish communications with
       his wife. Her loss had been a serious blow to him. He considered  him
       to be a dear friend and a gracious member of  their  church,  as  the
       Appellant had  helped  him  through  painstaking  rehabilitation  for
       almost two years whilst he recovered from back problems, with whom he
       would be very sad to lose contact; he felt the Appellant's  departure
       would represent a personal disaster from him.


    5. That application was refused because he had spent most of his life in
       his home country and any medical care he needed could  be  reasonably
       expected to be available in South Africa.


    6. Evidence put before the First-tier Tribunal included  a  report  from
       Professor Hanna, a  Consultant  Neurologist,  setting  out  that  the
       Appellant had been troubled with  persistent  lethargy,  fatigue  and
       muscular pain since the age  of  21  which  had  ended  his  sporting
       activities, and suffered from intermittent arrhythmias;  he  suffered
       from muscle inflammation. A cardiologist  stated  that  implanting  a
       permanent pacemaker would be a worry in somebody of  the  Appellant's
       age; treatment known as catheter ablation might nevertheless be  used
       in the future, though for now beta blockers would be tried.


    7. Dr Uys, his GP, set out that the Appellant's  health  records  showed
       that he had been admitted  to  hospital  in  South  Africa  on  seven
       occasions for serious exhaustion, and that subsequently his  symptoms
       had  greatly  improved  after  coming  to  the  United  Kingdom;  his
       condition was fragile and could deteriorate under stress or  his  and
       normal life suffered disruption. Warm weather would sap  his  energy;
       when he suffered stress and  anxiety  his  symptoms  would  increase,
       including his underlying heart disrhythmia. Changes to  his  work  or
       life schedule would have a significant impact on his health as  would
       sudden changes in climate. Cardiologist Dr Thornton  wrote  that  the
       Appellant had been in an emergency room approximately four  times  in
       the six months leading up to his report in April 2010:  his  symptoms
       included  nausea,  muscle  weakness,  breathlessness,  dizziness  and
       feeling that his heart was racing; an examination  revealed  abnormal
       heart function that was  the  subject  of  ongoing  investigation.  A
       letter from a  doctor  based  in  Perth,  Australia,  of  March  2010
       discussed  potential  diagnoses  and  confirmed  the   longevity   of
       investigations into his health.


    8. A reference from Technical Resources Ltd set out that he  had  worked
       for several of their largest clients and shown pride in his work, and
       was held in the highest regard by his colleagues, and was responsible
       for various  voice  and  data  projects,  showing  tremendous  skill,
       ability and dedication to his work.


    9. The  Judge  accepted  the  Appellant's  evidence  generally.  It  was
       established that his earnings were some �70,000 annually. The climate
       here was likely to be more conducive to the Appellant's  health,  and
       he would be better able to work here where conditions  were  flexible
       due to his self-employed status, though there was no evidence  before
       the First-tier Tribunal  to  show  that  the  equipment  and  systems
       involved in his professional activities were  more  complex  in  this
       country than in South Africa such as to render his recent  experience
       useless there. Whilst  it  was  likely  that  he  would  suffer  some
       disadvantage from the positive  discrimination  provisions  governing
       the home labour market there was nothing to  show  that  these  would
       operate significantly to his disadvantage. He could  be  expected  to
       integrate back in South Africa where he had been brought up,  and  to
       find  employment,  albeit  that  his   health   would   represent   a
       disadvantage to his return there.


   10. He could not continue  his  work  for  his  present  employer,  Colt,
       without face-to-face contact with the firm's clients in this country,
       though there was the prospect of being employed at a  lower  wage  in
       the future. His claim did not reach the high threshold for an article
       3 breach identified in N v United  Kingdom  2008  47  EHRR  885,  and
       whilst he would face hardship on a  return  to  South  Africa,  there
       would be no unjustifiably harsh consequences. He had not  established
       that he would have qualified for a Tier 2 visa to  return  here.  The
       right to be paid at the market  rate  or  to  receive  more  flexible
       working conditions was not something found within Article 8 ECHR.  It
       was not satisfied that the Appellant would be unable  to  secure  his
       return to this country under the  Immigration  Rules  or  to  another
       territory where the climate would be suited to the management of  his
       condition. Accordingly the appeal was dismissed.


   11. The First-tier Tribunal regretted this conclusion as it was satisfied
       that the Appellant  was  an  honest  witness  with  very  substantial
       skills, experience and ability in his  chosen  field,  and  that  the
       United Kingdom would lose the ability to benefit from his skills  and
       experience  if  he  found  appropriately  remunerated  employment  in
       another country; our loss, which we might well be able to ill afford,
       would be their gain. In the course  of  determining  the  appeal  the
       judge permitted further evidence to be provided,  which  showed  that
       Colt held a Tier 2 General Licence and that if he was shortlisted for
       employment by  them,  it  would  issue  him  with  a  Certificate  of
       Sponsorship, in which case he could leave the country  and  apply  to
       return here, and that advertisements had been put out for a  Customer
       Site Planner earning �30-35k which had been filled via  the  domestic
       labour market. As I read the decision below,  the  Judge  interpreted
       this material as showing that a future application  might  be  viable
       for the Appellant as a means by which he could extend  his  residence
       here as a sponsored worker, which was  then  taken  to  be  a  factor
       counting against his claim that the present immigration decision  was
       a disproportionate one.


   12. Grounds of appeal contended that  the  judge  had  failed  to  attach
       appropriate weight to the compelling and exceptional circumstances of
       the case bearing in mind his length of residence and  the  impact  it
       had on his personal autonomy, physical and moral  integrity  and  the
       development of his personality and relationship with  others,  unduly
       focussing on the high threshold regarding Article 3 health cases;  it
       had failed to address his private life connections  with  the  United
       Kingdom where he had lived for 12 years.


   13. The First-tier Tribunal granted permission to appeal on  10  February
       2016 because the Judge had arguably failed to  take  account  of  the
       Appellant's inability to cope with his country of  origin's  climate,
       the impact of his ability to qualify under the Immigration  Rules  on
       Tier 2 general workers, and the contribution that he  might  make  to
       the economy of this country which might otherwise be lost.


   14. In a response of 29 February 2016 the Secretary of  State  maintained
       that the First-tier Tribunal had properly considered the case  making
       appropriate findings based on the available evidence.


Findings and reasons - Error of law hearing

   15. Given the Appellant's links  with  South  Africa  which  include  the
       presence of close family members, it would be  difficult  to  imagine
       that he could not integrate there on a return. Accordingly  any  case
       under the Immigration Rules would be very difficult to  advance,  and
       the critical question on  the  appeal  was  essentially  whether  the
       circumstances were 'compelling' such  as  to  produce  'unjustifiably
       harsh consequences' so as to outweigh the  public  interest",  having
       regard to principles of proportionality bearing in mind  that  Aikens
       LJ in MM & Ors [2014] EWCA Civ 985 stated that "in any event it would
       be necessary to apply a 'proportionality test'  with  regard  to  the
       'exceptional circumstances' guidance in order to be  compatible  with
       the Convention and in compliance with Huang at [20]." As it  was  put
       in SS (Congo) & Ors [2015] EWCA Civ 387, "it is accurate to say  that
       the general position ... is that compelling circumstances would  need
       to be identified to support a claim for grant of LTR outside the  new
       Rules".


   16. Article 8 protects, as shown by Bensaid  v  United  Kingdom  44599/98
       [2001] ECHR 82, aspects of identity and personal development, and the
       right to establish and develop relationships with other human  beings
       and the outside world, and "imposes on States a  positive  obligation
       to secure to their citizens the right to effective respect for  their
       physical and psychological integrity": see eg the  Grand  Chamber  of
       the European Court of Human Rights in Hamalainen v Finland - 37359/09
       [2014] ECHR 787 at [63].  Underhill LJ in GS (India) [2015] EWCA  Civ
       40  at  [109]  wrote  that  "In  the  mental  health  cases  ...  the
       preservation of mental stability is ... an indispensable precondition
       to effective enjoyment of the right to respect for private life"  see
       ... Bensaid, adopted in Razgar ... More  particularly,  the  thinking
       appears to be that  mental  stability  is  "integral  to  a  person's
       identity or ability to function socially as  a  person"."  Clearly  a
       significant deterioration in one's physical health  could  compromise
       one's physical and psychological integrity in the same way, rendering
       participation in normal society impossible.


   17. It seemed to me that the  First-tier  Tribunal  lost  sight  of  this
       dimension of the protected rights in play in this case. It discounted
       the medical evidence which strongly suggested that the  stress  of  a
       move to South  Africa  would  seriously  compromise  the  Appellant's
       health without giving  reasons  for  so  doing.  Whilst  it  examined
       whether the Appellant could work in South Africa, it failed  to  take
       account of his diminished prospects of so  doing  having  suffered  a
       foreseeable deterioration in his health. Furthermore,  it  speculated
       as to whether the Appellant could secure  entry  to  another  country
       where the climate might be amenable to his health without having  any
       evidence before it to such effect. It is clear that his physical  and
       psychological  integrity  might  well   be   compromised   by   these
       considerations.


   18. Furthermore, given  its  findings  as  to  the  potential  value  the
       Appellant represented to the domestic economy, it was wrong  to treat
       those simply as matters to be regretted that were extraneous  to  the
       question of law before it: the contribution that a migrant  has  made
       to the community in the UK may be relevant to the assessment  of  the
       public interest in their removal, see eg the  old  case  of  Bakhtaur
       Singh [1986] 1 WLR 910 where the House of Lords found that the  value
       to the community in the United Kingdom of the individual in  question
       was relevant to the assessment of the public interest. Lord Bridge of
       Harwich, who gave the only reasoned judgment, referred at page 917C-E
       to a number of examples of persons with such value  and  specifically
       considered "a social worker upon whom a local community depended"  as
       the kind of case where the public interest would not require removal.
       In UE (Nigeria) [2010] EWCA Civ 975 Ward LJ stated at [18] that there
       is a public interest in the retention in this country of someone  who
       is of considerable value to the community which goes to the weight to
       be attached to the public interest in the proportionality exercise.


   19. Finally,  the  First-tier  Tribunal  appeared  to  misunderstand  the
       relevance of the material put forward following the hearing, which it
       requested and then entertained, as  to  the  Appellant's  ability  to
       return to the United Kingdom under the Tier 2 category. The thrust of
       that evidence was that the nature of the Appellant's  working  regime
       was not something amenable to a tenable application under the  Rules,
       because any equivalent role could be satisfied by the domestic labour
       market.


   20. I accordingly found that the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
       contained material errors of law  and  the  legal  reasoning  therein
       should be set aside. The findings of fact were otherwise unchallenged
       and could accordingly stand, and I directed a continuation hearing in
       the Upper Tribunal.


Proceedings at the continuation hearing


   21. At the re-hearing of the   further  evidence  was  filed  and  served
       comprising a statement by the Appellant's brother, Shaun [S], setting
       out that his chronic health condition meant  that  the  UK's  climate
       represented a favourable environment which could be  relied  upon  to
       keep him in a stable and sustainable condition. He would be unable to
       accommodate him on a return  due  to  personal  circumstances.  Their
       mother was elderly and was still in work, earning  the  minimum  age,
       living in a small apartment with her sister, their aunt.  There  were
       further difficulties caused by a white male facing  problems  because
       the bulk of available jobs fall within the Black Empowerment Act.  He
       feared that on a return to South Africa he would rapidly  deteriorate
       and fall into a serious condition. Andrew  has  been  historically  a
       very good hearted inspiration to him and believed him to be a man  of
       character and integrity.


   22. Dr Uys wrote on 7 July 2016 that he continued to treat the  Appellant
       for heart rhythm disturbances. Though  his  condition  was  presently
       stable, any  significant  change  in  his  lifestyle  might  cause  a
       deterioration of his condition and so should be avoided.


   23. The Appellant gave evidence. He said that  he  had  family  in  South
       Africa by way of a brother who worked as a judo coach and  who  lived
       from day to day financially; his mother and aunt also lived there. He
       had never received NHS treatment in  this  country.   His  work  here
       consisted  of   providing   clients   with   technological   support,
       particularly wavelength technology, and their ongoing  service  needs
       and requirements. There was no equivalent work available  to  him  in
       South Africa because the technologies there  were  far  behind  those
       available in the United Kingdom, the equipment was very expensive and
       they  used  a  different  information  technology   platform   there.
       Furthermore the race discrimination legislation in force there  would
       prevent a person of his ethnicity from obtaining employment.


   24. Besides that, his health condition made it unfeasible to work  there,
       he would inevitably have to disclose  the  fragility  of  his  health
       given his medical condition and he would then be  overlooked  in  the
       labour market.  His  present  employers  were  aware  of  his  health
       condition  and  accordingly  gave  him  flexibility  in  his  working
       arrangements. He could be productive here, managing his  life  around
       working from home so that he could always rest if  he  found  himself
       struggling in the course of the working day. In South Africa he would
       have to travel long distances and there would be  no  possibility  of
       working at home and he would have to go to an office.


   25. Cross examined, he said that he left South Africa aged  24.  At  that
       time he had been  working  with  his  mother  in  her  window  blinds
       business.  He had no evidence that there were no temperate climes  in
       South Africa where the weather conditions would not be a bar  to  his
       effective participation in  the  labour  market.  He  had  no  formal
       evidence regarding race discrimination in his  industry,  or  of  the
       work that was available  there.  He  had  not  retained  any  medical
       evidence vis-�-vis the available treatment for  people  like  him  in
       South Africa who could not work.


   26. Even if he worked at sea level or somewhere cooler in  South  Africa,
       his health would deteriorate quickly, when he was  there  for  a  few
       months in 2010 waiting for his ex-wife's paperwork to  come  through,
       he was quickly reduced to being confined to hospital on  a  drip.  He
       was very unstable at that time, people around him were  worried  that
       he was slipping back to the state that had left him in intensive care
       in 2009: even with the benefit  of  air-conditioning  he  was  mostly
       confined to bed, only  occasionally  being  able  to  stand  up.  His
       sinoatrial  node  was  defective  leaving  him  with   an   irregular
       heartbeat. The doctor told him that whilst  in  theory  he  might  be
       cured via an operation, ongoing medication  was  better  because  the
       operation would have only a 50% chance of success, and if  it  failed
       he would need a pacemaker fitted.


   27. For the Secretary of State Mr Bramble submitted that this was at base
       a medical case to which the notoriously high threshold in N v  United
       Kingdom 2008 47 EHRR 885 applied, given the limited connections  that
       the Appellant had with the United Kingdom. Although his  claim  might
       fall to be approached  via  the  prism  of  the  physical  and  moral
       integrity aspect of Article 8 of the ECHR, it was still  relevant  to
       posit the question whether he would face  imminent  death  on  return
       without family care. There were  significant  gaps  in  the  evidence
       needed to show that the  climate  in  South  Africa  was  universally
       unsuitable for him and as to the  availability  of  treatment  there.
       Whilst he might have friendships here, he had not had many  years  of
       consistent residence, and he was  not  a  community  leader  or  role
       model. The fact he might be self-sufficient  should  be  afforded  no
       positive weight in the balancing exercise, and he could always  apply
       to return to the United Kingdom  if  he  could  identify  a  suitable
       immigration route.


   28. For the Appellant Mr Chohan pointed to the severity of  his  client's
       ill health problems as documented by  the  various  medical  reports.
       They were greatly stabilised by the temperate climate  here,  and  he
       could not be said to be a health tourist given that he  did  not  use
       the NHS. Here he could sustain his  career  by  working  through  the
       night using advanced technologies. He had had consistent support from
       his friends in this country whereas  in  South  Africa  he  would  be
       thrown onto the support of his aged  relatives,  and  any  employment
       would involve a significant amount of runaround.


Findings and reasons - Continuation hearing


Appeal against Refusal of Leave to Remain on Private Life Grounds


   29. The appeal must first be considered  against  the  benchmark  of  the
       Immigration Rules, which materially set out:


           "Requirements to be met by an applicant for leave to remain on
           the grounds of private life
           276ADE. The requirements to be met by an applicant for leave to
           remain on the grounds of private life in the UK are that at the
           date of application, the applicant:
           (i) does not fall for refusal under any of the grounds in
           Section S-LTR 1.2 to S-LTR 2.3. and S-LTR.3.1. in Appendix FM;
           and
           ...
           (iii) has lived continuously in the UK for at least 20 years
           (discounting any period of imprisonment); or
           ...
           (vi) is aged 18 years or above, has lived continuously in the UK
           for less than 20 years (discounting any period of imprisonment)
           but there would be very significant obstacles to the applicant's
           integration into the country to which he would have to go if
           required to leave the UK."


   30. The Appellant has not lived in the United Kingdom for  more  than  20
       years, so the relevant question is whether he could  integrate  on  a
       return to South Africa. He continues to have family there,  and  many
       of his friends in this country are in any event from  the  expatriate
       community.  Plainly there will be no  difficulties  in  speaking  the
       relevant language. He would doubtless be able to find  some  kind  of
       work on return even if  not  well-suited  to  his  health  condition.
       Whatever problems he would have, they could not reasonably be defined
       as inconsistent with his reintegration in his country of origin. I do
       not therefore accept that he can satisfy Rule 276ADE.


Private and Family Life outside the Rules


   31. I have already set out the relevant authorities relating  to  private
       life in the sense of the protection afforded to  one's  physical  and
       moral integrity. In determining the appeal,  I  have  regard  to  the
       decisions in Nagre [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin) and  Gulshan  [2013]  UKUT
       640, as confirmed by Shahzad (Art 8: legitimate aim) [2014]  UKUT  85
       (IAC). As a convenient summary direction, I shall adopt the  approach
       proposed by Judge Grubb in Aliyu & Anor [2014] EWHC 3919  (Admin)  at
       [65],  ie  I   shall   assess   whether   there   are   "'exceptional
       circumstances' applying the criterion of  whether  the  circumstances
       were  'compelling'  such   as   to   produce   'unjustifiably   harsh
       consequences' so as to outweigh the public interest",  albeit  having
       regard to principles of proportionality bearing in mind  that  Aikens
       LJ in MM & Ors [2014] EWCA Civ 985 stated that "in any event it would
       be necessary to apply a 'proportionality test'  with  regard  to  the
       'exceptional circumstances' guidance in order to be  compatible  with
       the Convention and in compliance with Huang at [20]."


   32. In the wider context of the Human Rights Convention  and  Article  8
       ECHR, bearing in mind the well-established principles in R  (Razgar)
       (2004) UKHL 27,  it  cannot  be  disputed  that  the  Appellant  has
       established a private life here, based upon his length of time spent
       working in the United Kingdom (which includes a  significant  period
       prior to his latest arrival in 2011)  during  which  period  he  has
       established numerous friendships and a professional career  and  has
       become very involved with his local church (understandably given the
       loss  of  his  wife  and  his  health  problems).  Given  the  stark
       difference between life here and his health condition when  he  last
       lived in South Africa, his removal as a consequence of the  decision
       to refuse his application would interfere  with  his  private  life.
       Article 8 is engaged.  The Respondent's decision  is  in  accordance
       with the law and pursues a legitimate aim, i.e. the  economic  well-
       being of the country in terms of immigration control.


   33. That leaves proportionality,  the  assessment  of  which  must  take
       account of certain statutory factors in so far as they are  relevant
       to the considerations in play in this case.


         "PART 5A
         Article 8 of the ECHR: public interest considerations ...
         117B Article 8: public interest considerations  applicable  in  all
         cases
         (1)      The maintenance of effective immigration  controls  is  in
         the public interest.
         (2)      It is in the public interest, and  in  particular  in  the
         interests of the economic well-being of the  United  Kingdom,  that
         persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom are  able
         to speak English, because persons who can speak English-
             (a) are less of a burden on taxpayers, and
             (b) are better able to integrate into society.
         (3)      It is in the public interest, and  in  particular  in  the
             interests of the economic well-being of  the  United  Kingdom,
             that persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom
             are financially independent, because such persons-
         (a)      are not a burden on taxpayers, and
         (b)      are better able to integrate into society.
         (4)      Little weight should be given to-
             (a) a private life, or
             (b) a relationship formed with a qualifying partner,
                 that is established by a person at a time when the  person
             is in the United Kingdom unlawfully.
         5) Little weight should be given to a private life established by a
            person at  a  time  when  the  person's  immigration  status  is
            precarious."


   34. Mr [S] undoubtedly finds himself in a  difficult  situation,  having
       come to the United Kingdom originally as  the  spouse  of  a  person
       working here; he has, since the failure of that relationship, sought
       to make a life for himself here as  best  he  can  in  the  face  of
       serious health difficulties, albeit ones which  he  has  managed  to
       control successfully, extensively assisted by a sympathetic employer
       in the United Kingdom. Although the Secretary of State  has  treated
       this appeal as if it was a classic "health" case which requires  the
       establishing of a very high threshold before it has  any  chance  of
       succeeding, I do not consider that is correct. The Appellant is  not
       claiming that there is any material difference of medical  treatment
       between that available in the United Kingdom and  in  South  Africa.
       Rather  his  argument  is  that  he  does  not  require  significant
       healthcare whilst living in the United Kingdom where  the  temperate
       climate is conducive to his health,  whereas  in  South  Africa  his
       circumstances would speedily deteriorate.  Moses  LJ  stated  in  MM
       (Zimbabwe) [2012] EWCA Civ 279 �23:


           "The only cases I can foresee where the absence of adequate
           medical treatment in the country to which a person is to be
           deported will be relevant to Article 8, is where it is an
           additional factor to be weighed in the balance, with other
           factors which by themselves engage Article 8. Suppose, in this
           case, the appellant had established firm family ties in this
           country, then the availability of continuing medical treatment
           here, coupled with his dependence on the family here for
           support, together establish 'private life' under Article 8. That
           conclusion would not involve a comparison between medical
           facilities here and those in Zimbabwe. Such a finding would not
           offend the principle expressed above that the United Kingdom is
           under no Convention obligation to provide medical treatment here
           when it is not available in the country to which the appellant
           is to be deported."


   35. As I have just indicated, this case is even  more  remote  from  the
       pure health paradigm than the situation before the Court  of  Appeal
       in MM, given that the Appellant is not facing a  documented  absence
       of healthcare in South Africa. The deterioration in his health  that
       he would face on a return there is amenable to be considered as part
       of the overall circumstances relevant to his private life  including
       his physical and moral integrity.


   36. I accept that the Appellant would face, on balance of probabilities,
       given the medical evidence I have cited above which includes express
       opinion evidence that a return to  a  significantly  hotter  climate
       would damage his ongoing remission from the worst of his symptoms, a
       very significant diminution in his health if he  returned  to  South
       Africa. It seems clear that he was unable to ameliorate the problems
       from which he suffered on his last trip there in 2010 by  relocating
       within the country: had he  been  able  to  find  suitable  climatic
       conditions then surely he would have done so, rather than remain bed
       bound for a significant period. This is the critical feature of  his
       case.


   37. Beyond the probable stark difference in his health in  this  country
       and in South Africa, he does have very strong connections  with  the
       United Kingdom, the country  in  which  he  understandably  saw  his
       future when he arrived on the  last  occasion:  these  comprise  his
       unusually precisely tailored working arrangements, his close ties to
       his church, and the various friendships he has established here, all
       of which have been enhanced by their development over a period where
       his most significant relationship was failing and during  which  his
       own health was in a very uncertain state.


   38.  As  to  the  section  117B  factors,  he  is  clearly   financially
       independent, earning significant  sums  in  ongoing  employment.  He
       speaks fluent English. He was not, of course, guaranteed  the  grant
       of indefinite leave to remain if  his  circumstances  changed  post-
       arrival, as sadly they did when the breakdown of his marriage led to
       his inability to complete the  settlement  route  on  which  he  had
       entered the country. I note that Sales LJ in  Rhuppiah  [2016]  EWCA
       Civ 803 �44  stated that it was doubtful that it  was  correct  that
       any grant of limited leave to enter or remain short of ILR qualifies
       as "precarious" for the purposes of section 117B(5). It seems to me,
       taking  the  evaluative  approach  that  Sales  LJ   indicated   was
       appropriate, that the Appellant's leave, whilst limited  in  nature,
       was of a kind which was at the less precarious end of the scale.


   39. I accordingly find that this is one of those relatively  rare  cases
       where there are particularly compelling circumstances such that  the
       immigration decision is disproportionate to  the  interference  with
       the Appellant's private life that it entails.  The  appeal  must  be
       allowed.
