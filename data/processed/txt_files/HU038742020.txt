                          DECISION AND REASONS (V)



For the appellant:     Mr N Shah, instructed by NorthWest Solicitors

For the Respondent:    Mr A McVeety, Senior Presenting Officer



This  has  been  a  remote  hearing  which  has   been   consented   to by
the parties. The form of remote hearing was video by Skype (V). A face-to-
face hearing was not held because it was not  practicable,  and  all  issues
could be determined in a remote hearing. At the conclusion of  the  hearing,
I indicated my decision but reserved my full reasons, which I now give.  The
order made is described at the end of these reasons.

1. The appellant, who is an Afghan national with  date  of  birth  given  as
   9.4.80, has appealed with permission to the Upper  Tribunal  against  the
   decision of the First-tier Tribunal promulgated 5.1.21  (Judge  Haidary),
   dismissing on  all  grounds  her  appeal  against  the  decision  of  the
   Secretary of State, dated 27.2.20, to  refuse  her  application  made  on
   25.11.19 for leave to remain  in  the  UK  on  family  and  private  life
   grounds.

2. Permission to appeal was granted by Resident  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
   Zucker on 1.2.21, considering it arguable  that  the  judge  misconstrued
   section 3C and paragraph 39E of the Immigration Rules,  had  gone  behind
   the respondent's concession regarding the  financial  requirements  under
   the Rules, and made a flawed proportionality assessment.

3. The Upper Tribunal has received the respondent's  Rule  24  reply,  dated
   5.2.21, and the appellant's skeleton argument, dated 27.5.21.

4. I have carefully considered the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  in
   the  light  of  the  submissions  and  the  grounds  of  application  for
   permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.

5. The first ground in the application to the Upper  Tribunal  is  that  the
   judge misconceived the application of paragraph 39E  of  the  Immigration
   Rules. The respondent's position as set out in the refusal  decision  was
   that the appellant could not meet the immigration status requirements  of
   the Rules as she had remained in the UK beyond valid leave to remain.  In
   the grounds of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal, the appellant  did  not
   accept that she had overstayed. However, on her  representative's  advice
   that ground was withdrawn, and at the First-tier Tribunal appeal  hearing
   both parties agreed that she had overstayed. However, the judge  did  not
   accept this.

6. I am satisfied that the judge was in error of law in finding at  [27]  of
   the decision that the appellant's leave expired on 11.12.19, the date  28
   days following my refusal of permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal.
   As Mr McVeety pointed out and with which Mr Shah agreed, the  failure  to
   pursue my  refusal  further  to  the  Court  of  Appeal  meant  that  the
   appellant's 3C leave in fact expired on 13.11.19, the date of sending  of
   the decision refusing permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal.

7. At [28] of the impugned decision, the judge appears  to  have  considered
   that paragraph 39E applied but failed to realise that  39E  only  applies
   where leave has expired, so that on the judge's findings that  leave  had
   not expired by the date of the most recent application made on  25.11.19,
   paragraph 39E should not have come into consideration.

8. Whilst the judge has made multiple errors in relation to s3C and 39E,  it
   seems that 39E does in fact apply. I raised with both Mr McVeety  and  Mr
   Shah that if the appellant's 3C leave extended to 13.11.19, the  date  of
   my refusal of permission to appeal to  the  Court  of  Appeal,  then  the
   appellant's next application made on 25.11.19 was within the 14-day limit
   and, therefore, the period of overstaying should have  been  disregarded.
   This is not addressed in the respondent's refusal decision, nor the  Rule
   24 Reply, nor Mr Shah's further skeleton argument of 27.5.21.

9. After due consideration, both Mr Shah and Mr McVeety  accepted  that  39E
   applied so that the period of overstaying beyond  13.11.19  to  her  next
   application on 25.11.19 should have been disregarded  by  the  respondent
   when considering her application for leave to remain within the Rules.

10. Regarding the judge's digression  into  the  financial  requirements  of
   Appendix FM, Mr McVeety accepted that this was not an issue raised in the
   refusal decision. He also accepted that it was not a point  of  challenge
   by the Home Office  representative  at  the  First-tier  Tribunal  appeal
   hearing. Both parties also agreed that the judge appears to have confused
   the 2018 application, in respect  of  which  it  was  conceded  that  the
   documentation failed to meet the evidential requirements of Appendix  FM-
   SE, with  the  2019  application  in  respect  of  which  the  evidential
   requirements were met, the documentation being in the appellant's bundle.
   The judge was in error to suggest that the appellant's skeleton  argument
   submitted that the threshold of ï¿½18,600 was met but  that  the  appellant
   "could not provide the specified evidence to substantiate such earnings."
   That related to the 2018 and not the 2019 application.  It  follows  that
   the financial requirements were not in issue and the judge was  in  error
   to consider them so.

11. Although the judge erred in relation  to  3C,  39E,  and  the  financial
   requirements, the Rule 24 reply submits that these findings  were  wholly
   immaterial to the outcome of the appeal as the  appellant  accepted  that
   the claim had to be resolved outside  of  the  Rules.  Despite  that,  Mr
   McVeety accepted, for the reasons  set  out  above,  that  the  appellant
   should have had the benefit of 39E so that the  application  should  have
   succeeded under the Rules.

12. Although this  is  a  human  rights  appeal,  and  despite  the  various
   assertions  and  concessions  made  at  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  I  am
   satisfied that 39E did apply, although for different reasons  than  found
   by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge,  with  the  consequence  that   the
   application should have been granted and in a  human  rights  appeal  the
   public interest in the article 8 ECHR proportionality balancing  exercise
   is and should be deemed to be satisfied,  so  that  the  appeal  must  be
   allowed.

13. In the circumstances and for the reasons set  out  above,  I  find  such
   material error of law in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal so  that
   it must be set aside and remade by allowing the appeal.

Decision

      The appeal of the appellant to the Upper Tribunal is allowed.

      The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside.

      I remake the decision in the appeal by allowing  it  on  human  rights
      grounds pursuant to article 8 ECHR.

      I make no order for costs.

      I make no anonymity direction.
