                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The Appellant is a citizen  of  Indonesia.   She  appeals  against  the
    decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge S  Gillespie  promulgated  on  17
    July 2019 dismissing her appeal against the refusal of a residence card
    under Regulation 9 of the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2016.

2.   Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Grubb  on  the
    ground that the judge failed to adopt the approach in  ZA  (Reg  9  EEA
    Regs; abuse of rights) Afghanistan [2019]  UKUT  281  (IAC)  which  was
    reported after his decision. Further, if Regulation 9(4) was relied on,
    the burden was on the Respondent.

3.   The matter came before  me  on  11  November  2019  and  was  adjourned
    pending the appeal of SZ,  which  raised  similar  issues  to  ZA.  The
    Appellant did not attend and directions were given for  her  to  submit
    further  evidence  because,  at  the  hearing  before  the   First-tier
    Tribunal,  the  Respondent's  bundle  did  not  contain  the  documents
    submitted with the Appellant's application.

4.   At the hearing today,  the  Appellant  did  not  attend  but  submitted
    evidence of her husband's employment with HSBC from 6 February 2017  to
    12 June 2017 and Premier Restaurant from 24 January 2017 to 28 February
    2017.  No evidence was submitted by the Respondent.

5.   The Appellant has  submitted  cogent  evidence  that  her  husband  was
    exercising Treaty rights in Malta. Had this evidence  been  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge he may have come to a  different  conclusion.
    Although the judge cannot  be  criticised  for  failing  to  take  into
    account evidence which was not before him, there has been a  procedural
    irregularity which gives rise to an error of law. There was no fault on
    the part of  the  Appellant  that  the  documents  submitted  with  the
    application were not in the Respondent's bundle or on the  court  file.
    Accordingly, I find that there has been a material error of law in  the
    decision of 17 July 2019 and I set the decision aside.   I  remake  the
    decision as follows:

6.   Having considered  the  written  evidence  of  the  Appellant  and  the
    documents in support of her application, I find that the Appellant  and
    her family lived in Malta between 16 December 2016 and  24  July  2017.
    Her husband worked part-time for a restaurant in January  and  February
    2017 and was employed full-time by HSBC from  6  February  to  12  July
    2017. Applying ZA Afghanistan, I find that the Appellant has shown that
    the exercise of Treaty rights in the host member state was genuine  and
    effective. On the evidence before me, the Respondent has failed to show
    that there was an abuse of rights. Accordingly, I allow the Appellant's
    appeal under Regulation 9 of the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2016.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a fee award and have decided to make  a  fee  award
of any fee which has been paid or may be payable.
