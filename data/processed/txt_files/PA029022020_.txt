                                   Between

                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                            DECISION AND REMITTAL

 1. On 21 June 2021 I wrote to the parties as follows:

         "In a response submitted under rule 24 the Secretary of  State,  by
         Mr Bates, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer, has  proposed  the
         setting aside of the decision of Judge O'Hagan and the remittal for
         the appeal to be heard afresh in the First-tier Tribunal.

         The reason for that proposal appears to me to be sound.  It is that
         the implausibility referred to by the judge in  paragraphs  [35]  -
         [36] seems to form part of his reasoning; but the fact asserted  is
         not implausible.  I agree.

         I propose without more ado to  set  aside  the  decision  of  Judge
         O'Hagan for error of law and remit the appeal for a  new  decision.
         Any submissions to the contrary  will  be  considered  if  received
         within 14 days of the date of this letter."

 2. No reply has been received.

 3. I now set aside the decision of Judge O'Hagan  for  error  of  law  and
    remit the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal for decision afresh.

                                                           C. M. G. OCKELTON
                                        VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UPPER TRIBUNAL
                                              IMMIGRATION AND ASYLUM CHAMBER
                                                          Date: 22 July 2021
