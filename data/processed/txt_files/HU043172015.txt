Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr N Ahmed instructed by Peer & Co (Watford)
For the Respondent:    Mr L Tarlow, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant is a national of Gambia.  She appealed to  the  Judge  of
    the First-tier Tribunal against the Entry Clearance Officer's  decision
    of 14 July 2015 refusing entry clearance to  enable  her  to  join  her
    mother, Ms Sarjo Joof, in the United Kingdom.

2.   The respondent was  not  satisfied  that  the  application  was  for  a
    purpose covered by the Immigration Rules and refused it under paragraph
    320(1) of HC 395.  The appellant was born on 4 February  1998  and  was
    under 18 years at the time of the application on 29  April  2015.   The
    judge  accepted  the  genuineness  of  the  relationship  between   the
    appellant and Ms Joof and was also  satisfied  that  there  was  family
    life.  He noted that there had been visits over a period of three years
    and photographs and copies of phone  messages  and  he  concluded  that
    there was emotional dependence as well as financial dependence.

3.   As regards the issue of proportionality, the judge  bore  in  mind  the
    provisions of section 117B of HC 395 and  noted  that  a  significantly
    weighty issue within the proportionality  assessment  was  whether  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules were met.  He noted the terms  of
    paragraph 297 of HC 395 and having said at paragraph 24  that  Counsel,
    Mr Ahmed, had accepted there was  no  "sole  responsibility"  argument,
    went on to consider whether there were serious and compelling family or
    other considerations which made the appellant's exclusion  undesirable.
    The judge noted that the  appellant  was  not  living  in  satisfactory
    conditions  with  her  extended  family.   She  had  not  been   abused
    physically but she felt left out of things.  She had little privacy and
    was possibly experiencing bullying.   However,  she  had  a  home  with
    people she knew and had access to money  regularly  and  was  accessing
    education.  As a consequence the judge concluded that it was not  shown
    that she  was  living  in  circumstances  which  were  so  serious  and
    compelling as to make her  exclusion  undesirable.   Referring  to  the
    guidance in  Mundeba  [2013]  UKUT  88  (IAC)  he  concluded  that  the
    requirements of the Rules were not met.  This weighed  heavily  against
    the appellant.  The judge bore in mind the appellant's half-brother but
    considered in reality the age difference was such that they  would  not
    grow up together as siblings.  In conclusion  he  considered  that  the
    decision was not disproportionate and that Ms Joof and her  husband  Mr
    Silk continue to send money and make visits  as  they  had  done  since
    2013.  The appeal was therefore dismissed.

4.   Perhaps I need say relatively little about the  grounds  of  appeal  as
    before the First-tier  Judge  who  granted  permission,  and  also  the
    submissions made by Mr Ahmed on behalf of the appellant since Mr Tarlow
    very fairly and properly took no issue with the points that  were  made
    and accepted that there were errors of law in the judge's decision.  It
    was relevant to note also at this point  that  most  unfortunately  the
    appellant was in a road traffic accident in Gambia on 14  October  2017
    and suffered what appear from the evidence that has been provided to me
    to be serious injuries.  In the circumstances Mr  Ahmed  expressed  the
    hope that a speedy  decision  could  be  provided,  given  the  extreme
    worries and anxiety of the family at present.  I was not in a  position
    to do so at the hearing, but this  decision  is  provided  as  soon  as
    reasonably could be done after the hearing.

5.   Mr Ahmed's main challenges to the decision which  clearly  need  to  be
    borne in mind in the remaking of it, are first that the judge  did  not
    deal with the issue  of  sole  responsibility,  noting  as  he  did  at
    paragraph 24 there was no "sole  responsibility"  argument.   Mr  Ahmed
    denied that any such concession had been made and said  that  the  only
    concession that had been made was with reference to the  appellant  not
    being able to  satisfy  paragraph  297(i)(e)  on  the  basis  that  the
    appellant's mother was not present and settled in the United Kingdom.

6.   Though I have been unable to locate the skeleton argument to which  the
    judge referred in paragraph 24, I  note  from  Sarjo  Joof's  statement
    before the judge at paragraph 2 that she had  sole  responsibility  for
    the appellant.  It would be  surprising  indeed  if  Mr  Ahmed  in  his
    skeleton argument had gone against that clear piece  of  evidence,  and
    accordingly I accept that there was a confusion and the concession  was
    only with regard to paragraph 297(i)(e).

7.   This feeds in to Mr Ahmed's argument  that  the  judge's  decision  was
    flawed by failure to make proper findings on relevant issues under  the
    Immigration Rules  which  were  of  relevance  to  the  proportionality
    assessment.

8.   Mr Ahmed also argued that this was of relevance to the point ruled  out
    by the judge who granted permission, in  concluding  that  it  was  not
    arguable that the judge erred in law in finding there were not  serious
    and compelling reasons making the  appellant's  exclusion  undesirable.
    He  argued  that  in  the  absence  of  a  proper   finding   on   sole
    responsibility that finding was inevitably flawed.  Again, I agree with
    Mr Ahmed's submission.  It seems to me  that  a  proper  evaluation  of
    proportionality has to take account of all  the  relevant  elements  of
    paragraph 297 and that there may  be  implications  for  a  finding  in
    respect of paragraph 297(i)(f) where there has been a failure to making
    a finding on an element of (e).

9.   A further point concerns what was said by the Upper Tribunal in SF  and
    others [2017] UKUT 00120 (IAC), which is summarised in the head note as
    follows:

         "Even in the absence of a 'not in accordance with the  law'  ground
         of appeal, the Tribunal ought to  take  the  Secretary  of  State's
         guidance into account if it points clearly to a particular  outcome
         in the instant case.  Only in that way can consistency be  obtained
         between those cases that do, and those  cases  that  do  not,  come
         before the Tribunal."

10.  Mr  Ahmed  argued  in  that  regard  that  this  was  relevant  to  the
    reasonableness of return of a British citizen child in the  context  of
    Article 8.  Home Office policy was that it would not be  reasonable  to
    expect a British citizen child to leave the United Kingdom and that was
    exactly the situation as at the date of hearing and  it  had  not  been
    considered by the judge.  It should be questioned how family life could
    be continued outside the United Kingdom if it was unreasonable and this
    was a factor of fundamental significance which had not been considered.



11.  There were also public  interest  considerations.   Though  these  were
    mainly neutral there was the question of  the  best  interests  of  the
    British citizen child.  It was relevant also to note the terms  of  the
    decision letter granting leave to the sponsor.  It was said at  page  3
    of 6 (page 12 of the bundle) that there were  insurmountable  obstacles
    to her family life continuing outside the United  Kingdom.   It  was  a
    fundamental point which had to be factored into the balancing exercise.
     It was also relevant to consider the appellant's circumstances as they
    were and are in Gambia.  It could not be said that  family  life  could
    continue outside the United Kingdom.

12.  In the circumstances of it being agreed there were  errors  of  law  in
    the judge's decision, it was also  agreed  that  the  matter  would  be
    remade in the Upper Tribunal.

13.  As noted above, I bear in  mind  the  errors  of  law  in  the  judge's
    decision  in  the  proportionality  evaluation.   In  particular,  when
    remaking the decision I must bear in mind that it  is  claimed  on  the
    appellant's behalf that her mother has sole responsibility for her, and
    it is necessary  to  take  into  account  Home  Office  policy  on  the
    reasonableness of return of a British citizen child and  the  terms  of
    the letter of the grant of leave to the sponsor.

14.  As the judge pointed out in his decision, the question of  whether  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules are  met  is  a  significant  and
    weighty issue within the proportionality assessment.  If they  are  met
    the public interest in maintaining immigration control is weakened.

15.  It is necessary therefore to consider the provisions of  paragraph  297
    of HC 395.  It states as follows:

         "(i) is seeking leave to enter to accompany or join a parent in one
             of the following circumstances:


              ...


              (e) one parent is present and settled in  the  United  Kingdom
                  ... and  has  had  sole  responsibility  for  the  child's
                  upbringing; or


              (f) one parent or a relative is present  and  settled  in  the
                  United Kingdom ... and there are  serious  and  compelling
                  family or other considerations which make exclusion of the
                  child undesirable and suitable arrangements have been made
                  for the child's care; and


         (ii) is under the age of 18; and


         (iii)    is not leading an independent life, is  unmarried  and  is
             not a civil partner, and has not formed an independent  family
             unit; and


         (iv) can, and will, be accommodated adequately by  the  parent  the
             child is seeking to join without recourse to public  funds  in
             accommodation  which  the  parent   ...   owns   or   occupies
             exclusively; and


         (v)  can, and will, be maintained adequately by the parent  without
             recourse to public funds".


16.  The judge left aside the financial and accommodation  requirements  as,
    it was said the sponsor had no status to make the  application  because
    she cannot meet the requirements of paragraph 297(e)  as  she  did  not
    have settled status.

17.  The point Mr Ahmed makes on this is that  the  appellant's  mother  had
    limited leave to remain as a partner under Appendix  FM  and  therefore
    met the requirements of  E-ECC.1.6.  of  Appendix  FM  with  regard  to
    relationship requirements which states as follows:

         "One of the applicant's parents must be  in  the  UK  with  limited
         leave to enter or remain, or be applying or have applied, for entry
         clearance, as a partner or a parent under this  Appendix  (referred
         to in this section as the 'applicant's parent'), and


         (a)  the applicant's parent's partner under Appendix FM is  also  a
             parent of the applicant; or


         (b)  the applicant's parent has had  and  continues  to  have  sole
             responsibility for the child's upbringing; or


         (c)   there  are   serious   and   compelling   family   or   other
             considerations which make exclusion of the  child  undesirable
             and suitable arrangements  have  been  made  for  the  child's
             care".

18.  I accept that potentially the appellant can come within this  provision
    subject to a finding either that her mother has had  and  continues  to
    have sole responsibility for her upbringing, or that there are  serious
    and compelling family or other considerations which make  exclusion  of
    the child undesirable and suitable arrangements have been made for  her
    care.

19.   As  noted  above  the  sponsor's  evidence  was  that  she  has   sole
    responsibility for the appellant.  She said the appellant's father does
    not have any contact with the child nor does he play any  role  in  the
    child's life.  The appellant's mother, Ms Joof, left Gambia in December
    2000 to come to London to study and according to her statement left the
    appellant under the care of her mother.  Subsequently,  as  her  mother
    became ill Ms Joof's aunt, her adopted uncle's wife, took her in for  a
    year and thereafter the appellant stayed with Ms Joof's late father and
    mother.  The aunt moved back to Gambia in July 2006 until  August  2008
    and was then looked after by a friend for a year until  the  aunt  came
    back to the Gambia in 2009.  She stayed with that aunt until 2010.  The
    appellant then stayed with her aunt's  niece  from  September  2011  to
    August 2012.  Her mother managed to  put  her  through  school  in  the
    Gambia.  Her husband went to Gambia to see the appellant  in  2013  and
    saw what a difficult life she was living.  It seems from  the  evidence
    of Mr Silk, the appellant's  stepfather,  that  the  appellant  had  no
    stability and was vulnerable to changes of carers.  He  felt  that  she
    was sometimes used as a house servant and not treated as  an  equal  in
    the household she was living in and people moved in and out and  pushed
    her down the pecking order (she shares accommodation  with  five  other
    girls) and that he thought this built up to a form of mental abuse.

20.  It seems therefore that the  appellant,  since  her  mother  left,  has
    lived with a number of family members and  friends  during  that  time.
    The evidence of her mother is that the appellant's father is completely
    out of the picture and that she is the  one  who  has  represented  the
    element of continuity in her life.  She herself had gone to  Gambia  in
    2015 for the appellant's graduation when she stayed at  a  hotel.   Her
    concerns for the appellant were mainly emotional.

21.  I accept on the basis of this evidence that the appellant's mother  had
    sole responsibility for her.  Also I accept that she continues to  have
    sole responsibility for her.   The  issue  of  serious  and  compelling
    family  or  other  considerations  making  exclusion   of   the   child
    undesirable that suitable arrangements having been made for her care is
    an alternative under paragraph E-ECC.1.6., and therefore I do not  need
    to make any findings in that regard.  The  other  requirements  of  the
    Rule concerning support and accommodation I also find to be met.  It is
    clear from the evidence of Mr Silk that  he  has  sufficient  financial
    resources to make sure the appellant would not make calls on the public
    purse and he will not require any further financial support from the UK
    Government upon her arrival in the United Kingdom.  There  is  evidence
    of his financial circumstances in the bundle which  shows  that  he  is
    earning over �60,000 a year.  His only other responsibilities  are  for
    his wife and their infant child.  It is clear that  the  appellant  has
    not formed an independent family unit living as she does  with  several
    other young people in accommodation in Gambia and she is not married or
    in a civil partnership and is not leading an independent  life.   These
    are  all  relevant  factors  to  be  placed  into  the  proportionality
    evaluation.

22.  In addition it is clearly relevant to bear  in  mind  the  respondent's
    policy that a British citizen child could not reasonably be expected to
    leave the United Kingdom as  would  be  the  case  of  the  appellant's
    stepbrother.  His best interests are  required  to  be  considered  and
    those clearly are  that  he  remains  with  his  parents.   It  is  the
    respondent's policy that it would not be reasonable to expect  him  and
    them to relocate to the Gambia.

Notice of Decision

23.  It  is  clearly  weighty  in  evaluating  the  proportionality  of  the
    decision when challenged, that I find the requirements of the  relevant
    Immigration Rules to be satisfied.  As it is an entry clearance case, I
    bear in mind the  guidance  in  SS  (Congo)  [2015]  EWCA  Civ  387  at
    paragraphs 39-42.

24.  In essence, where an  applicant  for  leave  to  enter  can  show  that
    compelling circumstances exist (which are not  sufficiently  recognised
    under the Rules) it may be appropriate to grant leave.

25.  In my view such circumstances have been made out in this case,  bearing
    in mind also that I have found the relevant requirements of  the  Rules
    to be satisfied and my findings on the evidence above.  On any remaking
    of the decision, I allow the appeal under Article  8  of  the  European
    Convention on Human Rights.

26.  No anonymity direction is made.
