               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     No appearance
For the Respondent:    Mr C. Avery, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. In view of the decision that I now make, it is immaterial that  neither
    the appellant nor his solicitors, Hersi & Co.,  have  appeared.   I  am
    satisfied they have been served.

 2. It is conceded by Mr Avery that the First-tier Tribunal Judge  made  an
    error of law for the reasons set out in the grounds of  appeal  to  the
    Upper Tribunal.  I therefore set aside the ruling of the judge that the
    appeal had been abandoned.

 3. The Upper Tribunal is in a position to re-make the decision.   In  view
    of the First-tier Tribunal Judge's findings on the alternative basis as
    set out in paragraphs 5 to 10 of his determination, Mr  Avery  conceded
    that the appellant's substantive appeal  should  be  allowed.   As  the
    appellant already has temporary leave until 2020, it will  be  for  the
    respondent to decide how this decision should be reflected in the grant
    of any further leave.  It is unnecessary to point out the importance of
    consistency in decision-making and I note that the other members of the
    appellant's family in the UK have been granted indefinite leave.


                                                               ANDREW JORDAN
                                          DEPUTY JUDGE OF THE UPPER TRIBUNAL
                                                            20 December 2018
