Representation:
Appellant   Ms Johnstone (Home Office Presenting Officer)
Respondent  Represented by the sponsor, Mr Javed


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Whereas the original respondent is the appealing party, I shall, in the
    interests of convenience and consistency, replicate the nomenclature of
    the decision at first instance.

 2. The appellant, citizen of Pakistan, applied on February 11, 2014 for  a
    family visit visa to come to the United Kingdom to meet the sponsor and
    other family  members.  The  respondent  refused  this  application  on
    February 27, 2014 and a limited right of appeal under section  84(1)(c)
    of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 was  offered.  This
    appeal was lodged on March 27, 2014 and at  paragraphs  [40]  and  [46]
    human rights issues were raised.

 3. The appeal came before  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Hague  on
    September 17, 2014 and he allowed  the  appeal  under  the  Immigration
    Rules in a decision promulgated on October 1, 2014.

 4. The respondent sought permission to appeal that decision on October  7,
    2014 on the ground the judge had erred by allowing the appeal under the
    Immigration Rules when no  power  existed.  Permission  to  appeal  was
    granted by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Pullig on November 13, 2014
    on that basis.

 5. The matter came before me on the above date and on that  date  I  heard
    submissions from both Mr Javed and Ms Johnstone.

 6. The First-tier  Tribunal  did  not  make  an  anonymity  direction  and
    pursuant to Rule 14 of The Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 I make no order now.

    ERROR IN LAW

 7. I indicated to both parties that there was a clear error in law because
    as identified in both the grounds and the grant of permission the judge
    had no power to allow the appeal under the Rules as he  merely  had  an
    appeal under human rights before him. There was therefore a clear error
    in law and I set aside that decision.

    DISCUSSION AND FINDING

 8. The Judge had not dealt  with  the  matter  that  was  before  him  and
    accordingly I asked Mr Javed for some details about the  appellant  and
    himself and other family members. It was apparent from his account that
    the appellant was self-sufficient in Pakistan with a large  family  and
    was not dependant on any of his family  either  here  or  in  Pakistan.
    Similarly, his family in the United Kingdom were not dependant on  him.
    Ms Johnstone had no questions for him and I indicated to Mr Javed  that
    I would have to consider any human rights claim in light of Kaur (visit
    appeals; article 8) [2015] UKUT 00487  (IAC),  Mostafa  (article  8  in
    entry clearance) [2015] UKUT 00112 (IAC) and Adjei (visit visas-article
    8) [2015] UKUT 0261 (IAC).

 9. The Tribunal has made clear that in order to succeed under article 8 in
    a visit visa appeal the appellant will have to  demonstrate  a  factual
    content to the claimed private and family  life.  In  other  words  the
    appellant has to demonstrate real family ties and  simply  meeting  the
    Rules does not mean article 8(1) is engaged. The denial  of  the  visit
    has to have a material impact on article 8(1) rights and  the  evidence
    from Mr Javed was  that  he  saw  the  appellant  whenever  he  visited
    Pakistan and that he had seen him on three or four occasions  over  the
    last ten years.

10. Additionally, ties between two adults will not  as  a  rule  constitute
    family life for article 8 (1) purposes unless there is dependency  over
    and above normal emotional ties (Singh and another [2015] EWCA Civ 74).

11. As there is no dependency between the appellant and sponsor  or  anyone
    else in the United Kingdom article 8(1) is not engaged. As article 8(1)
    is not engaged I am not required to consider the other tests set out in
    Razgar [2004] UKHL 00027 and in particular the proportionality  of  the
    decision.

    DECISION

12. There was a material  error  and  I  set  aside  the  earlier  decision
    including the fee award made.

13. I have  remade  the  decision  and  dismissed  the  appeal  under  ECHR
    legislation.
