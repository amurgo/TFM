For the Appellant:           -
For the Respondent:    Mr McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Lithuania born in 1996. He appeals  with
    permission the decision of the First-tier Tribunal (Judge  Lloyd-Smith)
    to dismiss his appeal against the Respondent's decision to deport  him,
    pursuant to regulation 27 of the Immigration (European  Economic  Area)
    Regulations 2016 ('the Regs').






    Proceeding in the Appellant's Absence


 2. The hearing of  this  appeal  was  listed  at  10.00am.  There  was  no
    appearance by or on behalf of the Appellant.  My clerk informed me that
    the solicitors last on record, TMC Solicitors in Manchester,  had  come
    off the record. Mr McVeety checked the Home Office records. In doing so
    he discovered that the Appellant had in  fact  been  removed  from  the
    United Kingdom on the 12th March 2019, only four days after Judge Grant-
    Hutchinson had granted him permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal.




 3. Before proceeding in the absence of the Appellant the following  checks
    were undertaken:

      i) I established through the Tribunal record system ('FHINS') that the
         Appellant had not made an application for a stay on his removal  to
         Lithuania;


     ii) I spoke with Mr Chugtai of TMC Solicitors who  confirmed  that  the
         Appellant's family in the United Kingdom had  been  made  aware  of
         this hearing and that all notices of hearing sent to TMC  had  been
         forwarded to their address;


    iii) Neither the Home Office, nor Mr Chugtai, nor  the  Tribunal  record
         hold any current contact details for the Appellant in Lithuania;


     iv) The Appellant has not made an application to return to  the  United
         Kingdom in order to attend this hearing;


      v) There has been no contact with the Tribunal by the Appellant or any
         member of his family since the First-tier Tribunal hearing.

 4. Having had regard to all of this information I decided  that  it  would
    not be in the interests of justice to adjourn this matter in  order  to
    give the Appellant an opportunity to participate in these  proceedings.
    That is because I was satisfied that there was at this stage little  to
    no prospect of contact being re-established. The Appellant's  solicitor
    came off record only because the Appellant ceased contact  and  he  was
    without instructions. The Appellant was  clearly  aware,  at  the  very
    least, that he had an application for  permission  pending  before  the
    Upper Tribunal. It has now been three months since that application was
    made. It would remain open to the Appellant to  remain  in  touch  with
    either that solicitor or the  Tribunal  if  he  wished  to  pursue  the
    appeal. Mr Chugtai has further spoken with the Appellant's  family  who
    have been unable to furnish  him  with  any  contact  details  for  the
    Appellant.   I therefore decided to proceed  with  the  appeal  in  the
    absence of the Appellant.




    Background


 5. The Appellant claims to have arrived in the United Kingdom in 2011 when
    he was aged 15. He attended school and upon  leaving  was  for  a  time
    employed as a security guard.  Between the 1st June 2016 and  the  30th
    September 2017 - when he was caught - he was engaged in a conspiracy to
    steal motor vehicles. This conspiracy involved  him  cloning  keys  and
    putting false registration plates on luxury vehicles. In sentencing him
    to a period of 21 months' imprisonment the trial judge stated  that  he
    had played  a  "significant  if  not  leading  role"  in  the  criminal
    conspiracy.   The  Respondent  duly  made  a  decision  to  deport  the
    Appellant from the United Kingdom. The Appellant exercised his right of
    appeal.


 6. When the matter came before the First-tier Tribunal the first  question
    was whether the Appellant had accrued a period of five years continuous
    residence in accordance with the Regs so  as  to  attract  a  right  of
    permanent residence, and a higher degree of protection  from  exclusion
    under the Regs.  Although  it  was  accepted  that  the  Appellant  had
    attended school in the United Kingdom,  his  Counsel  conceded  on  his
    behalf that he could not be considered as a  'qualified  person'  as  a
    student because he did not have comprehensive  sickness  cover.  Rather
    the Appellant contended that he had  accrued  his  five  years  as  the
    family member of an EEA national  exercising  treaty  rights,  viz  his
    mother whom  he  said  had  been  economically  active  throughout  the
    relevant period.  The Tribunal rejected this contention.   The evidence
    was inconsistent and  the  Appellant's  mother  was  an  unsatisfactory
    witness for several reasons. Further there was "no evidence whatsoever"
    to support the claim that she had been economically  active  throughout
    the five years.

 7. That finding meant that when the Tribunal came to make  its  assessment
    of whether the Appellant should be deported, it did  so  on  the  basis
    that he attracted no enhanced protection from expulsion  (ie  "serious"
    or "imperative" grounds). The question was whether the  Respondent  had
    shown the deportation to be justified having regard  to  the  following
    matters set out in Reg 27:

         (5)      The public policy and public security requirements of  the
         United Kingdom include restricting rights  otherwise  conferred  by
         these Regulations in order to protect the fundamental interests  of
         society, and where a relevant  decision  is  taken  on  grounds  of
         public  policy  or  public  security  it  must  also  be  taken  in
         accordance with the following principles-


             (a) the decision must comply with the principle of
             proportionality;


             (b) the decision must be based exclusively on the personal
             conduct of the person concerned;


             (c) the personal conduct of the person must represent a
             genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one
             of the fundamental interests of society, taking into account
             past conduct of the person and that the threat does not need
             to be imminent;


             (d) matters isolated from the particulars of the case or which
             relate to considerations of general prevention do not justify
             the decision;


             (e) a person's previous criminal convictions do not in
             themselves justify the decision;


             (f) the decision may be taken on preventative grounds, even in
             the absence of a previous criminal conviction, provided the
             grounds are specific to the person.


         (6)      Before taking a relevant decision on the grounds of public
         policy and public security in relation to a  person  ("P")  who  is
         resident in the  United  Kingdom,  the  decision  maker  must  take
         account of considerations such as the age, state of health,  family
         and economic situation of P, P's length of residence in the  United
         Kingdom, P's  social  and  cultural  integration  into  the  United
         Kingdom and the extent of P's links with P's country of origin.

 8. The Tribunal took into account the fact that the Appellant  was,  prior
    to his conviction, a man of good character.  It  described  him  as  an
    "intelligent and hardworking young man" who had managed to  pass  GCSEs
    very soon after his arrival in the United Kingdom, had gone on to  take
    other qualifications  and  had,  in  his  role  as  a  security  guard,
    apprehended a shoplifter who had produced a syringe and announced  that
    he was a drug addict.  The determination recognises that the  Appellant
    was only 15 when he came here, and that he has a number of close family
    members living in the United Kingdom including his mother, brother  and
    sister. These matters were all weighed in his favour.


 9. The matters  that  weighed  against  the  Appellant  were  these.   The
    sentencing judge, and Tribunal, were  satisfied  that  the  Appellant's
    role in the conspiracy was  significant.   He  had  however  sought  to
    diminish his role by stating  that  he  was  young  and  influenced  by
    others. When asked at hearing whether he would  maintain  contact  with
    the other criminals involved in the conspiracy he said "probably  not",
    which was not a categorical assertion that he had turned  his  back  on
    these associates.  As for his role in apprehending a  shoplifter,  this
    was commendable, but it was after all his job at the time, and  he  had
    been fortunate to receive  a  significant  reduction  in  his  sentence
    because of this incident.  The Tribunal  was  not  satisfied  that  the
    family circumstances were as  they  were  portrayed  in  the  evidence.
    Although it was claimed that his family  in  the  United  Kingdom  were
    close, there was lack of contact when he was in prison,  they  had  not
    been able to prevent him committing the offences in  the  first  place.
    His mother and sister attended the hearing but  did  so  "without  much
    forward  planning".  They  had  a  flight  booked  to  Lithuania   that
    afternoon. Since they knew that the case might have still been  running
    into the afternoon the Tribunal inferred from their flight booking that
    they were not that interested in assisting the Appellant: "to therefore
    have pre-booked flights to Lithuania on the same day from  a  different
    city goes some  way  to  indicate  where  their  priorities  lay".  The
    Appellant and his family members claimed that their ties  to  Lithuania
    were minimal and that the Appellant would have no-one to help  him  re-
    establish himself there.   The Tribunal had regard to the contradictory
    evidence about why his mother and sister were going to  Lithuania,  and
    how often they go; it concluded from this that the most  likely  reason
    they were going was to visit relatives.  These regular trips also meant
    that the Appellant could maintain contact with his family here.


10. In respect of  rehabilitation  the  Tribunal  was  not  satisfied  that
    deportation would prejudice his  prospects  of  this,  particularly  in
    light of the fact that he failed to complete any courses in prison, and
    his comments about his criminal associates here.

11. Weighing all of these matters in the  balance  the  Tribunal  concluded
    that the Respondent had discharged the burden of proof,  and  dismissed
    the appeal.



    Error of Law: Discussion and Findings

12. The first ground of appeal is that the Tribunal erred in fact  when  it
    states, at paragraph 31, that there is "no evidence whatsoever" of  the
    Appellant's mother being a qualified person. In the bundle  before  the
    Tribunal was a letter from HMRC  confirming  that  from  2014  she  was
    employed and paying taxes. The  Appellant  submits  that  the  Tribunal
    erred in overlooking that documentary evidence.


13. That documentary  evidence  was  irrelevant.   The  Tribunal  expressly
    accepted that the Appellant's mother was employed  from  2014  on.  The
    period in issue was the two years preceding that. The five-year  period
    identified at the hearing was from the 12th  March  2012  to  the  12th
    March 2017, that being the Appellant's 21st birthday, and the day  that
    he ceased to be a 'family member' under the Regs.  The HMRC letter  was
    silent about the period prior to employment commencing. At the  hearing
    the Judge was told that the Appellant's mother had been earning �8000pa
    in 2008-2014 as a self  employed  cleaner.  This  was  contradicted  by
    written evidence from  her  daughter  that  prior  to  commencing  that
    employment in 2014 she had been an unemployed housewife.  There was  no
    evidence from HMRC to confirm that any taxes had been  paid  in  either
    2012 or 2013.  The Judge was quite correct to find that the  burden  of
    proof on this matter had not been discharged.

14. Ground 1  further  contends  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  erred  in
    overlooking material evidence to the effect that the Appellant's sister
    had been working. What the relevance of that is I have no idea.

15. Ground 2 concerns  the  Tribunal's  approach  to  rehabilitation.    In
    brief, the first point made is that the  Tribunal  was  unjustified  in
    characterising the Appellant as someone seeking to evade responsibility
    for his crime. I reject that. The determination  quotes  directly  from
    the  Appellant's  own  statement:  "I  was  not  the   ringleader   who
    masterminded the  operation  and  was  naively  influenced".   This  is
    contrasted with the clear conclusions  of  the  trial  judge,  and  his
    uncontested summation of the evidence that it  was  the  Appellant  who
    cloned keys, produced and fitted false licence plates  and  passed  the
    cars on.  It was plainly open  to  the  Tribunal  to  draw  an  adverse
    inference from the Appellant's attitude.

16. Ground 2 also makes reference, at �15, to an 'OASys' report before  the
    Tribunal which stated that the Appellant  presented  a  "low"  risk  of
    reoffending. Other that stating that the document existed, the  grounds
    do not go on to develop an argument as to why that might  be  relevant.
    The OASys report was considered by  Judge  Lloyd-Smith,  who  expressly
    refers to it at her �33. The point there made  is  that  was  the  view
    taken by a probation officer at the time of  sentencing.  Judge  Lloyd-
    Smith  took  that  into  account.  She  also  took  into  account   the
    Appellant's apparent lack of remorse, the lack  of  protective  factors
    preventing re-offending and his equivocal attitude  as  to  whether  he
    might re-establish contact with his co-conspirators.  I do not consider
    that in so doing she erred in law.

17. On a related note, ground 3 concerns the  principles  in  Essa.  It  is
    submitted that the First-tier Tribunal  erred  in  failing  to  make  a
    finding on whether there was no prospect of rehabilitation; taking into
    account the principle of deterrence; and in failing to place weight  on
    the positive evidence of integration in its assessment of propensity to
    reoffend.  In fact the Judge expressly directs herself to consider  the
    principles in Essa, and goes on  to  do  so.   Whilst  Mr  McVeety  was
    prepared to concede that the reference to 'deterring others' at �39 was
    unfortunate, I agree with him that this played only a marginal role  in
    the decision making overall. The Judge had before her a young  man  who
    had taken a  lead  role  in  a  prolonged  and  sophisticated  criminal
    enterprise. He had sought to diminish his own role in the offence,  and
    had not taken the opportunity to emphatically distance himself from the
    other criminals involved. His case was based on  his  allegedly  strong
    family links and support in the  United  Kingdom,  which  upon  careful
    analysis by the Judge, were found to be sorely lacking.

18. The remaining grounds are wholly unmeritorious. Ground  (iv)  describes
    as "truly perplexing" the Tribunal's finding that the planned  trip  to
    Lithuania by the Appellant's mother and sister was "contrived".  If the
    author of the grounds believes the finding to have been that this  trip
    was "contrived" there is little wonder that he is perplexed.  That  was
    not however the  finding  of  the  Tribunal.  The  point  made  in  the
    determination is that the claims being made about the strength  of  the
    bonds in this family was inconsistent with the  actual  evidence:  this
    indicated that his family had not been able to prevent  him  offending,
    had not been to visit him in prison, and that on the very  day  of  his
    deportation appeal they had planned a trip to Lithuania.  The  Tribunal
    was plainly entitled to draw adverse inference from those matters.

19. Ground (v) contends that the Tribunal erred in taking  an  inconsistent
    approach to the aggravating  and  mitigating  features.  Insofar  as  I
    understand the grounds, it  is  submitted  that  the  Tribunal  focused
    unduly on the former and diminished the significance of the latter.  As
    my paragraph 5 above illustrates, that is wholly untrue:  the  Tribunal
    gave full and detailed  regard  to  those  matters  that  went  to  the
    Appellant's credit.

20. For those reasons, I dismiss the appeal.
