                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Clough, promulgated on 12th December 2014, following a hearing at
    Hatton Cross on 9th October 2014.   In  the  determination,  the  judge
    allowed  the  appeal  of  Mrs  Dora  Anane  Frimpong.   The  Respondent
    subsequently applied for, and was granted, permission to appeal to  the
    Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.



The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a female citizen of Ghana who was born on 28th October
    1973.  She sought entry to the UK to settle with  her  husband,  in  an
    application which was refused  on  25th  September  2013,  because  the
    Respondent was not satisfied that the Appellant  was  in  a  subsisting
    relationship with her husband, that no documentation  was  supplied  to
    show that the Sponsor had undergone a valid divorce from  his  previous
    wife; that the Sponsor had not shown he met  the  income  requirements;
    and the Appellant did not supply an original report  for  the  speaking
    part of her English test.

The Judge's Findings

 3. By the time of the appeal before the judge, all but  one  of  the  four
    matters set out above had been conceded by the Secretary of State.   It
    was now said that the only issue on an appeal before Judge  Clough  was
    that the marriage was not a genuine and subsisting one.

 4. The judge considered the evidence.  This included the  refusal  letter,
    but it also included  the  Entry  Clearance  Manager's  review  of  the
    refusal decision (see paragraph 4).  The Sponsor  appeared  before  the
    judge.  He adopted  his  witness  statement.   He  gave  oral  evidence
    (paragraph 5),  he  explained  how  his  wife  called  him  from  Ghana
    regularly (paragraph 6).  He also pointed out that he  sent  money  for
    school fees and bills, and that "he has sent �10,000 in all" (paragraph
    6).  There was evidence before the judge that  the  Sponsor  could  not
    bring his two children here, as he would have to  earn  �24,000.   When
    his wife came they saved and could bring them together.  "The  children
    would stay with their maternal grandmother meanwhile.  She is a  school
    teacher and they would go to her  school"  (paragraph  7).   There  was
    evidence before the judge that the children were  registered  in  their
    births after they were born but that "the  certificates  were  obtained
    for their passports" (paragraph 8).  The judge concluded  that,  "after
    hearing evidence from the Sponsor and considering all  the  information
    before me I am satisfied that the Appellant and the Sponsor's  marriage
    is subsisting and  that  they  intend  to  live  together  in  the  UK"
    (paragraph 9).

 5. The appeal was allowed.

Grounds of Application

 6. The grounds of application state that the judge failed to give adequate
    reasons in support of material findings.  The judge did not record that
    the Sponsor was credible.  He accepted that the  Sponsor  had  divorced
    but did not record whether the divorce certificate was an original or a
    copy.  Furthermore, whilst he  accepted  that  the  Appellant  and  the
    Sponsor intended to live together in the UK, he did not record if  that
    was on a permanent basis.

 7. On 2nd February 2015, permission to appeal was granted.

Submissions

 8. At the hearing before me on 24th March 2015, Miss Isherwood,  appearing
    on behalf of the Respondent Secretary of State, relied upon the refusal
    letter.  She explained that there were extensive reasons given  by  the
    ECO for the refusal.  These extensive reasons were then examined by the
    ECM in his review.  They were endorsed in a decision dated  13th  March
    2014.  This was what the judge was faced with.  For him to be  able  to
    make a sustainable and rational decision,  he  had  to  deal  with  the
    reasons given by the decision  makers  for  refusing  the  application.
    However, there was no proper analysis.  Miss  Isherwood  in  particular
    relied upon the ECO's basis for refusal that:

         "It  is  reasonable  to  expect  that  in  a  genuine   subsisting,
         supportive and affectionate relationship, there will be evidence of
         regular  contact,  signs  of  companionship,   emotional   support,
         affection and an abiding  interest  in  each  other's  welfare  and
         wellbeing ...".

 9. The judge, submitted Miss Isherwood, did not deal  with  any  of  these
    issues.  There was no finding in relation to them.

10. For his part, Mr Talacchi submitted that all the judge needs to  do  is
    to explain why one party won and that the other lost.  This  was  clear
    in the determination.  It was clear,  because  by  the  time  that  the
    matter came before the judge, there was only one issue left of the four
    that had originally been raised, and the  judge  dealt  with  this  one
    issue  very  extensively  from  paragraph  4  to  paragraph  8  of  the
    determination.  He was aware of all the evidence before him.

11. This is why he expressed himself (at paragraph 9) in terms  that,  "...
    considering all the information before  me  I  am  satisfied  that  the
    Appellant and the Sponsor's marriage is subsisting and they  intend  to
    live together in the UK".  He was satisfied that  the  registration  of
    the children's birth was perfectly legitimate.  He was  satisfied  that
    the Sponsor had sent �10,000 to his family abroad.  The  bundle  showed
    (at pages 56 to 58) that over the period there covered there  has  been
    expenditure of over �7,000 by the Sponsor for his family in Ghana.

12. It  is  all  very  well  to  talk  about  a  lack  of  "supportive  and
    affectionate relationship", but there was  evidence,  which  the  judge
    accepted, of the Appellant calling from Ghana "as it was cheaper to  do
    so, using an  Africa  phone  card"  (paragraph  6).   It  was  properly
    explained that "a �5 credit lasted three days and he spoke to his  wife
    and children" (paragraph 6).  It was difficult to  see  what  more  the
    Appellant needed to produce, given that the test was on  a  balance  of
    probabilities, as a threshold for the Appellant to meet.  He  met  that
    admirably.

13. In reply, Miss Isherwood relied upon the case  of  Budhathoki  (reasons
    for decisions) [2014] UKUT 341, which was to the  effect  that  "it  is
    generally unnecessary and unhelpful for First-tier  Tribunal  judgments
    to rehearse every detail or issue raised in a case",  but  that  it  is
    "necessary for judges to identify and  resolve  key  conflicts  in  the
    evidence ...".



No Error of Law

14. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by the  judge  does  not
    amount to an error on a point of law (see Section 12(1) of  TCEA  2007)
    such that I should set aside the decision.  In fact,  the  decision  is
    admirable in its clarity, to the point, and deals with the issue  in  a
    clear and proportionate manner.  There was one issue before the  judge,
    and  one  alone.   This  was  whether  the  marriage  was  genuine  and
    subsisting.

15. The judge considered the evidence at length in  relation  to  this  one
    issue, from paragraphs 4 to 8.  The parties' commitment to  each  other
    was expressly set out at paragraphs 6 and 7.  The  judge  accepted  the
    telephone contact between the parties.  He accepted the monies sent  by
    the Sponsor to the Appellant totalling �10,000  in  all.   He  accepted
    that the Sponsor also shipped items via his brother  for  the  children
    (paragraph  6).   In  addition,  the  judge  recorded,  the  wise   and
    considered decision of the Appellant and the Sponsor, that  they  would
    not seek to bring the children to the  UK  until  such  time  that  the
    Appellant wife had also come to the UK, and started earning  money  and
    saved money, so  that  they  could  meet  the  financial  threshold  of
    �24,000, which they at present could not (see paragraph 7).

16. To suggest that the judge had failed to make it clear that the parties,
    now intending to live together in a genuine  and  subsisting  marriage,
    did not intend to do so on a "permanent" basis is untenable.  It is  as
    untenable to say that the judge failed to record  whether  the  divorce
    certificate was an original or a copy.  The judge accepted the evidence
    before him.  It cannot be over-emphasised that the  only  issue  before
    the judge was whether the marriage was genuine and subsisting.

17. The judge gave  a  determination  that  was  perfectly  compliant  with
    Budhathoki in that the parties know why they won or lost.   The  reason
    why Budhathoki makes it clear that  it  is  generally  unnecessary  and
    unhelpful to rehearse every detail raised, is because  "this  leads  to
    judgments becoming overly long and confused and is not a  proportionate
    approach to deciding cases".  In this case, the  judge  abided  by  the
    principle.  There is no error.  The decision stands.

Notice of Decision

18. There is no material error of law in  the  original  judge's  decision.
    The determination shall stand.

19. No anonymity order is made.
