Appellant

                            DECISION AND REASONS


    Direction Regarding Anonymity -  Rule  14  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
    (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008
    Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs otherwise,  the  Appellant
    is granted anonymity.  No report of these proceedings shall directly or
    indirectly identify him.  This direction applies both to the  Appellant
    and to the Respondent.  Failure to comply  with  this  direction  could
    lead to contempt of court proceedings.

 1. The appellant is a national  of  Turkey.  He  appeals  with  permission
    against the decision of First-tier Tribunal  ("FtTJ"),  promulgated  on
    the 6 August 2019 dismissing his appeal against the decision to  refuse
    his protection and human rights claim.

 2. The appellant's history is set out in the decision  letter  of  the  24
    February 2019 and the decision of  the  FtTJ  at  paragraphs  1-3.  The
    appellant arrived in the United Kingdom having been  granted  leave  as
    student from 2012 until January 2013. He  was  issued  with  a  6-month
    student visa on xxxxx 2016  and  entered  the  using  his  own  Turkish
    passport with a student visa valid until xxxxxxxx 2016. He applied  for
    leave to remain under the EC Association Agreement which was refused on
    the 7 June 2017. On the 29 December 2017 return preparations were  made
    for his departure to Turkey and on the 29 March 2018 he was served with
    a RED.0001 for overstaying his leave.  He  then  made  a  human  rights
    application on the 10th April 2018 which was refused on the 18th  April
    2018.  He made a claim for asylum on 12th June 2018.

 3. He provided a screening interview and was interviewed about the factual
    basis of his claim on December 3rd 2018. The basis of his claim can  be
    summarised as follows. The appellant claimed to  be  a  member  of  the
    Gulen Movement (also referred to as "FETO") which he stated had  joined
    when he was 18 years of age as he was introduced to the elder  brothers
    (ABIs) when at university.

 4. His role in FETO was  to  obtain  subscribers  to  a  newspaper  called
    "Zaman". In interview he said he also went to different shopkeepers and
    asked them to subscribe to the Zaman (Q35), a  FETO  newspaper  He  was
    also forced to read books and listen to cassettes by the ABI's and  was
    given no choice but to pray five times a day. That is why he  left  the
    house with them as he did not want to pray  and  did  not  want  to  be
    forced to listen to the  material  that  they  gave  him.  He  did  not
    identify any other role that he had participated in support of FETO.

 5. He later stated that he had taken part in  meetings  and  that  he  had
    agreed with all their thoughts at the time. When asked to describe what
    happened at the meetings he attended he  said  that  they  were  normal
    gathering of friends sitting down talking having  team  nothing  to  do
    with terror.

 6. He stayed in FETO accommodation for 1 ï¿½ months.

 7. He stated that nothing could attract him to the FETO  organisation  but
    found it comfortable that he was able to stay in the accommodation rent-
    free.

 8. Since 2016 he had not continued his support with FETO and had  not  had
    any problems the Turkish authorities. He confirmed  in  interview  that
    between 2013 - 2016 he was a completely away from FETO (Q63).

 9. On 5 November 2016 he received a phone call from his father  in  Turkey
    informing him that the Turkish  authorities  had  searched  the  family
    home. When they arrived, they took the family  computer  and  took  his
    father to the police station where they questioned him for four  hours.
    The police asked where the appellant was and whether his father had any
    connections to FETO.

10. The appellant stated he had  not  completed  his  national  service  in
    Turkey and was able to postpone that until 2017 but  as  he  is  now  a
    fugitive from the Turkish government if sent back he will  be  made  to
    join the army.

11. In a decision letter dated the 24 February 2019, the respondent refused
    his claim for asylum and humanitarian protection.

12. As can be seen within those paragraphs, the Secretary of State set  out
    a number of credibility issues relating to  the  core  aspects  of  his
    claim to be of interest to the Turkish authorities. In relation to  his
    claimed involvement in FETO,  the  respondent  made  reference  to  his
    account of duties within FETO,  his  own  personal  motivations  behind
    joining the organisation  along  with  the  objectives  of  FETO.  When
    considering his answers in his interviews, the respondent noted that on
    his own admission he was forced to  participate  in  the  FETO  related
    activities and he did not pursue them out of his own will and that when
    given an opportunity to provide  his  motivations  behind  joining  the
    organisation, he stated that nothing had attracted him but he  had  met
    some friends. The respondent considered  that  the  appellant  had  not
    provided any details as to what had drawn  him  to  the  movement.  The
    respondent also took into account that he had stated that he was not in
    a good situation financially and that he would be more  comfortable  if
    he was working on renting the house. Therefore  it  was  noted  by  the
    respondent that his intentions are staying at the houses  of  FETO  was
    not because he was motivated to be involved  in  the  organisation  but
    because it helped his financial situation.

13. As to the meetings he claimed to have attended, the answers he provided
    as to what the meetings were about  was  considered  to  be  vague  and
    lacking in  detail  and  he  had  failed  to  provide  details  of  the
    "thoughts" that he agreed with.

14. When asked to provide information  about  the  cassettes  that  he  was
    forced to listen to and the books he read, the respondent noted that he
    had failed to provide any specific information about the cassettes that
    he had listened to (see Q45) and could not give specific details  about
    the information that he had obtained by listening to those cassette. He
    also stated that he did not read any books  in  connection  with  FETO.
    Thus the respondent considered that he had not remained consistent with
    the FETO activities that he participated in.

15. The appellant had been asked in interview to provide information  about
    the organisation, but he could not provide any timeframe as to when the
    movement was founded. As to the aims of the organisation he set out his
    reply at question 58. However the account given was  considered  to  be
    inconsistent with the level of detail expected from  a  member  of  the
    organisation.

16. He was asked how the organisation of FETO implemented their  aims,  and
    he stated "if we were to follow the path of  Hoca  Efendi  good  things
    will happen to us we will  have  a  good  community  and  working  good
    employment and bring about children in a better way  by  following  his
    teaching" (Q58).  That  answer  was  assessed  against  the  background
    information, but the respondent considered that his account  was  vague
    and lacking in specific details. It  failed  to  provide  any  detailed
    information with regards the motivations within  the  organisation  and
    how the organisation implemented these aims. The account  provided  was
    inconsistent with the level of detail expected from  a  member  of  the
    movement.

17. It  was  further  considered  that  he  provided  no  evidence  of  his
    involvement in the organisation.

18. As to his claim that either on 15 November 2016 on 5 November  that  he
    was informed that his affiliation  with  FETO  I  brought  him  to  the
    attention of the authorities, it was noted that he had made no  mention
    about that event in his screening interview or his PIF. When given  the
    opportunity to make any amendments to  his  account  in  the  screening
    interview, he made no mention of it

19. it was further noted that if his FETO affiliation would be accepted, he
    only had a minor role within the  movement  and  that  his  affiliation
    ceased in 2013 and therefore there was no reasonable explanation  given
    by him as to why he would be of interest to the Turkish authorities.

20. Whilst the respondent  considered  the  country  materials  which  made
    reference to 50,000 people having been jailed for suspected ties to the
    attempted takeover in July, it was noted that the appellant left Turkey
    before the coup attempt and that he had not demonstrated  that  he  had
    held a position within the movement or that his occupation  that  would
    have brought him to the attention of the  authorities,  for  example  a
    civil servant, as he was a hotel  receptionist.  By  reference  to  the
    country materials that linked people to FETO, the respondent  concluded
    that he had made no mention of holding a bank account with bank Asya or
    being affiliated with the  Gulen  affiliated  institution.  Whilst  his
    account of affiliation with FETO had been rejected by  the  respondent,
    it was noted that even if it had been  accepted,  Zaman  newspaper  was
    Turkey's biggest newspaper and had given no reasonable  explanation  as
    to how it would come to the attention of the Turkish authorities on the
    account provided. Given his  own  evidence  that  he  had  stopped  any
    affiliation in 2013, he had given no reasonable explanation as  to  how
    he came to the attention of the Turkish authorities.

21. The respondent made reference to the arrest warrant  provided,  however
    it was noted that the arrest  warrant  stated  that  he  could  not  be
    interviewed by the Turkish  police  on  6  November  2016  however  the
    appellant stated that his  father  told  him  about  this  event  on  5
    November 2016, a day  before  the  event  occurred.  Therefore  it  was
    considered the appellant's evidence was inconsistent  that  his  father
    had informed him of this event before it took place.  The  warrant  not
    been presented in black ink and had been signed  by  hand  whereas  the
    translation stated that the arrest warrant been  signed  electronically
    therefore no weight was attached to that document.

22. As  to  military  service,  it  was  noted  that  military  service  is
    compulsory for all male citizens between 20 - 41  years  of  age  (with
    some exceptions such as the  mentally  ill,  or  for  health  reasons).
    However it was further noted that the appellant was  able  to  postpone
    military service whilst abroad and that given the age  he  was  at  the
    time for studies and the age at  the  time  came  to  the  UK,  it  was
    accepted that he had not completed his national service.  Consideration
    was given to the country materials and that penalties the draft evasion
    and desertion would not normally be regarded as persecution. As regards
    Turkish national service, the  guidance  stated  that  in  general  the
    conditions and/or treatment likely to be faced by  person  required  to
    undertake compulsory military service would  not  be  so  harsh  as  to
    amount to persecution or serious harm. The respondent also  noted  that
    the Turkish Parliament in 2018 and ratified a  law  which  will  enable
    Turkish citizens to reduce the term of their military service by paying
    a certain amount of  money.  The  law  would  enable  men  to  complete
    military service in 21 days instead of 5 ï¿½ or 12  months  if  they  are
    university graduates and pay an  amount  of  money  to  the  government
    through bank accounts.

23. According to the law, citizens born on or before January 1,  1994  will
    be required to complete just 21 days of military service  if  they  pay
    15,000 Turkish lira.

24. The respondent therefore concluded that it not been  demonstrated  that
    he would be at a real risk of persecution or serious harm on return  to
    Turkey.

25.  The  appellant  sought  to  appeal  that  decision.   In  a   decision
    promulgated on the 6 August 2019, the FtTJ dismissed the appeal  having
    concluded that the appellant had not  given  a  credible  or  plausible
    account as to his activities in Turkey and that he would not be at risk
    of persecution or serious harm contrary to Article 3, either on account
    of any political opinion held or imputed to him by the  authorities  or
    by reasons of his claim relating to military service.

26. Following the dismissal of his appeal, grounds of  appeal  were  issued
    for permission to appeal and that application was refused by Designated
    First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Manuell  on  the  30   August   2019.   On
    reconsideration was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Grubb on  the  17th
    September 2019. He refused to grant permission on ground 3 relating  to
    the appellant's claim outside  the  Rules  but  granted  permission  on
    grounds 1 and 2.

27. As a result of the grant of permission  the  appeal  comes  before  the
    Upper Tribunal, Ms Cleghorn of Counsel who  appeared  before  the  FtTJ
    relied upon the grounds as drafted.

Ground 1:

28. Dealing with ground 1, she submitted that the judge had found that  the
    appellant was only interested in FETO when they offered  him  financial
    personal gain, but he was not truly interested in  their  doctrines  at
    paragraph 14. However the judge then  made  an  entirely  contradictory
    finding when she stated that "he knows little  about  the  organisation
    and it is unlikely that he was involved in it in anyway" (at [15]). She
    submitted that it was not clear whether she believed the appellant  was
    involved in FETO at all and this was significant because of the country
    materials dealing with the risk for those involved in the movement. She
    submitted that the authorities would not care why someone would involve
    themselves in FETO and the judge had found that  he  did  this  because
    they had offered him financial gain. Thus she submitted, the judge  had
    made inconsistent findings at paragraphs 14 and 15.

29. She submitted that at paragraph 16 the judge made a  finding  that  she
    accepted  that  he  was  involved  again,  and  this  was   a   further
    inconsistent finding.

30. Ms Cleghorn direct the Tribunal to paragraph 17 of  the  decision.  The
    written grounds stated that it was not clear why the judge assumed that
    the appellant would give a university address stating "no one in  their
    right mind would for example give halls  of  residence  as  their  home
    address. It is submitted that it is far more likely that until a person
    has established a permanent address i.e. one  that  goes  beyond  eight
    months of the  year,  would  give  their  parents  address  until  they
    actually ceased living with their parents". In her oral submissions she
    submitted that the judge reached a finding that he lived away from home
    and did not accept that that address would be as home address but  that
    somebody would not give their address as their university address.

31. She submitted that the country materials  (Human  Rights  Watch,  World
    Report 2018 Turkey January 2018) at  page  6  relating  to  freedom  of
    expression, association and assembly made reference to the  prosecution
    and jailing of journalists who were doing their  work  which  continued
    after the closing of media outlets since the  coup  attempt.  She  made
    reference to a first trial hearing in March of a group  of  journalists
    accused of FETO membership, the court releasing on bail  21  defendants
    had been  held  in  prolonged  pre-trial  detention  but  later  a  new
    investigation was undertaken, and none were released. The three  judges
    who had ruled to release the journalists were suspended along with  the
    prosecutor. The trial of the 19 journalists and board members and other
    personnel from the Cumhuriyet newspaper on charges of FETO links  began
    on July 24. At page 10  of  the  AB  (OHCHR  report  on  the  state  of
    emergency on human rights in Turkey January - December 2017, 20/3/2018)
    the report made reference to the  state  of  emergency  having  led  to
    considerable limitations of the civic space. The government permanently
    closed   1719   organisations/human   rights,   humanitarian,   lawyers
    associations, foundations and NGOs. It liquidated  166  media  outlets,
    including publishing houses,  newspapers  and  magazines,  newsagent's,
    television stations and radios. The closing down of media  outlets  was
    accompanied  by  the  confiscation  of   all   their   assets   without
    compensation. Over a hundred thousand websites were reportedly  blocked
    in 2017 including a high number of pro-Kurdish websites  and  satellite
    TVs. The climate of fear and judicial  harassment  has  compelled  many
    immediate human right  NGOs  to  self-censorship.  She  submitted  that
    against that background it was plausible that if his name was found  on
    a computer the authorities would consider that he was  associated  with
    FETO.  She  submitted  that  this  was  particularly  the  position  as
    evidenced at paragraph 43 of the same report where it was  stated  that
    the presidential decrees adopted since  July  2016  had  broadened  the
    scope of the original emergency to include measures against individuals
    who "belong to, connect  to,  or  have  contact  with  the  Fetullahist
    terrorist organisation and public personnel  who  have  membership  in,
    affiliation or connection with the organisation as well as the  spouses
    and children of such persons".

32. Ms Cleghorn referred the Tribunal to page 33 AB (Stockholm  Centre  for
    freedom (SCF) Turkish government  conducts  38,725  operations  against
    alleged  members  of  Goole  and  movement  in  year  dated  30/10/2018
    article). She submitted that the Turkish  police  conducted  38,007  25
    operations against FETO in a year and that a total of 19,007 people had
    been detained over  alleged  links  to  the  movement  by  the  end  of
    September 2018. She therefore submitted that it was plausible that what
    the appellant was saying was  reasonably  likely  to  be  true  if  his
    computer was confiscated and his name was linked to FETO.

33. As to paragraph 5 of the grounds, she submitted that the FTT J  imposed
    her idea of how the organisation would work. The issue was not  whether
    his details would be "annexed" the newspapers delivered but it was  not
    clear that the appellant suggested his details  would  be  annexed  but
    that presumably any organisation the size of FETO would  have  computer
    records of various things. She submitted that it was not clear why  the
    FtTJ would presume his name would not appear on a database somewhere in
    relation to the subscriptions.

34. The FtTJ's finding out [20] was also the subject of  challenge  on  the
    basis that it was not a sustainable finding. It was submitted  that  it
    was not suggested anywhere that it was only those on a  "wanted  list".
    The judge accepted that those were not present in Turkey at the time of
    the coup did not necessarily mean that the Turkish government would not
    still draw the conclusion that he had  been  involved  with  the  Gulen
    movement (see [26]) but the FtTJ returned to the issue of a wanted list
    being determinative of whether someone would be at risk on return.  She
    submitted that this was plainly wrong given the sheer number  of  those
    who have been arrested.

35. Mr McVeety on behalf of the respondent relied upon the Rule 24 response
    filed  on  the  8  October  2019.  He  submitted  that  the  FtTJ  gave
    sustainable reasons for rejecting the appellant's claim to be  involved
    with the Gulen movement and that the judge made findings at  paragraphs
    14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 which when combined  with  the  adverse  findings
    where the judge considered and  rejected  the  arrest  warrant  as  not
    genuine, led to the overall conclusion that he had not given a credible
    or plausible account of being of interest to the  Turkish  authorities.
    The judge was also entitled to reach an overall view of the credibility
    of the claim including the fact that having made an  application  under
    the Ankara agreement (which was refused) the appellant then  overstayed
    and when served with removal papers made an application under article 8
    and only when that was refused was any claim for asylum made.

36. In his oral  submissions,  Mr  McVeety  submitted  that  there  was  no
    inconsistency in the findings of fact made by the judge  at  paragraphs
    14 and 15. At [14] the judge was considering  the  first  part  of  the
    appellant's claim and found  that  his  lack  of  knowledge  about  the
    details of the organisation indicated someone who  was  never  involved
    with the organisation in any meaningful way and that  it  was  unlikely
    that he would be able to persuade people to subscribe to the newspaper.
    The bottom part of paragraph 14 was referring  to  the  appellants  own
    account. When the paragraphs are read together it  is  plain  that  the
    finding made by the judge was that the appellant was  not  involved  in
    the Gulen movement.

37. As to the challenge to paragraph 17, he submitted that the  submissions
    made by Ms Cleghorn applied a "westernised approach" as to what  people
    do in the UK when they are university. However, that missed  the  point
    -the judge was stating that the appellant had not been using the family
    computer and that it would not reveal any links to FETO.

38. As to names on lists, he referred the Tribunal to the CPIN dealing with
    Turkey: military service (September 2018). That made reference  to  the
    government maintaining a sophisticated national  database  of  military
    service, making evasion almost impossible and that once the  government
    is aware of those who have  evaded  military  service  their  name  and
    address is forwarded to the security authorities by the  administrative
    authorities and they  are  authorised  to  begin  a  search  for  those
    persons. Simultaneously the  military  branches  in  question  send  an
    official letter to their address stating that they  have  become  draft
    evaders and they have to apply to their military branch to complete the
    relevant procedures. He submitted that therefore there was a system  in
    place. Against that background, it was open to the judge to  find  that
    he was not on any list and the findings of  the  FtTJ  were  consistent
    with the background.

Ground 2:

39. This ground related to military service. Ms Cleghorn submitted that  it
    had been accepted on behalf of the respondent that  the  appellant  had
    not completed his military service as  reflected  in  the  decision  at
    [10].

40. The background evidence set out in the CPIN  Turkey:  Military  service
    September 2018 at paragraph 7.1 makes reference to the requirement  for
    military service. The appellant  has  not  completed  military  service
    because he left Turkey with a Visa to study English  in  the  UK  which
    expired in 2017. She therefore submitted that he  had  evaded  military
    service as he has not been pursuing education.

41. The grounds made reference to the decision in Sepet v  UK  [2001]  EWCA
    Civ 681 confirming that any person  avoiding  military  service  to  be
    sentenced to a period in prison. The current  CPIN  made  reference  at
    7.5.1 for the evasion of military service to  include  prosecution  and
    either a fine or imprisonment of between one and 36 months.

42. It was submitted on the appellant's behalf that any period of time held
    in prison in Turkey would be  in  breach  of  Article  3.  The  written
    grounds made reference to the February 2016 CPIN which  made  reference
    to  the   prison   facilities   remaining   inadequate,   not   meeting
    international standards, underfunding and lack of  access  to  adequate
    healthcare and overcrowding in some prisons. The written  grounds  make
    reference to the above information being taken prior to the coup.  From
    this  it  was  extrapolated  that  it  meant   that   already   serious
    overcrowding would be exacerbated by the imprisonment of another 50,000
    by the president. Thus it was admitted there was a real risk of Article
    3 harm arising, but the judge failed to engage with that argument.

43. In her oral submissions as Cleghorn pointed to the material at p.7AB in
    support of her submission.

44. Mr McVeety on behalf of the respondent submitted there was no  evidence
    that the appellant had ever been called for military service and  posed
    the question that if that was so why had he  not  been  arrested  given
    that he had left Turkey in 2016 when he was aged 24 and made  reference
    to the CPIN and the methods used by the police and the authorities  who
    have lists of those evading the draft. Given that the information makes
    reference to those who are no longer studying, and the methods used  by
    the authorities to detect those in this position, there is no  evidence
    that has been any attempt to track him down which was supported by  the
    appellant's own evidence that his family would have been aware of this.

45. As to prison conditions, there was no evidence before the FtTJ relating
    to such conditions and in order to demonstrate a breach  of  Article  3
    cogent evidence would be required therefore this was not dealt with  by
    the judge because there was no  such  evidence  to  show  a  breach  of
    Article  3.  Consequently  he  submitted,  the  appellant  is   not   a
    conscientious objector, there is no evidence  whatsoever  that  he  has
    been called for military  service  there  is  nothing  in  his  witness
    statement or the interview and it is possible to  infer  from  his  own
    evidence that he is in contact with his family given  that  the  arrest
    warrant was sent to him but that there was no evidential foundation  to
    establish any risk to him. He submitted that there was no evidence that
    the authorities had been to his home looking for him.

46. Ms Cleghorn by way of reply made reference to his interview at question
    81 where the appellant stated that all males  in  the  age  of  20  did
    military service and that as he was at university between the  ages  of
    20-22 he was able to postpone his military service and as  he  came  to
    the UK he was able to postpone it until 2017. Now he has no legal right
    to postpone it. She submits the issue is what happens  after  2017  and
    that he would be at risk of serious harm on return.



Discussion:

47. I am grateful for the submissions made by each of the advocates  and  I
    have taken into account the matters raised both in the written  grounds
    and in those oral submissions as recorded above. I can  only  interfere
    with a decision of a First-tier Judge if I it has been established that
    the decision involved the making of an error on a point of law.  Having
    considered the submission made in the light of the FtTJ's  decision,  I
    am not satisfied that the decision of the FtTJ involved the  making  of
    an error on a point of law. I shall set out  my  reasons  for  reaching
    that decision below.

48. The grounds challenge the findings made by the FtTJ  at  paragraphs  14
    and 15 on the basis that she had made inconsistent  findings.  However,
    in my judgement the findings of fact should not be  read  in  isolation
    but should be read in their entirety.

49. The FtTJ made the following factual findings:

      1. The FtTJ made reference to his evidence concerning his  involvement
         with FETO and that other than the generalisation  of  praying  five
         times a day, fasting, making donations to people who  needed  help,
         he could give no details about the movement, despite his  claim  to
         have listened to cassettes and  have  sat  around  having  tea  and
         talking about particular things.

      2. The judge made reference to his evidence which related to the  aims
         of the organisation. The FtTJ found that the  appellant's  lack  of
         knowledge about the details of the organisation were indicative  of
         someone who  was  never  involved  with  the  organisation  in  any
         meaningful way and  particularly,  if  he  was  unable  to  provide
         information about the organisation, it was unlikely that  he  would
         be able to persuade people to subscribe to a  newspaper  issued  by
         that movement. The judge found "in my judgement,  his  evidence  is
         that he only involved himself with the ABIs when they  offered  him
         financial or personal gain but was not truly  interested  in  their
         doctrines, aims and objectives" (at [14]).

      3. The judge rejected the appellant's explanation for his  failure  to
         record details about  the  history  of  the  movement.  Whilst  the
         appellant was aware that on special religious days people go to the
         mosque or be invited to houses, the appellant never did either. The
         explanation was that he had not been  involved  with  the  "Ceemat"
         from 2013 - 2016 and this was why he could not recall  any  details
         about the history of  the  movement.  The  judge  found  that  "the
         appellant will be unlikely to forget the history of the movement he
         claims to have believed in and promoted  by  persuading  people  to
         subscribe to their newspaper" (at [15]).

      4. The FtTJ recorded that the appellant did not know the movement  was
         in any other countries or if it owned, ran or was affiliated to any
         other organisation in Turkey. The judge concluded, "this  indicates
         the appellant knows very little about the organisation  and  it  is
         unlikely he was involved with it in anyway."

      5. When considering his history, the judge made reference  to  account
         that in 2013 the appellant returned to his  home  and  had  nothing
         more to do with FETO and did not collect any new subscribers. "This
         would  mean  that  he  lived  and  worked  in  Turkey  as  a  hotel
         receptionist for three years before leaving to travel  to  the  UK"
         (at[16]).

      6. The FtTJ considered the appellant's claim that the authorities  had
         come looking for him. The basis of that claim was that while he was
         at university he actively worked for FETO by finding subscribers to
         the Zaman newspaper and claimed that  there  was  evidence  on  his
         computer that he signed papers in respect of the people he  managed
         to persuade to subscribe to the newspaper. His claim was that there
         would be a trace of his involvement with FETO on their computer  as
         his signature would appear alongside the new subscribers  signature
         to confirm their agreement to purchase the newspaper. The judge did
         not accept that account.

          a)  Firstly, if the appellant was living  in  accommodation  away
             from home, the address that will be found for him would not be
             his family's home address but that of his  accommodation  when
             he was at university and the computer he  would  have  use  of
             that time, could not be  described  as  the  family  computer,
             which is the one he claims was confiscated by the authorities.
             As the appellant lived away from home, the  computer  he  used
             university  would  not  be  shared  with  his   siblings   and
             therefore, the judge did not accept that the computer  in  his
             family home would reveal any links to FETO.

          b)  Secondly, the judge found that  any  FETO  related  financial
             matters would be unlikely to be on the  personal  computer  of
             the appellant and if they did exist, would be  on  a  computer
             controlled by FETO (see [17]).

          c) Thirdly, the appellant's evidence was that a person could  buy
             the Zaman newspaper anywhere but because people did  not  have
             the time to do that it could be  delivered.  The  judge  found
             that any information about subscribers would  not  necessarily
             have to have the name of the person who sold the  subscription
             to them and it there to as their details  would  be  all  that
             will be required to have the newspaper delivered and to obtain
             payment from them. She did not  accept  that  the  appellant's
             name would appear on a  computer  linking  him  to  the  Zaman
             newspaper or FETO.

      7. At [19] the judge made reference to the 2016 coup  that  had  taken
         place in Turkey and that the  president  had  rounded  up  all  the
         academics and civil servants and in particular those  were  members
         of the Gulen movement and it was declared a terrorist  organisation
         although it was not on the UN list as  such.  The  judge  therefore
         considered the appellant's claim against that background.

      8. The judge recorded the position of the respondent in  the  decision
         letter that the appellant would not be of interest to  the  Turkish
         authorities as his name was not  listed  as  someone  suspected  of
         having links with the movement. The respondent did not accept  that
         the arrest warrant that the appellant had  submitted  was  genuine.
         The judge took into account the appellant's evidence that  he  said
         his name was not on a wanted list and believed that his family  had
         heard or saw that it was, they would have told him. The FtTJ  Judge
         therefore concluded that the appellant would not be the subject  of
         treatment described for those  whose  names  appear  on  the  list.
         Therefore if his name was not  on  the  wanted  list  or  not  been
         published in the newspaper, then it was not likely that he would be
         wanted by the Turkish government for any reason.

      9. At paragraphs [21]-[25] the FtTJ set out  her  findings  concerning
         the arrest warrant relied on. The appellant  had  stated  that  the
         warrant was brought to his father's house the day after it had been
         searched by the authorities, his computer  taken,  and  his  father
         arrested. However, the FtTJ  found  that  the  translation  of  the
         warrant stated, "this document is electronically signed and send to
         the address by post in accordance with the Act 5070" and that  this
         was inconsistent with the appellant's oral  evidence  that  it  was
         brought to his father's house (at [21]).

     10. The warrant was also internally inconsistent as the warrant did not
         give an address for the appellant but the original,  shown  to  the
         judge, had a handwritten signature in red ink at the part with  the
         translation states "signed and sealed".

     11. The judge recorded  that  the  information  supplied  with  in  the
         warrant is that it was issued by the court on 8  October  2016  but
         that as he could not be interviewed on 6 November  2016  a  warrant
         was issued for the appellant's arrest that day. The contents of the
         warrant went on to say that it was  not  withdrawn,  the  appellant
         could not be found in his home  and  is  banned  from  leaving  the
         country.  Having  done  so,  she  concluded  that  the  number   of
         discrepancies had led to find the warrant was not genuine and could
         not  be  relied  upon  as  evidence  that  he  was  wanted  by  the
         authorities.

     12. The judge found that the appellant had left Turkey  using  his  own
         passport with a Visa to study English in  the  United  Kingdom  and
         that it would not take "a great deal  of  detective  work  for  the
         authorities to discover this fact and there is no  indication  that
         the authorities do not  keep  an  electronic  record  of  nationals
         leaving the country" (at [23]).

     13. The appellant had failed to mention the  warrant  in  his  PIF  and
         claimed he did not mention it until his asylum interview  for  fear
         of being returned to Turkey or the British government  telling  the
         Turkish government where he is. The judge rejected that explanation
         as credible because at the time the  appellant  had  completed  the
         form, he was well aware of the asylum process and had already  told
         the respondent that he was wanted by the  Turkish  authorities  and
         believed he would be imprisoned. The judge found that the existence
         or  not  of  a  warrant,  would  not  have  prevented  the  British
         authorities from checking the appellant's claim to be wanted  as  a
         member  of  the  movement  should  they  be  intent  on  doing  so.
         Furthermore, the appellant knew in December 2017 that  arrangements
         were being made for him to return to Turkey and in  April  2018  he
         was served with papers as  an  overstayer  so  he  would  know  the
         respondent's intention was to return him to Turkey  and  yet,  even
         against that background, he failed to  mention  that  there  was  a
         warrant  for  his  arrest  outstanding  in  Turkey  or   that   the
         authorities in Turkey suspected him of activities as  a  member  or
         supporter of the movement (at [24]).

     14. The judge considered the envelope provided to her dated 5  November
         2018 (the envelope that was said to have contained the  warrant  is
         sent to  the  appellant).  When  looking  at  the  chronology,  the
         appellant claimed asylum on 12 June 2018 and page 16  of  his  PIF,
         completed on 12 August 2018  there  is  a  section  in  respect  of
         documentation in support of the claim which the appellant had  left
         blank even though he claimed he knew that there was a  warrant  for
         his arrest with his father in Turkey. It was not until a few  weeks
         before the asylum interview that the warrant was posted to him. The
         judge found that the appellant had the document prepared by someone
         in Turkey and sent to him in time for his interview in  an  attempt
         to bolster his claim (at [25]).

     15. The judge found that he could not have  been  active  in  the  coup
         attempt in Turkey in July 2016 as he was in the UK studying at that
         time. However the judge considered that that itself would not  stop
         the government from reaching the conclusion that  if  he  had  been
         involved in the movement while studying in  Turkey,  he  was  still
         opposed to the presidency and the government. However, the  absence
         of his name from any wanted list and the fact that  the  judge  did
         not accept that there was an arrest warrant issued for  his  arrest
         demonstrated  that  he  was  not  being  sought  by   the   Turkish
         authorities nor that it was likely on return he would be  arrested,
         imprisoned and then questioned about allegations  against  him  (at
         [26]).

     16. At paragraph  [28]  the  judge  recorded  the  country  information
         concerning the two-year period of state of emergency which ended in
         July 2018 but that the government continued to use  its  powers  to
         silence cortical voices  and  strip  away  fundamental  rights  and
         freedoms (see Amnesty international  report,  covering  2019).  The
         judge also recorded that as recently in February 2019,  the  public
         prosecutor ordered the detention 1112 people as part of  a  massive
         crackdown targeting followers of the faith-based Gulen movement and
         that the majority of the thousands of people arrested as members or
         suspected members of the movement was civil servants, teachers  and
         members of the judiciary and lawyers. Against that  background  the
         judge made reference to the appellant's employment in  Turkey  from
         2013 - 2016 was as a hotel receptionist. The judge considered  that
         despite his claims to been offered assistance by  FETO  members  to
         become a police officer or to get a job in  the  tourism  ministry,
         neither of the jobs became available to him. The evidence  supplied
         by the appellant in his Visa application forms that his father  was
         assisting with the  funding  his  studies,  his  accommodation  and
         maintenance and the ECO granted this Visa in 2012 and in  2016  and
         was  therefore  satisfied  that  the   information   provided   was
         substantiated.  The  judge  therefore  found  that  there  was   no
         indication the paperwork of any third-party sponsorship and if this
         information was available to the Turkish government, there could be
         no suspicion of  the  appellant  being  funded  by  or  having  any
         involvement with FETO.

     17. At paragraph [29] the FtTJ set out her findings concerning  Section
         8 of the 2004 Act. The judge rejected the appellant's evidence  and
         explanation as to why he had delayed his claim for asylum.

50. The FtTJ made a number of adverse findings of fact concerning the  core
    of the appellant's account as to his historical involvement  with  FETO
    and also his claim that the Turkish authorities  had  become  aware  of
    this leading to the issue of an arrest warrant.

51. Whilst the grounds challenge paragraphs 14  and  15,  it  is  plain  my
    judgement that the FtTJ had reached the conclusion on the evidence that
    the appellant's lack of knowledge of the details of  the  organisation,
    its aims and essential details which were lacking, demonstrated that he
    was someone who had failed to establish that he had  been  involved  in
    the movement. In particular, the judge considered his account that  his
    role was to persuade people to subscribe to the newspaper  but  reached
    the conclusion that if he had no knowledge of the group that it was not
    reasonably likely that he would have been able to undertake such a role
    (see [14]).

52.  The  bottom  of  paragraph  14  highlighted  by  Ms  Cleghorn  is  not
    inconsistent with the FtTJ's earlier  finding  because  the  judge  was
    setting  out  what  the  appellants  evidence  was.  This  is   further
    demonstrated by paragraph 15 where the FtTJ continued her assessment of
    his account and considered his explanation for his  lack  of  knowledge
    concerning the movement.  For  the  reasons  given,  she  rejected  the
    explanation given for his inability to  recall  relevant  details.  The
    judge found that it was not reasonably likely that the appellant  would
    have forgot the history of the movement he claimed to believe in  given
    the factual account he provided of promoting the movement by persuading
    people to subscribe to the newspaper. The judge therefore concluded  at
    [15] "in my judgement, this indicates the appellant knows  very  little
    about the organisation and it is unlikely he was involved  with  it  in
    anyway." This demonstrates  that  there  is  no  inconsistency  in  the
    findings of fact reached as submitted.

53. The grounds also challenge the FtTJ's findings  at  [17].  The  written
    grounds make reference to the use of a university address and that  "no
    one in their right mind would give  halls  of  residence  as  his  home
    address." As Mr McVie submits, this approaches  the  evidence  and  the
    judge's fact-finding from  a  "westernised  UK  perspective".  What  is
    relevant is the evidence before the FtTJ which was referred to at [17].
    It had been stated by the appellant that he actively worked for FETO by
    finding subscribers to the newspaper and and there was evidence on  his
    computer that he signed papers in respect of people he had  managed  to
    persuade. His claim also was  that  there  would  be  a  trace  of  his
    involvement with FETO on their computer as his signature  would  appear
    alongside the name of the new subscriber. The judge recorded that  this
    was the reason given by the  appellant  for  the  authorities  apparent
    interest in him (as evidenced by the arrest warrant).

54. However, on the FtTJ's analysis of the evidence, the computer that  the
    appellant stated he was using was his own  computer  and  was  not  the
    family computer as he was actively using it at university therefore  it
    could not be said to have been confiscated from  the  appellant's  home
    address. It is against this background evidence that the  FtTJ  reached
    the conclusion that the computer at his family home would therefore not
    reveal any links to the appellant.

55. Whilst Ms Cleghorn referred the Tribunal to the country materials  (HRW
    report 2018 Turkey (which I have set out  at  paragraph  32),  this  is
    generalised material referring to journalists and the closure of  media
    outlets. She submits that it is  plausible  that  his  name  was  on  a
    computer that he would be associated with FETO. However that submission
    ignores the findings made by the judge at[17] where the judge  rejected
    that his name was on a computer at the family home and at [18] when the
    judge gave reasons why his name did not appear on  a  computer  linking
    him to the Zaman newspaper or FETO. It also ignores the  findings  made
    in respect of the arrest warrant at paragraph [21 - 25].

56. At [18] the judge  took  into  account  the  appellant's  own  evidence
    relating to how the Zaman newspaper  could  be  purchased  (it  is  the
    largest newspaper in Turkey) and the FtTJ reached the  conclusion  that
    it had not been reasonably explained as to why  information  concerning
    subscribers would have the name of the person who sold the subscription
    either annexed or alongside it given that their details  would  be  all
    that would be required to have the newspaper delivered  and  to  obtain
    payment. The FT TJ therefore gave reasons why she did  not  accept  his
    account that his name would also appear on a computer  linking  him  to
    the newspaper or FETO. The grounds are  simply  disagreement  with  the
    FtTJ' s findings and do not demonstrate any error of law.

57. At paragraph 20 the submissions ignore the entirety of  that  paragraph
    and also the paragraphs that follow thereafter. At [20] the  FtTJ  made
    reference to the respondent's position that the appellant  was  not  of
    interest to the Turkish authorities and  made  reference  not  only  to
    lists held by the government but  also  that  the  respondent  did  not
    accept that the arrest warrant submitted by the appellant was  genuine.
    The FtTJ does not set out the parts of the CPIN referred to  but  there
    was evidence in the country material  referring  to  the  sophisticated
    intelligence systems operated by the Turkish authorities  (in  relation
    to military service see GBTS database and the material  at  7.3.1)  and
    also in the appellant's bundle at page 22 where it was recorded that on
    5 June 2017, a notice was published in the official  Gazette  with  the
    names of 130 individuals residing abroad, summoning them to  return  to
    Turkey and present themselves for  criminal  investigations.  The  FtTJ
    further recorded that the appellant's own evidence was  that  his  name
    was not on any "wanted list" and gave the reason why this was the case,
    namely that if he had been on such a list, the family members with whom
    he was in touch within Turkey would have been aware.

58. It is correct that the country materials  refer  to  large  numbers  of
    people being investigated over  links  with  the  Gulen  movement  (see
    p46AB), however the judge did not consider that any exclusion from  any
    list held would be a  determinative  factor.  The  judge  undertook  an
    analysis of the evidence provided by the appellant to demonstrate  that
    he was in fact under investigation  by  the  submission  of  an  arrest
    warrant. The written grounds raise no challenge against that assessment
    which the judge undertook at paragraph 21  -  25,  applying  well-known
    principles in Tanveer Ahmed by considering both the form,  the  content
    of the document and its provenance. The FtTJ also made findings open to
    her concerning the failure of the appellant to adequately or reasonably
    explain why had made no reference to that document at the relevant time
    (see paragraphs 24 - 25).

59. Other findings made by the judge were at [28) where she made  reference
    to the background material which was also cited in the decision  letter
    concerning those employed in the public sector such as  civil  servants
    had been disproportionately affected by the actions of  the  government
    and also taken against the years 2013 - 2016 where, on the  appellant's
    own case, he was not involved in  any  way  with  FETO,  and  the  Visa
    information. The judge concluded from that evidence that there  was  no
    suspicion of the appellant being funded by  any  other  third-party  or
    having any involvement with FETO.

60. At [29] the judge made a finding concerning section 8 of the  2004  act
    taking into account his immigration history and his delay  in  claiming
    asylum. The judge considered that this, when taken  together,  did  not
    demonstrate someone in fear of  the  government.  The  judge  expressly
    rejected his explanation that asylum was "only from people from African
    countries" and did so in the light of his university education and  his
    background.

61. Taking all of those findings  together,  the  FtTJ  gave  adequate  and
    sustainable reasons for reaching the conclusion that the appellant  was
    not of interest to the Turkish authorities on account  of  any  or  any
    suspected links to the Gulen movement.

62. Dealing with ground 2, and the issue of  national  service,  the  judge
    recorded that the appellant had not completed that national service  at
    [30]. The  country  materials  demonstrated  that  compulsory  national
    service was a prerogative of  sovereign  states  and  that  Turkey  had
    chosen to make all men between the ages of 20 and 41 complete a maximum
    of 12 months military service.  There  were  exemptions  available  and
    people can buyout or delay their military service.  The  FtTJ  recorded
    that the appellant did not claim to be a conscientious objector due  to
    his religion or to be LGBT and therefore the judge found  that  he  did
    not fall into the category of person who would  face  a  real  risk  of
    serious harm or  persecution  by  virtue  of  having  to  complete  his
    national service in Turkey.

63. Whilst Mr McVeety submits that there was no evidence that the appellant
    had been called for military service, I proceed on the basis  that  the
    respondent accepted  that  he  had  not  undertaken  military  service.
    According to the appellant's chronology he was in education  in  Turkey
    when he was 21 years of age and became eligible  for  military  service
    and was therefore exempt on that basis. He left  Turkey  in  2016  when
    approximately 24 years of age as a student and  it  reasonably  follows
    that an exemption was likely to have been granted to him. This was  the
    appellant's evidence in his interview at question 18.

64. The appellant is therefore still eligible for military service  in  the
    light of his age and as set out in the country materials in  the  CPIN.
    However as the FtTJ found on the facts, the appellant was not objecting
    to undertaking military service. Unlike other cases, he did  not  raise
    the issue of conscientious objection either on the basis  of  religion,
    sexuality nor on the  basis  of  the  conditions  of  service.  At  its
    highest, he stated in not particularly welcome it. He  would  therefore
    on return be viewed as someone who was not refusing  to  take  military
    service but was returning to his country of nationality and would  thus
    undertake that service.

65. The objective material set out in the eligibility for military  service
    at 3.2 of the CPIN makes reference to the DFAT report which notes  that
    university students can delay  their  service  until  their  completion
    (3/3.4). There are also "buyout"  options.  The  rule  24  response  is
    incorrect in suggesting that one of the buyout options is available  to
    the appellant because he is not over 38 years of age. However the  CPIN
    also makes reference to a law ratified  by  Parliament  enabling  young
    Turkish men to complete military service in 21  days  instead  of  5  ï¿½
    months by paying a larger sum of money. This does not  refer  to  being
    over 38 years of age but refers to its citizens being born on or before
    January 1, 1994. The appellant's date of birth is recorded as being  on
    or before 1994.

66. The submission made on behalf of the appellant is that he  is  a  draft
    evader and therefore any time spent in prison, whether it  be  for  the
    minimum term would be in breach of Article 3. I can see no reference to
    any argument advanced before the FtTJ in this respect but  even  if  it
    were, the material relied upon in support of those submissions does not
    demonstrate that the prison conditions are in breach of Article 3.  The
    material relied on was highlighted by Ms Clegg as that at page 7 of the
    appellant's bundle. where it was recorded that cases of torture and ill-
    treatment in police custody were widely reported to 2017 especially  by
    individuals detained under the anti-law despite the  government  stated
    zero tolerance of torture policy.  There  were  widespread  reports  of
    police  beating  detainees,  subjecting  them   to   prolonged   stress
    positions. That material  refers  to  police  custody  and  not  prison
    conditions.

67. The CPIN and prison conditions (February 2018) was before the FtTJ  and
    noted that the prison conditions vary widely in Turkey with some  being
    overcrowded and harsh (2.4.1) but by 2017 it was said that a number  of
    new prisons were being built and would be in service. The report  makes
    references to the CPT report also.

68. Since Turkey is a Member State of the Council of Europe  and  there  is
    currently no pilot judgment of the European Court of  Human  Rights  in
    force relating to conditions in its prisons,  the  starting  point  for
    examination of the Article 3 issue is the  presumption  that  a  member
    state will comply with the Convention. The conclusion in  the  CPIN  is
    that  in  general  terms  the  prison  conditions  in  Turkey  are  not
    systematically inhumane or life-threatening to meet  the  threshold  of
    Article 3.

69. I accept the submission made by Mr McVeety, that  the  evidence  relied
    upon by the appellant before the FtTJ does not demonstrate  the  prison
    conditions are in breach of Article 3.

70. Drawing together those conclusions, it has not been  demonstrated  that
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal judge involved the making of an
    error on a point of law. The assessment of appellant's account was  one
    that was reasonably open to the judge to make.
