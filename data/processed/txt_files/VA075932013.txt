                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


Introduction and Background

 1. The Appellant appeals against a determination of  Designated  Judge  of
    the First-tier Tribunal McClure promulgated on 31st January 2014.

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of  Bangladesh,  born  6th  April  1985  who
    applied for entry clearance to the United Kingdom  as  a  visitor.   He
    indicated that he wished to visit his grandfather for a period  of  two
    months.

 3. The application was refused  on  24th  March  2013  with  reference  to
    paragraph 41 of the Immigration Rules.  The Respondent did  not  accept
    that the Appellant was genuinely seeking entry to the United Kingdom as
    a visitor for a limited period as claimed,  nor  that  he  intended  to
    leave the United Kingdom at the end  of  the  visit,  and  it  was  not
    accepted that the Appellant had proved that he could meet the cost of a
    return  or  onward  journey.   The  Respondent  therefore  relied  upon
    paragraph 41(i), (ii) and (vii) in refusing the application.

 4. The Appellant's appeal was heard by Judge McClure (the judge)  on  24th
    December  2013.   The  judge  heard  evidence  from   the   Appellant's
    grandfather Hobibur Rahman  and  considered  a  substantial  bundle  of
    documents submitted on behalf of the Appellant.   The  judge  dismissed
    the appeal, not being satisfied that the Appellant intended a visit  to
    the United Kingdom for the period stated, or that he  would  leave  the
    United Kingdom at the end of the visit.  The judge  was  not  satisfied
    that the Appellant could be adequately maintained and  accommodated  in
    the United Kingdom.

 5. The Appellant applied for permission to appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal
    which was granted in the following terms by Designated Judge French;

    1.   The Appellant  applies  in  time  for  permission  to  appeal  the
         decision of Designated Judge McClure to dismiss his appeal  against
         refusal of entry clearance as a visitor.
    2.   In the grounds it is argued that the judge erred in  not  stating,
         and not applying, the correct standard of proof, that he failed  to
         take account of all relevant evidence and that  his  findings  were
         unreasonable and irrational.
    3.   The judge gave various reasons why he found that the Appellant had
         not established  that  his  circumstances  in  Bangladesh  were  as
         claimed and there is no indication that he applied  anything  other
         than the correct burden and standard.  It is however arguable  that
         he may have erred in not making express findings on the evidence of
         the Sponsor, the Appellant's grandfather, and in making findings on
         the proposed accommodation and  maintenance  arrangements  in  this
         country when these issues had not been raised by the Respondent and
         there is no indication that they were relied on by  the  Presenting
         Officer at the hearing.
    4.   Whilst many of the matters raised in the grounds by the  Appellant
         appear to have little potential merit, in the light of the guidance
         in Ferrer (limited grounds of appeal; Alvi) [2012] UKUT 00304 (IAC)
         permission is granted on all grounds.

 6. Following the grant of permission  the  Respondent  lodged  a  response
    pursuant to rule 24 of The Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 contending, in  summary,  that  the  judge  had  directed  himself
    appropriately and adequately considered all relevant matters.

 7. Directions were subsequently issued making provision for there to be  a
    hearing before the Upper Tribunal  to  decide  whether  the  First-tier
    Tribunal determination should be set aside.

The Appellant's Submissions

 8. At the hearing before me Mr Noor relied and expanded upon  the  grounds
    contained within the application  for  permission  to  appeal.   I  was
    advised that if the decision was set aside, Mr Noor wished to  make  an
    application to submit further documentation under rule  15(2A)  of  The
    Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008  and  submit  further
    documents that were not before the First-tier Tribunal, although it was
    accepted that this was not relevant to my  consideration  of  error  of
    law.  The Grounds of Appeal are summarised below.

Ground One

 9. The judge misdirected himself in law by failing to  apply  the  correct
    burden and standard of proof.

Ground Two

10. The judge failed to take into account all relevant evidence:

      i) At paragraph 13 the judge had found there was no  evidence  of  any
         income regarding Polli Electronics but had ignored the Islami  Bank
         statements at pages 20-22 of the Appellant's bundle ( the AB).

     ii) At paragraph 14 the judge had found  that  in  part  the  Appellant
         intended to pay for the cost of travel and his holiday relying upon
         the bank account of Polli-Multipurpose Society and had ignored  the
         Appellant's personal bank statements contained at  pages  23-26  of
         the AB.

    iii) It was contended that the judge was inaccurate at paragraph  20  in
         recording that the only  evidence  of  transactions  undertaken  by
         Polli-Multipurpose  Co-operative  appear  to  be  payments  to  the
         Appellant on a monthly basis.

     iv) The judge noted at paragraph 29 the bank accounts belonging to  the
         Appellant appear to have a very modest balance, with the  exception
         of a large deposit in January, and it was contended that the  judge
         had not taken into account the Appellant's personal bank  statement
         at page 26 of the AB where there was a balance of 268,447.60 BDT on
         30th December 2012.

      v) The Appellant had provided  evidence  of  his  claimed  studies  at
         Metropolitan Law College by way of a  letter  dated  25th  February
         2013.  The judge had  found  that  this  did  not  prove  that  the
         Appellant was studying during the academic session 2012/2013 and it
         was  contended  that  the  judge  had  failed  to  distinguish  the
         difference between 'academic session' and 'academic year'  in  that
         an academic session remained the same  until  a  student  completed
         their course of studies.

     vi) The judge had raised the issue of maintenance and accommodation  in
         his determination when this had not  been  raised  in  the  refusal
         notice and this was not raised at the hearing.

Ground Three

11. The judge's findings were unreasonable or irrational  and  no  decision
    maker presented with the  evidence,  could  properly  have  made  those
    findings.  The judge had given excessive weight as to how  many  people
    from  the  Appellant's  family  had  made  an  application  for   entry
    clearance, and had not made any findings regarding the  credibility  of
    Mr Rahman.

The Respondent's Submissions

12. Mr Harrison contended that the determination is clear and thorough  and
    the judge had considered all the evidence that was before him and  made
    findings which were open to him to make in view of  the  evidence.   Mr
    Harrison submitted that the weight to be attached to the evidence was a
    matter for the judge.

13. Mr Harrison pointed out that in paragraph 7 of  the  determination  the
    judge had noted that five people from the same family were applying for
    entry clearance at the same time,  and  taken  into  account  that  the
    members of the family who had visited,  had  stayed  longer  than  they
    initially indicated.  One of those people was a minor who had  been  in
    the United Kingdom for approximately six months, when he was of  school
    age.

14. Mr Harrison contended that  the  grounds  amounted  to  an  attempt  to
    reargue the case and did not disclose a material error of  law  in  the
    determination.

The Appellant's Response

15. In relation to the point made by the judge that there had been a  large
    deposit of funds in January, Mr Noor submitted that an explanation  had
    been given for this, which was  reasonable,  and  that  prior  to  that
    deposit there  were  substantial  funds  in  the  Appellant's  personal
    account.  I was asked to note that  the  Entry  Clearance  Manager  had
    withdrawn the refusal decision for some of the  other  family  members,
    and there was reference to the withdrawal of one appeal in paragraph  2
    of the determination.

16. At the conclusion of oral submissions I reserved my decision.

My Conclusions and Reasons

17. I will refer to the grounds as they are set out in the application  for
    permission to appeal.

Ground One

18. Having carefully considered the determination I can find no  indication
    that the judge applied an incorrect standard or  burden  of  proof.   I
    find no error of law on this issue.



Ground Two

19. Weight to be given to evidence is a matter for the judge  hearing  that
    evidence, provided  the  judge  does  not  give  weight  to  immaterial
    matters, or fail to take into account material evidence.  I do not find
    that the judge has fallen into  material  error  when  considering  the
    evidence.

      i) In relation to  Polli  Electronics,  the  judge  does  not  err  in
         recording that there is no evidence of income, in that  no  company
         profit and loss accounts were produced.  A bank  statement  of  the
         company  does  show  that  there  are  cash   deposits   and   cash
         withdrawals.  In my view the judge when  referring  to  a  lack  of
         evidence of income, was referring to the lack of  profit  and  loss
         accounts, showing the income and outgoings of the company.

     ii) At paragraph 14 of the determination the judge  correctly  recorded
         that the Appellant relied in part upon the bank statements of Polli-
         Multipurpose Co-operative Society and that there  was  no  evidence
         that the funds in  that  account  were  available  purely  for  the
         Appellant to pay for a holiday.   The  judge  was  aware  that  the
         Appellant had submitted other bank statements and in this paragraph
         was dealing with the Polli-Multipurpose Cooperative Society and did
         not err in so doing.

    iii) The judge at paragraph 20 did not err in not being  satisfied  that
         the Appellant was entitled to  use  money  from  Polli-Multipurpose
         Cooperative to finance a holiday in  the  United  Kingdom,  on  the
         basis that other individuals were involved in the running  of  that
         business.  The judge erred in finding that the only evidence of any
         transactions  being  undertaken  appear  to  be  payments  to   the
         Appellant on a monthly basis, as the statement at pages 27-32  show
         numerous deposits and withdrawals by a number of  individuals,  not
         only the Appellant.  This however is not  in  my  view  a  material
         error, the point that the judge was making, was  that  he  was  not
         satisfied that the Appellant would be able to use the funds in that
         account, because the funds were not  under  his  sole  control  but
         other people were involved, according to the Appellant's claim.

     iv) The judge erred in recording in paragraph 29 that leaving aside the
         large deposit in January,  there  appeared  to  be  a  very  modest
         balance in the Appellant's account, as his personal  account  shown
         at page 26 of the AB indicated  a  balance  of  268,447.60  BDT  at
         30th December 2012 which I accept amounts to approximately �2,255.



      v) I do not accept that the judge erred in his  consideration  of  the
         Metropolitan Law College letter  dated  25th  February  2013.   The
         judge was perfectly entitled to find that the letter which referred
         to the academic session 2011-2012, did not prove that the Appellant
         was studying in the academic session 2012-2013.

     vi) The judge was entitled to consider  maintenance  and  accommodation
         even if these matters  were  not  raised  in  the  refusal  notice,
         provided that the Appellant was  given  notice  of  this,  and  the
         opportunity to answer any concerns.  I accept that maintenance  and
         accommodation were not raised in the refusal  notice,  nor  in  the
         Respondent's review, but I do not find that  the  judge  materially
         erred on this  issue,  as  it  is  quite  clear  from  reading  the
         determination that the main focus of the judge, and the main reason
         for dismissing the appeal, was because he was  not  satisfied  that
         the Appellant had discharged the burden of proof in relation to his
         intention  to  visit  the  United  Kingdom  and  to  leave  at  the
         conclusion of the visit.

Ground Three

20. There is a high threshold for irrationality, and I do not consider  the
    findings made  by  the  judge  can  be  properly  described  as  either
    irrational or unreasonable.

21. I set out below paragraph 30 of the determination which summarises  the
    findings made by the judge;

    30.  Taking all the matters into account I am not  satisfied  that  the
         Appellant has such commitments in his home country as  would  cause
         him to return there.  There is no evidence that  the  Appellant  is
         presently studying.  There is no  statement  of  income  confirming
         earnings from the businesses that he appears to be running.   There
         is no indication of the  profits  being  made  by  the  businesses.
         There is no indication of any monies that he is earning within  the
         businesses.  The Appellant is single; is not in  education;  it  is
         unclear how he is earning his living.   Taking  all  those  matters
         into account I am not satisfied that the Appellant has such social,
         family or other ties within Bangladesh as would cause him to return
         there.  I am not satisfied that the Appellant is coming to  the  UK
         for the period stated or that the Appellant will leave  the  UK  at
         the end of any period provided for in a visa.

22. The judge was entitled to reach the conclusions set out above.   In  my
    view there was no satisfactory evidence before the judge, to prove on a
    balance of probabilities that the Appellant was studying.  There was no
    satisfactory evidence of the income that he claimed to  earn  from  two
    separate businesses.  There were no accounts for those businesses.  The
    judge was aware, and was entitled to take into account that five people
    from the same family had applied at the same time to visit  the  United
    Kingdom and he took into account  that  an  appeal  by  another  family
    member had resulted in the Respondent withdrawing that decision.  These
    were all matters that the judge took into  account  before  reaching  a
    conclusion.

23. The judge  examined  the  evidence  presented  to  him,  and  noted  in
    paragraph 15 of the determination that an income  tax  certificate  had
    been submitted on behalf of the Appellant, and he recorded the numerous
    deficiencies in that document.

24. In relation to Mr Rahman's evidence, the judge makes reference to  this
    in paragraphs 7-12, and also at paragraphs 23 and  28  in  relation  to
    accommodation.  I am satisfied from  reading  the  determination  as  a
    whole that the judge took into account Mr Rahman's evidence, but  found
    that he could not discharge the burden of  proof  in  relation  to  the
    Appellant's circumstances in Bangladesh, which were  one  of  the  main
    issues in the appeal.  There was no evidence from Mr Rahman that he had
    visited the Appellant in Bangladesh recently or at all.  Mr Rahman  did
    not mention visiting Bangladesh in his witness  statement.   The  issue
    before the judge related to the intention of  the  Appellant,  not  the
    intention of Mr Rahman.  I do not find that the judge materially  erred
    in relation to Mr Rahman's evidence.

25. The judge was entitled to find that the Appellant  had  not  discharged
    the burden of proof, having weighed up all that was  before  him.   The
    grounds amount to a disagreement with the findings made by  the  judge,
    but do not disclose a material error of law.

Decision

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.

I do not set aside the decision.  The appeal is dismissed.

Anonymity

No order for anonymity was made by the First-tier Tribunal.  There has  been
no request for anonymity and the Upper Tribunal makes  no  anonymity  order.
