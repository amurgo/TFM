Representation:
For the Appellant:     Miss Mottershaw, Counsel, instructed by GMIU
For the Respondent:    Mr Bates, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. I extend the anonymity order under Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
    (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 and direct that unless and until a Tribunal
    or court directs otherwise, the  appellant  is  granted  anonymity.  No
    report of these proceedings shall directly or indirectly  identify  her
    or any member of  her  family.  This  direction  applies  both  to  the
    appellant and to the respondent. Failure to comply with this  direction
    could lead to contempt of court proceedings.

 2. The appellant is an Iranian national. On October 24,  2014  he  applied
    for asylum but his application was refused on April 5, 2016.

 3. The appellant lodged grounds of  appeal  under  Section  82(1)  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 on April  26,  2016.   His
    appeal came before Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Raikes (hereinafter
    called "the Judge") on May 9, 2017 and in a decision promulgated on May
    30, 2017 the Judge refused his appeal on all grounds.

 4. The appellant appealed the decision on June  13,  2017.  Permission  to
    appeal was initially  refused  by  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Chamberlain on September 19, 2017. Those grounds were  renewed  and  on
    November 9, 2017 Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Taylor found  it  arguable
    the Judge may have erred by failing to provide adequate  reasons  on  a
    number of matters.

 5. The respondent filed a Rule 24 response dated December 8, 2017 in which
    she opposed the setting aside of the decision.

 6. The matter came before me on  the  above  date  and  the  parties  were
    represented as set out above.

    SUBMISSIONS

 7. Miss Mottershaw adopted  the  grounds  of  appeal  and  submitted  that
    cumulatively there was an error in law.

 8. The Judge found that the appellant had referred to  "the  computer"  as
    his computer but had later referred to it as his mother's computer. The
    Judge failed to have regard to the appellant's  witness  statements  in
    which he made it clear that the computer was a shared computer and that
    reference to his and hers did not reflect actual ownership.

 9. The Judge concluded that it lacked credibility his aunt and  uncle  had
    not been approached despite their photographs being  on  the  computer.
    She submitted that the  authorities  would  not  have  identified  them
    merely from the photographs and therefore they would not  have  located
    them. The difference between his "aunt and uncle" and  his  mother  was
    that the appellant and her had taken the computer to a repair shop  and
    it was from an examination of the computer  the  intelligence  services
    obtained the photographs. The Judge was  therefore  wrong  to  find  it
    wholly implausible that his aunt and  uncle  were  not  identified  and
    spoken to.

10. The Judge criticised video footage which showed the  exact  same  scene
    but failed to take into account  that  a  number  of  individuals  were
    present who also photographed and videoed the incident.

11. The Judge stated that the two photographs did not identify the  witness
    because they were taken of his back or when he  had  his  side  to  the
    camera. The  Judge  overlooked  a  further  picture  which  showed  the
    witness's facial features clearly and this amounted to an error.

12. The Judge did not have full regard to the appellant's age when  he  was
    interviewed or consider whether that he had understood questions put to
    him in his interview. Miss Mottershaw submitted the Judge  should  have
    considered whether any inconsistencies could be explained by his  young
    age and should have ensured that the appellant had understood  all  the
    questions in his interview.

13. The Judge had before her an expert report from Dr Kakhki but failed  to
    adequately consider that report and whether the appellant would  be  at
    risk.

14. Mr  Bates  opposed  the  application.  The  Judge  had  considered  the
    photographs that were found on the computer and he submitted that  this
    ground of appeal did not go to the core of the claim. The issue was not
    whose computer it was but that the appellant had provided two different
    accounts about the computer and the timing of when he  and  his  mother
    encountered problems. Taken together the Judge was entitled to make the
    findings she did in paragraphs 26 and 27 of her decision.

15. The Judge considered the evidence regarding the  appellant's  aunt  and
    uncle and the findings she made in paragraph 29 of  her  decision  were
    not implausible and were open to her. The appellant  had  claimed  that
    his mother was on the radar  of  the  authorities,  so  the  Judge  was
    entitled to consider how she was  able  to  wander  off  and  meet  her
    husband  who  was  supposed  to  be  a  member  of  PJAK.  The  Iranian
    authorities are known for  their  interrogation  methods  and  are  not
    adverse to locating family members. The Judge's findings were  open  to
    her.

16. The Judge considered the evidence presented and concluded that as  PJAK
    did not allow the videoing of events  that  it  was  unlikely  so  many
    people would have been videoing the same  incident  as  was  now  being
    argued. In any event, there was no evidence apart from  that  given  by
    the appellant that the  male  identified  by  him  as  his  father  was
    actually his father. The witness who attended the hearing was unable to
    confirm they were related. The  Judge  ultimately  concluded  that  the
    appellant had not attended the camp.

17. Whilst he was a minor when he attended his screening interview  he  was
    nevertheless over the age  of  17  and  he  had  signed  the  screening
    interview and been provided with a copy. He  was  represented  when  he
    attended his substantive interview and there  is  no  evidence  in  the
    interview that either the appellant or his  legal  representative  were
    unhappy with the conduct of  that  interview.  He  submitted  that  the
    appellant's age and  the  submission  that  he  was  unhappy  with  his
    interview  content  did  not  have  any  merit.  At  the  time  of  his
    substantive interview he was no longer a minor  and  was  almost  18  ï¿½
    years of age.

18. Mr Bates invited me to  reject  the  application  but  Miss  Mottershaw
    submitted that five of  the  ten  inconsistencies,  identified  by  the
    Judge, had been challenged and this supported her claim that there  was
    an error in law. She relied on the cases of AT (Guinea) [2006] EWCA Civ
    1889 and AM (Afghanistan) and the  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2017] EWCA Civ 1123.

    CONSIDERATION AND FINDINGS

19. In considering the appellant's appeal the Judge had regard to the Joint
    Presidential Guidance Note number 2 of 2010  "Child,  Vulnerable  Adult
    and Sensitive Appellant Guidance". This document provides  the  correct
    approach when dealing with a  child  or  vulnerable  adult.  The  Judge
    specifically noted at paragraph 2 of her decision that she  had  regard
    to this document. The Judge also made clear that she had had regard  to
    the  various  bundles  that  had  been  submitted  by  the  appellant's
    representatives between October 14, 2016 and May 2, 2017. The Judge was
    aware of the expert report of Dr Kakhki and the witness  statements  of
    both the appellant and his witness, DM.

20. The Judge noted ten inconsistencies in the appellant's evidence and the
    grounds of  appeal  challenged  five  of  those  inconsistencies.  Miss
    Mottershaw agreed that  the  remaining  inconsistencies  had  not  been
    challenged but argued that the matters raised by her were material  and
    undermined the Judge's findings.

21. In reaching her final decision the Judge made it  clear  that  she  had
    compared the oral evidence with the previous accounts provided  by  the
    appellant in his statements and interview.

22. Key to the appellant's claim was the seizure of a  computer  which  was
    said to have contained photographs of the appellant and others  dressed
    in PJAK uniform. The Judge noted in the appellant's screening interview
    that the appellant claimed the  photographs  were  stored  on  his  own
    computer although later in the same interview he claimed  that  it  was
    his mother's computer.  The  appellant  subsequently  stated  that  the
    computer was shared and there was no difference in his  own  mind.  The
    appellant did not suggest that his answer had been incorrectly recorded
    but simply that he meant the computer was shared.  This  was  something
    the appellant sought to clarify in his statement and formed  the  first
    ground of appeal.

23. If the Judge had only rejected the appellant's  appeal  based  on  this
    purported inconsistency then I am in no doubt that would have  amounted
    to a potential error in law but this was not the only  basis  on  which
    the Judge rejected the claim. The Judge noted the inconsistency and  it
    was one of ten inconsistencies that the Judge found.

24. A second highlighted inconsistency concerned what  was  recovered  from
    the computer. The appellant, in his screening interview, stated it  was
    the technician who had reported the  photographs  to  the  intelligence
    services and thereafter rang his mother the following day  whereas  the
    appellant later claimed the technician had rung his  mother  to  inform
    her that the intelligence services had taken the computer  as  distinct
    to  the  technician  reporting  the  photographs  to  the  intelligence
    services. This inconsistency does not appear to have been challenged in
    the grounds of appeal but was one of the factors relied on by the Judge
    to find the appellant's claim to lack credibility.

25. There was also inconsistency surrounding the timing of  the  report  to
    the authorities with the appellant claiming  in  his  asylum  interview
    that the problems occurred around two months after they  returned  from
    the mountains whereas in his statement, dated September  10,  2015,  he
    stated it was four months after  his  claimed  returned  visit  to  his
    father.

26. The grounds of appeal took issue with the fact that the appellant was a
    minor at his screening interview and his substantive interview was  not
    fully  understood.  There  is  nothing  contained  in  his  substantive
    interview that supports Miss Mottershaw's  submission  that  the  Judge
    erred in with regard to either interview. The Judge made it clear  that
    he had  regard  to  the  Presidential  Guidance  when  considering  his
    evidence. The appellant was not a young teenager but was in fact almost
    an adult when  he  underwent  his  screening  interview.  He  was  also
    represented by a legal representative during his substantive interview.
    No issue was raised at the time of the interview.

27. Turning to the issue of the photographs that were found on the computer
    the appellant claimed that his mother, and, uncle and himself were  all
    pictured in PJAK clothes. Miss Mottershaw submitted that the Judge  was
    wrong to  make  an  adverse  finding  concerning  the  failure  of  the
    authorities to interview his aunt and uncle but the Judge in paragraphs
    29 to 33 dealt with this issue and explained why he made  that  adverse
    finding. Miss Mottershaw's  submission  on  this  issue  amounts  to  a
    disagreement with the Judge's conclusion.  Her  conclusion  is  neither
    irrational nor inadequate.

28. Miss Mottershaw challenged the fact that the photographs relied  on  by
    the appellant showed  exactly  the  same  scene  sent  by  a  different
    witness. The grounds submit that more than one person could have  taken
    the same picture but  again  the  Judge  considered  the  evidence  and
    concluded at paragraph 35  that  it  lacked  credibility  that  firstly
    someone else would have the identical video  and  secondly,  given  the
    security in place at such meetings, that  videoing  would  freely  have
    taken place. Miss  Mottershaw's  submission  on  this  issue  similarly
    amounts to a disagreement.

29. At paragraph 38 of his decision the Judge addressed  photographs  which
    purported to identify the witness in the same camp and at the same time
    as the appellant. The Judge clearly reviewed all the photographs as  he
    refers to them in her decision.

30.  The  Judge  made  the  finding  that  the  appellant  had  stated  the
    photographs were taken by his aunt and uncle as against the witness who
    claimed to have taken. The Judge  applied  the  principles  of  Tanveer
    Ahmed and rejected them as being self-serving and designed  to  support
    his claim. At paragraph 39 the Judge concluded that given the  lack  of
    evidence as to the origin  and  absence  of  any  evidence  as  to  his
    friend's ability, or method, of source and together with  the  lack  of
    evidence in respect of the appellant's father that she could attach  no
    weight to the photographs.

31. Miss Mottershaw also challenged the  Judge's  approach  to  the  expert
    report of Dr Kakhki. The Judge considered this report and the treatment
    of Kurds by the Iranian authorities. The Judge was satisfied  that  the
    country guidance decision SSH  and  HR  (illegal  exit:  failed  asylum
    seeker) CG [2016] UKUT 308 (IAC) had considered the issues being raised
    and she also had regard to the additional objective evidence  that  had
    been submitted. She considered the expert's conclusion at paragraph  44
    and stated that she saw no reason to depart from the  country  guidance
    case on the basis of this report  in  view  the  fact  the  expert  had
    actually given evidence to the Tribunal.

32. Ultimately this case was about credibility and  this  was  not  a  case
    which turned on one particular point but was a  case  where  the  Judge
    identified  numerous   matters   which   she   found   either   to   be
    inconsistencies or implausible. Those findings were open to the Judge.

33. I do not therefore find any error of law on the issues raised  in  this
    appeal.

    DECISION

34. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law.  I uphold the decision.
