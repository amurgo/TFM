    Representation:
    For the Appellant: Mr Avery (Home Office Presenting Officer)
    For the Respondent:     Mr Lewis, Counsel, instructed by Davidson
    Morris Limited


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. Whereas the original respondent is the appealing party, I shall, in the
    interests of convenience and consistency, replicate the nomenclature of
    the decision at first instance.

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of the United States of America. On June 21,
    2012 he applied for entry clearance to settle in the UK as a spouse. He
    and his wife had met in  2001  and  they  married  in  August  2002  in
    Scotland and between August 2002 and August 2005 he  travelled  to  the
    United Kingdom then in August, September and November  2002,  May  2003
    and November 2005. They then lived together in Hawaii  for  6  ï¿½  years
    before his wife returned to the United Kingdom to run a profitable farm
    business she had purchased in 2009. The  respondent  initially  refused
    the appellant's application on August 3, 2012 under paragraphs  320(18)
    and (19) HC 395.  The  matter  came  before  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Thew on July 3, 2013 and she remitted the decision back to the
    respondent to consider whether  it  was  appropriate  to  exercise  her
    discretion in light of the compassionate circumstances she had found.

 3. The respondent reviewed the application but refused the application  on
    December 6, 2013.

 4. The appellant appealed that decision on January  6,  2014,  2014  under
    section 82(1) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  The
    matter  came  before  Judge  of   the   First-tier   Tribunal   Canavan
    (hereinafter referred to as the "FtTJ") on  June  26,  2014  and  in  a
    decision promulgated on July 8, 2014 she allowed the appeal under  both
    the Immigration Rules and Article 8 ECHR.

 5. The respondent lodged grounds of appeal on August 12,  2014  submitting
    the FtTJ had erred by considering the appeal  under  paragraph  320(18)
    and (19) when the decision was confined to Paragraph  320(19)  and  she
    had also erred in her approach to  Article  8  ECHR.  The  matter  came
    before Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Simpson on  November  21,  2014
    and she found there was no error in law. The  grounds  of  appeal  were
    renewed on December 18, 2014 and Upper Tribunal Judge Kekic found there
    was an arguable error in law.

 6. The matter came before me on  the  above  date  and  the  parties  were
    represented as set out above.

 7. The First-tier  Tribunal  did  not  make  an  anonymity  direction  and
    pursuant to Rule 14 of The Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 and I see no reason to alter that order

SUBMISSIONS ON ERROR IN LAW

 8. Mr Avery submitted the FtTJ erred  by  failing  to  make  a  ruling  on
    whether the respondent's decision was unlawful. He submitted  that  she
    had to do this  before  she  could  consider  if  discretion  had  been
    exercised correctly. The FtTJ based her findings on what  the  previous
    judge had found  following  an  earlier  hearing  and  failed  to  make
    substantive findings. The FtTJ  failed  to  have  full  regard  to  the
    serious history of offending and limited her assessment to  the  public
    interest to the risk of re-offending whereas this issue was whether his
    admittance was conducive to the public  interest.  The  FtTJ  erred  by
    failing to engage with the public interest issue and treated the appeal
    as if Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Thew's findings were binding.

 9. Mr Lewis submitted the original determination was fundamental  in  this
    appeal because Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal  Thew  had  the  same
    information before her and made it clear that if all  of  the  evidence
    had been before her she would have  allowed  the  appeal  but  she  was
    constrained by the fact some of the evidence  post-dated  the  date  of
    decision. The respondent had failed to properly consider  the  evidence
    that had been submitted and the FtTJ was  entitled  to  find  that  the
    respondent should  have  exercised  her  discretion  differently  under
    paragraph 320(19). Although paragraph 320(18) was  not  raised  in  the
    refusal letter there was no material error because  firstly  the  Entry
    Clearance Manager had reviewed  the  appeal  after  the  appellant  had
    appealed and "concluded that a refusal  under  paragraphs  320(18)  and
    (19) was still appropriate." The FtTJ did adopt many of  the  Judge  of
    the First-tier Tribunal Thew's findings but the FtTJ made it clear that
    this was her starting point. In paragraph [18] of her determination she
    accepted the circumstances relating to the  sponsor's  health  and  her
    ability to obtain adequate health insurance and lifesaving treatment in
    the USA, the need for the sponsor to care for her parents all  amounted
    to "strong compassionate circumstances". She made it clear that serious
    past convictions can weigh in the public interest in refusing entry but
    this concern could be outweighed by  compassionate  circumstances.  The
    FtTJ considered all the facts and made a finding open to her.

10. I reserved my decision.

CONSIDERATION AND FINDING ON MATERIAL ERROR OF LAW

11. The respondent had been  granted  permission  to  appeal  albeit  Upper
    Tribunal Judge Kekic erroneously referred to the respondent's  decision
    as being under paragraph 320(20 HC 395 when in fact  the  Tribunal  was
    concerned with paragraph 320(19). Although Mr Avery raised  this  as  a
    preliminary issue it was not a matter he pursued any further.

12. The appellant succeeded in his appeal primarily because two  Judges  of
    the First-tier Tribunal found in his favour. Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Thew sent the decision back  to  the  respondent  to  consider
    compassionate  circumstances  that  had  not  been  before   her.   The
    respondent appealed that decision but she  lost  her  appeal.  A  fresh
    refusal letter was issued and simply said  those  circumstances  should
    have been made in a separate application. She  did  not  consider  this
    evidence under the Rules but briefly considered it under Article 8 ECHR
    and concluded, "... I am satisfied that the interference with Article 8
    is not disproportionate given your criminal history."

13. Mr Avery criticised the FtTJ for her approach to the issue  of  whether
    the exclusion of the person from the United Kingdom is conducive to the
    public good. He argued that the FtTJ only had regard to the age of  the
    convictions and the lack of offending since his release in 2001.

14.  Any  proper  reading  of  the  determination  reveals  that  the  FtTJ
    considered a number of factors in the determination.  She  agreed  with
    the findings of Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Thew who had heard all
    of the evidence previously. She did not dissent from the  position  she
    adopted but the FtTJ went on to consider what had happened since.  This
    is demonstrated in paragraphs [14], [18], [19], [20] and  [21]  of  her
    determination.

15. The decision to  allow  the  appeal  was  not  based  on  risk  of  re-
    conviction. The FtTJ had regard to the serious nature of  the  offences
    but took on board what Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Thew  found  as
    was recorded in  paragraph  [7]  of  the  determination.  She  reminded
    herself about the "public interest" in paragraph [19] and in  paragraph
    [20] she agreed there were strong compassionate circumstances and these
    were the factors that had originally been before Judge  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Thew and had been placed before the respondent  prior  to
    the latest decision.

16. Mr Avery submits that by allowing the appeal  under  paragraph  320(18)
    the  FtTJ  erred  but  this  submission  overlooks  the  fact  the  ECM
    reiterated the refusal under this paragraph in her review. The argument
    has no basis in any event because the FtTJ went on in paragraph [21] to
    allow the appeal under paragraph 320(19). She had regard  not  only  to
    his lack of convictions but all of the evidence submitted  relating  to
    his character, conduct and associations. She concluded  her  assessment
    finding there was no evidence to suggest his entry to the UK was likely
    to be detrimental to the public order in preventing disorder and crime.



17. The FtTJ accepted a lawful  decision  had  been  taken  but  found  the
    respondent had not exercised her discretion  reasonably.  That  finding
    was open to the FtTJ and no error of law is made out.

18. Mr Avery did not address me separately on Article 8 and it seems to  me
    that  the  challenge  to  that  decision  falls  once  the  substantive
    application has been allowed. I therefore find no error in law  in  the
    way the FtTJ dealt with Article 8 ECHR.

DECISION

19. There was no material error. I uphold the FtTJ's decision.
