                            DECISION AND REASONS

Anonymity order
The First-tier Tribunal made an order pursuant to Rule 13  of  the  Tribunal
Procedure (First-tier  Tribunal)  (Immigration  and  Asylum  Chamber)  Rules
2014.  I continue that order pursuant to Rule 14 of the  Tribunal  Procedure
(Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008: unless the Upper Tribunal or  a  Court  directs
otherwise, no report  of  these  proceedings  or  any  form  of  publication
thereof  shall  identify  the  original  appellant,  whether   directly   or
indirectly. This order applies to, amongst others, all parties. Any  failure
to comply with this order could give rise to contempt of court proceedings.

Decision and reasons

1. The appellant appeals with permission against the decision of the  First-
   tier Tribunal dismissing his appeal against the respondent's decision  to
   refuse him refugee  protection,  humanitarian  protection,  or  leave  to
   remain in the United Kingdom on human rights grounds.

2. The appellant's nationality is in issue: he claimed to be  a  citizen  of
   Eritrea but the respondent considered him to  be  entitled  to  Ethiopian
   citizenship, if not already registered as an Ethiopian citizen.

Background

3. The appellant says he was born in October  2000  in  Eritrea  to  parents
   both of whom were Eritrean citizens, but that  he  and  his  mother  left
   Eritrea for Ethiopia in 2006, when he was 6  years  old.   The  appellant
   could not remember much about Eritrea, not even what his father's  police
   uniform looked like.  He does not remember why they left, but his  mother
   told him later that the appellant's father was  having  problems  in  his
   employment as a police officer in Eritrea. His father remained behind and
   the appellant was told by relatives  that  he  died  in  2008,  when  the
   appellant was 8 years old.

4. In Ethiopia, the appellant and his mother lived  for  the  next  6  years
   with a paternal or maternal uncle.   The appellant said it was  difficult
   for him to go to school in Ethiopia, but that he was able to  study  from
   grades 1-5 in a fee-paying Ethiopian school,  his  mother  working  as  a
   baker and paying their Ethiopian landlord, who in turn  paid  the  school
   fees.  The landlord pretended to be the appellant's father in  order  for
   him to have education.

5. The appellant's evidence was that his grandmother still lived in  Eritrea
   and that his mother was in contact with her.  The appellant claimed to be
   at risk of conscription in Eritrea if returned there now.

6. Neither the appellant  nor  his  mother  at  any  time  applied  for,  or
   asserted,  Ethiopian  citizenship.  The  appellant's  evidence  was  that
   Tigrinya, the principal language of Eritrea, was the language  spoken  in
   his home, and he gave evidence in that language.  The appellant  said  he
   spoke some Amharic, but was more comfortable in Tigrinya.

7. In November 2014, when the appellant was 14 years  old,  the  appellant's
   mother told him to leave Ethiopia with his uncle and he  travelled  first
   to Sudan for 2 months, then for over a year in  Libya,  where  his  uncle
   died in a car accident.  The appellant, still a minor,  travelled  on  to
   Italy, where he was fingerprinted on 28 May 2016, and on  through  France
   to the United Kingdom.  He had no contact with his mother  after  leaving
   Ethiopia, on his account.

8. The appellant stated that he entered the United Kingdom clandestinely  on
   27 January 2017.  He was 16 years old and claimed  asylum  based  on  the
   risk to him of forced military service in Eritrea.  On 21 July  2017  the
   respondent refused international protection, granting discretionary leave
   until the appellant would reach the age of 17ï¿½.

9. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.

First-tier Tribunal decision

10.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  considered  the  appeal  and  delivered  its
   decision on 4 September 2017.  The appellant was still 16 years old.  The
   Judge took into account the appellant's young age and the lower  standard
   of proof applicable in international protection  appeals.    He  accepted
   that the appellant's first language was Tigrinya, the principal  language
   in Eritrea.  He had not had any contact with  his  mother  since  leaving
   Ethiopia, which the Judge considered damaged his credibility, as did  the
   appellant's failure to access protection in Italy or France en  route  to
   the United Kingdom.

11. The Judge did not treat the appellant's  language  as  determinative  of
   his nationality.  He noted that the appellant's  evidence  about  Eritrea
   was vague, but had regard to the fact that he left Eritrea  aged  6.   He
   noted evidence that the appellant was the only  one  of  3  brothers  and
   sisters who  received  education  in  Ethiopia,  and  that  his  landlord
   pretended to be the appellant's father in order to obtain paid  education
   for him.

12. The Judge found that the nationality  information  in  the  respondent's
   refusal letter indicated that he and his mother  could  and  should  have
   accessed Ethiopian nationality while they were living there.   The  Judge
   made a comprehensive  negative  credibility  finding  and  dismissed  the
   appeal.

13. The appellant appealed to the Upper Tribunal.

Permission to appeal

14. The grounds of appeal contained a challenge to  the  Judge's  reasoning,
   arguing  that  immaterial  matters  had  been  taken  into  account  when
   assessing the appellant's evidence and in particular, that there  was  no
   finding whether he had left Eritrea legally or not.

15. Permission to appeal was granted on the basis that, in  particular,  the
   Judge's  reasoning  on  the  acquisition  of  Ethiopian  nationality  was
   arguably erroneous and that the failure to contact his  mother  had  been
   given disproportionate weight and insufficient weight given to his age at
   the various material times, including at the date of hearing.

Rule 24 Reply

16. The respondent in  his  Rule  24  Reply  asserted  that  the  First-tier
   Tribunal had directed itself appropriately, that  the  findings  of  fact
   were adequate, and adequately reasoned, and that the First-tier  Tribunal
   had been entitled to find that the appellant was not an Eritrean citizen,
   for the reasons given at page 4 of the Judge's decision.

17. That is the basis on which this appeal came before the Upper Tribunal.



Upper Tribunal hearing

18. At the hearing, Mr Diwnycz for  the  respondent  reminded  me  that  the
   respondent had sought to withdraw and remake his decision, but  that  the
   First-tier Tribunal  had  refused  permission  for  withdrawal,  and  the
   respondent had not challenged that ruling.  The respondent  was  not  now
   seeking to withdraw the decision.

Discussion

19. The Tribunal Procedure (First-tier  Tribunal)  (Immigration  and  Asylum
   Chamber) Rules 2014 at paragraph 17(2) requires the  First-tier  Tribunal
   to treat an appeal as withdrawn where the  respondent  has  either  given
   written or oral notice of withdrawal, specifying  reasons,  unless  there
   are good reasons for refusing to accept a  withdrawal.   Page  2  of  the
   decision (there are no paragraph numbers) applies  that  test  correctly.
   The respondent was not seeking to  alter  or  review  her  decision,  but
   rather to give different reasons with the outcome  (apparently  prejudged
   at the date of hearing) being the same.   The respondent, properly in  my
   view, has not challenged or renewed that application to withdraw and  has
   made no further decision in relation to this appellant.

20.  The  Tribunals  Judiciary  (Immigration  and  Asylum  Chambers)   Joint
   Presidential Guidance Note No 2 of  2010:  Child,  vulnerable  adult  and
   sensitive appellant guidance was not expressly applied in this  decision.
   However, I can discern no matter within that guidance  which  would  have
   affected the outcome of the appeal.

21. There is, however, unarguably an error in  the  Tribunal's  approach  to
   the question of Ethiopian nationality.  Reference is made to the  excerpt
   of the Ethiopian Nationality Proclamation No.378/2003, arts 4, 5 and 9 of
   which (if complete) appear at paragraph 13 of the  refusal  letter.   The
   Judge did not address his mind to the analysis of the Upper  Tribunal  in
   KK and others (Nationality: North Korea) Korea CG [2011] UKUT 92 (IAC) as
   to nationality which a person 'has' and nationality  which  they  may  be
   able to acquire.

22.  In  addition,  in  concluding  that  the  appellant's  credibility  was
   diminished by his failure  to  claim  Ethiopian  nationality,  the  Judge
   failed to engage with the terms of the Proclamation as therein  set  out,
   in particular with the requirement that naturalisation  applications  can
   be made only by adults (which while in  Ethiopia,  this  appellant  never
   was) or as the child of a naturalised parent, with the  consent  of  both
   parents, where the child can show that he  has  been  released  from  his
   previous nationality or has the possibility of  obtaining  such  release.
   The evidence in this case as set out in the decision may, or may not meet
   those requirements, but clear reasoning was required for a finding either
   way.

23. The respondent has not disputed that the appellant left Eritrea when  he
   was 6 years old to live in Ethiopia. The Upper Tribunal in MST and Others
   (national service - risk categories) Eritrea CG  [2016]  UKUT  443  (IAC)
   held that
         "... 10. Accordingly, a person whose  asylum  claim  has  not  been
         found credible, but who is able to  satisfy  a  decision-maker  (i)
         that he or she left illegally, and (ii) that he or  she  is  of  or
         approaching draft age, is likely to be perceived  on  return  as  a
         draft evader or deserter from national service and as a result face
         a real risk of persecution or serious harm."

24. The failure of the  First-tier  Tribunal  to  make  any  finding  as  to
   whether the appellant left Eritrea unlawfully and/or whether on return he
   was liable to military service is a material error of law and there is no
   alternative but to set the decision aside and direct that it be remade.

DECISION

25. For the foregoing reasons, my decision is as follows:
   The making of the previous decision involved the making of no error on  a
   point of law
   I set aside the previous decision.  The decision in this appeal  will  be
   remade in the First-tier Tribunal on a date to be fixed.
