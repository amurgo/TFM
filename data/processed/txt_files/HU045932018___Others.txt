Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr S Walker (Senior Presenting Officer)
For the Respondent:    Mr R Solomon (counsel for Jein Solicitors)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the decision  of
       the First-tier Tribunal of 31 October 2018 allowing  the  appeals  of
       Samantha [S], Ransini [N] and [KS], citizens of Sri Lanka born on  29
       March 1980, 28 July 1986 and 22 July  2014  respectively,  themselves
       brought against the Respondent's refusal of their human rights claims
       of 5 April 2018.

    2. Mr [S] entered the UK as a Tier 4 student in June  2010,  with  leave
       until August 2014 ultimately. His wife joined him in July 2011;  [KS]
       was born here. The parents' leave was curtailed on 25 May  2012  when
       Mr [S]'s Sponsor college's licence  was  revoked.  They  applied  for
       leave on human  rights  grounds,  and  though  that  application  was
       refused in July 2013, their appeal  was  successful,  and  they  were
       granted leave to remain until 7 April 2017. On 5 April 2017 they made
       an application on Article 8 grounds, whose  refusal  leads  to  these
       proceedings.

    3. The First-tier Tribunal  recorded  the  basis  of  the  human  rights
       claims. [KS] was a surviving twin, her  sibling  having  been  still-
       born. [KS] had serious health  problems,  congenital  heart  disease,
       moderate and severe pulmonary stenosis accompanied  by  a  dysplastic
       pulmonary valve, and resolved and patent ductus arteriosus;  she  had
       also been diagnosed with autistic spectrum disorder. She was under bi-
       annual and tri-annual reviews for her medical  conditions,  the  next
       being due in mid-20198, and received special one-to-one assistance in
       pre-school given her specific needs as an autistic child.

    4. The First-tier Tribunal accepted  the  family's  contention  that  no
       equivalent care regime would be available to [KS] in  Sri  Lanka.  It
       noted that it was well known that autistic children do not cope  well
       with change and would prefer to maintain their established  routines.
       Inevitably that regime would be seriously  disrupted  in  this  case,
       given that it was highly unlikely that  any  equivalent  arrangements
       would be available in Sri Lanka that were suitable  or  conducive  to
       her needs; indeed, the country evidence indicated that she would face
       some degree of social  ostracism  there  for  cultural  reasons.  Her
       physical health needs were presently managed under the supervision of
       medical, healthcare and educational specialists, and  its  disruption
       would foreseeably lead to a downward spiral in her overall health and
       well-being, which would inevitably be contrary to her best interests.



    5. Thus the First-tier Tribunal accepted that [KS]'s best interests were
       for her parents to remain in the UK and to  continue  assisting  with
       her present care regime.

    6. The Tribunal noted that the family had previously been granted  leave
       on private and family life grounds, with a view to permitting Mr  [S]
       to complete his UK studies. There had then been a radical  change  of
       circumstances, after which his ambition to do so was postponed due to
       the life-challenges the family faced, albeit he  credibly  maintained
       an intention to resume studying here if possible. It was the family's
       firm intention to return to Sri Lanka once that  was  done,  as  they
       anticipated  that  things  would  improve  in  the  next  few  years,
       presuming that [KS]'s health regime secured some overall  improvement
       in her circumstances, such that  it  might  be  realistic  to  source
       suitable care for her autism.

    7. As to the statutory considerations under section 117B NIAA 2002,  the
       parents could speak English and had had no recourse to  public  funds
       during their time here; they were self-financing. [KS] had of  course
       used the NHS, but that was in the context of the family  consistently
       holding valid leave, under section 3C of the Immigration Act 1971  or
       otherwise. Their leave had been consistently precarious, but that was
       only one factor to be balanced overall.

    8. The First-tier Tribunal concluded that the family's  departure  would
       occasion a  disproportionate  interference  with  their  private  and
       family life, and allowed the appeals.

    9. The Secretary of State appealed, arguing that the First-tier Tribunal
       had erred in law. By allowing the appeal under Article 8 ECHR, in the
       light of case law suggesting  there  was  a  similar  threshold  that
       linked Articles  3  and  8  ECHR  in  health  cases,  the  Judge  had
       effectively found that the family's  circumstances  would  amount  to
       inhuman and degrading treatment, which, given the high threshold  for
       such cases to  succeed,  was  an  inadequately  reasoned  conclusion.
       Furthermore the evidence of the family that they would contemplate  a
       return to Sri Lanka in the future was inconsistent with their  stance
       as to the non-availability of adequate medical treatment there.

   10. The First-tier Tribunal granted permission to appeal on  13  November
       2018 stating that it was arguable that  the  Judge's  conclusion  was
       inadequately reasoned.

   11. Mr Walker relied  on  the  grounds  of  appeal,  which  he  concisely
       developed without materially adding  to  their  written  content.  Mr
       Solomon responded that an Article 8 claim involving a child  did  not
       have to surpass the high threshold of N v UK.  In  JA  (Ivory  Coast)
       [2009] EWCA Civ 1353 the Court accepted that lawful  residence  where
       leave to remain was granted in the context of  full  knowledge  of  a
       person's health situation might differentiate the case from the norm.
       Numerous factors shown to be relevant by EV  (Philippines)  had  been
       properly identified and balanced in the Tribunal's  conclusions.  The
       duty to give reasons had been adequately discharged, to the  standard
       identified in decisions such as VV.

Findings and reasons

   12. "Reasons" challenges  are  brought  sufficiently  often  as  to  have
       generated a significant volume of authority as  to  their  ambit.  As
       noted by Beatson LJ in Haleemudeen [2014] EWCA Civ 558 �35, 37:

           "What is required is  that  the  reasons  must  give  sufficient
           detail to  show  the  parties  and  the  appellate  tribunal  or
           reviewing court the principles upon which the lower tribunal has
           acted, and the reasons that led it to its decision, so that they
           are able to understand why it reached its decision. The  reasons
           need not be elaborate, and need not  deal  with  every  argument
           presented ... judicial restraint should be  exercised  when  the
           reasons that  a  tribunal  gives  for  its  decision  are  being
           examined and it should not  be  assumed  too  readily  that  the
           tribunal misdirected  itself  because  not  every  step  in  its
           reasoning is set out in it".

   13. Similar thinking is shown in the UT decision cited by Mr Solomon,  VV
       (grounds of appeal) [2016] UKUT 53 (IAC):

           "24   ... even if the matter relates to a substantial  issue  or
           principal controversial issue, it is essential for an  appellant
           to show either that the judge has simply failed to resolve  that
           dispute, in other words there is a gap in the reasoning on  that
           point, or alternatively, that even though  the  issue  has  been
           dealt with, the reasoning is so unclear  that  the  Tribunal  is
           satisfied that it may  well  conceal  a  public  law  ground  of
           challenge (see e.g. Save Britain's Heritage at [1991] 1  WLR  at
           page 168). Likewise in  the  South  Bucks  DC  case  Lord  Brown
           reiterated (at [2004] 1 WLR at page 1964) that an Appellant must
           show "a substantial doubt as to whether the decision-maker erred
           in law ...". But he then added "such adverse inferences will not
           readily be drawn".

           25.   In  South  Bucks  DC  the  House  of  Lords  approved  (at
           paragraph 33) the well-known statement by Sir Thomas Bingham  MR
           that an issue as to whether the  reasons  for  a  decision  were
           inadequate "is to be resolved ... on a  straightforward  reading
           [of the  decision]  without  excessive  legalism  or  exegetical
           sophistication."  The  degree  of  particularity  required   for
           reasoning will depend entirely on the nature of the issues which
           have been raised by the  parties  for  the  judge  to  determine
           (paragraphs 28 and 36).

           26.   We also note that at paragraph 35 Lord Brown said that the
           restatement of the relevant legal principles in South  Bucks  DC
           should "serve to  focus  the  reader's  attention  on  the  main
           considerations to have in mind when contemplating  a  reasons  a
           challenge" and tend to discourage such challenges."

   14. It would be very difficult to hold that there is  any  inadequacy  in
       the Upper Tribunal's reasoning based on the  detail  with  which  its
       conclusions are expressed. Several factors are identified,  including
       the  statutory  considerations  set  out  in  section  117B  of   the
       Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, and their  relevance  to
       the Tribunal's conclusions are given careful attention.  It  is  very
       hard to see how the Secretary of State could seriously maintain  that
       those reasons are  incomprehensible.  Their  gravamen  is  that  this
       appeal involves a vulnerable child with  an  unusual  combination  of
       health and developmental  problems  arising  from  a  combination  of
       serious physical ailments plus a relatively high  degree  of  autism,
       and that the impact on the child of relocation to a country where she
       has not previously lived and where  she  has  no  experience  of  the
       culture of schooling would be unduly traumatic.

   15. So in reality it can be see that the Appellant's  grounds  of  appeal
       amount  to  a  disguised  challenge  that  the  First-tier   Tribunal
       misdirected itself as to the appropriate legal test; it  is  not  the
       quality of the reasoning, but the understanding of the law,  that  is
       in truth challenged as deficient.

   16. Health cases are to be assessed, when brought under Article  3  ECHR,
       by reference to the critical authorities, D v United  Kingdom  (1997)
       25 EHRR 31 and N  v  United  Kingdom  (2008)  47  EHRR  39,  and  the
       preceding House of Lords decision in the latter case, N  [2005]  UKHL
       31. The governing authority on the application of those tests  is  GS
       (India) [2015] EWCA Civ 40, where  Laws  LJ  stated  that  the  ratio
       decidendi of N in the House of Lords was plain enough:

           "36.  What was it then that made the case exceptional? It is to
           be found, I think, in the references to D's 'present medical
           condition' (para 50) and to that fact that he was terminally ill
           (paras 51: 'the advanced stages of a terminal and incurable
           illness'; para 52: 'a terminally ill man'; para 53: 'the
           critical stage now reached in the applicant's fatal illness';
           Judge Pettiti: 'the final stages of an incurable illness'). It
           was the fact that he was already terminally ill while still
           present in the territory of the expelling state that made his
           case exceptional." (per Lord Hope)

           ...

           "69.  In my view, therefore, the test, in this sort of case, is
           whether the applicant's illness has reached such a critical
           stage (ie he is dying) that it would be inhuman treatment to
           deprive him of the care which he is currently receiving and send
           him home to an early death unless there is care available there
           to enable him to meet that fate with dignity." (per Lady Hale)

   17. The threshold as applied in the UK may in due course be revisited  at
       Supreme Court level, having regard to the decision in  Paposhvili  v.
       Belgium (Application no. 41738/10; 13 December 2016), but for now the
       ruling of the House of Lords applies.

   18. The Upper Tribunal in GS and  EO  summarised  other  aspects  of  the
       established case law regarding to health and human rights:

        a) The cases of children were one  of  the  "recognised  departures
           from the high threshold approach" [85](7)(c);

        b) It "is the practical availability of the treatment  rather  than
           its theoretical availability which is important", a question  to
           be established on the evidence: [85](4)(e).

   19. The foregoing aims  to  summarise  the  salient  case  law  regarding
       Article 3 ECHR in health cases. Moving on to the relationship between
       human rights and health in the private life context,  the  Strasbourg
       Court in Bensaid v United Kingdom 44599/98 [2001] ECHR 82  �46:  "Not
       every act or  measure  which  adversely  affects  moral  or  physical
       integrity will interfere with the right to respect  to  private  life
       guaranteed by Article 8.  However,  the  Court's  case-law  does  not
       exclude that treatment which does not reach the severity of Article 3
       treatment may nonetheless breach Article 8 in its private-life aspect
       where there are sufficiently adverse effects on  physical  and  moral
       integrity (see Costello-Roberts v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 25
       March 1993, Series A no. 247-C, pp. 60-61, � 36)."

   20. Moses LJ in MM (Zimbabwe) [2012] EWCA Civ 279 �23: "The only cases  I
       can foresee where the absence of adequate medical  treatment  in  the
       country to which a person is to  be  deported  will  be  relevant  to
       Article 8, is where it is an additional factor to be weighed  in  the
       balance, with other factors which by themselves engage Article 8".

   21. The operation of these various considerations in the case of children
       whose private life includes  a  health  dimension  is  summed  up  by
       Maurice Kay LJ in SQ (Pakistan) [2013] EWCA Civ 1251:

           "21.  ZH (Tanzania) demonstrates the central role  of  the  best
           interests of a child in an Article 8 case. The archaeology is as
           follows. International treaty obligations, in particular Article
           3(1) of the CRC have developed a consistent theme. Article  3(1)
           provides:

                "In all actions concerning children, whether  undertaken  by
                public or private social  welfare  institutions,  courts  of
                law, administrative authorities or legislative  bodies,  the
                best  interests  of   the   child   shall   be   a   primary
                consideration."

           22.   Section 11 of the Children Act 2004 obliges a  wide  range
           of public bodies to carry out their functions having  regard  to
           the need to safeguard  and  promote  the  welfare  of  children.
           Initially, the immigration authorities were  excused  from  this
           obligation  because  this  country   had   entered   a   general
           reservation  to  the  Convention  in  relation  to   immigration
           matters. However, things changed with the enactment  of  section
           55 in 2009. It requires that, in relation to immigration, asylum
           and nationality, the Secretary of State must  make  arrangements
           for ensuring that those functions

                "are discharged having regard to the need to  safeguard  and
                promote the welfare  of  children  who  are  in  the  United
                Kingdom."

           The wide significance of this was explained by Baroness Hale  in
           paragraph 24 of her judgment in ZH:

                "This means that any decision which is taken without  regard
                to the need to safeguard and  promote  the  welfare  of  any
                children involved will not be 'in accordance with  the  law'
                for the purpose of Article 8(2). Both the Secretary of State
                and the tribunal will therefore  have  to  address  this  in
                their decisions."

           To require that the best interests of the child are  "a  primary
           consideration" does not mean that those  interests  must  always
           prevail. As Baroness Hale went on to say (at paragraph 33):

                "In making the proportionality assessment under  Article  8,
                the  best  interests  of  the  child  must  be   a   primary
                consideration. This  means  that  they  must  be  considered
                first. They can, of course, be outweighed by the  cumulative
                effect  of  other  considerations.   In   this   case,   the
                countervailing considerations were the need to maintain firm
                and fair immigration  control,  coupled  with  the  mother's
                appalling immigration history and the precariousness of  her
                position when family life was created. But, as the  Tribunal
                rightly pointed out, the children were not to be blamed  for
                that."

           ...

           26.   What  this  case  demonstrates  is  that  in  some  cases,
           particularly but not only in relation to children, Article 8 may
           raise issues separate from Article 3.  In  JA  (Ivory  Coast)  v
           Secretary of State for the Home Department [2009] EWCA Civ 1353,
           an adult succeeded under Article 8 (but  not  Article  3)  in  a
           health case. Sedley LJ emphasised (at paragraph 17) that each of
           the two Articles "has to be approached and applied  in  its  own
           terms". The leading authorities of D and N were distinguished on
           the basis that, in both of them, the  appellants'  presence  and
           treatment in  this  country  "were  owed  entirely  to  unlawful
           entry". JA's appeal was allowed and her case remitted because of
           the potential significance  of  the  fact  that,  following  her
           lawful entry and subsequent diagnosis  of  HIV+,  she  had  been
           granted further  exceptional  leave  to  remain  for  treatment.
           Although no separate Article 8 issue arose in D or N, it plainly
           did in JA."

   22. It is clear from the passages above that the cases  of  children  may
       raise different considerations from those of adults, whether assessed
       in the context of inhuman and degrading treatment or by reference  to
       private life; it is also apparent and that Article 8 ECHR involves  a
       different focus of enquiry than does the assessment of Article 3.

   23. Having completed this rather lengthy preamble, it becomes possible to
       analyse the  Secretary  of  State's  grounds  of  appeal.  The  first
       authority cited is Sales LJ in MM (Zimbabwe)  [2017]  EWCA  Civ  797,
       who, having cited the decision of Moses LJ in  (the  similarly  named
       case) MM (itself cited above), stated:

           "42.  In our case, the FTT found that MM could not succeed under
           Article 3, because MM could not satisfy the stringent test
           applicable under that Article. In those circumstances, I
           consider that the FTT erred in holding that MM could nonetheless
           succeed in his claim under Article 8, even though it was based
           on the same basic point that MM would suffer a deterioration in
           his mental health by reason of the non-availability to him in
           Zimbabwe of the drugs which have been effective in the United
           Kingdom in restoring him to sanity. The FTT did not identify any
           strong Article 8 claim by MM independent of his claim to benefit
           from medical treatment, of a kind contemplated in MM (Zimbabwe)
           in the passage quoted above. The FTT also failed to apply the
           same stringent test under Article 8 as it had applied under
           Article 3."

   24. The SSHD also draws attention to the reference in  AM  (Zimbabwe)  to
       the decision in GS (India) [2015] EWCA Civ 40, which at �6  Sales  LJ
       equated to having "brought the test under Article 3 and the  approach
       under Article 8 into close alignment".  It  is  notable  that  in  GS
       (India) �45, 86, Laws LJ stated

           "the core value protected by Article 8 is the quality  of  life,
           not its continuance. Life itself is protected by Article 2.  And
           it requires no sophisticated philosophy to tell us that  central
           to the quality of  life  is  the  capacity  to  form  and  enjoy
           relationships. Other elements referred to in these  authorities,
           such as gender identification, name, sexual orientation,  sexual
           life and mental health are self-evidently integral to that  same
           capacity.

           ...

           If the Article 3 claim fails (as I would  hold  it  does  here),
           Article 8 cannot prosper without  some  separate  or  additional
           factual element which brings  the  case  within  the  Article  8
           paradigm - the capacity to form and enjoy relationships -  or  a
           state of affairs having some affinity with the paradigm."

   25. Underhill LJ alongside him (in AM) stated �111 of Moses LJ in MM:

           "There are possibly some ambiguities in the details of the
           reasoning in that passage, but I think it is clear that two
           essential points are being made. First, the absence or
           inadequacy of medical treatment, even life-preserving treatment,
           in the country of return, cannot be relied on at all as a factor
           engaging article 8: if that is all there is, the claim must
           fail. Secondly, where article 8 is engaged by other factors, the
           fact that the claimant is receiving medical treatment in this
           country which may not be available in the country of return may
           be a factor in the proportionality exercise; but that factor
           cannot be treated as by itself giving rise to a breach since
           that would contravene the "no obligation to treat" principle."

   26. SL (St Lucia) which the Secretary of State's grounds of  appeal  also
       cites is on all fours with these passages.

   27. The Secretary of State's essential argument is that there is a  close
       equiparation in the case  law  governing  health  claims  brought  by
       reference to Articles 3 and 8. There is some truth in this assertion,
       in so far as the claim involves health considerations alone;  private
       life claims do not provide for any lowering of the  threshold,  where
       they turn solely on a treatment "gap" between the UK and abroad.

   28. However, there is a real difference between private life  claims  and
       Article 3 cases when it comes to cases that turn on a  broader  array
       of considerations. The First-tier Tribunal was plainly alive to  this
       distinction. Its decision  was  not  driven  by  a  simple  treatment
       differential between  the  UK  and  Sri  Lanka;  it  was  a  detailed
       combination  of  factors,  ranging  from  the  likelihood  of  social
       ostracism and the relatively extreme impact of significant change  on
       an autistic child who has become accustomed to a particular care  and
       educational regime, that concerned the First-tier Tribunal.

   29. So it can be seen that this was  not  a  case  which  turned  on  the
       absence of adequate  medical  treatment  abroad.  Indeed,  given  the
       reliance on the  difficulties  facing  an  autistic  child  following
       relocation, and the possibility of ostracism, it is clear  that  "the
       capacity to form and enjoy relationships" was central to the relevant
       reasoning. There was no error of law here.

   30. The Secretary of State also complains of the approach  of  the  Judge
       below to the possibility that the  family  would  relocate  to  their
       country of origin in the future. As I remarked at the  hearing,  this
       is a surprising challenge, as it is customarily thought that the fact
       that leave is sought for a limited  rather  than  indefinite  purpose
       would count in favour of the migrant's side  of  the  balance  rather
       than weighting the scales against them.

   31. In any event, I do not accept that  there  was  any  tension  in  the
       Tribunal's findings here. It recognised that  the  present  practical
       necessity for this family, to secure the daughter's welfare,  was  to
       remain in the UK, albeit that they held a longer term  aspiration  to
       return to Sri Lanka if that became possible in the fullness of  time.
       It seems to me that he First-tier Tribunal did not make  inconsistent
       findings: it merely recognised that a future wish to return might co-
       exist with a present recognition of that possibility being  presently
       out of the question.

   32. There being no error of law in  the  decision  below,  I  accordingly
       dismiss the appeal.

Decision

The appeal is dismissed.
