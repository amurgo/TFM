Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr M Shilliday, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr A Mackenzie, Counsel


                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1.   The respondent to this appeal, Mr Mbeboh, is a citizen  of  Cameroon
      born on 25 May 1983. The appellant is the Secretary of State  for  the
      Home Department, who has appealed with the permission  of  the  First-
      tier Tribunal against a decision of Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal
      Scobbie, who allowed Mr Mbeboh's appeal against the decision to remove
      Mr Mbeboh to Cameroon as an overstayer, having refused  him  leave  on
      article 8 grounds.


   2.   It is more convenient to refer to the parties as  they  were  before
      the First-tier Tribunal. I shall therefore refer to Mr Mbeboh from now
      on as "the appellant" and the Secretary of State as "the respondent".


   3.   I was not asked and saw no reason to make an anonymity direction.


   4.   The judge found that the appellant met the requirements of the rules
      on article 8 private life grounds because he was satisfied there would
      be very significant obstacles to the appellant's integration into  the
      country he would have to go to (see paragraph  276ADE(vi)  of  HC395).
      The respondent sought permission to appeal on the basis the judge  had
      erred by applying too low a test. Permission was granted by the First-
      tier Tribunal.


   5.   The appellant filed a response opposing the appeal and  arguing  the
      determination does not contain any error.

   6.   I heard submissions as to whether the  judge  had  made  a  material
      error of law in his decision.  Mr  Shilliday  relied  on  the  grounds
      seeking permission to appeal. I have recorded all of his  submissions.
      At the heart of his case was that the judge had shown in paragraph  26
      that he had applied too low a test  to  meet  the  high  threshold  of
      paragraph 276ADE(vi), which requires there  to  be  "very  significant
      obstacles to the applicant's integration into  the  country  he  would
      have to go to." In paragraph 26, the judge said:  "The  expert  report
      which has not  been  particularly  challenged  on  this  matter  quite
      clearly indicates that this particular  Appellant  would  struggle  to
      integrate into Cameroon." Mr Shilliday  submitted  this  was  the  key
      paragraph in respect of the judge's findings and it  showed  that  the
      judge had the wrong test  in  mind.  His  decision  was  fundamentally
      flawed. He also pointed out that there was an error  in  the  expert's
      assessment because she noted the appellant  could  not  speak  French,
      whereas the appellant could.


   7.   In reply Mr Mackenzie argued the words highlighted by  Mr  Shilliday
      had to be looked at in context and the judge had had the correct  test
      in mind. The respondent's  grounds  amounted  to  no  more  than  mere
      disagreement with the judge's decision. The expert had given  a  range
      of reasons why the appellant would not be able to reintegrate and  the
      judge had been entitled to rely on these reasons  to  which  he  added
      some of his own. Mr Shilliday replied briefly, clarifying some of  his
      earlier arguments.


   8.   I find no material error  of  law  in  the  judge's  decision.  Both
      parties agreed his findings were terse. However, that is  not  to  say
      they were inadequate. He plainly placed a great deal of weight on  the
      unchallenged opinion of the expert, which he was entitled  to  do.  At
      page 14 of her report, the expert listed various factors  which  would
      in her opinion show why the appellant would  face  numerous  obstacles
      which would significantly hinder his reintegration. These included the
      fact he would lack the patronage and peer networks necessary to access
      suitable jobs. His lack of French would make it impossible to navigate
      the social and professional milieu of  his  peer  group.  The  current
      regime disfavours the Anglophone minority  politically,  socially  and
      economically. He was raised among the expatriate community in Yaoundï¿½.
      His maternal family had  dispersed  and  he  was  estranged  from  his
      paternal family. It was most likely impossible for  the  appellant  to
      support himself in Cameroon.


   9.   There was much discussion  of  whether  the  appellant  could  speak
      French and therefore whether the expert's report was based on a  false
      premise. I do not think any error should undermine the overall  effect
      of the expert's evidence. I also think it is likely that the reference
      to the appellant "not having French"  has  to  be  understood  in  the
      context of the earlier reference to his having "limited French", which
      is the more accurate description. The  reference  to  his  not  having
      French should be read as meaning having French as primary language.


  10. The use of the word "struggle" in paragraph 26  of  the  determination
      would, taken  in  isolation,  indicate  an  incorrect  test  had  been
      applied. However, the judge set out the correct test in the  preceding
      paragraph and repeated it in paragraph 27, in which he summarised  his
      conclusions. It is an arid exercise to pick out one instance of  loose
      wording and to suggest the judge had applied the wrong legal test. The
      argument is simply unsustainable in this case for the reasons given.


  11. It is also important to note the judge did not  simply  refer  to  the
      report but he went on in paragraph 26 to summarise the  factors  which
      led him to conclude the rule was met. In short, the  judge  took  into
      account relevant evidence and reached a conclusion which it  was  open
      to him to reach, applying the correct legal test.


  12. There was also discussion of the relevance of  the  existence  of  the
      appellant's ties with Cameroon, perhaps as a result of paragraph 8  of
      the grounds, and the consequence of the change  in  the  rule  brought
      about by the amendment on 28 July 2014. I was  not  much  assisted  by
      this debate. The new rule was  applied  by  the  judge,  applying  the
      relevant evidence.


  13. The judge's decision does not disclose any material error of  law  and
      shall stand.
