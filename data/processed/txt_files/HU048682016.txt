For the Respondent:    Mr A Govan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. First-tier Judge Agnew dismissed the appellant's appeal on human rights
    grounds by a decision promulgated on 7 August 2017.

 2. The appellant's grounds of  appeal  to  the  UT  are  set  out  in  her
    application to the FtT dated 10 August 2017.  The points  advanced  are
    at the following paragraphs of the grounds:

         �16 - 18 - failure to follow SF and  others  (Guidance,  post  2014
         Act) Albania  [2017]  UKUT  00120,  which  should  have  led  to  a
         different outcome.

         �19, failure to consider the rights of the appellant's  UK  citizen
         partner and children, contrary  to  PD  and  others  (Article  8  -
         conjoined family claims) [2016] UKUT 108.

         �20, failure to make a clear finding on �EX.1 [of  the  immigration
         rules]; jumping to the circumstances of  the  appellant's  partner;
         deviating from the main issue in the appeal.

         �21,  finding  no  evidence  it  would  be  unreasonable  for   the
         appellant's children and partner to go to Nigeria, and referring to
         the original Nigerian nationality of the  appellant's  partner  "an
         element of bias ... as in effect asserting  the  outcome  would  be
         different  if  the  appellant's  partner  had  no  connection  with
         Nigeria".

         �22, the findings under s.55 of the 2009 Act and s.117B(6)  of  the
         2002 Act "are flawed.  If no evidence was placed before  the  judge
         as stated [at �30 of her  decision]  how  the  judge  came  to  the
         conclusion that it would be reasonable  for  the  whole  family  to
         decamp to Nigeria" [sic].

 3. In the FtT, the  appellant  had  representatives  experienced  in  this
    jurisdiction, while the respondent was unrepresented.   The  judge  was
    not referred to SF and others or  to  PD  and  others.   The  appellant
    changed representatives after the hearing.  Her current representatives
    are the authors of the grounds of appeal to the UT.

 4. Mr Tampuri referred to �7 of SF and others  and  to  the  policy  there
    excerpted:

         "Mr Wilding,  however,  has  with  the  fairness  which  Presenting
         Officers always  attempt  to  apply,  drawn  our  attention  to  an
         important guidance document.  It  is  the  Immigration  Directorate
         Instruction -  Family  Migration  -  Appendix  FM,  Section  1.0(B)
         "Family Life as a Partner or  Parent  and  Private  Life,  10  year
         Routes".  It is the edition of August 2015  and  therefore  not  in
         force at the date of the decision under appeal, but it was in force
         at the date of the First-tier Tribunal hearing and decision, and is
         still in force.  It contains important guidance about the following
         topic at 11.2.3: Would it  be  unreasonable  to  expect  a  British
         Citizen Child to leave the UK?  We will set out the relevant parts,
         they are as follows:


             "Save in cases involving criminality, the decision maker  must
             not take a decision in relation to the parent or primary carer
             of a British Citizen child where the effect of  that  decision
             would be  to  force  that  British  child  to  leave  the  EU,
             regardless of  the  age  of  that  child.  This  reflects  the
             European Court of Justice Judgment in Zambrano.


             ...


             Where a decision to refuse the  application  would  require  a
             parent or primary carer to return to a country outside the EU,
             the case must always be assessed on the basis that it would be
             unreasonable to expect a British Citizen child to leave the EU
             with that parent or primary carer.


             In such cases it will usually be appropriate to grant leave to
             the parent or primary carer, to enable them to remain  in  the
             UK  with  the  child,  provided  that  there  is  satisfactory
             evidence of a genuine and subsisting parental relationship.


             It may, however, be appropriate to refuse to grant leave where
             the conduct of the parent  or  primary  carer  gives  rise  to
             considerations of such weight as to justify separation, if the
             child could otherwise stay with another parent or  alternative
             primary carer in the UK or in the EU.


             The circumstances envisaged could cover amongst others:


                . criminality  falling  below  the  thresholds  set  out  in
                  paragraph 398 of the Immigration Rules;


                . a very poor immigration history, such as where the  person
                  has repeatedly and deliberately breached  the  Immigration
                  Rules.


             In considering whether refusal may be appropriate the decision
             maker must consider the impact on the child of any separation.
             If the decision maker is minded to  refuse,  in  circumstances
             where separation would be the  result,  this  decision  should
             normally be discussed with  a  senior  caseworker  and,  where
             appropriate, advice may be  sought  from  the  Office  of  the
             Children's Champion on the implications for the welfare of the
             child, in order to inform the decision."


         We were not  specifically  referred  to  any  other  part  of  this
         document and we do not need to set any more out."


 5. SF goes on to hold that where guidance clearly  demonstrates  what  the
    outcome of an assessment by the  SSHD  would  have  been,  that  should
    normally be applied by a tribunal.

 6. Mr Tampuri submitted that applying the policy  to  the  facts  as  they
    stood before the FtT, the judge should have found that  �EX.1  (a)  and
    (b) of the rules was satisfied, and should have allowed the  appeal  on
    human rights grounds.

 7. Mr Govan submitted that the terms  of  the  policy  could  justify  the
    removal of the appellant and the possibility of her separation from the
    children in this case, but I was  unable  to  see  how  that  could  be
    accommodated.  I indicated that  the  decision  of  the  FtT  would  be
    reversed.

 8. The respondent's decision was reached  on  the  basis  that  the  three
    children of the appellant were not UK citizens.  On the facts  as  then
    perceived, the appellant had no likely case.

 9. Before the FtT, however, the facts were that the  father  and  the  two
    older children were all UK citizens.

10. The status of the third child  remained  unclear,  but  that  does  not
    affect the outcome.

11. The judge held that there was nothing before her to show that it  would
    be unreasonable for the children to live in Nigeria with their parents.

12. Simply on the evidence before the  FtT,  that  would  appear  to  be  a
    legitimate outcome; but unfortunately, the judge was  not  referred  to
    the respondent's policy, or to SF.

13. This was not a case where the UK citizen children would  be  forced  to
    leave the UK, because one option is for them to remain here with  their
    father.  However, it is a case which must be assessed on the basis that
    it would be unreasonable to expect the children  to  leave  with  their
    mother.  There are no "circumstances  of  such  weight  as  to  justify
    separation".  There is no  history  of  criminality.   The  immigration
    history is poor, in that the appellant  overstayed  on  a  visit  visa,
    which was a deliberate breach of the rules, but it could not reasonably
    be said to be "very poor".

14. Once the policy is identified and applied,  it  dictates  the  outcome,
    even in absence of any evidence that the departure of the  children  in
    family to Nigeria would in  fact  be  significantly  adverse  to  their
    interests.

15. I have referred also to the policy  as  updated  and  published  on  22
    February 2018.  It is to the same effect.

16. It is unnecessary to deal with the rest of the grounds, and there  were
    no submissions thereon.  However, I would record that I do not see  any
    merit in the suggestion of an element of bias.  The Nigerian origins of
    the father would obviously be relevant  in  assessing  whether  it  was
    reasonable to expect the family members to relocate  to  Nigeria.   (It
    seems likely that he retains Nigerian nationality, and that  is  shared
    by all five family members; but in terms of policy, that is trumped  by
    co-existing UK nationality.)

17. The decision of the FtT is set aside, and  the  following  decision  is
    substituted: the appeal, as originally brought to the FtT, is allowed.

18. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
