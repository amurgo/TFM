                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appellant

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Mauritius born on 27 January 1983 and  he
    made an application on 31 August 2014 to extend his leave as a  Tier  4
    (General) Student Migrant and for a biometric residence  permit.   That
    application was refused on 25 September 2014 under  paragraph  245ZX(d)
    because he had not been awarded 10 points  for  maintenance  funds.   A
    decision was also made to remove him by way of directions under Section
    47 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.

 2. The appeal came before First-tier Tribunal Judge Turquet  on  14  April
    2015 and on 6 May 2015 she dismissed the appellant's appeal both  under
    the Immigration Rules and on human rights grounds.

 3. It had been the contention of the appellant that he had always had  the
    required level of funds available in his account for 28 days to satisfy
    the maintenance requirements.

 4. The decision letter of the Secretary of State read

         ".   You are required to show living  costs  of  �1,640  plus  your
             outstanding course fees of �5,495 as stated on your  CAS.  You
             are therefore required to show that you are in  possession  of
             �7,135 for a consecutive 28 day period  to  meet  the  Tier  4
             (General) Student maintenance requirements.

         .    As the closing balance of  the  bank  statement  submitted  in
             support of your application is dated 18 August 2014  you  need
             to show evidence of maintenance for 28 days from 22 July  2014
             to 18 August 2014.  On 18 August 2014 the bank statements  you
             have submitted  show  a  balance  of  �4,000  which  does  not
             demonstrate that the required level of funds is  available  to
             you."

 5. Judge Turquet  recorded  that  the  appellant  claimed  that  with  the
    application form that he provided a Confirmation of  Acceptance  letter
    (CAS) which confirmed payment of �3,300. He was thus only  required  to
    show the availability of �1,640 plus �2,195  totalling  �3,835  in  his
    account for 28 days prior to the application.   He  had  submitted  his
    Santander Bank account  showing  the  availability  of  �4,000  in  his
    account for 28 days and he had �4,000 and thus he was only required  to
    show �3,835 to  satisfy  the  requirements.   He  maintained  that  the
    respondent had not looked at the documentary  evidence  properly.   The
    appellant maintained that he was the victim of unfairness and he should
    be awarded 10 points for maintenance.

    Application for Permission to Appeal

 6. An application for permission to  appeal  against  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Turquet's decision was made. With his application  the  appellant
    claimed he submitted the Central Sussex College  CAS  letter  dated  28
    August 2014 confirming that on 26 August 2014 he  paid  �3,300  to  the
    college as a tuition fee and thus a balance  of  only  �2,195  remained
    unpaid.  He had also submitted a receipt  from  the  college  dated  26
    August 2014.  He also submitted another letter dated 26 March 2015 from
    the college authority confirming on 26 August 2014 he  paid  �3,300  to
    the college as the tuition fees.  The judge alleged that the  appellant
    did not submit any evidence  to  show  he  had  the  figure  of  �7,135
    throughout the 28 day period and erred.

 7. On the date of the appeal hearing the Home Office submitted  an  online
    CAS letter which the appellant did not receive from the  college.   The
    appellant was  shocked and surprised and  this  was  an  administrative
    error on the part of the college authority.  It also issued the  online
    CAS letter with the wrong information.  The judge  wrote  at  paragraph
    14: "There is no supporting evidence from the  college  explaining  why
    the CAS did not indicate fees paid at the date the  CAS  was  assigned"
    and the judge erred in law as the appellant had no knowledge  that  the
    college did not  provide  correct  information  regarding  the  payment
    tuition fees. Had the appellant had any  knowledge  that  the  CAS  had
    issued a CAS letter with incorrect information regarding the payment of
    fees he would have gone to the  college  and  collected  an  additional
    letter.

 8. After receiving the Tribunal's determination the  appellant  contracted
    the college for an explanation.  By a letter  dated  13  May  2015  the
    college confirmed that on 26 August 2014 the appellant had paid  �3,300
    as tuition fee to the college and a letter was  attached  for  ease  of
    reference.   The  appellant  submitted  three  independent  pieces   of
    documentary evidence confirming the payment of �3,300 on 26 August 2014
    to which the judge did not refer and thus erred in law.

 9. In addition to the above documents the appellant also  bank  statements
    from another amount number in which he had �4,000 for 28 days prior  to
    the date of his application which was not considered by the judge.

10. In the light of Naved (Student - fairness - notice  of  points)  [2012]
    UKUT 14 (IAC) it was respectfully requested to allow this appeal as the
    decision was not compatible with the common law duty to act fairly  and
    was not in accordance with the law.

    Grant of Permission to Appeal

11. First-tier Tribunal Judge Simpson stated that there was a letter  dated
    26 March 2015 which  confirmed  that  a  deposit  of  �3,300  had  been
    received by the college on 28 August 2014 and it was arguable that  the
    online CAS marked "Used" was not accurate as it was  arguable  that  it
    was unfair not to provide the appellant with the  opportunity  to  make
    enquiries with the college as to this apparent discrepancy  given  that
    the online CAS was not served on him prior to the hearing.

12. The Rule 24 response was served at the hearing.

    Conclusions

13. A letter was sent  by  EU  Migration  Services  dated  7  October  2015
    confirming that the appellant would be unable  to  attend  the  hearing
    scheduled for 12 October and the matter should proceed without  him  or
    representation.  I am satisfied that  the  appellant  has  submitted  a
    sufficient explanation of his appeal and that the matter could  proceed
    justly on the evidence before me.

14. I am not persuaded that there is an error of law in this decision.   At
    paragraphs 14 and 15 the judge set out the following:

         "14. The appellant's CAS assigned on 28.8.04 indicates that no fees
             were paid. According  to  the  appellant  he  paid  �3,300  on
             26.8.2014.  On his application form dated 31.8.2014 he  stated
             that he had paid �3,300. The  appellant  submitted  a  receipt
             indicating that he had paid �3,300 on 26.8.20145. However this
             is not shown on the CAS. There is no supporting evidence  from
             the college explaining why the findings did not indicate  fees
             paid at the date the CAS was assigned. The appellant  did  not
             submit a copy of his bank statement  showing  the  payment  of
             �3,300 and the balance in his account after payment.

         15.  In the event that he made a payment of 26.8.2014, he  has  not
             satisfied me on the balance of probabilities that he funds  of
             �7,135 in his bank account for the 28 day  consecutive  period
             as required. Paragraph 11 of  Appendix  C  provides  that  the
             appellant must provide the specified documents in paragraph 1B
             to show the funds available to him.  The relevant  requirement
             for the appellant is  that  he  provide  a  personal  bank  or
             building society  statement  covering  a  consecutive  28  day
             period of time and that the most recent statement must not  be
             dated more than 31 days before the date of the application. As
             the appellant only had �4,000 in his account on 18.8.2014,  he
             has not explained how   he  could   have  made  a  payment  of
             �3,300 on 26.8.2014   and  still  have  a  balance  of  �1,640
             (maintenance) plus �2,195 (balance of fees) totalling �3,  835
             at the date of application. The appellant has not satisfied me
             that he had the relevant funds of �7, 135 in his bank for  the
             consecutive 28 day period as required. He does  not  meet  the
             Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant maintenance requirements."

15. I can see from the CAS assigned on 28 August  2014  under  the  section
    "Accommodation and Fees" the course fees charged for the first year  of
    the course were �5,495 and annexed to "Course fees paid  to  date"  the
    total of �0 was inserted.

16. It is the appellant's  contention  that  he  paid  the  sum  of  �3,300
    immediately  prior  to  this  CAS  being  assigned  and  this  was  not
    registered and indeed  he  produced  a  letter  dated  28  August  2014
    confirming that the  appellant  had  paid  �3,300  and  that  this  was
    received by Central Sussex College on 26 August 2014.  That may be  the
    case but the difficulty with the appellant's case is that he  submitted
    bank statements showing funds which were dated up to  18  August  2014.
    Further to paragraph 1B  of  Appendix  C  the  appellant  must  show  a
    consecutive 28 day period of time  if  he  is  applying  as  a  Tier  4
    Migrant.  As the judge did acknowledge, the appellant  had  produced  a
    Santander Bank statement from 18 July to 18 August 2014 but at no  time
    did he go over the �4,000 limit.  Up until 18 August which is the  last
    date of the bank statements produced in accordance with the Immigration
    Rules to the respondent the appellant  only  had  up  to  �4,000.   The
    critical date is 18 August 2014 and at that date as the  judge  pointed
    out, he had not paid the fees and there was no evidence that he had any
    other funds.  The appellant had to by virtue  of  paragraph  1B  comply
    with the 28 day Rule  but  had  not  paid  off  his  fees  in  time  to
    demonstrate adequate funds under the  28  day  Rule  and  a  CAS  which
    reflected a contribution to the fees.

17. The appellant has failed to meet the requirements of paragraph  245Z(d)
    and the judge has more  than  adequately  explained  her  reasons.   On
    examination of the file the CAS clearly shows that  the  appellant  had
    not paid the �3,300 as at the date of the CAS.

18. It is clear that the respondent considered the CAS.  EK (Ivory Coast) v
    Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department  [2014]  EWCA  Civ  1517
    confirms that the onus is on the appellant to comply  with  the  rules.
    That is the case even where colleges make mistakes in  respect  of  the
    CAS because of the requirement for predictability within the Rules.   I
    am not persuaded in this instance that the college did make a  mistake.
    The fact is that although the appellant stated in his application  form
    that he intended to pay �3,300 the appellant had not  done  so  by  the
    date of the last bank statement.   No  bank  statements  were  produced
    showing that the appellant had the relevant funds, even if he had  paid
    the �3,300, for the relevant 28 day period.  I am  not  persuaded  that
    the appellant can demonstrate any unfairness.

19. There is no error of law and the decision of Judge Turquet shall stand.
