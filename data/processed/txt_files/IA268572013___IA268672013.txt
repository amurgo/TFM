Representation:

For the Appellant: Mr E Waheed of counsel instructed by Mitchell and Co
solicitors
For the Respondent: Mr C Avery a Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS

1. The appellants are citizens of Pakistan and husband and wife. The
   husband was born on 1 January 1970 and the wife on 9 September 1982. They
   have been given permission to appeal the determination of First-Tier
   Tribunal Judge Mrs RJNB Morris ("the FTTJ") who dismissed their appeals
   against the respondent's decisions of 23 May 2013 to refuse the husband
   leave to remain in the UK as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant under the
   Points-based System and to refuse the wife leave as his spouse.


2. The husband was first granted leave to enter the UK as a student on 14
   September 2008 for a period expiring on 31 January 2010. He was granted
   further periods of leave firstly as a student and secondly as a Tier 1
   (Post Study) Migrant. The last period of leave expired on 11 January
   2013. On 11 January 2013 the husband, the wife and their four children
   made further separate applications which have led to these appeals. The
   respondent issued six separate refusal decisions on 23 May 2013, one for
   each of the husband, the wife and the children. Each of these generated a
   separate right of appeal.


3. The appellants' solicitors made six separate appeal applications and, as
   enquiries carried out at my request by the Tribunal staff now show, six
   separate appeal files were generated each with its own appeal number.
   These enquiries also show that the appeals of the four children have been
   listed for hearing in the First-Tier Tribunal on 28 August 2014.


4. In refusing the husband's application the respondent declined to award
   him the required points for access to funds, funds held in a regulated
   financial institution, funds disposable in the UK and Maintenance
   (funds). He was awarded the required 10 points for English language
   skills. He was not awarded the points for the financial requirements
   because the respondent considered that, whilst he had provided evidence
   that there was at least ï¿½50,000 in an account with HSBC, he had not
   established that he had access to these funds. The other appellants'
   applications were refused in line with his.


5. The appeals of the husband and the wife came before the FTTJ on 24
   October 2013. Both parties were represented. The appellant's
   representative said that there had been six separate applications by the
   husband and wife and the children and six separate refusals. The
   respondent had not considered her obligations under Section 55 of the
   Borders Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 with the result that the
   decisions in relation to the children were not in accordance with the
   law. Furthermore, the respondent had not complied with her own evidential
   flexibility policy or the principles in Rodriguez (Flexibility Policy)
   [2013] UKUT 00042 (IAC). It was argued that the proper course of action
   would be to remit the decisions to the respondent for reconsideration.
   The FTTJ concluded that the only cases listed before her were those
   relating to the husband-and-wife. It would not be appropriate to remit
   the cases to the respondent without considering the decisions in relation
   to the children at the same time as the decisions in relation to the
   husband and wife. The respondent's representative took instructions and
   indicated that the respondent was not prepared to withdraw any of the
   decisions. The FTTJ decided to hear the appeals of the husband and wife;
   "which were the only cases before me".


6. The FTTJ heard oral evidence from the husband. She concluded that the
   appeals failed under paragraph 245DD and 319C(b) of the Immigration
   Rules. On the facts neither the respondent's evidential flexibility
   policy nor Rodriquez assisted the husband.


7. The FTTJ went on to consider the Article 8 human rights grounds. She
   found that the husband-and-wife had a family life with each other as
   spouses and "however, since they would return to Pakistan as a family,
   the decision would not constitute an interference with their family
   life." They had also established a private life. Considering the Article
   8 grounds both under the Immigration Rules and the pre-existing
   Strasbourg Jurisprudence the FTTJ found that there would not be an
   interference with the family life of the husband-and-wife and that
   interference with their private lives would be proportionate. She
   dismissed the appeals of the husband and wife.


8. The husband and wife applied for permission to appeal which was granted
   by a judge in the First-Tier Tribunal. The grounds submit that the FTTJ
   erred in law and that there was unfairness and procedural impropriety
   arising from the failure to link all the appeals so that the appeals of
   the husband, wife and four children were all heard and considered
   together. The FTTJ had failed to consider whether the S 47 removal
   decisions were lawful. The Article 8 ground could not be considered
   properly except in the context of the children's circumstances. There had
   been no proper consideration of the respondent's evidential flexibility
   policy or Rodriguez principles.


9. At the hearing I informed the representatives of the result of the
   enquiries made by the Tribunal staff in relation to the children's
   appeals which I have set out. They agreed that this was the position. On
   behalf the respondent Mr Avery conceded that the FTTJ erred in law by
   failing to decide that all six appeals should be heard together. The
   failure to do so was a procedural impropriety resulting in unfairness. He
   said that he would not make any submissions in relation to the other
   grounds of appeal.


10. I have studied the FTTJ's record of proceedings which is clear and
   legible. She was told that there was a query about the fees payable in
   relation to the children's appeals. I have studied the Tribunal "History
   Reports" for each of the children's appeals from which it appears that
   there was some query about the appeal fees which had been paid at this
   stage although it was subsequently resolved in the children's favour and
   their appeals were listed. Furthermore, after the respondent's
   representative indicated that she would not concede that the appeals
   should be remitted for further consideration the appellant's
   representative did not make a request for an adjournment on the basis
   that all six appeals should be linked and heard together. However, I find
   that, whether or not requested, the failure to link all six appeals and
   hear them together amounted to a procedural unfairness causing injustice.
   This is reinforced by my finding in relation to the third ground of
   appeal. The FTTJ considered only the family life of the husband and wife
   not, as was clearly required, the family life which they had with their
   four children. In paragraph 23 she refers only to the family life which
   the husband-and-wife had with each other as spouses. The subsequent
   passing reference to returning to Pakistan "as a family" is not a
   sufficient indication that the FTTJ was referring to or had considered
   all six members of the family. There is no reference to any factors
   affecting the children separately from their parents or to their best
   interests.


11. I also find that the FTTJ erred in law in her treatment of the
   respondent's evidential flexibility policy and Rodriguez principles.
   These are referred to in her findings between paragraphs 15 and 17 but
   not applied to the husband's evidence. He was not asking for the
   opportunity to submit "fresh applications" but that proper consideration
   to be given to documents submitted, albeit late. Finally, the appeals
   against the S 47 removal directions should have been considered and
   allowed.


12. I find that the FTTJ erred in law and that the decision should be set
   aside and remade by a judge in the First-Tier Tribunal.


13. The separate appeals of the husband, the wife and their four children
   should be linked and heard together. It is highly desirable that as the
   appeals of the husband and wife have got so far in advance of the appeals
   of the children that all six appeals be relisted and heard earlier than
   August 2014.
