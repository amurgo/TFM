Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Bedford, instructed by Sultan Lloyd Solictors
For the Respondent:    Mr Smart, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 (SI 2008/269) I make an anonymity order. Unless the Upper Tribunal
    or a Court directs otherwise, no report of  these  proceedings  or  any
    form of publication thereof shall directly or indirectly  identify  the
    original appellant. This direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  all
    parties. Any failure to comply with this direction could give  rise  to
    contempt of court proceedings.

 2. This appeal is against the decision dated 16 September 2014  of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Pirotta which refused the  appellant's  asylum  and
    human rights appeal.

 3. The appellant is a national of Afghanistan. He was born in 1994.

Background

 4. In order to address the grounds of appeal, it is necessary to  set  out
    the somewhat complicated details of previous litigation of this matter.
    Unless I have  specifically  indicated  otherwise,  the  references  in
    brackets below are to the page numbers  in  the  appellant's  admirably
    well-prepared bundle submitted under a cover letter dated 18  September
    2015.

    First Decision

 5. The appellant claimed asylum on 23 November 2010 after entering the  UK
    illegally.

 6. A decision refusing his asylum claim was made on 3 March 2011  (page  5
    of the respondent's bundle submitted on 17 September  2015  (RB)).  The
    decision was accompanied by a reasons for refusal letter (RFL) dated 22
    February 2011 (643-676).

 7. In another letter also dated 3 March 2011, the  appellant  was  granted
    discretionary leave to remain (DLR) on the basis of his age  (3-4  RB).
    This letter and those referred to in the previous paragraph stated that
    the respondent's view was that he was born on 1 January 1994.

 8. The appellant was also issued with an Immigration Status Document (ISD)
    showing a grant of DLR from 21 February 2011 to 1 July 2011  (6-7  RB).
    That period of leave is consistent with the respondent's view that  the
    appellant was born on 1 January 1994, granting him DLR until  6  months
    before his 18th birthday.

 9. The ISD, however, stated his age to be both 1 January 2011 (7 RB) and 8
    October 1994 (6 RB), however. This would appear to be because, contrary
    to the indications above,  the  Social  Services  age  assessment,  not
    disputed by the respondent, had found the appellant to have  been  born
    on 8 October 1994. Somehow, the 8 October 1994 date of  birth  made  it
    onto the ISD when it had not  been  included  in  the  other  documents
    issued in March 2011.

10. The calculation of DLR based  on  the  incorrect  1  January  1994  was
    important  for the appellant as it meant that he had been granted leave
    for only 7 months and no "asylum upgrade" right of appeal  arose  under
    s.83 of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act  2002  (the  2002
    Act).

11. Following the grant of DLR and issuing  of  the  ISD,  the  appellant's
    legal representatives wrote to the respondent pointing out the error as
    to the date of birth and calculation of DLR.  The  respondent  accepted
    that the correct date of birth was 8 October 1994 and  that  this  also
    meant that the grant of DLR had been calculated incorrectly. On 7  July
    2011, therefore, the respondent issued another ISD showing a  grant  of
    DLR from 21 February 2011 to 8 April 2012 (765-767).

    Second Decision

12. After further prompting from the appellant's legal representatives, the
    respondent also accepted that as the grant  of  DLR  was  now  over  12
    months, it attracted a right of  appeal  on  "asylum  upgrade"  grounds
    under s.83 of the 2002 Act.

13. On  1  September  2011,  therefore,  the  respondent  issued  a  second
    immigration decision refusing asylum as of 21 February 2011, confirming
    the grant of DLR until 8 April 2012 and  indicating  that  a  right  of
    appeal arose (775-779).

14. The appellant exercised  that  right  of  appeal.  In  a  determination
    promulgated on 31 October  2011  (807-813)  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Graham made no findings of fact on  the  appellant's  asylum  claim  or
    disputed  age,  however.  Instead,  she  remitted  the  matter  to  the
    respondent to make a new decision in line  with  the  "best  interests"
    duty under s.55 of the UK  Borders,  Citizenship  and  Immigration  Act
    2009.

15. The appellant appealed to the Upper Tribunal maintaining that  remittal
    to the respondent on  the  basis  of  that  the  decision  was  not  in
    accordance with the law was not within the Tribunal's  jurisdiction  on
    an "asylum upgrade"  appeal  under  s.83.  The  appellant  was  granted
    permission to appeal by Upper Tribunal Judge Spencer  (848-849)  on  19
    December 2011.

    Third Decision

16. It was at this point, even though the  appeal  against  Judge  Graham's
    decision to remit the appeal was outstanding before the Upper Tribunal,
    that on 4  January  2012  the  respondent  issued  another  immigration
    decision (857-859), again refusing  the  appellant's  asylum  claim.  A
    supplementary RFL dated 3 January 2012 (853-855)  issued  at  the  same
    time purports to comply with the s.55 duty so  this  third  immigration
    decision appears to have been issued in order to comply with the  terms
    of the remittal of Judge Graham.

17. The immigration decision of 4 January  2012  also  indicated  that  the
    asylum claim was refused as of 21 February 2011 but confirmed that  DLR
    was granted.  A further ISD confirmed the grant of DLR from 21 February
    2011 to 8 April 2012 (861).

18. The issuing of this third immigration decision led  to  the  litigation
    proceeding in two directions. As above, the appellant  already  had  an
    outstanding appeal arising from the second immigration decision and was
    awaiting an error of law decision from the Upper  Tribunal  on  whether
    Judge Graham had jurisdiction to remit to the respondent.

19. The appellant, faced with a further  refusal,  also  lodged  an  appeal
    against the third immigration decision of 4 January 2012.  That  appeal
    appears to have been  accepted  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal.  So  the
    appellant then also had an appeal in the  First-tier  Tribunal  against
    the third decision.

20. The decision of 4 January 2012 was sent to the Upper Tribunal  as  well
    as to the appellant. Even though permission to appeal had clearly  been
    applied for and granted to the appellant (848-849), the 4 January  2012
    letter appears to have led the Upper Tribunal to conclude that  it  was
    the respondent who had challenged Judge Graham and that new immigration
    decision was a concession by the respondent that she no longer  opposed
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Graham's remittal decision as she  had  acted
    upon it.

21. A direction (891-895) was sent out by the Upper Tribunal on 25  January
    2012  stating,  incorrectly,  that  the  Secretary  of  State  was  the
    appellant and that NK was the respondent. It went on to  indicate  that
    as the immigration decision of 4 January 2012 gave effect to the  terms
    of remittal decision  of  Judge  Graham,  unless  one  of  the  parties
    objected, the appeal to the Upper Tribunal would be dismissed  and  the
    decision of First-Tier Tribunal Judge Graham upheld. Any objection  was
    to be made by 10 February 2012.

22. The appellant, quite rightly, and in clear  terms,  did  object  (897).
    Another error occurred, however, as the objection was  not  put  before
    Upper Tribunal Judge Spencer by the deadline of 10 February  2012.  So,
    following on from the proposal in his direction, Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    Spencer dismissed the appeal  against  Judge  Graham's  decision  in  a
    determination dated 13 February 2012 (909-913).

23. The appellant finally managed to get matters back onto a proper footing
    by sending a further letter on 17 February 2012 pointing out  that  the
    Upper Tribunal judge had proceeded on  a  mistaken  basis  (915).  That
    letter was put before Upper Tribunal Judge Spencer who  proposed  in  a
    direction dated 21  March  2012  (921-925)  that  his  decision  of  13
    February 2012 should be set aside.

24. In a decision dated 4 May 2012 (929-935) Upper Tribunal  Judge  Spencer
    proceeded to set aside his decision of 13 February 2012.  That left the
    appellant's  appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  against  Judge  Graham's
    decision as it had been prior to the respondent's third decision  of  4
    January 2012, awaiting an error of law decision.

25. The respondent wrote on  29  May  2012  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  (939)
    indicating that she did not oppose the  appellant's  challenge  to  the
    decision of Judge Graham and was content for the matter to be  remitted
    to the First-tier Tribunal for the asylum appeal  to  be  heard  again,
    substantively.

26. The respondent was by then also astute to the anomaly of having  issued
    the third decision letter of 4 January 2012. In her letter dated 29 May
    2012 the respondent also indicated that the third immigration  decision
    dated 4 January 2012, issued incorrectly in response to the remittal by
    Judge Graham, was  withdrawn.  I  mention  only  in  passing  that  the
    appellant's First-tier Tribunal appeal against that decision appears to
    have fallen away somehow, as it should have  done,  but   I  could  not
    ascertain quite how that happened from the documents before me.

27. The respondent's letter of 29 May 2012 specifically referred to ongoing
    reliance on the RFL of 22 February 2011 together with the supplementary
    RFL dated 3 January 2012. I flag  that  up  here  as  the  question  of
    whether the appellant had proper knowledge of the reasons given in  the
    22 February 2011 RFL at the time of the decision under challenge before
    me formed one aspect of the grounds of appeal.

28. The result of the respondent's 29 May 2012 letter was that as  she  did
    not object to the appeal against the decision of Judge Graham and there
    was consent to the appeal being remade by the First-tier Tribunal,  the
    appeal was remitted and listed for hearing in the  First-tier  Tribunal
    on 21 September 2012 (953).

29. That left matters with appellant maintaining an appeal  to  the  First-
    tier Tribunal against the second immigration decision  of  1  September
    2011 and the respondent's case being as set out in the  RFLs  dated  22
    February 2011 and 3 January 2012.

30. That state of affairs did not last for long. On 20 September 2012,  the
    day before the case was listed for hearing, the respondent wrote to the
    First-tier Tribunal (957). The letter stated that it  was  intended  to
    withdraw "the immigration decision".

31. I set out the letter of 20 September 2012 in full as it is relevant  to
    the first ground of challenge  before  me.  It  stated  (including  the
    original emphasis):

         "A substantive appeal hearing is due to take place at Sheldon Court
         on 21 September in respect of the above-named appellant.

         In light of the findings made in the recently promulgated  case  of
         KA (Afghanistan) & Ors v Secretary of State for the Home Department
         [2012] EWCA Civ 1014 the Respondent has  decided  to  withdraw  the
         original immigration decision on this case. We will arrange for the
         claim to be reconsidered and for a new decision to be made  in  the
         near future.

         I would therefore respectfully ask  that  the  substantive  hearing
         listed for 21 September 2012 be vacated.

         I have also sent a fax to the representatives today to inform  them
         of this decision.

         I apologise for the late notification of this  withdrawal.  If  you
         have any questions about this please let me know."

32. The First Tribunal accepted the 20 September 2012 letter as  notice  of
    withdrawal of the second immigration decision  issued  on  1  September
    2011. That must be so as  that  was  the  only  extant  decision  which
    generated  a  right  of  appeal  over  which  the  Tribunal   had   any
    jurisdiction.

33. The respondent accepted  in  the  20  September  2012  letter  that  it
    remained for her to make a new decision on the appellant's asylum claim
    made on 23 November 2010.

34. It is difficult not to have sympathy for the appellant in light of what
    must have been the somewhat dizzying and dispiriting  progress  of  his
    asylum claim and appeal. That is additionally so as he was still, as of
    September 2012, even on the  respondent's  assessment  of  his  age,  a
    minor.

    The Fourth Decision

35. Meanwhile, a very attentive reader will have noted  that  by  the  time
    that  the  respondent  withdrew  her  asylum  refusal  decision  on  20
    September 2012, the DLR granted from 21 February 2011 to 8  April  2012
    (see 11] above) had come to an end.

36. Given the matters set out above, it did not seem to me  that  much,  if
    any, criticism could attract to the appellant or his legal advisers for
    not seeking to extend in time. The appellant can be  presumed  to  have
    had section 3C "roll over"  leave  until  20  September  2012  and  the
    representatives did not take long to pick up on the lapse of  his  DLR,
    raising this with the respondent in a letter of 22 November 2012  (959-
    1055).

37. The letter of 22 November 2012 (959-1055) set out  an  application  for
    leave to remain on asylum, humanitarian  protection  and  human  rights
    grounds "further to his grant of Discretionary Leave  to  Remain  which
    has expired".  The respondent queried this  in  further  correspondence
    (1057), making a reference, albeit in somewhat confused terms,  to  the
    earlier appeal having been withdrawn leaving a decision on the November
    2010 asylum claim outstanding. In  a  letter  dated  21  February  2013
    (1063) the appellant continued to maintain that he  wished  to  protect
    his legal position by making an application for  an  extension  of  his
    DLR.

38. The respondent responded in a  letter  dated  14  March  2013   (1065),
    stating:

         "I will register your client's HPDL application. Your  client  will
         receive  a  decision  in  due  course  which  will   consider   his
         application, taking into account any information provided with  his
         HPDL form, as well as the reasons for the appeal being withdrawn. I
         cannot provide a timescale for the decision."

39. A fourth immigration decision was eventually issued 9 months  later  on
    23 December 2013.

40. The decision is headed "REFUSAL TO VARY LEAVE TO ENTER  OR  REMAIN  AND
    DECISION TO REMOVE" and goes on to refer to a "DECISION  TO  REFUSE  TO
    REMAIN  (sic)"  (1095).  The  cover   letter   (1071)   refers   to   a
    "DETERMINATION OF APPLICATION FOR FURTHER LEAVE" and (1095-1099).

41. The decision indicates the respondent did not accept that the appellant
    had made out an asylum, humanitarian protection or human rights  claim.
    The accompanying RFL dated 23 December 2013 states at paragraph 1  that
    "On 22 November 2012 you made  an  application  for  further  leave  to
    remain in the United Kingdom" and "The purpose of this review  of  your
    case is to determine whether you qualify for further leave to remain".

42. The appellant exercised his right of appeal against the decision of  23
    December 2013. It was dismissed  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Freer  in  a
    decision dated 15 February 2014. That decision was set aside for  error
    of  law  by  Deputy  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Juss  in  a  determination
    promulgated on 10 June 2014. Fortunately, there was agreement that  the
    substance of those decisions does not relate directly to the  challenge
    before me, and I do not need to go into them further here.

43. Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Juss remitted the appeal to be  re-made  by
    First-tier Tribunal. It was heard by  Judge  Pirotta  on  10  September
    2014. It is the challenge to her determination dated 16 September  2014
    that is before me.

Error of Law Decision

44. The grounds of appeal before me are dated 26 September 2014. They argue
    in the body of the first paragraph on the first  page  that  First-tier
    Tribunal  Judge Pirotta erred in failing to take into account that  the
    appellant:

         "...  has  been  denied  a  determination  of  his  initial  asylum
         application. What is more, A has been denied  an  effective  remedy
         within the meaning of article 39 of Direction  2005/85,  namely  an
         independent decision by the Tribunal with  compulsory  jurisdiction
         over the merits of his asylum application of 23 November 2010."

45. I accept that in her letter dated  20  September  2012  the  respondent
    withdrew a decision on the appellant's asylum claim made on 23 November
    2010.

46. The wording of the immigration decision and RFL dated 23 December  2013
    set out at [40] and [41]  above  refers  only  to  a  decision  on  the
    application to vary or extend leave. It does not, superficially, appear
    to be a decision on the asylum claim made in November 2010.

47. It remains the case that I did not find this ground  to  be  made  out.
    Notwithstanding the complicated history and wording  of  the  documents
    issued by the respondent on 23 December 2013, the reason  for  this  is
    relatively simple.

48. The appellant's application  for  further  leave  to  remain  dated  22
    November 2012 (959-977) stated on the second  page  under  the  heading
    "Asylum Claim":

         "Our client continues to fear persecution in  Afghanistan  for  the
         reasons he has already given in his initial asylum claim."

    Nothing in the further leave to  remain  application  suggests  that  a
    claim on any other basis was being or had been made. The applicant  was
    relying on the same asylum claim in the 2010 and 2012 applications.

49. In my judgement,  the  immigration  decision  dated  23  December  2013
    refuses that asylum claim.  It refuses the  asylum  claim  made  on  22
    November 2012 in terms. It was the appellant's  case  that  the  asylum
    claim made on 22 November 2012 was the same as that  made  in  November
    2010.  The decision and  RFL  of  23  December  2013  therefore  acted,
    certainly in substance, as a refusal of the appellant's asylum claim.

50. A purist might argue that an immigration decision worded as  a  refusal
    of leave rather than a refusal of a variation or extension of leave was
    required in order to address the claim made in November 2010.  Even  if
    that point were accepted, it is not material here as it unarguable that
    the appellant has had access  to  "an  effective  remedy"  against  the
    refusal of his substantive asylum claim  made  in  November  2010.  The
    proceedings before me are a part of  that  remedy,  an  appeal  on  the
    merits to the Immigration and Asylum Chamber.

51. Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the grounds state:

         "1. erroneously, the learned Judge permitted  [the  respondent]  to
         rely on the reasons for refusal  letter  of  22  February  2011  to
         maintain [the respondent's] assessment  of  [the  appellant's]  age
         when the same had been withdrawn, which  was  unfair  because  [the
         appellant] relied on the otherwise unchallenged age assessments  of
         Dr Birch, which he would have supported with a further  independent
         assessment of his age if the same had been challenged;

         2. the point is material also because the learned Judge  relied  on
         the material in the refusal letter of  22  February  2011  and  the
         Social services age assessments  to  make  an  adverse  credibility
         finding against [the appellant] at �43 to 50 of her determination"

52. As I understood it, the argument here starts with the premise  that  if
    the first, second and third immigration decisions  were  superseded  or
    withdrawn, then the accompanying RFLs also fell away  and  neither  the
    respondent nor the First-tier  Tribunal   were  entitled  to  take  any
    points from those RFLs in this appeal  which  arose  from  an  entirely
    different decision.

53. I did not accept that argument. The 22 February 2011 RFL  was  referred
    to in terms at paragraph 11 of the RFL dated 23 December 2013  and  was
    included in the materials relied upon by the respondent in  her  appeal
    bundle. The respondent clearly intended to rely upon it, the  appellant
    knew that. The First-tier Tribunal would have been remiss if it had not
    taken it into account.

54. In addition, the appellant's age assessment report from  Dr  Birch  and
    the Social Services assessments were  also  included  in  the  material
    relied upon by the respondent  in  the  appeal  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal. The appellant also knew that those  documents  were  live  as
    well, therefore.

55. If more were needed, the appellant addressed these points made  against
    him in the 22 February 2011 RFL in his witness  statement  dated  (309-
    327) prepared for his appeal in the  First-tier  Tribunal  against  the
    decision dated 23 December 2013 and before Judge Pirotta.

56. The appellant points  out,  correctly,  in  my  view,  in  the  witness
    statement at [3] that the RFL dated 23 December 2011 was lacking by way
    of reasoning but accepts that:

         "The only thing that I  can  do  is  provide  the  Court  with  the
         responses that I made to the original asylum claim, which I  assume
         that the SSHD continues to rely upon in refusing me leave to remain
         in the UK. Although the decision has been  withdrawn  by  the  Home
         Office I have no other explanation as to why my  asylum  claim  has
         been refused."

57. He then goes on to address expressly the respondent's case as  set  out
    in the 22 February 2011 RFL If that was how  the  appellant  approached
    the case before the First-tier Tribunal, Judge Pirotta was entitled  to
    proceed on the same basis.

58. As above, there are certainly shortcomings in the reasoning of  the  23
    December 2013 RFL. At paragraphs 13 and 20-24, the RFL of  23  December
    seriously misstates the  history  of  the  case,  suggesting  that  the
    Tribunal had made substantive adverse findings in the  previous  appeal
    when none were ever made and there  remained  no  substantive  Tribunal
    decision at all where the appeal was withdrawn on 20 September 2012. At
    paragraph 22 there is an  inaccurate  citation  of  Devaseelan  (Second
    Appeals - ECHR - Extra-Territorial Effect) Sri  Lanka  *  [2002]  UKIAT
    00702 and wholly inaccurate and  misleading  purported  quotation  from
    [39] of that case, not relevant  in  any  event  where  there  were  no
    previous substantive findings to  act  as  a  starting  point  in  this
    appeal.

59. Notwithstanding those matters, it is not arguable that the letter of 23
    December 2013 gave the appellant any expectation that his  claimed  age
    or asylum claim were accepted. It clearly indicated that they were  not
    even if the reasoning was defective. His witness statement  shows  that
    he prepared for the appeal on the basis that his claim was not accepted
    and that he was aware of the respondent's view as to why that was so.

60. It is therefore my conclusion that First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Pirotta
    was entitled to take the respondent's case to be that set  out  in  the
    RFLs dated 22 February 2011 and 23 December  2013.  That  was  how  the
    appellant had approached the appeal.  She was equally entitled to  rely
    on the age assessment documents, not, in fact, commented on in the RFLs
    but clearly in evidence and relied upon by the  parties  who  had  good
    notice of the other side's case.

61. Paragraphs 7 and 8 of the grounds are somewhat  similar,  arguing  that
    Judge Pirotta erred in failing to find  material  detriment  where  the
    appellant did not have an appeal at the time that he was  a  minor  and
    the asylum system had operated against him unfairly.

62. The history of the appellant's asylum claim does not make happy reading
    as I indicate at [34] above but this is not sufficient to  support  the
    assertion of material detriment in the grounds. Why would the appellant
    have been in a materially better position if his appeal  had  proceeded
    whilst he was a minor? Setting aside the errors on the  part  of  those
    responsible for progressing his claim, there is no right to a  decision
    and an appeal whilst an appellant remains a minor.  It  is  commonplace
    for a claim by a minor to proceed to appeal only after  the  individual
    has attained majority. The material before me doe  not  show  that  the
    appellant can benefit substantively either in his protection  claim  or
    his Article 8 ECHR claim from the maladministration detailed above. The
    grounds, therefore, do not show error in Judge  Pirotta's  approach  at
    [51] and [64] or in her Article 8 ECHR assessment

63. The ground at paragraph 3 maintains that the First-tier Tribunal made a
    material error of fact in recording at [52]-[57] that the appellant had
    failed to provide tracing information to the Red Cross for  a  maternal
    uncle in Afghanistan.

64. Judge Pirotta records at [52] that

         "He did not advise the Red Cross that he  had  maternal  uncles  in
         Afghanistan, much less any paternal uncles.  He  said  in  evidence
         that he did not want them to be found as he was only interested  in
         meeting up with his brother."

65. At [53] she records:

         "The Appellant agreed he deliberately chose not to reveal  that  he
         had relatives in  Afghanistan,  because  he  did  not  want  to  be
         returned there."

66. If this ground is arguing that the appellant did not say  these  things
    but said, as in the grounds, that he gave information to the Red  Cross
    about his uncles but was only concerned to trace his brother, it cannot
    succeed where it fails to provide any kind  of  record  of  proceedings
    showing the supposedly correct version of his evidence. No request  was
    made for Judge Pirotta's record of proceedings in order to support this
    ground. There is no statement from the  appellant  clarifying  what  he
    said.

67. Further, the statements of the appellant recorded by Judge Pirotta  bat
    [52] and [53] are consistent with a Red Cross letter  dated  3  January
    2014 (1101) referred only to the appellant making a tracing enquiry for
    his  brother.  They  are  consistent  with  the  information   in   the
    appellant's family tracing questionnaire dated 3  February  2012  (901-
    903) which provided details only of his brother.

68. It has not been shown, therefore, that Judge Pirotta erred  in  finding
    that the appellant had not provided details of his maternal  uncles  to
    the Red Cross and the argument at paragraph 3 of  the  grounds  has  no
    merit.

69. The ground at paragraph 4 maintains that the First-tier Tribunal made a
    material error of fact in stating at  the  appellant  withheld  tracing
    information about his maternal uncles from  the  respondent.  This  was
    stated to be an error as the appellant had provided their names and the
    names of their village in his first witness statement dated 12  January
    2011 (573-579).

70. It is correct that the witness statement at [10] and [11]  gives  names
    for two maternal uncles and the names of  the  village  in  which  they
    lived. However, this  submission  loses  force  where  it  ignores  the
    omission of the uncles' details from the family  tracing  questionnaire
    dated 3 February 2012 (901-903), the document  specifically  issued  in
    order to assist in tracing  and  the  lack  of  any  reference  to  the
    maternal uncles in the Red Cross letter (1101).

71. Further, the comment objected to here would appear to be at [54]  where
    Judge Pirotta states "He did not disclose adequate information  to  the
    Home Office" and that the information given was "sketchy". It  did  not
    appear  to  me  that  this  could  be  properly  characterised   as   a
    "fundamental mistake of fact" given that the limited  details  at  [10]
    and [1] in the witness statement were all  that  was  provided  on  the
    appellant's uncles.

72. It is my conclusion that it has not been  shown  that  Judge  Pirotta's
    conclusion and negative inference arising  from  the  failure  to  give
    proper disclosure of details of the appellant's uncles  was  erroneous.
    This ground 4 is not made out.

73. The ground at paragraph 5 maintains that the First-tier Tribunal failed
    to consider the country evidence from the time that the appellant  left
    Afghanistan which indicated a high level of  Taliban  activity  in  his
    home area, consistent with his asylum claim.  Mr  Bedford  took  me  to
    country  evidence  relating  to  Kunduz  province,  however,  which  he
    maintained Judge Pirotta had overlooked but this  ground  has  to  fail
    where the appellant's case is that he is  from  Baghlan  province.   He
    states this in his witness statements of 12 January 2011  (573-579),  6
    October 2011 which at [10]   specifically  contrasts  his  position  as
    someone from Baghlan with someone from Kunduz, (69-82), the same  point
    being made at [12] of the undated statement at 309-328 of his bundle.

74. I should perhaps also point out that I had some  difficulty  with  this
    submission where Mr Bedford took me to one sentence in the  body  of  a
    UNCHR report and some footnotes to that report which was contained in a
    1252 page bundle. There was no skeleton argument or list  of  essential
    reading from the hearing before Judge Pirotta to show that she had been
    taken to this or other specific country evidence.  Where  it  comprised
    only one sentence in the body of text and otherwise consisted  of  foot
    notes it was not my view that it was likely that  it  could  have  been
    shown an error of law occurred in overlooking this material even had it
    related to the correct province.

75.  The  same  reasons  must  significantly  undermine  the  arguments  at
    paragraph 6 of the grounds which seeks to rely on the UNHCR  report  in
    combination with an attack on Judge Pirotta's approach to assessing the
    evidence of someone who was a minor at the time of the  claimed  events
    in Afghanistan.

76. At [38] Judge Pirotta specifically indicated that she took into account
    the appellant's age and relative inexperience in giving  evidence  when
    he first applied  for  asylum  and  how  his  age  "would  prevent  his
    understanding of relevant facts then and now." That  self-direction  is
    more than sufficient to show that she took a correct  approach  in  her
    assessment of the evidence of someone who was a minor at  the  time  of
    the events he was recounting and was still so when he claimed asylum in
    the UK. Nothing in the determination offends the principles set out  at
    [38]-[42] of AA (unattended  children)  (Afghanistan)  CG  [2012]  UKUT
    00016 (IAC). Ground 6 has no merit.

77. For all of these reasons, I do not find that the grounds show an  error
    of law in the determination of First-tier Tribunal Judge Pirotta.

Decision

78. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal does not contain an error on  a
    point of law and shall stand.
