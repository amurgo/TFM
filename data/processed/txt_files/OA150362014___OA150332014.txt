Representation:
For the Appellants:    None
For the Respondent:    Mr I Richards, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants are citizens of the USA who were born on  4  April  1978
    and 17 May 2000 respectively.  They are mother and daughter.

 2. On 3 September 2014, the appellants each applied for entry clearance to
    join the first appellant's husband ([AG]) in the UK under  Appendix  FM
    of the Immigration Rules (HC 395 as amended).

 3.  On  31  October  2014,  the  ECO  refused  each  of  the   appellants'
    applications.  First, the ECO was not satisfied that  the  relationship
    between the first appellant and sponsor was a  genuine  and  subsisting
    one and that they intended to live together permanently as required  by
    E-ECP2.2 and 2.10 of Appendix FM.  Secondly, the ECO was not  satisfied
    that the appellant met the financial requirements  in  Appendix  FM  in
    that the submitted documentation did not show that the sponsor's  gross
    income was at least �22,400 as required by E-ECP.3.1 of Appendix FM.

 4. Subsequently, the Entry Clearance Manager on 19 January 2015 upheld the
    ECO's decision but only with  specific  reference  to  the  appellants'
    failure to establish  that  they  met  the  financial  requirements  of
    Appendix FM.  The ECM made no reference to the alternative  basis  upon
    which the ECO had refused the applications,  namely  that  it  was  not
    established that the  relationship  between  the  first  appellant  and
    sponsor was a genuine and subsisting one and that they intended to live
    together permanently.

The Appeal to the First-tier Tribunal

 5. The appellants appealed to  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   They  did  not
    request a hearing and so the appeal was dealt with by  Judge  Myers  on
    the papers.

 6. In her determination  promulgated  on  22  October  2015,  Judge  Myers
    dismissed each of the appellants' appeals.  First,  she  accepted  that
    the ECM had conceded that the relationship between the first  appellant
    and sponsor met the requirements for the Rules.  Secondly, however,  on
    the basis of the  sponsor's  financial  documents,  in  particular  his
    accounts for the financial year 2013-2014 and his  self-assessment  tax
    return for that financial year, the judge was not  satisfied  that  the
    sponsor had an income of at least �22,400.  Thirdly,  the  judge  found
    that the respondent's decisions did not breach Art 8 of the ECHR.

The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

 7. The appellants sought permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.   The
    grounds rely upon two matters.  First, reliance is placed upon evidence
    of maintenance payments made to  the  first  appellant  by  her  former
    partner in respect of their child, the second appellant under an  order
    of the Superior Court of California in  the  sum  of  $461  per  month.
    Secondly, reliance is placed upon financial documents  of  the  sponsor
    relating to the tax year 2014-2015 (including bank  statements)  which,
    it is said, demonstrate that his gross income exceeds �22,400.

 8. On 7 June 2016,  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Ford)  granted  the
    appellants permission to appeal.

 9. On 22 June 2016, the ECO filed a rule 24 response seeking to uphold the
    judge's decisions.

10. Thus, the appeals came before me.





The Appeals

11. Although these are entry clearance appeals, at the  hearing  before  me
    both appellants attended.  The first appellant explained that  she  and
    her daughter had been granted entry clearance as visitors in June  2015
    and had remained in  the  UK  (she  said  with  the  knowledge  of  the
    immigration authorities) whilst the appeals were concluded.   She  told
    me that, in addition to the second appellant, she had travelled to  the
    UK with her and the sponsor's two children.  They are British  citizens
    and at the date of the ECO's decision were aged 10 and 6 years  of  age
    respectively.

12. The first appellant drew my attention to  the  order  of  the  Superior
    Court of California ordering the second appellant's father to  pay  the
    first appellant monthly  maintenance  of  $461.   The  first  appellant
    accepted  that  these  documents  had  not  been  submitted  with   the
    application but had been submitted for the  appeal  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

13. In addition, the first appellant said that she wished to rely upon  Art
    8 and, in particular, referred to the fact that her two  children  were
    British citizens in the UK.  They were now 11 and 7 years old and  were
    enrolled in school.  She told me that she had been homeless in the  USA
    but had not raised this  as  part  of  the  appeal  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  In addition, the first appellant (and sponsor) told me  that
    the sponsor could not live in the USA  because  he  had  been  arrested
    there and so would be unable to obtain a visa.  However, again, it  was
    accepted that this had not been raised in the material submitted to the
    judge.

14. On behalf of the ECO, Mr Richards submitted that  the  judge  had  been
    correct to find that  the  appellants  could  not  meet  the  financial
    requirements of Appendix FM  based  upon  the  documentation  that  was
    required by Appendix FM-SE.  He invited me to dismiss  the  appeals  on
    all grounds.

Discussion

15. Under Appendix FM, the appellants had to  establish  on  the  basis  of
    "specified evidence" a "gross annual income"  of  at  least  �18,600  +
    �3,800 = �22,400 (see E-ECP.3.1).  That financial  requirement  may  be
    established, on the basis of "specified evidence", taking together  the
    sponsor's income from his employment or self-employment and also  other
    specified income of the appellants (see E-ECP3.2).  By virtue  of  para
    1(b)(i) of Appendix FM-SE account may be taken of maintenance  payments
    made to the first appellant by a former partner for the maintenance  of
    the second appellant.

16. In relation to the sponsor's income,  Appendix  FM-SE  requires,  inter
    alia, that the required income be established from his  self-employment
    by documents relating to the last financial year  (for  these  purposes
    2013-2014) including his annual self-assessment tax return to the  HMRC
    and a statement of his accounts (see para 7(b) of Appendix FM-SE).  The
    maintenance agreement must be evidenced by  a  court  order  (see  para
    10(d)(i)(1) of Appendix FM-SE_.

17. In para 7 of her determination,  the  judge  noted  that  the  ECM  had
    conceded the genuineness of the first appellant's relationship with the
    sponsor and Mr Richards, before me, has not sought to argue  otherwise.



18. Then, at para 7 Judge Myers dealt with the documents  relating  to  the
    claimed self-employment from his business as follows:

         "Unfortunately, the appeal documents do little to address the issue
         of compliance with the financial requirement.  It appears that  the
         Sponsor is self-employed with a business turnover  of  �50,000  per
         annum.  His accounts show that he took drawings of �21,478 for  the
         financial year ending April 2014 however the  documents  from  HMRC
         show that he had an income of �15,290 for the  same  year,  and  as
         both amounts are below the required income of �22,400 for a partner
         and dependent they have not met the  financial  requirement  and  I
         must dismiss the appeals under the Immigration Rules."

19. The figures set out by the judge in relation to the  sponsor's  claimed
    income for the financial year 2013-2014 are correct.  And,  of  course,
    it was only by reference to the "last full financial  year"  (see  para
    7(b) of Appendix FM-SE) that the appellants could seek to establish the
    required income.  Neither document discloses a  "gross  income"  of  at
    least �22,400.  The sponsor's tax return for 2013-2014 shows a  taxable
    income of �15,290 which is, in fact, made up of an employment income of
    �3,909 and a self-employed profit of �11,381.  No issue is  taken  that
    part of the income is derived from employment.  That is  the  sponsor's
    taxable gross income  and  falls  considerably  short  of  the  �22,400
    required.  The sponsor's  accounts  show  a  gross  taxable  income  of
    �21,478.  The total of �50,217 set out in the accounts is the  turnover
    of the sponsor's business and does  not  represent  his  "gross  annual
    income" which must be the figure after  all  expenses  are  taken  into
    account which then reflects his pre-tax "gross annual income".  In  his
    accounts, that figure is �21,478 which also falls short  (albeit  by  a
    somewhat lesser an amount) of the required �22,400.

20. At best, therefore, these two documents read together establish no more
    than the sponsor's gross annual income was �15,290.  On that basis, the
    appellants could not succeed in establishing the financial requirements
    of Appendix FM.

21. What, however, of the maintenance payment?  It is not entirely clear to
    me from the papers  that  the  document  relating  to  the  maintenance
    payment made in respect of the second appellant was, in fact,  included
    in  the  bundle  before  the  judge  rather  than  included  with   the
    application for permission to appeal.  However, I am content to  accept
    the  first  appellant's  statement  that  the  relevant   court   order
    disclosing a monthly maintenance payment of $461 was before the  judge.
    It was not considered by him.

22. However, even if  the  judge  was  required  to  take  the  maintenance
    payments into account, and had he done so, the appellants  still  could
    not succeed in  establishing  the  required  income  of  �22,400.   The
    sponsor's documents, read together, showed no more than a gross  annual
    income of �15,290.  The maintenance payments  amounted  to  $6,132  per
    year.  Even if that figure were in sterling, added to the  �15,290,  it
    would still fall short of �22,400.  However, in  fact,  any  applicable
    exchange rate converting $6,132 into sterling would  only  reduce  that
    figure such that when added to the sponsor's income there would  be  an
    even greater shortfall in reaching the required �22,400.

23. Accordingly, the appellants could not  succeed  under  the  Immigration
    Rules on the evidence before the Judge.

24. Although the appellants  have  submitted  further  financial  documents
    relating to the sponsor, these do not relate to the relevant  financial
    year namely 2013-2014.   Appendix  FM-SE  required  the  appellants  to
    establish the requisite "gross  income"  solely  by  reference  to  the
    sponsor's income in the tax year 2013-2014.  The documents relating  to
    future tax  years  cannot,  at  least  in  these  appeals,  assist  the
    appellants to establish the requirements of the Rules.

25. For these reasons, the judge's  decision  to  dismiss  the  appellants'
    appeals under the Immigration Rules did not involve a material error of
    law and that decision stands.

26. Although not raised in the grounds of appeal to the Upper Tribunal, the
    first appellant sought,  at  the  hearing,  to  challenge  the  judge's
    decision to dismiss the appeal under Art 8.

27. The judge's reasons for dismissing the appeal under Art 8 are  set  out
    in para 8 of her determination as follows:

         "8.  In this appeal I find that the Appellants have not shown  that
             there are any compelling circumstances  not  recognised  under
             the Immigration Rules which  would  amount  to  arguably  good
             grounds for leave to be granted outside the Rules.  Article  8
             is not an absolute right and does not entitle  the  Appellants
             and Sponsor to their choice of country of residence  in  which
             to enjoy their family life.  Other than a bare assertion,  the
             Appellants have not given a reason why the Sponsor  is  unable
             to return to the USA to live with the Appellants and establish
             his business in that country.  I recognise that the other  two
             children of the marriage are living with the Sponsor in the UK
             and are therefore separated from the Appellants,  however  the
             separation has come about  by  choice  and  all  the  evidence
             before me from the school  and  family  photographs  indicates
             that the children are happy and are doing well."

28. Before me, the first appellant relied upon the fact  that  two  of  her
    children were British citizens and were in the  UK.   The  judge  noted
    that at para 8 of his determination.  However, it is  clear  from  what
    the first appellant told me that at the date of  the  ECO's  decisions,
    namely 31 October 2014, both the first appellant and her children  were
    in the USA.  They only came to the UK in  June  2015.   The  judge  was
    required to consider the circumstances as they appertained at the  date
    of  the  ECO's  decision  alone  (see  s.85A(2)  of  the   Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act  2002)  as  these  were  appeals  against  a
    refusal of entry clearance.  The  position  was,  therefore,  that  all
    three children lived with the first appellant but,  at  least  to  that
    extent, there was separation from the  sponsor  rather  than  from  the
    first appellant as the judge stated.  However, the judge clearly  found
    that there was no evidence to indicate why the sponsor could not return
    to the USA to live with the first  appellant  and  the  children  as  a
    family.  Although the first appellant and sponsor told  me  that  there
    were difficulties with  him  obtaining  a  visa  because  he  had  been
    arrested in the USA, it was accepted that that evidence was not  before
    the judge.  It was, therefore, properly open to the judge to find  that
    there was no reason why the sponsor, despite his self-employment in the
    UK, could not continue his family life in the USA.

29. The appellants could not meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules
    and there was  very  limited  evidence  before  the  judge  as  to  the
    circumstances and impact upon the family other than  their  separation.
    The fact that the sponsor was working in the UK was not a  "compelling"
    circumstance sufficient to outweigh the public  interest  in  effective
    immigration control (see s.117B(1) of the NIA Act 2002).  The judge was
    right to take into account that Art 8 did  not  confer  an  entitlement
    upon the first appellant and sponsor to continue their family  life  in
    the UK in circumstances where the requirements of the  Rules  were  not
    met.

30. The judge took into account the evidence before him from the children's
    schools (which necessarily related to the circumstances after the ECO's
    decision).  The first appellant drew my attention to a letter from  her
    attached to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  appeal  form  which  she  said,
    although undated, dated from July/August 2015.  Whilst  this  described
    the family's circumstances and refers  to,  what  the  first  appellant
    described before me, as their homelessness in the USA, it  states  that
    the appellants are accommodated by her parents but that  from  December
    (which  must  mean  in  context  December  2015)  their  residence   is
    "uncertain".  That also is a matter  post-dating  the  ECO's  decision.
    The judge was required to assess the appellants' Art 8 claims as at the
    date of the ECO's decision (s.85A(2), NIA Act 2002).  I  am  unable  to
    identify any error of  law  in  her  conclusion  that,  given  all  the
    circumstances, the appellants have failed to establish a breach of  Art
    8 on the basis that their circumstances are sufficiently compelling  as
    to outweigh the public interest given  that  they  cannot  establish  a
    basis for entering the UK under the Rules.

31. For these reasons, the judge's decision to dismiss  the  appeals  under
    Art 8 also stands.

32. The judge's decision, of course, only relates to the  circumstances  as
    at the date of the ECO's decision in October 2014.  As I understood the
    first  appellant  and  sponsor,  both  their  personal  and   financial
    circumstances have changed since that date.  However, those matters can
    only be relevant in any future applications made by the  appellants  to
    enter the UK.  They were not matters which the judge could consider and
    are not properly matters for me to consider in this further appeal.

Decision

33. For the above reasons, the First-tier Tribunal's  decision  to  dismiss
    the appellants' appeals under the Rules and Art 8 did not  involve  the
    making of a material error of law.  The decision stands.
