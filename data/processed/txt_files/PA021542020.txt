For the Appellant:     Mr Hussain, Counsel instructed by BA Chambers
For the Respondent:    Mr Diwnycz, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Afghanistan born  in  1991.  He  appeals
    with permission against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  (Judge
    Atkinson) to dismiss his protection appeal.

 2. The basis of the Appellant's claim was that as a member of  the  Afghan
    National Army he had come to the adverse attention of the  Taliban.  He
    had left the army  after  only  6  months  due  to  their  threats.  He
    thereafter opened a grocery store near a bridge along  the  Kabul-Logar
    highway. Unfortunately this only increased the  Taliban's  interest  in
    him, as due to the location of his store they accused him  of  being  a
    spy for the Americans. His shop  was  shot  at  and  broken  into.  The
    Appellant continues to fear persecution  for  reasons  of  his  imputed
    political opinion.

 3. The Respondent refused to grant protection. It was  accepted  that  the
    Appellant had joined the Afghan National Army in 2010 but not  that  he
    had been threatened by the  Taliban.  The  Respondent  argued,  in  the
    alternative, that the Appellant could avoid any  persecution  from  the
    Taliban by relocating within Afghanistan, for instance to Kabul.

 4. In evaluating the claim on appeal the First-tier Tribunal therefore had
    to make findings on three matters:

              i) Was the Appellant's account of threats  credible,  applying
                 the lower standard of proof;

             ii) Is the Appellant's fear  of  the  Taliban  currently  well-
                 founded;

            iii)  Could  the  Appellant  reasonably  be  expected  to  avoid
                 persecution by relocation to Kabul.

 5. By its decision dated the 20th November 2020  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    resolved all of these issues in the Respondent's favour and the  appeal
    was dismissed.

 6. The Appellant was granted permission to appeal by the Upper Tribunal on
    the 18th January 2021. The first ground of appeal is that the  Tribunal
    erred in "adopting plausibility as a criterion". The second  ground  is
    that the Tribunal failed to take material  matters  into  account,   in
    particular the  expert  evidence  of  Dr  Antonio  Giustozzi,  who  had
    commented upon the risk faced by the Appellant as a former soldier, and
    upon how Covid-19 had impacted upon the informal job market in Kabul.

 7. Before me Mr Hussain concentrated his  submissions  on  the  second  of
    these grounds.  He did so in acknowledgment of the fact that  in  order
    to succeed the Appellant needed to discharge the  burden  of  proof  in
    respect of matters (ii) and (iii) at paragraph 4 above.  The outcome of
    the credibility assessment - matter (i)  -  was  not  determinative  of
    either.  The  Appellant  might  be  entirely  honest  about  his   past
    experiences but still  fail  to  establish  a  current  entitlement  to
    refugee status; equally he may be lying but still be at risk.

 8. For the Respondent Mr Diwnycz submitted that in respect of matter (iii)
    above the Tribunal  was  obliged  to  apply  the  very  recent  country
    guidance, and that being so, its findings on (i) and (ii) were  largely
    irrelevant for the purpose of this appeal.   He  further  relied  on  a
    written 'rule 24'  response  prepared  by  his  colleague  SPO  Mrs  R.
    Pettersen, which  defended  the  Tribunal's  approach  the  Appellant's
    overall credibility.



    Discussion and Findings

 9. The written grounds make extensive reference to the Tribunal's  alleged
    reliance upon plausibility as a criterion for rejecting the Appellant's
    evidence. This ground was wisely ignored by Mr  Hussain.  The  Tribunal
    does not in fact reject evidence on the  grounds  of  plausibility.  It
    rejects certain parts of the Appellant's evidence on the basis that  it
    is vague, and because the Appellant was unable to provide the  Tribunal
    with a coherent chronology of the events  he  described.  The  Tribunal
    accepted that dates can be difficult to recall, but reasoned  that  the
    order in which things happened are more likely to be fixed in the  mind
    if the account narrated is true. That  is  not  reasoning  that  I  can
    legitimately interfere with.

10. The grounds next take issue with the approach taken to the evidence  of
    Dr Antonio Giustozzi. No issue was taken, either here  or  below,  with
    the value of Dr Giustozzi's expertise. He has been acknowledged  as  an
    expert in successive 'country guidance'  cases.  His  report  for  this
    appeal is dated the 21st September 2020. It was his considered  opinion
    that letters such as those purportedly sent to  the  Appellant  by  the
    Taliban, warning him about his  conduct  and  threatening  him,  are  a
    genuine feature of life in those parts of Afghanistan where the Taliban
    continue to hold sway. As such it was  plausible,  in  his  view,  that
    someone who had voluntarily joined the Afghan army, or be suspected  as
    a collaborator, might receive such threats. The  Tribunal  declined  to
    place any significant weight on  this  commentary,  however,  since  Dr
    Giustozzi had not considered the evidence that such  letters  are  also
    routinely provided to would-be refugees  by  the  agents  who  organise
    their passage to  Europe.  The  grounds  mischaracterise  this  as  the
    Tribunal "dismissing" Dr Giustozzi's evidence. That  is  not  what  the
    Tribunal did. The Tribunal simply noted that the  commentary  that  the
    account was  plausible  had  to  be  balanced  against  the  apparently
    unchallenged evidence that such letters can also be  forged.  In  other
    words, the evidence was neutral and did not advance the case one way or
    the other.

11. Now the grounds turn to the meat of the  claim,  at  least  as  it  was
    advanced by Mr Hussain before me.  It is submitted that the  First-tier
    Tribunal erred in apparently regarding its findings on the threats made
    to the Appellant - or lack of them - as determinative. It  had  already
    been accepted that he had been a soldier for the  ANA,  and  there  was
    significant evidence before the Tribunal to demonstrate that  he  could
    be at risk for that reason alone. The grounds cite paragraph 5.3 of the
    CPIN, the material substance of which is that persons  associated  with
    the Afghan authorities, whether past or present,  are  "systematically"
    targeted by Anti-Government Elements (AGEs). That the  Appellant  could
    face a risk of harm as a former  soldier  was  also  emphasised  by  Dr
    Giustozzi. He points out that it is the  Taliban's  modus  operandi  to
    threaten those that they consider to be collaborators.  He writes  that
    the Taliban continue to enforce death sentences passed by them even  if
    these related to historic 'crimes': he gives the  example  of  a  shura
    judgement relating to the 2000 hijacking of a plane.  They  maintain  a
    'blacklist' of those whom they perceive to be government collaborators.
     They do not prioritise them  in  order  of  importance,  but  they  do
    concentrate on high ranking officials and those whose deaths will cause
    the greatest level of shock.   Information  provided  to  Dr  Giustozzi
    indicates that as of August 2019 there were approximately 1500  Taliban
    fighters still stationed in Logar, as well as an estimated 300  members
    of 'Islamic' State.  As to the position in Kabul, Dr  Giustozzi  writes
    that there is a significant infiltration of Taliban in  the  city,  and
    that they continue to carry out terrorist operations such  as  bombings
    and assassinations.  Anybody who appears on their blacklist could be at
    risk, although their  priority  are  those  currently  associated  with
    foreign interests.

12. Mr Hussain relied heavily on this evidence to submit that the  Tribunal
    conducted only half a risk assessment.  At its �44 the Tribunal rejects
    all aspects of the account  that  had  been  placed  in  issue  by  the
    Respondent. It rejects the core of the account of being threatened  and
    having fled as a result. Then at its �45 the Tribunal says this:

         "I  therefore  find  that  if  the  appellant  were  to  return  to
         Afghanistan,  he  would  not  be  targeted  by  the  Taliban  as  a
         collaborator or a spy"

13. I accept Mr Hussain has a point.  The  case  did  not,  for  reasons  I
    summarise above, begin and end with the Appellant's claim that  he  had
    been threatened by the Taliban. It was  evident  from  the  submissions
    made on his behalf, and from the views expressed by Dr Giustozzi,  that
    the Appellant's former position in the ANA was  also  relevant  to  the
    risk assessment moving forward.  Nothing in the extant country guidance
    decision of AS (Safety of Kabul) Afghanistan CG [2020] UKUT 00130 (IAC)
    contradicted Dr Giustozzi's assessment on that matter, at least insofar
    as the potential risk to the Appellant in his home  province  of  Logar
    was concerned.   Whilst it might be argued that the Tribunal's  finding
    on credibility were dispositive of the question of risk - it being some
    years since the Appellant left the army,  this  was  not  the  position
    adopted by Mr Diwnycz,  who  recognised  that  any  assessment  of  the
    current risk had to be based on the current position in Logar. It might
    be, for instance, that no specific  action  was  launched  against  the
    Appellant in the years between his discharge  and  his  departure  from
    Afghanistan because  the  Taliban  did  not  have  sufficient  numbers,
    resources or political strength in his home area during that period: it
    was however incumbent upon the Tribunal to consider whether a risk  was
    made out at the date  of  the  appeal,  arising  from  the  Appellant's
    historical association with Afghan forces.

14. Is that omission  material?   As  the  parties  agreed,  in  the  final
    analysis it is question (iii)  above  that  is  determinative  in  this
    appeal. If the Tribunal's conclusions on internal flight to  Kabul  are
    free of error of law, then its decision must stand and the  Appellant's
    appeal be dismissed, regardless of any errors that might be  identified
    in respect of the initial risk assessment.

15. Here Mr Hussain relied  on  the  specific  evidence  produced  from  Dr
    Giustozzi about how living conditions in Kabul have deteriorated  as  a
    result of the pandemic. AS (Kabul) was heard in January 2020,  and  for
    reasons relating to the history of that appeal, much  of  the  evidence
    before the Tribunal dated from 2018 and earlier.  The  decision  itself
    was promulgated in May 2020. By the time that the appeal in the instant
    matter came before the First-tier Tribunal in November  of  last  year,
    the impact of Covid-19 on the Afghan economy, says  Dr  Giustozzi,  was
    tangible:

         "Since the AS ruling the situation in Kabul and in Afghanistan  has
         changed greatly, due to the onset of Covid 19. While in the  ruling
         it was assumed that an individual could always hope to be  able  to
         find employment as a day labourer, even obtaining employment  as  a
         day labourer is difficult in the current  economic  predicament  in
         Afghanistan.....

         Before the onset of the Covid-19 crisis, a day labourer could  hope
         to be hired two days out of three, although this is an average  and
         the actual rate of employment would  fluctuate.   That  implies  an
         average monthly earning (excluding periods of illness) of Afs 8,800
         ($113).

         At present, because of this crisis, a day labourer cannot  hope  to
         get hired more often than one/two days  out  of  four  (at  reduced
         rates). That implies a monthly earning of Afs 3,150 ($40).

         It is impossible to survive in Kabul with $40  per  month,  so  day
         labourers  commonly  take  loans  from  relatives,  sell   whatever
         valuables they might have, and cut their consumption to the  lowest
         possible level, such as feeding on tea and bread"

16. The Tribunal addresses this evidence at its �52-53 and concludes:

         "Whilst I accept that it is likely that the pandemic is  likely  to
         have a detrimental impact on opportunities for employment, I do not
         find Dr  Giustozzi's  opinion  to  amount  to  sufficiently  cogent
         evidence such that I should decline to follow AS. That  is  because
         the  evidence  shows  that  whilst  there  might  have  been   some
         deterioration in the economy, it does not go so far as to show that
         such deterioration is so great that the guidance in AS  should  not
         be followed...

    I interpolate to say that I accept  that  this  reasoning  is  arguably
    circular. It can be read to say that  the  Tribunal  did  not  find  Dr
    Giustozzi's evidence persuasive because his evidence is not persuasive.
    Any doubts about the sufficiency of the  reasoning  are  however  swept
    away by the final sentence in paragraph 53:

         ... Further and in any event, to the extent that there has  been  a
         degree of deterioration in the economic  situation  in  Kabul,  the
         consequences for this appellant would be mitigated by the fact that
         he is able to call on the support of his family".

17. This conclusion was based on the Tribunal's finding that the  Appellant
    remained in contact with  his  natal  family  and  that  they  had  the
    wherewithal to raise the funds required to send him to Europe.  I  find
    it difficult to detect any error  in  the  Tribunal's  reasoning  here.
    Logar  is  immediately  adjacent  to  Kabul.   Travel   is   relatively
    straightforward and it would not, at least at the date that the  appeal
    was heard in the First-tier, be difficult for the Appellant's family to
    send him food or supplies if he chose to  settle  in  the  capital.  It
    follows that Dr Giustozzi's helpful, and no  doubt  accurate,  evidence
    about the impact of Covid-19 on the job market  in  Kabul  was  not  of
    particular assistance to this Appellant.   That  being  the  case,  the
    First-tier Tribunal's findings on internal  flight  are  uninfected  by
    error of law and must stand.   The appeal is therefore dismissed.

18. There has been some delay between the appeal being heard before me, and
    this decision being made and promulgated. That is  nobody's  fault  but
    mine, and I take this opportunity to apologise to the parties  for  it.
    It is however appropriate to note that in  that  hiatus  of  some  five
    weeks the situation in Afghanistan is reported, by the BBC and  others,
    to have dramatically deteriorated. The  withdrawal  of  US  and  allied
    forces has resulted in  an  immediate  resurgence  of  the  Taliban  in
    virtually every area of the country excepting Kabul. Although  it  does
    not yet appear that the Taliban pose a military threat to the  capital,
    there is likely to be a knock-on effect on conditions in  the  city  as
    civilians flee fighting elsewhere.  The Respondent will,  in  light  of
    our  international  obligations,  no  doubt  therefore   give   careful
    consideration to events on the ground in Afghanistan  before  effecting
    any removal of the Appellant.




    Anonymity Order

19. The Appellant continues to seek international protection.   Having  had
    regard to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008
    and the Presidential Guidance Note No 1 of  2013:  Anonymity  Orders  I
    therefore consider it appropriate to make an  order  in  the  following
    terms:

        "Unless and until  a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
        Appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
        shall directly or indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his
        family.  This  direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  both  the
        Appellant  and  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with   this
        direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"



    Decisions

20. The appeal is dismissed.

21. There is no order for anonymity.
