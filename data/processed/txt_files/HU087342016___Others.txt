Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr J Metzer, Counsel, instructed by Raj Law
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr P Duffy, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is a challenge by the Appellants to  the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Rowlands (the judge), promulgated on 9 October 2017,  by
    which he dismissed their appeals against the Respondent's  decision  of
    29 March 2016, refusing their respective human rights claims made on 24
    September 2015.  In essence, the claims were based upon the  fact  that
    the third Appellant, having been born in  this  country  in  2009,  had
    spent a considerable amount of time in  the  United  Kingdom  (although
    that period had not reached the seven year threshold as at the date the
    claims were made).

The judge's decision

 2. The judge was unimpressed by certain aspects of the  first  and  second
    Appellants'  evidence.   In  particular,  he  did  not   accept   their
    explanation as to why they had not sought to regularise their status in
    this country sooner than they did.  He found that they  had  chosen  to
    stay in this country unlawfully for their own benefit and "to make  use
    of everything that the United Kingdom had to offer including having all
    the maternity care and delivery of the third Appellant without making a
    penny contribution."  The judge also found that  they  had  nothing  to
    fear on return to Mauritius (it had at some point been  indicated  that
    there might be problems from one family or another).  The circumstances
    of the third Appellant are dealt with in  [20]  and  [21].   The  judge
    finds that the third Appellant's "place" was clearly with his  parents,
    wherever that may be.  The judge accepted that the third Appellant  had
    been doing well at school and had a number of friends here.  He  states
    there was no evidence to suggest that  the  child's  welfare  would  be
    compromised by having to leave this country.  The judge states that  it
    would be "absolutely reasonable" to expect the  child  to  go  back  to
    Mauritius.

 3. Perhaps somewhat conspicuous by their absences are  any  references  to
    the phrase  "best  interests",  section  117B(6)  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, or the leading case of  MA  (Pakistan)
    [2016] EWCA Civ 705.

The grounds of appeal and grant of permission

 4. It has to be said that the grounds of appeal are lengthy, rather poorly
    drafted,  and  frankly  did  the  Appellants'  prospects  of  obtaining
    permission no favours at all.  However, by a  decision  dated  4  April
    2018 First-tier Tribunal Judge Pickup considered that it was just about
    arguable that the judge had failed to show that he had  approached  the
    relevant legal principles correctly, in particular as regards the third
    Appellant.

The hearing before me

 5. Mr Metzer had helpfully provided a  skeleton  argument  and  bundle  of
    relevant materials in advance of  the  hearing.   He  made  four  basic
    points.  First, the judge was wrong to  have  seemingly  connected  the
    issue of best interests to that of lawful status  in  a  country  (with
    reference to [21] of the judge's  decision).   Second,  the  judge  had
    failed to conduct  a  proper  best  interests  assessment  prior  to  a
    consideration of the wider public interest factors in the case.  Third,
    the judge had failed to have any reference to MA (Pakistan)  and,  more
    importantly, had failed even to make reference to the  significance  of
    the seven year threshold and section 117B(6).  There was no  indication
    that the judge had had any regard  to  the  fact  that  the  period  of
    residence of over seven years as at the date of hearing  represented  a
    strong starting point for the third Appellant.  Fourth, in  respect  of
    materiality, Mr Metzer submitted that if a proper consideration of  all
    relevant matters had been undertaken, there was  a  realistic  prospect
    that the outcome may well have been different.

 6. Mr Duffy, in his customary fair and realistic manner, accepted that the
    judge's decision was poor in certain respects.  There  was  a  lack  of
    structure and it was difficult to see that the judge had asked  himself
    the right questions in the  right  order.   It  seemed  as  though  any
    consideration of the third Appellant's best  interests  had  begun  and
    ended with the conclusion that he should stay with his family, with the
    judge then immediately going on to consider wider considerations before
    or instead of also assessing whether the  best  interests  lay  in  the
    child remaining in the United Kingdom.

Decision on error of law

 7. As I announced to the representatives at the hearing, I  conclude  that
    there are material errors of law in the judge's decision.  In light  of
    my discretion under  section  12(2)(a)  of  the  Tribunal,  Courts  and
    Enforcement Act 2007, I set the decision aside.  My  reasons  for  this
    are as follows.

 8. With due respect to the judge, there is a  lack  of  structure  in  his
    decision.  There is no specific reference to "best interests", nor  are
    there references to the primary statutory  provision  relevant  to  the
    appeal, namely section 117B(6).  There is no reference to MA (Pakistan)
    either.  Having said that, substance is almost  always  more  important
    than form and I do recognise that at [16] the judge does make reference
    to the question of whether or not it would be reasonable to expect  the
    third Appellant to return to Mauritius.

 9. The real problem does, in my view, indeed lie in the substance  of  the
    approach undertaken by the judge, particularly in relation to [20]  and
    [21].  Best interests assessments of children must be carried out in  a
    clear and adequately-reasoned manner.  The first error in  the  judge's
    approach is that whilst he was entitled to find that the best interests
    lay in the third Appellant being together with  his  parents,  he  also
    needed to address the question of whether the best interests  also  lay
    in him remaining in this country as a result of his birth here,  length
    of residence, and all other relevant circumstances.   With  regards  to
    [20], only the first limb of this assessment has been looked at.  On my
    reading of this passage the judge  has  then  immediately  gone  on  to
    conclude that it would be reasonable for the third Appellant  to  leave
    the  United  Kingdom.   The  question  of  reasonableness,  whilst   an
    important element of the decision-making process  as  a  whole,  should
    have been left until after a full best interests' assessment  had  been
    carried out.

10. The second error, connected to the first, lies in [21].  With reference
    to the now rather out  of  date  decision  in  LD  (Article  8  -  best
    interests of child) Zimbabwe [2010] UKUT 278 (IAC) (I  note  that  more
    relevant and appropriate case law  was  in  fact  referred  to  in  the
    Appellants' skeleton argument before him) the judge  seems  to  connect
    the best interests assessment  to  the  fact  of  lawful  status  in  a
    country.  This is wrong.  The best interests' assessment  needs  to  be
    conducted without reference  to  the  child's  status,  or  indeed  the
    immigration history  of  the  parents.   This  is  a  second  error  in
    approach.

11. The third error is the judge's failure to have any regard to  the  very
    significant factor of the third  Appellant's  seven  and  a  half  year
    residence in the United Kingdom as at the date of hearing.  It is quite
    clear from MA  (Pakistan)  that  once  this  threshold  is  crossed  it
    represents a matter of  "significant  weight"  in  favour  of  a  child
    remaining in the United Kingdom.  As we have been recently reminded  by
    the President in MT and ET (child's best interests; ex  tempore  pilot)
    Nigeria [2018] UKUT 00088 (IAC), "powerful reasons" need to be shown in
    order to counterweigh  the  lengthy  residence  of  children  in  these
    circumstances.  In my view the failure of the  judge  to  address  this
    factor constitutes a significant error in approach.

12. I have of course carefully considered the issue of materiality.  It  is
    right that the judge makes adverse findings in respect of the first and
    second Appellants' immigration history.  It is right, as  a  matter  of
    fact, that none of the family unit have lawful status in this  country.
    It is also the case  that  the  third  Appellant's  parents  are  well-
    educated and there was no expert evidence to suggest that  his  welfare
    would be severely impaired if he were  to  leave  the  United  Kingdom.
    Notwithstanding these factors,  I  conclude  that  the  errors  I  have
    identified above are material.  It cannot properly be said that if  the
    judge had approached the core issues before him correctly, the  outcome
    of the appeal would inevitably have been the same.

Disposal

13. Both representatives were agreed that I could and  should  re-make  the
    decision on the evidence before me.

14. Mr Metzer indicated that he wished, with permission, to call the  first
    Appellant and adduce very limited oral  evidence  on  a  single  issue,
    namely the third Appellant's linguistic abilities.   Mr  Duffy  had  no
    objection to this.  I gave  permission,  noting  that  it  was  a  very
    limited issue and that this is just the sort of situation  in  which  a
    pragmatic approach should be adopted in order to  facilitate  efficient
    re-making of decisions, rather than, for example remitting a case  back
    to the First-tier Tribunal.

15. The first Appellant confirmed that she still  wished  to  rely  on  the
    witness statement that was before the  First-tier  Tribunal.   She  was
    referred to paragraph 9 of that statement and told me  that  the  third
    Appellant only speaks English:  he  did  not  speak  either  Creole  or
    French.  Mr  Duffy  then  asked  a  number  of  questions.   The  first
    Appellant told me that she could speak Creole and sometimes  speaks  it
    with the second Appellant, although never in front of their  son.   She
    told me that they had always spoken to the third Appellant in  English,
    even when he was a small baby.  The third Appellant had also of  course
    been brought up with English when going to playgroups and at nursery.

16. Mr Metzer then made submissions on the re-making decision.   He  relied
    on his new skeleton argument.  He pointed out that as of now the  third
    Appellant has been in this country for nine years and three months.  He
    was born here, is fully integrated and now reaching the end of  Year  4
    at primary school.  I was referred to supporting evidence at B1-D2  and
    F6-F14 of the Appellants' bundle.   Mr  Metzer  noted  that  the  third
    Appellant had never been to Mauritius.  He did not  speak  any  of  the
    main  languages  there.   In  respect  of  section  117B(6)   and   the
    reasonableness assessment, there were no powerful  reasons  to  suggest
    that the third Appellant should leave the United Kingdom.  The parents'
    immigration history was poor, but  there  were  no  really  aggravating
    circumstances.  I was referred to pages 74 and 76 of  the  Respondent's
    guidance on Appendix FM: Family  life  10-year  route,  dated  February
    2018.

17. Mr Duffy submitted that the new evidence as to  the  third  Appellant's
    linguistic abilities was either untrue (as an embellishment) or was  an
    indication that the parents had contrived to make their claim  stronger
    by deliberately not teaching their  son  to  speak  Creole.   Mr  Duffy
    submitted that the child was young enough to learn a  new  language  in
    any event.  Notwithstanding the third Appellant's age  and  educational
    ties, the best interests still remained in being with his parents.  The
    first and second Appellants were longstanding overstayers and  none  of
    the family members had status in this country.  In light of [18] of the
    judge's decision there was an adverse immigration history, and  it  may
    be that a false  document  had  been  used  in  the  past.   The  third
    Appellant was not at a crucial state of his education.

18. In reply Mr Metzer submitted that the child's  best  interests  lay  in
    remaining with his parents and in the United Kingdom.  He  pointed  out
    that the judge had not made a specific finding that deception had  ever
    been used by the first or second Appellants.  No suitability issues had
    been raised by the Respondent in the reasons for refusal  letter.   The
    parents had not taught their son to speak Creole  because  they  wanted
    him to do as well as possible in the United Kingdom, and this  included
    being fully integrated at a linguistic level.  They may have been na�ve
    in this but they were not cynical.

19. At the end of the hearing I reserved my decision.

My re-make decision

Findings of primary fact

20. Most of the relevant factual circumstances in this appeal  are  not  in
    dispute.  I find that the first  and  second  Appellants  came  to  the
    United Kingdom in 2007 and both became  overstayers  later  that  year.
    They have not had lawful status here since.  I find  that  neither  the
    first or second Appellants have any criminal convictions against  their
    names.  I find that the third Appellant was born  in  this  country  in
    2009.  He has never been to Mauritius.  I find that he is  nearing  the
    end of Year 4 of his primary school  education.   I  find  that  he  is
    healthy and has no educational or developmental  difficulties.   It  is
    abundantly clear from the evidence from the school and other supporting
    documents, together with the simple fact  that  he  was  born  in  this
    country and has now resided here for over nine years, that  this  child
    is very well-integrated into British life.  Rightly or wrongly, he  has
    been brought up to think that he is, in essence, British.

21. In respect of the language issue, I do not accept Mr Duffy's submission
    that the first Appellant has lied to me at the hearing.   I  find  that
    the third Appellant does in fact only speak English, as  claimed.   The
    evidence that he has been brought up in this medium in order that he be
    fully integrated into British life is, I find,  credible.   It  may  be
    somewhat na�ve on the part of the parents to think  that  their  future
    was almost certain to lie in this country rather than in Mauritius, but
    in all the circumstances I find that they  have  acted  in  good  faith
    throughout.

22. I find that the first and second Appellants are themselves fairly well-
    educated and there is nothing to indicate that they would be unable  to
    re-establish themselves in Mauritius.  It is  more  probable  than  not
    that they would have some  form  of  familial  support  in  their  home
    country.

23. As regards [18] of the judge's  decision,  I  find  that  there  is  no
    express conclusion from the judge that either  of  them  in  fact  used
    deception.  I find that there has been no dishonesty on the  particular
    of the parents. Having said that, I find, as  did  the  judge,  that  a
    degree of blame is attributable to them in respect  of  the  manner  of
    their prolonged overstaying.

Conclusions: best interests

24. In light of my findings and all of the evidence before me  I  make  the
    following  best  interests'  assessment  in  relation  to   the   third
    Appellant.  It is clear that these interests lie in remaining with  his
    loving parents.  However, I also find that they lie in remaining in the
    United Kingdom.  The third Appellant was born in this country  and  has
    only ever known it as his home.  He is now over 9 years old and that is
    a really significant period of time.  It is quite  clearly  way  beyond
    the initial "early years" referred to in some of  the  case  law.   The
    third Appellant is obviously very well-settled in  this  country,  both
    educationally and socially.

Conclusions: the Article 8-related Rules

25. I turn to the relevant Article 8-related Rules.  It  is  common  ground
    that the Appellants cannot rely on Appendix FM in any way.   That  must
    be the case.

26. In respect of paragraph 276ADE, it  is  quite  clear  that  taking  the
    circumstances of the first and  second  Appellants  in  isolation  from
    those of the third, there are no "very significant  obstacles"  to  re-
    integrating into Mauritian society.  In respect of paragraph 276ADE(iv)
    the third Appellant cannot meet this provision because, as at the  date
    of the claim in September 2015, he had only been in  this  country  for
    approximately six and a half years.

Conclusions: section 117B(6) of the NIAA 2002

27. I turn then to section 117B(6).  There is no question  that  the  first
    and  second  Appellants  have  a  genuine   and   subsisting   parental
    relationship with the third Appellant.  He has now been in  the  United
    Kingdom for some nine years and three months.   The  core  question  is
    therefore whether it would be reasonable to expect the third  Appellant
    to leave the United Kingdom.

28. I conclude, first of all, that he would be expected to leave.  This  is
    because his parents  would  be  removed  and  there  is  no  suggestion
    whatsoever that he could possibly remain in this country alone.

29. I then direct myself  to  MA  (Pakistan)  with  reference  also  to  AM
    (Pakistan) [2017] EWCA Civ 180.  I also bear in mind what the President
    said in MT & ET.

30. On the Appellant's side of the scales I take the following matters into
    account.  The third Appellant's best interests lie  in  remaining  with
    his parents and in remaining in the United Kingdom.  Without wishing to
    repeat what I have said in paragraph 24, above, I emphasise the fact of
    his strong integration into British life, which  has  arisen  from  the
    fact that he was born here and has lived  here  for  over  nine  years.
    There  is  clearly  educational,  social,   cultural   and   linguistic
    integration.  The fact that his residence has now gone beyond the seven
    year threshold by over two years is also of importance.

31. There are then the factors resting in  the  Respondent's  side  of  the
    scales, namely the wider public  interest  considerations.   First  and
    foremost among these is the  general  public  interest  in  maintaining
    effective immigration control, with reference to section 117B(1):  that
    is of itself a significant matter.  It is strengthened by the fact that
    the first and second Appellants are long term  overstayers.  They  have
    had virtually no lawful residence in this country.  The third Appellant
    has had no lawful residence here whatsoever.  I place weight  on  these
    last two factors in addition to the general public interest issue.

32. The Appellants all speak perfectly good  English.  This  is  a  neutral
    factor.

33. The family unit cannot be financially independent because  the  parents
    are not working, although  there  is  no  question  of  them  receiving
    benefits or having engaged in unlawful employment. This  factor  counts
    against them.

34. I have had regard to the Respondent's guidance on Appendix FM  and  the
    reasonableness test, bearing in mind as I do the fact that that test is
    the same whether one is considering the Rules or section 117B(6).  With
    reference to page 74, I of course bear in mind the fact that all of the
    Appellants are Mauritian nationals and there will probably be some form
    of familial support on return to that  country.   There  are  no  wider
    familial ties in this country.  The first and second Appellants clearly
    speak the main languages of Mauritius.  There are no particular dangers
    relating to Mauritius.  I then also bear in mind what is  said  in  the
    guidance about the existence of "strong reasons" which  may  justify  a
    child leaving the United Kingdom.   The  guidance  suggests  that  such
    "strong reasons"  may  arise  where,  for  example,  the  parents  have
    "deliberately sought to circumvent immigration  control  or  abuse  the
    immigration process - for example by entering or remaining  in  the  UK
    illegally or by using deception in an application for leave to enter or
    remain".  In the present case the parents have remained in  the  United
    Kingdom illegally over a prolonged period  of  time,  although  I  have
    found that no deception has been practised by them at any stage.  There
    are no criminal matters recorded against the parents.

35. Weighing up all the relevant matters both for and against,  I  conclude
    that whilst there are certainly reasons, indeed what may  be  described
    as perfectly decent reasons, to justify requiring the  third  Appellant
    to leave the United Kingdom, these are not, on the facts of this  case,
    sufficiently "strong" or "powerful" to  outweigh  his  particular  best
    interests.  I do not consider that unlawful stay in the United  Kingdom
    acts, in and of itself, as a "strong reason" sufficient to outweigh the
    third Appellant's best interests. On a  general  note,  in  my  view  a
    degree of caution must be exercised in order to  avoid  overstaying  by
    parents becoming a "trump  card"  against  children's  best  interests.
    There are no such cards in play on either  side  of  the  scales.  With
    specific reference to the third Appellant's circumstances,  it  is  the
    length  of  residence  since  birth  (over  and  above  the  seven-year
    threshold) in combination with the degree of integration  into  British
    life which provides the very weighty ballast to his claim.

36. In consequence of the above, I conclude that it would not be reasonable
    to expect the third Appellant to leave the United Kingdom. This has the
    direct effect that the first and second  Appellants  succeed  in  their
    appeals, as they are the primary "beneficiaries"  of  section  117B(6).
    However, it follows that the third Appellant must also succeed.

37. My conclusion in these appeals has been  reached  by  a  fairly  narrow
    margin, I have to say.  This is a case in which there is not very  much
    that can be said in favour  of  the  parents,  but  there  is  a  child
    involved who has lived here all of their nine-year life and  really  is
    very well-integrated into British society.  The wider  public  interest
    considerations are significant, but just  not  significant  enough.   A
    different judge may have reached a different conclusion:  such  is  the
    nature of the Article 8 landscape.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains material errors of law  and
I set it aside.

I re-make the decision by allowing the  Appellants'  appeals  on  the  basis
that the Respondent's refusals of their  human  rights  claims  is  unlawful
under section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998.

TO THE RESPONDENT

FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a fee award and have decided to  make  reduced  fee
awards of �100.00 in each appeal, making a total of �300.00.  The  reduction
is on account of the fact the third Appellant was not a  "qualifying  child"
under section 117B(6)  as  at  the  date  of  the  claims  being  made.  The
Appellants have succeeded on appeal in essence because  of  the  passage  of
time and consequent strengthening of the child's best interests.
