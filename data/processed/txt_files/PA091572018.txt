                            DECISION AND REASONS

Direction Regarding Anonymity  -  Unless  and  until  a  tribunal  or  court
directs otherwise, the appellant is granted anonymity. No  report  of  these
proceedings shall directly or indirectly identify  them  or  any  member  of
their family. This direction applies  both  to  the  appellant  and  to  the
respondent. Failure to comply with this direction could lead to contempt  of
court proceedings.


   1. The appellant is a national of Sri Lanka, born on  10  December  1965.
      She  appeals  with  permission  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge I A Ross, who in a decision promulgated on  23  October
      2018, dismissed her asylum, humanitarian protection and  human  rights
      appeals.


      The background to the appeal


   2. The appellant claimed that her husband was a village official who  was
      forced to work for the LTTE from 1992-1995. Her case was that  he  was
      given the responsibility of looking after finances in the LTTE and had
      to write down accounts and submit them. Notwithstanding  his  official
      position, he never reported to the government that he was being forced
      to work for the LTTE as he was being monitored by the LTTE [5].


   3. The appellant  claimed  that  someone  in  the  village  reported  her
      husband's LTTE involvement to the army. She claimed that  her  husband
      was arrested and detained on three occasions by the LTTE  authorities,
      first in December 2013, then in March 2014  and  finally  in  February
      2015.


   4. On the  first  occasion,  he  was  warned  and  was  asked  about  his
      involvement with the LTTE.  On  the  second  occasion,  the  army  had
      gathered information  about  him.  He  was  however  released  without
      charge. On the third occasion, the appellant was not in Sri Lanka. Her
      husband had travelled to the UK in 2014.


   5. The appellant visited her husband in a hospital in  Colombo  when  she
      returned there. However, he died on 10 March 2015.  She  claimed  that
      this was as a result of being tortured during his third detention [6].




   6. She claimed that on 20 December 2016 and  in  February  2017  she  was
      detained and questioned by the army about  her  husband's  activities.
      She told the army that she had no knowledge  or  involvement  and  was
      released. On 27 April 2017 she was arrested  and  detained  for  three
      days. She claimed that she was questioned  about  her  husband's  LTTE
      membership again and was  tortured.  She  was  hit  on  the  head  and
      collapsed. When she woke up she was released  and  told  not  to  tell
      anyone about the arrest and detention. She was not to leave the  area.
      She was not charged with any offence as a result  of  any  arrest  and
      detention [7].


   7. She left Sri Lanka on 12 December 2017 with an  agent  using  her  own
      passport. She travelled to an unknown European country via an  unknown
      Arab country [8].


   8. The respondent accepted her identity  and  nationality.  However,  her
      account of the events in Sri Lanka was not accepted. It was  also  not
      accepted that she would be  at  risk  on  return  to  Sri  Lanka.  The
      respondent concluded that she would not fall  into  any  of  the  risk
      categories set out in the country guidance decision in GJ  and  others
      (Post Civil War: Returnees) Sri Lanka CG [2013] UKUT 319 (IAC) [10].


   9. First-tier Tribunal Judge  Ross  stated  at  [23]  that  there  is  no
      evidential  requirement  for  a  person  claiming  asylum  to  provide
      corroborative  evidence  and  that  a  lower  standard  of  proof   is
      applicable [23].


  10. He heard oral evidence from the appellant, her daughter and son in law
      in accordance with their witness statements.  The  appellant  accepted
      that she had previously travelled to the UK in 2008 and in 2013  as  a
      visitor and had returned to Sri Lanka on both  occasions.  When  asked
      why she had come to the UK, she replied that  she  was  frightened  to
      stay on her own and wanted to live with  her  daughter  for  a  little
      while to build up the courage to stay on her own - [14].


  11. She was referred to her screening interview conducted  on  20  January
      2018 where she was asked to explain all the reasons why she could  not
      return to Sri Lanka. The Judge noted at [15] that  she  stated  during
      the screening interview that she was being searched for in  Sri  Lanka
      and when she was kept by them she was beaten on her head. They  wanted
      to know some details of her husband when he was helping the  LTTE,  so
      she is in fear of being approached by them, the army.


  12. She further stated in her screening interview that on 20 December 2016
      she was not taken but  then  they  came  home  and  asked  her  a  few
      questions. On another occasion in February 2017, they  came  home  and
      asked her the same questions again. In April 2017  she  was  taken  by
      them for inquiries and kept for three days and beaten up. She was  not
      bailed but her husband and herself were beaten and as a result of  the
      beatings, her husband was admitted to hospital and died - [15].


  13. When asked why she claimed that she and her  husband  were  beaten  in
      April 2017 she claimed that this had been recorded wrongly.  She  also
      confirmed that she had only been arrested and detained on one occasion
      in April 2017 and had been released after three days. Her  father  and
      siblings are still in Sri Lanka. She has one sister and three brothers
      in Sri Lanka - [16].


  14. In re-examination she stated that she would help her husband with  his
      work by writing accounts. She had not applied for another UK  visa  as
      she had done so twice before. Her brother told her that if she applied
      for a visa she would be arrested and therefore arranged for  an  agent
      to take her out of Sri Lanka [17].


  15. She stated that she is alone in Sri Lanka now  that  her  husband  has
      died. She did not get any help from her children who are in the UK and
      Switzerland. She was in  depression.  She  cannot  sleep  and  has  no
      appetite. She now lives with her daughter in the UK and  her  daughter
      helps her. [18]


  16. The evidence of her daughter was that on 17 December 2017 she received
      a call from her mother who had arrived at Victoria Train Station.  The
      appellant then came by taxi to her house. Since  then  she  has  lived
      with her and she provides for her mother. She travelled herself to Sri
      Lanka in 2015 when her father died and was there  in  2016  [19].  The
      appellant's son in law stated that the appellant arrived in  2017  and
      said that she came with an "agency". She arrived by taxi.  He  is  not
      aware where she travelled from, having only received a telephone  call
      that she was on her way [20].


  17. First-tier Tribunal Judge  Ross  found  that  there  were  significant
      credibility issues regarding the asylum claim. He had been provided at
      the hearing with a refusal decision dated 18 June 2015 in relation  to
      a visit visa application made by the appellant. That  application  was
      made after the appellant's husband died in  March  2015.  It  recorded
      that she stated that she wished to visit her daughter, son in law  and
      grandchildren in the UK and wanted a visa for six months.  She  stated
      in the application that her husband had passed away in March 2015  and
      that her father and daughter suggested that she stay with her daughter
      in the UK [24].


  18. In that visa application in 2015, she declared that she had a  monthly
      income from family  support  in  the  amount  of  �130  and  that  her
      expenditure was �75, leaving her  with  a  balance  of  �55  a  month.
      However, her bank account had a  closing  balance  of  �5,327.85  with
      �4,880.43  having  been  deposited  on  26  May  2015.  There  was  no
      explanation as  to  the  origin  of  that  large  deposit.  That  visa
      application was refused and the decision was not appealed against.


  19. Judge Ross noted that the visit visa application made  in  2015  after
      her husband died was not mentioned by the appellant during her  asylum
      interview. Its existence was only made apparent as  a  result  of  its
      production by the Home Office Presenting Officer at the hearing: It is
      accepted that the Judge erred in  respect  of  that  finding.  He  had
      failed to check the asylum screening interview at paragraph 3.2  where
      she had stated that she applied for a visa in 2015 after  her  husband
      passed away, but the visa was refused.


  20. Judge Ross also noted that the death certificate produced stated  that
      the appellant's husband died of liver disease and did not mention  any
      physical assault or  trauma.  He  was  satisfied  that  following  her
      husband's death, the appellant 'desperately and understandably' wanted
      to live with her daughter and family in the UK. He noted however  that
      he was not deciding an appeal relating to entry clearance  application
      under the Immigration Rules but was concerned with an  appeal  against
      the refusal of her asylum claim [27].


  21. She made her asylum claim three weeks after she alleged  she  came  to
      the UK on 17 December 2017. He found that there was no record  of  her
      entry into the UK at the date she claimed to have entered. He did  not
      believe that she was not aware of the countries  which  she  travelled
      through to get to the UK, given that she  was  a  frequent  traveller,
      having previously visited the UK on  two  occasions  and  Switzerland,
      where her daughter lives. She also has relatives  in  France.  It  was
      "just not credible" as claimed by her daughter and son  in  law,  that
      she arrived unexpectedly by taxi on 17 December  2017.  There  was  an
      absence of documentary evidence to support that fact.  There  were  no
      telephone records showing that her son in law received a  call  on  17
      December 2017, nor a taxi receipt.  The  evidence  was  that  she  had
      arrived at Victoria Train Station, presumably from  Gatwick.  However,
      no train ticket was produced [28].


  22. He found that her daughter and son in law must have  been  aware  that
      she was coming to the UK. It is likely  that  they  were  involved  in
      encouraging her to come  here  illegally  after  her  visit  visa  was
      refused in 2015.  The  appellant  herself  had  stated  in  that  visa
      application that it was her father and daughter who suggested that she
      come to live with her daughter in the UK [29]


  23. He further found that the  appellant  gave  a  vague  account  of  her
      husband's activities in helping the LTTE. She claimed to have assisted
      her husband in his work for the LTTE and yet the only detail  she  has
      given is that she would help her husband  with  his  work  by  writing
      accounts. Given that her husband was a village official, it is  likely
      that he would have had to keep accounts and  that  the  appellant  may
      have helped him. The only evidence that her husband assisted the LTTE,
      however, comes from the appellant and her daughter, both  of  whom  he
      found were not credible witnesses [30].


  24. He found moreover that there is no reason for the  appellant  to  have
      been arrested and detained in April 2017 given that her  husband  died
      in March 2015 and on her own account she had already  been  questioned
      by the army twice and nothing happened to her as a  result.  He  found
      that the appellant was not arrested in  April  2017,  some  two  years
      after her husband's death - [31].


  25. He had regard to a psychiatric report prepared by Dr Hussain  who  saw
      the appellant on one occasion on 12 August 2018. His diagnosis of PTSD
      is as a result of the account given to him by the appellant  which  he
      has accepted.


  26. First-tier Tribunal Judge Ross  found  that  it  is  likely  that  the
      appellant's general anxiety is as a result  of  the  prospect  of  her
      being returned to Sri Lanka and not because of what  had  happened  to
      her there. He noted that the appellant has not required any  inpatient
      treatment. Dr Hussain had recommended a light treatment plan  of  20mg
      fluoxetine per day and cognitive behavioural therapy if needed [32].


  27. He found that the appellant failed to substantiate her  asylum  claim,
      even to the lower standard of proof - [33].


  28. With regard to her human rights claim, he noted that she is  52  years
      old and has lived in Sri Lanka all her life. Whilst accepting that her
      husband had died, there is no evidence that she requires constant care
      in relation to her physical and emotional  needs.  Nor  is  there  any
      evidence that personal care is not  available  or  affordable  in  Sri
      Lanka. For Article 8 to be engaged in this case, there  needed  to  be
      more than mere emotional dependency' in a normal relationship  between
      a parent and adult child. The appellant in this case had  not  reached
      that threshold [34].


  29. Mr Shahzad,  who  represented  the  appellant  before  the  First-tier
      Tribunal referred to his grounds seeking permission. He submitted that
      the Judge wrongly put the burden on the appellant to substantiate  her
      asylum claim. He erred in his conclusion at [24-26] that the appellant
      is not credible since she failed to mention  the  visit  visa  refusal
      application made in 2015. He  failed  to  properly  check  the  asylum
      screening interview and made an  incorrect  finding  relating  to  the
      appellant's account: She had mentioned in her screening interview that
      her application was refused in 2015.


  30. He further submitted that the Judge himself raised the  issue  of  the
      appellant's entry into the UK at the hearing. The respondent  did  not
      raise that issue in the refusal letter. In her screening interview she
      outlined her journey to the UK. There she stated  that  she  left  Sri
      Lanka on 12 December 2017 and travelled to an unknown European country
      via an unknown Arab country. It was from this  country  that  she  was
      travelling with the agent, posing as his wife, and  she  travelled  by
      vehicle as a passenger. She arrived in the UK by car as a passenger on
      17 December 2017.


  31. The respondent did not dispute her account of her journey to  the  UK.
      She does not speak or read English. She does not understand Arabic. It
      is unreasonable to expect her to know the different countries that she
      had travelled through when coming to the UK.


  32. Further, the Judge failed to consider the evidence  of  the  appellant
      and her daughter properly.


  33. The Judge did not make any findings regarding the core  issue  of  the
      appellant's asylum claim, namely, that she was afraid  that  the  army
      would kill her for assisting in her work for  the  LTTE.  She  gave  a
      detailed  account  of  her  husband's  working  with  the  LTTE.   The
      determination regarding the issue of the  appellant's  work  with  the
      LTTE is vague.


  34. He referred to  her  witness  statement  where  she  stated  that  she
      supported her husband in preparing the accounts of funds of the  LTTE.
      She did not join the LTTE formally. She supported the  LTTE  secretly,
      just like her husband. The Judge did not engage  with  her  claim  for
      fear of persecution due to her working  with  the  LTTE.  He  did  not
      consider her evidence "in depth."


  35. The Judge did not make any findings regarding her  account  of  arrest
      and detention by the authorities on three  occasions.  However,  as  I
      have already noted, the Judge did make findings: He found  that  there
      was no reason for her to have been  arrested  and  detained  in  April
      2017, given that her husband died in March 2015. Further, on  her  own
      account she had already been questioned by the army twice and  nothing
      had happened to her as a result. He found that she was not arrested in
      April 2017, some two years after her husband's death [31].


  36.  The  Judge  has  not  provided  any  reasons  to  conclude  that  the
      appellant's daughter and son in law encouraged her to  travel  to  the
      UK. Those  negative  findings  on  the  'non-issue'  resulted  in  the
      negative credibility about the appellant's core asylum claim.


  37. He submitted that the Judge also erred  in  failing  to  consider  the
      report of Dr Hussain about the risk of removal on  her  mental  health
      condition. He warned her about the risk of deterioration in her mental
      health  if  she  failed  to  comply  with  the  medical  treatment  as
      recommended.


  38. He submitted at paragraph 33 of the grounds, that  the  Judge  wrongly
      concluded at [34] that the appellant required constant care.  However,
      at [34] the Judge in  fact  stated  that  whilst  accepting  that  her
      husband has died, there is no evidence that she did  require  constant
      care in relation to her physical and emotional needs, nor is there any
      evidence that personal care is not  available  or  affordable  in  Sri
      Lanka.


  39. On behalf of the respondent, Ms Isherwood  submitted  that  there  has
      been no material error of law. The grounds amount  to  a  disagreement
      with the Judge's findings.


  40. The Judge properly identified the appellant's claim from  [5]  of  the
      determination.


  41. She accepted that the Judge erred at [26] in stating  that  the  visit
      visa application made in 2015  was  not  mentioned  by  the  appellant
      during her asylum interview. As already noted, it had  been  mentioned
      by her in the screening interview. However,  that  'mistake'  did  not
      amount to a material error of law.


  42. She referred to the death  certificate  relating  to  the  appellant's
      husband at page 143 of the bundle. The cause of  death  is  stated  as
      "Encompensent crooning liver sale decease diabetics moltas (sic)."  He
      thus died of natural causes.


  43. Although  the  respondent  did  not  dispute  the  appellant's  travel
      arrangements, she noted that the appellant claimed to have been  aware
      that she came to the UK through European countries. She submitted that
      if you are a genuine  asylum  seeker,  you  should  accordingly  avail
      yourself of the opportunity to claim asylum in those countries.


  44. With regard to the Judge's credibility finding at [28], she  submitted
      that the appellant has to do  her  best  to  support  her  claim.  The
      documentary  evidence  referred  to  by  the  Judge  would  have  been
      available.


  45. She submitted that  the  psychiatrist  relied  on  the  statement  and
      account submitted  by  the  appellant,  as  well  as  the  solicitors'
      instructions. However, the respondent's reasons for  refusal  had  not
      been made available to the psychiatrist who thus accepted the claim at
      face value. There was no assessment made. Nor is  there  any  evidence
      that the  appellant  has  received  any  treatment  suggested  in  the
      recommendations at paragraph 7, page 100. Dr Hussain found that  there
      was a risk of deterioration if she fails to comply  with  the  medical
      treatment as recommended.


  46. Ms Isherwood submitted that the appellant in any event  did  not  fall
      into any of the categories  of  persons  at  risk  of  persecution  or
      serious harm on return to Sri Lanka. The Judge  had  referred  to  the
      decision of GJ and others, supra, at [10].


  47. Finally, she referred to the decision  in  Ribeli  v  Entry  Clearance
      Officer, Pretoria [2018] EWCA Civ 611. There has to be something  more
      than normal emotional ties between the appellant and her daughter  and
      son in law. There is accordingly a high threshold which was not met in
      this case.


  48. In reply, Mr Shahzad referred to the appellant's witness statement  at
      paragraph 24.  When she went to Switzerland to see her  daughter,  she
      did not have any illness. Her husband was only  diabetic.  His  health
      was good. She was told that his liver was damaged,  resulting  in  his
      sudden death. She did not believe  them  as  she  has  seen  scars  of
      torture on his body.


  49. He submitted that following GJ, if a person is detained in  Sri  Lanka
      by the security services, there remains a real risk of  ill  treatment
      or harm requiring international protection.


      Assessment


  50. It is accepted by Ms Isherwood that the First-tier Tribunal Judge I  A
      Ross erred in stating that the appellant failed to mention the refusal
      of her visit visa application made in 2015.


  51. It is also contended that the Judge wrongly imposed a  requirement  to
      provide evidence to substantiate her asylum claim. However,  as  noted
      by First-tier Tribunal Judge Grimmett,  when  granting  permission  to
      appeal, grounds 7 and 8 failed  to  indicate  where  corroboration  or
      evidence not available to the appellant was required by the Judge.  As
      submitted by Ms Isherwood, the Judge did not accept  the  evidence  of
      the appellant's daughter and son in  law  that  the  appellant  simply
      arrived unexpectedly by taxi on  17  December  2017.  It  is  in  that
      context that he found that there was an  absence  of  any  documentary
      evidence to substantiate that fact.


  52. The Judge has given a detailed decision. He noted that  the  appellant
      claimed to have been detained and questioned by  the  army  about  her
      husband's activities in December 2016, February 2017 and  April  2017.
      He found that there was no reason  for  the  appellant  to  have  been
      arrested and detained in April 2017 given that  her  husband  died  in
      March 2015 and that she had already been questioned twice by the  army
      and that nothing happened to her as a  result.  He  accordingly  found
      that she had not been arrested in April 2017 which was two years after
      her husband's death.


  53. He found that the appellant gave a  vague  account  of  her  husband's
      activities in helping the LTTE. She would help her  husband  with  his
      work by writing accounts. However, he noted that  her  husband  was  a
      village official and it is likely that  he  would  have  had  to  keep
      accounts and that the appellant may have helped him. The only evidence
      that her husband assisted the LTTE however, came  from  the  appellant
      and her daughter, both of whom he found were not credible witnesses.


  54. It is contended that his incorrect finding that the appellant had  not
      disclosed the visa application that she made  in  2015  following  her
      husband's death, arguably coloured the Judge's findings regarding  the
      appellant's and her daughter's credibility.


  55. However, the Judge also had regard to  other  evidence  including  the
      fact that the death certificate produced stated that her husband  died
      of liver disease and did not mention any signs of physical assaults or
      trauma.


  56.  Further,  he  did  not  accept  as  credible  the  assertion  by  the
      appellant's daughter and son in law  that  the  appellant  had  simply
      arrived unexpectedly in December 2017. He found that  they  must  have
      been aware that the appellant was coming to the UK. He noted that  the
      appellant herself stated in the visa application which was refused  in
      2015 that her daughter and father suggested she come to live with  the
      daughter in the UK [29].


  57. Her husband died on 10 March 2015. However, she claimed that it was in
      December 2016 and February 2017 that she was questioned  by  the  army
      about her husband's activities. She always  stated  that  she  had  no
      knowledge or involvement. On her evidence, the authorities  had  shown
      no interest in her for more than  one  and  a  half  years  after  her
      husband's death. He accordingly found on the evidence as a whole  that
      the appellant had not been arrested and detained, as claimed, in April
      2017.


  58. First-tier Tribunal Judge Ross has  also  considered  the  psychiatric
      report from Dr Hussain. He noted that there was no evidence  that  the
      appellant required constant care  in  relation  to  her  physical  and
      emotional needs. Nor was there any evidence that personal care is  not
      available or affordable in Sri Lanka. Notwithstanding  the  submission
      at paragraph 33 of the grounds of appeal, the Judge  did  not  wrongly
      conclude that the appellant required constant care.


  59. First-tier Tribunal Judge I A Ross has given sustainable  reasons  for
      his adverse credibility findings. Having regard to  the  determination
      as a whole, I find that he has not made any material error on a  point
      of law.
