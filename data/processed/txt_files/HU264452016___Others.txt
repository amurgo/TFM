                                                                  Respondent


For the Appellant:     Mr R Gibb, of D Duheric & Co, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mrs M O'Brien, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    1. The appellants are mother and two children, born on 11 November 1973,
       [ ] 2000, and [ ] 2002.  They all reside in India,  apparently  since
       around 2003, with identity certificates permitting them to do so (and
       to travel abroad).

    2. The appellants are not citizens of Nepal, as erroneously stated at �1
       of the decision  by  FtT  Judge  Mays.   They  and  the  sponsor  all
       originate from Tibet.  Their representative  has  no  information  on
       whether all or any of the four family members are citizens of  China,
       rather than being stateless, as rather vaguely asserted.  It has also
       been said (and appears likely, but is not confirmed by documentation)
       that the three appellants are recognised as refugees in  India.   The
       sponsor came to the UK in 2003.  He was not recognised as  a  refugee
       in the UK but obtained indefinite leave to remain  (perhaps  under  a
       "legacy exercise") in 2010.  At some  later  date,  he  became  a  UK
       citizen.  It was asserted in the FtT, but not  established,  that  he
       could not go to live permanently with the appellants in India.  These
       are obvious  points  on  which  clarity  might  have  been  expected;
       however, nothing ultimately turns on any of them.

    3. The sponsor lived apart from the rest of the family until  2013.   By
       the time of the FtT hearing he had made 3  visits,  each  of  3  -  4
       months, to his family in India.  (At the time of the UT  hearing,  he
       was in India on his fourth such visit.)

    4.  The  appellants  applied  to  join  the  sponsor  in  2013.    Those
       applications were refused and  not  appealed.   Further  applications
       were made under cover of a letter from  solicitors  dated  3  October
       2016. The ECO refused those applications for reasons given in notices
       dated 3 November 2016.

    5. Judge May dismissed the appellants' appeals for reasons given in  her
       decision promulgated on 15 March 2017.

    6. The appellant's grounds of appeal are stated in the  application  for
       permission to appeal dated 7 April 2017 (which in  terms  of  the  TP
       (UT) Rules 2008, rule 23 (1A), now stands as the notice of appeal  to
       the UT):

          The appellants ... rely on ECHR article 8 outside the  rules  (the
          sponsor cannot meet the financial requirements) ...  The  issue...
          was one of proportionality. The judge found that the exclusion  of
          the appellants from the UK was proportionate ... in so doing,  she
          erred in law.

          The judge's findings on proportionality are summed up at �50 ... :

             "Family life will however be able to continue as it has in the
             past with the sponsor visiting India for a long  holiday  each
             year and through contact using modern means of communication".

          This finding is in stark contrast to that of the UT in LD (article
          8 - best interests of child) [2010] UKUT 278 where President Blake
          J opined as follows:

             "We therefore turn to consider  the  judge's  reasoning  on...
             proportionality... we find it is wholly absent... We find  his
             reference to maintain contact with his family "in  the  normal
             manner" is extraordinary.  Families  normally  live  together.
             Family life consists  of  the  inter-dependent  bonds  between
             spouses or stable partners and between  parents  and  children
             with particular strength been placed upon  the  interests  and
             welfare of minor children. It is not normal for family life to
             be enjoyed by correspondence and occasional visits..."

          ... The judge misdirected herself in law by failing to follow this
          guidance... These errors go to the core of the judge's findings on
          proportionality ... and vitiate her findings...


    7. FtT Judge  Scott-Baker  granted  permission  on  25  September  2017,
       observing:

          The judge reminded herself at �35 ... quoting  from  MM  (Lebanon)
          [2017] UKSC 10 that the immigration rules were  unlawful  in  that
          the s.55 duty relating to children had not been fully incorporated
          in the rules and that as a result the statutory duty had not  been
          properly taken into account.  Having  found  that  there  were  no
          further  findings  on   this   defect   in   the   assessment   of
          proportionality and as a result, the decision arguably discloses a
          material error of law in that the interests of the  children  have
          been inadequately assessed.

    8. In a rule 24 response to the grant of permission, the SSHD (on behalf
       of the ECO) says:

          The judge has given a careful and considered  judgement,  and  has
          come to findings open on the evidence before her.

          The grounds are merely disagreements with lawful findings, seeking
          to reargue the matter before the UT.

          LD has no application to the facts of this case, and whilst MM has
          possibly altered the evidential requirements in relation to  cases
          with children, it has not struck down the relevant threshold,  nor
          has it resulted in the situation where a failure to meet the rules
          does not weigh heavily in the proportionality balance.

    9. On 26 October 2016, the UT issued notice of the hearing on 9 November
       2017.   In  an  email   of   3   November   2017,   the   appellants'
       representatives sought an adjournment.  They were represented  by  Mr
       Gibb, as they had been in the FtT, but  he  had  changed  firm.   The
       reason advanced was that files had not been  received  from  previous
       representatives and that not  having  had  sight  of  the  evidential
       bundles, they would be significantly disadvantaged.

   10. Unfortunately, due to an administrative  slip,  the  application  for
       adjournment was not placed before  a  UT  Judge  in  advance  of  the
       hearing.

   11. When the case was called on at 10:00, Mr Gibb applied for adjournment
       on the foregoing grounds.  However, he was unable to show,  based  on
       the decision, the grounds, and the grant of permission (all of  which
       representatives had) that preparation (on error  of  law,  at  least)
       required further investigation of the evidence which had been  before
       the FtT.  There was no ground suggesting that the judge went wrong on
       the primary facts regarding the children.   Mr  Gibb  was  unable  to
       explain the alleged difficulty other than by way of what appeared  to
       be a proposed "fishing expedition".  However, I provided Mr Gibb with
       the bundles which were on the file, and agreed at that stage at least
       to put the case back until later in the day.

   12. At about 12:15, Mr Gibb indicated that he was ready, and that he  was
       not renewing his application to adjourn.  The hearing proceeded.

   13. (There was a second point in the grounds, which is not quoted  above.
       Mr Gibb said that it was based on a typographical error, and  was  of
       no significance, and withdrew it.)

   14. There was then some elucidation of what is known of  the  citizenship
       and other status of the parties, as summarised above at �1 - 2.

   15. The main points I noted from the oral submissions  by  Mr  Gibb  were
       these:

        i) LD was cited to the FtT.   It  is  authority  that  family  life
           cannot be constituted by visits and modern communications.

       ii) Reference to visits and modern communications did not constitute
           an assessment of the best interests of the children.

      iii) That erroneous approach was  the  core  of  the  proportionality
           assessment.

       iv) It was an error to found on family life  continuing  as  it  has
           been carried on, when the nature of that family life was not the
           fault of the children.

        v) While the sponsor had not established himself to be  a  refugee,
           it would be erroneous to take it that he came to the UK only  as
           a matter of choice or simply to seek  a  better  life.   In  any
           event, that again would not be the children's fault.

       vi) Although the appellants failed to show that  the  sponsor  could
           not live with them in India (�42 - 43), it should not  be  taken
           that the parties have that choice.

      vii) There had been evidence from the  first  appellant,  in  written
           communication to her representatives, of the harmful  effect  of
           the separation on the children, and orally from the sponsor, who
           was found credible.

     viii) It was to be presumed that the children's best  interests  would
           be served by living with both parents.

       ix) The judge was wrong to find at �40 that it might be an  upheaval
           or a wrench for the children to leave India.  There had been  no
           evidence at all entitling her to make such findings.   The  only
           evidence was to the contrary, that their private and family life
           was undermined by the refusal of entry clearance.

        x) Alternatively, findings that there might be any upheaval through
           leaving India were inadequately reasoned.

       xi) The judge was wrong at the end of �40 to  contemplate  that  the
           children  might  visit  their  father  in  the  UK.   Any   such
           applications were bound to be refused.

      xii) The judge was wrong to say at the end of �41 that the welfare of
           the children "would not be compromised should they  continue  to
           live in India with the first  appellant".   There  had  been  no
           evidence by which that  might  be  justified.   Again,  all  the
           evidence was to the contrary.

     xiii) The grounds, or  the  grant,  were  wide  enough  to  cover  the
           submissions on �40-41.

      xiv) It might be factually correct to say there could be  visits  and
           communication, but to give that any weight was an error of law.

       xv) The case had been a finely balanced one.  The  judge  might  not
           have come to the same conclusion if the errors were excised. The
           decision should be set aside.

      xvi) The  appellants  have  not  yet  applied  to  introduce  further
           evidence, as required by rules and directions.   However,  their
           representatives have  been  handicapped  in  preparing  for  the
           possibility of a further  hearing.   If  the  decision  was  set
           aside, then a further hearing should be fixed, either in the FtT
           or in the UT, to give them  the  opportunity  to  make  such  an
           application.

   16. The main points I noted from the  submissions  by  Mrs  O'Brien  were
       these:

        i) The rule 24 response was  succinct  and  accurate.  This  was  a
           classic instance of mere disagreement  with  the  fact-sensitive
           assessment reached by the judge.

       ii) The single sentence excerpted in the grounds might  be  read  in
           isolation as an error along LD lines, but that was  not  a  fair
           reading of  the  entire  decision,  which  was  based  on  close
           inspection of the facts and the overall reality of the case.

      iii) "Normal" family life for this family was based  on  the  sponsor
           living separately from them from 2003 to  2013,  and  on  yearly
           visits of several months thereafter.  There was nothing to  show
           that  was  other  than  a  matter  of  choice.  Throughout   the
           separation, there was nothing to prevent the  sponsor  going  to
           live with his family in India.

       iv) The judge had not  based  the  decision  solely  on  visits  and
           communications, and had not ignored  the  difficulties  and  the
           emotional impact of separation. Those aspects were  clearly  and
           sympathetically considered:  �41,  read  more  fully,  "While  I
           accept the children miss the sponsor and  would  like  to  spend
           more time with him and that the sponsor  loves  and  misses  his
           children, I do not find that the welfare of [the children] would
           be compromised ... ", and �50, "I understand the desire to  live
           together in the UK as  a  family  unit  and  the  sadness  their
           separation causes them".

        v) The grounds made no challenge to the findings at �40 -  41,  and
           those arguments should not be entertained at this late stage.

       vi) The judge at �40 - 41 made  an  assessment  not  in  absence  of
           evidence, but firmly grounded in  obvious  facts.  The  children
           have spent their lives and have been educated in India and  must
           have roots there. There was no factual or  legal  error  in  the
           conclusion that  their  welfare  would  not  be  compromised  by
           continuing to live with their mother in India. Contrary  to  the
           submission for the appellants that the evidence pointed  in  one
           direction only, there was no evidence that they would suffer any
           serious detriment.

      vii) There was nothing to indicate that the judge found this to be  a
           finely balanced case. Rather, she seemed to have found that  the
           facts  pointed  quite  clearly  to  the  conclusion   that   the
           respondent's decisions did not disproportionately interfere with
           family life.

     viii) There was no legal error in the decision.

   17. Mr Gibb in response said:

        i) A description of the life of the  parties  to  date  as  "normal
           family life" could not mitigate any error,  because  that  could
           not make it any less disproportionate to allow  interference  to
           continue.

       ii) The judge was bound to treat visits and communications as of  no
           weight, yet those matters had been made central to the outcome.

   18. I indicated in course of submissions that I saw no merit in the point
       (whether or not it could be brought within the  grounds)  that  there
       was no evidence from which to find that departure  from  India  would
       cause any upheaval in the lives of the children.

   19. Beyond that, I reserved my decision.

   20. The principal argument for the appellants takes the dictum in LD  out
       of context; gives it a wider meaning than it bears; and misrepresents
       the decision of the FtT as a whole.

   21. Mr Gibb said that LD was cited to the FtT.  That appears to have been
       no more than a passing oral reference.  The first written citation is
       by attachment of  a  copy  to  the  grounds  of  appeal  to  the  UT.
       (References to reports have not been provided; these may be found  at
       [2011] Imm. A.R. 99 and at [2011] I.N.L.R. 347.)   Mr  Gibb  made  no
       direct reference to LD in his submissions in the UT.

   22. All article 8 cases turn ultimately on their own facts; and the facts
       of LD were very different from this case.  A Zimbabwean national  had
       family life in the UK for over 11 years; his wife and  children  were
       granted leave; it was unreasonable to expect them to depart from  the
       UK; and his application  was  refused  for  non-disclosure  of  spent
       driving convictions.  That is the context in which  the  observations
       of the UT are to be read.

   23. LD has often been cited. One example is HH v SSHD [2015] CSIH.   Lord
       Brodie, giving the judgement of the Court, said at �32-33:


          32.    The petitioner's argument that the FTT, and  therefore  the
          UT and the Lord Ordinary, made an error in law in this  particular
          respect depends on an interpretation of what was said by  Blake  J
          in giving the decision of the UT in LD v Secretary  of  State  for
          the Home Department (article 8 best interests of  child)  Zimbabwe
          [2011] Imm AR 99 at para 26. What he said was this:
             "Very weighty reasons  are  needed  to  justify  separating  a
             parent from a minor child or from the community in which he or
             she has grown up and lived for most of her life."
          33.    There is no question of separating a parent  from  a  minor
          child in the present  case.  As  for  the  proposition  that  very
          weighty reasons are needed to justify separating a child from  the
          community in which she has grown up and  lived  for  most  of  her
          life, one might quite readily agree with that if what is being put
          forward  is  a  generalisation  about  what   is   reasonable   or
          proportionate. It is a different  matter  if  the  proposition  is
          being put forward as a rule of law. We note that Blake J described
          it as a "principle" but we  doubt  whether  he  was  intending  to
          enunciate a legal rule. We would accept that a  child's  residence
          in the United Kingdom for most or all of her life  is  a  relevant
          circumstance  pointing  away  from  the  proportionality  of   her
          removal, which circumstance may gain strength from the  length  of
          the residence, degree of integration in the community,  extent  of
          participation in education and precise  immigration  status.  That
          the children and one of their parents all have indefinite leave to
          remain,  as  was  the  case  in  LD,  may  be  a   very   powerful
          circumstance. However, that is as far as it goes.  Simply  because
          the  FTT  in  this  case  did  not  articulate  its  decision   on
          proportionality in terms of "very weighty reasons" does  not  mean
          that it erred in law.

   24. That is based on a different passage of LD, but it  illustrates  that
       LD generalises about what is reasonable or proportionate, rather than
       laying down rules of law.

   25. What is to be drawn from LD, for present purposes, is that occasional
       visits and communications at a  distance  do  not  equate  to  normal
       family life, but it lays down no doctrine that in  all  cases  visits
       (of whatever duration) and communications must be left  entirely  out
       of the balance - as if it were to  be  presumed  that  unless  living
       together in the UK,  parties  are  prohibited  from  maintaining  any
       links.

   26. What the judge said was factually accurate, and did not equate visits
       and  modern  communications  with  the  family   living   permanently
       together.  The decision, as Mrs O'Brien pointed out, is clear in  the
       passages cited on the emotional impact of their separation.

   27. The basis in the grounds for  the  criticisms  raised  of  �40-41  is
       rather faint, but it is preferable to dispose of the challenge on its
       lack of merit.

   28. Far from having no basis, the judge's comments are based on plain and
       sensible reading of the evidence before her.  The children  moved  to
       India at an age when they will  have  scant  recollection  of  living
       elsewhere.  They are now aged 15 and almost 17. Their departure would
       mean leaving  the  community  in  which  they  have  grown  up,  been
       educated, and lived for most of their lives.  That is upheaval  which
       the parties are prepared to  bear,  but  it  is  absurd  to  say  the
       evidence excludes its existence.

   29. Any further applications  the  children  make  to  enter  the  UK  as
       visitors or in any other capacity will fall to be assessed  on  their
       merits; but Mr Gibb may be right  to  say  that,  as  matters  stand,
       refusal seems likely.  However, the judge was not wrong to  say  that
       visiting "may be possible"; and that was an  incidental  observation,
       not repeated in the summing up.


   30. The essence of the decision is that taking the best interests of  the
       children as a primary but not paramount consideration, the appellants
       did not show compelling circumstances, such that they have a right to
       settle in the UK, other than in  compliance  with  the  rules.   That
       conclusion was firmly based on a realistic assessment of the  overall
       facts, not on any misapprehension about the quality  of  family  life
       restricted to visits and communications.

   31. The grounds and submissions for the appellants have  not  shown  that
       the making of the decision involved the making  of  any  error  on  a
       point of law.

   32. I observe, incidentally, that on unchallenged findings by the FtT, it
       is doubtful whether the ultimate issue lay between the  family  being
       kept apart by the operation of the rules and being  reunited  in  the
       UK; rather, it turned on the proportionality of the family being  put
       to the choice of continuing as they are, or living together in India.
        The appellants had the benefit of the judge deciding on  the  former
       basis, more advantageous from their point of view,  rather  than  the
       latter.

   33. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.

   34. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
