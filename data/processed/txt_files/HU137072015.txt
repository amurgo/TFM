Representation:

For the Appellant:     In person
For the Respondent:    Mr I Jarvis, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria born in 1985.  She arrived in the
    UK on 7 February 2008 with leave to enter as a spouse.

 2. On 14 June 2013 she made an application for leave to remain on  Article
    8 grounds.  That application was refused, with no right of  appeal.   A
    judicial review was unsuccessful.

 3. She then made a further application  for  leave  to  remain  which  was
    refused in a decision dated 1 December 2015 which is the decision which
    is the subject of this appeal.   The  appellant's  appeal  came  before
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Scott-Baker ("the FtJ")  on  13  March  2017,
    following which the appeal was dismissed.

 4. In order to put the grounds of appeal and my conclusions into  context,
    it is necessary to summarise the FtJ's decision.

    The FtJ's decision

 5.  The  FtJ  summarised  the  respondent's  reasons  for   refusing   the
    application, and identified the evidence that she had before  her.  She
    set out a detailed account of the appellant's evidence, both  in  terms
    of her written statement and from  her  oral  evidence.   Likewise,  in
    relation to the evidence of her husband.  There was  also  written  and
    oral evidence from the brother of the appellant's husband.  Medical and
    other evidence was also summarised.

 6. At [48] the FtJ noted that no issue had been raised by  the  respondent
    in terms of the genuineness of the relationship between  the  appellant
    and her spouse.   She  also  noted  however,  that  the  appellant  had
    remained in the UK without leave since the expiry of her visa  in  July
    2008.

 7. The FtJ rejected the  contention  that  it  would  be  unsafe  for  the
    appellant to return to Nigeria,  reflecting  evidence  that  she  heard
    about  the  security  situation  there  and  noting  that  no   country
    background material in that respect was referred to.   She  also  noted
    that the appellant's brother-in-law had returned to  Nigeria  to  visit
    siblings just two weeks prior to the hearing.

 8. At [51] she found that the appellant and her  spouse  had  not  severed
    their ties to Nigeria and that the appellant's spouse had  returned  to
    Nigeria in the past, as had his brother.  It was also clear that  there
    were family members still living there.   She  noted  that  whilst  the
    appellant's spouse is now a British citizen and is settled in  the  UK,
    she found that the evidence did not establish that either the appellant
    or he would face "very significant difficulties" in Nigeria on  return.
    Thus,  she  concluded  that  the  appellant  could  not   satisfy   the
    requirements of Appendix FM.

 9. The  FtJ  then  went  on  to  consider  whether  there  would  be  very
    significant obstacles to the appellant's integration into Nigeria, with
    reference to paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi).  She concluded that  there  would
    not be such obstacles.

10. At [54], under a consideration of Article 8 outside of the confines  of
    the Rules, she accepted that IVF treatment in Nigeria would not  be  as
    good as that  available  in  the  UK.   She  nevertheless  referred  to
    background material relied on by the respondent to the effect that such
    treatment was available in Nigeria.

11. She concluded that although the appellant does enjoy family and private
    life in the UK, and that her removal  would  constitute  a  significant
    breach of those Article 8 rights, she nevertheless  concluded  at  [56]
    that the decision to remove her was not disproportionate in  Article  8
    terms.

12. Then, at [57], she stated that the appeal was dismissed under  Appendix
    FM of the Rules and under Article 8 of the ECHR.  In the next paragraph
    she stated that as the appeal had been dismissed she declined to make a
    fee award.

13. However, having  dismissed  the  appeal,  the  FtJ,  rather  unusually,
    included   a   further   seven   paragraphs   under   the   sub-heading
    "Submissions".  From [60] to [62] she summarised the  submissions  made
    by the parties before her.  At [63] she referred  to  the  decision  in
    Agyarko & Ikuga v Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department  [2017]
    UKSC 11, to the effect that a  very  strong  or  compelling  claim  was
    required to outweigh the public interest in immigration  control.   She
    stated that an unusual feature for the appellant in this case  was  her
    desire to continue  with  IVF  treatment  in  the  UK,  but  that  such
    treatment was available in  Nigeria.   The  appellant  was  paying  for
    treatment in the UK, and thus she found that there was not a cost issue
    if she had to pay in Nigeria.  She stated that her wish to  access  IVF
    treatment in the  UK  could  not  be  said  to  amount  to  exceptional
    circumstances.

14. The FtJ started the next paragraph with  the  phrase  "Considering  the
    issue of proportionality with regard  to  Section  117B"  referring  to
    factors under s.117B of the Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act
    2002 ("the 2002 Act").  She noted that the appellant gave her  evidence
    in English, but also referred to the need for an English language  test
    to be passed if the appellant was required to apply for leave to remain
    as a  spouse.   She  found  that  the  appellant  was  not  financially
    independent, but she was married  to  her  spouse  who  was  a  British
    taxpayer.  In the next paragraph the  FtJ  stated  that  little  weight
    should be given to the  appellant's  private  life  or  a  relationship
    formed with a qualifying partner, established at a time when the person
    is in the UK unlawfully, which is the  position  in  relation  to  this
    appellant.  She again noted that the  appellant  had  been  in  the  UK
    unlawfully since her visa expired in 2008.

15. In the very last paragraph of the decision she stated again, as she had
    at [57], that the appeal was dismissed.

    The grounds and submissions

16. In summary, the grounds contend that the FtJ failed to engage with  the
    factual basis of the appeal and failed to carry out a proper  balancing
    exercise under Article 8.  The FtJ  was  wrong,  it  is  contended,  to
    conclude that the  circumstances  in  the  appellant's  case  were  not
    exceptional.  The points relied on in the grounds are: the  superiority
    of IVF treatment in the UK as compared to Nigeria, the significant sums
    that the appellant and her spouse had spent on the  treatment  already,
    their inability to continue paying for  that  treatment  on  return  to
    Nigeria because the appellant's husband would lose his employment,  and
    the need for treatment to  be  undertaken  sooner  rather  than  later,
    because of their ages.  It  is  said  that  they  would  lose  all  the
    benefits accruing from the tests and treatment that they had  paid  for
    so far if there was an interruption of that treatment even for a  short
    period of a couple of months.

17. The grounds also contend that the FtJ erred at [30]  where  she  stated
    that the  appellant  and  her  husband  had  only  spent  �300  on  the
    treatment, whereas they had spent �3,000.  Thus, it is argued that  the
    FtJ had diminished the difficulties  that  the  couple  would  face  in
    funding their treatment, even when they are together in the UK.

18. In relation to s.117B of the 2002 Act, it is argued that the FtJ  erred
    in looking only at the circumstances which  favoured  removal,  without
    having regard to factors  which  weighed  in  favour  of  allowing  the
    appellant to remain in the UK.  The matters relied on are that there is
    adequate support and maintenance for the appellant without recourse  to
    public funds, and that the appellant's husband is in  employment.   The
    appellant is herself able and willing to  take  up  employment,  it  is
    said.  The appellant's integration in the UK  would  not  be  adversely
    affected by her remaining here, given her husband's income which leaves
    them with far more than the basic minimum  for  a  couple  with  income
    support.  Further, it is argued  in  the  grounds  that  there  are  no
    countervailing factors militating against  the  grant  of  leave.   The
    appellant entered the UK legally and only became  an  overstayer  after
    she suffered domestic abuse at the hands of her former husband.   There
    was nothing to suggest that her presence in the UK was not conducive to
    the public  good.   Allowing  her  to  remain  would  not  in  any  way
    compromise the respondent's ability to maintain  effective  immigration
    control.

  19. It is further  said  that  the  appellant  speaks  English,  would  be
      adequately maintained and has already properly integrated herself. The
      arguments in favour of the appellant are  not  inconsistent  with  the
      decision in AM (S 117B) Malawi [2015] UKUT 260 (IAC).

20. Lastly, the grounds contend that the FtJ failed to give weight  to  the
    fact that the appellant's husband is a British citizen,  that  being  a
    factor which should weigh heavily against expecting a family member  to
    relocate to maintain their family life.  The FtJ was in  error,  it  is
    said, in taking into account that the appellant's husband  had  resided
    in Nigeria, even though that was some 30 years ago.

21. In submissions, Mr Jarvis contended that the FtJ was entitled  to  come
    to the decision that she did.  She was  aware  that  the  couple's  IVF
    treatment was the centrepiece of their reason for wanting  to  stay  in
    the UK.  However, she referred at [54]  to  the  availability  of  such
    treatment in Nigeria.  The decision in Agyarko, in particular at  [43],
    indicated that the test for insurmountable obstacles was  a  very  high
    one.

22. The fact that the appellant could speak  English  and  was  financially
    independent was not a matter that could assist the appellant positively
    in the proportionality assessment, having regard to the decision in  AM
    (Malawi).  The appellant had been in the UK unlawfully since  2008  and
    had entered into a relationship when she was not lawfully  here.   That
    relationship could continue in Nigeria.

23. It was true that there was an issue in relation to the structure of the
    FtJ's decision, but the substance of  it  showed  that  she  had  given
    sustainable reasons  for  rejecting  the  appeal.   There  was  nothing
    materially different in this appeal from the circumstances  in  Agyarko
    and Ruppiah v Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2016]  EWCA
    Civ 803.

24. The appellant in reply said that she wanted to stay in the UK  so  that
    she could continue her treatment.  She also  referred  to  Nigeria  not
    being a safe place.  She  stated  that  her  parents  live  in  a  two-
    bedroomed house and her sister lives with them.  She would have nowhere
    to stay if she went there.

25. An operation for her husband had been planned but had to  be  cancelled
    as he had high blood pressure.  The next date for the operation  is  in
    November.  The best case scenario was that treatment would be  finished
    in December or in January or February next year.

26. I allowed the appellant's husband the opportunity  of  adding  anything
    further that he wanted to.  He  said  that  he  is  incomplete  without
    having a family.  His mother is sick.  He has to  send  money  for  his
    father who had become ill by being bitten by a snake.   Separating  him
    from his wife would not be appropriate.

    Conclusions

27. I do not consider that the grounds of appeal have any  merit.   If  the
    FtJ's decision is looked at as a composite whole,  it  cannot  be  said
    that she failed to take into account the matters set out at [2] of  the
    grounds.  She took into account the availability of  IVF  treatment  in
    Nigeria, the costs that had been incurred so far by the  appellant  and
    her spouse, and  the  potential  disparity  in  the  efficacy  of  such
    treatment.

28. The complaint in the  grounds  about  the  FtJ  having  said  that  the
    appellant and her husband had only spent  �300  for  six  visits  to  a
    clinic, whereas the true figure is in excess of  �3,000,  is  similarly
    not a complaint that has any substance.  It is true that  at  [30],  in
    summarising the appellant's evidence, she said that the  appellant  had
    said that they had paid �300 for  fertility  treatment;  but  that  was
    clearly a slip  of  the  pen.   At  [21]  she  correctly  recorded  the
    appellant's evidence as being that they had already spent about �3,000.
     In relation to the evidence of  the  appellant's  brother-in-law,  she
    referred at [39] to his evidence that  he  had  given  the  appellant's
    husband �2,350.  Furthermore, at [17] she referred to  the  appellant's
    evidence that the tests that the appellant had undergone had been at  a
    cost of �2,500 and that that debt  remained  outstanding.   At  [19]  a
    figure of �2,200 for treatment in Nigeria is referred to.

29. There is nothing at all to indicate that the FtJ minimised the issue of
    the cost of IVF treatment, either in terms of what had been expended so
    far, or what might have to be expended were the  couple  to  return  to
    Nigeria.

30. The contention that the FtJ had erred in finding  that  there  were  no
    exceptional circumstances meriting a grant of  leave  under  Article  8
    outside the Rules, is simply a disagreement with the FtJ's  assessment.
    Such disagreement plainly, of itself, does not translate into an  error
    of law.

31. The  grounds  in  relation  to  s.117B  are  plainly  contrary  to  the
    conclusions of the Upper Tribunal in AM (Malawi)  which  were  that  an
    appellant cannot claim any positive benefit  in  proportionality  terms
    from  matters  such  as  being  able  to  speak  English  or  by  being
    financially independent.  The contention that because there are factors
    under s.117B which are favourable to the appellant that should work  in
    her favour, is inconsistent with the decision in AM (Malawi),  contrary
    to what is suggested in the grounds.

32. Further, the  suggestion  that  there  are  no  countervailing  factors
    militating against the grant of leave, and that allowing the  appellant
    to remain would not in any way compromise the respondent's  ability  to
    maintain effective immigration control, simply ignores  the  fact  that
    the appellant's status in the UK is an unlawful one and  has  been  for
    approximately  nine  years.   That  she  is  said  to  have  become  an
    overstayer as a result of domestic abuse at the  hands  of  her  former
    husband does not change that fact.

33. As regards the appellant's husband's British citizenship, it  is  plain
    that the FtJ was well aware of that fact, referring to it, for example,
    at [51].  Furthermore, at [65] she referred to the appellant's  husband
    as a "qualifying partner" within the terms of s.117B.  The mere fact of
    the appellant's husband's citizenship could not possibly in  law  be  a
    basis for a conclusion that there would be insurmountable obstacles  to
    their continuing their family life in Nigeria, or that his  citizenship
    must necessarily result in the  appeal  being  allowed  otherwise  than
    under the Rules. Neither the legislative regime, nor the authorities on
    the point, both domestic and European, support such a proposition.

34. What is said at  [9]  of  the  grounds  in  terms  of  the  FtJ  having
    diminished the important matter of the  appellant's  husband's  British
    citizenship by referring to his previous residence in Nigeria  some  30
    years ago, is factually incorrect on two counts.  In the  first  place,
    his evidence was that he came to the UK 25 years ago.  Secondly the FtJ
    did not in her conclusions refer to her husband's previous residence in
    Nigeria.  What she in fact said at [51] was that the appellant's spouse
    had returned to Nigeria in the past, as had his brother,  and  that  it
    was clear that there are family members still residing there.  That was
    the evidence that was before her.

35. None of the grounds therefore, have any substance.  However,  there  is
    an odd feature of the FtJ's decision which it is important to refer to.
     In my summary of the FtJ's decision I referred to the  fact  that  the
    FtJ dismissed the appeal and then commenced several further  paragraphs
    under the heading of "Submissions".  The  way  that  this  decision  is
    structured could lead to the impression that the FtJ made up  her  mind
    about the appeal before taking into account the submissions made by the
    parties.

36. I do consider that this is  an  unfortunate  structural  error  in  the
    decision of this experienced judge.  However, when  one  looks  at  the
    decision as a whole, it is apparent that  this  is  a  defect  of  form
    rather than of substance.  The FtJ made findings on all the matters  in
    issue and, considered those findings within a correct  appreciation  of
    the law.

37. Even if it could be said to have been an error of law for  the  FtJ  to
    have structured her decision in the way that she did, I cannot see that
    it is an error of law  that  is  material  to  the  outcome,  when  one
    considers her findings.  If the FtJ had put the submissions  on  behalf
    of the parties at an appropriate  place  within  her  decision,  it  is
    evident that the outcome would have been to dismiss the appeal  in  any
    event.

38. She concluded, with satisfactory reasons, that the  appellant  and  her
    spouse would not encounter insurmountable obstacles to their continuing
    their family  life  in  Nigeria.   Difficulties,  or  even  significant
    difficulties, are not sufficient. The threshold is a high one.

39. Similarly, she satisfactorily concluded that there would  not  be  very
    significant obstacles to the  appellant's  integration  into  her  home
    country.  In that context she took into account the appellant's wish to
    continue with IVF treatment.  The evidence before her was to the effect
    that that treatment could continue in Nigeria.

40. She likewise took that matter into account when assessing whether there
    were exceptional circumstances meriting a grant of leave otherwise than
    under the Rules but she justifiably concluded that there were  no  such
    exceptional circumstances, even taking into account what she  described
    as "[an] unusual feature" of the case, namely the appellant's desire to
    continue with IVF treatment in the UK.

41. She was bound to take into account that  the  appellant's  relationship
    with her spouse was established at a  time  when  she  was  in  the  UK
    unlawfully.  She was similarly bound to  take  into  account  that  her
    private life was established at a time when her immigration status  was
    precarious.

  42. Whilst the appellant and her  husband's  desire  to  obtain  the  most
      effective IVF treatment possible, which for them  means  remaining  in
      the UK, is entirely understandable, that is not  a  matter  that  must
      mean that the appellant should be granted leave to remain in  the  UK.
      The appellant's desire for a  different  outcome  from  that  achieved
      before the First-tier Tribunal is not  a  basis  for  concluding  that
      there is any error of law in the FtJ's decision.

43. It is furthermore worth pointing out that the facts of this appellant's
    appeal are not dissimilar to those of the appellant  Ikuga  decided  by
    the Supreme Court in the decision which I have cited as Agyarko & Ikuga
    v Secretary of State for the Home Department.

44. I do not underestimate the impact on the appellant and her  husband  of
    the FtJ's, and indeed my, decision. Their feelings were very evident at
    the hearing before me. However, the fact is that the  decision  of  the
    FTJ is free from any material error of law and the decision to  dismiss
    the appeal must stand.

    Decision

45. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal does not involve the making  of
    an error on a point  of  law.   Its  decision  to  dismiss  the  appeal
    therefore stands.
