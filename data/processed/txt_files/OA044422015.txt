For the Respondent:    -


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Respondent is a national of India date of birth  30th  April  1964.
    On the 4th January 2016 the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Hussain) allowed
    her appeal  against a decision to refuse to grant her  entry  clearance
    as a domestic worker  in  a  private  household.  The  Entry  Clearance
    Officer in Abu Dhabi (ECO) now has permission to  appeal  against  that
    decision.



 2. The original decision appealed against  was  dated  the  23rd  February
    2015. The ECO considered the application with  reference  to  paragraph
    159A of the Rules and found that he could not  be  satisfied  that  the
    terms of sub-paragraph  (v)  were  met.  This  provision  requires  the
    applicant to show that she:
            (v) has agreed in writing terms and conditions of employment in
            the UK with the employer, including specifically that the
            applicant will be paid in accordance with the National Minimum
            Wage Act 1998 and any Regulations made under it, and provides
            evidence of this in the form set out in Appendix 7 with the
            entry clearance application; and
            (va)  satisfies the Entry Clearance Officer or Immigration
            Officer that, throughout their employment in the UK, the
            employer intends to pay them at least the National Minimum Wage
            rate to which they are entitled by the law in force at the
            relevant time; and
            (vb) provides a written and signed statement from the employer
            confirming that the applicant is an employee and the work that
            will be carried out by the applicant will not constitute work
            within the meaning of paragraph 57 of the National Minimum Wage
            Regulations 2015 (as amended from time to time);
    The ECO noted that this applicant (the Appellant) had signed a contract
    agreeing to be paid �100 per  week  whilst  she  was  working  for  her
    employer in the UK. The application was therefore refused.


 3. When the matter came before Judge Hussain on the papers  the  Appellant
    relied on grounds  of  appeal  written  by  her  employer.  Therein  Mr
    Mohammad Fakhruddin Ajmal explained that for the duration of his annual
    holiday in the  UK  the  Appellant  would  be  working  for  him  as  a
    housemaid. She has worked for his family for over ten years and is paid
    a "handsome salary" for domestic staff from Asia working  in  the  UAE.
    He writes that in addition to the sum offered in her contract, she will
    be supplied with free food, accommodation and he will pay her air fare.
     Mr Ajmal explains that he followed the advice of VFS  Global  when  he
    filled in the form.


 4. On the basis of these submissions the First-tier  Tribunal  found  that
    the requirements of the Rules were satisfied.  It took into account the
    fact that the Appellant and her employer had been wrongly advised about
    the requirements and accepted that had they been aware of the terms  of
    the actual rule, the contract would have been written in such a way  as
    to comply.

 5. The Entry Clearance  Officer  now  appeals  on  the  grounds  that  the
    findings were unclear and insofar as they accept that the  requirements
    would have been met, are entirely speculative. I agree.  Setting  aside
    the fact that the relevant date for the purpose of this entry clearance
    appeal was the date of decision, the evidence still falls well short of
    establishing that the Appellant would be paid the minimum wage for  the
    duration of her trip. Mr Ajmal, and the First-tier Tribunal, appear  to
    consider that the cost of her airfare can  be  taken  into  account  in
    working out whether she will be earning the right amount.  That  cannot
    be right. The expenses that a private employer pays to get his  workers
    to the place he wants the work done is not part of their  remuneration.
    Nor, arguably, should their food and accommodation  costs  be  counted.
    Even if the latter could be taken into account, it is  far  from  clear
    whether these would increase the Appellant's  wages  to  an  acceptable
    standard, given that she was to be paid only �100 for a six  day  week,
    working at 8 hours per day. By my calculations her basic  rate  of  pay
    would therefore have been �2.08 per hour.


 6. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside. The errors of law
    is making a finding not  supported  by  the  evidence.  I  re-make  the
    decision in the appeal by dismissing it.
