Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms S Allen of Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, a Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh who was  born  on  1  December
    1985.  He was granted leave to enter the UK on 13 September 2007

 2. He entered the UK on a student visa granted on 13  September  2007.  He
    was subsequently granted leave to remain as a post  study  migrant  and
    general migrant until 31 May 2013. On 23 May 2013 the appellant made an
    application for leave to remain as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant under the
    points  based  system  and  for  a  Biometric  Residence  Permit.  This
    application was refused by  the  respondent  on  10  March  2014.   The
    respondent also decided to remove the appellant under Section 47 of the
    Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.  The respondent  was  not
    satisfied that the appellant had scored the requisite points to qualify
    for leave to remain as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant on the  grounds  that
    he failed to score the number of points required  under  appendix  A  -
    attributes.

The appeal against the respondent's decision



 3. The appellant appealed against the respondent's decision to the  First-
    tier Tribunal and in a decision of 31 October 2014 First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Cohen dismissed the appellant's appeal.  Following  a  successful
    appeal against that  decision  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  the  case  was
    remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for a de novo hearing.

 4. That de-novo hearing  took  place  on  18  July  2016.  In  a  decision
    promulgated on 3 August 2016 First-tier Tribunal Judge  Meah  dismissed
    the  appellant's  appeal.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  found  that   the
    appellant had failed to show that he is engaged in  self-employment  as
    claimed.  The judge found that the appellant had failed to explain  why
    he could not provide proper details about the services  he  claimed  to
    provide by way of his self-employment.

 5. The appellant applied for permission to appeal against  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's decision to the Upper Tribunal.  On 7 December  2016  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Page granted the appellant  permission  to  appeal.
    Thus, the appeal came before me.

The appeal to the Upper Tribunal

Submissions

 6. The grounds of appeal assert that the First-tier Tribunal judge  failed
    to make adequate findings, failed to consider evidence,  made  findings
    based on speculation and made statements which  are  contradictory  and
    unclear.  It is argued that the judge accepted, at paragraph  32,  that
    technically the tax assessment evidence, taken together  with  some  of
    the other documentary evidence provided may be sufficient to create the
    impression that the appellant could be earning what he stated.   It  is
    asserted that issues raised  by  the  respondent  in  the  Reasons  for
    Refusal  Letter  (namely  that  the  appellant  does  not  have  public
    liability insurance and whether the appellant can provide his  services
    at clients' premises  or  public  venues  such  as  caf�s)  were  noted
    together with the  explanations  but  the  judge  failed  to  make  any
    findings in respect of these two issues.   It  is  submitted  that  the
    judge failed  to  take  into  account  the  appellant's  evidence  when
    considering why he had a number of bank accounts, why clients hired him
    when he could not provide a certificate and the details of the work  he
    carried out.  It is asserted that at paragraphs 24 to 26 the judge  was
    incorrect to find that the submission  regarding  the  number  of  bank
    accounts (due to incentivised banking  schemes)  were  speculative  and
    therefore the reasons for the multiple  accounts  remained  unexplained
    and ambiguous. This finding fails to take into account paragraph 13  of
    the  appellant's  updated  statement  for  the  appeal  hearing.   This
    paragraph refers to the different facilities given by  different  banks
    and that the appellant was looking for effective bank  accounts.   This
    paragraph specifically refers to the Halifax Bank opening two  accounts
    and requires a monthly transaction of �750.  Paragraph 13  states  that
    the bank "also gives me �5 every month to run the account".  The  judge
    was referred to the bank statements showing this reward.

 7. It is asserted that having found, at paragraph 23, that  weight  should
    be given to the appellant's answers at interview rather than to answers
    the appellant had given at  the  hearing,  the  judge  then  failed  to
    consider at all the answers that the appellant gave in the interview at
    question 5 of the specific interview questions.  When asked if  he  had
    provided certified proof  of  completed  qualifications  the  appellant
    stated that he did not teach specific qualifications and  that  he  did
    not know anyone who gives certificates  other  than  institutions,  but
    that he was providing extra tuition.   Paragraph  16  of  the  decision
    where the judge states that the appellant was not  able  to  provide  a
    proper answer other than the fact that  he  also  works  for  a  multi-
    national company failed to take into account the  appellant's  evidence
    at the hearing that he was providing extra tuition and has  a  relevant
    Bachelor of Science and Masters and  work  experience.   The  appellant
    provided other evidence of what he was providing, for example to  Abdul
    Majid Ahmed who was setting up a new business and wanted  training  for
    himself and new staff, and that the appellant  provided  assistance  to
    clients who were looking  for  jobs  and  that  he  had  relevant  work
    experience in a multi-national company.  He provides advice for  people
    applying for jobs as to the practical questions.

 8. It is asserted that at paragraph 21  the  judge  accepted  that  it  is
    likely there would be widely available alternatives to the appellant at
    these costs and therefore found  it  incredible  that  the  appellant's
    services would have been chosen in favour of any  better  alternatives.
    It is submitted that this finding had no evidential basis and is  based
    on speculation.

 9. It is asserted that at paragraph 22 the judge failed to  consider  that
    the interview was on 22 April 2014, a year or more after the  work  for
    particular clients was carried out.  In the alternative it is submitted
    that the judge has made  contradictory  and  unclear  statements  which
    confirm that he has failed  to  take  into  account  all  the  evidence
    presented to him.  At paragraph 30 the judge found that notwithstanding
    that he has had ample time to brush-up the appellant's answers  at  the
    hearing were poor.  It is submitted  that  the  judge's  acceptance  at
    paragraph 23 appears to confirm that the judge he failed to take proper
    account of the appellant's written statement and his oral evidence.

10. At the hearing Ms Allen submitted that the finding at paragraph 21  was
    purely speculative and demonstrated a  lack  of  understanding  of  the
    evidence on the part of  the  judge.   She  submitted  that  the  issue
    regarding why people would employ the appellant  when  they  could  get
    certified courses does  not  consider  the  explanation  given  by  the
    appellant which is that he provides training and extra assistance  such
    as to help people to answer questions in job interviews.  She submitted
    that the judge had no evidence on which to make the  finding  that  she
    did and that this was entirely speculative.

11. She submitted that the  appellant  at  the  hearing  did  provide  more
    detailed answers, for example at the hearing he gave evidence regarding
    the client Sweet Angel Ltd, but that that evidence was not  taken  into
    account at all.  She submitted that because of the  approach  taken  at
    paragraph 23, that is that the judge considered that weight  should  be
    placed on the initial interview, the judge failed to make findings on a
    number of issues. She submitted that the  judge  failed  to  take  into
    account  the  appellant's  witness  statements  with  regard   to   the
    explanation for the various bank accounts or the  tax  assessments.   I
    asked Ms Allen if she could take me to any evidence of payments made to
    HMRC other than a payment made for  national  insurance  contributions,
    i.e. where are the payments from the bank accounts that were  submitted
    in support of the self-employment to HMRC?  Ms Allen could not point to
    any evidence of payments in this regard.

12. Mr Tufan submitted that there was a specific issue with regard  to  the
    bank  statements  and  referred  to  question  14  of  the  appellant's
    interview.  He submitted that  although  attempts  have  been  made  to
    explain the various bank accounts, the incentive appears to relate only
    to one account, the Halifax account.  The other  accounts  have  simply
    not  been  explained.  He  submitted  that  it  is   clear   from   the
    determination that whilst the judge has not spelt out  every  piece  of
    evidence, he has considered all the evidence.  He  submitted  that  the
    issue was how many clients and what work the appellant was  doing,  and
    from question 6 of the interview it is clear that the appellant was not
    sure.  It is quite clear that the appellant was almost at a loss as  to
    what services he  provides.   With  regard  to  inadequate  reasons  he
    submitted the judge has given reasons sufficient for the  appellant  to
    know why the judge has reached the decision.  The challenge was in fact
    an irrationality challenge in the cloak of  a  reasons  challenge.   He
    submitted that the lack of evidence of  any  payments  to  HMRC  was  a
    further factor.

13. Ms Allen in reply argued that  the  specific  questions  asked  at  the
    interview indicate that the appellant  was  not  at  a  loss,  he  gave
    details.   He  was  undertaking  networking,  etc.   She  referred   to
    paragraph 19(i).  The test was whether the money appears  from  genuine
    employment, not borrowed or gifted.  She submitted that  the  appellant
    was registered with HMRC and that there was nothing to suggest that the
    appellant's earnings were not from genuine employment.

Decision

14. As set out at paragraph 6 in  the  First-tier  Tribunal  decision  this
    application was considered under paragraph 245CA of HC 395  Immigration
    Rules (as amended).  The Appellant had claimed 20 points  for  previous
    earnings, but no points were awarded by the respondent, who had applied
    the genuine earnings test as outlined in paragraph 19(i) in Appendix  A
    of the Immigration Rules. The respondent was  not  satisfied  that  the
    earnings claimed from self-employment were from genuine employment.

15. It  is  for  the  appellant  to  demonstrate  that  his  earnings  were
    sufficient to meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules. His claim
    was that in addition to paid employment (from Pervasic  Ltd  which  was
    insufficient to meet the income requirement) he was  self-employed.  In
    accordance with paragraph 19(i) the appellant had to  demonstrate  that
    the  money  was  earned  through  self-employment  rather  than   being
    borrowed, gifted or otherwise.

16. The judge set out his findings from paragraph 10 of the  decision.   In
    paragraphs 13  to  19  the  judge  sets  out  various  aspects  of  the
    appellant's evidence that had been challenged by the respondent  either
    in interview or at the oral hearing.  Throughout the decision the judge
    sets out a number of issues where she has not been satisfied  with  the
    evidence or with the appellant's explanations.  I turn firstly  to  the
    argument that the  judge  at  paragraph  21  has  reached  an  entirely
    speculative finding.  The judge at paragraph 21 set out:

         "21. I also find considerable merit in Ms Sreeraman's argument that
             it is implausible that the appellant would have  been  engaged
             by  individuals  for  tutoring  in  place  of   other   viable
             alternatives where they could acquire some form of  recognised
             certification for their efforts, especially given the  amounts
             the appellant claims to have charged these  people  as  it  is
             likely that such alternatives would  be  widely  available  at
             these costs, hence  it  is  incredible  that  the  appellant's
             services would have been chosen in favour of any other  better
             alternatives by those wishing to advance  their  careers  with
             multinational companies."

17. I accept that the judge has entered into  speculation.   There  was  no
    evidence before the judge that alternatives would be available  at  the
    same cost.  With regard to this finding I consider that the judge  fell
    into error. However, this is only one finding on the overall issue that
    the judge was assessing, namely, whether the appellant  had  proved  to
    the requisite standard that his earnings were from  self-employment  as
    claimed.

18. With regard to the explanation of the work undertaken the judge set out
    at paragraphs 22 and 23:

         "22. The appellant was asked at his Specific Interview at  question
             6, to name his clients and explain in detail the work  he  had
             carried out for  each.   He  provided  three  names  of  three
             individuals and stated he did  'website  service,  PC  trouble
             shooting and networking support'  for  these  individuals  and
             then stated that that was all he could remember at that  time.
             The interview took place in February 2014, and  this  was  not
             long after he  said  he  had  been  engaging  in  these  self-
             employment activities hence I find that this was  also  highly
             incredible, as I would have expected him to be  able  to  reel
             off quite easily the details of the exact nature  of  what  he
             did with his clients at that time given that this  would  have
             been fresh in his mind then.

         23.  Ms  Sreeraman  argued  that  it  was  important  to  take  the
             appellant's answers to the questions at his specific interview
             into account and attach weight to these, as  this  was  indeed
             closer to the period in question, as opposed to giving greater
             credence  to  anything  the  appellant  might  say  now.   The
             appellant has of course had a number of years to brush  up  on
             all of this whilst his appeal has been outstanding, especially
             given that he has been aware of the issues all along  hence  I
             find considerable merit in Ms  Sreeraman's  argument  on  this
             count.  It is also noteworthy that the appellant confirmed  in
             both interviews at the outset that he was  fit  and  well  and
             able to proceed with the interview and  there  is  nothing  to
             indicate  on  the  transcripts  that  any  difficulties  arose
             either.



19. The judge was entitled to attach greater weight to answers given at the
    time of the interview. The judge had the benefit of seeing the
    appellant and hearing him give oral evidence at the hearing. At
    paragraph 27 the judge recorded:


         'The appellant's evidence in court was strenuous and difficult and
         I find that he has still failed to properly show that he was/is
         genuinely self-employed as claimed. ..'

20. The judge considered fully the submission that  satisfactory  responses
    had been given and also the explanation  offered  in  relation  to  the
    appellant's poor oral testimony in court:

         28.     Ms Allen stated that satisfactory responses had been  given
             to all the points raised in the refusal  and  this  should  be
             accepted.  In relation to the appellant's poor oral  testimony
             in court, I was told that he has anxiety and depression issues
             for which he has been referred to talking therapy on the  NHS.
             I received in evidence some NHS letters referring to  this  at
             pages 6 and 7, alongside another letter  dated  1  July  2016,
             also from the NHS where the therapist states  the  appellant's
             'problems' seem to be depression and anxiety.

         29.  Whilst I have noted the diagnosis which is qualified with  the
             word 'seem' in the latest NHS letter, I do not find that  this
             is sufficient to explain the appellant's  repeated  poor  oral
             evidence regarding his claimed self-employment activities.

         30.  I took the time at the hearing to ensure  that  the  appellant
             was afforded every opportunity to answer carefully  and  in  a
             full and measured way the very pertinent questions put to  him
             during cross-examination including catering for the fact  that
             he might have been nervous as many  appellants  and  witnesses
             often are when giving evidence in court, yet despite  treating
             him with 'kid gloves', his evidence was poignantly lacking  in
             any real detail and I formed the distinct view, after  hearing
             him, that his responses were entirely incredible  despite  the
             fact that he has now been  interviewed/asked  questions  about
             his self-employment on many  occasions  during  the  last  few
             years hence if anything, I would have expected his answers  to
             be far more forthcoming and not as bad as  they  were  at  the
             hearing, notwithstanding the fact that he has had  ample  time
             to brush up on all of this.

21. The judge has clearly considered all the evidence.  A  judge  does  not
    need to set out each individual piece of evidence considered. The judge
    has provided sufficient  detail  to  demonstrate  why  he  reached  his
    findings.

22. With regard to the submission that the judge failed to make findings on
    the public liability insurance and venue issues the judge recorded:

         24.  I have noted Ms Allen's attempts to provide explanation to the
             issues raised in the refusal letter such as the fact that  the
             appellant is not legally required  to  have  public  liability
             insurance, a point raised by the respondent, and  that  it  is
             not unusual to provide  tuition  of  the  type  the  appellant
             claims he is engaged in at either the client's premises or  in
             caf�s and outside public venues.

23. I accept that the judge has not made a finding in respect of these  two
    specific issues. It is not clear whether the  judge  found  that  these
    issues adversely affected the appellant's credibility.  However,  these
    were two of a number of  overall  issues  raised  in  the  reasons  for
    refusal letter. As set out  above  the  judge  clearly  considered  the
    evidence as a whole when arriving at his conclusions and  set  out  the
    factors that she considered detracted from the appellant's credibility.
    I do not consider that the  failure  to  make  a  specific  finding  in
    relation to these two issues amounts to a material error of law.

24. With regard to explanations for the numerous bank  accounts  the  judge
    recorded:

             '24....I also noted her arguments  regarding  the  appellant's
             numerous bank accounts which  were  also  highlighted  in  the
             refusal which the appellant  struggled  to  explain,  yet  she
             submitted, for the first time at the appeal hearing,  that  he
             had these multiple accounts as it was a way of  achieving  and
             capitalising on incentives various banks might offer when  new
             accounts are opened.

         25.  In relation to this latter point this was not the  appellant's
             evidence at any  stage  either  at  his  interviews  with  the
             respondent or, at the hearing during his oral testimony.   The
             specific interview notes show that he was unable  to  properly
             explain why he had  so  many  bank  accounts.   He  stated  in
             response to  question  5  of  his  interview  regarding  these
             accounts as follows, 'because I opened  them  I  forget  about
             them.  Is it a crime to have so many?  ... I  want  to  that's
             why'.  He then stated in response to question  20  when  asked
             why he had transferred money between  several  accounts  on  a
             regular basis 'because it's  just  you  know,  when  you  have
             account, you have to transfer the money to  manage  my  funds.
             To keep all of my accounts active'.

         26.  It can be seen that the appellant's responses are nowhere near
             the speculation Ms Allen advanced that the reason  for  having
             multiple accounts was to  benefit  from  incentivised  banking
             schemes hence I find that this submission is misplaced and the
             answers given by the appellant regarding his multiple accounts
             therefore remains unexplained and  ambiguous,  especially  the
             responses to the interview question on this, and I  find  that
             this also further detracts his credibility.'

25. The explanation regarding incentives  potentially  explained  only  the
    holding of the two Halifax accounts. The appellant had 8 accounts  with
    4 different banks with funds moving from one to another. The finding of
    the judge  that  the  reason  for  having  multiple  accounts  remained
    unexplained and ambiguous was one that was open to him on the evidence.

26. With regard to the findings in respect of the tax assessments the judge
    set out:

         '31. Ms Allen asked me to consider the appellant's tax  assessments
             and the fact that this indicated he was earning the amount  he
             had claimed  which  was  sufficient  to  satisfy  the  Tier  1
             provisions under which he had sought to extend his stay in the
             UK.

         32.  Whilst I accept that technically this evidence alongside  some
             of the other documentary evidence  presented  to  support  the
             appeal, when viewed in isolation, may be sufficient to  create
             the impression that the appellant could  be  earning  what  he
             stated, the question for me to consider is whether this  self-
             employment is genuine in the context of Rule 19(i).

         33.  Having taken in account all of the evidence presented  to  me,
             including taking a holistic view of  this  as  was  vehemently
             requested by both representatives, I find that  the  appellant
             has failed to show, even on balance, that he is engaged in the
             self-employment he claims.  I therefore find the  respondent's
             refusal of his application was correct and  lawful.   I  noted
             that he stated in his witness statement at paragraph 20, inter
             alia, that he suffers from short memory  due  to  his  'mental
             health illness' however, there is  no  evidence  showing  that
             this is the case hence again, I find that  the  appellant  has
             failed to explain why he cannot provide proper  details  about
             the services he claimed  he  provided  by  way  of  his  self-
             employment  to  the  named  individuals  in  the  invoices  he
             provided to support his application and appeal."

27. The judge duly noted that  they  were  potentially  supportive  of  the
    appellant's claim. There was no evidence of any  payments  to  HMRC  in
    respect of those tax assessments  in  the  bank  statements  that  were
    submitted by the appellant to support his claim.  The  tax  assessments
    were only one element of the evidence. The judge took into account  all
    the evidence and had the benefit of seeing the appellant and  assessing
    first hand his credibility. The findings of the judge  were  ones  that
    were open to him. There was no material error of law.

Notice of Decision
