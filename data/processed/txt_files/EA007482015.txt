Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr P Richardson instructed by Aston Bond Law Ltd
For the Respondent:    Mr A Holmes, a Senior Home Office Presenting Officer



                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals with permission against the decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal dismissing his appeal against the respondent's refusal to
    grant him a residence permit evidencing his right  of  residence  under
    the Immigration (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations  2006,  as  the
    spouse of a Polish citizen  exercising  Treaty  rights  in  the  United
    Kingdom.  The appellant's wife, being Polish, is an  EEA  citizen;  the
    appellant is a Pakistani citizen.

Refusal Letter

 2. In the letter of refusal there were two matters in dispute,  the  first
    being whether the marriage was one  of  convenience,  and  the  second,
    whether the appellant's Polish spouse was a qualified person under  the
    Regulations.  Before the First-tier Tribunal the question of  the  wife
    being a qualified person was conceded and was no longer in dispute.

 3. The reasoning in relation to marriage of convenience in the  letter  of
    refusal is relatively short.  It says this:

         "Given the many discrepancies regarding your  place  of  residence,
         this department is not satisfied that you and your EEA sponsor  are
         residing together.  Whilst it is noted that you have provided  many
         documents  such  as  bank  statements  and  utility  bills,   these
         documents are not evidence that you  are  residing  together.   The
         documents provided imply that  you  both  have  post  sent  to  the
         addresses in question.  It is also noted that you started  studying
         at  North  West  College,  Reading  in  January  2014  [before  the
         relationship began].  However, you then said that you stopped  your
         studies in the summer of 2014.  Furthermore, your EEA sponsor  said
         that you stopped studying at North  West  College  in  February  or
         March 2014.

         You informed the interviewing officer that you wanted to remain  in
         the United Kingdom to  continue  your  studies  towards  your  MBA.
         However, you informed the interviewing officer  that  you  had  not
         been doing anything since the summer of 2014.  You  confirmed  that
         you had not made any  applications  to  colleges  or  universities.
         Your EEA sponsor said that you hadn't  been  doing  anything  since
         February or March 2014.

         It is noted that your EEA  sponsor  said  she  had  no  idea  which
         particular  college  or  university  you  would  be  interested  in
         attending.  You said that  you  had  looked  into  attending  Royal
         Holloway University and Brunel University.   You  were  then  asked
         questions regarding your wedding venue.  You  said  you  both  were
         married in Watford because the registry office closest to  you  did
         not have the dates available that you wanted.  You confirmed  there
         was no other reason.  Your EEA sponsor  said  that  you  were  both
         married in Watford because your local registry office did not  have
         date available for when you wanted to marry.  She also stated  that
         you both have friends in Watford  making  it  easier  for  them  to
         attend your wedding ceremony...".

    On that basis, the respondent concluded that this marriage was  one  of
    convenience and refused to issue a residence permit.





Marriages of Convenience

 4. Under Regulation 17 of the EEA Regulations, the Respondent must issue a
    residence permit to a person who is the spouse of an EEA  national  who
    is a qualified person (that is to say, exercising Treaty rights in  the
    United Kingdom).  Under Regulation 2, spouse is defined as excluding  a
    party to a marriage of convenience.  Marriage  of  convenience  is  not
    defined.

 5. The law in relation to marriages of convenience  is  contained  in  the
    case of Papajorgji (EEA spouse - marriage of convenience) Greece [2012]
    UKUT 003038 (IAC)  and  the  judicial  guidance  therein  given  is  as
    follows:

         "(i) There is no burden at the outset  of  an  application  on  the
             claimant to demonstrate that a marriage to an EEA national  is
             not one of convenience.

         (ii)  IS  (marriages  of  convenience)  Serbia  [2008]   UKAIT   31
             establishes only that there is an  evidential  burden  on  the
             claimant to address evidence justifying  reasonable  suspicion
             that the marriage is entered into for the predominant  purpose
             of securing residence rights.

         (iii)    The Guidance of the EU Commission is noted and appended."

 6. The position has been considered subsequently by the Court of Appeal in
    Rosa v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2016] EWCA Civ 14 in
    which the court found that both the  legal  and  evidential  burden  of
    showing that the marriage is a marriage of  convenience  are  upon  the
    respondent.  In Rosa, the Court of Appeal said this:
         "In my judgment the legal burden lies on the Secretary of State  to
         prove that an otherwise valid marriage is a marriage of convenience
         so as to justify the refusal of an application for a residence card
         under the EEA Regs."

First-tier Tribunal decision

 7. The First-tier Tribunal Judge was  required  to  consider  whether  the
    respondent had discharged the legal and  evidential  burden  upon  her.
    She cited Papajorgji and set out the judicial guidance at paragraph  26
    but she then, at paragraph 37, said this:

         "The respondent refused the application under Regulation 2  of  the
         2006 Regulations.  In in-country immigration appeals the burden  of
         proof is on the appellant to establish that all requirements of the
         applicable immigration rules can be met.   The  standard  of  proof
         required is the civil law balance of probabilities (that  is  'more
         likely than not').  I may consider evidence about any matter  which
         I think relevant  to  the  substance  of  the  decision,  including
         evidence which concerns a matter arising  after  the  date  of  the
         decision."

 8. In the context of an EEA residence permit case that  self-direction  is
    wrong.  The correct self-direction is that  the  respondent  bears  the
    burden of showing whether this is in fact  a  marriage  of  convenience
    both as to law and as to facts and only then is it  necessary  for  the
    appellant to rebut the primary case raised by the respondent.

 9. EEA Regulation cases do not fall under the  Immigration  Rules  because
    the free movement right is a right  for  a  qualifying  person  in  the
    United Kingdom to be accompanied by their spouse  or,  in  some  cases,
    extended family members.

10. At paragraph 37 the judge set out the things that she found  in  common
    between the two accounts of the parties at paragraphs 40 to 46  of  the
    decision.  It is not necessary to rehearse those in  detail  here,  but
    there was a high degree of consistency in the  accounts  given  by  the
    appellant and sponsor.  Neither of them made  any  significant  variant
    account of any particular.

11. At paragraph 47 the judge said this:

         "On the balance of probabilities, looking at the  totality  of  the
         information, whilst the appellant and  his  wife  provided  largely
         consistent answers at the marriage interview, the answers given and
         the documents provided were evidence not of a genuine marriage  but
         of a shared residence; there were letters provided  in  support  of
         the appellant's claimed genuine marriage, but no witnesses attended
         the appeal hearing to adopt their letters  and  be  cross-examined;
         the appellant did not comply with the  requirement  to  update  the
         respondent as to the change  in  his  address  from  130  Hawthorne
         Close, even when he became aware of the problems that  his  college
         was facing with its status and the appellant became  engaged  after
         he was unable to continue his studies and prior to  contacting  the
         respondent to resolve his immigration status;  the  appellant  made
         six money transfers to his wife  and  the  reason  given  that  the
         appellant had transferred the significant sum of �1,000, as he  had
         lost his bank card, was not a credible one, as the appellant left a
         sum of around �400 in his account and direct debits were made after
         the date of the transfer, that he should be transferring small sums
         was not consistent with the joint nature of  financial  commitments
         to be expected of those in a genuine marriage  and  the  appellant,
         and his wife, admitted that  they  gave  a  false  address  to  the
         Watford Registry  office  in  order  to  marry  there.   For  these
         reasons, I find that the marriage is one of convenience."

Error of law finding

12. There is no 'shared residence' test in the jurisprudence  on  marriages
    of convenience.  The respondent has to show  that,  at  the  moment  of
    marriage, the parties did not have the intention to enter into  a  real
    marital relationship with each other.  Whether or not that involves any
    physical relationship is not a matter for the  respondent  or  for  the
    Tribunal judge:  our analysis stops before the bedroom door.

13. What is important is to ascertain the intentions of  the  parties  when
    they married.  The burden is on the respondent to show that there is  a
    fraudulent element to that intention and that the  marriage  is  solely
    one of convenience.

14. The First-tier Tribunal Judge's reasoning neither places the burden  of
    proof on the respondent, nor considers the central  question.   I  find
    that her reasoning is inadequate to the standard set  by  Lord  Justice
    Brook at paragraph 90.2 and 90.3 of R (Iran) & Ors v Secretary of State
    for the Home Department [2005] EWCA Civ 982.  I therefore set aside the
    First-tier Tribunal decision and  proceed  to  re-make  it  for  myself
    today.

Remaking the decision

15. In order to establish that this  is  a  marriage  of  convenience,  the
    Respondent must show that the marriage is not only not genuine  but  so
    lacking in content that it is plainly a fraud on the EEA free  movement
    system.  Assistance is available in making that analysis  from  the  EU
    Commission Handbook on addressing the issue  of  alleged  marriages  of
    convenience between EU citizens and non-EU nationals in the context  of
    EU law on free movement of EU citizens SWD (2014) 284, published on  26
    September 2014.  I can find no evidence that the  respondent  is  using
    that tool in her analysis of marriages of convenience.

16. The evidence relied upon by the respondent is insufficient to discharge
    either the legal or the evidential burden of showing that this marriage
    is a fraud on the EEA free movement system.

17. The First-tier Tribunal decision sets out carefully the many  areas  of
    concurrence in the evidence of the appellant  and  his  wife,  but  the
    respondent's decision does not focus on the moment of marriage.   There
    is some investigation as to why the parties married in Watford, but  on
    the evidence before the respondent, and the evidence before the  First-
    tier Tribunal, I am  not  satisfied  that  such  evidence  demonstrated
    fraudulent intent or that there was a lack of intention to enter into a
    real relationship.

18. I do not consider, on the totality of the evidence, that the respondent
    has discharged either the evidential or the legal burden  upon  her  of
    showing that this was a marriage of convenience. That is the end of the
    matter: if that burden is not discharged, the appellant is not required
    to rebut it.

19. There being  no  dispute  that  the  wife  is  a  qualifying  person  I
    substitute a decision allowing this appeal and direct the Respondent to
    issue the appellant with a residence permit as the  spouse  of  an  EEA
    citizen.

Conclusions

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.

I set aside the decision.  I re-make the decision in the appeal by  allowing
it.
