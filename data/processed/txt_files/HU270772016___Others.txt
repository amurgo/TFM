For the appellant:     Mrs Sobande, Living Spring Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008
(SI 2008/269) I make an anonymity order. Unless  the  Upper  Tribunal  or  a
Court directs otherwise, no report of  these  proceedings  or  any  form  of
publication thereof shall directly or indirectly identify the appellants.

 1. I have made an anonymity order because  this  decision  refers  to  the
    circumstances of A1's three children - A2, A3 and A4.

Background

 2. A1 is a citizen of Nigeria.  She entered the United Kingdom ('UK') as a
    visitor in 2010 along with A2 (born in 2007), and they overstayed.   A3
    and A4 are twins and were born in the UK in 2010.  All  the  appellants
    reside with A1's mother - B.

 3. In decisions taken  in  2016,  the  respondent  refused  to  grant  the
    appellants leave to remain on the basis of their  human  rights.  In  a
    decision sent on 26  October  2017,  the  First-tier  Tribunal  ('FTT')
    dismissed the appellants' appeals against these  decisions,  and  found
    that it would be reasonable to expect the three  "qualifying  children"
    to live in Nigeria with A1.

 4. In a decision dated 4  September  2018,  Upper  Tribunal  ('UT')  Judge
    Storey considered it arguable that there was an error  of  law  in  the
    application of section 117B(6)  of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002 ('the 2002 Act').

Hearing

 5. At the hearing Mrs Sobande relied upon three grounds of appeal set  out
    in a written skeleton argument.  She also made an application to submit
    further evidence in support of ground one.  Mr Bates did not object  to
    this evidence being submitted  but  invited  me  to  find  it  made  no
    material difference to the FTT's reasoning or ultimate decision.

 6. After hearing from both representatives I reserved my decision, which I
    now give with reasons.

Error of law discussion

 7. The majority of  the  submissions  in  the  grounds  of  appeal  simply
    disagree with the FTT's decision.  There is a repeated  assertion  that
    the FTT failed to properly address the best interests of the  children.
    That  submission  is  hopeless.   The  FTT  clearly  treated  the  best
    interests of the children as a primary consideration at [16], [17]  and
    [30] of its decision.  When the decision is read as a  whole,  the  FTT
    took all relevant matters concerning the  children  into  account  when
    making its assessment on best  interests  and  reasonableness  for  the
    purposes of s.117B(6) of the 2002 Act.

 8. I now turn to the more specific grounds of appeal.

 1) Residence order

 9. Judge Storey regarded the FTT's approach to the reasons  B  obtained  a
    residence  order  in  respect  of   the   children   to   be   arguably
    "problematic".

10. On 1 July 2012 after hearing from A1  and  B,  HHJ  Allweis  granted  a
    residence order in favour of B, in respect of all three  children.   In
    the grounds of appeal, it is asserted  that  the  residence  order  was
    obtained in 2011 but child benefits did not begin to be  paid  to  A1's
    mother until 2015.  At the hearing before me Mrs Sobande accepted  that
    the residence order is dated 1 July  2012.   She  also  relied  upon  a
    letter from HM Revenue and Customs dated 17 April 2015,  that  was  not
    before the FTT.   This informs B that changes were being  made  to  the
    amount of child benefit being paid to her and  records  the  claim  for
    child benefit having been allowed from 22 December 2014, with  a  total
    amount payable of ï¿½74.70 per week.

11. Mrs Sobande invited me to find that this demonstrated a period of  more
    than two years between the residence order and  the  payment  of  child
    benefit.  She submitted that the FTT was therefore mistaken  to  assume
    at [29] of the decision, that it was more  likely  that  the  residence
    order was obtained as a matter of convenience and to enable B to access
    state benefits as opposed to A1  not  being  able  to  look  after  her
    children.

12. Mr Bates submitted that the HMRC evidence did not name the children and
    was insufficient to support the submission being advanced  but  in  any
    event did not materially impact the conclusion on reasonableness.

13. I do not accept that the FTT's reference to the residence order  having
    been obtained as a matter of convenience rather than for the protection
    of the children constitutes an error of law to  justify  setting  aside
    the decision for the reasons I set out below.

14. Firstly, the appellant has not been  able  to  take  me  to  any  clear
    evidence regarding the  timing  of  the  applications  made  for  state
    benefits in respect of the three appellant children.   It  is  for  the
    appellant to establish that the FTT made a mistake of fact that  caused
    unfairness, and she has failed to do so.

15. Second, even if there was a mistake of fact regarding the reasoning for
    the residence order in 2012 I  do  not  accept  that  this  has  caused
    unfairness.  I acknowledge there was limited evidence before the FTT to
    the effect that A1 was experiencing moderate mental health difficulties
    in 2011, which was adversely impacting upon her  parenting  ability  in
    2011 and 2012 - see a letter dated 7 November  2011  from  African  and
    Caribbean Mental Health Services.  This evidence is of limited  utility
    as it predates a risk assessment dated 12 June 2012 (referred to in the
    FTT decision at [20]) in which it was concluded that A1 was not  taking
    treatment and no action was required at time.  I  also  note  that  the
    claim that A1 depended upon B in 2011 and 2012 is inconsistent with the
    evidence in the report dated 22 October 2010 prepared by an independent
    social worker, to the effect that B was in  poor  physical  and  mental
    health, and was therefore dependent upon A1.

16. However, by the time  of  the  hearing  before  the  FTT  there  was  a
    significant change in circumstances.  The FTT made  it  clear  at  [20]
    that although A1 had depression in the past, there was no  up  to  date
    evidence this remained a concern.  When the decision is read as a whole
    it is clear that the FTT did not accept A continued to suffer from  any
    mental  health  concerns.   The  relevance  of  the  reference  to  the
    residence order was simply to underline the point  that  there  was  an
    absence  of  cogent  evidence  to  support  any  claim  that   A1   was
    incapacitated by a mental health condition in the past or at  the  date
    of the hearing.  That finding remains apt notwithstanding the timing of
    any claim for child benefit.

 2) Funding to support the appellants in Nigeria.

17. This ground merely disagrees with the FTT's clear factual finding  that
    the appellants could be financially assisted by B and A1's sister  when
    they initially settle in Nigeria, and would  not  be  without  adequate
    maintenance and accommodation.  This finding was open to the FTT  given
    the following matters, inter alia:  B was retired  but  worked  two  to
    three times a week and did not entirely depend on child benefits; A1 is
    a graduate in architecture  and  has  demonstrated  resourcefulness  to
    equip her to find a job in Nigeria, having worked there in the past.

 3) Reasonableness test

18. Section 117B(6) of 2002 Act states as follows:

         "In the case of a person who is  not  liable  to  deportation,  the
         public interest does not require the person's removal where -

         (a)       the  person  has  a  genuine  and   subsisting   parental
         relationship with a qualifying child; and

         (b)      it would not be reasonable to expect the  child  to  leave
         the United Kingdom."

19. In KO (Nigeria) v SSHD [2018] UKSC 53 the Supreme Court concluded  that
    reasonableness was to be considered in the real world and  as  such  it
    would normally be reasonable for the child to be where the parents were
    expected to be.   To the extent that Elias LJ in MA (Pakistan)  v  SSHD
    [2016] EWCA Civ 705, suggested otherwise, the Supreme Court disagreed.

20. Mrs Sobande's grounds of  appeal  and  skeleton  argument  omitted  any
    reference to KO (Nigeria) and only relied upon MA (Pakistan).   When  I
    invited her to explain how the FTT had erred in law given the  approach
    set out in KO (Nigeria), she was  unable  to  do  anything  other  than
    repeat disagreements with the FTT's findings of fact.  I  am  satisfied
    that the FTT adopted the approach to section  117B(6)  set  out  in  KO
    (Nigeria): the only viable parent of the children has been  in  the  UK
    unlawfully for  many  years;  she  (and  therefore  her  children)  are
    expected to be in Nigeria.  The FTT essentially asked  itself  whether,
    notwithstanding that their best interests support them remaining in the
    UK, it would be reasonable for the children to reside in  Nigeria  with
    their mother.  The FTT has therefore followed the approach  recommended
    in KO (Nigeria), as applied in JG (s 117B(6): "reasonable to leave" UK)
    Turkey [2019] UKUT 72 (IAC).  The FTT has not sought to attribute blame
    or punishment upon the children, but has carefully assessed their  best
    interests in the real world.  The FTT was mindful of the fact that  the
    children would no longer be living with B and  the  impact  this  would
    have on their best interests.  The FTT however found that they each had
    an ordinary grandchild  /  grandparent  relationship  at  [19]  of  its
    decision.  There was no attempt in the written grounds of appeal or the
    oral submissions before me to go behind this factual finding.

Decision

21. The FTT decision does not contain an error of law and is not set aside.
