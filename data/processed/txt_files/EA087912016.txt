                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

       This is an appeal, by the , against the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Sarvanjan Kaler), sitting at  Hendon  on  24  September
    2018, to  an EEA appeal by a citizen of Ghana, born 1957. The appellant
    had been refused a residence card as the wife of a Netherlands citizen.

 2. The  respondent,  and  the  judge  accepted  that  the  sponsor  was  a
    'qualified person' by the date of the hearing, having been  in  regular
    work since March 2018; but the judge took the  view  that  he  had  not
    shown this at the date of the application or the decision, and on  that
    basis dismissed the appeal.

 3. As Miss Everett quite rightly conceded, the law is  set  out  in  Reyes
    (EEA Regs: dependency) [2013] UKUT 314, and  allows  the  appellant  to
    succeed on appeal by establishing the  position  at  the  date  of  the
    hearing on the basis of evidence produced to the tribunal.

 4. In those circumstances the appeal is allowed by consent.
