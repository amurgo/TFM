For the Appellant:     Mr M Jibowu of Solomon & Partners
For the Respondent:    Mr S Walker, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against the decision issued on 14 April 2020 of First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Lucas which refused the appellant's Article 8  ECHR
    appeal against the refusal of leave to  enter  for  settlement  as  the
    spouse a British national.

 2. The appellant is a national of Ghana and was born on 2 February 1964.

 3. The appellant applied  for  entry  clearance  on  14  March  2019.  The
    application was refused on 18 June 2019. The respondent considered that
    the appellant had acted so as to frustrate the Immigration Rules by way
    of her poor immigration history, in particular  overstaying  from  2003
    onwards prior to her voluntary departure for Ghana on 17 October  2018.
    The  appellant  also  had  an  unpaid  litigation  debt  of  ï¿½579.  The
    respondent found these issues  meant  that  paragraph  320(11)  of  the
    Immigration Rules applied and showed that the suitability  criteria  of
    Appendix FM were not met.

 4.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  found  that  the  appellant  had  paid  the
    litigation debt; see paragraph  10  of  the  decision.  The  First-tier
    Tribunal found that paragraph 320 (11) of the Immigration Rules  should
    not have been applied; see paragraph 20. The parties were in  agreement
    that where paragraph 22 of the decision suggested otherwise, this was a
    typographic error.

 5. The appellant maintained that the First-tier Tribunal erred in  finding
    in paragraphs 21 and 23 that "there is no  realistic  Human  Rights  or
    Article 8 claim" given that there was no issue as to the genuineness of
    the  marriage  and  the  First-tier  Tribunal  had  accepted  that  the
    Immigration Rules were met in full.

 6. Before me, Mr Walker conceded for the respondent  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal did err as  set  out  in  the  appellant's  written  and  oral
    grounds. It was not open to the First-tier Tribunal to find that  there
    was "no realistic human rights claim" where  the  appellant  was  in  a
    genuine relationship and, further, had been  found  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal to meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules in full,  an
    important  factor  when  considering   the   proportionality   of   the
    respondent's decision. It was  therefore  conceded  that  the  decision
    disclosed an error on a point of law such that it had to be  set  aside
    and re-made as allowed under Article 8 ECHR.

 7. The Tribunal accepted that the respondent's concession was rational and
    therefore found material error of law, set aside the decision  and  re-
    made the appeal as allowed, it being accepted  that  the  marriage  was
    genuine and that the Immigration Rules had been met in full.

Notice of Decision

 8. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal discloses an error on  a  point
    of law and is set aside to be remade.

 9. The appeal is re-made as allowed under Article 8 ECHR.
