For the Applicant:     Mr T Mahmood (instructed via Direct Public Access)
For the Respondent:    Mr V Mandalia (instructed by the Treasury Solicitor)


                                  JUDGMENT

Judge Grubb:

 1. The applicant seeks a judicial  review  of  the  Secretary  of  State's
    decision of 10  September  2013  to  set  removal  directions  for  the
    applicant's removal to Nigeria following the refusal on 9 May  2013  of
    the applicant's application for leave to remain in the UK as a  Tier  4
    (General) Student Migrant under para 245ZX of the Immigration Rules (HC
    395 as amended) and for a Biometric Residence Permit.

 2. Although the applicant formally challenges the removal directions of 10
    September 2013, it was common  ground  between  the  parties  that  the
    substance of the applicant's challenge was to the refusal on 9 May 2013
    to grant him leave as a Tier 4 (General) Student.

Introduction

 3. The applicant is a Nigerian national who was born on 2 July  1980.   He
    entered the United Kingdom on 28 September 2004 with entry clearance as
    a student valid until 31 October 2007.  Subsequently,  he  was  granted
    further leave as a student until 30 September 2008  and  as  a  Tier  1
    (Post-Study) Student until 9 June 2012.  Further  leave  as  a  Tier  4
    (General) Student  was  granted,  following  reconsideration  after  an
    initial refusal, until 19 April 2013.

 4. The applicant sought further leave as a Tier 4 (General) Student.  What
    precisely happened on or  after  19  April  2013  in  relation  to  his
    application for further leave is the central issue in this  case.   The
    applicant's case is that on 19 April 2013 he made an online application
    for further leave which he submitted to the UKBA.   On  that  date,  he
    paid the requisite fee of �781 via WorldPay and, as he was applying via
    the "premier service "route (to which I shall return shortly), he  made
    an appointment for an interview at the UKBA offices in Sheffield for  a
    few days later on 22 April 2013.

 5. Following that process, on 9 May 2013 the Secretary  of  State  refused
    the applicant's application for further leave as  a  Tier  4  (General)
    Student on  the  basis  that  he  could  not  satisfy  the  maintenance
    requirements in Appendix C of the Rules as  he  could  not  demonstrate
    that he had the required funds of �5,331.50 for 28 days  prior  to  the
    date of his application.  In his own bank account, the applicant  could
    only show �2,877.81 and the applicant could  not  rely  upon  financial
    sponsorship  from  his  uncle  because  the  applicant  had  failed  to
    establish, as required by para 13 of Appendix C, that his uncle was his
    "legal guardian".

 6. In refusing the  applicant's  application,  the  Secretary  of  State's
    decision stated that the applicant had no right of appeal  against  the
    refusal of leave.  This was because his application had been made at  a
    time when he did not have leave to remain as his leave had  expired  on
    19 April 2013 and his application had been made on 22 April 2013. There
    was, consequently, no immigration decision falling within s.82  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (the "2002  Act")  as  the
    Respondent  had  not  made  a  refusal  to  vary,  by  extension,   the
    Applicant's leave (see, s.82(2)(d) of the 2002 Act).  On 16 April  2013
    the Secretary of State affirmed the decision.

 7. On 27 August 2013, the applicant was served with  notice  that  he  was
    liable to removal  as  an  overstayer  and  he  was  detained.   On  10
    September 2013, the applicant was served  with  removal  directions  to
    Nigeria.  On 16 September 2013, the removal directions  were  cancelled
    and the following day, on 17 September 2013, the applicant issued these
    proceedings.  On 2 October 2013, the applicant was granted bail  by  an
    Immigration Judge and released from detention.

 8. On 18 November 2013, the Secretary of State considered the  applicant's
    claim to remain in the UK under Art 8.  In her  decision,  she  refused
    his application and certified the claim as  "clearly  unfounded"  under
    s.94(2) of the 2002 Act.

 9. On 23 April 2014, HHJ Purle QC (sitting as  an  Upper  Tribunal  Judge)
    granted the applicant permission to bring  these  proceedings.   On  16
    June 2014, HHJ Purle QC (sitting as an Upper Tribunal Judge)  dismissed
    an application to set aside or review that decision.

The Issues

10. The applicant's grounds read with Mr Mahmood's skeleton argument  raise
    three issues.

11. First, the applicant argues that he has a right of appeal to the First-
    tier Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) against the decision  to
    refuse him leave on 9 May 2013 because his application  for  leave  was
    made in time on 19 April 2013.

12. Secondly, the applicant argues that the Secretary of State was wrong to
    disregard the evidence of financial sponsorship from his uncle who,  it
    is said, is his legal guardian.

13. Thirdly, the applicant argues that the Secretary  of  State  failed  to
    consider his claim under Art 8 of the ECHR.

Issue 1:  Right of Appeal

14. The applicant's principal argument is that he had a right of appeal  to
    the First-tier Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) (the "FtT") as
    a result of the respondent's decision on  9  May  2013  to  refuse  his
    application for leave to remain.  The basis of that  argument  is  that
    the applicant made an in time application on 19 April 2013 so that  the
    resulting decision taken on 9 May 2013 to refuse him  leave  to  remain
    was an "immigration decision" under s.82(2)(d) of the 2002 Act.  It  is
    accepted that if the applicant did make an in-time  application  on  19
    April 2013, then he has a right of appeal to the FtT

15. The applicant's contention is that he made his application online on 19
    April 2013 rather than on 22 April  2013  when  he  attended  the  UKBA
    offices at Sheffield.

16. Mr Mahmood, on  behalf  of  the  applicant  relied  upon  three  emails
    addressed to the applicant dated 19 April 2013.   The  first  confirmed
    that the applicant had paid the required fee to WorldPay of �781 acting
    on behalf of the UKBA.  The second from the  UKBA  confirmed  that  the
    applicant had completed his application online.  The third confirmed an
    appointment had been made with the UKBA at Sheffield for 22 April 2013.
      Mr  Mahmood  submitted  that  the  applicant  had   "submitted"   his
    application online on 19 April 2013 and by virtue of para  34G  of  the
    Immigration Rules that was the date  upon  which  his  application  was
    made.

17. Mr Mandalia, on behalf of the respondent submitted that  the  applicant
    could not have made an application online on 19 April 2013  as  Tier  4
    (General) Students were unable to do so until  June  2013.   He  relied
    upon a witness statement of Gareth Hunt, a Higher Executive Officer  at
    UK Visas and Immigration based in Sheffield dated 11  August  2014  who
    stated that was the position.  He submitted that  the  emails  did  not
    establish that an application had been "submitted" online.  Rather,  he
    contended that the applicant had completed the form online and made the
    necessary payment as a "print and send" application.   The  application
    was, Mr Mandalia argued, merely held on the website to be  printed  off
    and either sent by post to the UKBA or, as the applicant had chosen  in
    this case to take advantage of the "Premium service", to be taken so as
    to submit the application in person at an interview.

18. Paragraph 34G of the Immigration Rules sets out when an application  is
    "made" and, so far as relevant, provides as follows:

         "For the purposes of these rules, the date on which an  application
         or claim (or a variation in accordance with paragraph 35E is  made,
         is as follows:


         ....


         (ii) where the application form is submitted in person, the date on
             which it is accepted by a public enquiry office of the  United
             Kingdom Border Agency of the Home Office,


         ....


         (iv) where the application  is  made  via  the  online  application
             process, on the  date  on  which  the  online  application  is
             submitted."

19. The applicant's contention is that he submitted the application  online
    and so by virtue of para 34G(iv) the application was made on  19  April
    2013.  The respondent's contention  is  that  the  applicant  made  the
    application in person and, by virtue of para 34G(ii),  the  application
    was made on 22 April 2013.

20.  At  the  outset  of  the  hearing,  I   enquired   of   the   parties'
    representatives whether a copy of the application which  the  applicant
    had undoubtedly made at some point was available.  It was not  included
    in the Tribunal's papers and, it seemed to me, it would be advantageous
    to obtain a copy which might cast some light on the  process  by  which
    the application was submitted and potentially, therefore, the  date  on
    which it was made.  As  a  result  of  my  enquiry,  Mr  Mandalia  made
    enquiries as  to  whether  the  application  form  could  be  obtained.
    Following a  short  adjournment,  Mr  Mandalia  informed  me  that  the
    application was not available for the hearing as it was  archived.   It
    is, perhaps, a matter of some surprise that  the  application  did  not
    form part of the papers available to the Tribunal.  Mr Mahmood told  me
    that the applicant had not kept a copy of the application.  Despite its
    absence, both representatives invited me to continue with  the  hearing
    and neither sought an adjournment in order to obtain  the  application.
    Both invited me to reach a decision on the  basis  of  the  documentary
    evidence and the witness statement of Mr Hunt.

21. In addition, I was only provided with the Home Office guidance entitled
    "Specified application forms and procedures" dated 30 May 2014.  It was
    accepted that this was not the relevant  guidance  in  force  in  April
    2013.  I was,  nevertheless,  shown  it  in  order  to  illustrate  the
    difference between a standard application made by post and  a  "Premium
    application" which required an appointment with the UKBA  following  an
    online application.  It was common ground between the parties that  the
    applicant had, albeit in April 2013,  utilised  the  "Premium"  service
    requiring an appointment with the UKBA.  It was also common ground that
    the applicant had, at least, made that appointment online on  19  April
    2013 with the appointment fixed for 22 April 2013.

22. The crucial issue is, therefore, whether  as  part  of  that  "Premium"
    application process the applicant made the  application  online  on  19
    April 2013 or only when  he  attended  the  appointment  with  UKBA  in
    Sheffield on 22 April 2013.

23. I begin with the evidence relied upon by the applicant.

24. The applicant relies upon three emails.  All three are dated  19  April
    2013 addressed to him and are timed chronologically at 16:44, 16:45 and
    16:47.

25. The first is a  "Transaction  Confirmation"  of  payment  made  by  the
    applicant online for his application.  It states as follows:

         "Your transaction has been processed by WorldPay on  behalf  of  UK
         Border Agency.  We have received your payment of �781.00 for United
         Kingdom Border Agency service  Tier  4  Student  'print  and  send'
         application.  Thank you.

         UKBA reference number PTBA10-2982-1975-24R3

         WorldPay transaction IDL: 2612701000

         Once the UK Border Agency has received your official  document  and
         supporting documents, your application will be complete."

26. The second email is from the UKBA and states as follows:

         "You have completed your application  Tier  4  Student  'print  and
         send' application online.

         You will only  have  access  to  view  or  print  a  copy  of  your
         application from your account for 56 days after the date  shown  in
         your customer account as 'completed online  date'.   Your  official
         document will be permanently deleted at 03.33 AM on Thu 13 Jun 2013
         and you will not be able to view or print it."

27. Finally, a third email also from UKBA confirms an appointment  made  at
    the Sheffield office on 22 April 2013 and is in the following terms:

         "Your appointment details are as follows:
         Booking reference:  13-2-1263703

             will not refund the GBP  100  appointment  fee  per  applicant
             unless there are exceptional circumstances."

28. On behalf of the  respondent,  Mr  Mandalia  relied  upon  the  witness
    statement of Gareth  Hunt  dated  11  August  2014  which,  so  far  as
    relevant, states as follows at paras 3-4:

         "3.  I can confirm that there was not any  method  for  making  any
             online application for leave as a  Tier  4  (General)  Student
             Migrant in place in April 2013.  There was no system in  place
             to accept online applications until June  2013.   It  was  not
             possible for Mr Akande to have made any online application  on
             19.04.13.

         4.   What would have been possible in April 2013 was for Mr  Akande
             to make an online application for an appointment to attend  in
             connection  with  making  a   Premium   service   application.
             However, the application itself could not have been made until
             Mr Akande attended that appointment  and  paid  the  necessary
             fee.   That  would  have  happened  at  his  appointment,   on
             22.04.13."

29. Mr Hunt states at para 1 of his  statement  that  he  is  the  "Premium
    Service Strategy Project  Manager"  at  Sheffield  and  has  held  that
    position since April 2013.  He states that the statement "is made  from
    my own knowledge of the Respondent's Premium service".

30. There is no doubt that the applicant at least filled in an  application
    form online on 19 April 2013.   As  the  second  email  from  the  UKBA
    states, his application was "completed .... online".   Equally,  it  is
    clear that the applicant paid for his application for leave  online  on
    19 April 2013 as the first email from WorldPay makes clear.

31.  The  evidence  of  Mr  Hunt  is,  however,  unequivocal:   an   online
    application could not be made under  the  "Premium  service"  in  April
    2013.  Mr Hunt,  as  he  says  in  his  statement,  holds  a  position,
    coincidentally since April 2013, which would well  place  him  to  know
    whether an online application for Tier 4 student leave could have  been
    made on 19 April 2013.  It is his unequivocal evidence based  upon  his
    own knowledge that it could not be done.

32. Mr Mahmood submitted, in  effect,  that  Mr  Hunt's  evidence  was  not
    reliable since in para 4 it stated that both an application and payment
    of fee could only be made by attending for an appointment at the  UKBA.
    Mr Mahmood submitted that was plainly contrary  to  what  had  actually
    occurred as it was clear from the first email from  WorldPay  that  the
    applicant had been able to pay online.

33. I do not read para 4 of Mr Hunt's witness statement as stating  that  a
    payment could only be made in person in April 2013.  What it  seems  to
    me he is saying in para 4 is that a "premium service"  application  had
    to be made in person and the necessary fee had to be paid.  In my view,
    the final sentence in para 4 is equivocal as  to  whether  or  not  the
    payment could only have been made at the appointment.  Therefore, I see
    nothing inconsistent between Mr Hunt's  evidence  that  an  application
    could not be made online and the first email from  WorldPay  confirming
    that the applicant had paid for an application online.

34. Likewise, the email from the UKBA confirming  that  the  applicant  had
    "completed"  his  application  "online"  does  not  say  that  he   had
    "submitted" that application.  That email is  equally  consistent  with
    the process that Mr Mandalia submitted had taken place  in  this  case,
    namely that the applicant had completed the application online and that
    he then had the choice, using the "standard service" to print and  send
    it to UKBA or, using the "premium service", to print it and take it  to
    an appointment where the application would be "submitted" and therefore
    be "made" by virtue of para 34G of the Immigration Rules.  Indeed, that
    might be the natural  inference  from  the  email's  reference  to  the
    applicant's application being a "print and send" application.  That, in
    my judgment, explains the final paragraph of that email which  confirms
    that the "completed" application can only be viewed and printed out for
    56  days  after  the  date  shown  as  the  "completed  online"   date.
    Thereafter, the application will be permanently deleted.  It  might  be
    thought rather curious that an application would be  deleted  after  56
    days if, in fact, that application had been submitted and  was  pending
    (at least potentially) before the UKBA.  What this paragraph  reflects,
    in my judgment, is that an application "completed" online is  held  and
    available to an individual as a "print and  send"  application  for  56
    days in order that the individual can  print  it  and  either  send  it
    (using the "standard service") or submit it in person at an appointment
    (using the "premium service").

35. The third email confirming the applicant's  appointment  with  UKBA  at
    Sheffield on 22 April 2013 again merely states that the application has
    been "completed" online.  It does not state,  nor  is  it  a  necessary
    inference, that the application has been submitted online.  Indeed, the
    fifth and sixth  bullet  points,  dealing  respectively  with  a  paper
    application form and one completed online, are both consistent with the
    application not being made until the  appointment.   Both  require  the
    individual to bring either the paper form (i.e. one completed by  hand)
    or the online completed form to the  interview.   Clearly,  the  "paper
    form" could not have been submitted until the interview.  Likewise,  in
    my judgment, the requirement to  bring  along  a  printed  copy  of  an
    application completed online is, at the  least,  consistent  with  that
    application having not yet been submitted to the UKBA until the form is
    produced by the individual at the interview.

36. Mr Mahmood placed some reliance upon a letter from the  UKBA  dated  22
    April  2013  which  thanked  the  applicant  for  his  application  and
    requested that he submit detailed bank statements covering the last  28
    days in order that his application could  be  determined.   Mr  Mahmood
    submitted that this letter was in response to an application made three
    days earlier online on 19 April 2013.  I do not accept that submission.
     It seems to me that, as Mr  Mandalia  submitted,  the  timing  of  the
    letter written on the same  day  as  the  applicant's  appointment,  is
    equally consistent with the operation of the premium service which  the
    applicant utilised.

37. It is, perhaps, a matter of some regret that the application  form  was
    not produced in these  proceedings  by  either  the  applicant  or  the
    respondent.  However, as I have already indicated, both representatives
    were  content  that  the  underlying  factual  issue  of   whether   an
    application was made on 19 April  2013  or  22  April  2013  should  be
    decided on the documents and witness  statement  of  Mr  Hunt.   In  my
    judgment, nothing in the email traffic to the  applicant  on  19  April
    2013 persuades me that he "submitted" an application online on 19 April
    2013.  By contrast, the evidence of Gareth Hunt,  who  is  well  placed
    through his personal knowledge to know what processes were in place  in
    April 2013, is clear that an online  application  for  Tier  4  student
    leave could not be made in April 2013 and only became an option in June
    2013.  I accept that evidence.  In  my  judgment,  the  applicant  only
    "completed" his form online on 19  April  2013.   There  is  no  direct
    evidence from the applicant as to what he  then  did.   The  reasonable
    inference is that he printed that application out and took it with  him
    to his appointment with the UKBA on 22 April  2013.   It  was  at  that
    point he "submitted" his application and, by virtue of para 34G(ii), it
    was on that date, namely 22 April 2013 that he made the application for
    Tier 4 leave.

38. Consequently, on the date he made his application the applicant's leave
    had already expired on 19 April  2013.   The  respondent's  refusal  to
    grant him further leave made in her decision on 9  May  2013  was  not,
    therefore, an appealable decision under s.82(2)(d) of the 2002 Act.  It
    was a decision that, as the Secretary of State correctly  notified  the
    applicant, did not attract a right of appeal.

39. For these reasons, I reject this ground.

Issue 2:  Maintenance

40. The requirements for leave to remain as a Tier 4 (Student) Migrant  are
    set out in para 245ZX of the Rules.  So far as relevant to  this  case,
    para 245ZX(d) requires that "the applicant must have a  minimum  of  10
    points under paragraphs 10 to 14 of Appendix C."

41. Paragraph 11 of Appendix C sets out the "maintenance" requirements that
    an individual must meet in order to obtain the necessary 10 points.  It
    is common ground between the parties that the applicant was required to
    show that he had available to him the equivalent  of  �5,331.50  for  a
    period of 28 days between 6 March 2013 and 3 April 2013.   That  figure
    consists of two months' maintenance at �800  per  month  together  with
    outstanding tuition fees.

42. Paragraph 13 of Appendix C sets  out  the  permitted  sources  of  such
    funds.  In addition to the applicant himself, para 13(ii)  permits  the
    funds to be available from:

         "The applicant's parent(s) or legal guardian(s), and the  parent(s)
         or legal guardian(s) have provided written consent that their funds
         may be used by the applicant in order to study in the UK; ..."

43. Paragraph 13B of Appendix C sets out a number of documents  which  must
    be provided where reliance is placed upon sponsorship from a parent or,
    as the applicant claims is relevant in this case, a  "legal  guardian".
    Paragraph 13B, so far as relevant, provides as follows:

         "If the applicant is relying on the provisions in paragraph  13(ii)
         above, he must provide:

         (a)  one of the following original (or notarised  copy)  documents:
             ....

             (ii) his certificate of adoption  showing  the  name  of  both
                  parent(s) or legal guardian, or

             (iii)    a Court document naming his legal guardian; and

         (b)  a letter from his parent(s) or legal guardian confirming:

             (i)  the relationship between the applicant and his  parent(s)
                  or legal guardian, and

             (ii) that the parent(s) or legal guardian give  their  consent
                  to the applicant using their funds to study in the UK."

44.  Although  Mr  Mahmood  initially  submitted  that  the  applicant  had
    submitted sufficient evidence of funds held by his uncle,  who  is  his
    legal guardian, ultimately Mr Mahmood accepted that the  applicant  had
    not submitted with his application, as he was required  by  the  Rules,
    either a "certificate of adoption"  showing  his  uncle  as  his  legal
    guardian or "a Court document" naming his uncle as his legal  guardian.
    In the absence of that  documentation,  the  applicant's  claim  to  be
    entitled to the 10 points under Appendix C for maintenance  was  doomed
    to fail.  It was simply not sufficient  to  produce  his  uncle's  bank
    statements and rely on them unless he could also prove by the  required
    documentation that his uncle was his legal guardian.

45. Consequently, the respondent was entitled (indeed  required  under  the
    Rules) to disregard  the  evidence  of  financial  sponsorship  by  the
    applicant's uncle in the absence of the  required  documentation  under
    para 13B of Appendix C that he was the applicant's legal guardian.

46. For those reasons, I also reject this ground.

Issue 3:  Article 8

47. In relation to this ground, Mr Mahmood both in  his  oral  and  written
    submissions simply submitted that the respondent had failed to consider
    the applicant's Art 8 rights when  refusing  him  leave  as  a  Tier  4
    Student  on  9  May  2013.   However,  in  his  oral   submissions   he
    acknowledged that this was not his main ground of challenge.

48. That was, in my judgment, an entirely realistic stance to  have  taken.
    First, although the  respondent's  decision  of  9  May  2013  made  no
    reference to the applicant's Art 8 rights, her subsequent  decision  of
    18 November 2013 deals at length with the applicant's claim based  upon
    any family and private life in the UK under the Immigration  Rules  and
    Art 8 outside the Rules.  In that latter  decision,  the  Secretary  of
    State went on to certify the applicant's human rights claim as "clearly
    unfounded" under s.94(2) of the 2002 Act.  Mr Mahmood did  not  suggest
    that the respondent's  decision  of  9  May  2013  should  be  read  in
    isolation from her later consideration of Art 8 in her decision  of  18
    November 2013.

49. As regards his claimed family  life,  the  applicant  relied  upon  his
    relationship with his adult siblings in the UK.  The Secretary of State
    entirely correctly concluded that any such relationships could not fall
    within the Immigration Rules, namely Appendix FM.  Mr Mahmood  did  not
    seek to argue to the contrary.

50. As regards the applicant's private life in the  UK,  the  Secretary  of
    State concluded that the applicant could not meet the  requirements  of
    para 276ADE of the Immigration Rules as he had not been resident in the
    UK  for  twenty  continuous  years  (para  276ADE(iii))  and  had   not
    established that he had lost all "ties" with Nigeria (para 276ADE(vi)).
     Those findings were also not challenged by  Mr  Mahmood  in  his  oral
    submissions or skeleton argument.

51. In relation to  Art  8,  the  Secretary  of  State  accepted  that  the
    applicant had established a private life in the UK based upon his  nine
    years' residence.  The Secretary of State noted the applicant's history
    of study on a lawful basis including that he  had  spent  thousands  of
    pounds, had advanced well and was now not able to complete his studies.
     Nevertheless, the Secretary of State concluded  that  the  applicant's
    removal would be proportionate and that there  were  not  "sufficiently
    compelling or compassionate circumstances to warrant permitting you  to
    remain in this country, on a discretionary basis, exceptionally outside
    of the Immigration Rules."

52. The applicant places some reliance on the Court of Appeal's decision in
    OA (Nigeria) v SSHD [2008] EWCA Civ 82.  In that case,  the  individual
    relied upon the disruption to her studies resulting from her removal as
    a basis for her claim under Art 8 of the ECHR.   The  Court  of  Appeal
    held that an Immigration Judge had  been  entitled  to  find  that  her
    removal was a  disproportionate  interference  with  her  private  life
    disrupting, as it did, her study in the UK during her degree course.

53. It is not necessary for me to set out in detail the  reasoning  of  the
    Court of Appeal.  It suffices to say that the circumstances in OA  were
    unusual and compelling.  The individual concerned had been the  subject
    of fraud by  an  immigration  advisor  who  had,  prior  to  her  leave
    expiring, told her that she had been granted indefinite leave to remain
    and had returned her passport complete with the required  stamp.   That
    was fraudulent and the individual concerned was wholly unaware  of  the
    problems with her status.   The  Court  of  Appeal  accepted  that  the
    individual, had she made the necessary  application  to  remain,  would
    almost certainly have succeeded and given the circumstances surrounding
    the fraud by her advisor, it was not  irrational  for  the  Immigration
    Judge to have allowed her appeal under Art 8.

54. The present facts do not bear a true comparison  with  OA.   Here,  the
    applicant simply could not meet the  maintenance  requirements  of  the
    Rules.   There  is  no  comparison  between  this   failure   and   the
    circumstances of the individual in OA.

55. Further, the applicant's claim was, in any event, weak.  In  Patel  and
    Others v SSHD [2013] UKSC 72, Lord Carnwath dealt with the situation of
    an individual who failed to meet the requirements of the student  rules
    and said this at [57]:

         "... such considerations do not by themselves  provide  grounds  of
         appeal under Article 8, which is concerned with private  or  family
         life, not education as  such.   The  opportunity  for  a  promising
         student to complete his course in this country,  however  desirable
         in general terms, is not in itself a right protected under  Article
         8."

56. In my judgment, the Secretary of State was fully entitled  to  conclude
    that the applicant could not succeed under Art  8  of  the  ECHR.   The
    reasoning in her decision letter of 18  November  2013  led  her  to  a
    rational and lawful decision to refuse the applicant's claim to  remain
    in the UK based upon either his family or private life under Art  8  of
    the ECHR.

57. Reading, therefore, the decision letters of 9 May 2013 and 18  November
    2013 together, I reject this ground also.

58. It is, perhaps, unnecessary  for  me  to  deal  with  the  respondent's
    certification of the applicant's claim under Art 8  as  being  "clearly
    unfounded".  As Mr Mandalia submitted, the applicant had not sought  to
    challenge that conclusion.   I  will,  however,  say  a  few  words  in
    relation to that certification.

59. First, the certification would not affect any right of  appeal  against
    the decision of 9 May 2013, if contrary to my conclusion  above,  there
    was an in-country right of appeal.  That is because  the  certification
    under s.94(4) only prevents the bringing of an appeal in-country  where
    the in-country right of appeal is derived from s.92(4)(a) of  the  2002
    Act against an immigration decision because a "human rights  claim  has
    been made.  It does not prevent an appeal  being  brought  against  the
    immigration decisions set out in  s.92(2)  which  includes  s.82(2)(d),
    namely a refusal to vary, by extension, existing leave.

60. Secondly, in any event, given the weakness of  the  applicant's  Art  8
    claim based upon his private life in the UK, I  am  entirely  persuaded
    that it was open to the Secretary of State rationally to conclude  that
    the applicant's Art 8 claim was "clearly unfounded" in the  sense  that
    any appeal relying on Art 8 was "bound to fail" (see R (Thangarasa  and
    Yougathas) v SSHD [2002] UKHL 36.

Decision

61. For the above reasons, this claim for judicial review is dismissed.
