                         DETERMINATIONS AND REASONS

1.    This is an appeal by the claimant from the determination of  Mr  Boyd,
      sitting as an Adjudicator on 29 July 2003.

2.    The claimant is an Algerian who was born on 4 May 1969.    He  entered
      the United Kingdom illegally on 10 June 2000  applying  for  asylum  2
      days later.  He was accompanied by his wife who is a dependant on  his
      claim.

3.    The claimant and his wife come from Oran in the west of Algeria.    He
      began working in a metal school  training  centre  for  trainee  metal
      workers after leaving college.  He was responsible for the maintenance
      of the stores.    This centre was run by a government  agency.   There
      was no requirement to observe Muslim codes of  dress,  men  and  women
      worked together, and traditional  Muslim  customs  were  not  observed
      either.    This caused problems  with  the  GIA.     At  the  training
      school the GIA repeatedly demanded of the  claimant  that  he  provide
      them with materials that could be used for bomb making, but because he
      did not want to help he did not.    The GIA began to  steal  materials
      and petrol bombed the women's centre at the training  school.     This
      was burnt down and the claimant was  accused of committing thefts from
      it.   He was taken to Court but was acquitted in December 1995.

4.    The centre was rebuilt and  security  was  increased  but  the  thefts
      continued and the GIA carried on intimidating employees  and  students
      alike.     He was threatened by telephone and  his  boss  was  killed.
      He transferred to another department in Oran but was  still  contacted
      by the GIA.

5.    In the meantime, on 16 June 1997  he  married.    His  wife  does  not
      adhere to any strict Islamic dress codes and she too  was  threatened,
      indeed her brother was killed shortly after the wedding.

6.    Finally, in March 2000 the GIA attacked his place of  work  and  there
      was a 2 day gun battle.   The claimant says that  he  could  bear  the
      pressure no longer and decided to leave Algeria.

7.    In the initial bundle that was before the Adjudicator were  copies  of
      the claimant's  passport  and  those  of  his  wife.   The  claimant's
      representative before us said that he had not  seen  these  documents,
      but we consider that they were of some assistance in establishing when
      things happened.  We can certainly see no unfairness in  referring  to
      documents that plainly were available to all the  parties  before  the
      Adjudicator as well as before us.  In  any  event  the  study  of  his
      passport has not in any way affected the conclusion to which  we  have
      come in this case.

8.    The claimant's passport shows that  he  applied  for  and  obtained  a
      Schengen visa, which of course gave him admittance to France,  on  the
      19 December 1999, somewhat before the bombing of his  place  of  work.
      However that may be, he did not leave until after that event occurred,
      arriving in Paris airport on 14 April 2000.     He  then  remained  in
      France without ever regularising his position after his  initial  visa
      ran out, but did not apply for asylum there because he was of the view
      that the French authorities were not to be trusted in  their  dealings
      with the GIA, at least to the extent that he would not  be  safe  from
      the GIA if he were to apply for asylum in France.

9.    His wife stayed behind in Algeria, not obtaining a passport  until  23
      January 2000.   She obtained a Schengen visa on  24  August  2000  and
      spent a month in France between 24 September and 22 October.  She then
      returned to Algeria obtaining another visa on  17  March  2001.    She
      then entered France on 29 March 2001 and presumably  met  her  husband
      shortly afterwards.

10.   The claimant and his wife assert  that  if  they  were  to  return  to
      Algeria they would still be at real risk of persecution from the  GIA.



11.   It seems to us that the starting point in assessing risk  must  be  to
      see what the situation in Algeria was  at  the  time  of  the  hearing
      before the Adjudicator in relation to the activities of the GIA.

12.   That is set out at paragraph 6.33 and 6.34 of  the  CIPU  report  that
      was in front of the Adjudicator and which reads as follows:

      "6.33 The violence  [from  the  GIA]  takes  place  primarily  in  the
                 countryside and smaller towns as the security  forces  have
                 largely forced the insurgents out of the cities, except  in
                 the strongholds  of  the  armed  groups.   Cities  such  as
                 Algiers, Oran and  Constantine  are  surrounded  by  police
                 forces.  Terrorist violence has  decreased  enormously  and
                 attacks occur more and more rarely in comparison  with  the
                 difficult years of the 1990s.


        6.34      According to one former policeman  who  contributed  to  a
                 recent country report the backbone of  organised  terrorism
                 has been broken.   The  groups  are  now  fewer  and  worse
                 equipped  than  before.    They  do  not  have   the   same
                 effectiveness  they  once  had.    It  should  normally  be
                 possible to avoid threats by armed  groups  by  the  person
                 concerned going to any of  the  largest  cities  which  are
                 considered as safe."


13.   Despite what the earlier authorities referred to  by  the  Adjudicator
      had concluded in light of the  situation  as  it  appeared  then,  the
      position in Algeria at  the  time  the  hearing  came  on  before  the
      adjudicator was radically transformed, in so far as the  dangers  that
      the GIA and other armed groups were  capable  of  presenting.   It  is
      plain that whatever fears the claimant and his wife may  have  had  of
      the GIA and whatever dangers the GIA posed towards them  in  the  late
      1990s, that  organisation  is  not  capable  of  posing  any  sort  of
      realistic threat to them now.

14.   If they were to go to Algiers, because they felt that Oran was  simply
      too close to home for them to feel safe, there is no  suggestion  that
      they would be at real risk of persecution or Article 3 harm  from  the
      GIA.   This, as it seems to us, would get around any difficulties that
      might be feared, particularly by the claimant's wife, of  any  persons
      known to them in the Oran area.

15.   The Adjudicator came to the conclusion that the claimant could  go  to
      Algiers and indeed it seems the claimant could give no credible reason
      to him why he could not move there and stay there although, no  doubt,
      there would be employment difficulties.

16.   We can see no error in the Adjudicator's conclusions in light  of  the
      background material before  him.   The  issue  as  to  whether,  as  a
      returned failed asylum seeker the claimant would be at risk on  return
      to Algeria was not pursued before  us,  but  in  any  event  we  would
      consider that such a submission would  be  wholly  unarguable  in  the
      present circumstances in that country.

17.   For all these reasons, we consider this appeal must be dismissed.
