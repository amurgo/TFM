                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr D Clarke, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    The Respondent did not attend and was not
represented


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department
    ("the Secretary of State") against the decision of First-Tier  Tribunal
    Judge Chana promulgated on 12 March 2019,  in  which  she  allowed  Mr
    Olmedillo's appeal against the decision of the Secretary of State dated
    17 December 2018 ("the Decision") to remove him from the United Kingdom
    pursuant to the Immigration (European Economic Area)  Regulations  2016
    ("the 2016 Regulations") on the grounds that Mr Olmedillo's removal  is
    required by public policy.

 2. Mr Olmedillo did not attend at the time scheduled for  the  hearing  of
    this appeal, although a Spanish language interpreter  had  been  booked
    for him and was in attendance. We put his case to the back of the  list
    and proceeded with other matters. When  those  were  concluded  and  Mr
    Olmedillo's case was again called on, he  was  still  not  present.  We
    asked the clerk to verify whether he had booked in, and  she  confirmed
    that he had not. We verified that he had been served with notice of the
    date and time of the hearing at his address.  Mr  Clarke,  representing
    the Secretary  of  State,  verified  that,  according  to  Home  Office
    records, his address had not changed, and therefore we had no reason to
    believe that he had not received the notice. There was  no  application
    or correspondence on the file from Mr Olmedillo seeking an adjournment.
    The interpreter was still present and available. We decided that it was
    in the interests of justice to proceed in Mr Olmedillo's  absence,  and
    the interpreter was released.

 3. Mr Olmedillo, a citizen of Spain, was born on 31 May 1988. It  is  not
    certain when he entered the United Kingdom. Being a  European  Economic
    Area national, he would have entered under his right of  free  movement
    within the EEA.

 4. The first official record of Mr Olmedillo's presence in the UK arose as
    a result of his conviction at Lewes Crown Court on 27 March 2015,  when
    he was 26 years of age, of three counts of burglary and  theft  from  a
    dwelling, and two counts of possessing a prohibited weapon  (namely,  a
    weapon for the  discharge  of  noxious  liquid  gas  etc.).  For  these
    offences, he received a two-year community  order  with  a  supervision
    requirement and a requirement to perform 160 hours of unpaid  work.  He
    was also convicted of one count of  possessing  a  controlled  drug  of
    Class B (cannabis/cannabis resin) for which he received a  twelve-month
    conditional discharge. The court also ordered the  destruction  of  the
    drugs and the weapon.

 5. On 9 December 2015 Mr Olmedillo received a caution  from  Essex  Police
    for theft (shoplifting).

 6. On 16 January 2017 at Sussex Central Magistrates' Court,  Mr  Olmedillo
    was convicted of two counts of theft (shoplifting), for  which  he  was
    sentenced to six weeks imprisonment, suspended for 12 months.

 7. On 27 February 2017 at Lewes Crown Court Mr Olmedillo was convicted  of
    failing to comply with the requirements of the community order  he  had
    received on 27 March 2015, as a result of which the community order was
    revoked, and he received a sentence of three  months'  imprisonment  in
    respect of the original offences.

 8. Following this conviction, the Secretary of State sent Mr  Olmedillo  a
    letter dated 28 March 2017 warning him that if he committed any further
    offences, the Secretary of State might seek to deport him.

 9. Notwithstanding that warning, on 14 November 2018 at North West London
    Magistrates'  Court,  Mr  Olmedillo  was  convicted  of   racially   or
    religiously aggravated common assault/assault by beating, for which  he
    received a sentence of 8 weeks' imprisonment.

10. On 27 November 2018 the Secretary of State notified Mr  Olmedillo  that
    he intended to make a deportation  order  against  him  on  grounds  of
    public policy in accordance with regulations 23(6)(b)  and  27  of  the
    2016 Regulations on the  ground  of  public  policy.  In  response,  Mr
    Olmedillo submitted representations dated 28 November 2018. These were
    considered and rejected by the Secretary of State for the reasons given
    in the Decision, which, as we have noted, was dated 17 December  2018.
    On the same day the Secretary of State  made  a  Deportation  Order  in
    respect of Mr Olmedillo, to deport him to Spain, and served it  on  him
    on 18 December 2018. Mr Olmedillo lodged an appeal with the First-tier
    Tribunal against the Deportation Order on the same day.

11. On 21 December 2018, Mr Olmedillo applied for immigration  bail,  which
    was granted on 28 December 2018.

12. On 1 March 2019 Mr Olmedillo's appeal was heard by First-tier Tribunal
    Judge Chana, on which occasion he appeared in person. The Secretary  of
    State was represented by Mr M Grennan.

13. In her judgment promulgated on 12 March 2019,  the  judge  allowed  Mr
    Olmedillo's appeal for, in summary, the following reasons:

        a. "There is no evidence to suggest that  appellant  has  not  been
           exercising his treaty rights in the  United  Kingdom  since  his
           arrival in the country in 2016 [sic]." (para 18 of the judgment)

        b. The Secretary of  State  had  failed  to  put  forward  credible
           evidence that Mr Olmedillo is a threat to the public interest or
           constitutes a present  threat  to  the  requirements  of  public
           policy and public security. He had therefore failed  to  satisfy
           the requirements of regulations 23(6)(b)  and  27  of  the  2016
           Regulations.  (paras 15, 21 and 22 of the judgment)

        c. The Secretary of State's decision to deport Mr Olmedillo:

                  "... was not proportionate on the grounds of public policy
                  and public security as  the  appellant's  criminality  has
                  been low level committed  at  the  age  of  24"  (emphasis
                  added) (para 21 of the judgment)

14. At paras 12 to 13 of the judgment,  the  judge  reviewed  the  evidence
    concerning Mr Olmedillo's employment history in the UK and his  income
    during the period 2016 to 2018. He said that he entered the UK  in  May
    2014, and he accepted during cross-examination that "given his time  in
    prison he has been in this country for four  years  and  five  months".
    When he first arrived in the UK, Mr Olmedillo found a  job  at  a  bar,
    where he worked for seven months, first clearing glasses and then as  a
    bartender, before working in the catering business of  Hilton  for  two
    years. He did various other jobs  at  restaurants  and  then  moved  to
    London to  start  a  business  management  course,  which  he  did  not
    complete. The judge noted Mr  Olmedillo's  explanation  that  "...  the
    reason he burgled [for which he was convicted in 2015] was  because  he
    did not have any money." He also claimed to earn "a little money"  from
    playing music.

15. At para 13, the judge noted the evidence  that  Mr  Olmedillo  paid  no
    income tax in 2016, earned only �368 in 2017 and only �59 in 2018. When
    it was put to Mr Olmedillo during  cross-examination  that  he  was  in
    "marginal employment", he responded that  had  "not  ever  earned  over
    �12,000 which is why his income tax is so low".

16. Relying on this evidence, the judge reached  the  following  conclusion
    regarding  Mr Olmedillo's  exercise  of  his  rights  under  Directive
    2004/38/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council  of  29 April
    2004 ("Treaty rights") (at para 18):

         "18. There is no evidence to suggest that  the  appellant  has  not
             been exercising his treaty rights in the United Kingdom  since
             his arrival in the country in 2016 [sic] even  if  his  income
             was not very high. There is no evidence that  he  has  claimed
             benefits in this country. Therefore, I can only assume that he
             must be looking after himself financially by working."

17. At para 14, the  judge  recorded  Mr  Olmedillo's  evidence  about  his
    offending history as follows:

         "14. The appellant committed a crime and even after a warning given
             to him by the respondent, he ... still flouted  his  community
             order. The appellant's evidence is that he now has a  job  and
             that his boss is supporting him and will  continue  to  employ
             him. The appellant said that he  has  never  been  charged  or
             convicted of any violent behaviour. He said that he is  trying
             to change and that the theft occurred when he was  in  student
             accommodation and stole because he did not have any money  for
             Christmas. He said that he shoplifted a part of sunglasses and
             a T-shirt. He said that he has paid for his mistake and he was
             only 24  years  at  the  time  and  now  he  has  matured  and
             understands the error of his ways. He said that he has done  a
             course  on  anger  management  and  equality   and   diversity
             training."

18. The judge then set out her conclusions as to his offending history  and
    its materiality to the Secretary of State's decision to deport  him  as
    follows (at paras 17, 20 and 21 of the judgment):

         "17. The appellant has only been in this country for four years and
             five months and therefore his deportation should be  justified
             on grounds of public policy, public security or public health.
             I have no reason not to accept his evidence that he has made a
             mistake at the age of 24 because I found the appellant  to  be
             sincere in his remorse and accepted  his  criminality  without
             making  any  excuses.  The  appellant  shoplifted  a  pair  of
             sunglasses and  a  T-shirt  and  failed  to  comply  with  the
             sentence of a community  order  for  which  he  was  sentenced
             again. However, I do not  find  the  criminality  sufficiently
             serious to warrant his deportation as a European Union Citizen
             who has been in this country for nearly 5 years.

         ...

         20.  The appellant's very low sentences reflect the  low  level  of
             his criminality. The appellant has not  continued  to  offend,
             and I accept his evidence that he is trying to put himself  on
             the  straight  and  narrow  path  and  intends  to  work.   It
             particularly resonated with me when he  said  at  the  hearing
             that he knows that if he commits any further crimes,  he  will
             be deported.

         21.  I  find  [that,]  given  the  appellant's  circumstances,  the
             respondent's decision ... is not proportionate on the  grounds
             of public  policy  and  public  security  as  the  appellant's
             criminality has been low level committed at  the  age  of  24.
             There is no credible evidence that the appellant is  a  threat
             to the public interest or constitutes a present threat to  the
             requirements of public policy and public security."

19. The Secretary of State filed an application for  permission  to  appeal
    the judge's decision to the Upper Tribunal on  18 March  2019  on  the
    following grounds (summarised):

      a. The judge failed to give sufficient reasons for  finding  that  the
         Secretary of State had failed to establish that Mr Olmedillo  posed
         a sufficiently serious threat to the  public  interest  or  to  the
         requirements of public policy and public  security,  and  she  also
         made  material  errors  and  findings  that  conflicted  with   the
         evidence.

      b. The judge erred in reversing the burden of proof  by  finding  that
         there was no evidence that Mr  Olmedillo  was  not  exercising  his
         Treaty rights.

20. On 14 May 2019 FTTJ O'Brien granted permission  to  the  Secretary  of
    State to appeal against the judge's decision, on the basis that:

      a. the judge's reasons  for  accepting  that  Mr  Olmedillo  has  been
         exercising Treaty rights in the UK were arguably inadequate  and/or
         resulted from the misapplication of the burden of proof; and

      b. the  judge's  assessment  of  threat  and/or  proportionality  were
         arguably based on a material mistake of fact.

21. We find that the grounds of appeal have been made out, and  that  Judge
    Chana's judgment contains errors of law. We have a number  of  concerns
    about the judge's analysis.

22. In para 1 of her judgment, she states that Mr Olmedillo's date of birth
    is 31 May 1988, which appears to be undisputed. This means that he was
    26 years old at the time of his first conviction  on  three  counts  of
    burglary and theft from a dwelling and two counts of  possession  of  a
    prohibited weapon at Lewes Crown Court on 27 March 2015 and at the time
    of his caution by the Essex Police for shoplifting on 9 December  2015.
    Mr Olmedillo was 28 years old at the time of his subsequent  conviction
    on two counts of shoplifting at Sussex Central  Magistrates'  Court  on
    16 January 2017 and at the time of his conviction on 27 February 2017
    for failing to comply with the 2015 community order. He  was  30  years
    old at the time of his conviction for  racially/religiously  aggravated
    common assault at North West London Magistrates' Court on  14 November
    2018.

23. It appears, however, that despite having, with sufficient accuracy, set
    out his offending history, including the relevant dates, at paras 3  to
    7 of her judgment, the judge appears to rely thereafter on  his  having
    been only 24 years old at the time  of  his  offending  as  a  material
    factor in her assessment of the credibility of the  evidence  presented
    by the Secretary of State to support his deportation decision. At  para
    14 of her judgment, she appears to accept Mr Olmedillo's evidence that:

      a. he has never been charged or convicted of  any  violent  behaviour,
         despite his having been convicted only four months before  the  FTT
         hearing of aggravated common assault; and

      b. he was 24  years  old  at  the  time  of  the  shoplifting  offence
         (relating to the theft of a pair  of  sunglasses  and  a  t-shirt),
         despite his having been 26 years old, if he was  referring  to  the
         shoplifting for which he received a police caution  on  9 December
         2015, or  28  years  old,  if  referring  to  his  convictions  for
         shoplifting on 16 January 2017.

24. Against that background, it is surprising that the judge, at  para  14,
    appears to accept (as is clear  from  para  17)  Mr  Olmedillo's  self-
    serving statement that "now he has matured and understands the error of
    his ways".

25. In the second sentence of para 17 of her  judgment  and  in  the  first
    sentence of para 21, both of which we have set  out  above,  the  judge
    appears to consider that Mr Olmedillo's offending occurred  at  age  24
    and only at age 24, whereas it is clear that his offending  began  when
    he was 26 years old and continued until he was 30 years old.  This,  in
    our view, is a material error.

26. At para 17 of her judgment, where she sets out her principal assessment
    of Mr Olmedillo's criminality, she makes no reference to  his  offences
    of burglary, possession of a prohibited weapon, breach of  a  community
    order and racially/religiously  aggravated  common  assault.  In  other
    words, the judge does not appear to have  addressed  her  mind  in  her
    analysis to his full history of offending, despite having set it out at
    paras 3 to 7 of her judgment.  Her  reasons  for  concluding  that  his
    criminality between 2015  and  2018  is  not  sufficiently  serious  to
    warrant his deportation are therefore inadequate.

27. At para 20, the judge comments that Mr Olmedillo's "very low  sentences
    reflect the low level of his  criminality".  It  does  appear  that  Mr
    Olmedillo has been dealt with surprisingly  leniently  by  the  courts,
    particularly in relation to his offences of burglary and theft  from  a
    dwelling in 2015. That is, as far as it goes, a fair observation. It is
    hard, however, to understand her conclusion that Mr Olmedillo "has  not
    continued to offend", given that his latest conviction  was  only  four
    months prior to the FTT  hearing.  It  "resonated"  with  her  that  he
    acknowledged at the hearing that he was aware that if  he  committed  a
    further offence, he would be deported.  At  para  6  of  her  judgment,
    however, she had noted that he had received such  a  warning  from  the
    Secretary of State (which we note from the documents before us was sent
    on 28 March  2017).  Despite  that  warning,  he  went  on  to  commit
    racially/religiously aggravated common assault.  His  failure  to  heed
    that warning was arguably material to his credibility as to his  desire
    and intention to reform but does not appear to  have  been  taken  into
    account by the judge. It was also relevant that the  latest  conviction
    was one of assault and  therefore  involved  at  least  some  level  of
    violence in spite of Mr Olmedillo's protestations  that  he  had  never
    been  charged  or  convicted  of  any   offence   of   violence.    The
    circumstances of that offence should at the very least have been  taken
    into account  when  considering  whether  Mr  Olmedillo  constituted  a
    present and sufficiently serious threat.

28. At para 18 of her judgment, the judge has wrongly reversed  the  burden
    of proof on the question of whether Mr Olmedillo was exercising  Treaty
    rights in the UK. It was for Mr Olmedillo  to  establish  that  he  was
    exercising Treaty rights. Had she applied the current burden of  proof,
    she may well have reached the  opposite  conclusion  that  he  was  not
    genuinely exercising Treaty rights in light of the evidence set out  at
    paras 12 and 13 of her judgment on his income and  resources.  However,
    this is a weaker ground and we would not have found a material error on
    this point alone.   As  it  is  though,  the  Secretary  of  State  has
    established a clear error on the first ground and therefore the  errors
    combined are material.

  29. In light of the foregoing, we find that the  grounds  of  appeal  have
      been made out.  We are satisfied that the judgment contains errors  of
      law and we set it aside.  We have given careful consideration  to  the
      Joint Practice Statement of the First-tier Tribunal and Upper Tribunal
      concerning the disposal of appeals in this Tribunal.   That  reads  as
      follows:

         "[7.2]   The Upper Tribunal is likely  on  each  such  occasion  to
         proceed to re-make the decision, instead of remitting the  case  to
         the First-tier Tribunal, unless the  Upper  Tribunal  is  satisfied
         that :-

          a) the effect of the error has been to deprive a party before the
             First-tier Tribunal of a fair hearing or other opportunity for
             that party's case to be put to and considered  by  the  First-
             tier Tribunal; or

          b) the nature or extent of any judicial  fact  finding  which  is
             necessary in order for the decision in the appeal  to  be  re-
             made is such that, having regard to the  overriding  objective
             in rule 2, it is appropriate to remit the case to  the  First-
             tier Tribunal."

30. In light of our reasons for finding errors of law, there  has  been  no
    proper determination of the central issues of  fact  and  law  in  this
    case.  The Judge should have but did not  properly  determine  the  two
    central issues whether Mr Olmedillo constitutes a "genuine, present and
    sufficiently serious threat" and whether he is exercising Treaty rights
    in the UK.  For those reasons, we consider it appropriate to remit this
    appeal to the First-tier Tribunal due to the  extent  of  fact  finding
    which is necessary to re-make the decision.

Notice of Decision

We are satisfied  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal's  judgment  does  contain
material errors of law.  We set aside the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal
Judge Chana promulgated on 12 March 2019.  We remit the appeal to the First-
tier Tribunal for re-making before a Judge other than Judge Chana.




Signed   Dated 11 July 2019
