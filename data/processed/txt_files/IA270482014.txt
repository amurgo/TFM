Representation:

For the Appellant: Ms N Hashmi of counsel instructed by Visa Expert
For the Respondent: Mr M Shilliday a Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    1. The appellant is a citizen of India who was born on 8  May  1983.  He
       has been given permission to appeal the determination  of  First-Tier
       Tribunal Judge Fox ("the FTTJ") who dismissed his appeal against  the
       respondent's decision of 9 June 2014 to refuse to grant  him  further
       leave to remain in the UK as a Tier 4 Migrant student. The respondent
       also made a decision to remove the appellant from the UK pursuant  to
       section 47 of the Immigration and Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.


    2. The  respondent  refused  the  application  on  the  basis  that  the
       appellant  did  not  meet  the  maintenance   requirements   of   the
       Immigration Rules. His application was made on 4 April  2014  and  he
       needed to show that he had access to  �1600  for  at  least  28  days
       immediately preceding the date of his application He had not provided
       bank statements dated no more than one month prior to the date of the
       application.


    3. The appellant appealed submitting that the respondent's decision  was
       not in accordance with the Immigration Rules or  in  the  alternative
       that  the  respondent   should   have   exercised   have   discretion
       differently.


    4. The appellant asked that the appeal be determined on the papers which
       is  what  the  FTTJ  did  on  27  August  2014.  He  found  that  the
       "appellant's application is dated 1 April 2014".  The  appellant  had
       failed to demonstrate either possession of �1600 between 4 March 2014
       and 1 April 2014 or, on a more generous interpretation, 3 March  2014
       to 31 March 2014. The appellant had only provided financial  evidence
       covering the period between 31 December 2013 and 1 March 2014.


    5. The FTTJ found that the respondent had not failed to apply her policy
       designed  to  address  minor  deficiencies  in  the  presentation  of
       documents. The appellant had relied on a document which was defective
       in its entirety. The appeal was dismissed.


    6. The appellant applied for permission to appeal which was granted by a
       judge in the First-Tier Tribunal. The grounds submit  that  the  FTTJ
       erred in law by misapplying the  provisions  of  paragraph  1A(h)  of
       Appendix C to the Immigration Rules. The  relevant  portion  provided
       that; "the end of the 90 day period and  28  day  period...  will  be
       taken as the date of the closing balance on the most  recent  of  the
       specified documents and must be no earlier than 31  days  before  the
       date of the application." It is argued that the appellant submitted a
       bank statement with the closing date of 1 March 2014. As the date  of
       application was 1 April 2014  the  appellant  had  submitted  a  bank
       statement with a closing date no earlier than  31  days  before  that
       date. It was clear that the required funds had  been  maintained  for
       that period. The only reason the respondent had  not  considered  the
       appellant's bank statement was because she  had  concluded  that  the
       date of application was 4 April 2014. This was incorrect. The date of
       application  was  1  April  2014.  The  FTTJ  decided  this  in   the
       appellant's favour in paragraph 11 of the determination.


    7. Ms Hashmi submitted that the appellant made an online application  on
       1 April 2014 and that this was the date of application.  One  of  the
       permitted ways of making an application was to do so  online.  Having
       done so he was required to post a paper copy of the application  with
       the accompanying documents and again this is what he did. He received
       an acknowledgement email from the respondent. He  paid  the  required
       fee by credit card on 1 April 2014. The date on the application  form
       was 1 April 2014.


    8. Ms Hashmi argued that the bank statement supplied by the appellant to
       the respondent showed the required amount for the  necessary  period.
       The currency was rupees. At this point Mr Shilliday conceded that  if
       I was against him on the point he was seeking  to  raise  as  to  the
       means by which the application was made and the date  of  application
       then the  bank  statement  did  show  the  required  amount  for  the
       necessary period subject only to converting rupees into sterling  for
       which purpose the application should go back to  the  respondent  for
       further consideration.


    9. Ms Hashmi submitted that the appropriate rate of currency  conversion
       on 1 March 2014 was 103.52 rupees to the pound. This meant  that  the
       minimum balance equated to �10,016.40, well in excess  of  the  �1600
       required. She asked me to find that the FTTJ  erred  in  law  in  his
       application of the requirements of the Rules to the  evidence  before
       him. I was asked to set aside the decision and re-make  it,  allowing
       the appellant's appeal on the basis of the evidence before the FTTJ.


   10. Mr Shilliday submitted that the date of application was 4 April 2014.
       This was what was said in the refusal decision of  9  June  2014.  He
       produced and took me  to  the  Home  Office  guidance  on  "specified
       application  forms  and  procedures"  and  relied  on  this  for  the
       submission that, under paragraph 34G(i) of the Immigration Rules, the
       date of posting was to be treated as the  date  of  application.  The
       Royal  Mail  "SD1"  postage  paid  stamp  reproduced  at  E1  of  the
       respondent's bundle showed that the application form had been  posted
       on 4 April 2014. It was not accepted that  an  application  had  been
       made online, although he did accept that the email  produced  by  the
       appellant had been sent to him by UK Visas and Immigration.


   11. I find no merit in these submissions. Whilst the refusal letter  does
       state that the application was made on 4 April 2014  no  reasons  are
       given for this conclusion. In paragraph 5 the  FTTJ  found  that  the
       application was dated 1 April 2014. There is no cross-appeal  by  the
       respondent challenging this. However, even if this is not  sufficient
       to dispose of the point as to the date of application I find that the
       respondent has not established that the date was 4 April 2014.


   12. Paragraph 34G in Part 1 of the Immigration Rules provide;


          34G. For the purposes  of  these  rules,  the  date  on  which  an
          application or claim (or a variation in accordance with  paragraph
          34E) is made is as follows:
             (i)  where the application form is sent by post, the  date  of
                 posting,
             (ii) where the application form is submitted  in  person,  the
                 date on which it is  accepted  by  a  Home  Office  premium
                 service centre,
             (iii)         where the application form is sent  by  courier,
                 the date on which it is delivered to the Home Office, or
             (iv) where the application is made via the online  application
                 process, on the date on which  the  online  application  is
                 submitted.


   13. If all that the appellant did was to send  his  application  by  post
       then I agree that under 34G(i) the application would be made  on  the
       date of posting. However, if the application was  made  online  under
       34G(iv) then the application would be made on the date on  which  the
       online application was submitted.


   14. The respondent submits that the application was made only by post and
       that the Royal Mail "SD1" postage paid stamp reproduced at E1 of  the
       respondent's bundle showed that it was posted on 4  April  2014.  The
       appellant submits that the application was made online and that  once
       this had been done Home Office procedures required him to  print  off
       the completed application  form  and  submit  it  by  post  with  any
       accompanying documents  on  which  he  relied.  The  existence  of  a
       procedure in this form is borne out by the Home  Office  guidance  to
       which I have referred. This indicates that an applicant can apply and
       pay their application fee online "using the  "print  and  send"  form
       before they print off the completed application form and send  it  to
       the Home Office with their supporting documents. There is support for
       the appellant's contention that he followed  this  procedure  in  the
       email sent to him from UK Visas and Immigration dated  1  April  2014
       which states; "you have completed your  application  Tier  4  Student
       "print and send" application online".


   15. I find that the appellant has established, to  the  standard  of  the
       balance of probabilities, that he made an  online  application  on  1
       April 2014, in a manner acceptable to and accepted by the  respondent
       and that this should be treated as the date of his application.


   16. On behalf of the respondent Mr Shilliday conceded that if  I  reached
       this conclusion as to the date  of  the  application  then  the  bank
       statement did show the required amount for the necessary  period.  He
       added the rider that this  was  subject  to  converting  rupees  into
       sterling for which purpose the application  should  go  back  to  the
       respondent for  further  consideration.  I  find  that  this  is  not
       necessary. I agree with Ms Hashmi and find that the appropriate  rate
       of currency conversion on 1 March  2014  was  103.52  rupees  to  the
       pound. This means that the minimum  balance  equated  to  �10,016.40,
       well in excess of the �1600 required.


   17. Albeit that this was entirely understandable in view of  the  absence
       of any assistance by way of submissions I find that the FTTJ erred in
       law. The evidence before him did not support the conclusion that  the
       relevant period for the bank statements was either 4 March 2014 to  1
       April 2014 or 3 March  2014  to  31  March  2014.  I  set  aside  the
       decision. I find that the date of application was  1  April  2014.  I
       find that  applying  the  appropriate  rate  of  currency  conversion
       combined with the concession made by Mr Shilliday the  appellant  has
       established that he meets the requirements of the Immigration Rules


   18. I have not been asked to make an anonymity direction and can  see  no
       good reason to do so.


   19. I remake the decision and allow  the  appellant's  appeal  under  the
       Immigration Rules.
