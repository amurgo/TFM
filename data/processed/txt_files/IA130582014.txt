                                     and

                 Secretary of State for the Home Department

                                                                  Respondent


                            NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL

 1. The Appellant is a national of Bangladesh date  of  birth  5th  January
    1989.


 2. On the 13th April 2015 Upper Tribunal Judge Gill granted permission  to
    appeal to the Upper Tribunal on the grounds that it was  arguable  that
    the First-tier Tribunal had failed to have regard to the authorities in
    Patel (revocation of sponsor's licence - fairness)  India  [2011]  UKUT
    211 (IAC) and Thakur (PBS decision - common law fairness) India  [2011]
    UKUT 151 (IAC). The short point was that the  Appellant  had  not  been
    given an opportunity to find a new Tier 4 sponsor and course.

 3. That issue has now been resolved. I am informed by way of letter  dated
    29th October 2015 from Malik  Law  Chambers  that  the  Respondent  has
    withdrawn her decision and has  granted  the  Appellant  his  '60  days
    letter' in order to give  him  an  opportunity  to  vary  his  original
    application.   The Appellant accordingly wishes to withdraw his  appeal
    before the Upper Tribunal and in accordance  with  Rule  17(2)  of  the
    Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 I give him permission to
    do so.
