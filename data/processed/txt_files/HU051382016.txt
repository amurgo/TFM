Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appellant's appeal against the decision  of  Judge  Dearden
    made following a hearing at Bradford on 19th July 2017.

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Gambia born in 1966.  He applied to  come
    to the UK to join his wife and children here but  was  refused  on  8th
    January 2016 on the grounds that he had previously used false documents
    to enter the UK and had contrived in a significant way to frustrate the
    intentions of the Immigration Rules by overstaying, using deception and
    multiple identities, and making frivolous applications.

 3. The Immigration Judge recorded that the appellant came to the UK  as  a
    visitor in August 2000 and then overstayed his visa, remaining  without
    leave until 15th August 2005.  He made two unsuccessful applications to
    remain following which he attempted,  on  two  separate  occasions,  in
    2005, to re-enter the UK using false documents.  In March 2007 he again
    attempted to re-enter using a false Gambian passport and  in  the  same
    month was removed from the UK.  Since then he has been in the Gambia.

 4. When he made the present application he failed to  disclose  the  three
    occasions of attempted entry, filing  a  statement  before  the  judge,
    apologising for his dishonesty.

 5. The judge recorded that Mrs [S] lives with her four children, aged  24,
    23, 17 and 11, and she has two jobs.  She works as a packer in a  fruit
    factory and additionally has a cleaning job bringing her  total  income
    to approximately ï¿½24,000 per year.  Two of  the  children  are  British
    citizens.

 6. The judge stated that Section 15 of the 2014  Immigration  Act  reduced
    the rights of appeal available in Section 82 of the 2002 Act  and  said
    that the starting point for the decision in relation  to  human  rights
    was whether the appellant had  the  ability  to  meet  the  Immigration
    Rules.  He recorded the  representative's  submissions,  accepted  that
    there was family life in this case and wrote as follows:

         "One of the factors which is very important  in  assessing  whether
         the Article 8 appeal should be allowed outside the  Rules,  is  the
         fact that the appellant cannot comply with the  Immigration  Rules,
         for reasons previously stated.  It is only a small number of  cases
         of a compelling nature which can  succeed  under  Article  8  which
         cannot  succeed  under  the  Rules.   The  appellant's  immigration
         history is abysmal and whilst any  father  wants  to  be  with  his
         children, I cannot  identify  any  compelling  circumstances  which
         warrant this appeal being allowed outside the Rules.  The appellant
         is the author of his own misfortune".

 7. On that basis he dismissed the appeal.

 8. The appellant sought permission to appeal on the grounds that the judge
    had erred in law in his assessment of Article 8.

 9. On 23rd October 2017 Judge Bird granted  permission  stating  that  the
    judge had arguably not properly carried out a  balancing  exercise  and
    had failed to apply  and  consider  the  Supreme  Court's  decision  in
    Agyarko and Others [2017] UKSC 11.

Submissions

10. Mrs Pettersen submitted that, whilst the Entry  Clearance  Officer  may
    have been wrong to refuse  the  application  under  paragraph  320(11),
    given that it has been over ten years since the appellant was  removed,
    because he had not come to  the  Tribunal  with  clean  hands,  in  not
    disclosing the previous deceit, the judge was  entitled  to  reach  the
    conclusion which he did.  She accepted that the judge had not  properly
    reflected the law when he referred to only a small number of compelling
    cases which could succeed under Article 8, and that,  had  he  directed
    himself differently, he might  have  reached  a  different  conclusion.
    Nevertheless, she submitted that the decision was sustainable.

Consideration of whether there is a Material Error of Law

11. I disagree with Mrs Pettersen's submissions.

12. There is no reference in this determination to the considerable factors
    in the appellant's favour when assessing  the  proportionality  of  the
    Entry Clearance Officer's decision, namely the very lengthy  separation
    which he has had from his family, and the best interests of  the  minor
    children who have been without their father for ten years.  The Supreme
    Court  in  Agyarko  has  made  it  clear  that  there  is  no  test  of
    exceptionality as such, and that the task of the decision-maker  is  to
    determine a fair balance between the public interest and the individual
    interest of those involved.  It is not apparent that this is  what  the
    judge has done.  Moreover, in referring to a small number of cases of a
    compelling nature which could  succeed  under  Article  8  he  did  not
    properly reflect his duty to apply the test of proportionality.

13. The decision of the judge is set aside.

14. Since the sponsor was present it was possible  to  hear  oral  evidence
    from her and to re-make the decision.

15. The sponsor told me that she has been with her husband since 1993.  She
    speaks to him every day, as do the children.  Her  youngest  child  has
    just started secondary school and her second youngest  is  studying  in
    college.  She found it very difficult managing without him, bringing up
    the children and holding down two jobs.  She did visit him in 2016  but
    apart from that has not seen her husband since March 2007.

Further Submissions

16. Mrs Pettersen acknowledged that there may have been  financial  reasons
    why the sponsor has only visited the Gambia  once.   Nevertheless,  she
    submitted that there was no reason why  she  herself  should  not  move
    there.  In any event, the children have been without their father for a
    good many years and family life could continue as it had  done  through
    the daily telephone calls.  The appellant's efforts to  return  the  UK
    had been undermined by his failure to set out his full history.

17.  Mr  Hussain  asked  me  to  allow  the  appeal  submitting  that   the
    proportionality balance was  clearly  in  his  favour  given  the  very
    lengthy absence from the UK and its effect on the children.

Findings and Conclusions

18. The appellant had a very poor immigration  history  until  his  removal
    from the UK in 2007.  He then compounded matters by failing to disclose
    his previous deception in the present application.  I have a  statement
    from him apologising for his dishonesty  and  explaining  that  he  was
    desperate because his wife and children were in the UK.

19. Clearly the appellant's past conduct and his present errors are  strong
    evidence in the respondent's  favour  in  arguing  that  his  continued
    exclusion from the UK is proportionate.

20. However, against that, is the evidence of the clear adverse  effect  of
    his absence on the two minor children who are  both  British  citizens.
    The sponsor's evidence was not questioned by Mrs Pettersen who did  not
    seek to make any attack upon her  credibility.   The  strength  of  the
    family life here is not disputed.

21. I accept that the children speak to their father  every  day.   I  also
    accept the evidence in their letters that they miss him very  much  and
    want him to be part of their lives on a daily basis.  The  older  child
    also states how difficult it has been for his mother  and  indeed  that
    was very apparent at the hearing.  She  has  held  down  two  jobs  and
    brought up the children alone.  That is a considerable achievement  and
    it has taken its toll.

22. The best interests of the children are clearly to be with their father,
    not only because of their relationship with him, but also  because  his
    presence will substantially mitigate the strains upon his wife.

23.  I  accept  the  appellant's  apology  and  his  explanation  that  his
    motivation has always been just to be with his family.  That is not  to
    excuse his deceit but it does explain his motivation.

24. He has been out of the UK for eleven years.  Had he been the subject of
    a deportation order he would now be in a position to apply for it to be
    revoked.  Although Mrs Pettersen submitted that he could  make  another
    application, given  the  very  lengthy  separation  which  has  already
    occurred,  this  would  not  be  a  proportionate  response  in   these
    circumstances.

25. My starting point is whether the appellant meets  the  requirements  of
    the relevant Immigration Rules.

26. The appellant meets  the  substantive  requirements  of  the  Rules  in
    relation to spouses, there being no challenge  to  the  subsistence  of
    this marriage or  to  the  sponsor's  ability  to  meet  the  financial
    requirements  of  the  Rules.     Whilst   the   appellant's   previous
    immigration history would have justified a refusal of  entry  clearance
    under paragraph 320(11) in the past, there  comes  a  point  when  past
    mistakes are outweighed by other factors.  Of course in this  case  the
    appellant made a further mistake in not  disclosing  his  history,  but
    that in itself is not sufficient to outweigh the other factors  in  his
    favour.

27. It would not be reasonable to expect the two British children, both  of
    whom have never been to Gambia and who are at  an  important  stage  in
    their education in the UK, to go and ive there. They enjoy family  life
    with their brothers who live in the  same  household,  which  would  be
    severed if half of them lived in Gambia.



Notice of Decision

28. The original judge erred in law.  His decision is set aside.  It is re-
