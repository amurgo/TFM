Representation:
For the Appellant:     Not represented at hearing
For the Respondent:    Mr Avery (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, born December 26, 1987, is a citizen  of  Pakistan.  The
    appellant entered the United Kingdom as a student in February 2011 with
    a visa valid until November 30, 2013. On November 29, 2013  he  applied
    for a residence card to remain as the extended family member of Suleman
    Butt who is either his cousin or uncle depending on which part  of  his
    evidence is correct. The respondent refused this application.

 2. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal under  Section  82(1)
    of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and  Regulation  26
    of  the  Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations  2006  on
    February 19, 2014 and on July 1, 2014 Judge of the First Tier  Tribunal
    Devittie (hereinafter referred to as the "FtTJ") heard his  appeal  and
    in determination promulgated on July 29,  2014  he  refused  his  claim
    under the EEA Regulations,  the  Immigration  Rules  and  human  rights
    grounds.

 3. The appellant lodged grounds of  appeal  on  August  12,  2014  and  on
    September 30,  2014  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  McDade  gave
    permission to appeal on the basis the FtTJ may have  erred  by  finding
    the appellant was not related as claimed because the refusal letter did
    not make such an assertion.

 4. By midday today there was no attendance by either the appellant or  his
    representatives. Neither  the  appellant  nor  his  family  member  had
    attended the original hearing before the FtTJ and it does not appear he
    was represented  on  that  occasion  either.  My  clerk  contacted  the
    solicitors who indicated that a letter had been  sent  on  November  3,
    2014 inviting the Tribunal to deal with the appeal  on  the  papers.  A
    copy of that letter was requested and placed on the court file.

 5. In those circumstances I proceeded with  the  hearing  and  invited  Mr
    Avery to make his submissions on the error in law.

    SUBMISSIONS ON ERROR OF LAW

 6. The grounds of appeal took issue with the following matters:

      a. The FtTJ was wrong to find the appellant was not related as claimed
         because this was not a matter taken up in the refusal letter or  at
         the hearing when it seems nether party was represented.


      b. The FtTJ was wrong to find the sponsor was not living in the United
         Kingdom and exercising treaty rights.


      c. The FtTJ was wrong to find the appellant's fees had not been met by
         the sponsor as evidence of remittances was before the Tribunal.


      d. The article  8  outcome  would  have  been  different  if  positive
         findings on the above had been made.


 7. Mr Avery submitted:


      a.  Judge of the First-tier Tribunal McDade  appeared  to  have  given
         permission based on the finding that the appellant was not  related
         as claimed. He accepted the refusal  letter  did  not  specifically
         challenge the relationship but submitted either the letter did  not
         accept  the  relationship  or  alternatively  this  error  was  not
         material because of the other adverse findings.


      b. The sponsor's own evidence was that he earned �3,205 for the twelve
         months to March 2014. There was a lack of evidence submitted  about
         other income from previous years but if he only earned that  amount
         then his claim that he financially supported the  appellant  lacked
         credibility and the FtTJ was  entitled  to  make  that  finding  in
         paragraph [7(iii)] of his determination.


      c. The FtTJ was also entitled to make the other findings in  paragraph
         [7] as he was provided with a  lack  of  evidence  to  support  the
         claims and neither the appellant nor sponsor attended to answer any
         questions the FtTJ may have had about the documentation.


      d. As the appellant  claimed  he  was  financially  dependant  on  the
         sponsor then the fact the  sponsor  only  claimed  to  earn  �3,205
         undermined this claim and the appellant had failed  to  demonstrate
         anything other than mere emotional ties.


 8. Having heard Mr Avery's submissions I reserved my decision.

    ASSESMENT OF ERROR OF LAW

 9. Grounds of appeal were submitted  and  when  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal McDade considered the application he notably stated  the  only
    possible  error  was  the  finding  about   there   being   no   family
    relationship. Paragraph [3] of the permission states, "It appears  that
    in paragraph [11] of the judge's determination he went beyond what  the
    respondent  had  apparently  already  accepted,   namely   the   family
    relationship between the parties, and as  such  there  is  an  arguable
    error in law".

10. The grounds of  appeal  raised  other  grounds  as  set  out  above  in
    paragraph [6] but none of these other grounds  were  mentioned  in  the
    grant of permission.

11. I have considered the other grounds  and  I  am  satisfied  the  FtTJ's
    findings on those other issues were open to him. In  particular,  great
    weight  was  placed  on  the  appellant's  financial  reliance  on  his
    cousin/uncle but no  evidence  relating  to  the  payment  of  fees  or
    maintenance was  provided.  Of  even  more  concern  is  the  fact  the
    sponsor's own accountant indicated his  only  income  was  as  a  self-
    employed taxi driver and his gross income was �9,810 and his net profit
    was �3,205. The letter confirmed that the sponsor had no other  income.
    This profit figure amounted to �61 per week. The FtTJ was  entitled  to
    make the findings he did about income and he was entitled to  find  the
    appellant was not financially dependent on his uncle/cousin.

12. The FtTJ noted that little financial evidence  was  produced  with  the
    application itself but that in itself is not a  reason  to  refuse  the
    application. The FtTJ considered all of the evidence including a letter
    from HM Revenue and Customs that suggested he received no  income  from
    his self-employment in the year ending April 2012. Bearing in mind  the
    appellant claimed to have been supported before  he  arrived  here  and
    since he has been here, the FtTJ was entitled to have the  concerns  he
    did.

13. The FtTJ made findings that were open to him and it therefore comes  as
    no surprise that Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  McDade  did  not
    highlight any error in these other areas.

14. I accept the respondent did not raise relationship as an issue  but  if
    there is an error this is not based on the FtTJ's other findings.

15. I note the appellant has claimed his sponsor is his uncle  or  possibly
    his first cousin. There is a discrepancy and there may be  an  innocent
    explanation for this. I could not take this issue any  further  because
    the  appellant  did  not  attend  the  hearing  having  instructed  his
    solicitors to infirm the Tribunal he wanted his appeal decided  on  the
    papers.  Regardless of this point I am  satisfied  any  possible  error
    about the relationship is not material to the EEA consideration for the
    reasons set out above.

16. Judge of the First-tier Tribunal McDade did not suggest  there  was  an
    error in law with regard to any article 8 assessment. The appellant did
    not meet Appendix FM or paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration Rules. Even
    if I accept he was related  there  is  no  evidence  of  any  financial
    dependency based on the FtTJ's findings which I  have  upheld.  He  may
    live with the sponsor but it is unclear who actually pays the rent. The
    rent is �850 per month and as the sponsor only earned �61 per  week  no
    satisfactory explanation was provided as to how the rent was paid.  The
    appellant has only been in the United Kingdom for  a  short  period  of
    time and during that time he claimed to have been studying. Mere  study
    cannot raise article 8 ECHR. The FtTJ found at paragraph  [11]  of  his
    determination there as no family or private life. Even if he was  wrong
    about the appellant and sponsor being related the appellant has to show
    more, as an adult, than a mere family relationship.

17. There is nothing exceptional or compelling about the facts of this case
    that would make removal unjustifiably harsh. The appellant and  sponsor
    did not attend the hearing (original or today's) and his  evidence  and
    claim was rejected.

18. I am satisfied the FtTJ considered article 8 within the Rules and there
    was no necessity to consider the application outside of  the  Rules  in
    light of the negative findings made as there was nothing exceptional or
    compelling that would make his removal unjustifiably harsh.




    DECISION


19. There was no material error of law. I uphold the original decision  and
    dismiss the appeal before me.

20. Under Rule 14(1) The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (as
    amended) the  appellant  can  be  granted  anonymity  throughout  these
    proceedings, unless and until a tribunal or court directs otherwise. No
    order was made in the First-tier Tribunal and I see no reason to  amend
    that Order now.
