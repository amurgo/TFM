                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Anonymity Direction

In  order  to  secure  the  anonymity  of  the  appellant  throughout  these
proceedings  I  direct  pursuant  to  Rule  45(4)(i)  of  the   Asylum   and
Immigration  Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules  2005  that  no  report  or  other
publication of these proceedings or of any part or parts of them shall  name
or  directly  or  indirectly  identify  the  appellant.   Reference  to  the
appellant may be by use of his or her initials but not by name.  Failure  by
any person, body or institution whether corporate or  incorporate  [for  the
avoidance of doubt to include either party to this appeal]  to  comply  with
this direction may lead  to  a  contempt  of  court.   The  direction  shall
continue in force until this  Tribunal,  the  Upper  Tribunal  (IAC)  or  an
appropriate court shall list  or  vary  it.   This  direction  is  in  place
because it affects a minor.

The Appellant

 1. The appellant is a citizen of the Philippines born 24th August 1972 and
    she appealed against a decision made by the Secretary of State on  23rd
    October 2013 to refuse to vary  her  leave  to  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom and to remove her by way of directions under Section 47 of  the
    immigration and Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.  The appellant  worked
    as a nanny for employers and she cared for a profoundly deaf child aged
    3 � years old. On 3rd July 2014 First Tier Tribunal  Judge  Scott-Baker
    dismissed her appeal finding that Section 55 of the Borders Citizenship
    and Immigration Act 2009 did not apply to the child she  cared  for  as
    the decision was not within the Immigration context.   An error of  law
    was found in Judge Scott-Baker's decision as she did not factor  in  an
    adequate analysis of the child's interests or  make  adequate  findings
    thereon.  Although the Judge did consider the  best  interests  of  the
    child she did not factor in the  specialist  report  of  Dirk  Flowers,
    dated 22nd May 2014, an educational psychologist or assess  the  degree
    of  the  private  life  formed  in  conjunction  with  the  appellant's
    presence. In my error of law decision I preserved the findings of Judge
    Scott-Baker.

 2. I carefully considered the submissions made by the parties  in  respect
    of the appellant and with particular reference to  Section  55  of  the
    Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 which confirms  that  the
    Secretary of State

    "55: Duty regarding the welfare of children


         (1) The Secretary of State must  make  arrangements  for  ensuring
    that -


             (a)  the functions mentioned in subsection (2) are  discharged
                  having regard to the need to  safeguard  and  promote  the
                  welfare of children who are in the United Kingdom, and


             (b)  any services  provided  by  another  person  pursuant  to
                  arrangements which are made by the Secretary of State  and
                  relate  to  the  discharge  of  a  function  mentioned  in
                  subsection (2) are provided having regard to that need;


         (2)  The functions referred to in subsection (1) are-

             (a)  any function of the Secretary of  State  in  relation  to
                  immigration, asylum or nationality;


 3. I find that the decision is within an immigration context  and  clearly
    the removal of the appellant will have an impact on  the  child  L.   I
    accept that the appellant does not have a residence order  in  relation
    to the appellant or a contact order and her  relationship  is  that  of
    employee to the family.  There is no  biological  relationship  between
    the appellant and L but nonetheless there may be an  'enhanced  private
    life' of the child with respect to his relationship with the  appellant
    and further to Beoku-Betts v SSHD [2008] UKHL 39 her removal would have
    an impact on the child.  I must take into account his human rights.   I
    have considered L's best interests in line with Zoumbas v  SSHD  [2013]
    UKSC 74.  Mr Nathan pointed out that no other  consideration  could  be
    treated as inherently more significant and that  it  was  important  to
    have a clear idea of a child's circumstances before  one  asks  whether
    those interests are outweighed by other considerations.

 4. L is a child of 3 years and 7 months who three months after he was born
    was diagnosed with profound hearing loss and the appellant was employed
    when he was 4 months old.  She understands his needs  and  is  able  to
    appropriately encourage and facilitate his attempts  at  communicating.
    I have  no  doubt  that  she  has  had  a  longstanding  and  excellent
    therapeutic relationship  with  L  which  Mr  Flower,  the  educational
    psychologist,  identified.   The  appellant  also  spends  considerable
    amounts of time working with him on the therapeutic programme.

 5. I therefore accept that there is  a  strong  bond  between  L  and  the
    appellant such that she is part of his private life and the appellant's
    removal may have consequences of such gravity as to  engage  Article  8
    following the principles in Razgar [2004] UKHL 27.

 6. I find that the decision is in accordance  with  the  law.   There  was
    limited information placed before the Secretary of State in relation to
    L and the bulk of the information was indeed presented  to  the  First-
    tier Tribunal rather than the Secretary  of  State.   I   note  JO  and
    Others (section 55 duty) Nigeria [2014] UKUT 00517 (IAC), applies but I
    find the Secretary of State did consider the interests  of  L  and  the
    relevant factors as presented to her, and these are referred to in  the
    Secretary  of  State's  refusal  letter  of  23rd  October  2013.   The
    substance of consideration is present in that refusal as it is noted  L
    is profoundly deaf, that the appellant played an important role in  his
    habilitation and development but that he had the support of his parents
    and official agencies and it was not accepted that  there  would  be  a
    detrimental effect in his development on the appellant's return to  the
    Philippines.

 7. I turn to the question of proportionality.  L's best  interests  are  a
    primary consideration but not necessarily the primary consideration.

 8. First and foremost he is living at home with his parents both  of  whom
    confirm that they have changed their  working  patterns  and  are  both
    centred at home and the evidence given by the mother was  that  one  of
    the parents could always collect him from school.  Indeed L  attends  a
    mainstream nursery school and further to the evidence of the father has
    done so for a  year.   Both  the  appellant  and  Mrs  D,  the  mother,
    confirmed that L attended nursery school  from  approximately  9:00  to
    9:45 in the morning to 4:00 o'clock onwards in the afternoon  on  three
    days a week and also on Tuesday morning.  Mrs D also confirmed  that  L
    has his own dedicated learning support assistant.

 9. I accept Mr  Flower's  opinion  that  the  disruption  of  the  therapy
    programme should be kept to the minimum during the next few  years  "as
    changes in significant members of the therapy team is likely to  reduce
    delay or possibly regress L's current levels of excellent  progress  by
    up to six months" but owing to the reasoning  given  below  (not  least
    that Mr Flower did not make reference to  the  full  facts)  I  do  not
    accept that the departure of the appellant would  cause  a  significant
    disruption.

10. Judge Scott-Baker recorded the following at [21] and I take  this  into
    account

         'At the reconvened hearing there was before me  a  report  from  Mr
         Flower, chartered psychologist, dated 22 May  2014.   He  confirmed
         that L was now 3 years  of  age  and  that  approximately  eighteen
         months ago he had received bilateral cochlear implants  and  before
         this he had been a non-speaker.  He was  now  able  to  communicate
         using three to four  words  and  sentences  but  there  were  still
         difficulties in the amount of verbal communication and the  clarity
         of vocalisation.  Many who did not know him would  have  difficulty
         in understanding what he was saying to them.  He had  observed  the
         appellant and L together and noted that she was fully aware of  his
         communicative needs and attempts to  verbally  interact  with  her.
         The appellant had learned many strategies in providing  appropriate
         incidental learning and therapeutic  responses  and  she  generally
         understood the appellant's attempts at communication.  Both parents
         and his current speech language therapist Ms M of [the  speech  and
         language centre] considered that the appellant was  a  very  valued
         key member of the therapy team.  She had developed  her  skills  at
         the  same  time  as  L  had  developed  so  that  his  needs   were
         consistently  and  appropriately  being  met.   The  parents   also
         considered  that  she  had  similar  abilities  to  themselves   in
         extending  L's  understanding  and  verbal  language  communication
         skills.  With themselves they view the appellant as  being  one  of
         the three key members of the day-to-day therapy providers.  Over  a
         week the appellant would spend over  40  hours  with  L.   She  had
         attended over 100 hours of speech  language  therapy  with  various
         therapists and had learnt many of the recommended strategies.  They
         hoped to take her to Los Angeles in July 2014 to  attend  the  John
         Tracey Clinic which was a leading diagnostic and  education  centre
         for young children with hearing loss'

11. The fact is however that Mr Flower did not refer to the fact that L  is
    currently in a 3  �  day  mainstream  nursery  place  although  he  did
    identify that he attends the therapeutic centre, which  he  does  every
    Wednesday.  There is no doubt that L receives specialist treatment  and
    that the appellant is involved in that  treatment  but  as  his  mother
    stated he has a learning support assistant at school  for  30  hours  a
    week and I consider this to show that L is  not  so  dependant  on  the
    appellant that her removal would have a significant effect  on  him  or
    that the appellant is still such significant member of L's  educational
    process.  Albeit that Judge Scott Baker recorded that L spends 40 hours
    with the appellant per week, as he is at school and frequently  in  the
    company of other adults not least his parents when out of school, I  do
    not accept that this is time that is exclusively with the appellant.

12. It is quite clear  that  L  has  been  given  a  statement  of  special
    educational needs and that he attends mainstream nursery  school  on  a
    regular basis (where he has a full-time place)  and  is  based  at  the
    therapeutic centre where he is receiving special educational  provision
    for  his  hearing  impairment  under  the  direction  of  a   qualified
    professional. The point was made by Mr Melvin that  the  appellant  was
    not qualified to address the needs of such a child and  whilst  it  was
    accepted she had attended some therapeutic sessions it was not accepted
    that the appellant had any  expertise  over  and  above  her  'pleasant
    nature and patience' with the child and an ability to fit in  with  the
    work schedules of the parents.  I take into account  that  the  parents
    are the primary carers  not  the  appellant  and  that  the  nature  of
    nannying is that it can be temporary.   The parents confirmed that they
    had set in train the process of seeking alternatives to employ.

13. Mr D, the father, also gave evidence that the appellant  generally  has
    weekends off. Evidence was also given by the parents  that  L's  family
    took him to Los Angeles in July 2014 for a number of  weeks  to  attend
    the John Tracey Clinic and the appellant did not accompany  him.   This
    did not indicate that the appellant was key to his ongoing therapy.

14. In view of the evidence given, although it may be in L's best interests
    to have no change in personnel at all, I am persuaded as he appears  to
    be, as the father gave evidence, settled and happy at school that he is
    able to adapt to or move on to  other  members  of  staff,  carers  and
    professionals because the school experience shows that he  has  already
    done so.

15. Indeed Mr Flower confirmed in an  addendum  to  his  assessment  report
    dated 3rd December 2014  that  L  had  responded  "well  to  the  total
    therapeutic package" which  included  the  appellant  but  I  note  the
    parents are also heavily involved with the therapeutic package,  indeed
    the appellant confirmed that  the  parents  attended  [the  speech  and
    language centre] when the appellant could not attend.  I conclude  that
    his parents as well as the appellant are fully aware of the  needs  and
    therapy given to L to  aid  his  progress.   Indeed  his  progress  was
    described as excellent.

16. The fact is that L has undergone significant  change  bearing  in  mind
    that he has attended school with a Learning Support Assistant and these
    skills will be generalised into his home environment.  He is in receipt
    of significant speech and  language  therapy  input  from  professional
    staff, not least trained speech and language therapists and  a  teacher
    of the deaf.

17. Mr D also confirmed that L's key special educational need  was  hearing
    impairment  and  his  emotional  difficulties  stemmed  from  that,  in
    particular he described confidence.  I have assessed his best interests
    and find that these are to remain with the care of his parents  and  to
    remain educated and in receipt of his therapy.

18. Bearing  in  mind  that  he  has,  as  Mr  D  confirmed,  no  cognitive
    difficulties I am not persuaded that  L's  needs  in  relation  to  his
    hearing impairment particularly as he is in receipt of such significant
    special educational provision and his parents and grandparents care and
    support outweigh the legitimate public interest as outlined in  Section
    117 of the Nationality Immigration and  Asylum  Act  2002  which  I  am
    enjoined to take into account.

19. The appellant speaks some English (but  not  fluent  English)  but  has
    always known that her  status  was  temporary  at  the  very  best  and
    latterly since her visa was refused it was precarious.  As recorded  in
    the determination of Judge Scott Baker the appellant entered the United
    Kingdom on 22nd October 2008 having obtained a Tier 4  visa.  As  Judge
    Scott Baker recorded with regards to the appellant

         "29. She entered the UK as a  student  but  did  not  complete  her
         studies as planned as the college closed.  Since  August  2011  she
         has worked part time with the D family and has  been  working  with
         them full time since September 2013.  The family were aware at  all
         times that the appellant did not hold a visa to work in the  United
         Kingdom in this capacity, although under the terms of her visa  she
         was permitted to work up to 20 hours per week.  It was  clear  from
         the outset of her employment that her discretionary visa expired in
         September 2012.  On this basis and without any specialist knowledge
         of caring for children  with  disabilities  the  parents  chose  to
         employ the appellant at the hourly rate of �6.80.  It  is  now  the
         case with the passage of time that the appellant has been  able  to
         grow into this job and develop some skills in caring  for  young  L
         and has been in this role full-time for approximately nine  months.
         I find that Mr and Mrs D were fully aware of the limitations on the
         appellant's visa and indeed on the appellant's skills  set  at  the
         commencement of her employment."

20. I have thoroughly explored the interests of L, and taken on  board  the
    careful submissions of Mr Nathan and although I have sympathy with  the
    parents' predicament that they wish to retain a carer who has been with
    the family for some time, I find  that  L's  progress  from  mainstream
    educational provision and the significant level of special  educational
    provision he is receiving is evidence.   The  mainstream  education  is
    independent  of  the  appellant  and  indeed  that  he  appears  to  be
    responding very well.  This does not  lead  me  to  conclude  that  the
    removal of the appellant is disproportionate or that the factors in the
    appellant's removal are outweighed by L's best interests.

21. Further to Huang [2007] UKUT 640 (IAC)

         'In an article 8 case where this question is reached, the  ultimate
         question for the appellate immigration  authority  is  whether  the
         refusal of leave to enter or remain,  in  circumstances  where  the
         life of the family cannot reasonably  be  expected  to  be  enjoyed
         elsewhere, taking full account of all  considerations  weighing  in
         favour of the refusal, prejudices the family life of the  applicant
         in a manner sufficiently serious to  amount  to  a  breach  of  the
         fundamental right protected by article 8. If  the  answer  to  this
         question is affirmative, the refusal is unlawful and the  authority
         must so decide. It is not necessary that the appellate  immigration
         authority, directing itself  along  the  lines  indicated  in  this
         opinion, need ask in addition whether the  case  meets  a  test  of
         exceptionality.

22. Taking all of my  reasoning  above  into  consideration,  I  find  that
    neither the family life nor the private life of the appellant nor L, or
    indeed of the parents, is prejudiced in a manner  sufficiently  serious
    to amount to a breach of any fundamental rights protected by Article 8.

23. Appeal dismissed.
