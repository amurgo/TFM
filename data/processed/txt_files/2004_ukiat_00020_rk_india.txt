Representation
For the appellant:           Mr A Bajwa, Counsel
For the respondent:    Miss C Hanrahan, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.    The appellant, who is a citizen of India,  has  been  given  leave  to
      appeal the determination of an Adjudicator (Mr J J Neyman)  dismissing
      his appeal against the respondent's refusal of 20 May  2002  to  grant
      her entry clearance as a working holidaymaker.

2.    The respondent was not satisfied  that  the  appellant  was  genuinely
      intending a working holiday in the  United  Kingdom  after  which  she
      would  leave.   Further,  that  the  financial  requirements  of   the
      Immigration Rules had been met.

3.    It is noteworthy  that  the  Adjudicator  accepted  that  the  sponsor
      intended and was able to  accommodate  the  appellant  in  the  United
      Kingdom at his cost and also to maintain her in  the  United  Kingdom.
      In so doing the appellant satisfied the requirements of Rule 95(v)  of
      HC395.

4.    The Adjudicator also accepted that the appellant had the means to  pay
      for her return or onward journey, thus satisfying the requirements  of
      Rule 95(iv).

5.    The Adjudicator, however, concluded that  he  was  not  satisfied  the
      appellant  would  return  to  India  "or  that  she  aspires  to  take
      employment there".

6.     Further,  the  Adjudicator  was  not  satisfied  that  the  appellant
      intended to leave the United Kingdom at the end of her working holiday
      and  therefore  failed  to  satisfy  the  requirements  of   paragraph
      95(viii).

7.    The Adjudicator made it clear at paragraph  24  of  his  determination
      that indeed it was paragraph 95(viii) that had not been satisfied  and
      thus led him to dismiss the appeal.

8.    We have decided to allow the appeal.

9.    It is apparent to us that the Adjudicator failed to  take  account  of
      the decision of the Tribunal in Amir Shahazad [2002]  UKIAT  03380  in
      which the Tribunal found (as was conceded in that case  on  behalf  of
      the respondent) that a working holidaymaker need not be  well  settled
      in his own country. The kind of employment which the appellant had  in
      mind in that case did not need  a  high  level  of  English  language,
      skills and his sponsor was earning a good income.  It is right to  say
      that under the old Rules HC251 paragraph 37 there  was  a  requirement
      that a working holidaymaker should not have settled down  in  his  own
      country.  This requirement did not appear at paragraph  95  of  HC395,
      although  the  working  holidaymaker  should  not   have   commitments
      necessitating a regular income.  Such commitments are of course  often
      adduced in visitor cases, to show that the visitor has an incentive to
      return to his own country.  They should not be expected in  a  working
      holiday case, to show that the appellant intends to leave  the  United
      Kingdom at the end of the holiday.

10.   It would appear, not least upon a  reading  of  paragraph  23  of  the
      Adjudicator's determination, that he placed great store  by  the  fact
      that the appellant had "no job to return to in India".   With  respect
      to the Adjudicator it is difficult to follow  his  reasoning  in  that
      regard, in that notwithstanding his acknowledgment that the  appellant
      had only just completed her University Degree course, the  Adjudicator
      concluded that as the appellant was prepared to spend:

           "the next two years in the United Kingdom, (it) indicates to  me
           that she has no plans formed on what she intends to do on return
           to India should she be allowed entry to the United Kingdom."

11.   It is apparent to us that the appellant having successfully  completed
      her degree course wished to take the opportunity to travel, not  least
      to the United  Kingdom,  as  a  working  holidaymaker  before  finally
      formulating plans for her future career.  In any  event,  as  we  have
      made clear, it is not a requirement that a working holidaymaker  needs
      to be well settled in her own country for the purposes  of  qualifying
      for a visa under paragraph 95 of HC 395.

12.   It was noteworthy that Ms Hanrahan for the respondent briefly  limited
      her remarks to explaining to us that having read all  the  papers  she
      simply invited the Tribunal "to take a view".  In  the  circumstances,
      and understandably, Mr  Bajwa  for  the  appellant  did  not  feel  it
      necessary to address us save to express his reliance on the grounds of
      appeal and the supporting documentation.

13.   From the evidence placed before the Adjudicator and having  considered
      the grounds and the documentation attached to them, we  are  satisfied
      that the appellant is able to meet all the requirements  of  paragraph
      95 and the appeal should be allowed.

14.   There is clearly no requirement the appellant be in a  "well  settled"
      situation in his or her own country prior to applying  for  a  working
      holiday visa.  Indeed,  as  the  Tribunal  observed  in  Shahazad  the
      opposite would appear to be the  case.   In  all  other  respects  the
      Adjudicator was rightly satisfied  that  the  appellant  met  all  the
      necessary requirements.

15.   We  therefore  reverse  the  Adjudicator's  decision  and  allow  this
      appeal.
