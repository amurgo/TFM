For the Respondent:    Mr D Clarke, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals with  permission  against  the  determination  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge I Ross promulgated on 2 December 2014.

 2. The appellant is a  citizen  of  Nigeria  who  arrived  in  the  United
    Kingdom, she says in 2004.  She has a daughter who was born here on  15
    February 2008. On 28 November 2008 she applied  for  an  EEA  residence
    permit which was refused.  Further applications were made for leave  to
    remain  most  recently  on   30   May   2012,   followed   by   further
    representations on 5 March 2014.

 3. The Secretary of State had considered that the appellant did  not  meet
    the requirements of  the  Immigration  Rules,  either  Appendix  FM  or
    paragraph 276ADE.  She also considered, having had due  regard  to  the
    best  interests  of  the  child,  that  there   were   no   exceptional
    circumstances such that she should  not  be  removed  from  the  United
    Kingdom.  The daughter did not have  a  right  of  appeal  against  the
    decision.

 4. On appeal, Judge Ross heard evidence from the appellant. He also  heard
    evidence from her former partner who is the father of  the  appellant's
    daughter who was at the time of the decision aged 6ï¿½.  It was  accepted
    before Judge Ross that the appellant could not meet the requirements of
    the Immigration Rules and thus the issue before the First-tier Tribunal
    was whether, notwithstanding that the Immigration Rules  could  not  be
    met, it would nonetheless be disproportionate in  article  8  terms  to
    remove the appellant.

 5. Judge Ross directed himself that he should approach the matter in  line
    with the decision in Gulshan (Article 8 - new Rules - correct approach)
    [201] UKUT 640 and concluded, on an  acceptance  by  Mr  Plowright  who
    appeared below as well as in front  of  me,  the  only  factor  in  the
    appellant's favour was her daughter who enjoyed  twice  weekly  contact
    with her father.  The judge considered although this was  an  important
    factor he noted that the daughter was born in the  UK  but  was  not  a
    British citizen and never had leave to remain here.   The  judge  noted
    that whilst there was twice weekly contact this did not  weigh  heavily
    in the appellant's favour given that the appellant is the primary carer
    for her daughter and they would be  removed  to  Nigeria  together,  it
    therefore being in the daughter's best interests  to  remain  with  the
    appellant.

 6. The judge's decision is further amplified at paragraphs 15 and 16 as to
    the balancing exercise to be undertaken.

 7. Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was sought  and  on  28  May
    2015 Upper  Tribunal  Judge  McWilliam  granted  permission  noting  in
    particular at paragraph 4 "it is arguable  that  the  decision  of  the
    child's best interests would be to return to Nigeria with her mother is
    inadequately reasoned in the light of the evidence of contact with  her
    father which was accepted by the judge."

 8. I heard submissions from both  representatives.   Mr  Plowright  relied
    primarily  on  his  grounds  and  submitted  that  the  reasoning   was
    inadequate particularly in the failure to deal adequately in the  light
    of the decision of  MK  [2015]  UKUT  223  in  that  the  analysis  was
    inadequate.

 9. Mr Clarke submitted that there was no material error and that  although
    this case might have adequately better been dealt with in light of  the
    decision in Singh & Khalid which of course was  promulgated  after  the
    decision of  Judge  Ross,  there  was  no  material  error  drawing  my
    attention in particular to the issues in EV (Philippines) in the  Court
    of Appeal.

10. I am satisfied that in this case the has not been a proper analysis  of
    the child's best interests given that there is no finding with  respect
    to whether there was a family life between the child  and  her  father.
    It is in the circumstances where  there  is  a  birth  parent  involved
    difficult to conclude that was not so.  The best interests of the child
    seemed to have been confined in the analysis to the  situation  of  the
    mother and whilst I bear in mind what was said in EV  (Philippines)  at
    [60] there is a difference here in that it appears that the father  did
    have the right to remain in the United Kingdom.  There  will  therefore
    be a severing  of  that  family  relationship.   In  the  circumstances
    therefore I am satisfied that the judge did  err  in  failing  to  have
    proper regard to the child's best interests  and  properly  to  analyse
    what that involved particularly in light of the contact with the father
    who it was not in dispute before the judge had the right to  remain  in
    the United Kingdom.  For these reasons I consider that the decision did
    involve the making of an error of law.

11. I am satisfied also that the decision is material given that it  cannot
    properly be said that the result would have been the same. Further,  it
    appears that on the facts as found by Judge Ross with  respect  to  the
    child's father that she may indeed have a right to remain in the United
    Kingdom given that she would appear prima facie to be a  family  member
    of an EEA national.  As her father is married to an  EEA  national  she
    would therefore appear to fall within Regulation 7 of  the  Immigration
    (European Economic) Area Regulations 2006.   As  the  position  of  the
    daughter appears to be substantially different from as it  appeared  to
    Judge Ross and there would need to be  an  extensive  additional  fact-
    finding, I am satisfied that on the particular facts of  this  case  it
    would be appropriate for the matter to be remitted  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

Summary of conclusions

 1. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did involve the  making  of  an
    error of law. I set it aside.

 2. The  appeal  is  remitted  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  a  fresh
    determination on all issues.
