Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr A Eaton instructed by Middlesex Law Chambers
For the Respondent:    Mr J McGirr, a Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants are the wife and children  of  the  sponsor,  who  is  a
    British citizen of Pakistani  origin.    They  appeal  with  permission
    against the dismissal  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  of  their  appeal
    against the respondent's decision to refuse them  EEA  residence  cards
    pursuant to Regulation 9 of the Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)
    Regulations 2016, as the spouse and family members of the sponsor,  the
    father of  the  first  appellant  and  the  father  of  the  other  six
    appellants.



Background

 2. The sponsor became a British citizen in 2013 and his family members all
    made what now appear to have been two visit visa applications on 14 May
    2013 and 2 October 2013 to come and  visit  him  from  Pakistan.   Both
    applications were refused  with  no  right  of  appeal;  there  was  no
    judicial review challenge to those decisions.  In  November  2013,  the
    sponsor bought a three-bedroom house in Derby which he furnished.

 3. The sponsor was unable to make an application for his family members to
    come and live with  him  in  the  United  Kingdom  as  his  spouse  and
    children, because he was only earning �12,000 from his employment  here
    and that was not enough to meet the  requirements  of  the  Immigration
    Rules.

 4. In February 2014, the sponsor gave notice to his employer in Derby, and
    signed a two-year tenancy for that house, with the tenant due  to  move
    out in February 2016.  He left the property with all of his  furniture,
    and moved to Ireland. It is clear at  [10]  in  the  sponsor's  witness
    statement that  he  received  legal  advice  surrounding  the  move  to
    Ireland.

 5. On 5 February 2014, the sponsor travelled to Ireland,  where  with  the
    help of a cousin, [TS], who is an Irish citizen and lives  in  Ireland,
    he rented an apartment, without even viewing it, and according  to  his
    witness statement and oral evidence, he set about  seeking  employment.
    The apartment he rented was much smaller than the  3-bedroom  house  he
    had just bought in Derby.  The sponsor asserted in  his  statement  and
    his evidence that he had every intention of settling  in  Ireland,  and
    that his wife and his children were happy to be living with him  again.



 6. I note that at [9] in his witness statement the sponsor  said  that  he
    was in and out of employment in Derby during 2013, and could not find a
    long term permanent job, but in his oral  evidence  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, he said that he had given notice from his  job  in  Derby  in
    order to travel to Ireland and that "I was open to the idea  of  moving
    back to the UK if I could not find any job opportunities in Ireland".

 7. The sponsor worked in Ireland for part of the  year  2014/2015  but  he
    only earned about �2,000.   The sponsor's family joined  him  gradually
    there and all, including his wife, entered education and  received  EEA
    residence cards from the Irish authorities.

 8. In November 2015, the sponsor had his property in Derby  valued  by  an
    estate agent.  There is no mention in that valuation  of  the  two-year
    tenancy  from  February  2014,  nor  of  the  fact  that  the  property
    presumably had a sitting tenant and that  is  a  matter  which  is  not
    explained anywhere in the sponsor's witness statement.

 9. The Irish tenancy  agreement  is  in  the  bundle.   It  is  a  curious
    document: the signatures are incomplete and the names of quite a number
    of parties to the tenancy seem  to  have  been  added  in  a  different
    handwriting.  The tenancy was taken from 1 February 2015 to 1  February
    2016, with its expiry coinciding with the end of the 2-year tenancy for
    the house in Derby.  It appears from a letter at page 304 in the bundle
    that the sponsor did not formally vacate the Irish  apartment  until  4
    August 2016.

10. On 24 June 2016, the United Kingdom in a referendum  decided  to  leave
    the EU.  The sponsor's cousin, Mr [S], in his  witness  statement  said
    that a lot of people were worried: Mr [S] decided to stay  in  Ireland,
    but he says that the sponsor and his family decided to  return  to  the
    United Kingdom.

11. The sponsor returned to the United Kingdom with his family members on 6
    July 2014, less than a fortnight after the referendum result.  At  [14]
    in his witness statement, the sponsor said "...  at  this  point  [i.e.
    after the EU referendum] I decided that I move back to the  UK  and  my
    family also joined me in the UK.  I had  taken  legal  advice  and  was
    aware that my family could accompany me to the UK under the EU  law  of
    free movement".



Refusal letter

12. The respondent by a letter dated  20  March  2017  asked  a  series  of
    questions to obtain the information required by Regulation  9,  and  by
    his own guidance on its application. He concluded that  the  conditions
    in Regulation 9 were not made out and that the  family's  residence  in
    Ireland was  not  'genuine'  but  was  an  attempt  to  circumvent  the
    requirements of entry clearance, in particular because of the sponsor's
    low income.

13. The respondent appears to have accepted that the adult children fell to
    be treated as family members, or at least it is not suggested  that  he
    did not.  But he was  not  satisfied  that  the  family  had  genuinely
    intended to move its centre of activity to Ireland,  noting  that  they
    had rented a relatively small flat  while  leaving  behind  a  recently
    purchased house in Derby with a tenant in it for only  two  years.   He
    refused the family leave to remain on EEA grounds under Article 9.

14. The appellants appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.



First-tier Tribunal decision

15. The First-tier Judge heard oral  evidence  from  the  sponsor  and  the
    principal appellant his wife and dealt with it adequately but  robustly
    from paragraph 12 to paragraph 21 of the First-tier decision.  He  held
    that the actions of the sponsor and these 7 appellants was  an  attempt
    to circumvent the Immigration  Rules,  the  financial  requirements  of
    which were out of reach for the sponsor, but that it  had  always  been
    the sponsor's intention to return to the United Kingdom in 2016.

16. The First-tier Tribunal dismissed the appeals. The appellants  appealed
    to the Upper Tribunal.



Permission to appeal

17. Permission to appeal was granted  on  the  basis  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal had arguably erred in failing  to  consider  the  respondent's
    policy  entitled  Free  Movement  Rights:  family  members  of  British
    citizens (25 October 2017), had failed to take  into  account  relevant
    matters and taken into account irrelevant matters,  and  had  erred  in
    fact and law in concluding that the purpose of the  family's  residence
    in Ireland was to circumvent  the  Immigration  Rules.   Permission  to
    appeal was granted on all grounds.



Rule 24 Reply

18. On 9 October 2018, the respondent served a Rule 24  Reply.   He  argued
    that on the basis of the evidence before him, the First-tier Judge  had
    been entitled to conclude that the sponsor's residence in  Ireland  was
    not genuine and was done solely as a means of circumventing the  United
    Kingdom immigration laws; and that the First-tier Judge's  findings  at
    [16]-[21] were adequate to support his Regulation 9 conclusions.

19. That is the basis on which these appeals came before me.



Upper Tribunal hearing

20. I heard submissions from both representatives, which I have taken  into
    account, which dealt mainly with the facts, and also the failure of the
    Judge to  set  out  the  contents  of  the  witness  statement  of  the
    appellant's  Irish  cousin,  or  that  of  the  sponsor  himself.   The
    background set out above includes the contents of those statements,  so
    far as relevant to  whether  the  family's  residence  in  Ireland  was
    'genuine' under the Regulations.



Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016, Regulation 9

21. Regulation 9 of the 2016 Regulations makes provision for family members
    to be granted a residence card in the United Kingdom, on the same basis
    as though their British citizen sponsor were an EEA citizen  exercising
    Treaty rights in the United Kingdom, provided that  they  have  resided
    together in another EEA state, with the British citizen so residing  as
    a worker, self-employed  person,  self-sufficient  person  or  student,
    immediately before their return to the United Kingdom, that they  lived
    together in the EEA state,  and  that  such  residence  was  'genuine'.
    'Genuine' is to be assessed under Regulation 9(3):

         "9...    (3)  Factors relevant to  whether  residence  in  the  EEA
             state is or was genuine include -

                  (a)  whether the centre of BC's life  transferred  to  the
                      EEA state;

                  (b)  the length of F and BC's joint residence in  the  EEA
                      state;

                  (c)  the nature and quality of F and BC's accommodation in
                      the EEA state and whether it is or was BC's principal
                      residence;

                  (d)  the degree of F  and  BC's  integration  in  the  EEA
                      state;

                  (e)  whether F's first lawful residence in the EU with  BC
                      was in the EEA state."

22. Regulation 9(4) contains exclusions:

         "9...    (4)  This Regulation does not apply -

                  (a)  where the purpose of the residence in the  EEA  state
                      was as a means for circumventing any immigration laws
                      applying  to  non-EEA  nationals  to  which  F  would
                      otherwise  be  subject  (such   as   any   applicable
                      requirement under the 1971 Act to have leave to enter
                      or remain in the United Kingdom); ..."



UKBA guidance: Free Movement Rights:  family  members  of  British  citizens
[Version 3.0, published 25 October 2017]

23. For the appellant, Mr Eaton relied on the respondent's 24 October  2017
    guidance on the application of Regulation 9, which so far  as  relevant
    is as follows:

             "Ordinarily non-EEA family members who wish to reside  in  the
             UK with British citizen sponsors must meet the requirements of
             the Immigration Rules.  If the  motivation  behind  the  joint
             residence in the EEA host  country  was  for  the  purpose  of
             bringing the family member to the UK under European  Union  EU
             law instead of those Rules such that the residence in the  EEA
             host country was  not  genuine,  the  applicant  will  not  be
             eligible to enjoy a right to reside in the UK  as  the  family
             member of  a  British  citizen  under  the  Immigration  (EEA)
             Regulations 2016, the 2016 Regulations and the residence  card
             application will be refused.  However if one  of  the  reasons
             for  moving  to  another  Member  State  was  to   avoid   the
             requirements of the Immigration Rules  but  the  residence  in
             that Member State  was  in  any  case  genuine  ...  then  the
             intention to avoid the requirements of the  Immigration  Rules
             is  not  in  itself  self-sufficient  to  refuse  to  issue  a
             residence card.

             Consideration of the 'purpose' test should  include,  but  may
             not be limited to:

             .    the  family  member's  immigration  history  -  including
                  previous applications for leave to enter or remain in  the
                  UK and whether they previously resided lawfully in the  UK
                  with the British citizen

             .    if the family has never made an application,  the  reason
                  the family member did not to apply  to  join  the  British
                  citizen in the UK before the British citizen moved to  the
                  EEA host country

             .    the timing and reason for the British citizen  moving  to
                  the EEA host country

             .    the timing and reason for the family member moving to the
                  EEA host country

             .    the timing and reason for the family  unit  returning  to
                  the United Kingdom."

                                                            [Emphasis added]

24. At page 157 an example is given as follows:

             "Contrast this with a non-EEA national who marries  a  British
             citizen while living  in  the  UK  unlawfully  then  makes  an
             application for leave to remain as the  spouse  of  a  British
             citizen.  This application is refused under Appendix FM to the
             Immigration  Rules  because  the  immigration  status  minimum
             income threshold and the English language requirements are not
             met, and they do not qualify for leave to remain  outside  the
             Rules because there are no exceptional circumstances  relating
             to family or  private  life.   The  couple  moves  to  Ireland
             together a month after the non-EEA national is  refused,  they
             rent a flat on a short term basis, the British  citizen  finds
             temporary work, there is minimal evidence of  any  integration
             and they return to the UK after six months.  In this  scenario
             the British citizen is technically  exercising  free  movement
             rights in the EEA host country, but it  is  likely  that  they
             have artificially created the necessary conditions  to  obtain
             an advantage from EU law so that the family member can  reside
             in the UK without having  to  meet  the  requirements  of  the
             Immigration Rules."

    That is not precisely the factual matrix in these appeals but there are
    strong parallels.



Analysis

25. The finding by the First-tier Tribunal that the family's  residence  in
    Ireland was not 'genuine' as Regulation 9 defines  that  concept  is  a
    finding of fact by the First-tier Tribunal with which I  may  interfere
    only on the basis set out  by  the  Court  of  Appeal  in  R  (Iran)  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2005] EWCA Civ 982 at  [90]
    in the judgment of Lord Justice Brooke.  A First-tier Tribunal  finding
    of fact may be overturned as an error of law only where such finding is
    perverse, irrational or Wednesbury unreasonable, wholly unsupported  by
    the evidence, or 'the [Judge] failed to identify and record the matters
    that were critical to his decision on material issues, in  such  a  way
    that [the Tribunal] was  unable  to  understand  why  he  reached  that
    decision'.

26. In this case, the facts found by the First-tier Judge are supported  by
    the evidence before him.  A more detailed examination of  the  evidence
    of Mr [S] and the sponsor's witness statement would not have led him to
    any different conclusion.  It was open to the First-tier Judge to  find
    on the evidence  that  this  was  an  arrangement  designed  to  create
    conditions in which the sponsor's family could join him in  the  United
    Kingdom  even  though  he  could  not  meet  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  In  particular,  given  the  evidence  of  the  two
    matching end dates for the tenancies in Derby and in  Ireland,  it  was
    open to the Judge to conclude  that  the  appellants  and  the  sponsor
    always planned to return to the United Kingdom in 2016, and  also  that
    it was incredible that all eight of them could have decided to  return,
    closed down their Irish lives, interrupted their studies, and  returned
    to the United Kingdom, less  than  a  fortnight  after  the  referendum
    outcome, if that were the reason for the change.

27. The First-tier Judge's conclusions were unarguably open to him  on  the
    evidence and there is no material error of law in his decision.

28. This appeal therefore falls to be dismissed and I uphold  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal.



DECISION

29. For the foregoing reasons, my decision is as follows:

   The making of the previous decision involved the making of no error on  a
   point of law
   I do not set aside the decision but order that it shall stand.
