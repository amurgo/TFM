Representation:
For the claimants:     Mr AN Ikie, solicitor
For the appellant:     Mr S Staunton, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants are husband, wife, son and daughter of the same  family,
    all citizens of Nigeria, with dates of birth as given in the case file.

 2. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against  the  decision  of
    First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Clarke   promulgated   26.6.15,   allowing
    variously on immigration and human rights ground the linked appeals  of
    the claimants against the decisions of the Secretary of State to refuse
    their applications for further leave to  remain  in  the  UK  on  human
    rights grounds and to remove them from the UK pursuant to section 47 of
    the Immigration Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.  The Judge  heard  the
    appeal on 21.5.15.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge Grimmett  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    2.10.15.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 22.1.16 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. For the reasons set out below, I found no material error of law in  the
    making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal such  as  to  require
    the decision of Judge Clarke to be set aside.

 6. The relevant background is set out in the case papers and summarised in
    Judge Clarke's decision. In essence the first claimant  first  came  to
    the UK in 2004 and was joined  in  2007  by  his  wife  and  their  two
    children. At all times they have had  limited  leave  to  remain,  last
    extended to 25.8.14. On 21.8.14  and  thus  within  extant  leave,  the
    claimants applied for further leave to remain on  the  basis  of  their
    private  and  family  life.  The  applications  were  considered  under
    Appendix FM and paragraph 276ADE and refused, accompanied by  decisions
    to remove from the UK.

 7. Judge Clarke concluded that  as  at  the  date  of  hearing  the  first
    claimant met the 10-year long-residence requirements of paragraph 276B,
    by which time he had accumulated 10 years' continuous lawful  residence
    in the UK.

 8. The Secretary of State could not have considered paragraph 276B as  the
    first claimant did not meet the 10 year requirement either at the  date
    of application or decision and it was not in any event  an  application
    made by him. That issue was first raised in the grounds  of  appeal  to
    the First-tier Tribunal. It is relevant to note that even  the  at  the
    date of the submission of the grounds of appeal on 5.11.14,  the  first
    claimant still could not meet the 10-year requirement,  which  Mr  Ikie
    told me was only reached on 23.11.14.  What the grounds suggest is that
    by the time the appeal comes on for hearing he would have  reached  the
    10-year milestone. Such a prospective  claim  cannot  be  an  effective
    ground of appeal against the decision of the Secretary of State, but it
    certainly served to put the Secretary of  State  on  notice  that  this
    issue would be raised at the First-tier Tribunal appeal hearing. As  it
    happened, there was no response to the grounds of appeal  and  in  fact
    the Secretary of State had no representative at that appeal hearing.

 9. Mr Ike pointed out that the Secretary of State served on the  claimants
    one-stop notices under section 120 of the 2002 Act, requiring  them  to
    inform the Secretary of State of any reasons  why  they  consider  they
    should be allowed to remain in the UK. He relied on the Court of Appeal
    decision of AS (Afghanistan) v SSHD [2009] EWCA Civ 1076, in which  the
    court held at �84 that as the service  of  such  a  notice  is  in  the
    discretion of the Secretary of State, there being no obligation  to  do
    so, the Secretary of State "will presumably do so only if he is content
    that the Tribunal should consider any matters put forward  in  response
    to it." It was said that whilst the Secretary of State is normally  the
    primary decision-maker in immigration matters, in practice the Tribunal
    makes many decisions which are indistinguishable from those made by the
    Secretary of State. Section 85(2) imposes a duty  on  the  Tribunal  to
    consider any matter raised in a statement made in response to a section
    120 notice, insofar as it constitutes a ground of  appeal  against  the
    decision under appeal. The court held  that  these  provisions  do  not
    restrict that duty to considering only grounds  that  relation  to  the
    reasons for the decision made. It is obvious that section 120 notice is
    designed to raise any new grounds for challenging the decision,  rather
    than simply challenging the reasons for the decision,  including  those
    which could be capable of supporting a fresh application.

10. In the grounds of application for permission to appeal the Secretary of
    State accepts that it was open to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  to
    consider the issue of long-residency under paragraph  276B,  which  was
    raised in the grounds of appeal. I pointed out to Mr  Ike  he  did  not
    need to argue that point.

11. However, it appears to me that the Secretary of  State's  grounds  have
    confused different aspects of paragraph 276B. The first ground is  that
    the judge erred in concluding that as there  was  no  evidence  to  the
    contrary, the appellant had satisfied 276B(ii). That ground goes on  to
    state that it is an essential requirement to have regard to the  public
    interest. "It is respectfully submitted  that  it  is  insufficient  to
    simply state that because there was no evidence to the contrary  before
    him, the appellant satisfied this requirement." That is a misreading of
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.  Judge  Clarke  addressed  the
    public interest at �35 of the decision, taking into account the various
    factors, including those specified under 276B(ii)(a) to  (f).  In  this
    consideration the judge did not state that there was no evidence to the
    contrary. That  was  in  relation  to  the  subsequent  requirement  of
    paragraph 276B(iii), that of the general ground for refusal, which  the
    judge addressed in the first part of  �36  of  the  decision,  stating,
    "There was no evidence before me that Mr  Emasiobi  falls  for  refusal
    under the general grounds for refusal."

12. Clearly, the author of the grounds of  application  for  permission  to
    appeal has confused and conflated the judge's treatment of 276B(ii) and
    276B(iii). I find no error of  law  in  the  way  in  which  the  judge
    assessed the public interest. As far  are  276B(iii)  and  the  general
    grounds for refusal, I note that even now the Secretary of  State  does
    not suggest there are any such grounds and did not in fact rely on that
    issue in the grounds for application for permission to appeal.

13. Where there is a real issue is the point made towards the end of �1  of
    the grounds that, "As the application was considered under a completely
    different rule, this particular requirement has never been explored  by
    the SOS and as such there would have been no evidence placed before the
    First-tier Tribunal, which renders the positive conclusion  of  the  IJ
    unsound." In essence, the Secretary of State submits that if the First-
    tier  Tribunal  Judge  felt  that  the  first  claimant  now  met   the
    requirements of paragraph 276B,  the  judge  should  have  allowed  the
    appeal only to the extent of finding  that  the  decision  was  not  in
    accordance with the law and awaits a decision  from  the  Secretary  of
    State that is in  accordance  with  the  law.  I  do  not  accept  this
    proposition. The decision of the Secretary of State was  in  accordance
    with the law as the first claimants  circumstances  then  stood.  I  am
    satisfied that it was open to the judge to consider all the elements of
    paragraph 276B on the available evidence. As the Secretary of State had
    issued a section 120 notice it was up to the Secretary of State to draw
    the Tribunal's attention to any factors which suggested that the  first
    claimant did not meet the  requirement,  or  why  the  public  interest
    required the application to be refused.

14. The second ground of appeal is that the First-tier Tribunal Judge erred
    in finding the first claimant met the English language requirements  of
    paragraph 276B, stating that  the  judge  was  not  provided  with  the
    required evidence. The rather late in the day served Rule  24  response
    of the claimants points out that at A24 is a Knowledge of Life  in  the
    UK pass certificate, and the degree certificate at A26 appears to  meet
    the requirements of Appendix KoLL. Mr Staunton conceded this issue  and
    I need address it no further  other  than  to  accept  that  the  first
    claimant met this requirement.

15. The third ground of appeal falls away if there is no error in  relation
    to the First-tier Tribunal's consideration of paragraph 276B  and  need
    be considered no further.

16. The final ground of appeal is to suggest that the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge failed in the consideration of the remaining  family  members  in
    making no assessment of their cases under the  Immigration  Rules,  and
    simply proceeded to consider the cases on the basis of article 8  ECHR.
    However, at �38 of the decision the judge noted that at the date of the
    application the other claimants could not meet the requirements of  the
    Rules and continued, "That being the case the next step was to consider
    whether or not the Appellants had demonstrated that they  had  a  good,
    arguable case that leave should be granted under article 8 outside  the
    Immigration Rules." The judge in fact mistakes the current law on  this
    issue, which is that there is no need to  establish  a  "good  arguable
    case,"  only  that  there  should  be  compelling   circumstances   not
    adequately addressed within the Rules to justify  considering  granting
    leave to remain on private and/or family life grounds outside the Rules
    under article 8 ECHR. See Singh [2015] EWCA Civ 74, where it  was  held
    that there is no need to conduct a full separate examination of article
    8 outside the Rules where, in the circumstances, of a particular  case,
    all the issues have been  addressed  in  the  consideration  under  the
    Rules.

17. However, I find no material error in this regard.  It  is  quite  clear
    that the other claimants could not meet the Rules and in the  light  of
    the fact that the judge found the first claimant husband and father did
    meet the Rules for leave to remain it was inevitable that  there  would
    have to be a family  life  assessment  outside  the  Rules  as  to  the
    proportionality of requiring them to  leave  when  he  is  entitled  to
    remain. Judge Clarke went on to conduct that article 8  assessment  and
    concluded that it would be disproportionate to remove them. That was  a
    conclusion open to the judge and for which  cogent  reasons  have  been
    given. The grounds do not in fact challenge the assessment  made,  only
    the decision to consider their circumstances outside the Rules  without
    identifying  compelling  circumstances.  There  is  no  merit  in  this
    challenge and thus no material error of law.

Conclusion & Decision:

18. For the reasons set out herein, I find that the making of the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

                    I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal of each appellant remains allowed.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order. Given the  circumstances,  I  also  make  no
anonymity order.



Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge to decline to make  a
fee award because the basis of allowing the appeal was not a  ground  before
the Secretary of State and could not have been considered by  the  Secretary
of State is valid and I adopt the same reasoning.
