Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Eaton, counsel
For the Respondent:    Ms Willocks-Briscoe, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This matter comes before me for consideration  as  to  whether  or  not
    there is a material error of law in  the  determination  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Ghani ("the FTTJ") promulgated on 12 May 2015, in  which
    the FTTJ dismissed the appellant's appeal against the  refusal  of  his
    asylum claim.

Background

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Iran. He claims to be an Ahwazi Arab  and
    a  Sunni  Muslim.   Both   are   minority   groups   which   experience
    discrimination in Iran.  The  appellant  claimed  to  have  distributed
    pamphlets to raise awareness of the problems  faced  by  Arabs  in  and
    around Ahwaz. It is claimed the appellant's  home  was  raided  by  the
    authorities, as was that of his parents. Some of his  possessions  were
    confiscated and his wife, brother  and  father  were  detained.   As  a
    result of this the appellant fled  with  his  wife  and  two  children,
    travelling to the UK where they claimed asylum.


 3. The appellant's asylum claim was refused on various grounds,  including
    the fact that the appellant's asylum interview was conducted  in  Farsi
    and there were discrepancies in the appellant's account  for  which  he
    was unable to provide a reasonable explanation.

 4. Permission to appeal was granted in the following terms:

            "2. Given that the core issue in the appellant's case was  that
           he was at risk of persecution in Iran due to his being an Ahwazi
           Arab activist it is arguable that the Judge erred by failing  to
           take into  account  in  his  consideration  of  the  Appellant's
           ethnicity the fact that the Appellant gave his evidence  at  the
           hearing in Arabic and not in Farsi. In such circumstances it  is
           arguable that the Judge's failure to  have  regard  to  material
           evidence amounted to an error of law.


            3. It is also arguable that the Judge erred by failing to  deal
           with issues raised by the Appellant in his skeleton argument and
           to give reasons why he rejected the submissions.


            4. The Judge's consideration  of  the  best  interests  of  the
           children at para 50 of his decision is woefully  inadequate  and
           amounts to a clear error of law [sic].


            5. For these reasons both the grounds and the decision disclose
           arguable errors of law."


 5. Thus the matter comes before me.

Submissions on Error of Law


 6. Mr Eaton, for the appellant, referred to the findings of the FTTJ  with
    regard to the language spoken  by  the  appellant  (paragraph  42).  He
    submitted that those findings ignored the fact that the  appellant  had
    given all his oral evidence at the hearing, for over an hour, in Ahwazi
    Arabic. It was perverse for the FTTJ to find that the appellant did not
    speak Ahwazi Arabic in such circumstances. If the FTTJ had found  as  a
    fact that the appellant had not spoken  Arabic  when  giving  his  oral
    evidence, the FTTJ should have said as much and given his  reasons  for
    such a finding.  This  issue  also  impacted  on  the  FTTJ's  findings
    generally on the appellant's credibility.


 7. Mr Eaton also submitted that the FTTJ had failed to make findings  with
    regard to the appellant's wife's claimed  detention  and  her  evidence
    generally.  She was not giving third party evidence;  she  herself  had
    suffered persecution.  She had provided a witness statement.  The  FTTJ
    refers only to her detention and release being a "mystery".  A  finding
    of fact was required because her evidence was material to the  risk  of
    persecution on return. Her detention was the single most material  part
    of the claim and  proved  that  the  family  was  of  interest  to  the
    authorities.


 8. With regard to the appellant's associations with the  Ahwazi  community
    in the UK, Mr Eaton submitted insufficient reasons had been  given  for
    discounting the docuemntary evidence as to the  appellant's  ethnicity.
    The Ahwazi Copmmunity Association in the UK had a degree  of  expertise
    on the issue.   Mr Eaton also submitted that the plausibility  findings
    in paragraph 43, with regard to  the  distribution  of  leaflets,  were
    perverse and speculative.  It was not clear from the decision  why  the
    FTTJ had found the appellant's account and explanations incredible. The
    FTTJ was concerned at the lack of corroboration but this is  often  the
    case in asylum appeals; the FTTJ found it perverse that the appellant's
    computer was kept at  home  and  not  at  a  community  centre  yet  no
    explanation is provided for this and it could be considered that a home
    is more secure than a community centre which was accessible to  others.
    It was said in the decision to be implausible that other family members
    did not know what the appellant was doing  but  the  reverse  is  true,
    given the nature of the appellant's activities: they were  illegal.  Mr
    Eaton  summarised  that  the  FTTJ  had  failed  to  engage  with   the
    appellant's evidence given by  way  of  explanation  eg  his  using  an
    internet cafï¿½ for skype calls because  he  feared  these  conversations
    might be tapped.


 9. In summary, Mr Eaton submitted that there were a number of plausibility
    findings and matters of speculation which were based on what  the  FTTJ
    thought would have happened and not the appellant's own account.


10. For the respondent, Ms Willocks-Briscoe relied on the R24  response  to
    the effect that the FTTJ had assessed all the evidence  in  the  round,
    having identified inconsistencies in the appellant's evidence regarding
    his ethnicity and  ability  to  speak  Farsi  and  Arabic.  The  FTTJ's
    credibility findings were based on  "the  discrepancies  cumulatively".
    Credibility was primarily a question of fact and the FTTJ had  provided
    sustainable findings.  Ms Willocks-Briscoe said that it was not outside
    the realms of possibility that, having lived in  Ahwaz,  the  appellant
    spoke Ahwazi Arabic.  She agreed that there was no finding with  regard
    to the weight to be given to the Ahwazi Community Association document.
     She accepted that there should have been reasons for discounting  this
    document. She submitted that, instead, the FTTJ relied on a combination
    of factors in dismissing the appellant's claim to be  an  Ahwazi  Arab.
    The FTTJ had noted  inconsistencies  with  regard  to  the  appellant's
    evidence of his language abilities.  Ms Willocks-Briscoe  agreed  that,
    in many instances, the FTTJ had not set out  the  basis  on  which  the
    appellant's explanations were found to be inadequate.  She also  agreed
    that there was no finding by  the  FTTJ  that  the  appellant's  wife's
    evidence had been rejected.  She submitted that, having found the  core
    of the account incredible, the rest of the claim fell  away.   Finally,
    even if there was a material  error  of  law,  the  FTTJ  had  made  an
    alternative finding that, as an Arab, the appellant was not at risk  on
    return.

Discussion


11. I showed the parties' representatives the  first  page  of  the  FTTJ's
    record of proceedings which refers to the attendance of an  interpreter
    in Arabic (Middle East).  There is no reference in that record  to  the
    dialect being Ahwazi Arabic.  However, the  tribunal  file  contains  a
    letter from the appellant's representatives requesting an Ahwazi Arabic
    interpreter for the hearing and the tribunal issued a notice  that  "an
    appropriate interpreter will be arranged".  The decision  of  the  FTTJ
    makes no mention of the appellant's oral evidence being  given  through
    any interpreter (irrespective of language). Given that the reasons  for
    refusal of the asylum claim make it clear that a  principal  issue  for
    the respondent was the fact he spoke Farsi  in  the  asylum  interview,
    this is surprising. Thus there are several  potential  inconsistencies:
    the appellant requested an  Ahwazi  Arabic  interpreter;  the  Tribunal
    confirmed an "appropriate interpreter" would be arranged; the appellant
    spoke through an interpreter in the hearing; the record of  proceedings
    refers to an "Arabic (ME)" interpreter being present, it  is  submitted
    the appellant gave oral evidence through an interpreter speaking Ahwazi
    Arabic  and  the  decision  makes  no  reference  to  the  use  of  any
    interpreter at all.  The respondent does not  dispute  the  use  of  an
    interpreter and this is consistent with the content of  the  record  of
    proceedings. However, it is not clear in what  language  the  appellant
    gave his oral evidence at the hearing, whether Ahwazi  Arabic  or  not.
    Given that the quality of the appellant's  Arabic  language  skills  is
    central to an assessment of his ethnicity, and had been  identified  as
    such by the respondent, I would expect the  FTTJ  to  have  taken  into
    account, in making his findings on his ethnicity, the  appellant's  use
    of an interpreter during the hearing.  This is not a matter  which  can
    be discounted from an overall assessment of the appellant's credibility
    as regards his ability  to  speak  Arabic.   The  FTTJ  has  identified
    various inconsistencies in the appellant's evidence but has  failed  to
    take this central issue into account in concluding that  the  appellant
    is not an Ahwazi Arab.  The failure of the FTTJ to do so and to make  a
    fully reasoned finding on the appellant's ability to speak Arabic is  a
    fundamental flaw in the  assessment  of  the  appellant's  evidence  as
    regards his ethnicity.


12. I note the respondent's submission that the FTTJ  made  an  alternative
    finding about the risk on return  for  an  Iranian  Arab  such  as  the
    appellant,  but  this  is  premised  on  a  flawed  finding  that   the
    appellant's account was wholly unreliable  (including  as  regards  the
    claim to have been persecuted previously) and that he was not therefore
    at risk on return as a result of his  activities.   The  findings  with
    regard to his activities were made "in the round" and  that  assessment
    included a negative finding with regard to the  appellant's  ethnicity.
    That ethnicity finding, for the reason stated,  is  flawed.   Thus  the
    alternative finding about risk on return for an Iranian  Arab  is  also
    flawed.

13. For these reasons, the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  contains  a
    material error of law in the assessment of the evidence on  credibility
    and the FTTJ's decision on asylum grounds must  be  set  aside  in  its
    entirety.  All parties were agreed that, in such circumstances, it  was
    appropriate for the appeal to  be  decided  afresh  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.   Given this finding I  have  not  considered  the  remaining
    grounds of appeal to this tribunal.

Decision

14. The making of the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the
    making of an error on a point of law.  The decision is set aside in its
    entirety.  The appeal is remitted to the  First-tier  Tribunal,  to  be
    dealt with afresh, pursuant to  Section  12(2)(b)(i)  of  the  Tribunal
    Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 and Practice Statement  7.2(v),  before
    any judge aside from FTTJ Ghani.


15. Given the outcome of this appeal and my findings, below,  an  anonymity
    order is appropriate.
