Representation:
For the Secretary of State:     Mr N Bramble, Specialist Appeals Team
For the Respondent/Claimant:    Mr Ikeh, Solicitor, Moorhouse Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Secretary of State appeals to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal allowing the claimant's appeal  against  the
    decision to refuse him leave to  remain  as  a  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)
    Migrant on the ground that the Secretary of  State's  refusal  decision
    was not in accordance with the law, and a lawful decision in compliance
    with her policy on evidential flexibility was outstanding.  The  First-
    tier Tribunal did not  make  an  anonymity  direction,  and  I  do  not
    consider that such a direction is warranted for  these  proceedings  in
    the Upper Tribunal.

 2. The claimant applied for leave to remain as a Tier 1  Entrepreneur,  on
    the basis that he had  set  up  a  business  trading  as  "IIEE  Global
    Engineers", which was  a  specialist  firm  dealing  with  the  design,
    installations,  maintenance,  commissioning,  repairs,  inspection  and
    testing of electrical installations, sales and security  systems.   The
    services advertised in  the  promotional  literature  for  IIEE  Global
    Engineers  were:  CCTV  installations  testing;  CCTV  IP   networking;
    biometric access control; video monitoring system design, installation,
    maintenance,  commissioning,  repair,   inspection   and   testing   of
    electrical installations; and intruder alarm sales and security.

 3. He enclosed with his  application  two  invoices  tendered  by  him  to
    Optimum  Security  Supplies  Limited  on  7  and   21   December   2012
    respectively.  The first invoice  was  for  the  installation  of  CCTV
    cameras, DBR, commissioning and testing and access control installation
    in the amount of �350.49.  The second invoice was for the  installation
    of a biometric access control system, CCTV cameras, a computer  station
    for control and  closed  circuit  television  CCTV  at  Morgan  Sindall
    construction sites, for an amount of �235; and the installation of CCTV
    cameras  and  DBR,  commissioning  and  testing   at   Willmott   Dixon
    Construction for the sum of �310.  There were also  two  further  items
    which were charged at �25.30.  The second invoice was also rendered  to
    Optimum Security Supplies Limited.

 4. The claimant did not however provide a contract  between  him/his  firm
    and Optimum Security Supplies Limited relating to the services  covered
    by the two invoices.

The Reasons for Refusal

 5. The claimant  made  his  application  on  28  December  2012,  and  the
    application was refused on 26 February 2014.  He was awarded  0  points
    for attributes under Appendix A, because he had not provided sufficient
    evidence to show that he met the requirements contained in subparagraph
    (iv), namely that he was:

         "... engaged in  business  activity  ...  in  an  occupation  which
         appears  on  the  list   of   occupations   skilled   to   National
         Qualifications Framework level 4 or above, as stated in  the  Codes
         of Practice in Appendix J, and provides the specified  evidence  in
         paragraph 41-SD"

 6. Although he had provided a job title that was listed in Appendix J, the
    only evidence he had submitted to demonstrate that  he  was  active  in
    that occupation as part of his business,  IIEE  Global  Engineers,  was
    some advertising leaflets and posters.  But that advertisement did  not
    contain his name and therefore it did not meet the requirements  listed
    at paragraph 41-SD(c)(iii) of Appendix A of the Rules.  Furthermore, he
    had provided no contracts to confirm that he was  engaged  in  business
    activity as claimed.  He had submitted an invoice but this  was  not  a
    contract and it did not demonstrate his business activity or  meet  the
    required criteria required of a contract according to the Rules.  As  a
    result of the above, he had  not  demonstrated  that  he  had  met  the
    requirements of the Rules to be awarded points under provision  (d)  of
    Table 4 of Appendix A.

The Grounds of Appeal to the FTT

 7. The claimant's representatives settled detailed grounds  of  appeal  on
    his behalf.  In addition to the documents  listed  in  part  B  of  the
    application form, the claimant had also submitted a few extra documents
    which he had not listed there as there were no more boxes for those  to
    be listed.  This might explain why the Home Office might have misplaced
    some documents from his file which he had submitted to the Home  Office
    with his application.  He had duly submitted "the original contract" as
    per the requiremen, which might have been misplaced by the Home Office.

 8. If there  had  been  missing  evidence  or  further  clarification  was
    necessary, under the terms of the evidential  flexibility  policy,  the
    Home Office ought to have contacted the claimant.

The Hearing Before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

 9. The claimant's appeal came before Judge Morgan sitting at Taylor  House
    in the First-tier Tribunal on 11  December  2014.   Both  parties  were
    legally represented.  The claimant's representatives prepared a  bundle
    of documents which contained an agreement for engineering services made
    on 19 December 2012 by Clyn Technologies International  UK  Limited  on
    the one part, and  IIEE  Global  Engineers  on  the  other  part.   The
    agreement was signed by the appellant as  a  director  of  IIEE  Global
    Engineers.

10. The bundle also contained an unsigned letter from the  appellant  dated
    28 December 2012 headed "Additional information  to  be  considered  as
    part of my application".  The letter said that he  was  working  as  an
    engineer through his company IIEE Global Engineers Limited, and he  was
    also maintaining  a  professional  working  relationship  with  Optimum
    Security Supplies Limited, as could be seen  in  the  invoice  attached
    with the application.  He went on to list various  documents  which  he
    said had been included as part of his submission.  The list included:

       . Invoices showing descriptions of jobs/contract already done.

       . A contract document for a new job to commence March 2015.

       . Company fliers and copies of the company website pages.

11. He went on to say that he had provided a payment invoice  as  proof  of
    contracts carried out under  his  new  company  IIEE  Global  Engineers
    Limited.  He had also provided "a private short agreement contract note
    for incoming job in 2013".

12. In a signed witness statement dated 9 October 2014, he said that he had
    provided a copy of his  contract  with  Clyn  Technologies  Limited  as
    evidence to demonstrate  business  activity.  The  SSHD  was  wrong  in
    concluding that he did not include these documents and information.  By
    way of appeal, he had also provided other supporting documents  showing
    more contracts which were signed in the last year, and further invoices
    issued as evidence of his trading activities.  The recent contracts  in
    the bundle comprised (a) an agreement made on 1  October  2013  between
    Optimum Securities Limited and IIEE  Global  Engineers  Limited  headed
    "Engineering  service  subcontractor  agreement",   and   (b)   another
    engineering service subcontractor agreement entered into  with  Optimum
    Security Supplies Limited on 1 October 2014. Both contracts were for  a
    period of one year.

13. In his subsequent decision, the judge said the refusal  identified  one
    matter in issue.   In  particular,  the  Secretary  of  State  was  not
    satisfied that the claimant was entitled to the  points  claimed  under
    attributes because, although all of the  required  documents  had  been
    provided, they were not all in the requisite format.  In the  light  of
    the documents before him, and in particular those contained within  the
    claimant's bundle, he was satisfied the claimant  could  have  provided
    the Secretary of State with evidence in the requisite format  prior  to
    the making of the decision.  Rule 245AA gave the Home Office discretion
    to contact an applicant where a document  was  provided  in  the  wrong
    format.  He found that this discretion  had  not  been  exercised,  and
    accordingly in the light of Ukus (discretion: when  reviewable)  [2012]
    UKUT 00307 (IAC), the decision was not in accordance with the  law  and
    should be sent back to the Secretary of State to  enable  the  decision
    maker to reach a lawful decision.

The Application for Permission to Appeal

14. A member of the Specialist  Appeals  Team  applied  on  behalf  of  the
    Secretary of State for permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.  The
    only evidence submitted by the claimant to demonstrate he was active in
    a relevant occupation was some advertising leaflets and  posters.   The
    advertisements did not contain his name, and therefore did not meet the
    requirements as listed at paragraph 41-SD(c)(iii) of Appendix A of  the
    Rules.  It was submitted that evidential flexibility did not  apply  to
    this case.

The Grant of Permission to Appeal

15. On 9 February 2015  Designated  Judge  McClure  granted  permission  to
    appeal for the following reasons:

         "This was not a case where the documentation was lacking  or  where
         one in a series of documents appeared to have been omitted,  rather
         that the documents submitted did not comply with the Rules.  In the
         circumstances  where  the   advertisements   did   not   meet   the
         requirements of the Rules it is arguable that the judge in allowing
         the appeal has made an error of law."

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

16. At the hearing before  me,  Mr  Bramble  relied  on  Akhter  &  Another
    (paragraph 245AA: wrong format) [2014] UKUT 297 (IAC) in support of the
    submission that the judge erred in law in  finding  that  the  claimant
    could invoke paragraph 245AA in  support  of  the  contention  that  he
    should have been given an opportunity to rectify  the  deficiencies  in
    his advertising material.   The  advertisement  did  not  constitute  a
    document that was in the wrong format.

17. On the other hand, he accepted that the judge could  have  treated  the
    advertising  material  as  coming  within  245AA(b)(iv)  as  it  was  a
    specified  document  that  did  not  contain  all  of   the   specified
    information.

18. But he submitted  there  was  an  unresolved  question  as  to  whether
    245AA(c) applied.  245AA(c) provides as follows:

         "Documents will not be requested where a specified document has not
         been submitted (for example  an  English  language  certificate  is
         missing), or where the ... Secretary of State does  not  anticipate
         that addressing the omission or error referred to  in  subparagraph
         (b) will lead to a grant because the application  will  be  refused
         for other reasons."

19. After hearing from Mr Ikeh, who did not appear below, I  ruled  in  the
    Secretary of State's favour.  I found that an error  of  law  had  been
    made out, and I gave my reasons for  so  finding  in  short  form.   My
    extended reasons for finding an error of law are set out below.

20. I then proceeded to receive evidence and submissions for  the  purposes
    of remaking  the  decision.   The  claimant,  who  was  in  attendance,
    confirmed that he had provided the contract dated 19 December 2012 with
    the application.  Mr Bramble pointed out  that  the  contract  was  not
    included in the documents listed in the application  form  itself,  and
    queried whether it had in fact been provided.  But he  did  not  cross-
    examine the claimant on this issue.

21. Even if I was satisfied that the contract had been  provided  with  the
    application, Mr Bramble submitted that it did not in fact show that the
    claimant was active in his stated occupation as part of  his  business.
    This was because the contract related to work to be done in the future.

22. In reply, Mr Ikeh submitted that the contract did the job  required  of
    it.  Even if it was a contract relating  to  future  activities,  there
    were invoices provided with  the  application  which  showed  that  the
    claimant was trading.

Reasons for Finding an Error of Law

23. The reasoning of the judge with regard  to  the  Secretary  of  State's
    alleged  breach  of  evidential  flexibility  principles  was   flawed.
    Firstly, the judge primarily based his decision on  a  policy  document
    issued in May 2011.  But this had been superseded by  the  introduction
    of Immigration Rule 245AA.  As noted by the Upper Tribunal in paragraph
    [14] of Akhter, paragraph 245AA  was  introduced  with  effect  from  6
    September 2012.   So  it  was  this  paragraph  which  applied  to  the
    application, not the  earlier  policy  guidance  cited  by  the  judge.
    Secondly, although the judge moved on to a consideration  of  paragraph
    245AA, he was simply wrong to characterise the advertising material  as
    a document "in the wrong format".

24. The judge's error in this regard would not have been  material  if  the
    only stated deficiency in the application had been the provision of one
    specified document which did not contain all the specified information.
     But this is  not  the  case.   The  refusal  was  also  based  on  the
    proposition that the claimant had not provided a specified document  at
    all, namely a contract showing trading.

25. Mr Ikeh said his instructions were that the parties had agreed  at  the
    hearing that the claimant had in  fact  provided  the  contract  of  19
    December 2012 with the  application.   This  did  not  accord  with  Mr
    Bramble's instructions, and such a concession is not  clearly  recorded
    by the judge in his decision.  Moreover,  the  judge  has  not  made  a
    finding on whether the contract of 19 December 2012 "does the job",  as
    Mr  Ikeh  puts  it.   Such  a  finding  was  reasonably   required   in
    circumstances where the claimant expressly put forward the contract  as
    not relating to work which he was about to undertake,  It was expressly
    put forward on the basis that it related to a future job in March 2013,
    which was three months after the agreement was signed.

26. For the above reasons, the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  is
    vitiated by a material error of law such that it should  be  set  aside
    and remade.

The Remaking of the Decision

27. How the decision should be remade hinges on two questions.   The  first
    is whether the contract of 19  December  2012  was  provided  with  the
    application; and, if so, whether it is a contract "showing trading".

28. I find on the balance of probabilities that the contract of 19 December
    2012 was provided with the application under cover of the letter  dated
    28 December 2012.  However, it does not confirm that the  claimant  was
    engaged in business activity as claimed. It  does  now  show  that  the
    claimant was trading.

29. Firstly, as previously noted, the contract was put forward as a  future
    contract relating to work that was not going to be  embarked  on  until
    March 2013.  Secondly, on analysis the contract  is  no  more  than  an
    agreement to negotiate.  It is far too vague to constitute a valid  and
    legally binding contract.  It lacks legal certainty, and would  not  be
    enforceable as a contract.  This is typified  by  two  aspects  of  it.
    Under the heading of "Scope of services" it is stated  that  the  owner
    (Clyn Technologies) may require  various  engineering  and  maintenance
    services to assist in planning, design and operation of "his  company".
    The significance of the word "may" is that the owner is not  committing
    himself to using the claimant's services.  In effect, he is  saying  no
    more than he  might  wish  to  use  the  claimant's  services  at  some
    indeterminate point in the future.

30. Secondly, under the heading of compensation, the following  is  stated:
    "Compensation for each  project  assigned  to  the  engineer  shall  be
    negotiated individually on a lump sum or hourly basis, as determined by
    the defined scope of work."  As the remuneration for  each  project  is
    something that is going to have to be negotiated  individually  in  the
    future, the document does not create any legal  relations  between  the
    parties to it.

31. As remuneration for the services to be provided has  not  been  agreed,
    the document cannot reasonably be characterised as a contract.   It  is
    no more than a discussion document, albeit that  there  is  provisional
    agreement about some terms which might feature in an  eventual  binding
    contract, such as what will  be  covered  by  "additional  reimbursable
    expenses".

32. Accordingly, since the claimant did not provide a contract showing that
    his business was trading at the  date  of  application,  there  was  no
    breach of paragraph 245AA(b) in the Secretary of State not  giving  the
    claimant  the  opportunity  to  provide  advertising   material   which
    contained his name.  The case worker was  not  obliged  to  afford  the
    claimant this opportunity, as the application fell to be refused in any
    event because the claimant had not provided a contract showing trading.

33. It is open to the claimant to make a fresh application relying  on  new
    evidence of trading.  But his appeal against the refusal decision  must
    fail.  He has not discharged the burden of  proving  that  the  refusal
    decision was wrong, or that the Secretary of State breached  evidential
    flexibility principles in not giving him an opportunity to rectify  the
    omissions in his application before making a decision on it.

Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  contained  an  error  of  law,  and
accordingly the  decision  is  set  aside  and  the  following  decision  is
substituted: the claimant's appeal against the refusal of  leave  to  remain
as a Tier 1 Entrepreneur Migrant is dismissed.

No anonymity direction is made.
