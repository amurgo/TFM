                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction and Background

 1. The Appellant appeals against a decision  of  Judge  A  J  Parker  (the
    Judge) of the First-tier Tribunal (the FTT) promulgated on  29th  April
    2019.

 2. The Appellant is a national of Pakistan born  23rd  October  1990.   He
    appealed to the FTT following  the  Respondent's  decision  dated  14th
    November 2018 to refuse his asylum and human rights claim.

 3. The Appellant's claim was that he would  be  at  risk  if  returned  to
    Pakistan because when he was 16 he was told that he had to  enter  into
    an engagement which he refused.  In December 2008 he  was  attacked  by
    four people as a result of his refusal to enter  into  the  engagement.
    In April 2009 he was again attacked by the  girl's  brother  and  other
    people.  In October 2009 he was  stabbed  by  a  man.   Following  that
    incident he moved to another area of Gujarat.  He  reported  the  first
    two attacks to the police but not the third.  He left Pakistan in March
    2011 and travelled to the UK with leave as a Tier 4 Student.

 4. The Appellant married a British citizen.  There was an Islamic marriage
    in the UK on 4th November 2013 and a registry office marriage  on  20th
    March 2014.

 5. Following the refusal of his claim the Appellant appealed to  the  FTT.
    The judge took the view that the Appellant could not rely upon EX.1.(b)
    of Appendix FM as the Respondent in the refusal decision had found that
    he  did  not  satisfy  the  definition  of   a   partner.    This   was
    notwithstanding that the Appellant had entered  into  a  marriage,  and
    therefore was the spouse of a British citizen.

 6. The judge took the view that this was a new matter that  had  not  been
    considered by the Respondent  and  refused  to  deal  with  it  as  the
    Respondent did not give consent.  The judge refused an application  for
    an adjournment.

 7. The judge heard evidence  from  the  Appellant  and  found  him  to  be
    incredible.  The judge did not accept that the Appellant  would  be  at
    risk if returned to Pakistan.

 8. In the alternative the judge found that the Appellant had a  reasonable
    internal relocation option in Pakistan.

 9. The judge found that the Appellant could not  satisfy  the  Immigration
    Rules in relation  to  having  a  partner  or  child.   Article  8  was
    considered.  The judge accepted the  Appellant  and  his  wife  have  a
    family life.  The judge considered section  117B  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

10. The judge also considered paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) and did not find that
    the Appellant would encounter very significant obstacles to integration
    in Pakistan.

11. In conclusion the judge did not find that there  were  any  exceptional
    circumstances,  and  found   that   the   Respondent's   decision   was
    proportionate.  The appeal was dismissed on all grounds.

The Application for Permission to Appeal

12. In summary it was submitted that the judge had erred  in  finding  that
    the Appellant would not be at risk.  Inadequate reasons had been  given
    for doubting the Appellant's credibility.  The judge should have  found
    that the Appellant is a member of a particular social group.

13. The judge had made an adverse finding because of the Appellant's  delay
    in claiming asylum and it was submitted that he  had  erred  in  making
    this finding.

14. It was submitted that  the  judge  had  given  inadequate  reasons  for
    concluding there was a reasonable internal relocation option.

15. It was submitted that the judge had erred in considering Article 8.  He
    had considered the issue of "very significant obstacles"  very  briefly
    and the judge did not consider the interference with  the  family  life
    that the Appellant and his wife had established.

The Grant of Permission to Appeal

16. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge  Welsh  of  the  FTT  in  the
    following terms;

         "2.  The grounds assert that the judge erred in his  assessment  of
             Article 8, in that he had no regard to the accepted fact  that
             the Appellant was in a relationship with his British  partner.
             The decision states that the Respondent had considered Article
             8 in the context of the Appellant having a  relationship  with
             an unmarried partner, whereas in fact he  is  married  to  the
             woman concerned.  On that basis,  the  judge  found  that  the
             marriage was a new matter and declined to adjourn in order for
             the Article 8 issue to be revisited by the Respondent.

         3.   The judge went on to assess Article 8 and  accepted  that  the
             Appellant enjoys family life  with  his  wife  and  that  this
             family life would be interfered with by his removal.  However,
             it is arguable that the judge failed to assess the  impact  on
             the Appellant's partner and failed to give any reason why  the
             interference with that family life was proportionate.

         4.   Other grounds were pleaded and permission is  granted  on  all
             grounds."

17. Following the grant of permission, directions were  issued  that  there
    should be an oral  hearing  before  the  Upper  Tribunal  to  ascertain
    whether the FTT had erred in law such that the decision should  be  set
    aside.

My Analysis and Conclusions

18. At the oral hearing before me Mr Moksud submitted that  the  judge  had
    erred by failing to consider Appendix FM, and the judge  was  wrong  to
    take the view that the Appellant's marriage to a British national was a
    new matter and he had no jurisdiction to consider it.

19. With reference to asylum Mr Moksud submitted that the  judge  erred  by
    failing to consider whether there was a sufficiency of protection,  and
    failed to adequately consider internal relocation.

20. It was submitted that the judge had erred by failing to  give  adequate
    reasons for finding the Appellant's claim incredible.

21. In addition, with reference to Article 8, the judge had failed to  give
    adequate reasons as to why it was proportionate for the Appellant to be
    removed from the UK.

22. Mr McVeety accepted that the judge had erred in law in relation to  the
    Appellant's marriage.  It was accepted that this was not a  new  matter
    and should not have been regarded as such.  It was not  clear  why  the
    Presenting Officer before the judge would not  consent  to  the  matter
    being dealt with.

23. Mr McVeety submitted that the error was not material  because  had  the
    judge considered EX.1.(b) and insurmountable obstacles,  there  was  no
    evidence  before  him  to  demonstrate  that  insurmountable  obstacles
    existed to family life continuing abroad.   The  Respondent's  position
    was that the FTT decision disclosed no material error of law.

24. I deal firstly with credibility.  I find no material error of law.  The
    judge gave adequate reasons for finding  the  Appellant  incredible  at
    paragraphs 20 - 24.  The judge pointed out that the Appellant had  been
    asked what happened to his fianc�e and he stated that he did  not  know
    although he had been in contact with his parents as recently as  twelve
    months prior  to  the  FTT  hearing.   He  had  not  asked  as  to  her
    whereabouts.  The judge found this incredible, on the  basis  that  the
    Appellant claimed his life was at risk having been  attacked  on  three
    separate occasions and reported two of these attacks to the police.

25. The judge noted that the Appellant had claimed that several members  of
    his former fianc�e's family are members of  the  National  Assembly  in
    Pakistan but there was no evidence to support that contention, and such
    evidence would have been easy to obtain.  There was no medical evidence
    to confirm the Appellant's account of being stabbed or  beaten.   There
    was no evidence of First Information Reports.

26. The judge was entitled and did take into  account  the  fact  that  the
    Appellant  delayed  making  a  claim  for  asylum.   He  made   several
    applications for leave to remain, all of which were refused.   He  made
    no asylum claim.  He was encountered during an immigration  enforcement
    visit in 2016 but made no asylum claim.  In that year he made  a  human
    rights application but did not claim asylum until May 2018.  The  judge
    was entitled to find that the Appellant had not  given  a  satisfactory
    explanation for his delay in claiming asylum.

27. I am satisfied that the judge considered all the evidence in the round,
    although he makes reference to section 8  of  the  2004  Act  prior  to
    setting out his findings on credibility.  It should be remembered  that
    section 8 of the 2004 Act  should  not  be  a  starting  point  for  an
    assessment of credibility.

28. The judge refers to internal relocation briefly, setting out  case  law
    at paragraphs 26 - 27.  He does not then go on to  adequately  consider
    the Appellant's option of internal relocation.  In this case I  do  not
    find this to be a material error because the  primary  finding  by  the
    judge is that the Appellant is not credible and would not be at risk in
    his home area.

29. I do find that the judge erred in law in considering  Article  8.   The
    judge was wrong to find that the  Appellant's  marriage  to  a  British
    citizen should be regarded as a new matter.  This  was  not  the  case.
    The Appellant in his screening interview in  answer  to  question  1.19
    confirmed that he underwent a civil marriage with his  spouse  on  20th
    March 2014.  The screening interview took place on 29th May 2018.

30. The Appellant in his asylum interview, which took place  on  16th  July
    2018 confirmed, in answer to question 11, that he married in the UK  at
    Oldham Registry Office on 20th March 2014.

31. The Respondent in the refusal letter at paragraph  21  noted  that  the
    Appellant claimed to have married in a registry office  on  20th  March
    2014.  It is therefore extremely difficult to understand why, when  the
    Respondent considered the Appellant's  application  under  the  partner
    route at paragraphs 98 - 99 of the refusal letter, that the  conclusion
    was reached that the Appellant did not meet the definition of a partner
    as defined in GEN.1.2 of Appendix FM.  This appears to be on the  basis
    that he had not been living with his partner for  two  years  prior  to
    claiming asylum on 16th May 2018.  There was no need to prove that,  as
    the Appellant and his spouse satisfied  the  definition  by  reason  of
    being married.

32. That error was compounded at the FTT hearing.  The documents before the
    FTT contained the Appellant's marriage certificate.  It  was  therefore
    clearly not a new matter, and should initially have been considered  by
    the Respondent, and should have been considered by the FTT.

33. The judge should have considered EX.1.(b) which for ease of reference I
    set out below;

         "(b) the applicant has a genuine and subsisting relationship with a
             partner who is in the UK and is a British citizen, settled  in
             the UK or  in  the  UK  with  refugee  leave  or  humanitarian
             protection, and there are insurmountable obstacles  to  family
             life with that partner continuing outside the UK."

34. There was no dispute that the Appellant had a  genuine  and  subsisting
    relationship with his spouse, and no dispute  that  she  is  a  British
    citizen.  Insurmountable obstacles are defined in EX.2 which is set out
    below;

         "For the purposes of paragraph EX.1.(b) 'insurmountable  obstacles'
         means the very significant difficulties which would be faced by the
         applicant or their partner in continuing their family life together
         outside the UK and which could not be overcome or would entail very
         serious hardship for the applicant or their partner."

35. As the judge did not  specifically  consider  insurmountable  obstacles
    that is an error of law.  I have to consider whether it is material.

36. I conclude that it was not.   I  make  that  decision  because  I  have
    examined the evidence that was before the judge.  I find nothing in the
    Appellant's witness statement to indicate insurmountable  obstacles  to
    family life continuing outside the UK.  The Appellant's case  was  that
    he would be at risk.  The judge found that not to be the case.

37. I have also examined the witness statement of the Appellant's wife.  In
    relation to insurmountable obstacles she does not make any reference to
    returning to Pakistan with him.  In her witness  statement  she  states
    that they want to live together in the UK, she relies upon him, and  is
    emotionally attached to him,  and  she  could  not  bear  to  think  of
    obstacles that they would be faced with if he was returned to Pakistan.



38. There was no satisfactory evidence before the judge  to  indicate  that
    there would be insurmountable obstacles to the couple continuing family
    life outside the UK.  The Appellant's wife is  a  British  citizen  and
    wishes to remain in  the  UK.   That  does  not  satisfy  the  test  of
    insurmountable obstacles.

39. Therefore, I conclude  that  if  the  judge  had  adopted  the  correct
    approach, the result of the appeal would have been the same,  as  there
    was no satisfactory evidence to indicate the  insurmountable  obstacles
    test was passed.

40. The judge did  consider  public  interest  and  the  considerations  in
    section 117B.   The  judge  also  considered  briefly  but  adequately,
    paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) finding that the Appellant had failed to  prove
    there would  be  very  significant  obstacles  to  his  integration  in
    Pakistan.

41. The judge took into account that the Appellant suffers from generalised
    anxiety disorder and made specific reference to  a  psychiatric  report
    dated 21st August 2018.

42. The judge considered whether the application disclosed any  exceptional
    circumstances and concluded that it did not.  That is a finding open to
    the judge to make on the evidence.

43. In my view the judge was entitled to conclude that the Appellant  would
    not be at risk if returned  to  Pakistan,  and  that  his  removal  was
    proportionate in terms of Article 8, and although there was an error in
    not  adopting  the  correct  approach  and   specifically   considering
    insurmountable obstacles, that error was not material as it  would  not
    have affected the result of the hearing.



Notice of Decision

The decision of the FTT does not disclose the making of a material error  of
law such that the decision must be set  aside.   I  do  not  set  aside  the
decision.  The appeal is dismissed.

No anonymity direction is made.
