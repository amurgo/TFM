                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent

For the Appellant:     Mr J W Bryce, Advocate, instructed by Peter G
Farrell, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr A Govan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, a citizen of Vietnam, has permission to appeal against a
    decision by FtT Judge MacKenzie, promulgated on 31 May 2018, dismissing
    his appeal on protection grounds.  (He did not  rely  on  human  rights
    grounds.)

 2. The appellant's position is  clearly  set  out  in  counsel's  note  of
    argument dated 26 November 2018.  The essence is  that  the  FtT  dealt
    inadequately with an expert report, by Professor Bluth; the FtT  failed
    to make any finding on the contested issue of whether the appellant had
    been a catechist in the Roman  Catholic  Church  in  his  diocese;  the
    expert evidence rendered it inconceivable that if he was  a  catechist,
    he would not have been involved in the Formosa protests,  or  at  least
    the  authorities  would  perceive  him  to  be  involved;  and  such  a
    perception showed a risk of persecution.

 3. Mr Bryce acknowledged that on further background evidence now available
    it was arguable that even if the decision was defective the  claim  "at
    highest" might not succeed.  However, he observed that the respondent's
    decision turned on credibility, implicitly accepting that  there  might
    be risk, and submitted that if there was error, a fresh  hearing  would
    be needed to decide on both subjective and objective fear.

 4. (A second element of the appeal is mentioned in the note,  namely  that
    risk on return as a failed asylum-seeker was  ignored.   However,  this
    was developed no further,  and  it  appears  that  the  appellant  left
    Vietnam on his own passport.  There was nothing to show risk only  from
    failure in an asylum claim.)

 5. Having considered the appellant's written and oral submissions, and the
    submissions for the respondent, I am not persuaded that the  making  of
    the decision of the FtT involved the making of any error on a point  of
    law.

 6. The case turned primarily on the credibility of  the  appellant,  which
    was for the judge to decide.  She was bound to take note of the  expert
    report, but she did so - Mr Govan pointed to [6], [36], [43] and [55].

 7. The judge's main points in assessing credibility were these:

      [38], claim to have circulated articles to  students,  but  unable  to
      remember whether those were published online; vague, and a pointer  to
      fabrication.

      [39] - [40], inability to locate articles claimed to have been  posted
      on church noticeboards and uploaded to the  internet;  vague,  and  no
      explanation for absence of enquiries to trace these articles.

      [41],  claim  in  witness  statement   to   have   published   online,
      contradicted by answers at interview that articles not published.

      [42], oral evidence of usually adopting a different name, contradicted
      by witness statement that he did put his name to journal articles.

      [43], vague and unlikely account of  evading  police  detection;  that
      view reinforced by respondent's CIPIN and report of Professor Bluth.

      [44], unlikelihood of being able to evade police when stopped.

      [45] - [46], contradictions between claim at interview  to  have  gone
      into hiding, and in witness statement to have remained  in  his  small
      village where he was known to the police, plus inadequate  explanation
      in oral evidence, according to which he was not in hiding.

      [47]  No  expert  evidence  to  support  validity  of  summonses;   no
      explanation for originals being produced only on the day of hearing, a
      timing which denied  the  respondent  the  opportunity  to  carry  out
      authentication checks.

      [48] considering all evidence in the round, summonses and  letters  in
      support not found reliable.

      [49] - [54] "for completeness", adverse findings under s.8  2004  act,
      based on delay in claiming, varying explanations for same, and failure
      to claim elsewhere.

 8. The note of argument at [8] criticises [47] of the decision for  taking
    production of original documents as undermining rather  than  enhancing
    credibility.  However, as I  understood  Mr  Bryce  to  accept  at  the
    hearing, the judge's point was not that originals were forthcoming, but
    that they appeared only at the last moment.

 9. None of the other reasons has been said to be defective.

10. The judge separated her findings based on s. 8 of the 2004 Act.  It may
    be an error to find against an appellant on  such  grounds  alone,  but
    they remain part of the  overall  assessment.   However,  the  approach
    taken tended in the appellant's favour, not  against  him.   The  judge
    would have found against him, even apart from those issues, which  were
    strong.

11. The judge's findings are not just statements  of  disbelief,  they  are
    reasoned and comprehensive.  I am not persuaded that  the  decision  is
    defective for absence of an express statement that  the  appellant  had
    not shown that he was  a  catechist.   Judges  do  not  have  to  state
    findings on the evidence line by line.  It has not been suggested  that
    she was asked to make a specific finding, or that it  was  put  to  her
    that the case might succeed by such a finding, and no more.

12. The appellant's case fell well  short  of  probation.   If  a  specific
    finding did need to be read in, it would be negative.

13. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.

14. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
