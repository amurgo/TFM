                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


   1. These are appeals by the Secretary of State with permission granted on
      4 October 2013 against a decision of the First-tier Tribunal (Judge  C
      J Woolley) which allowed each of the claimants' appeals under  Article
      8 of the ECHR.

   2. For convenience hereafter,  I  will  refer  to  the  parties  as  they
      appeared before the First-tier Tribunal.  The appellants are a  family
      and are all citizens of  the  Philippines.  The  first  appellant  and
      second appellant are a married couple born respectively on  28  August
      1969 and 12 November 1968.  The third and fourth appellants are  their
      children who were born respectively on 11 April 2006 and  15  November
      1992.  Both before the First-tier  Tribunal  and  before  me,  it  was
      accepted that the appeals of the second, third and  fourth  appellants
      fell to be determined in line with that of the first appellant.

Introduction

   3. The first appellant is a  "senior  care  worker".    She  entered  the
      United Kingdom with entry clearance as a work  permit  holder  in  May
      2007 and with leave valid from 3 May 2007 until 3 May 2012.  The other
      appellants entered subsequently and were granted leave  in  line  with
      that of the first appellant.  On  2  May  2012,  the  first  appellant
      applied for indefinite leave to remain on the  basis  of  five  years'
      continuous lawful residence in the UK as a work  permit  holder  under
      para 134 of the Immigration Rules (HC 395 as amended).  The Rules  had
      changed since she came to the UK.  The  crucial  requirement  for  the
      appellant was that in para 134(iv)  of  the  Rules  which  is  in  the
      following terms:

           "134.  Indefinite leave may  be  granted  on  application  to  a
           person provided:

           (i) he has spent a continuous period of 5 years lawfully in  the
           UK, of which the most recent period must have been  spent  as  a
           work permit  holder  (under  paragraphs  128  to  133  of  these
           rules)....;

           (iv) his employer certifies that he is  paid  at  or  above  the
           appropriate rate for the job as stated in the Codes of  Practice
           in Appendix J..."

   4. The relevant code for the first appellant's employment  is  Code  6115
      which stipulated that an individual should earn  �7.02  per  hour  and
      that has subsequently risen to �7.80.  The first appellant  could  not
      meet that requirement as the hourly rate she was paid by her employer,
      Oak House Care Home  was  �6.08  an  hour.   Consequently,  the  first
      appellant's application (and those of  the  other  appellants  as  her
      dependents) were refused by the Secretary of State on  19  April  2013
      (first,  second  and  third  appellants)  and  21  May  2013   (fourth
      appellant).

The First-tier Tribunal's Decision

   5.  Before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Mr  Walsh,  who  represented   the
      appellant, conceded that the appellant could not  succeed  under  para
      134 (see para 14 of the determination).  Instead, Mr Walsh relied upon
      Article 8 and the decision of the Upper Tribunal in Philipson (ILR-Not
      PBS: Evidence) India [2012] UKUT 00039 (IAC).  In addition, he  argued
      that the appeal should be allowed on the grounds that the Secretary of
      State's decision was "conspicuously unfair" and that the appellant had
      a legitimate expectation that the Rules would not change to the extent
      that they did so as to disadvantage the appellant.

   6. Judge Woolley did not accept Mr  Walsh's  submission  in  relation  to
      unfairness and legitimate expectation but  found,  applying  what  was
      said  by  the  Upper  Tribunal  in  Philipson,  that  the  refusal  of
      indefinite leave to the first appellant was disproportionate.   It  is
      that latter finding which is challenged by the Secretary of  State  in
      this appeal to the Upper Tribunal.

The Appeal to the UT

   7. The Secretary of State's grounds argue, in  essence,  that  the  Judge
      failed to give any or any adequate weight to the public interest  and,
      in particular to the fact that the first appellant could not meet  the
      requirements of the Immigration Rules which represent an expression of
      the Secretary of  State's  policy  in  controlling  immigration.   The
      grounds argue that Judge Woolley failed to consider whether there were
      "exceptional circumstances" such that a departure from the  new  rules
      was justified.

   8. Both in the rule 24 reply and in his submissions, Mr  Walsh  submitted
      that the Judge  had  correctly  followed  Philipson  in  allowing  the
      appeals under Article 8.  He submitted that the new Immigration  Rules
      were not applicable as the transitional provisions bringing into force
      HC 194 applied.  The appellant's application, having been made  before
      9 July 2012 but decided after  that  date,  was  not  subject  to  the
      application of the new rules, in particular  para  276ADE.   Mr  Walsh
      also submitted, relying upon the Court of Appeal's decision that there
      was no 'hard-edged' test of exceptionality.

   9. In addition, Mr Walsh relied upon the High Court's decision in R (HSMP
      Forum Limited) v SSHD [2008] EWHC 664 (Admin) and submitted  that  the
      first appellant had a legitimate expectation that the Rules would  not
      be applied to her as someone who entered as a work permit holder so as
      to impose the salary requirement in para 134(iv) of  the  Rules  which
      had been introduced since her arrival in the UK.  In  addition,  as  I
      understood his argument, he relied upon a passage  in  the  speech  of
      Lord Neuberger in Odelola v SSHD [2009] UKHL 25 at [57] that it  would
      be unfair, in applying para 134, to apply the  salary  requirement  in
      para 134(iv).

Discussion and Analysis

  10. When the first appellant entered the UK as a work permit holder, there
      was no requirement that she should have  a  stipulated  income.   That
      requirement was introduced in para 134(iv) with effect  from  6  April
      2011 by HC  863.   The  rule  requires  that  the  individual  provide
      evidence from her employer that her rate of pay was equal to  the  sum
      set out in the Tier 2 guidance for the occupation in question.  (There
      was also a change introduced by  para  134  in  the  level  of  skills
      required from 2008 but it is common ground that this does not apply to
      the first appellant).

  11. In Philipson, the Upper Tribunal (Blake J, Chamber President) and  UTJ
      Pitt) concluded at [14] that, as originally introduced  from  6  April
      2011, para 134(iv) could not apply to an individual (such as the first
      appellant) who had come to the UK under the  old  work  permit  scheme
      rather than under the new PBS one.  That was because there was, in the
      words of Blake J:

           "No guidance as to the salary level applicable to her, then rule
           134(iv) would not apply and her claim to settlement should  have
           been granted without more."

  12. That also was common ground between the parties before me.

  13. That, however, changed from 4 April 2012 when the Secretary  of  State
      changed her policy such that the salary requirements  now  applied  to
      those (such as the first appellant) who came to the UK as work  permit
      holders.  That is recorded in a letter from the UKBA dated 4 July 2013
      addressed to  the  Royal  College  of  Nursing  (at  Tab  C96  of  the
      appellant's bundle).  There, it is set out that it was  the  Secretary
      of State's policy that the appropriate salary  rate  should  apply  to
      work permit holders but "due to a technical omission" in  the  wording
      of the Code of Practice that policy was not given effect  immediately.
      The letter continues:

           "To address this technical error, the wording was changed  on  4
           April 2012 to include all applications from SCWs from that date.
            In recognition of the previous error, we waved the  requirement
           to be paid �7.02 per hour for applications  submitted  before  4
           April 2012.  As this waiver only related to a  small  number  of
           cases already submitted,  and  was  not  available  to  any  new
           applicants, it was decided  not  to  publish  details  to  avoid
           confusion."

  14. The final comment in that paragraph is perhaps surprising.

  15. Consequently, the first appellant's position was that had she  applied
      prior to 4 April 2012, in the light of the view expressed in  [14]  of
      Philipson, the first appellant would  not  have  had  to  satisfy  the
      requirement of para 134(iv).   She  would,  of  course,  have  had  to
      establish under para 134(i) that she had been in the UK  lawfully  for
      five years as a work permit holder and that she could  not  have  done
      until 3 May 2012.  Nevertheless, on the assumption (not  unreasonably)
      that an application made shortly before 4  April  2012  would  not  be
      decided until after 3 May 2012 had the first appellant  made  such  an
      application it would  undoubtedly  have  been  successful.    However,
      because she made her application on 2 May 2012 the "lacuna" caused  by
      the technical omission did not apply to her and hence, given that  she
      was paid less than �7.02 per hour she  could  not  succeed  under  the
      Rules.

      Legitimate Expectation

  16. Although it is raised by way of reply by Mr Walsh, I will  deal  first
      with his argument that the first appellant should  have  succeeded  on
      the basis that she had a legitimate expectation that the  Rules  would
      not be amended adversely so as to prevent her, after five years lawful
      residence as a work permit holder, being able  to  successfully  apply
      for indefinite leave.

  17. The normal position is  that,  as  expressions  of  the  Secretary  of
      State's policy, the Immigration Rules maybe changed using the negative
      resolution procedure in the House of Commons at  any  time  and  that,
      subject to transitional arrangements, an individual's  application  is
      to be determined by the Rules in force at the date of the Secretary of
      State's decision.  That is the position affirmed by the House of Lords
      in Odelola.  In Odelola, the House of Lords rejected the argument that
      an individual had a vested  right  which  entitled  them  to  have  an
      application under the Rules decided on the basis of the Rules in force
      at the date of application.  At [39], Lord Brown said this:

           "...I have no doubt that the changes in the  Immigration  Rules,
           unless they specify to the contrary, take effect  whenever  they
           say that they take effect with regard to  all  applications  for
           leave, those pending no less than those yet to be made."

  18. I did not understand Mr Walsh to dispute this proposition.  It  means,
      in my judgement, in principle that the first  appellant  in  order  to
      succeed under the Immigration Rules had to meet all  the  requirements
      of para 134 including the salary requirement in para  134(iv).   There
      were no transitional provisions applicable  to  her.   What  Mr  Walsh
      submits is that by way of exception  to  that  proposition  the  first
      appellant can show that she (as a person who entered as a work  permit
      holder) has a legitimate expectation that the  rule  will  not  change
      unfavourably to her, in particular, by imposing the salary requirement
      in para 134(iv).  Mr Walsh relies upon the  HSMP  Forum  Limited  case
      and, in his submissions, drew my attention in particular to paras [52]-
      [54] of the judgement of the High Court.

  19. There, the High Court was  concerned  with  a  change  in  the  Highly
      Skilled Migrant scheme which resulted in changes which reduced or took
      away an individual's opportunity to apply for settlement (that is  ILR
      under the scheme).  To that extent, the case has similarities with the
      present one.  However, the basis upon which the  High  Court  accepted
      that the legitimate expectation relied upon in the HSMP Forum  Limited
      case was established, is drawn out in paras [55] and [56] as follows:

           "55.  But the guidance went further.  The January 2002  guidance
                 stated that even if the programme was suspended:

                       "those already in  the  United  Kingdom,  as  Skilled
                       Migrants,  will  continue   to   benefit   from   the
                       programme's provisions."

                 The later guidance stated in answer to the  question  "What
                 if  the  scheme  changes?"  and  "I  have  already  applied
                 successfully under the HSMP.  How  does  the  revised  HSMP
                 affect me?"

                       "A. Not at all.  It is important to  note  that  once
                       you have entered under the programme  you  are  in  a
                       category that has an avenue to settlement.  Those who
                       have already entered under the HSMP will  be  allowed
                       to stay and  apply  for  settlement  after  4  years'
                       qualifying  residence  regardless  of  revisions   to
                       HSMP."

           56.   It can  be  said  (indeed  it  was  emphasised)  that  the
                 revisions  did  not  touch  the  extension  and  settlement
                 criteria and that that statement cannot be read as applying
                 to such revisions. I am  not  so  much  influenced  by  the
                 reference to "revisions" as I am by the "important ...note"
                 in general terms: "...once you have entered... you are in a
                 category that has an avenue to settlement".  This seems  to
                 me to accurately describe the character and intended manner
                 of operation of the scheme."

  20. At [57] Sir George Newman concluded:

           "57.  I find that the terms of the scheme, properly  interpreted
                 in context and  read  with  the  guidance  and  the  rules,
                 contain a clear representation, made by the defendant, that
                 once a migrant had embarked on the scheme  he  would  enjoy
                 the  benefits  of  the  scheme  according  to   the   terms
                 prevailing at the date he joined.

  21. In the HSMP Forum Limited case, the legitimate expectation  was  based
      upon both the context and statements made in guidance (set out at [55]
      of the judgement) which, in effect, promised to those who had  entered
      under the old scheme that changes would not affect  their  "avenue  to
      settlement".  Mr Walsh has not pointed  to  any  such  statement  made
      either to the  first  appellant  or  more  generally  to  work  permit
      holders.  A legitimate expectation requires, in the words  of  Bingham
      LJ in R v IRC Ex part MFK Underwriting Agents  Limited  [1990]  1  WLR
      1545 at 1569G-H that:

           "the  ruling  or  statement  relied  upon   should   be   clear,
           unambiguous and devoid of relevant qualification."

  22. That approach was affirmed by the Privy Council in Paponett and Others
      v Attorney General of Trinidad and Tobago [2010] UKPC 32 at  [28]-[30]
      per Lord Dyson.

  23.  No  such  clear,  unequivocal  and  unambiguous  statement  has  been
      identified or relied upon in this appeal.

  24. As regards 'context', identified as an important factor  in  the  HSMP
      Forum Limited case, Mr Walsh candidly accepted that Sir George  Newman
      at [33]-[35] of the HSMP Forum Limited put the position of work permit
      holders in a less favourable category as regards settlement.  At [34],
      Sir George Newman said:

           "34.  In my judgement, leave to remain pursuant to a Work Permit
                 cannot be compared favourably with the individual migration
                 route which is available to those under the HSMP. "

  25. At [36] he refers to the work permit scheme as "a  significantly  less
      advantageous scheme".  At [33], Sir George Newman remarked that:

           "33.  Whilst families can reside with the  holder  of  the  work
                 permit, the status  carries  considerable  uncertainty  and
                 potential for disruption to family life."

  26. In my judgement, Judge Woolley was entirely correct to  conclude  that
      the appellant could  not  succeed  on  the  basis  of  establishing  a
      "legitimate expectation" such that the first appellant  could  succeed
      in her claim for ILR despite the change in para 134(iv).

      Fairness

  27. Whilst Mr Walsh sought to rely, as he had for Judge Woolley, upon  the
      notion of "conspicuous unfairness", in my judgement that is properly a
      matter to be considered in the application of Article 8.   Mr  Walsh's
      reliance upon [57] of the speech of Lord Neuberger in Odelola  cannot,
      in my judgement, demonstrate that Judge  Woolley  erred  in  law.   At
      [57], Lord Neuberger said this:

           "57.  The notion that the unfairness of a change  in  the  Rules
                 applying to existing applications can be taken into account
                 when deciding if they do so apply, even if no vested  right
                 is involved is also supported  by  a  passage,  cited  with
                 approval in Wilson [2004] 1 AC  816,  para  200,  from  the
                 judgment of Staughton LJ in Secretary of State  for  Social
                 Security v Tunnicliffe [1991] 2 All ER 712, 724.   He  said
                 that it was  "not  simply  a  question  of  classifying  an
                 enactment as retrospective or not retrospective", but  that
                 "it may well be a  matter  of  degree  -  the  greater  the
                 unfairness, the more it is to be expected  that  Parliament
                 will make it clear if that is intended".  The fact that the
                 weight to be given to the presumption varies  in  this  way
                 assists the conclusion that one can take into  account  the
                 fairness  of  the  result  when  considering   whether   an
                 amendment applies to existing applications, even  where  no
                 vested right is involved."

  28. Mr Walsh cannot have it both ways.  He clearly accepted  before  Judge
      Woolley that the appeal could not be allowed under para 134 (see  para
      14 of the determination).  As a free standing method  of  interpreting
      the application of para 134(iv), therefore, Mr Walsh cannot  now  rely
      upon unfairness so as to identify an error in the judgement such  that
      the appeal should have been allowed as  not  in  accordance  with  the
      Immigration Rules under which, it was accepted before  Judge  Woolley,
      the first appellant could not  succeed.   In  any  event,  beyond  the
      'legitimate expectation' argument, I am unable to see any  conspicuous
      unfairness  or,  indeed,  any  basis  upon  which  para  134  can   be
      interpreted so as to exclude its application to the first appellant.

  29. Consequently, the crucial  issue  in  this  appeal  is  whether  Judge
      Woolley's decision allowing the appeal under Article 8 can stand.

      Article 8

  30. The Judge dealt at length  with  Article  8  at  paras  32-37  of  his
      determination.   He  accepted  that  the  appellants  had  established
      private and family  life  in  the  UK.   However,  as  they  would  be
      returning to the Philippines as a family there would be no  breach  of
      their family life but, he found, that over the "last  six  years"  the
      appellants have "put down considerable roots" and that  their  removal
      engaged Article 8.1.  No challenge is brought to that finding.

  31. Having found that any interference would be in accordance with the law
      (para 35) and that the removal would be for a legitimate aim, at  para
      37 Judge Woolley dealt with the issue of proportionality.  In para  37
      he noted that:

           "There  is  no  requirement  for  me  to  apply  any   test   of
           'exceptionality' but rather to 'strike a  fair  balance  between
           the rights of the individual and the interest of  the  community
           which is inherent in the whole of the Convention".

  32. That self direction is entirely in accordance with the Article 8  case
      law, in particular Razgar v SSHD [2004] UKHL24 and Huang v SSHD [2007]
      UKHL 11.  In  finding  that  the  interference  with  the  appellant's
      private life would be disproportionate, Judge Woolley  relied  heavily
      upon the Upper Tribunal's decision in Philipson.  Judge Woolley  first
      set out from [20] of the Upper Tribunal's determination as follows:

           "20.  ...there was in our judgment private life  established  in
                 this country when the claimant and her family had relocated
                 from India on the understanding and  belief  that  she  was
                 being admitted under a rule what would allow them to remain
                 indefinitely in the United Kingdom.  She had an expectation
                 of permanent residence in the UK if she continued  to  meet
                 the conditions of the work permit.  In our  judgement  that
                 was a legitimate and reasonable one having  regard  to  the
                 nature of the rules throughout her stay.  Although  it  was
                 not a legal right or an  indefeasible  expectation  because
                 policy  could  always  change,  we  would  normally  expect
                 transitional provisions to be made in the in cases where  a
                 person is encouraged to leave their own country to take  on
                 a demanding and very low paid job as a care assistant.   In
                 our judgment, there was private and family  life  deserving
                 of respect.  The question then arises whether  interference
                 with it is justified and proportionate."

  33. Then, quoting from  [24]  of  the  Upper  Tribunal's  decision,  Judge
      Woolley continued:

           "24.  It is trite law that a measure may be  a  disproportionate
                 interference with a human right if the decision  maker  has
                 not adopted an alternative means of promoting the aim  that
                 is less intrusive on the right: see for example SSHD v Daly
                 [2001] UKHL 26; [2001] 2 AC 532 at [27]. "

  34. Judge Woolley then continued:

           "I have found that the Article 8 rights of the appellant and her
           dependents are engaged.  The legitimate public end is identified
           is the maintenance of a firm and orderly immigration  policy  so
           as to protect the economic and social  fabric  of  the  country.
           Against this must be weighed the rights of the appellant and her
           dependents to the private life which they have established since
           their arrival in the United Kingdom.  I have accepted that  this
           private life is of long standing and is very considerable.   The
           appellant has  performed,  and  continues  to  perform,  a  very
           valuable role n the community  in  helping  to  look  after  the
           elderly.  I accept that there is a shortage of skilled carers in
           this field, not least because of the very low  wages  on  offer.
           Although she does not meet the required wage under the code  she
           has always met the minimum wage conditions.  I quote  the  words
           of the President in Philipson which are  equally  apposite  here
           "having admitted her at a certain wage  level  and  led  her  to
           believe that settlement was probable at the end of the five year
           period, it is very harsh to  refuse  her  because  of  a  recent
           change of policy that operated on employers and  not  employees.
           A less intrusive  means  of  promoting  the  legitimate  aim  of
           maintaining reasonable wage levels in the industry would  be  to
           require the employer to  improve  the  wage  or  to  permit  the
           appellant to  move  to  another  employer  willing  to  pay  the
           increased  wage".   It  is  in  this  respect  that  Mr  Walsh's
           submissions have their full force.  The  Home  Office,  somewhat
           astonishingly, have admitted that the rule change was  not  made
           public because of the likely confusion it might cause.  Had  the
           proposed rule change been published in  advance,  however,  then
           the steps which the President  has  mentioned  could  have  been
           planned and prepared for so as to allow the  appellant  to  meet
           the wage requirements.  I have no doubt that as  an  experienced
           carer that the appellant would have found employment paying  the
           wage of �7.80 an hour, particularly if she was working up to the
           grade of senior carer, or that her employers would not have been
           prepared to raise her wages to this level if they had wanted  to
           keep her.  I find that the interference with the private life of
           the appellant and her  dependents  is  disproportionate  to  the
           legitimate aim identified.  I find that the  second,  third  and
           fourth appellants are entitled to be classed as  her  dependents
           and that the private life of them all is involved if the private
           life of the first  appellant  is  breached.   I  find  that  the
           balance comes down in favour of  their  rights  as  against  the
           principle of legitimate immigration control as applying in  this
           case in furtherance of the economic and social wellbeing of  the
           United  Kingdom.   I  find  that  the  interference   with   the
           appellants' rights to a private life is of such a  level  as  to
           breach those rights."

  35. The facts of Philipson were strikingly similar to those of the present
      appeals.  There, as in these appeals, the claimant was admitted  under
      a work permit valid for five years and throughout nearly the whole  of
      her stay in the UK para 134 was  in  terms  such  that  she  would  be
      entitled to indefinite leave to remain after five years.  However, one
      month before the conclusion of the five year  period,  the  settlement
      requirements in para 134 were amended to impose a  "novel  requirement
      of a wage that met the minimum set out in guidance to Tier 2 Sponsors"
      ([16] of Philipson).   At [17], Blake J commented:

           "17.  The intrinsic lack of justice in this case comes from  the
                 attempt at the 59th month of her 60 month stay,  to  impose
                 wage conditions on her that were irrelevant to the original
                 grant of the work permit."

  36. In fact, in Philipson the  Upper  Tribunal  allowed  that  appellant's
      appeal under para 134 on the basis of evidence  that  the  appellant's
      employer had backdated a rise in her wages that met the requirement in
      para 134(iv).  The Upper Tribunal, as a result, specifically indicated
      that it did not need to make any decision on that appellant's  Article
      8 claim.  However, the Upper Tribunal gave a clear indication  of  the
      approach that should be adopted in cases of this sort.   At  [22]  the
      Upper Tribunal said this:

           "22.  ...Controlling immigration is  not  a  legitimate  aim  in
                 itself but is certainly a means to protecting the  economic
                 and social order and the rights of others.   However  there
                 was nothing  in  the  immigration  rules  or  generally  to
                 suggest that the claimant or her family threatened economic
                 or social disorder or did not qualify for settlement."

  37. Then at [24] the Upper Tribunal dealt with  the  situation  where  the
      individual could not  show  that  she  met  the  wage  requirement  as
      follows:

           "24.  Even if her  employer  had  refused  a  wage  increase  or
                 refused to back-date it to the period before  the  decision
                 of the Secretary of State in question, we would have wanted
                 to explore with some care whether there  was  a  legitimate
                 aim for refusing her application.  She  met  the  statutory
                 minimum  wage  conditions.   She  had  performed  and   was
                 continuing to perform a valuable social service in a  field
                 of employment in which there  are  labour  force  shortages
                 given the low level of wages.  Having  admitted  her  at  a
                 certain wage level and led her to believe  that  settlement
                 was probable at the end of the five year period, it is very
                 harsh to refuse her because of a recent  change  of  policy
                 that operated  on  employers  and  not  employees.  A  less
                 intrusive  means  of  promoting  the  legitimate   aim   of
                 maintaining reasonable wage levels in the industry would be
                 to require the employer to improve the wage  or  to  permit
                 the appellant to move to an another employer willing to pay
                 the increased wage."

  38. That was the reasoning, of course,  that  Judge  Woolley  adopted  and
      applied to these appellants so as to conclude that  the  Secretary  of
      State's decision  was  not  proportionate.   In  my  judgement,  Judge
      Woolley was fully entitled to apply what was  said  in  Philipson  and
      reach the conclusion that he did.  The balance that he struck  against
      the Secretary of State  and  in  favour  of  the  appellants  was  not
      irrational or otherwise unlawful.

  39. That said, I must deal with the grounds relied  upon  by  Mr  Richards
      and, in particular, the argument that the Judge erred in  law  because
      he did not take into account that the appellant  could  not  meet  the
      requirements of the "new" Article 8 rules and did not apply a test  of
      "exceptional circumstances".

  40. The argument that the Judge was required to apply the  new  Article  8
      rule is, in my judgement, untenable.  It is accepted  by  Mr  Richards
      that the Rules cannot be directly  applied  in  this  case.   That  is
      because the first appellant's application was made before 9 July  2012
      and so, by virtue of the transitional provisions, the  new  rules  did
      not apply.  That is, presumably, why the Secretary of  State  did  not
      seek to apply the new rule in her decision letters in respect of  each
      of the appellants.  Nevertheless, it is said by Mr  Richards  that  at
      the date of the  hearing  before  Judge  Woolley  the  new  rules  did
      represent the Secretary of State's policy in  relation  to  Article  8
      and, in particular, respect for private life and, therefore, had to be
      taken into account by the First-tier Tribunal in  determining  whether
      the public interest outweighed the  private  life  of  the  appellant.
      With respect, that in my judgement directly contradicts the purpose of
      the transitional provisions.  The Secretary of State  cannot,  on  the
      one hand say that the Rules should not be applied and,  on  the  other
      hand state that they reflect her policy on Article 8 and are therefore
      relevant  in  the  proportionality   assessment.    The   transitional
      provisions mean that the "new" rules dealing  with  Article  8  issues
      simply were not the applicable policy of the  Secretary  of  State  in
      applications made before 9 July 2012 but decided after that date.   I,
      therefore, reject the argument that the  Judge  should  consider  (and
      indirectly apply) the new rules, in particular in these  appeals  para
      276ADE, in assessing proportionality.

  41. In any event, even if that  is  not  correct,  I  do  not  accept  the
      argument  that  the  Judge  was  required  to  apply  an  "exceptional
      circumstances" test.  As  the  Court  of  Appeal  makes  plain  in  MF
      (Nigeria) v SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ 1192 at [44]:

           "We would, therefore, hold that the new  rules  are  a  complete
           code and that the exceptional circumstances to be considered  in
           the  balancing  exercise   involved   the   application   of   a
           proportionality   test   as   required   by    the    Strasbourg
           jurisprudence.  We accordingly and  respectfully  do  not  agree
           with the  UT  that  the  decision  maker  is  not  "mandated  or
           directed"  to  take  all  relevant  Article  8   criteria   into
           account......"

  42. The point being made is that, even where  the  new  rules  apply,  the
      requirement of "exceptional circumstances",  whether  in  relation  to
      deportation and found in para 399 or in other cases by virtue  of  the
      Secretary of State's policy (see  R(Nagre)  v  SSHD  [2013]  EWHC  720
      (Admin)), does no  more  than  reflect  the  proportionality  exercise
      mandated by the Strasbourg case law.  It was, of  course,  that  which
      was applied by the Upper Tribunal in Philipson and by Judge Woolley in
      this appeal.   In  other  words,  the  Secretary  of  State  may  have
      enshrined her policy in the new rules  but  that  does  no  more  than
      manifest in that form the factors relevant  to,  and  the  process  of
      assessment inherent under, Article 8.2.

  43. Further, it is not entirely clear what real weight could  be  attached
      to the fact that the appellant did not meet the requirements  of  para
      276ADE as they had only been in the UK for five years.  The new  rules
      simply do not deal with the particularity  of  the  first  appellant's
      claim, like that in Philipson,  based  upon  the  "intrinsic  lack  of
      justice", it was that "injustice" (or "unfairness" as Mr Walsh put it)
      which informed the approach of the Upper  Tribunal  in  Philipson  and
      Judge Woolley in this appeal.

  44. In my judgement, Judge  Woolley  properly  directed  himself  and  was
      entitled to conclude that, in  the  particular  circumstances  of  the
      appellants   the   interference   with   their   private   life    was
      disproportionate.  The suggestion in the grounds  that  Judge  Woolley
      wrongly took  into  account  as  "determinative"  the  fact  that  the
      Secretary of State had delayed by one year in reaching a  decision  on
      the first appellant's application is, with respect, without merit.  It
      is clear on reading para 36 that, consistent with EB (Kosovo)  v  SSHD
      [2008] UKHL 41, Judge  Woolley  took  into  account  that  delay  (not
      attributable to the appellant) had resulted in "deeper  roots  in  the
      community than otherwise" and that this will "strengthen an Article  8
      claim".

Decision

  45. For these reasons, the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  to  allow
      the appellants' appeals under Article 8 did not involve the making  of
      an error of law.  The First-tier Tribunal's decisions stand.

  46. The Secretary of  State's  appeal  to  this  Tribunal  is,  therefore,
      dismissed.
