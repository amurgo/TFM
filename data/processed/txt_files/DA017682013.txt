Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr McVeety, a Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Holt, instructed by M A Consultants (London)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant is a citizen of India who was born on 18th October,  1987
    and who entered the United Kingdom with entry clearance  as  a  working
    holidaymaker valid from 6th November, 2007 until  6th  November,  2008.
    On 12th June, 2009, he was successful in  obtaining  a  certificate  of
    approval to marry a British citizen, but the marriage did not  proceed.



Immigration history

2.   On 30th October, 2009, he applied for leave to  remain  as  a  student,
    but that leave application was refused on 3rd December, 2009.  He  made
    a further application for the same purpose on 6th  January,  2010,  but
    that application was also refused on 12th June, 2010, this time with no
    right of appeal.  On 28th September, 2010, he applied for a certificate
    of approval to marry a Portuguese national, but this was refused on 6th
    April, 2011.  On 27th July, 2011 he was served  with  notice  informing
    him of his liability for removal as an overstayer and requiring him  to
    report on 11th August, 2011.

3.   On 14th October, 2011 his Portuguese spouse  submitted  an  application
    for an EEA residence permit  and  the  appellant  applied  for  an  EEA
    residence card as her spouse.  Both applications were rejected on  27th
    October, 2011, because the spouse had failed to  provide  any  evidence
    that she was exercising treaty rights.

4.   A further application  was  made  on  28th  November,  2011  and  these
    applications were granted on 23rd May, 2012.  The respondent was issued
    with a residence card as the dependant of an EEA national  valid  until
    3rd May, 2017.

The deportation order

5.   At Manchester Crown Court on 10th January,  2013,  the  respondent  was
    convicted of conspiring to do an act to facilitate the commission of  a
    breach of the United Kingdom Immigration Law by a non-EU  national  and
    on 6th March, 2013, he was sentenced to fifteen  months'  imprisonment.
    He did not appeal.

7.    By letter of 27th March, 2013, served on him on 15th April, 2013,  the
    appellant was notified of his liability to deportation.  The  appellant
    made a claim to asylum on 15th May, 2013 which he subsequently withdrew
    on 25th June, 2013.  A deportation order was made on 30th July, 2013.

The decision of the First Tier Tribunal

8.   The respondent appealed  the  decision  to  make  a  deportation  order
    against him to a panel of the First-tier Tribunal comprising First-tier
    Tribunal Judge M Davies and Mrs S A Hussain.  They allowed  the  appeal
    ion a determination promulgated on 10th December, 2013, following which
    appellant applied for permission to appeal against that decision  which
    was granted on 8th January, 2014.

Error of law

9.   On 5th March, 2014 I found that the panel of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    had erred in law because, given the convictions of the  respondent  and
    his wife, it was necessary of the panel to state  clearly  with  cogent
    reasons why they had concluded that the marriage between the  appellant
    and his wife was genuine and they failed to do so.

10.  The panel referred at paragraph 35 of their determination  to  evidence
    which showed that the parties had both formed  the  intention  to  live
    together permanently and they say that that is supported by  "extensive
    evidence from a large number of people confirming" the  genuineness  of
    the marriage, but they do not say what that evidence consisted  of  and
    nowhere in their determination do they refer to any of  the  "extensive
    evidence from a large number of people".  On  5th  March,  2014  I  set
    aside the First-tier Tribunal's determination.

11.  The matter came for hearing before me today 22nd September, 2014,  when
    the  respondents  were  represented  by  Mr  Holt  instructed  by  M  A
    Consultants (London) and the appellant was represented by Mr McVeety  a
    Senior Home Office Presenting Officer.

12.  Unfortunately Mr McVeety was  in  some  considerable  pain  having  two
    slipped discs. He was in no position to continue  with  a  hearing.  Mr
    Holt had no objections to the hearing being adjourned in  view  of  the
    Home Office Presenting Officer's indisposition.

13.  Mr McVeety and Mr Holt both agreed that in the circumstances and  given
    the delay that has already occurred and the likelihood of further delay
    before the matter can be relisted again before me,  the  most  sensible
    course would be for this matter to be remitted under paragraph 7 of the
    Senior President's Practice Statement to the  First-tier  Tribunal  for
    hearing before  a  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  other  than  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Davies.

5.   In the circumstances I have decided that it  is  appropriate  to  remit
    this appeal to the First-tier Tribunal.  If it  is  felt  necessary  to
    have a panel hearing then the panel should  comprise  of  a  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge other than M Davies and a lay member other than Mrs S  A
    Hussain otherwise it is simply necessary to list the  matter  before  a
    judge other than Mr M Davies.  The  respondent  will  need  a  Gujarati
    interpreter, there will be two  witnesses  and  the  matter  should  be
    listed for three hours.
