                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. The appellant is a national of Malawi and presently aged 42.

 2. Her appeal on international protection and human rights (articles 3 and
    8) grounds was initially heard by the First-tier  Tribunal  sitting  at
    Bradford and refused by a decision dated 27 November 2019.

 3. The appellant appealed to the Upper Tribunal on  human  rights  grounds
    alone. She was granted permission to appeal, and by a decision dated  4
    November 2020 I set aside the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal.  In
    doing so I observed, inter alia, at �16 of my decision:

         '16. With his usual candour, Mr. Tufan conceded on  behalf  of  the
            respondent that in light of the recent judgment of  the  Supreme
            Court  in  AM  (Zimbabwe)  the  Judge's  consideration  of   the
            appellant's article 3 and 8 rights at para. 42 was  insufficient
            in terms of consideration. He confirmed that the respondent  did
            not oppose the setting aside of the decision of  the  First-tier
            Tribunal, though he observed that the respondent did not  accept
            that the objective evidence relied upon by  the  appellant  came
            close to meeting the burden placed upon her.'

 4. I directed that the decision be remade by this Tribunal  and  confirmed
    that the findings of fact made by the First-tier Tribunal  in  relation
    to the international protection claim, at ��25-41, were  preserved  and
    the findings of fact made in respect of the article 8 claim,  at  ��42-
    45, were set aside.

 5. In not proceeding with  the  remaking  of  the  decision  at  the  last
    hearing, I acceded to the appellant's  request  to  be  given  time  to
    secure and file further evidence.

Hearing

 6. The hearing before me was a Skype for Business video conference hearing
    held during the Covid-19 pandemic. I was present in a hearing  room  at
    Field House. The hearing room and the building were open to the public.
    The hearing and its start time were listed in the  cause  list.  I  was
    addressed by the representatives in exactly the same way as if we  were
    together in the hearing room. I am satisfied: that this  constituted  a
    hearing in open  court;  that  the  open  justice  principle  has  been
    secured; that no party has been prejudiced; and that, insofar as  there
    has been any restriction on a right or interest,  it  is  justified  as
    necessary and proportionate.

 7. The appellant attended the hearing remotely.

Anonymity

 8. By means of my decision dated 4 November  2020,  I  made  an  anonymity
    direction and  detailed  my  reasons.  Neither  party  sought  for  the
    direction to be set aside, and so I confirm it  at  the  conclusion  of
    this decision. I do so in order to avoid a likelihood of  serious  harm
    arising to the appellant from the contents of her  human  rights  claim
    becoming publicly known, in particular the nature of her illness.

Facts

 9. The appellant first arrived in this country on 7 July 2002  with  valid
    entry clearance as a student and was granted leave to  enter  until  31
    August 2003. She made subsequent applications to vary her  leave  as  a
    student and enjoyed leave to remain until 31 August 2005. At an unknown
    date in 2005 she returned to  Malawi  and  subsequently  secured  entry
    clearance as a student. She returned to this country in September  2005
    and was granted leave to enter until 31 August 2007.

10. In 2006 the appellant was hospitalised and  subsequently  diagnosed  as
    HIV+. She has since regularly received antiretroviral treatment for her
    condition.

11. She completed treatment for a Stage 4B diffuse large B cell lymphoma in
    2013 which required intensive care treatment. She underwent a  surgical
    operation where a tumour was removed from her spinal-cord.

12. The appellant still has her 'Ommaya reservoir shunt' - a soft, plastic,
    dome-shaped device that is placed under the scalp - in situ as  advised
    by neurosurgeons for use in case of any future relapses. She  initially
    had significant neurological disability due to spinal  involvement  but
    has made considerable recovery. Whilst  receiving  treatment  for  this
    condition she developed further complications of CMV  retinitis,  where
    the retina of an eye is inflammed, and peripheral neuropathy  which  is
    still ongoing. Though she is independently mobile she confirmed  to  me
    that she requires the use of a walking stick.

13. She continues to attend follow-up consultations in  the  ophthalmology,
    haematology and HIV departments of her local hospital  for  appropriate
    health management.

14. In October 2013 she claimed  asylum.  The  claim  was  refused  by  the
    respondent consequent a decision dated 30 January 2015 and certified as
    clearly unfounded under section 94 of the Nationality, Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002.

15. She served further representations on asylum and human  rights  grounds
    dated 3 June 2016. Subsequent representations were served  under  cover
    of a letter dated 19 June 2018. By a decision dated 23 March  2019  the
    respondent accepted the representations as constituting a  fresh  claim
    under paragraph 353 of the Immigration Rules.

16. In 2018 the appellant was diagnosed with saddle pulmonary  embolism,  a
    form of  large  pulmonary  thrombo-embolism  that  straddles  the  main
    pulmonary arterial trunk at  its  bifurcation,  and  she  is  presently
    prescribed anticoagulant medication.

17. By a decision dated 27 November 2019, Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal
    Kelly  dismissed  the  appellant's  appeal.  For  the  purpose  of   my
    consideration of the human  rights  appeal  before  me,  the  following
    findings of fact made by Judge Kelly are preserved:

          . The appellant provided a truthful account  of  the  core  events
            that occurred prior to her departure from Malawi but exaggerated
            the extent to which those events genuinely caused  her  to  fear
            her return: [32] of decision.


          . She spent her formative years in Malawi: [38]


          . She retains significant social, family and cultural  connections
            to Malawi: [39]


          . It would be reasonable for her to relocate to an area away  from
            her husband in order to avoid the small  risk  to  her  personal
            safety: [41]


Decision

Article 3

18. In respect of 'medical health cases' concerning article 3 ECHR and  the
    removal of a foreign national from a Member State, the Grand Chamber of
    the Strasbourg Court held in Paposhvili v. Belgium (App. No.  41738/10)
    [2017] Imm AR 867 that the inferiority  of  health  facilities  in  the
    receiving state is not of itself an exceptional circumstance,  and  nor
    is the fact that an individual's life expectancy would be significantly
    reduced by removal. Very exceptional cases are those which involve  the
    removal of seriously ill persons where there  are  substantial  grounds
    for believing that, although death is not imminent, they would  face  a
    real risk of a serious, rapid and irreversible decline in their  health
    resulting in intense suffering or to a significant  reduction  in  life
    expectancy due to a lack of access  to  appropriate  treatment  in  the
    receiving country.

19. The Supreme Court confirmed in AM (Zimbabwe) v. Secretary of State  for
    the Home Department [2020] UKSC 17, [2020] 2 WLR 1152 that  in  respect
    of article 3 it remains the basic principle that it is for  the  person
    alleging a breach of rights to  establish  it.  However,  in  expulsion
    cases concerned with the provision of health care the general principle
    has been modified. The threshold now is that an appellant is to  adduce
    evidence 'capable of demonstrating that there are  substantial  grounds
    for believing' that their  article  3  rights  would  be  violated.  As
    confirmed by the Supreme Court this is a  demanding  threshold  for  an
    appellant  to  cross.  The  evidence  adduced  by  the  appellant  must
    demonstrate substantial  grounds  for  believing  that  they  would  be
    exposed to a real risk of  being  subjected  to  inhuman  treatment  if
    removed.

20. It therefore follows that there is an obligation upon the appellant  in
    this matter to raise a prima facie case of  potential  infringement  of
    her article 3 rights before evidential obligations are placed upon  the
    respondent. As to a prima facie case, the Court in Paposhvili confirmed
    at [186]

         '186. In the context of these procedures, it is for the  applicants
             to adduce evidence capable  of  demonstrating  that  there  are
             substantial  grounds  for  believing  that,  if   the   measure
             complained of were to be implemented, they would be exposed  to
             a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article
             3 (see Saadi, cited above, � 129, and  F.G.  v.  Sweden,  cited
             above, � 120). In this connection it should be observed that  a
             certain degree of speculation is  inherent  in  the  preventive
             purpose of Article 3 and that it is not a matter  of  requiring
             the persons concerned to provide clear  proof  of  their  claim
             that they would be exposed to  proscribed  treatment  (see,  in
             particular, Trabelsi v. Belgium, no. 140/10, � 130,  ECHR  2014
             (extracts)).'

21. Upon the appellant presenting evidence to the  required  standard,  the
    respondent can seek to  counter  it  in  the  manner  outlined  by  the
    Strasbourg court in Paposhvili, at [187] - [191]. I observe {187]:

         187.  Where such evidence is adduced, it is for the authorities  of
             the returning State, in the context of domestic procedures,  to
             dispel any doubts raised by it (see Saadi, cited above, �  129,
             and F.G. v. Sweden, cited above, � 120). The risk alleged  must
             be subjected to close scrutiny (see Saadi, cited above, �  128;
             Sufi and Elmi v. the United Kingdom, nos. 8319/07 and 11449/07,
             � 214, 28 June 2011; Hirsi Jamaa and  Others,  cited  above,  �
             116; and Tarakhel, cited above, � 104) in the course  of  which
             the authorities  in  the  returning  State  must  consider  the
             foreseeable  consequences  of  removal   for   the   individual
             concerned in the receiving State, in the light of  the  general
             situation there and  the  individual's  personal  circumstances
             (see Vilvarajah and Others, cited above, � 108; El-Masri, cited
             above, � 213; and Tarakhel, cited above, � 105). The assessment
             of the risk as  defined  above  (see  paragraphs  183-84)  must
             therefore take  into  consideration  general  sources  such  as
             reports of the World Health Organisation or of  reputable  non-
             governmental  organisations  and   the   medical   certificates
             concerning the person in question.

22. The premise for such approach being that while it is for the  appellant
    to adduce evidence about their medical  condition  and  treatment,  the
    State is better able to collect evidence  about  the  availability  and
    accessibility of suitable treatment in the receiving state.

23. Lord Wilson, with whom Lady Hale,  Lady  Black,  Lady  Arden  and  Lord
    Kitchin agreed, held in AM (Zimbabwe), at [33]:

         '33. In the event that  the  applicant  presents  evidence  to  the
            standard addressed  above,  the  returning  state  can  seek  to
            challenge or counter it in the manner helpfully outlined in  the
            judgment in  the  Paposhvili  case  at  paras  187  to  191  and
            summarised at para 23(b) to (e) above. The  premise  behind  the
            guidance, surely reasonable,  is  that,  while  it  is  for  the
            applicant to adduce evidence about his or her medical condition,
            current treatment (including the likely suitability of any other
            treatment) and the effect on him or her of inability  to  access
            it, the returning state is better able to collect evidence about
            the availability and accessibility of suitable treatment in  the
            receiving state. What will most surprise the  first-time  reader
            of the Grand Chamber's judgment is the reference in para 187  to
            the suggested obligation on the returning state to dispel  "any"
            doubts raised by the applicant's evidence. But, when the  reader
            reaches para 191 and notes the reference, in precisely the  same
            context, to "serious doubts", he will realise that "any"  doubts
            in para 187 means any serious doubts. For proof, or in this case
            disproof, beyond all doubt is a concept rightly unknown  to  the
            Convention.'

24. In this matter I have considered all the  documentary  evidence  placed
    before me including that filed by means of a 'rule 15(2A)'  application
    which is addressed below.

25. The appellant has several adverse health conditions. In respect of  her
    HIV+ infection the medical evidence relied on  confirms  that  her  HIV
    viral load has been consistently suppressed for several  years  and  by
    2019 at the latest she  has  been  considered  to  have  normal  immune
    function. She continues to receive  antiretroviral  treatment  for  her
    condition.

26. Recent medical evidence provided to this  Tribunal  confirms  that  the
    appellant   is   not   presently   subject   to   lymphadenopathy    or
    hepatosplenomegaly. As to her previous lymphoma, she is quite stable.

27. Mr. Moyo, a coordinator at a local project, confirmed by  letter  dated
    25 January 2021 that the appellant has been supported  by  the  project
    since  May  2014.  It  is  said  that  the  appellant  has  shown  some
    improvement over the years but has  other  challenges  such  as  mental
    health concerns due to  stress  and  anxiety.  The  appellant  exhibits
    mobility problems.

28. Before me Mr. Chowdhury primarily relied upon two documents in  seeking
    to establish the appellant's prima facie  article  3  case.  The  first
    being an undated expert report authored by Dr Alan Msosa,  who  at  the
    time of writing the report was a postdoctoral research associate at the
    University of York.

29. The Supreme Court observed in Kennedy v. Cordia (Services)  LLP  [2016]
    UKSC 6, [2016] 1 W.L.R. 597, at [41], that an expert in the social  and
    political conditions existing in a foreign country who  gives  evidence
    to  an  immigration  judge  is  giving  expert  evidence  of  fact.  In
    considering whether the witness is an 'expert', the Supreme  Court,  at
    [43], approved the approach adopted in the South Australian case of  R.
    v. Bonython (1984) 38 SASR 45, per King CJ at pp 46-47:

         'Before admitting the opinion of a witness into evidence as  expert
         testimony, the judge must consider and decide  two  questions.  The
         first is whether the subject matter of the opinion falls within the
         class of subjects upon which expert testimony is permissible.  This
         first question may be divided  into  two  parts:  (a)  whether  the
         subject matter of  the  opinion  is  such  that  a  person  without
         instruction or  experience  in  the  area  of  knowledge  or  human
         experience would be able to form a sound  judgment  on  the  matter
         without the assistance of witnesses possessing special knowledge or
         experience in the area, and (b) whether the subject matter  of  the
         opinion forms part of a body of knowledge or  experience  which  is
         sufficiently organized or recognized to be accepted as  a  reliable
         body of knowledge or experience, a special acquaintance with  which
         by the witness would render his opinion of assistance to the court.
         The second question is whether the witness has acquired by study or
         experience sufficient  knowledge  of  the  subject  to  render  his
         opinion of value in resolving the issues before the court.'

30. I am satisfied as  to  the  first  question  that  the  Tribunal  would
    properly be aided by expert evidence as to  health  care  provision  in
    Malawi.

31. Consideration is therefore to be given as to whether Mr. Msosa has  the
    necessary knowledge and experience so as to aid  the  Tribunal  on  the
    issue of health care provision in Malawi, in particular with regard  to
    HIV treatment. The Supreme Court held, at [50], that an expert  witness
    must demonstrate to the Tribunal that they have relevant knowledge  and
    experience  to  give  either  factual  evidence,  which  is  not  based
    exclusively on personal observation or sensation, or opinion  evidence.
    Where the expert witness establishes  such  knowledge  and  experience,
    they can draw on the general body of knowledge and understanding of the
    relevant expertise.

32. The parties discussed Mr. Msosa's report before me. Upon considering Dr
    Msosa's curriculum vitae, I am satisfied that he is  an  expert  as  to
    governance, gender, sexual rights and Malawi's justice  system.  Having
    read his report it is clear to me that it is primarily directed towards
    the  appellant's  claim  for  international   protection   based   upon
    allegations of domestic violence.  I  draw  such  conclusion  from  the
    introduction to the report which details, inter alia:

         'The facts provided related to this asylum  claim  state  that  the
         appellant fled to the  UK  because  she  was  always  subjected  to
         torture and oppression from her husband in her marriage entered  in
         1995. It also stated that she was diagnosed with HIV in 2006, which
         led to her husband and parents irrationally  blaming  her  for  the
         disease and withdrawal of support. It further states  that  she  is
         under medical consideration in the UK  and  that  her  husband  has
         threatened to  kill  her.  As  a  result,  the  claim  states,  her
         deportation [sic] will have grave consequences.  The  aim  of  this
         report therefore is to provide the  court  with  the  situation  of
         women in Malawi in terms of gender-based violence,  HIV  and  AIDS,
         economic warfare in order to explore whether  available  protection
         mechanisms are sufficient to protect her situation as presented  in
         the facts cited above.'

33. Mr. Chowdhury sought to rely upon the report as  establishing  a  prima
    facie case of potential  infringement  of  the  appellant's  article  3
    rights in respect  of  health  care.  I  note  that  there  is  limited
    discussion of this issue in Dr Msosa's report:

         'Young women (and similarly  older  women)  are  disproportionately
         affected by HIV and AIDS not only because of the lack of access  to
         support services, but also by poverty,  harmful  gender  norms  and
         socio-economic inequalities. 72% of  women  have  access  to  anti-
         retroviral treatment, which is below the UNAIDS target of 90%.'


         'Although approximately two-thirds of the women living with HIV are
         able to access treatment, intersecting  poverty  and  violence  may
         impede the most vulnerable  women  from  accessing  treatment,  for
         example, a victim of sexual or physical violence may fail to go  to
         access treatment.'


         'Deportation may mean that she loses her source of income in the UK
         ... It may  also  mean  that  she  interrupts  her  anti-retroviral
         treatment as access to treatment is not guaranteed 1000% in Malawi.
         Interruption of the treatment has serious  consequences,  including
         treatment failure.'


34. During his submissions,  Mr.  Chowdhury  candidly  accepted  that  upon
    considering Dr Msosa's curriculum vitae he is not for the  purposes  of
    these proceedings an expert in  the  healthcare  system  of  Malawi.  I
    observe that Dr Msosa references only two  documents  when  making  his
    observations  detailed  above:  UNAIDS  'Miles  to  go:  Closing  gaps,
    breaking barriers, righting injustices' (2018) and Nyalapa, M and Conn,
    C 'HIV/AIDs among young women in Malawi: A review of risk  factors  and
    interventions' (2019). I note that no reference is provided by Dr Msosa
    for his assertion that 72% of  women  have  access  to  anti-retroviral
    treatment, nor as to his assertion that two-thirds of women living with
    HIV are able to access treatment.

35. I note at this juncture that the respondent's 'Avert'  document  (2019)
    refers to UNAIDS 'AIDSinfo', detailing:

         'In 2018, 90% of people living with HIV in  Malawi  were  aware  of
         their status, of whom 87% were on treatment. Of these  people,  89%
         were virally suppressed, meaning  the  country  is  very  close  to
         reaching the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets. This equates to  78%  of  all
         people living with HIV in Malawi on antiretroviral treatment  (ART)
         and 69% of all people living with HIV virally suppressed.'

36. In circumstances where time was given by the Tribunal to the  appellant
    to collate objective country information as to the provision of  health
    care to persons suffering with HIV/AIDS in  Malawi,  it  is  surprising
    that significant reliance was placed upon Dr Msosa's report in  seeking
    to meet the demanding threshold of establishing a prima facie case. The
    report is primarily focused upon a separate aspect of  the  appellant's
    appeal which is no longer pursued.

37. Being mindful of Mr. Chowdhury's acceptance as to Dr Msosa  not  having
    expertise as to the health care  system  in  Malawi,  I  place  limited
    weight upon his general opinion on the issue.

38. The second document relied upon is  a  letter  from  Dr  Dzanjalimodzi,
    dated 5 May 2019, which is primarily concerned with the availability of
    identified  medication   concerned   with   long-term   anticoagulation
    treatment  for  saddle  pulmonary  embolism,   namely   Endoxaban.   Dr
    Dzanjalimodzi is a general practitioner in Malawi and asserts that  the
    appellant is his patient. His letter runs to three paragraphs, in which
    it is stated that Endoxaban is not readily available in Malawi  because
    of the high cost associated with its importation. Further, it is stated
    that there are an insufficient number of doctors in  the  country,  and
    this would lead to the appellant being  at  high  risk  in  respect  of
    healthcare  services.  No  further  detail  is  provided   for   either
    assertion.

39. I take judicial note that  Endoxaban  is  an  anticoagulant,  or  blood
    thinner, that is used in several treatments  including  strokes,  heart
    attacks, deep vein thrombosis as well treating  a  blood  clot  in  the
    lungs, a pulmonary embolism. Judicial note is  also  taken  as  to  the
    general use of other well-known anticoagulants  such  as  Warfarin  and
    Enoxaparin. The appellant provides no evidence as to an inability to be
    prescribed related forms of  medication  in  place  of  Endoxaban  upon
    return to Malawi.

40. Mr. Chowdhury accepted on his own initiative before me that the  First-
    tier Tribunal raised cogent concerns as to Dr  Dzanjalimodzi's  letter,
    at [42] of its decision.

         '42. ... I have noted the contents of the  letter  from  Dr  Edward
            Placid Dzanjalmodzi. Given that he is a doctor who practices  in
            Malawi (in which the appellant  has  not  resided  for  some  14
            years) I find it strange that he should refer  to  her  as,  'my
            patient'. I have thus attached less weight than otherwise to his
            claimed awareness of the drug she is  receiving  in  the  UK  to
            reduce the risk of recurrence  of  the  pulmonary  embolism  she
            suffered in  October  2018,  namely  'Endoxaban'.  Indeed,  this
            appears to  be  contradicted  by  the  letter  from  Mary  Oresi
            (Clinical Nurse Specialist at the [hospital]) wherein she states
            that the appellant was treated with 'subcutaneous injections  of
            Tinzazaparin ...'

41. The finding as to Dr Dzanjalimodzi's letter was not preserved, though I
    note that Mr.  Chowdhury  did  not  seek  to  explain  how  appropriate
    reference could be made to the appellant being a patient of the doctor.

42. I observe the recently filed letter  from  a  Specialist  Registrar  in
    Haematology, dated 29 January 2020, which confirms that  the  appellant
    was  prescribed  Edoxaban  as  at  September  2019.  There  is   little
    information provided as to the appellant's prescription at the  present
    time, but I am content for the purpose of this decision to accept  that
    the appellant continues to be prescribed Endoxaban.

43. I note that Dr Dzanjalimodzi provides no detail within his short letter
    as to what anticoagulants are used for the  treatment  of  a  pulmonary
    embolism in Malawi, and their availability. I find that no  weight  can
    be placed upon his evidence as to the  accessibility  or  otherwise  of
    suitable treatment in Malawi.

44. I observe the evidence of clinical nurse specialists provided by  their
    letter of 6 November 2020 as to concerns that the  appellant  would  be
    unable to access timely  and  appropriate  monitoring  of  her  chronic
    health conditions in Malawi. They also express concern  as  to  whether
    she could secure access to her current  medication.  I  find  that  the
    authors of the letter are not specialists in the Malawian health system
    and provide no clear  corroborated  reasoning  as  to  their  concerns.
    Rather, such concerns can properly  be  considered  to  be  genuine  in
    nature but speculative in basis. On the question as to the availability
    of appropriate treatment for the appellant in Malawi, no weight can  be
    given to the evidence of the clinical nurse specialists.

45. In addition to relying upon the evidence detailed above, the  appellant
    relied upon her witness statement dated 29 January  2021.  She  details
    psychological problems she experiences consequent to  her  HIV+  status
    and explains that following 'personal research' she is aware  that  HIV
    treatment and medication is available to a 'limited extent' in  Malawi.
    Further, she details at �10 that  she  has  no  family  or  friends  in
    Malawi: '... all of my friends are either dead or moved out  of  Malawi
    for greener pastures.'

46. When remaking a decision, the Upper Tribunal may hear such evidence and
    argument as it considers necessary, but it is not bound to  do  so  and
    can, indeed often does, decide the disputed questions  of  law  on  the
    basis of the findings of fact made by the First-tier  Tribunal:  Sarkar
    v. Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2014]  EWCA  Civ  195,
    [2014] Imm. A.R. 911. In this matter, the preserved  findings  of  fact
    included a finding  that  the  appellant  retains  significant  social,
    family  and  cultural  connections  to  Malawi.  No  objection  to  the
    preservation of such finding was made by counsel for the  appellant  at
    the hearing in October 2020.

47. During his submissions Mr. Chowdhury was unable to provide  a  rational
    explanation as to why the Tribunal should reopen the preserved findings
    in this matter. At one point he sought to withdraw the evidence, though
    ultimately accepted that such step was not  possible  in  circumstances
    where the appellant had adopted her witness  statement  and  been  both
    examined and cross-examined.

48. Ultimately, I find  the  appellant's  recent  evidence  unhelpful.  She
    candidly accepted before me that her son continues to reside in Malawi,
    contrary to an assertion made in her witness  statement.  Further,  her
    assertion that her friend Irene left Malawi soon after  the  First-tier
    Tribunal  hearing  was  very  vague  in  detail,  and  I  find  to  the
    appropriate standard to be incredible. It is simply an  unsophisticated
    attempt to undermine the preserved finding that she retains significant
    social connections to Malawi.

49. Therefore, the evidence before me as to  the  appellant's  prima  facie
    case amounts to the brief observations of Mr. Msosa, upon which limited
    weight can be placed, and the appellant's vague  observation  that  HIV
    treatment and medication is available  in  Malawi  only  to  a  limited
    extent, which is inconsistent with the information provided by means of
    the respondent's Avert document which relies upon figures  provided  by
    UNAIDS in respect of the situation in Malawi. I observe that The  Joint
    United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS (UNAIDS) is  a  joint  venture
    established by the United Nations to bring  together  the  efforts  and
    resources of  11  UN  system  organizations  in  respect  of  achieving
    universal access to HIV prevention, treatment, care  and  support.  Its
    statistics can therefore be properly relied upon by this Tribunal.

50. Consequently, whilst the appellant has adduced credible evidence as  to
    her condition and  sufficient,  though  limited,  evidence  as  to  her
    current treatment, she has provided no cogent evidence as to the likely
    suitability of any other treatment and the availability or otherwise of
    such treatment  in  Malawi.  Consequently,  she  has  not  crossed  the
    threshold of establishing a prima facie case demonstrating  substantial
    grounds for believing that she would be exposed to a real risk of being
    subjected to inhuman treatment upon return to Malawi.

51. During  submissions,  possibly  being  aware  that  the  appellant  had
    provided no cogent evidence as to a lack of suitable alternative  drugs
    in Malawi, Mr. Chowdhury sought to assert that  a  cumulative  approach
    should be taken to all of the appellant's medical conditions and  their
    impact upon her return to Malawi. However, as confirmed by the  Supreme
    Court in AM (Zimbabwe) the question for this Tribunal  is,  ultimately,
    whether there are substantial  grounds  for  believing  that,  although
    death is not imminent, the appellant  would  face  a  real  risk  of  a
    serious, rapid and irreversible decline  in  her  health  resulting  in
    intense suffering or to a significant reduction in life expectancy  due
    to a lack of access to appropriate treatment in the receiving  country.
    There is no cogent evidence before this Tribunal that  at  present  her
    other health conditions come close to crossing the required threshold.

52. On the evidence before this Tribunal, the appellant comes nowhere close
    to establishing that she would enjoy a lack of  access  to  appropriate
    treatment upon her return to Malawi.

53. Many people will have sympathy for the appellant, who  has  coped  with
    several  significant  illnesses  since  at  least  2006.  However,  the
    threshold for establishing a breach of protected article 3 rights is  a
    demanding one, and due attention is to be given to relevant information
    required consequent to the Supreme Court's judgment in  AM  (Zimbabwe).
    This is a matter where there has been a concentration by the  appellant
    on establishing the nature and extent of her illness and  treatment  in
    this country, with much more limited focus upon  the  availability,  or
    otherwise, of treatment available to her in Malawi.  The  Tribunal  can
    only properly consider the evidence before it and in this matter,  when
    considered in the round, such evidence as  is  relied  upon  is  wholly
    insufficient to establish a prima facie case. Even if that hurdle  were
    capable of being crossed, the evidence relied upon by the respondent as
    to the health care situation  in  Malawi  is  presently  sufficient  to
    establish the availability and accessibility of suitable treatment  for
    the appellant upon her return. I observe that Mr. Chowdhury  raised  no
    meaningful challenge to the contents of the Avert  document,  save  for
    noting Mr Msosa's observation as to a lower engagement  by  women  with
    medical treatment. Such general observation was not accompanied with  a
    reference to a study or official statistics  and  so  for  the  reasons
    detailed above, I prefer the referenced statistic provided in the Avert
    document.

54. In the circumstances, the appellant's article 3 appeal is dismissed.

Article 8

55. The appellant relies upon article 8, though  before  me  Mr.  Chowdhury
    confirmed that such  reliance  was  solely  concerned  with  access  to
    medical treatment. To all intents, article 8 in this matter is advanced
    as an alternative to the health care submission advanced under  article
    3.

56. In SL (St. Lucia) v Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2018]
    EWCA Civ 1894 the Court of Appeal confirmed that the  decision  of  the
    Grand Chamber in Paposhvili made a modest extension to the boundary  of
    protection against immigration removal under article 3 in medical cases
    and had no effect on the threshold or approach to private  life  claims
    under article 8 where an individual's health and medical treatment  was
    the only, or only material, issue. The proper approach remained that an
    absence of medical treatment in the country  of  return  would  not  in
    itself engage article 8. Such approach is not disturbed by the  Supreme
    Court's judgment in AM (Zimbabwe).

57. Having been unsuccessful on her article 3 ground, the appellant  cannot
    properly succeed on article 8 grounds in respect of absence of suitable
    medical treatment in Malawi.

58. The appellant does not rely upon private  life  rights  established  in
    this country or upon family  life  ties.  In  such  circumstances,  the
    article 8 appeal is dismissed.

Rule 15(2A)

59. I proceed to address procedural issues that arose  before  me.  At  the
    error of law hearing held before me on 26  October  2020,  the  parties
    agreed that it was appropriate to adjourn the remaking of the  decision
    in this matter. The respondent put the appellant  on  notice  that  she
    considered the objective evidence  relied  upon  by  the  appellant  as
    coming nowhere near close to meeting the burden  placed  upon  her.  In
    securing an adjournment, the appellant's counsel confirmed that further
    evidence would be sought to address  the  requirement  to  establish  a
    prima facie case as identified by the Supreme Court in AM (Zimbabwe).

60.  Prior  to  the  hearing  in  October  2020,  the   appellant's   legal
    representatives had adopted the erroneous approach of sending documents
    not previously relied upon to the Tribunal by email  simply  requesting
    that they be considered  at  the  hearing.  Such  approach  was  wholly
    inconsistent with the  requirement  of  explanation  detailed  by  rule
    15(2A) of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008  ('the
    Procedure Rules'):


         (2A) In an asylum case or an immigration case-


             (a) if a party wishes the Upper Tribunal to consider  evidence
                that was not before the  First-tier  Tribunal,  that  party
                must send or deliver a notice to the Upper Tribunal and any
                other party-


                  (i) indicating the nature of the evidence; and


                  (ii) explaining why it was not submitted to the First-tier
                     Tribunal; and


             (b) when considering whether to admit evidence  that  was  not
                before the First-tier Tribunal,  the  Upper  Tribunal  must
                have regard to whether there has been unreasonable delay in
                producing that evidence.

61. I detailed at [17] of my decision:

         17 ... Mr. Parkin sought time in which to  file  further  evidence,
            acknowledging that documents filed by his instructing solicitors
            the afternoon before the hearing  listed  before  me  failed  to
            comply with the requirements of rule 15(2A) ... '

62. I issued directions  that  the  appellant  file  and  serve  additional
    evidence to be relied upon, accompanied by an appropriate  rule  15(2A)
    application, no later than 14 days before the resumed hearing and  that
    the appellant file and serve a skeleton argument no later than  7  days
    before the resumed hearing.

63. Both directions were breached.

64. A rule 15(2A) application was made on behalf of  the  appellant  on  29
    January 2021,  accompanied  by  a  bundle  running  to  27  pages.  The
    application was made 7 days out of time. In addition, an  idiosyncratic
    approach was adopted of placing the written application at the back  of
    the bundle, not at the front.

65. The bundle comprised of certain documents which should not form part of
    a rule 15(2A) request, notably the notice of resumed hearing  and  this
    Tribunal's decision of 4 November 2020. In addition, a further  witness
    statement was filed on behalf of the appellant, that addressed  several
    issues, including certain preserved findings of fact.

66. Also included was a letter from  clinical  nurse  specialists  dated  6
    November 2020 addressing  the  appellant's  health  management,  and  a
    letter of support from Mr. Moyo, dated 25  January  2021.  Two  further
    documents which had formed part of the previously rejected rule  15(2A)
    application were again  provided,  namely  a  letter  from  a  hospital
    clinical haematology department, dated 29 January 2020 and  a  printout
    of a medical patient summary, dated 28 October 2019.

67. On this occasion, there was an effort to comply  with  the  explanation
    requirement of rule 15(2A)(a)(ii), but for the reasons explained to Mr.
    Chowdhury at the hearing such explanation was inadequate.

68. The core of the explanation provided  is  identifiable  at  �6  of  the
    application:

         '6. The appellant accepts  that  this  evidence  should  have  been
            adduced along  with  the  bundles  submitted  earlier,  and  she
            apologies unreservedly for the delay. It is regretted  that  the
            importance of this evidence was not properly  realised  earlier.
            Also, the appellant as a financially disadvantaged and depressed
            person of poor health condition struggled to obtain the evidence
            from different  sources,  which  contributed  to  the  delay  in
            submitting this evidence. An  additional  reason  was  that  her
            appointments with the NHS consultants were cancelled due to  the
            current pandemic  and  she  was  not  able  to  contact  various
            authorities involved in her treatment  due  to  limited  working
            patterns during the pandemic.'

69. The author of the application appears unaware of the requirement  under
    this rule that an explanation be provided as to why  the  evidence  was
    not before the First-tier Tribunal at the hearing held  on  7  November
    2019. Such lack of understanding is identifiable by reference to  delay
    caused by the present Covid-19 pandemic which post-dates the First-tier
    Tribunal hearing. I am concerned that on two occasions in  this  matter
    the  appellant's  legal  representatives  have  exhibited  a  lack   of
    understanding as to the mechanism of rule 15(2A), which on its face  is
    a simple procedural requirement that clearly sets out what steps are to
    be undertaken.

70. Further, it is unfortunate that the appellant is said to apologise  for
    clear failings in  circumstances  where  she  was  represented  by  her
    previous legal  representatives  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal.  No
    effort is made by  the  legal  representatives  to  address  their  own
    failings.

71. The appellant's legal representatives  further  informed  the  Tribunal
    that a unilateral decision had  been  made  to  serve  the  appellant's
    skeleton argument on a later date than that directed by this  Tribunal.
    No reasoning was provided as to why there was an  inability  to  comply
    with the direction. In any event the skeleton argument  was  eventually
    filed 25 minutes before the listed hearing of this appeal.  Whilst  Mr.
    Chowdhury has given cogent reasons as to why  the  second,  unilateral,
    deadline was breached, and I accept those reasons, no adequate  reasons
    were given in respect of the initial breach of directions.

72. As detailed above, the evidence submitted by means of the  rule  15(2A)
    application was accepted and  consequently  considered  because  I  was
    satisfied that the appellant should not be hindered in the presentation
    of her human rights appeal by inadequate representation.

73. Londonium  Solicitors  are  reminded  as  to  the  Tribunal's  inherent
    jurisdiction to govern proceedings before it and to hold to account the
    behaviour of lawyers  whose  conduct  of  litigation  falls  below  the
    minimum professional standards: R. (on  the  application  of  Hamid)  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2012]  EWHC  3070  (Admin).
    The Tribunal does not expect such failings in respect of directions and
    the filing of a rule 15(2A) application to arise again.

Notice of Decision

74. By means of a decision sent to the parties  on  4  November  2020  this
    Tribunal set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  promulgated
    on 27 November 2019 pursuant  to  section  12(2)(a)  of  the  Tribunal,
    Courts and Enforcement Act 2007.

75. The decision is re-made, and the appellant's  appeal  on  human  rights
    (articles 3 and 8) grounds are dismissed.

Anonymity Direction

76. Pursuant to Rule 14 of the relevant Procedure Rules I make an anonymity
    order in respect of the appellant, CS:

         'Unless the Upper Tribunal or a Court directs otherwise, no  report
         of these proceedings or  any  form  of  publication  thereof  shall
         directly or  indirectly  identify  the  appellant.  This  direction
         applies to, amongst others, the appellant and the  respondent.  Any
         failure to comply with this direction could give rise  to  contempt
         of court proceedings.'
