Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr M Symes, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Ms H Horsley, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The Secretary of State  has  been  granted  permission  to  appeal  the
    decision of First-tier Tribunal McDade allowing the appellant's  appeal
    under Article 8 of the ECHR.
2.   The appellant is a citizen of South Korea, born on 4 August 1973.   She
    arrived in the UK on 7 November 2004 in possession of  entry  clearance
    issued in 2004, valid until 3 September 2005, as a student.   According
    to her witness statement she studied English from 8 November  2004  and
    finished on 5 August 2005.  On its  completion  she  believed  she  had
    learnt sufficient English to then  embark  on  a  one  year  university
    foundation course which she did from September 2005 to June 2006.   She
    was awarded Grade A in Economics and Business Studies,  Accounting  and
    Mathematics at Stafford House College.  This  gave  her  confidence  to
    embark on a Bachelor of Business Administration degree  course  at  the
    University of Kent.  This was  to  be  a  three  year  course  from  14
    November 2006 until 31 October 2009.

3.   She completed the first year of the degree  course  but  did  not  take
    exams at the  end  of  the  first  year  because  she  had  encountered
    difficulties because her level  of  English  was  not  good  enough  to
    adequately follow the teaching.  She did  not  enrol  to  continue  the
    degree course in a second year but instead worked  at  home  trying  to
    improve her abilities in English.

4.   When she felt her English was good enough she obtained a place at  Kent
    University to study for a Bachelor of Arts in Accounting  and  Finance.
    She started the course in September 2009 and completed it on 15 October
    2012.  She was granted leave to remain for the same period to undertake
    this new course.  She successfully completed the course  and  graduated
    with an upper second class honours degree.  She paid in  total  ï¿½32,430
    for the course.

5.   The appellant then obtained a place also at Kent University for  a  one
    year MSc in Financial Marketing which she started on 15 September  2012
    which is due to end on 14 September 2013.  She  applied  for  leave  to
    remain to undertake this course and the application was refused  on  28
    January 2013.

6.   The respondent refused  the  appellant's  application  under  paragraph
    245ZX(ha) of the Immigration Rules which states:

         "If the course is at degree level or above, the grant of  leave  to
         remain the applicant is seeking must  not  lead  to  the  applicant
         having spent more than five years in the UK as a Tier  4  (General)
         Migrant, or as a student, studying courses at degree level or above
         unless:


         (i)  the applicant has successfully completed a  course  at  degree
             level in the UK of a minimum duration of four academic  years,
             and will follow a course of  study  at  masters  degree  level
             sponsored by a sponsor that is a recognised  body...  and  the
             grant of leave must not lead to  the  applicant  having  spent
             more than six years in the UK as a Tier 4 (General) Student or
             as a student studying courses at degree level or above; or


         (ii) the grant of leave to remain is to follow a course leading  to
             the award of a PhD...".


7.   The respondent stated that  although  the  appellant  had  successfully
    completed a course at degree level in the UK of a minimum  duration  of
    four years and was now applying to study a  course  at  Masters  degree
    level at a sponsor that is a recognised higher education institute, the
    total duration of study at degree level and above would  be  more  than
    six years.

8.   First-tier Tribunal Judge McDade found as follows:

         "2.  I believe it is unarguable that the Appellant does not satisfy
             the Immigration Rules.  Mr  Lewis  attempted  to  assert  that
             because she had dropped out of studying for a period  of  some
             two years the clock should stop.  This makes  no  sense.   The
             leave is given for the specific purpose of study for a  period
             of five years.  If  a  student  for  whatever  reason  is  not
             studying during that time it does not justify the  Immigration
             Rule being stretched to accommodate them.  However I  consider
             what is of significance  is  the  fact  that  this  particular
             Appellant was now at the very end of her Master's degree.  She
             has finished her exams and now  only  has  a  dissertation  to
             write up and this will be finished in September  2013.   Given
             the very considerable expenditure of time and money  over  the
             years on the Appellant's education  I  consider  it  would  be
             unduly harsh in all the circumstances not to conclude that the
             Appellant has developed a private life under  Article  8  that
             deserves respect.  I do not consider that CDS Brazil in itself
             supports the Appellant's situation as that related to an issue
             of  funding  when  all  other  immigration  requirements  were
             satisfied.  However I do consider that given what can only  be
             described as the Appellant's account of her shame  for  having
             to drop out of  a  course  some  years  ago  because  she  was
             struggling to fully  understand  its  content  because  of  an
             English language  problem  (a  matter  that  she  subsequently
             successfully addressed) that this shame related  not  only  to
             herself but to her parents' potential reaction, I consider any
             removal at this stage would seriously  adversely  impact  upon
             her emotional wellbeing.  I say  this  because  the  Appellant
             gave evidence as to the severe stress that she suffered  as  a
             result of her dropping out some years earlier.  The  Appellant
             speaks of being able to pursue a PhD in  the  United  Kingdom.
             This might well be unachievable in  view  of  the  Immigration
             Rules' five year requirement but in all  the  circumstances  I
             hold that the Appellant has established a  sufficient  private
             life  for  the  reasons  I  have   outlined   to   render   it
             disproportionate at this  stage  in  her  academic  career  to
             remove her from the United Kingdom.  This in my judgment would
             have no positive impact on the Secretary of State's legitimate
             duty to ensure immigration control."

9.   The respondent lodged an application  for  permission  to  remain  that
    contained four grounds.  In my opinion paragraphs 1 and 2 make the same
    point which is that the appellant failed to meet  the  requirements  of
    the Immigration Rules as a Tier 4 migrant under paragraph 245ZX(ha)  as
    she has exceeded the five year limit  stated  within  the  Rules.   The
    Immigration Judge failed to make any findings under the amended  Rules.
    He failed to have regard to the Immigration Rules in making its Article
    8 assessment.  The Immigration  Rules  are  a  detailed  expression  of
    government policy on controlling immigration and protecting the public.
     Therefore when a Tribunal considers an  individual  appeal  it  should
    consider proportionality in the light of the clear expression of public
    policy.  The failure to do this means that the  decision  the  Tribunal
    made on Article 8 is incomplete and is also unsustainable as it  failed
    to consider a key element in the assessment of this case.

10.  Ground 3 said further and in the alternative the judge failed  to  give
    any or adequate reasons for finding  that  the  appellant's  Article  8
    rights would be breached, in allowing the appeal on Article  8  grounds
    leading to a grant of three years' leave when the  appellant's  current
    studies  are  to  be  completed  in  September  2003  without  adequate
    reasoning amounts to a material error of law.

11.  The fourth ground said that  the  judge  materially  erred  in  law  by
    failing to limit the leave to be granted to the  appellant  as  she  is
    nearly at the end of her course and does not meet the  requirements  of
    the Rules at the date of the hearing.  The decision  by  the  Court  of
    Appeal, Miah & Others [2012] EWCA Civ 261 confirmed that  there  is  no
    near miss principle applicable to the Immigration Rules.

12.  The First-tier Tribunal Judge who granted permission said  that  taking
    into consideration the guidance of the Upper Tribunal  set  out  in  MF
    (Article 8 - new Rules) Nigeria [2012] UKUT 393 (IAC).  It is  arguable
    that the judge should have considered the application of the new  Rules
    and then gone on to consider Article  8  outside  the  Rules  informing
    himself of the greater specificity which they give  to  the  importance
    the Secretary of State attaches to the public interest.

13.  The First-tier judge then said that it was arguably  perverse  for  the
    judge to find in  favour  of  the  appellant  on  the  basis  that  the
    respondent's decision impacted upon her "emotional  wellbeing"  but  to
    reject the guidance set out in CDS (PBS "available" Article  8)  Brazil
    [2010] UKUT 305 (IAC) when the appellant appears to have been a  person
    who was admitted to follow a course that had not yet ended.  The latter
    guidance might have been  to  the  benefit  of  the  appellant  in  the
    circumstances of the case.

14.  Ms Horsley relied on the Secretary of State's grounds.   She  submitted
    that even if the judge had set out  a  grant  of  leave  to  cover  the
    duration of the appellant's current studies, he  failed  to  take  into
    account the public interest in relation to Article  8  which  outweighs
    the appellant's appeal being allowed under Article 8.   She  said  that
    the judge failed to have regard to the new Immigration Rules.   Due  to
    the change in the Immigration Rules in respect of Tier 4, the Secretary
    of State would not have been able  to  grant  the  appellant  leave  to
    undertake the Masters degree because that would  have  meant  that  she
    would be here for five years as a student under Tier 4.

15.  Ms Horsley submitted that (CDS) Brazil is still relevant.  Therein  the
    Tribunal held that Article 8 does not give a judge  liberty  to  depart
    from the Immigration Rules simply because it seems unduly  harsh.   CDS
    was decided at a time when the maintenance requirement applicable to an
    applicant was not within the Rules.  That had an influence on the panel
    to allow the applicant's appeal under Article  8.   That  decision  has
    since been incorporated directly within the Immigration Rule.  CDS says
    Article 8 may apply but there must  be  cumulative  factors  to  engage
    Article 8.  It was also decided at a time when public interest was  not
    as clearly defined as they are now within the  Immigration  Rules.   Ms
    Horsley argued that the new Rules  lay  out  the  test  for  Article  8
    private life.  The appellant has failed to meet the  Immigration  Rules
    under the point-based system.  Article 8 does not apply to her  because
    her case is not exceptional.

16.  Mr Symes submitted that there is  no  material  error  of  law  in  the
    judge's decision.  He accepted that the  judge  made  no  reference  to
    Article 8 in the Immigration Rules but that  would  not  have  made  an
    ultimate difference to the  judge's  decision.   It  is  clear  on  the
    authorities that where  the  Immigration  Rules  do  not  reflect  pre-
    existing case law, it is up  to  the  judge  to  fill  in  the  gaps  -
    paragraph 41 of MF.

17.  Mr Symes submitted that student cases are not cases where private  life
    finds a reflection in the new Immigration Rules.   Paragraph  27ADE  is
    about lengthy connection and family ties abroad.  There is a vacuum  in
    the Rules vis-ï¿½-vis Article 8 in student cases.  In  the  circumstances
    the judge's determination is defensible.   The  judge  found  that  the
    appellant had built up a private life, which was a  mix  of  education,
    financial commitment and embarrassment following  her  withdrawal  from
    the first degree course and the potential failure of not completing the
    course.  All these factors impacted on her  emotional  wellbeing.   She
    was towards the end of her studies.  Therefore removal of the appellant
    at this stage would be disproportionate.  Overall the determination was
    adequate.

18.  Mr Symes went on to consider to what extent the appellant was  culpable
    in her understanding of the Immigration Rules.  245ZX(ha) states if the
    course is at degree level or above, the grant of leave  to  remain  the
    applicant is seeking must not lead to the applicant having  spent  more
    than five years in the UK as  a  Tier  4  (General)  Migrant  or  as  a
    student, studying courses at degree level or above.  Mr Symes submitted
    that the appellant's true situation was that she spent nine months when
    she first came here on studying English and one year on a first  degree
    before pulling out.  She was granted fresh leave for a  change  of  her
    degree course which she completed.  The five years refers to the period
    of study and not a grant of five years' leave to remain.   That  should
    not count against her in the Article 8 assessment.  The approach  taken
    by the judge is satisfied.

19.  As regards CDS Mr Symes said the relevant point is  made  at  paragraph
    18 where the Tribunal states:

         "The appellant has been admitted to  the  UK  for  the  purpose  of
         higher education and has made progress enabling extension  of  stay
         in that capacity since her admission in 2007.  We acknowledge  that
         that  gives  no  rights  or  expectation  of  extension   of   stay
         irrespective of the provisions of the Immigration Rules at the time
         of the relevant decision on extension."


     Mr Symes submitted that the appellant has spent  significant  funds  on
    her studies in the UK.  The public interest in refusing the appellant's
    application is limited.

Findings

20.  I accept, as did Mr. Symes, that the judge failed  to  have  regard  to
    the new Rules under Article 8.  The Upper Tribunal in Izuazu said  that
    in cases to which the new Immigration Rules introduced  as  of  9  July
    2012 by HC 194  apply,  judges  should  proceed  by  first  considering
    whether a claimant is able to benefit under the  applicable  provisions
    of the Immigration Rules designed to address Article 8  claims.   Where
    the claimant does not meet the requirement of the  Rules  it  would  be
    necessary to go on to make an assessment  of  Article  8  applying  the
    criteria established by law.  The Upper Tribunal's  observation  in  MF
    (Article 8 - new Rules) Nigeria [2012] 00393 (IAC) to the  same  effect
    is endorsed.  In light of the decision in Izuazu I find that the  judge
    erred in law in failing to first consider whether the appellant is able
    to benefit under the new Rules in respect of Article 8.

21.  The  question  is  whether  the  error  materially  flaws  the  judge's
    decision.  Ms Horsley says it does because the judge failed to consider
    the public interest involved  in  an  assessment  of  this  nature  and
    furthermore the appellant's case was not exceptional.  Mr Symes said it
    would have made no difference  to  the  judge's  decision  because  the
    public interest to be considered under  paragraph  276ADE  talks  about
    lengthy connections the appellant has to the UK and family ties abroad.



22.  I do not find that the appellant's  understanding  of  the  Immigration
    Rules should be a consideration.  Paragraph 245ZX(ha) was in force when
    she made her application.  Under the Tier 4  Guidance  (v11.OEXT  valid
    from 6 April 2013), interruptions to study are not taken into  account.
    This is because the  Immigration  Rules  paragraphs  245ZX(h)-(hb)  are
    based on the 'grant of leave'.  This  means  that  the  two  years  the
    appellant worked at home trying to improve  her  abilities  in  English
    would not have been taken into account in calculating five years in the
    UK as a Tier  4  (General)  Migrant.   The  judge's  finding  that  the
    appellant did not qualify for leave to  remain  under  the  Immigration
    Rules was in her particular circumstances sustainable.

23.  I agree with Mr Symes that the  Article  8  Immigration  Rules  do  not
    cover the case of a student such,  as  this  appellant,  who  does  not
    qualify to remain under the Immigration Rules because the  grant  of  a
    further year would mean she would exceed five years studying in the  UK
    on a course at degree level and above.   The  Article  8  private  life
    referred to in the new Rules (paragraph 276ADE) deals with cases  where
    an applicant has a lengthy period of leave in the UK and has no social,
    cultural or family ties with the country to which they would have to go
    if required to leave the UK.  That is not the case here.  The appellant
    was applying for a further year to study for a Masters  degree  in  the
    UK.  The judge accepted that the appellant does not qualify  for  leave
    to remain under the Immigration Rules.  I also accept that there is  no
    near miss principle in the Immigration Rules.  The judge found that CDS
    did not apply to this case.  I agree with him for the reasons given  by
    him and for the reasons alluded to by Miss Horsley.

24.  There is therefore a vacuum in the Immigration Rules vis-ï¿½-vis  Article
    8  and  students.   In  the  circumstances  the  judge  was  left  with
    considering the appellant's appeal under Article 8 of  the  ECHR.   The
    judge's failure therefore to consider the Article  8  sections  of  the
    Immigration Rules discloses no material error of law.

25.  Counsel handed me a letter from Wilson Solicitors dated  30  July  2013
    addressed to the Tribunal Service.  The letter relied on paragraph  5.2
    of the Immigration Directorate Instructions concerning what  period  of
    leave  should  be  granted  when  an  appeal  against  refusal  of   an
    application under the points-based system has been allowed on Article 8
    grounds.  It states as follows:

         "Where an appeal against refusal of an application under the points-
         based system has been allowed on Article 8 grounds which relate  to
         the initial application, e.g. a refusal of a student application is
         held to be a breach of Article  8  because  the  student  would  be
         unable to complete their course, the appellant  should  be  granted
         leave of the same type and duration and on the same  conditions  as
         if the relevant points-based system application had been  granted."




26.  Wilson & Co made the point that the appellant would not therefore  have
    been granted three years' leave to remain as stated in paragraphs 3 and
    4 of the Secretary of State's grounds of appeal.   I  agree  with  this
    entirely.

27.  Wilson & Co also made the point  that  the  extract  from  the  Tier  4
    guidance shows that the appellant would only have been granted leave to
    remain until the end of her MSc course and an  additional  four  months
    after the course ends, that is, until 31 January 2014.  I do not agree.
     As the appellant's appeal could not succeed under the Tier 4 Rules and
    I find that this guidance does not apply to her.

28.  I find that had the judge relied solely on the  impact  of  removal  on
    the appellant's emotional  wellbeing,  his  decision  would  have  been
    perverse.  He did however place significant weight on the fact that the
    appellant was now at the very end of  her  Master's  Degree.   She  had
    finished her exams and now only had a dissertation  to  write  up.   In
    those circumstances, and in light of the IDI,  the  judge  should  have
    directed that the appellant be  granted  limited  leave  to  remain  to
    complete her Master's Degree.  His failure to do so  was  an  error  of
    law.

29.  I set  aside  the  judge's  decision  and  remake  it.    I  allow  the
    appellant's appeal under Article 8 of the  ECHR  only  to  the  limited
    extent that the appellant is granted leave to remain to enable  her  to
    complete her Master's Degree.
