                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent

For the Appellant:     Mr K Forrest, Advocate, instructed by Maguire
Solicitors (Scotland) Limited
For the Respondent:    Mr A Govan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The  respondent  refused  the  appellant's  asylum  claim  for  reasons
    explained in her decision dated 5 March 2016.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge Farrelly dismissed the appellant's appeal for
    reasons explained in his decision promulgated on 20 March 2017.

 3. The grounds of appeal to the UT say that  the  judge  failed  to  apply
    anxious scrutiny to the country information, which was material because
    (i) the appellant would be taken to a special court in  Tehran  airport
    and questioned for having left the country illegally; (ii) he would  be
    asked about his background, his reasons for leaving and his  connection
    with any organisation; (iii) he was not expected to lie, and would have
    to divulge why he did leave, namely to claim asylum in the basis of his
    activities with the KDPI;  and  (iv)  notwithstanding  that  the  judge
    disbelieved the appellant, the judge failed  to  consider  whether  the
    Iranian authorities would nevertheless perceive him to be  involved  in
    Kurdish political activities, placing him at real risk.

 4. In granting permission the UT said it was arguable that the  judge  did
    not consider the appellant's account in  the  context  of  Home  Office
    country  information  and  guidance  on  Iran,   produced   among   the
    appellant's documents; the judge said at �15 that a substantial  amount
    of the country  evidence  supplied  on  behalf  of  the  appellant  was
    ancient, that for instance the US State Department report provided  was
    dated 2007, so "woefully out of date",  ignoring  the  fact  that  some
    evidence was more up-to-date and some dealt with the effect  of  making
    an illegal exit from Iran.

 5. Mr Forrest based his submissions around the grant  of  permission.   He
    referred to MN [2014] UKSC 183 at �31 on  anxious  scrutiny.   He  said
    that it was difficult to see from the decision exactly what  the  judge
    had or had not accepted.  The  nearest  he  came  to  saying  that  the
    appellant was not believed was at �18 and 20, but those  passages  were
    ambiguous.  �21 used clearer language, but no basis had been  laid  for
    the conclusion there stated.   The  judge  had  not  been  referred  to
    specific passages in the background evidence, but items 3 and 4 of  his
    inventory went specifically to risks  arising  from  illegal  exit  and
    risks to Kurds, putting the appellant's  account  in  a  context  which
    enhanced his plausibility, and these had been ignored.

 6. I do not find that the grounds for  the  appellant  disclose  that  the
    making of the decision of the FtT involved the making of any error on a
    point of law.

 7. The judge did not find the appellant a reliable witness, to  the  lower
    standard.  Points are weighed both ways in  reaching  that  conclusion,
    but there is no ultimate  ambiguity  about  it.   Reasons  are  clearly
    stated, and none of them are suggested to be wrong.

 8. Grounds (i) - (ii) are framed  as  if  the  appellant  had  proved  his
    claims, which he did not.  Ground (iv) is  based  only  on  a  fanciful
    prospect of misperception by the Iranian authorities.

 9. The outcome, on the facts  found,  is  clearly  in  line  with  country
    guidance.

10. There has been no reference to anything  in  the  background  materials
    which shows that the judge erred.

11. Mr Forrest in submissions sought to make the best of an unpromising set
    of grounds, but they amount to no more than insistence and disagreement
    on the facts.

12. The decision of the FtT shall stand.

13. An anonymity direction was made in the FtT.  There is no apparent  need
    for one, but as the matter was not addressed in the UT,  anonymity  has
    been maintained in this decision.
