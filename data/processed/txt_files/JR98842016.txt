JUDGE hanson:  The claim that is  before  this  Tribunal  was  lodged  on  8
September 2016.  The impugned decision is a removal direction made  pursuant
to Section 10 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 dated 31  August  2016,
but any challenge to that is academic as the removal direction was  in  fact
deferred on 9 September 2016.  More significant  is  the  challenge  to  the
refusal of leave to remain application and  certification  of  the  same  as
being  clearly  unfounded  pursuant  to  Section  94  of  the   Nationality,
Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  The effect of the  certification  is  that
the applicant has a right of appeal but only one  he  is  able  to  exercise
once he has left the United Kingdom.

1.    The Tribunal is grateful to Mr Syed-Ali, Counsel  for  the  applicant,
    for focusing upon  the  points  in  relation  to  which  this  Tribunal
    actually has jurisdiction.  I refer in this respect to the  fact  there
    appeared in the grounds  as  originally  drafted  a  challenge  to  the
    validity of Section 117, but of course that is not a matter that can be
    dealt with by  the  Upper  Tribunal.   It  falls  within  the  practice
    statement with regard  to  jurisdiction  where  challenges  to  primary
    legislation remain within the confines of the High Court.

2.     In  relation  to  the  certification  of  the  decision  as   clearly
    unfounded, the test that has to be applied by the decision maker, which
    is also being considered by  this  Tribunal,  is  twofold.   The  first
    element is whether  it  has  been  shown  by  the  applicant  that  the
    respondent failed to consider the material made available in accordance
    with the criteria laid down by the Court of Appeal in ZL and VL  v  The
    Secretary of State [2013] EWCA Civ 25.

3.    The submission by Mr Syed-Ali on behalf of the applicant this  morning
    is that there has been no such proper consideration as he  claims  that
    there has been a clear failure by the Secretary of  State  to  consider
    Article 8 ECHR outside the Immigration Rules.  It is not disputed  that
    there was an analysis of the claim under the Rules. This is clearly set
    out at pages 3 and 4 in relation to family life,  and  before  that  in
    relation to private life, of the impugned decision.

4.    Dealing with the question that has been posed,  whether  the  decision
    maker failed to consider the matter under Article 8 outside  the  Rules
    it is necessary to read the decision letter in full.  This  is  because
    at paragraph 24 onwards there is the section  of  the  decision  letter
    headed "CONSIDERATION OF ANY EXCEPTIONAL FACTORS".  The findings  under
    the Immigration  Rules  have  not  been  shown  to  be  susceptible  to
    challenge by way of judicial review as there is nothing arguably  wrong
    in the conclusions that have been reached  by  the  decision  maker  in
    relation to that aspect of the claim.  So far as the  consideration  of
    exceptional factors is concerned,  at  paragraph  24  of  the  impugned
    decision there is specific reference  to  Article  8  of  the  European
    Convention of Human Rights, and the fact that what the  decision  maker
    was doing was undertaking an assessment of whether on the  facts  there
    was anything genuinely exceptional enough to warrant  the  exercise  of
    discretion outside the Rules in the applicant's favour.  The  structure
    of the decision letter leads to a finding that it clearly  demonstrates
    that all relevant issues were considered  lawfully  and  no  procedural
    error has been established, such as to make the decision  unlawful,  on
    that basis.

5.    That leads us on to the second head  of  the  challenge,  whether  the
    certification is sustainable and that depends upon  whether  the  claim
    might succeed on a view of the evidence that is  not  wholly  fanciful.
    The decision maker clearly set out the applicant's immigration  history
    and the basis of the claim.  The applicant claims to have a family life
    with his uncle who he lives with.  It  appears  on  the  basis  of  the
    information made available to this Tribunal that it is a  situation  in
    which the applicant lives with his uncle, albeit the applicant is  aged
    over 18 now although it is not clear there was any depth of evidence to
    show he had formed an independent life  of  his  own,  and  indeed  the
    decision maker seems to assess the claim on the basis  that  the  issue
    was the proportionality of the decision.  In fact,  had  the  applicant
    formed an independent life, then Article 8  would  not  be  engaged  in
    relation to family life and give him any right to remain,  arguable  or
    otherwise unless private life issues arose.

6.    The applicant's claim is that he has  family  life  and  private  life
    with the uncle with whom he lives, together with  an  aunt.   The  aunt
    lives in Sunderland and the applicant lives in  London.   Although  the
    aunt provides some financial support, it was not shown that  there  was
    family life recognised by Article 8 with the aunt.   Support  for  this
    proposition is found in the finding of the Tribunal  in  JB  (India)  v
    Others v An Entry Clearance Officer [2009] EWCA Civ  234,  to  which  I
    have given due consideration.

7.    The decision maker states that careful notice was taken of, or  proper
    account given, to the public interest as outlined in  Section  117B  of
    the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002,  introduced  by  the
    Immigration  Act  2014  to  which  Mr  Jolliffe  has  referred  in  his
    submissions.  The rejection of the earlier application as a result of a
    failure to provide the Bangladeshi passport referred to in paragraph 26
    is an arguably lawful decision by the Secretary of State.   If  it  was
    accepted, as appears to be the case, the reality is  that  family  life
    exists between the applicant and his uncle as  the  applicant  has  not
    formed an independent life of his own, then the issue at the end of the
    day is the proportionality of the decision which is where consideration
    of Section 117 arises.

8.    The decision maker is aware that  the  applicant  entered  the  United
    Kingdom as a child aged 11 with his parents and that an application  to
    regulate his status was made on 26 August, at that time  the  applicant
    was aged 17ï¿½.  It is not made out that the uncle and aunt were  unaware
    of the applicant's status and  the  fact  that  after  his  visit  visa
    expired he had no lawful right to remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  and
    would have been an overstayer, although there is the view expressed  in
    some circles that a minor should not have such adverse finding  imputed
    to them.

9.    This is not a case  where  the  decision  maker  was  unaware  of  any
    relevant facts, as clearly they are set out in the impugned decision in
    some detail, and it is not a case in relation  to  which  the  decision
    maker arguably failed to  apply  the  correct  legal  provisions.   The
    findings in relation to what is  clearly  the  proportionality  of  the
    decision are at paragraphs 24 to 37 of  the  impugned  decision.  These
    show that what the decision  maker  was  clearly  considering  was  the
    proportionality of the decision to reject the appellant's claim and  to
    certify the same in light of the facts known to the decision maker.

10.   The purpose of Article 8 outside the Rules is to  prevent  unwarranted
    interference with a protected right by a Member State.  It  is  not  to
    allow a person to chose where they wish to live, and  for  this  reason
    the assertion there is a clear failure of the  respondent  to  consider
    Article 8 rights of the applicant is not  made  out  in  light  of  the
    content of the  decision  letter  and  the  submissions  and  pleadings
    available to this Tribunal.

11.   It is suggested in the grounds that the applicant should  be  entitled
    to leave pursuant to 276ADE(1)(vi) on the basis that there will be very
    significant obstacles to his integration into the country to  which  he
    would have to go, but when one looks at the evidence provided  for  the
    application in support, there is no evidence of any attempt being  made
    to contact the family in Bangladesh, there is no  evidence  to  support
    the challenge to the decision of the decision maker that the  applicant
    had failed to establish  significant  obstacles  to  him  returning  to
    Bangladesh and continuing to live there. The Tribunal appreciates  that
    when one looks at the fact the applicant  was  brought  to  the  United
    Kingdom at the age 11, a fairly early  age,  it  may  be  difficult  or
    problematic for the applicant to re-establish himself, but that is  not
    the test; the test is that of the proportionality of the decision as  a
    whole when looking at Article 8 outside the Rules.

12.   Although the applicant is  arguably  not  responsible  for  his  being
    brought to the United Kingdom and being left here by his parents whilst
    they return to Bangladesh, a matter for which the parents may have  had
    good reason to allow the applicant to benefit from an education in  the
    United Kingdom and be brought up in the United Kingdom, the fact of the
    matter is that bar the initial period of his visit visa  the  applicant
    has had no lawful right to remain in the United Kingdom and no basis on
    which he could  claim  any  legitimate  expectation  that  he  will  be
    permitted to do so.

13.    The  applicant's  status  in  the  United  Kingdom  has  always  been
    precarious.    The   Tribunal   appreciates   that    when    assessing
    proportionality it is necessary to consider the fact that for  most  of
    the period in discussion  the  applicant  was  a  minor  and  therefore
    arguably under the control of others, but the reality of the matter  is
    that he has been an adult  for  some  time  and  his  status  since  he
    acquired adulthood remains precarious.

14.    Accordingly,  although  the  weight  to  be  given  to  such  status,
    according to the Court of Appeal in Rhuppiah [2016]  EWCA  Civ  803  as
    reinforced in Treebhawon [2017] UKUT 13 (IAC), is on a  sliding  scale,
    wherever the line is drawn in relation to this matter it is clear  that
    this is not a strong case that the  applicant  has  raised  before  the
    Secretary of State and not one that shows that the conclusion that  the
    claim is clearly unfounded is arguably perverse or irrational  or  that
    the answer to the question whether the claim might succeed on a view of
    the evidence it is not wholly fanciful on the facts as known, would  be
    in the affirmative.

15.   I appreciate that the applicant came to the United Kingdom as a  young
    man dependent upon his parents in a lot of respects and  thereafter  on
    other family members, but he is now an adult in his own right.   It  is
    my finding that on the basis of the  information  before  the  decision
    maker that it has  not  been  made  out  that  there  is  any  arguable
    perversity or irrationality in the conclusions reached in the  decision
    under challenge, and accordingly this challenge must fail.

Permission to the Court of Appeal

16.   In relation to two issues I have to deal with, one is the question  of
    onward permission to the Court of Appeal.  I  refuse  that  of  my  own
    motion and I stress of my own motion on the  basis  that  there  is  no
    arguable basis for granting permission  to  challenge  this  matter  in
    light of the findings I have made, especially the limited nature of the
    private  life  to  friends,  college,   school,   badminton,   friends,
    associates and relatives.



Costs

17.   In relation to the costs issue I make  an  order  that  the  applicant
    shall pay the respondent's reasonable  costs  to  be  assessed  if  not
    agreed.~~~0~~~~
