Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Diwnycz, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondents:   Mr Caswell of Dicksons Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS
The Appeal

 1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of  State  against  a  determination
    dated 5 February 2014 of First-tier Tribunal Judge Saffer and  Mr  G  H
    Getlevog which allowed the respondent's appeal against deportation.

 2. For the purposes of this  determination,  I  refer  to  Mr  AZ  as  the
    appellant and to the Secretary of State as the  respondent,  reflecting
    their positions as they were before the First-tier Tribunal.

 3. The appellant is a citizen of Hungary.

 4. The background to this matter is that the appellant was convicted on 19
    December 2011 of causing death by dangerous driving and sentenced to  4
    ï¿½ years imprisonment and disqualified from driving for 5 years.  To  be
    entirely clear, a married man, a father,  a  son  of  a  lady  who  had
    already lost another son, was killed as a  result  of  the  appellant's
    dangerous driving. The First-tier Tribunal quite  rightly  acknowledged
    their suffering as a result of the appellant's actions at [31]  of  its
    determination.

 5. It is also undisputed that the appellant has been in the UK  exercising
    Treaty rights since 2006 and it is common ground that  his  deportation
    fell to be considered against the "serious grounds of public policy  or
    public security" test set by in Regulation 21 (3)  of  the  Immigration
    (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 (the EEA Regulations).

 6. As it indicated at [7], the First-tier Tribunal also  had  to  consider
    the provisions of Regulations 21 (5) and (6)  of  the  EEA  Regulations
    when making their decision. These are as follows:

        Decisions taken on public policy, public security and public health
        grounds


        ...


        (5) Where a relevant decision is taken on grounds of public  policy
        or public security it shall, in  addition  to  complying  with  the
        preceding paragraphs of this regulation,  be  taken  in  accordance
        with the following principles-


           (a)  the  decision   must   comply   with   the   principle   of
           proportionality;


           (b) the decision must  be  based  exclusively  on  the  personal
           conduct of the person concerned;


           (c) the personal conduct of the person concerned must  represent
           a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one
           of the fundamental interests of society;


           (d) matters isolated from the particulars of the case  or  which
           relate to considerations of general prevention  do  not  justify
           the decision;


           (e)  a  person's  previous  criminal  convictions  do   not   in
           themselves justify the decision.


        (6) Before taking a relevant decision  on  the  grounds  of  public
        policy or public security in relation to a person who  is  resident
        in the United Kingdom the  decision  maker  must  take  account  of
        considerations such  as  the  age,  state  of  health,  family  and
        economic situation of the person, the person's length of  residence
        in the United Kingdom, the person's social and cultural integration
        into the United Kingdom and the extent of the person's  links  with
        his country of origin.

 7. The respondent's challenge was that the First-tier Tribunal  failed  to
    take into account or weigh properly that the appellant  had  not  taken
    responsibility for his crime and that he continued to dispute  that  he
    had been reckless. It was also submitted that the panel failed to  give
    adequate reasons for finding that such  a  crime  should  not  lead  to
    deportation  where  the  appellant  had  been  "reckless,  foolish  and
    irresponsible", according to the sentencing judge.

 8. It did not appear to me that the First-tier Tribunal in any way  failed
    to weigh the seriousness of the appellant's crime, his attitude to that
    crime or gave inadequate reasons for reaching their decision. The panel
    noted at [17] the key features of the crime, including the  appellant's
    conduct at driving so poorly in bad weather and the judge's  sentencing
    remarks on his "reckless, foolish and irresponsible" conduct.

 9. Contrary to what is suggested in the grounds and,  to  an  extent,  the
    grant of  permission  to  appeal,  the  appellant's  failure  to  admit
    dangerous driving, as opposed to  careless  driving,  was  balanced  by
    other comments in the sentencing remarks on "what I accept to  be  your
    remorse" and on the fact that  the  appellant  had  plead  guilty,  the
    sentencing judge accepting that he had "always accepted fault and  that
    you are sorry for what has happened."

10. The First-tier Tribunal went on to find  the  crime  to  be  a  serious
    matter and again referred to the impact on others at [25]. It took into
    account at [19] the respondent's view of the matter,  setting  out  the
    negative features to be weighed against the  appellant.  It  took  into
    account the professional assessments of the  appellant's  risk  of  re-
    offending and risk of serious harm at [18] and [21]. With respect to my
    colleague who granted permission to appeal, it did  not  appear  to  me
    that the First-tier Tribunal could be said to have placed  insufficient
    weight on the seriousness of the crime and  the  sentence  handed  down
    given their clear and accurate reference to the offence, the  sentence,
    the views of the sentencing judge and  the  respondent's  view  of  the
    matter.

11. Having taken the material factors into account, it was clearly open  to
    the panel here to conclude at [27] that on the basis of the  sentencing
    remarks, professional risk  assessments  and  the  appellant's  conduct
    since the offence that the risk of reoffending had  reduced  and  that,
    together with his family circumstances,  he  did  not  represent   this
    "genuine, present and sufficiently serious to one  of  the  fundamental
    interests of society."

12. The respondent's second ground appears to be  that  the  crime  was  so
    serious that in itself it justified  deportation.  With  respect,  that
    approach is expressly excluded by Regulation 21  (5)  (e)  of  the  EEA
    Regulations. The First-tier Tribunal did not err in failing to consider
    whether  the  crime  alone  was  sufficient  to   warrant   deportation
    therefore. Mr Diwyncz sensibly conceded this point for  the  respondent
    at the hearing.

13. In short, in my judgement, the  panel  addressed  the  material  issues
    before  them,  including  the  seriousness  of  the   crime   and   the
    ramifications thereof, did not fail to address a material  matter  that
    might have made a difference to the outcome of the appeal  and  it  was
    clearly within a range of reasonable responses for it to conclude  that
    deportation was not justified.  The  decision  addressed  the  relevant
    factors precisely and the adequacy of reasons challenge is really  only
    a disagreement with the conclusion that deportation was not justified.

14. For these reasons, it was not my view that the decision of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal disclosed an error on a point of law.

15. I endorse the comments of the First-tier Tribunal at [31] on  the  need
    to distinguish EEA  deportation  cases  from  those  of  other  foreign
    national criminals and its recognition of the devastating loss for  the
    family of the victim here.

16. Mr Diwnycz indicated at the hearing that  there  is  a  letter  on  the
    respondent's file which was produced on 14 March  2014,  so  after  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal, to the effect that the  respondent
    no longer sought to deport the  appellant.  Without  more  it  did  not
    appear to me that the jurisdiction of the Tribunal was affected  and  I
    proceeded to determine the matter as above. If the letter of  14  March
    2014 has any force, my decision reaches the  same  conclusion,  in  any
    event.

17. Decision

17. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal does not disclose an error on a
    point of law and shall stand.

Anonymity

I make an anonymity order under Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
    Tribunal)
Rules  2008,  precluding  publication  of  any  information  regarding   the
proceedings which would be likely to lead members of the public to  identify
the appellant, his wife or his child.  I do so in the best interests of  the
child in order prevent a likelihood of serious harm arising in that  regard.
