                            DECISION AND REASONS





 1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State (SoS) against a decision of
    the First-tier Tribunal (FTT), Judge Moore of the First-tier  Tribunal,
    which was promulgated on the 29th January 2015.  The hearing had  taken
    place on 8th July 2014, but the delay in promulgation was  not  because
    the  FTT  Judge  delayed  in  preparing  his  written  Decision.   That
    decision, which was dated 14th July 2014 was first promulgated on  25th
    July 2014 but said in the Notice of Decision that  the  appeal  by  the
    three respondents to the  present  appeal  (the  claimants),  had  been
    dismissed.  The written reasons made it quite clear that the judge  had
    intended to allow the appeals.  They  all  applied  for  permission  to
    appeal  on  this  basis  and  the  FTT  Judge  who   considered   those
    applications for permission to appeal  directed  an  amendment  of  the
    Decision on 14th August 2014 under the "slip rule", paragraph 60 of the
    Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.  This  is  what
    caused the Decision to be promulgated again, although we  do  not  know
    why this did not happen until January 2015.  It is important to set out
    this history because of an issue about whether  sections  117A-117D  of
    the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 which came into  force
    very soon after the 14th July 2014 applied to the Decision or not.   We
    will return to that below.

 2. The claimants are Nigerian nationals.  Anuoluwapo Banire  was  born  on
    18th September 1974 and is the wife of Akeem Olanrewaju Banire who  was
    born on 24th January 1968.  Their son, Amith Babdije Adigun Banire, was
    born on the 17th March 2005 in the United Kingdom.  He was,  therefore,
    8 years old at the date of the FTT hearing, and had lived in the United
    Kingdom all his life.  For clarity, we will  call  them  "the  mother",
    "the father" and "the son" respectively.

The decision of the SSHD

 3. On 28th October 2013 notices dated 23rd October 2013 were served on all
    three claimants informing them that an asylum and/or human rights claim
    had been refused and  that  they  were  now  liable  to  detention  and
    removal.  They claimed to be entitled to the grant of Leave  to  Remain
    (LTR) in the United Kingdom on the basis of rights protected by Article
    8 of the ECHR, claiming also to have met the requirements of  paragraph
    276ADE of the Immigration Rules (the Rules),  and  EX.1(a).   This  had
    been refused on 3rd  May  2013,  but  that  decision  was  reconsidered
    following correspondence threatening judicial review and refused  again
    in letters dated the 23rd October 2013 which accompanied  the  Notices.
    They were informed that  they  had  a  right  of  appeal  against  that
    decision under section 82(1) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum
    Act 2002.  Each claimant did appeal to the FTT in time.

 4. The decision of the 23rd October was taken on the  basis  that  it  was
    accepted that the relationship between the mother and  the  father  was
    genuine and subsisting.  They lived as a  family  unit  with  the  son.
    However, the respondent concluded that the  requirements  of  paragraph
    276ADE and Appendix FM of the Rules had not been met, and the  decision
    to refuse further LTR would not infringe their Article 8 rights if they
    were returned to Nigeria as a family unit.

The Facts as Found by the FTT

 5.  It was accepted on behalf of the mother and the father that they could
    not succeed in a claim for LTR under the Rules.   The  essence  of  the
    claim therefore related to the status of the son,  and  any  Article  8
    claim he might have, either under the immigration rules or on the basis
    of the exercise of the respondent's discretion outside  the  rules  and
    how that might impact of the position of his parents.

 6. The parents had a relationship in Nigeria before either of them came to
    the United Kingdom.  As a result of that  relationship,  they  had  two
    children, now aged 16 and 14, whom they have left to the  care  of  the
    father's mother.  The father  came  to  the  United  Kingdom  in  1999,
    leaving the mother pregnant with the second of  these  children.  Being
    present without leave, in 2000 he made an unsuccessful application  for
    a residence card on the basis of an asserted relationship with  another
    person, who was said to be an EEA national exercising Treaty rights  in
    the United Kingdom. The mother came to  the  United  Kingdom  in  2003.
    Although she has asserted in the past that she arrived in 2005 and  was
    admitted as a visitor, in fact, as has been confirmed by her solicitors
    in their letter of 3 April 2013, she made a  clandestine  and  unlawful
    entrance to the United Kingdom in  2003,  that  being  arranged  by  an
    agent.  The Judge found that they both have poor immigration histories,
    and have been living in the United Kingdom unlawfully for  some  years.
    He considered that their claims under the Rules  were  doomed  to  fail
    and, but for their son, so would their Article 8 claims.   Accordingly,
    leaving his position aside, they should be removed to Nigeria.

The Decision of the FTT

 7. The FTT Judge proceeded on the basis that the son was nearly 9 �  years
    old at the date of the hearing, which was an  arithmetical  error.   He
    was in fact nearly 8� years old then, and is a little over 9 years  old
    now.  He has never met his siblings in Nigeria and has spoken  to  them
    occasionally by telephone.  He has other members of his family in  this
    country to whom he is close and who live as part of  a  close  extended
    family.  He has spent 5 years in education here and is doing very  well
    at school.  He has glowing school reports and appears well settled  and
    is a popular member of his class.  The FTT Judge  made  these  findings
    about the effect on the son of removal to Nigeria:-

         "I am satisfied that if he had to go to live in  Nigeria  with  his
         parents his education would be disrupted,  as  would  his  progress
         academically and that in this regard it would not be  in  his  best
         interests to go to Nigeria.

         "I am further satisfied that [the son] has  fully  integrated  into
         society in the United Kingdom.  He has never lived  anywhere  else.
         He has made many school friends and is a member of a local football
         club that he  attends  regularly.   He  has  made  friends  at  the
         football club, as well as at school and regularly  talks  with  and
         stays with extended family members in the United Kingdom with  whom
         he goes on occasional holidays.  Taking into account that [the son]
         has never left the United Kingdom, as  well  as  his  age  and  his
         educational progress, and his relationships in the United  Kingdom,
         and his integration into society here, I am not satisfied  that  it
         would be in the best interest  of  [the  son]  to  go  to  live  in
         Nigeria."

 8. In considering the outcome of the son's claim,  the  Judge  first  said
    this

         "The appeal in respect of [the son] would not...be  allowed  taking
         into account that he had resided in the United Kingdom for a period
         in excess of 7 years and by reference to paragraph  276ADE  of  the
         Rules."

    It is not entirely clear what this  means,  in  view  of  the  ultimate
    reason for  the  decision.   Rule  276ADE(iv)  provides  the  following
    requirement for applicants for  leave  to  remain  on  the  grounds  of
    private life in the UK:-

         "(iv)    is under the age of 18 years and has lived continuously in
         the UK for at least 7 years .....and it would not be reasonable  to
         expect the applicant to leave the UK"

    It may be that this followed from the acceptance of a  submission  that
    the son was not an applicant because he had not, himself, submitted  an
    application.  We do not think it necessary to delve further  into  this
    question, but we note, in passing, the test which applies:  whether  it
    was reasonable to expect the son to leave the UK.

 9. The Judge then addressed two  observations  of  Baroness  Hale  in  two
    different cases.  First, in ZH (Tanzania) v.  SSHD  [2011]  UKSC  4  at
    paragraph 34, she said

         "Acknowledging that the best  interest  of  the  child  must  be  a
         primary  consideration  in  these  cases  immediately  raises   the
         question of how these are to be discovered.  An important  part  of
         this is discovering the child's own views..."

    It appears to us that this citation is of little  direct  relevance  to
    the exercise in which the Judge was engaged, as it simply  records  the
    importance of ascertaining the views of the child where  possible  when
    assessing her best  interests.   This  was  achieved  without  need  of
    authority in  the  present  case  because  the  child  was  himself  an
    appellant before the First-tier Tribunal and was represented by counsel
    who was of course well placed to ensure that the views of each  of  his
    clients were put before the Tribunal. In any event, there was a  letter
    from the son expressing his opinions.  More pertinent altogether is the
    earlier passage at paragraph 25 where Baroness Hale said this:-

         "Further, it is  clear  from  the  recent  jurisprudence  that  the
         Strasbourg Court will expect national authorities to apply  article
         3(1) of UNCRC and treat the best interests of a child as "a primary
         consideration". Of course, despite the looseness with  which  these
         terms are sometimes used, "a primary consideration" is not the same
         as "the  primary  consideration",  still  less  as  "the  paramount
         consideration".

10. The Judge also cited EM (Lebanon) [2008] UKHL 64 at paragraph 49, where
    Lady Hale said

         "In particular, a child is not to be held responsible for the moral
         failures of either of his parents."

11. The Judge then said that he paid regard to the Borders, Citizenship and
    Immigration Act 2009, section 55 which required the Secretary of  State
    to have regard to the need to safeguard  and  promote  the  welfare  of
    children in the United Kingdom.

12. Later, the Judge gave his conclusion.  He said

         "24. Paying regard to the case  of  Razgar  [2004]  UKHL  27  I  am
         satisfied that any proposed removal in respect of [the  son]  would
         be an interference with the exercise of his right  to  respect  for
         his  private  life  in  the  United  Kingdom  and  that   such   an
         interference would engage the operation of Article  8.   I  am  not
         satisfied that it would be in his best interest to live in  Nigeria
         with his parents as a family unit, since  he  is  fully  integrated
         into UK society and for reasons previously  stated  would  infringe
         his protected rights in relation to his private life.  In  all  the
         circumstances, I am not satisfied that  such  an  interference  was
         necessary on the grounds of effective immigration control and I  do
         not find the decision in relation to [the son] to be proportionate.

         "I am also satisfied that it would be in the best interest of  [the
         son] to continue living with both his parents in the United Kingdom
         as a family unit.  Clearly  that  is  the  wish  of  [the  son]  as
         expressed in his letter."

Submissions to the Upper Tribunal

13. The SoS submits

      a. That the FTT failed to have regard to the public  interest  factors
         as required by section 117A(2) of the Nationality, Immigration  and
         Asylum Act 2002.

      b. The Judge failed to refer to and to take account of the decision of
         the Court of Appeal in EV Philippines and ors v  SSHD  [2014]  EWCA
         Civ 874 paragraphs 55-60, and of the Supreme Court  in  Zoumbas  v.
         SSHD [2013] UKSC 74 paragraph 24.

14. Mr. Plowright, who appeared for the claimants, argued  that  the  Judge
    was fully aware of all relevant factors and gave a  carefully  reasoned
    decision that was properly open to him.  He attempted to assist us with
    the reason why the son's claim would  not  have  succeeded  under  Rule
    276ADE which we discuss briefly above and it was Mr. Plowright properly
    who pointed out the error as to the age of the son.  The issue  of  the
    application of section 117A-D also benefited from his  assistance,  and
    it became clear that the decision was promulgated on 25th July 2014 and
    changed only by the slip rule.  The provisions were  not  in  force  on
    that date and did not apply.

Discussion and Conclusion on the Appeal

15. We set out first paragraph 24 of Zoumbas:-

         "24 There is no irrationality in the conclusion that it was in  the
         children's best interests to go with their parents to the  Republic
         of Congo. No doubt it would have been possible to have stated that,
         other things being equal, it was  in  the  best  interests  of  the
         children that they and their parents stayed in the  United  Kingdom
         so that  they  could  obtain  such  benefits  as  health  care  and
         education which the decision-maker recognised might be of a  higher
         standard than would be available in the  Congo.  But  other  things
         were not equal. They were not British citizens. They had  no  right
         to future education and health care in this country. They were part
         of a close-knit family with highly educated parents and were of  an
         age when their emotional needs could only be fully met  within  the
         immediate family unit. Such integration as had occurred into United
         Kingdom society would have been predominantly  in  the  context  of
         that family unit. Most significantly, the decision-maker  concluded
         that they could be removed to the Republic of Congo in the care  of
         their parents without serious detriment to their well-being..."

16. There is no finding of any serious detriment to the well-being  of  the
    son should he be removed with his parents to Nigeria.

17. In paragraphs 55-60 of EV Philippines v SSHD Lewison LJ said this:-

         "55 Underlying these statements of principle is the real world fact
         that the parent has no right to remain in the UK.  So  no  counter-
         factual assumption is being made, and the interests  of  the  other
         family members are to be considered in the light of the real  world
         facts. This is not an approach which is confined to  domestic  law.
         In �ner v The Netherlands (2007) 45 EHRR 14 , as Lady Hale  pointed
         out, the  Grand  Chamber  said  that  one  of  the  factors  to  be
         considered was:

             "the  best  interests  and  well-being  of  the  children,  in
             particular the  seriousness  of  the  difficulties  which  any
             children of the applicant  are  likely  to  encounter  in  the
             country to which the applicant is to be expelled."

         56 This, too, takes as the starting point the real world fact  that
         the applicant has no right to be in the host country.  Likewise  in
         Rodrigues da Silva, Hoogkamer v Netherlands (2007) 44 EHRR  34  the
         court said that:

             "Factors to be taken into account  in  this  context  are  the
             extent to which  family  life  is  effectively  ruptured,  the
             extent of the ties in the contracting state, whether there are
             insurmountable obstacles in the way of the  family  living  in
             the country of origin of one or more of  them,  whether  there
             are factors of immigration control (eg a history  of  breaches
             of immigration law) or considerations of public order weighing
             in favour of exclusion." (Emphasis added)

         57 Finally, at [29] Lady Hale returned to the test. She said that:

             "Specifically, as Lord Bingham indicated in  EB  (Kosovo),  it
             will involve asking whether it is  reasonable  to  expect  the
             child to live in another country."

         58 In my judgment, therefore, the assessment of the best  interests
         of the children must be made on the basis that  the  facts  are  as
         they are in the real world. If one parent has no right  to  remain,
         but the other parent does, that is the background against which the
         assessment is conducted. If neither parent has the right to remain,
         then that  is  the  background  against  which  the  assessment  is
         conducted. Thus the ultimate question will be: is it reasonable  to
         expect the child to follow the parent with no right  to  remain  to
         the country of origin?

         59 On the facts of ZH it was not reasonable to expect the  children
         to follow their mother to Tanzania, not least  because  the  family
         would be separated and the children would be deprived of the  right
         to grow up in the country of which they were citizens.

         60 That is a long way from the facts of our case. In our case  none
         of the family is a British citizen. None has the right to remain in
         this  country.  If  the  mother  is  removed,  the  father  has  no
         independent right to remain. If the parents are removed, then it is
         entirely reasonable to expect the children to go with them. As  the
         immigration judge found it is obviously in their best interests  to
         remain with their parents. Although it is, of course a question  of
         fact for the tribunal, I cannot see that the desirability of  being
         educated at public expense in the UK can outweigh  the  benefit  to
         the children of remaining with their parents.  Just  as  we  cannot
         provide medical treatment for the world, so we cannot  educate  the
         world."

18. The above statements of principle are binding  on  us,  and  they  were
    binding on the FTT Judge.  It is to be recalled that the relevant issue
    under Rule 276ADE is, in the case of the son, whether it is "reasonable
    to expect the applicant to leave the UK".  This question, according  to
    these decisions, is also relevant in deciding how the best interests of
    the child are to be a primary consideration in the Article  8  decision
    without elevating them to the primary  consideration,  still  less  the
    paramount consideration.  In this respect, they anticipate  the  effect
    of section 117B(6) of the 2002 Act where, as here, the child  concerned
    is a "qualifying child" as defined in the Act.

19. The Judge in this case made a finding as to the best  interest  of  the
    child and concluded directly from that finding  that  his  removal  was
    disproportionate.  This was an error.  He ought to have ascertained the
    best interests of the child in the light of the position of the  family
    as a whole, in particular in the light of the position of his  parents,
    and then asked himself whether it was reasonable to expect the child to
    go with his parents to live in Nigeria.  If it was not, then that might
    be a factor which was capable of  displacing  the  public  interest  in
    effective immigration control which, as is not in dispute, required the
    removal of his parents.  That is not to punish the child for the  moral
    wrong doing of his parents.  It is to assess the Article 8  balance  in
    the "real world".  The reason why the parents have no right  to  remain
    in the UK is not material to this exercise.  The fact is that they have
    none.  The way in which the Judge might have  approached  the  exercise
    had he approached the case  by  asking  the  question  posed  above  is
    illustrated by our findings when we answer it in re-making the decision
    below.

20. For this reason, the Decision of the Judge must be  set  aside.   There
    being no real dispute as to any factual issue, we can move  to  re-make
    the decision ourselves.

The Decision remade

21. Sections 117A-D of the 2002 Act do now apply to  our  decision.   These
    provide, so far as relevant:-

         '117A Application of this Part

         (1) This Part applies where a court  or  tribunal  is  required  to
         determine whether a decision made under the Immigration Acts-

             (a) breaches a person's  right  to  respect  for  private  and
             family life under Article 8, and

             (b) as a result would be unlawful under section 6 of the Human
             Rights Act 1998.

         (2) In considering the  public  interest  question,  the  court  or
         tribunal must (in particular) have regard-

             (a) in all cases, to  the  considerations  listed  in  section
             117B, and

             (b) in cases concerning the deportation of foreign  criminals,
             to the considerations listed in section 117C.

         (3) In subsection (2), "the public  interest  question"  means  the
         question of whether  an  interference  with  a  person's  right  to
         respect for private and family  life  is  justified  under  Article
         8(2).

         117B Article 8: public interest considerations  applicable  in  all
         cases

         (1) The maintenance of effective immigration  controls  is  in  the
         public interest.

         (2) ...........

         (4) Little weight should be given to-

             (a) a private life, or

             (b) a relationship formed with a qualifying partner,

         that is established by a person at a time when the person is in the
         United Kingdom unlawfully.

         (5) Little weight should be given to a private life established  by
         a person  at  a  time  when  the  person's  immigration  status  is
         precarious.

         (6) In the case of a person who is not liable to  deportation,  the
         public interest does not require the person's removal where-

             (a)  the  person  has  a  genuine  and   subsisting   parental
             relationship with a qualifying child, and

             (b) it would not be reasonable to expect the  child  to  leave
             the United Kingdom.'

22. Section 117B(6) may therefore operate to assist the mother  and  father
    if it would not be reasonable to expect the son  to  leave  the  United
    Kingdom.  This question has now, therefore, assumed  an  importance  by
    statute.  Parliament has directed the attention  of  tribunals  to  it,
    following the case law referred to above, and other similar  decisions.
    It has given its weight also to the test used by the Secretary of State
    in drafting paragraph 276ADE(1)(iv) of the Rules.

23.  S117B(1) provides statutory confirmation of the fact that  maintenance
    of effective immigration control is to be regarded  as  in  the  public
    interest.  Both parents are unlawfully present in  the  United  Kingdom
    and it is not  suggested  that  they  have  themselves  any  basis  for
    remaining in the  United  Kingdom.   The  question  is  whether  it  is
    reasonable to expect the child to go with them.  The answer is that  it
    is.  He is not thereby surrendering any rights he may have as a British
    citizen to health care and  education  because  he  is  not  a  British
    citizen.  It is obviously in his best interests to  be  with  both  his
    parents who have cared for him from birth, and he has family in Nigeria
    with whom he can become acquainted.  He is still young, and we bear  in
    mind the decision of the UTT  in  Azimi-Moayed  and  Others  (Decisions
    Affecting Children; Onward Appeals); Azimi-Moayed v Secretary of  State
    for the Home Department [2013] I.N.L.R. 693

         "As a starting point it is in the best interests of children to  be
         with both their parents and if both parents are being removed  from
         the UK then so should dependent children who  form  part  of  their
         household unless  there  are  reasons  to  the  contrary.  However,
         lengthy residence in a country other than the state of  origin  can
         lead to development of social cultural and educational ties that it
         would be inappropriate to disrupt, in  the  absence  of  compelling
         reason to the contrary. What amounts to lengthy  residence  is  not
         clear cut but past and present policies have identified 7 years  as
         a relevant period. Seven years from age 4  is  likely  to  be  more
         significant to a child than the first 7 years of life."

24. Essentially, this is a private life case.  The family life in  play  is
    principally that enjoyed between the father, mother and son.  That will
    continue undisturbed after  the  family  return  together  to  Nigeria.
    Indeed, the family will be reunited in that the siblings will, for  the
    first time, all be living in the country of which  they  are  citizens.
    It has not been established that there is any aspect  of  private  life
    that cannot be replicated by the claimants in  Nigeria.   We  recognise
    that there will be some disruption to be overcome, especially  for  the
    son who will have to continue his education in Nigeria.  But  there  is
    no issue as to language and he will have the support  of  relatives  as
    well as his parents.   With the support of his parents and, it is to be
    hoped, of his wider family, there is no reason to suppose that he  will
    not integrate quickly and successfully into that society.

25. Drawing all this together we  have  concluded  that  it  would  not  be
    unreasonable to expect the son to return to Nigeria with  his  parents.
    Therefore, although the son  is  a  qualifying  child,  as  defined  by
    section 117D, because he has lived in the United  Kingdom  continuously
    for  more  than  seven  years,  he  does  not  fall  within   paragraph
    276ADE(1)(iv) of the immigration  rules  and  nor  can  he  derive  any
    benefit from the application of section 117B(6) such as to displace the
    public interest in the maintenance of effective immigration control. It
    is plain that the maintenance of effective immigration control requires
    the removal of the father and mother, little weight being given to  any
    private life established while unlawfully present.

26. For the avoidance of any possible doubt, we  have  not  restricted  our
    assessment of the claim under Article 8 of the ECHR to  an  application
    of the Immigration Rules and section 117 of the 2002 Act. We have  also
    considered whether, taken as a whole, the case advanced  on  behalf  of
    the claimants discloses any compelling reason for the  grant  of  leave
    outside the statutory framework in order to secure an outcome compliant
    with Article 8 of the ECHR but we have concluded that it does not.

27. For these reasons we substitute a fresh decision to dismiss each of the
    appeals against the decision of the respondent under challenge in these
    proceedings.

Notice of Decision

The Secretary of State's appeal to the Upper Tribunal is allowed.

The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Moore, promulgated on  29  January
2015, is set aside.

We substitute a fresh decision to dismiss each of these appeals  both  under
the immigration rules and on human rights grounds.

No anonymity direction is made.
