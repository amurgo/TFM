Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms A Fijiwala, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr A Vaughan (counsel)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    I have considered whether any parties require  the  protection  of  an
anonymity direction. No anonymity direction was made previously  in  respect
of this Appellant. Having considered all the circumstances  and  evidence  I
do not consider it necessary to make an anonymity direction.

2.    The Secretary of State for the Home Department brings this appeal  but
in order to avoid confusion the parties are referred to as they were in  the
First-tier Tribunal. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State  against  a
decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Perry, promulgated on 13 January  2015
which allowed the Appellant's appeal on article 8 ECHR grounds

Background

3.    The Appellant was born on 28/10/1993 and is a national of Brazil.  The
appellant's mother entered the UK  on  2nd  October  2003.  The  appellant's
stepfather entered the UK in October 2003. In  March  2004  the  appellant's
mother and stepfather married in the UK. The appellant entered the UK on  10
July 2004. The respondent granted  the  appellant's  mother  and  stepfather
leave to remain in the UK until 31 July 2007.

4.    On 12 December 2008 the appellant's mother  submitted  an  application
for leave to remain outside the rules on the basis of  her  article  8  ECHR
rights. The appellant and his step father  were  listed  his  dependants  on
that application. The respondent refused that  application  initially  on  3
August 2009. It was discovered that the decision was made in  error  because
the appellants' then representatives  had  submitted  an  application  which
contained matters which did not relate to these  appellants  but,  in  fact,
related to one of their other  clients.  When  the  mistake  was  discovered
further representations were made leading to a  refusal  decision  from  the
respondent dated 23rd of August 2013. In  the  face  of  a  judicial  review
challenge from the appellants, the  respondent  reconsidered  that  decision
and issued a fresh refusal decision on 24 July 2014.

The Judge's Decision

5.     The  Appellant  appealed  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   First-tier
Tribunal Judge Perry ("the Judge") The Judge allowed the appellant's  appeal
on article 8 ECHR grounds. At  the  same  time,  the  Judge  considered  the
appeals of the  appellant's  mother  and  stepfather,  and  dismissed  their
appeals (IA/31910/2014 & IA/31911/2014). The decisions in  relation  to  the
appellant's mother and stepfather are  the  subject  matter  of  a  separate
appeal to the Upper Tribunal

6.    Grounds of appeal were lodged and on 23  February  2015  Judge  Parkes
gave permission to appeal stating inter alia

    "2.    The appellant had applied with his parents for LTR under article
    8. The applications were refused. The appellant's parents' appeals were
    dismissed and they have sought permission to  appeal.  His  appeal  was
    allowed outside the rules under article 8.

    3.     The grounds argued that the judge erred in  the  proportionality
    assessment with regard to sections 117A and 117B and that  the  factors
    in section 117A(2) and 117B were not considered. It  appears  that  the
    judge did not have regard to the precarious nature  of  the  appellants
    LTR and accorded greater weight than it merited."

The Hearing

7.    (a) Ms Fijiwala for the respondent told me that the decision does  not
contain any explicit reference to section 117B of the 2002  Act,  nor  other
any findings in fact directed at the statutory provision.  She  argued  that
at [70] it is hard to see whether the Judge is  finding  in  favour  of  the
appellant on the basis of family life or on the basis of  private  life.  At
[54] the Judge finds that family life exists between the appellant  and  his
mother and stepfather,  so,  she  argued,  the  findings  at  [70]  must  be
findings in relation to private life. She argued (relying  on  AM  (Malawi))
that the appellant's presence in the UK  has  been  precarious.  Subsections
(4) & (5) of section 117B require little weight to be given to such  private
life when presence in the UK is precarious. The  Judge  failed  to  consider
the precarious nature of the appellant's presence in the UK and,  she  said,
attached to much weight to any  private  life  established  in  the  UK.  Ms
Fijiwala relied on the cases of Forman and Deelah.

8.    Mr Vaughan, for the appellant, took me through  the  entire  terms  of
section 117B of the 2002 Act, and argued that although  the  Judge  did  not
use those provisions as a specific checklist, it was abundantly  clear  from
the decision that he was mindful of the provisions of  s117B,  to  which  he
clearly refers at [44], and which he clearly kept  in  mind  in  making  his
findings of fact. Mr Vaughan told me that a careful reading of the  decision
discloses that there is nothing which had not been considered by  the  Judge
and that if the appellant  were  to  make  an  application  today  he  would
succeed in terms of the rules because he has now spent  more  than  half  of
life UK & is under the age of 25 years. He relied on the case  of  SS  Congo
and told me that the determination in relation to this  appellant  does  not
contain any errors of law material or otherwise.

Analysis

9.    In Forman (ss 117A-C considerations) [2015] UKUT 00412  (IAC)  it  was
held that the list of considerations contained in section 117B  and  section
117C of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002  (the  "2002  Act")
is not exhaustive.  A court or tribunal is entitled  to  take  into  account
additional considerations, provided that they  are  relevant  in  the  sense
that they properly bear on the public interest question; in cases where  the
provisions of sections 117B-117C of the 2002 Act arise, the decision of  the
Tribunal must demonstrate that they have been given full effect.

10.   In Deelah and others (section 117B - ambit) [2015]  UKUT  00515  (IAC)
the  Tribunal  held  that  Sections  117A  and  117B  of  the   Nationality,
Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 are not confined to an appeal under  section
84(1)(c). They apply also to appeals  brought  under  section  84(1)(a)  and
(g).

11.   In AM (S 117B) Malawi [2015] UKUT 260 (IAC)  the  Tribunal  held  that
the statutory duty to consider the matters set out in s  117B  of  the  2002
Act is satisfied if the Tribunal's decision shows that it has had regard  to
such parts of it as are relevant.

12.   The Judge wrote  a  detailed  and  careful  decision.  The  first  two
appellants appealed against that decision and, in  a  separate  decision  of
the Upper Tribunal their appeals  have  been  dismissed,  and  the  decision
allowed to stand.

13.   Although there are no material errors of law in the  decision  insofar
as it relates to the first and second appellants, the position of the  third
appellant alone is different and is drawn into focus at [70].  It  is  there
that the Judge  carries  out  a  proportionality  assessment  of  the  third
appellant's case and finds that article 8  ECHR  is  engaged  and  that  the
respondent's decision is a disproportionate interference  with  both  family
and private life. Before reaching that conclusion  an  inadequate  balancing
exercise is carried out, and no reference  (anywhere  in  the  decision)  is
made to section 117 of the 2002 Act. From a careful reading the decision  it
is not clear that the factors set out in section 117 of the  2002  Act  have
been taken into account.

14.   I therefore have to find that the  decision  is  tainted  by  material
errors  of  law  because  it  races  to  a  conclusion  without   sufficient
explanation.  As the decision contains material errors  of  law,  I  set  it
aside. There is sufficient evidence before me to enable  me  to  remake  the
decision.

Findings of Fact

15.   This appellant is a Brazilian national born on  28  of  October  1993.
The appellant's mother left Brazil & entered the UK  in  October  2003.  The
appellant entered the UK as the dependent of his mother of 10 January  2005.
He has remained in the UK since then.

16.   Throughout his time in the UK the appellant has lived with his  mother
and his step-father. It is reasonably  foreseeable  the  appellant's  mother
and stepfather will be returning to Brazil  as  their  appeals  against  the
respondent's decision to refuse to grant leave to  remain  in  the  UK  have
been unsuccessful. The appellant has two adult  siblings  who  are  probably
still in Brazil.

17.   The appellant was seven years old when he arrived in  the  UK,  he  is
now 22 years old. The appellant has lived in the UK for more  than  half  of
his life. Since March 2015 the appellant has  had  is  a  strong  chance  of
success with an application for leave to remain under paragraph  276  ADE(v)
of the rules.(he has not made a separate application)

18.   The appellant is now a student at Brunel University. He has enjoyed  a
relationship for the last seven years with the  same  girlfriend.  He  would
like to marry his girlfriend and start a family.

19.   Although the date of application in this case was  12  December  2008,
the decision against which this appeal is directed was  not  made  until  24
July 2014. The appellant has not made his own  independent  application  for
leave to remain in the UK.

The Immigration Rules

20.   It has always been the  appellant's  position  that  the  respondent's
decision in relation to the immigration rules is correct. It was  not  until
March 2015 that the appellant could have submitted his own  application  for
leave to remain and expected it  to  meet  with  success.  At  the  date  of
application and at the date of decision the appellant  could  not  meet  the
requirements of the immigration rules. In this  appeal,  it  is  not  argued
that the appellant can succeed under the  immigration  rules.  As  a  single
man, he cannot fulfil the requirements of appendix FM. Because  of  his  age
at the date of application, and the  nature  of  the  applications  made  in
relation to this decision, he cannot fulfil the  requirements  of  paragraph
276 ADE.

Article 8 ECHR

21.   In SS (Congo) and Others [2015] EWCA Civ  387  Lord  Justice  Richards
said at paragraph 33 "In our judgment, even though a test of  exceptionality
does not apply in every case falling within the scope of Appendix FM, it  is
accurate to say that the general  position  outside  the  sorts  of  special
contexts referred to above is that compelling circumstances  would  need  to
be identified to support a claim for grant of LTR outside the new  Rules  in
Appendix FM. In our view, that is a formulation which is not as strict as  a
test of exceptionality or a requirement of  "very  compelling  reasons"  (as
referred to in MF (Nigeria) in  the  context  of  the  Rules  applicable  to
foreign criminals), but  which  gives  appropriate  weight  to  the  focused
consideration  of  public  interest  factors  as  finds  expression  in  the
Secretary of State's formulation of the new Rules in Appendix  FM.  It  also
reflects the formulation in Nagre at para. [29], which has been  tested  and
has survived scrutiny in this court: see, e.g.,  Haleemudeen  at  [44],  per
Beatson LJ".

22.   In R (on the application of Esther Ebun Oludoyi & Ors) v Secretary  of
State for the Home Department (Article 8  -  MM  (Lebanon)  and  Nagre)  IJR
[2014] UKUT 00539 (IAC) it was held that there is nothing  in  R  (Nagre)  v
SSHD [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin), Gulshan (Article  8  -  new  Rules  -  correct
approach) Pakistan [2013] UKUT 640 (IAC) or Shahzad (Art 8: legitimate  aim)
[2014] UKUT 00085 (IAC) that  suggests  that  a  threshold  test  was  being
suggested as opposed to making it clear that there was a  need  to  look  at
the evidence to see if  there  was  anything  which  has  not  already  been
adequately considered in the context of  the  Immigration  Rules  and  which
could lead to a successful Article 8 claim. These authorities  must  not  be
read as seeking to qualify or fetter the assessment of Article  8.  This  is
consistent with para 128 of R (MM & Others) v  SSHD  [2014]  EWCA  Civ  985,
that there is no utility in  imposing  a  further  intermediate  test  as  a
preliminary to a consideration of an Article 8  claim  beyond  the  relevant
criterion-based Rule. As is held in R (Ganesabalan) v SSHD [2014] EWHC  2712
(Admin), there is no prior threshold which dictates whether the exercise  of
discretion should be considered; rather the nature  of  the  assessment  and
the  reasoning  which   are   called   for   are   informed   by   threshold
considerations.

23.   Section 117 of the 2002 Act is a factor to be taken  into  account  in
determining proportionality.  I  appreciate  that  as  the  public  interest
provisions are now contained in primary legislation they  override  existing
case law, Section 117A(2) requires me to have regard to  the  considerations
listed in Sections 117B and 117C.  I am conscious of my  statutory  duty  to
take these factors into account when coming to my conclusions.   I  am  also
aware that Section 117A(3) imposes upon  me  the  duty  of  carrying  out  a
balancing exercise. In so doing I remind myself of  the  guidance  contained
within Razgar.

24.   I must ask the following questions

         (i)      Does family life, private  life,  home  or  correspondence
         exist within the meaning of Article 8

         (ii)     If so, has the right to respect for this  been  interfered
         with

         (iii)    If so, was the interference in accordance with the law

         (iv)     If so, was the interference  in  pursuit  of  one  of  the
         legitimate aims set out in Article 8(2); and

         (v)      If so, is the interference proportionate to the pursuit of
         the legitimate aim?

25.   In Kugathas v SSHD [2003] INLR 170 the Court of Appeal said  that,  in
order to establish family life, it is necessary to  show  that  there  is  a
real committed or effective  support  or  relationship  between  the  family
members and the normal emotional ties between a  mother  and  an  adult  son
would not, without more, be enough. In Etti-Adegbola v SSHD [2009] EWCA  Civ
1319 the Court of Appeal concentrated on the last  part  of  that  test  and
confirmed that the Tribunal had applied the right test  in  finding  that  a
family's behaviour was "no way exceptional  or  beyond  the  norm".   In  JB
(India) and Others v ECO, Bombay [2009] EWCA Civ 234  the  Court  of  Appeal
reiterated that the approach in Kugathas must be applied to the question  of
whether family life for the purposes of Article 8 subsists  between  parents
and adult children.

26.   Family life does not exist for this appellant in the UK. Although  the
appellant has lived with his mother and stepfather  since  arriving  in  the
UK, he is now a 22-year-old adult whose seven-year  long  relationship  with
his girlfriend has led him to talk of moving from his parents  &  committing
himself in marriage to his  girlfriend.  The  appellant's  own  evidence  is
evidence of a desire to set up a new household, independent  of  his  mother
and stepfather.

27.   Family  life  does  not  yet  exist  between  the  appellant  and  his
girlfriend/fianc�e. That family life may well be created at  some  point  in
the future but at today's date it does not  exist.  The  appellant  and  his
girlfriend do not live together. They are not married. They are not  members
of the same family. If they're not members of the same family,  family  life
cannot exist in terms of article 8 ECHR.

28.   The appellant has quite clearly established private life  in  the  UK.
The appellant was only seven years and three months old when he  arrived  in
the UK. He spent less than 32% of his life in Brazil and more  than  68%  of
his life in the UK. He was educated  in  the  UK.  He  is  now  studying  at
university in the UK. He has developed a significant  romantic  relationship
throughout the last seven years,  and  now  has  hopes  for  a  career,  for
marriage and a family.

29.   The impact of the respondent's decision would be to remove all of  the
component parts of private life listed at [28] (above) from  the  appellant;
but I must consider section 117 the 2002 Act. Effective immigration  control
is in the public interest. It is  also  in  the  public  interest  that  the
appellant  can  speak  English  fluently  and  is  financially  independent.
However, throughout the appellant's time in the UK's his immigration  status
has been precarious. I must therefore give  little  weight  to  the  private
life that the appellant has established.

30.   I balance the respondent's interest in preserving fair  and  effective
immigration control to protect this country's fragile economy. In Nasim  and
others (Article 8) [2014] UKUT 25 (IAC) it was held that  the  judgments  of
the Supreme Court in Patel and Others v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
Department [2013] UKSC 72 serve to re-focus  attention  on  the  nature  and
purpose of Article 8 of the ECHR  and,  in  particular,  to  recognise  that
Article's limited utility in private life cases that are  far  removed  from
the protection of an individual's moral and physical integrity.

31.   The determinative factor in this case is that  since  March  2015  the
appellant could have withdrawn from this appeal process  and  submitted  his
own independent application for leave to remain in the  UK  under  paragraph
276 ADE. Because of the length of time the appellant has been in the UK  and
because of his age, he could realistically expect  that  application  to  be
successful. Whilst  the  appellant  derives  no  benefit  from  section  117
factors which weigh in his favour, the weight that tips the balance  in  the
appellant's favour is that, at today's date, he fulfils the requirements  of
the immigration rules.  The  weight  of  reliable  evidence  indicates  that
article 8 private life is established. The  appellant  has  certain  factors
set out in section 117 which weigh in his favour;  because  his  immigration
status is precarious those factors are neutral.

32.   The appellant is a young man whose formative years were spent  in  the
UK and his plans for the future are focused in the� UK. My decision  creates
separation between the appellant and his mother and stepfather,  but  at  22
years of age, facing marriage and the establishment of his  own  home,  that
is a separation which is an inevitable step in life and  not  a  consequence
of the respondent's decision. The appellant could  realistically  expect  to
make his own  successful  application  for  leave  to  remain  in  terms  of
paragraph 276 ADE of the immigration rules. Carefully  balancing  all  those
factors,  I  can  only  find   that   the   respondent's   decision   is   a
disproportionate breach to the appellant's  right  to  respect  for  private
life in terms of article 8 ECHR.

Conclusion

33.   I therefore find that the Judge's decision is tainted  by  a  material
error of law. I set aside the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  because
it contains a material error of law. I substitute the following decision.

Decision

I dismiss the appeal under the Immigration Rules.

I allow the Appeal on Articles 8 ECHR grounds only.
