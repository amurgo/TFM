Representation:

For the Appellants:    Mr T Royston instructed by Paragon Law
For the Respondent:    Miss C Johnstone, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The first Appellant is an Ethiopian  national  born  on  19th  November
    1987.  She is the mother of  the  second  Appellant  who  was  born  in
    Ethiopia in June 2012 and is also of Ethiopian nationality.

 2. The Appellants applied for entry clearance to  join  the  Sponsor,  the
    first Appellant's husband and second  Appellant's  father.  The  family
    relationship is not disputed.

 3. The applications were refused by the Respondent on 15th  November  2012
    because it was  considered  that  the  financial  requirements  of  the
    relevant Immigration Rules were not satisfied.  The  Sponsor  needed  a
    gross income of at least ï¿½22,400 but  his  declared  income  fell  well
    short of that figure.  The  application  was  therefore  refused  under
    paragraph EC-P.1.1(d) of Appendix FM.

 4. Notices of Appeal were lodged on behalf  of  both  Appellants  and  the
    matter  came  before  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Colyer   at
    Nottingham on 6th December 2013.  In a determination promulgated on 7th
    January 2014 the appeals were allowed under section EX of  Appendix  FM
    and under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.

 5. The Respondent's representative applied for permission to appeal to the
    Upper Tribunal on the basis  that  the  First-tier  Judge  had  made  a
    material misdirection in law.  Grounds  submitted  in  support  of  the
    application argue that section EX1 of Appendix FM is  not  a  potential
    route to qualifying for entry clearance.  This is to be contrasted with
    R-LTRP: requirements for limited leave to remain as a partner where  it
    is accepted that paragraph EX1 does apply.   The  grounds  also  relied
    upon the decision in Gulshan [2013] UKUT 00640 (IAC) where it was  held
    that the Article 8 assessment shall only be carried out where there are
    compelling circumstances not recognised by the Rules.  In this case  it
    is submitted  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  not  identify  such
    compelling circumstances and its findings are therefore unsustainable.

 6. Permission  to  appeal  was  granted  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal  by
    Designated Judge Shaerf on 28th January 2014.  Judge Shaerf noted  that
    the First-tier Judge found that the Appellants could  not  satisfy  the
    requirements of the  Immigration  Rules  regardless  of  whether  their
    application was made before or after the change in  the  Rules  on  9th
    July 2012.  It was therefore an arguable  error  to  have  allowed  the
    appeal under section EX of the Immigration Rules which is not  relevant
    to  entry  clearance  applications.  Judge  Shaerf  further  noted  the
    Respondent's argument that the Immigration  Rules  provide  a  complete
    code for the assessment of claims  under  Article  8  of  the  European
    Convention.  The Court of Appeal in MF (Nigeria) v SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ
    1192 found that the Rules were a complete code for  the  assessment  of
    such claims when made in relation to a decision to deport.   The  court
    did not extend that finding to other parts of  the  Immigration  Rules.
    The grounds further challenged the judge's reasoning and argue that  he
    failed to identify any compelling circumstances which would justify the
    grant of entry clearance.  However, Judge Shaerf pointed out  that  the
    grounds failed to take account that in the assessment of  claims  under
    Article 8 the principles enunciated by the House of Lords  in  Huang  v
    SSHD [2007] UKHL 11 remain good law and the relevant yardstick  remains
    one of "reasonableness" and not "compelling  circumstances".   Although
    permission to appeal was granted, Judge Shaerf suggested that  at  that
    stage the Respondent may wish to consider the overall position based on
    the First-tier Judge's findings of fact which had not been  challenged.
    It  would  appear  that  the  Respondent  declined  to  take  up   this
    suggestion.

 7. That is the procedural route by which the matter came before me for  an
    error of law hearing in the  Upper  Tribunal  on  3rd  September  2014.
    Representation was as  mentioned  above.   I  had  before  me  all  the
    documentation which was before the First-tier Tribunal.  In addition, I
    have been helpfully supplied with a bundle of  recent  decisions  which
    includes the judgment of the Court of Appeal in MM v SSHD  [2014]  EWCA
    Civ 985.

 8. Having heard submissions by both advocates I reserved my decision which
    I now give.

 9. As I have already mentioned, the  original  refusal  was  on  financial
    grounds  under  the  Immigration  Rules.   The  application  was   also
    considered under Article 8 of the ECHR but  the  Respondent  considered
    that whilst there may be a perceived interference with the  Appellants'
    right to family life under Article 8, such interference  was  justified
    for the purpose of maintaining effective immigration  control  and  was
    therefore proportionate to the legitimate aim.

10. Judge Colyer noted that  the  first  Appellant  and  the  Sponsor  were
    married and had a child born in Ethiopia (the second Appellant) in June
    2012.  As a consequence of the child's birth, an application for  entry
    clearance which would have been ready to have been submitted before 9th
    July 2012 could not be made due to the fact that  the  first  Appellant
    could not travel to the UK at a late stage of pregnancy.   Furthermore,
    she was unable to complete an English language test.   The  Appellants'
    representatives argued that the birth of the second  Appellant  outside
    the UK was a factor which justified a favourable decision under Article
    8 and that by the date of the appeal in  the  First-tier  Tribunal  the
    financial requirements could be satisfied.

11. Judge Colyer found the Sponsor to be a credible witness  and  that  the
    documents which he had produced were  reliable.   Cogent  reasons  have
    been given in support of these findings.

12. The Sponsor is an Eritrean  national  who  has  been  recognised  as  a
    refugee in the UK.  It is the Sponsor's case that he met the  Appellant
    whilst he was in Sudan  having  escaped  from  Eritrea  in  2008.   The
    Appellant was on a family holiday and they met by chance in  a  church.
    They became friends and continued to meet at  the  church  on  a  daily
    basis.  By the time the Appellant was due to return home a relationship
    had developed between them.  The Sponsor  finally  entered  the  UK  in
    December 2009.  Initially he was detained but following his release  he
    re-established  contact  with  the  Appellant  and  their  relationship
    continued.  The Sponsor was granted refugee status  in  November  2010.
    Thereafter he obtained a travel document and went to Ethiopia where  he
    and the Appellant married on 22nd September 2011.  The Sponsor  was  in
    Ethiopia between 6th September 2011 and 1st November 2011.  As  already
    mentioned, the second Appellant was born in Ethiopia on 4th June  2012.



13. Judge Colyer noted that the  Sponsor  conceded  that  at  the  date  of
    application  he  did  not  meet  the  financial  requirements  of   the
    Immigration Rules.  However, by the date  of  the  appeal  hearing  his
    earnings  had  increased  to  a  level  which  exceeded   the   minimum
    requirement of the Rules but the judge rightly  pointed  out  that  the
    relevant date  for  consideration  of  the  evidence  is  the  date  of
    application.  The judge  also  concluded  that  since  the  Appellants'
    applications were not made until after  the  amended  Rules  came  into
    force on 9th July 2012 they were required to satisfy the current  Rules
    and did not benefit from any interim concessions.  I am satisfied  that
    as a matter of law the First-tier Judge was correct in this conclusion.



14. Judge Colyer went on to consider the exception to Appendix FM contained
    in section EX.  EX.1 applies  if  the  applicant  has  a  "genuine  and
    subsisting relationship with a partner  who  is  in  the  UK  ...  with
    refugee leave, and there are insurmountable obstacles  to  family  life
    with that partner continuing outside the UK".  Judge Colyer found  that
    there were such insurmountable obstacles  for  the  reasons  which  are
    mentioned at paragraph  41  of  the  determination.   In  summary,  the
    reasons are that the Sponsor is an Eritrean with refugee status.  As an
    Eritrean he cannot be expected to reside in neighbouring  countries  to
    Eritrea, such as Sudan and Ethiopia, because there is a real risk  that
    he would be deported back to Eritrea.  Eritreans in Ethiopia have  been
    kept in detention camps.  While the Sponsor has been able to remain  in
    Ethiopia legally for short periods he would not  be  granted  permanent
    status.  Judge Colyer found that the  Sponsor  would  not  be  able  to
    reside permanently as part  of  the  Appellants'  family  in  Ethiopia.
    Therefore  the  Appellants  have  established  an  exception   to   the
    requirements to meet Appendix FM.

15. Judge Colyer has noted the Tribunal's obligation to take account of the
    welfare of children and he has also considered Article 8 in  accordance
    with the well-known five step approach advocated  by  Lord  Bingham  in
    Razgar.  This  is  a  careful  and  comprehensive  determination  which
    discloses a thorough examination of the Appellants' claim.

16. Both representatives made helpful  submissions.   For  the  Respondent,
    Miss Johnstone submitted that the First-tier  Judge  erred  in  law  in
    applying paragraph EX1 for the reasons which are set out in the grounds
    in support of the application for permission  to  appeal.   She  argued
    that this misapplication had infected the overall Article 8 assessment.
     She argued that the First-tier Judge had failed to apply the  guidance
    given in the recent decisions in Nagre and Gulshan.

17. For the Appellants, Mr Royston relied  upon  a  supplementary  skeleton
    argument and emphasised the following points.

18. When granting permission to appeal, Designated Judge Shaerf had pointed
    out that in an assessment of claims under Article 8 the decision of the
    House of Lords  in  Huang  remains  good  law  and  that  the  relevant
    yardstick   is   one   of   reasonableness   rather   than   compelling
    circumstances.  Mr Royston submitted  that  the  First-tier  Judge  had
    identified  factors  well  recognised  as   amounting   to   compelling
    circumstances.  In the present case there are:

       . The second Appellant is a young child.

       . There are insurmountable obstacles to family life being  maintained
         outside the UK.

       . The Sponsor has been recognised as a refugee.

19. Mr Royston argued that Nagre and Gulshan were cases where there were no
    children, it was practicable for  the  family  unit  to  live  together
    outside the UK and the family unit was living precariously in the UK.

20. He also emphasised that the Respondent does not challenge  any  of  the
    First-tier Judge's findings of fact.  He argued that the  present  case
    involves the separation of a young child from her father and that makes
    the circumstances of the case even more "compelling", resulting  in  an
    outcome which would be unjustifiably harsh.

21. Finally, Mr Royston relied upon the very recent guidance given  by  the
    Court of Appeal in MM v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 985 where it was held -

         "Nagre does not add anything to the debate, save for the  statement
         that if a particular person is outside the  Rule  then  he  has  to
         demonstrate, as a preliminary to a consideration outside the  Rule,
         that he has an arguable case and there  may  be  good  grounds  for
         granting leave to remain outside the  Rules.   I  cannot  see  much
         utility in imposing  this  further,  intermediary,  test.   If  the
         applicant cannot satisfy the Rule, then there either is or there is
         not a further Article 8 claim.  That will have to be determined  by
         the relevant decision-maker".

22. In the light of this very clear guidance Mr Royston  submitted  that  a
    failure to apply a threshold case cannot amount to an error of law.   I
    agree with this submission.

23. I have concluded that the making of  the  decision  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal did not involve the making of an error on a point of  law.   I
    therefore uphold the determination in its entirety.  I direct that  the
    order for anonymity made previously shall continue.
