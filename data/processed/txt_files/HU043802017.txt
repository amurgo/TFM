Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is the appeal of Omar Faruk, a  citizen  of  Bangladesh  born  2
       September 1980, against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal of 19
       November 2018, dismissing his appeal, itself brought (in form, though
       as explained below, effectively the appeal  arises  from  an  earlier
       decision) against the refusal of his application for further leave as
       a student of 27 February 2017.


  Background to the present appeal proceedings


    2. The immigration history  supplied  by  the  Respondent  is  that  the
       Appellant arrived in the UK on 25 January 2010 as a Tier  4  student,
       which was extended on 31 January 2013  until  22  January  2015.  The
       Respondent stated that on 5 May 2013 his leave was curtailed so as to
       expire on 22 July 2014. On 25 January 2015  he  applied  for  further
       leave outside the Immigration Rules, which was refused  on  29  March
       2015.

    3. He brought judicial review proceedings against  that  refusal,  which
       were settled on the  basis  that  the  parties  agreed  that  it  was
       appropriate to recognise a right of appeal.

    4. In his statement  supporting  his  judicial  review  application  the
       Appellant stated that he had been unable  to  obtain  a  CAS  from  a
       Sponsor within the available time, and had requested the Home  Office
       to provide a new CAS over a six months period; however  this  request
       had been ignored. He stressed that on 5 June 2013 his representatives
       had requested that UKVI confirm his Sponsor's status.  He  had  never
       subsequently  received  any  notice  of  his   leave's   curtailment,
       notwithstanding the references in his immigration history as supplied
       by the Secretary of State to such a decision having been made.

    5. Judge King refused permission for judicial review in a decision which
       nevertheless  recorded  the  settlement  of   the   judicial   review
       proceedings. Judge  King  noted  that  the  Secretary  of  State  had
       proposed a Consent Order withdrawing her decision of 29 March 2015 on
       the basis that it was appropriate  to  reconsider  the  case  and  to
       recognise a right of appeal if the application was again  refused  on
       reconsideration,  albeit  without  accepting  that  the   curtailment
       decision was unlawful.

    6.  The  refusal  letter  of  27  February  2017   flowing   from   that
       reconsideration did not accept that  the  Appellant  had  established
       very significant obstacles to integration to life  in  Bangladesh  or
       that there were any exceptional circumstances  requiring  him  to  be
       granted leave to remain: his wish to complete his studies in  the  UK
       was deemed insufficient and would put him in a better  position  than
       other students

  The First-tier Tribunal decision below


    7. The Appellant appealed, essentially arguing that he should receive an
       opportunity to  find  another  Sponsor  within  a  60-day  period  as
       contemplated by the Home Office policy addressing  the  circumstances
       of students whose Sponsor had lost their licence. He explained to the
       First-tier Tribunal that on 31 January 2013 he  had  made  a  Tier  4
       application on the basis of studying  at  UK  Education  Professional
       College (UKEPC) to whom he paid fees of �4,000; he had found  it  via
       internet research, and had paid a consultancy firm,  Zaaha  Solution,
       �4,000, on 28 January 2013, to meet the college's fees and to  secure
       him a CAS.

    8. His course was due to start on 12 February 2013, though his leave was
       not granted until 19 March 2013. He had paid for the course  by  this
       time. He had learned that UKEPC was no longer  on  the  Sponsor  list
       from its website; he then discovered the college  was  shut  when  he
       went there in person on 25 March 2013. He contacted Zaaha Solution at
       the end of March 2013; they said they could not reach anyone from the
       college. He attempted to find another  Sponsor  but  they  would  not
       offer a place to a  person  without  leave  to  remain.  He  had  not
       reported Zaaha to the police though he had told his  solicitors  that
       they had taken his money. He had not kept any receipt for  the  money
       he had paid Zaaha.

    9. The First-tier Tribunal rejected the Appellant's evidence.  It  noted
       the claim on his behalf that his  leave  had  been  curtailed  on  24
       October 2013, but that there was no evidence to demonstrate this; the
       Respondent had maintained that the curtailment date was 5  May  2013.
       The Appellant had struggled to remember the name of the course he had
       applied for at UKEPC. It was not credible he would not  have  kept  a
       receipt for the  �4,000  in  funds  that  he  handed  over  to  Zaaha
       Solutions, nor that he would have failed to check whether  Zaaha  had
       actually paid his fees to the college. A letter from  Zaaha  Solution
       of July 2014 in the Appellant's supporting evidence indicated that he
       had reverted to them for further services, which  was  not  plausible
       had they failed to repay him the �4,000. He had  not  approached  the
       Home Office to actively seek a 60-day letter.

   10. The Tribunal concluded that his evidence could not be relied on,  and
       was not established as having paid �4,000 to Zaaha Solution.  He  was
       found to have been aware of  his  leave's  curtailment.  He  had  not
       adequately evidenced his asserted attempts  to  find  an  alternative
       Sponsor, having only listed a series of colleges and universities  to
       which his application had been sent. The authority of Syed was  noted
       for  the  proposition  that  actual  service  was  required  for   an
       immigration decision to be effective; however there was  no  credible
       evidence that the Appellant was not living at the address in question
       at the relevant time.

   11. The Judge noted the authorities demonstrating that an extended period
       of study in the UK could amount  to  private  life  but  that  little
       weight would be attached to it where a  person's  immigration  status
       was consistently precarious, as was  the  case  here.  The  Appellant
       could reasonably be expected to return to his  family  in  Bangladesh
       who had consistently sponsored his leave in the UK.  Accordingly  the
       appeal was dismissed.

  Onwards appeal to the Upper Tribunal


   12. Grounds of appeal argued that the First-tier Tribunal  erred  in  law
       because

      a) It failed to have regard to the authorities such as Mehmood
         requiring that notice be served in writing to the person affected
         and that the burden of proof was on the Secretary of State to
         establish this;

      b) There was no adequate reasoning on credibility and it appeared
         that a lack of corroboration had been held against the Appellant;

      c) The Judge had effectively found the Appellant to have fabricated
         evidence which was not a matter which had been put to him;

      d) No reference was made to letters from Zahaa and another
         organisation confirming that the Appellant required a 60-day
         letter before any Sponsor would accept him as a student;

      e) The assessment of private life was inadequate, brief and flawed.


   13. Whilst the First-tier Tribunal refused permission  to  appeal  on  13
       December 2018, the UT granted permission on 20 February 2019  on  the
       basis that it was arguable that the question of the  service  of  the
       curtailment  decision  was  relevant  to  the   assessment   of   the
       Appellant's private life claim.


   14. Before me Mr Whitwell for the Secretary of State indicated that there
       was important information which the Upper Tribunal should receive. He
       could not say why this  had  been  overlooked  when  the  appeal  was
       presented on the  Secretary  of  State's  behalf  in  the  First-tier
       Tribunal. He then made helpful submissions based on the true state of
       affairs as to attempts to serve the curtailment decision as  revealed
       by the CID database, which confirmed that a letter of 24 October 2013
       was sent to the 17 Preston Street address in Brighton, as shown by  a
       recorded delivery slip. The Royal Mail had returned  that  letter  to
       the Home Office during November 2013 on the basis that the letter had
       not been collected, nobody having signed for  it  when  an  attempted
       delivery was made at the 17 Preston Street. That same letter was  re-
       issued on 19 May 2014, and returned to the Home  Office  on  10  July
       2014 for the same reasons as previously. Therefore it was decided  to
       serve the decision to file. Apex Law  were  recorded  as  having  had
       confirmed the Appellant's correct address.

   15. Mr Swain recognised that the Appellant could achieve no more from the
       appeal process  than  identifying  a  defect  with  the  Home  Office
       decision  making   requiring   the   application   to   be   lawfully
       reconsidered.

  Decision and reasons

   16. It can be seen from the  Chronology  above  that  the  February  2017
       decision against which this appeal ostensibly lies was in fact simply
       the remaking of an earlier inadequate decision of 29 March 2015. Thus
       the decision ultimately appealed against was not one to which the new
       "relevant" provisions of the Nationality Immigration and  Asylum  Act
       2002 have application; because the application was made (and refused)
       other than on human rights grounds and prior to  6  April  2015.  The
       Immigration Act 2014 (Commencement No.  4,  Transitional  and  Saving
       Provisions and Amendment) Order 2015 inserts Article 9(1)(c)(iv) into
       Commencement Order  No.  3  such  that  the  "saved"  provisions  are
       preserved in relation to "a decision made before 6th  April  2015  in
       relation to which, immediately before 6th April 2015, an appeal could
       have been brought or was pending under the saved provisions."

   17. Thus the instant appeal is one brought under the saved provisions  of
       the Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act  2002  against  the  March
       2015 decision. Accordingly there  are  more  grounds  of  appeal  and
       potential arguments available to the Appellant that would  have  been
       the case on a new-style appeal under  the  "relevant  provisions"  of
       that statute. Those include the "not  in  accordance  with  the  law"
       ground of appeal.

   18. Without the injection of the further  information  from  Mr  Whitwell
       regarding the fortunes of the Secretary of State's attempt  to  serve
       the notice of decision on that, Mr Faruk's appeal's  prospects  would
       have been very limited. However, the new revelations demonstrate that
       the First-tier Tribunal made a significant error of fact amounting to
       an error of law, for which the Appellant  was  not  responsible.  The
       First-tier Tribunal believed the Appellant  had  received  notice  of
       curtailment, when in fact the letter seeking to inform  him  of  that
       decision had  been  returned  to  the  post  office.  The  First-tier
       Tribunal's error was caused by the failure of the Secretary of  State
       to  disclose  important  information  available  on  the  information
       database available (only) to  him  that  was  highly  relevant  to  a
       central issue on the appeal.

   19. Although it is readily apparent that other  matters  weighed  on  the
       mind of the Judge below than just the issue of  service,  it  is  not
       possible to say with confidence that the Appellant's denial of having
       received notification of the curtailment  decision  would  have  been
       rejected had the true  circumstances  been  known  to  the  Judge.  I
       accordingly find that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal must be
       set aside.

   20. In the circumstances and given the position of the parties before me,
       it is appropriate to go on and to remake the decision on this appeal.



   21. At the time of Syed (curtailment of leave - notice) India [2013] UKUT
       144 (IAC), the Tribunal was able to issue a decision whose effect  is
       expressed in the following headnote:

         "(1) The Immigration (Notices) Regulations 2003 do not apply  to  a
         decision  under  the  Immigration  Act  1971,  which  is   not   an
         immigration decision within  the  meaning  of  section  82  of  the
         Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.
         (2)  There is no statutory instrument under the  1971  Act  dealing
         with the means of giving notice for the purposes of section 4(1) of
         a decision under that Act, which is not an immigration decision.
         (3)  Accordingly, the Secretary of State has to be  able  to  prove
         that notice of such a  decision  was  communicated  to  the  person
         concerned, in order for it to be effective. Communication  will  be
         effective if made to a person authorised  to  receive  it  on  that
         person's behalf: see Hosier v Goodall [1962] 1 All E.R. 30; but the
         Secretary of State cannot rely upon deemed postal service."

   22. Applying this approach,  given  that  the  curtailment  decision  was
       indeed one which was not appealable and  so  was  not  deemed  served
       under the Notice  Regulations,  one  might  think  that  a  purported
       notification that left its subject unaware of  the  decision  due  to
       their having left the country would be ineffective, leaving the leave
       sought to be curtailed intact.


   23. However, as discussed in Shoaib [2015] EWHC 2010 (Admin),  the  legal
       framework that had that consequence altered via the  introduction  of
       Article 8ZA of the 2000 Order (as amended by The  Immigration  (Leave
       to Enter and Remain (Amendment) Order 2013, which came into force  on
       12th July 2013) such that it is now provided:

           "8ZA.- Grant, refusal or variation of leave by notice in writing
           (1) A notice in writing- ...
           (d) varying a person's leave to enter or remain in the United
           Kingdom,
           may be given to the person affected as required by section 4(1)
           of the Act as follows.
           (2) The notice may be-
           (c) sent by postal service to a postal address provided for
           correspondence by the person or the person's representative;
           8ZB.- Presumptions about receipt of notice
           (1) Where a notice is sent in accordance with article 8ZA, it
           shall be deemed to have been given to the person affected,
           unless the contrary is proved-
           (a) where the notice is sent by postal service-
           (i) on the second day after it was sent by postal service in
           which delivery or receipt is recorded if sent to a place within
           the United Kingdom;
           (ii) on the 28th day after it was posted if sent to a place
           outside the United Kingdom;
           (b) where the notice is sent by fax, e-mail, document exchange
           or courier, on the day it was sent."

   24. So in these circumstances, the 2000  Order  appears  to  entitle  the
       Secretary of State to rely upon deemed, rather than actual,  service.
       Of course, in general in English law notice of  a  decision  must  be
       given before it can have the character of a determination with  legal
       effect, as emphasised by Lord Steyn in Anufrijeva [2004] 1 AC 604  at
       [26]:


         "26. The  arguments  for  the  Home  Secretary  ignore  fundamental
         principles of our law. Notice of a decision is required  before  it
         can have the character of a determination with legal effect because
         the individual concerned must be in a  position  to  challenge  the
         decision in the courts if he or she wishes to do so. This is not  a
         technical rule. It is simply an application of the right of  access
         to justice. That is a fundamental and constitutional  principle  of
         our legal system ..."


   25. However, I do not understand that Anufrijeva  is  authority  for  the
       proposition that deemed notice provisions are ineffective. There  the
       underlying facts were that the Secretary of State  had  a  policy  of
       deferring the communication of a refusal of asylum  decision  pending
       the immigration service's final decision on the grant or  refusal  of
       leave to enter. But in this case, the Secretary of State had made two
       attempts at timely notification. Had the Secretary of  State  managed
       to explain this to the First-tier Tribunal, it might not  have  erred
       in the manner it did.


   26. However, wherever the burden of proof in fact lay, the fact that  the
       Secretary of State failed to provide the First-tier Tribunal with the
       true facts as to service, undermines the  cogency  of  the  reasoning
       below.

   27. The relevant Home Office Guidance around the time of the  curtailment
       decision in relation to Tier 4  Student  applications  for  leave  to
       remain provided as follows:


           "Where the applicant was assigned a CAS by  the  sponsor  before
           they were removed from the sponsor register, the  applicant  can
           apply to extend their leave. ...
           2. Where the application does not meet the requirements,  refuse
           it.
           3. Where it does meet the requirements, put it on hold. ...
           5. If the student's application has been held and the  sponsor's
           licence is revoked, and the student has been a bona fide student
           and did not participate  in  the  practices  which  led  to  the
           revocation, the options for action depend on the leave that they
           have:
           If  they  still  have  at  least  60  days  permission  to  stay
           remaining, you must curtail their leave so that it  will  expire
           once the period of 60 days has run out. During this 60 days they
           can seek a new CAS from a  different  sponsor  and  either  vary
           their application, make a new application or leave  the  UK.  If
           their permission to stay runs out whilst they are waiting for  a
           decision on their application you  must  delay  the  refusal  of
           their application for 60 days to allow them to seek  a  new  CAS
           from a different sponsor and vary their leave."


   28. Decisions such as Thakur [2011] UKUT 151 (IAC) demonstrate that  Home
       Office policy is not to penalise students who bear no  responsibility
       for the failings of a Sponsor. The decision of March 2015, upon which
       the refusal letter of February 2017 relied, had  failed  to  consider
       whether the Appellant  should  have  received  the  benefit  of  this
       policy. It seems to me that the whole chain of Home Office  decisions
       is undermined by this failure. Thus the decision  making  is  not  in
       accordance with the law and the appeal must be allowed.


   29. The Appellant's  application  of  January  2015  accordingly  remains
       outstanding before the Secretary of State.  The  Secretary  of  State
       must now consider whether it is appropriate to issue a 60 day  letter
       in the light of the facts above.

          Decision:

     1) The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains a  material  error
        of law.
     2) The decision of the Secretary of State that was the subject of  the
        appeal to the First-tier Tribunal and the Upper Tribunal was not in
        accordance with the law.
     3) Accordingly I allow the Appellant's appeal.


       Signed:                                             Date:  20   March
