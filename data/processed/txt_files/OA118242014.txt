For the Respondent:    Mr C Avery - Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by Mrs Azeezat Abiodun Fasinro, a citizen of  Nigeria
    born 1st July 1990.

 2. She appeals against the determination of First-tier Tribunal Judge A  A
    Wilson issued on 22nd May 2015 dismissing under the  Immigration  Rules
    and on human rights grounds her appeal  against  the  decision  of  the
    Respondent made on 23rd August 2014 to refuse leave to enter the United
    Kingdom as a partner under Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.

 3. On 1st September 2015 First-tier Tribunal Judge Cox granted  permission
    to appeal.  He said:
         "2.  I have carefully considered the decision in  relation  to  the
             grounds.  The grounds in essence contend that the  Judge  made
             inconsistent findings in his decision and also  erred  in  his
             finding on the English language requirements.
         3.   On consideration, I do find  the  decision  read  as  a  whole
             somewhat confused and confusing.  It is also worrying that the
             Judge at [9] referred to cross-examination by  the  Presenting
             Officer when no such Officer was in attendance (as the  Record
             of Proceedings confirms).  The losing party is always entitled
             to a clear indication why he or she has lost and,  altogether,
             it is arguable that the decision is deficient in that  respect
             and accordingly unsafe."

 4. In a response to the grounds the Secretary of State submits that  Judge
    Wilson directed himself appropriately and made reasonable,  sustainable
    findings that were properly  open  to  him  on  the  evidence.   It  is
    submitted that the grounds advanced by the Appellant are  nothing  more
    than a disagreement with the negative outcome of his appeal.  The grant
    of permission for leave is on the basis that the determination  of  the
    Judge was confusing and contained inconsistencies when cross-referenced
    with the Record of Proceedings.

 5. However, given that the Respondent does not have access to  the  Record
    of Proceedings the Respondent is not in a position to respond to  these
    grounds nor to concede  any  error  in  this  regard.   The  Respondent
    further submits that the determination does  not  on  the  face  of  it
    disclose any material arguable errors of law.

 6. The Respondent  gave  three  reasons  for  dismissing  the  Appellant's
    application.   Firstly  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  (ECO)  was  not
    satisfied that the relationship is genuine and subsisting; secondly  he
    was not satisfied that the Sponsor's income was ï¿½33,000  per  annum  as
    claimed because the bank  statements  and  payslips  did  not  carry  a
    complete sequence and there was no employment letter; thirdly there was
    nothing to confirm that the Appellant could be adequately  accommodated
    without recourse to public funds; the final reason was the  failure  to
    submit an English language certificate.

 7. Judge Wilson concluded that the marriage was genuine.  He  looked  very
    thoroughly at the payslips and the bank  statements  and  he  gave  the
    Appellant the benefit of some doubt and accepted that on the balance of
    probabilities the  appropriate  documents  relative  to  the  Sponsor's
    earnings had been submitted to the ECO by  the  date  of  decision.  He
    found that the financial  requirements  had  been  met.    He  was  not
    however satisfied that the degree certificate, the  evidence  that  the
    English language requirement was met, had been submitted to the ECO  at
    that time.  The Sponsor had indeed accepted that it was later than that
    because the award ceremony had not been until July 2014.

 8. One of the requirements relative to the language requirements  is  that
    the course has to be taught in English.  The  Appellant  had  belatedly
    provided a degree certificate from Nigeria.  Judge Wilson  clearly  had
    some difficulty with this because he  had  formed  the  view  that  the
    language requirement was met but that the necessary  evidence  had  not
    been before the ECO at the requisite date.  He said at paragraph 17:
         "In short,  whilst  I  have  very  considerable  sympathy  for  the
         Appellant and her husband and I am satisfied that  the  appropriate
         evidence could now be lodged, overall  I  find  the  appeal  cannot
         succeed under the Immigration Rules."

 9. He went on to consider Article 8.  He relied on Secretary of State v SS
    (Congo) and Others [2015] EWCA Civ 387 in  concluding  with  regard  to
    Article 8 ECHR that there was no justification  for  dealing  with  the
    appeal outwith the Immigration Rules.  He gave sound reasons for this.

10. Much was made in the grounds seeking permission of  a  submission  that
    the Judge was contradictory in that he found  that  the  Appellant  did
    meet the English language requirements and then found that she did  not
    meet the requirements of the Rules because all  the  relevant  evidence
    was not with the ECO at the date of decision.  There was little dispute
    at the hearing before me about this finding.  It seemed to be  accepted
    that evidence that the English language requirements were met  was  not
    with the ECO when he made the decision.  It does appear to be the  case
    that the Judge does refer in paragraph 9 to  cross-examination  by  the
    Home Office Presenting Officer when no Home Office  Presenting  Officer
    apparently attended.  He does give the name of a Presenting Officer  on
    the front page of his decision under "Representation".

Findings on error of law

11. I do not accept that there was an inconsistency in what the Judge  said
    about  the   English   language   certificate.    There   was   nothing
    contradictory in  saying  that  clearly  the  Appellant  can  meet  the
    requirement but that at the date of decision she had not established by
    the required evidence that she did, thus failing  to  comply  with  the
    Immigration Rules.

12. In the Record of Proceedings for the hearing on 11th May 2015  it  does
    indicate  that  there  was  no  Presenting  Officer.   It  was  clearly
    therefore an error for the Judge to say that the Appellant  was  cross-
    examined but I do not consider this to be material.  In  essence  Judge
    Wilson found that the Appellant did not meet the  requirements  of  the
    Rules.  It seems that this decision was correct.  He then had to decide
    whether or not, having considered SS (Congo),  it  was  appropriate  to
    consider the appeal outwith the Rules.  He found that it was not and he
    gave proper and reasonable reasons for this.

Decision

I  find  therefore  that  there  is  no  material  error  of  law   in   the
determination of the First-tier Tribunal and that decision shall stand.

No anonymity direction is made.
