Solicitors)
For the Respondent:    Mr N Bramble (Senior Home Office Presenting Officer)

                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is the appeal of Fahad Naseem, a citizen  of  Pakistan  born  15
       August 1981, against the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  of  12
       February 2016 to dismiss his appeal against, in turn, the decision of
       30 January 2015 to refuse his application for further leave to remain
       on human rights grounds.


    2. The immigration history supplied  by  the  Respondent  was  that  the
       Appellant entered the country as a  student  and  was  granted  leave
       until 31 March  2010,  and  after  a  brief  interregnum  after  some
       extension applications failed, again until  25  May  2011.  A  spouse
       application was refused on 20 May 2011, and  an  application  outside
       the Rules led to a grant of Discretionary  Leave  to  Remain  from  9
       November 2011 to 9 November 2014. The present application was made on
       2 October 2014.


    3.  The  application,  to  remain  on  the  basis  of  the   Appellant's
       relationship with his wife [SB] who he married on 23 June  2011,  was
       refused because it was  not  accepted  that  their  relationship  was
       genuine  and  subsisting.  Following  answers  given  at  a  marriage
       interview, the Secretary of State had concerns as to the veracity  of
       their relationship. The application was additionally refused  because
       relevant specified evidence had not been supplied as to the financial
       and English language requirements.


    4. It was accepted before the First-tier Tribunal that the financial and
       English language requirements were not satisfied,  given  that  there
       was no employer's  letter  or  payslips  and  bank  statements  as  a
       certificate from Trinity  College  of  September  2011  predated  the
       application by more than two years.


    5.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  considered  the  evidence   as   to   the
       relationship being genuine and subsisting  and  found  that  it  was,
       given the extent and consistency of the information before it. As  to
       their daily routine, the layout of their home, and recent significant
       events in their shared lives, any alleged inconsistencies  identified
       by the refusal letter were not significant. As  the  Appellant  could
       not satisfy the five year route to settlement, it  was  necessary  to
       demonstrate insurmountable obstacles to relocation to Pakistan.


    6. The First-tier Tribunal did not,  however,  accept  that  there  were
       insurmountable obstacles to the couple's relocation  abroad,  because
       [SB] admitted that she would relocate to Pakistan  if  required,  and
       had  limited  ties  here  given  that  her  family  had  opposed  her
       relationship with her husband meaning she  had  become  more  distant
       from them; she had not worked since July 2015 and  had  no  immediate
       job connections here; the couple lived in rental property  here.  She
       could communicate with her husband in Pakistan, whether  or  not  she
       would be able to speak Urdu fluently to other people.


    7. Her migraines, which had led to her ending work with Cordant Security
       in July 2015, were not considered  sufficiently  serious  to  require
       medical treatment that could only be provided in this country.


    8. There were no very significant obstacles to integration  in  Pakistan
       now, given he had always been present  on  a  precarious  basis,  his
       mother remained living there, and there  were  no  ties  between  his
       relationship with [SB] itself.  There  was  no  requirement  to  look
       beyond the Rules as there were no relevant and weighty considerations
       present which they did not deal with.


    9. Grounds of appeal argued  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  had  taken
       wholly the wrong approach in  considering  the  application  only  in
       relation to Appendix FM and Rule 276ADE, for as he had  been  granted
       Discretionary Leave to Remain before 9 July 2012 he had in fact  been
       entitled to proceed to settlement  subject  to  the  general  refusal
       reasons, without regard to the new Rules. The Respondent was culpable
       for failing to put forward the relevant policy guidance.


   10. Permission to appeal was granted on 5 August 2016 by  the  First-tier
       Tribunal on the basis that these grounds appeared to have force.


   11. Before me the advocates were in agreement that the appeal  should  be
       allowed to the extent that the original decision  was  identified  as
       not in accordance with the law.


Findings and reasons


   12. The Respondent's guidance relating to cases of this nature sets out:


           "Transitional Arrangements
           . All decisions made on Discretionary Leave on or after  9  July
           2012  will  be  subject  to  the  criteria  set  out   in   this
           guidance....
           Applicants granted Discretionary Leave before 9 July 2012
           . Those who, before 9 July 2012, have been granted  leave  under
           the DL policy in force at the time will normally continue to  be
           dealt with under that  policy  through  to  settlement  if  they
           qualify for it (normally after accruing 6 years continuous  DL).
           Further leave applications from those granted up to 3  years  DL
           before 9 July 2012 are subject to an active review.
           . Consideration  of  all  further  leave  applications  will  be
           subject to a  criminality  check  and  the  application  of  the
           criminality thresholds, including in respect of cases awaiting a
           decision on a further period of DL on that date. See Criminality
           and Exclusion section above.
           .  Decision  makers  must  consider  whether  the  circumstances
           prevailing at the time of the original grant of  leave  continue
           at the date of the decision. If  the  circumstances  remain  the
           same and the criminality thresholds  do  not  apply,  a  further
           period of 3 years DL should normally be granted. Decision makers
           must consider whether  there  are  any  circumstances  that  may
           warrant
           departure from the standard period of  leave.  See  section  4.4
           above."

   13. The finding that the relationship was not a  genuine  one  has  been
       reversed on appeal. Accordingly the Appellant, being  a  person  who
       was previously granted  leave  to  remain  under  this  policy,  has
       clearly had his case for an extension of leave pursuant to its terms
       assessed  on  the  wrong  factual  basis.  He  was  entitled  to  an
       assessment under the terms of the published  policy,  on  the  basis
       that "the circumstances remain[ed] the same [and] a  further  period
       of 3 years DL should normally be granted."


   14. As noted in Aladeselu & Ors (2006 Regs - reg 8) Nigeria [2011]  UKUT
       253 (IAC) at [31] (in the context of a discretion found  within  The
       Immigration (European Economic  Area)  Regulations  2006  but  as  I
       understand it expressing a principle of more  general  application),
       the  jurisdiction  of  the  Tribunal  to  review  the  exercise   of
       discretion under section 86(3)(b) of the Nationality Immigration and
       Asylum Act  2002,  because  "a  discretion  exercised  in  making  a
       decision against which the appeal is brought or is treated as  being
       brought should have been exercised differently", is a  limited  one:
       "Whilst we can consider whether a discretionary  power  should  have
       been exercised differently, we cannot seek to do that if  there  has
       as yet been no exercise of that power. It follows  that  the  appeal
       can only be allowed to the extent that it remains outstanding before
       the Secretary of State."


   15. I accordingly find that the decision was not in accordance with  the
       law, the genuine nature of  the  relationship  having  been  wrongly
       rejected, and that the Appellant's application  remains  outstanding
       before the Respondent for lawful determination of the  extension  of
       leave application under the terms of  the  appropriate  Guidance.  I
       allow the Appellant's appeal and substitute for the decision of  the
       First-tier Tribunal my own conclusion, which is that the decision of
       the Respondent was not in accordance  with  the  law  and  that  the
       Appellant's application remains outstanding before her in order  for
       the relevant discretion to be lawfully exercised.

          Decision:

      The appeal to the Upper Tribunal is allowed.
