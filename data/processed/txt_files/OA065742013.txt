                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction

    1. The appellant is a citizen of Ivory  Coast  born  on  11th  November
       1994. In October 2012 (aged 17 years) she applied to join her mother
       (Mrs Robe Sylvie Blandine Lebato) and  her  step-father  (Mr  Tagbeu
       Apollinaire Lebato) in the UK. The application was  refused  on  1st
       February 2013 on  the  basis  that  the  appellant  could  not  meet
       paragraph 297(i)(e) of the Immigration Rules. Her appeal against the
       decision was dismissed by Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  M.D.
       Dennis  in  a  determination  promulgated  on   26th   March   2014.
       Permission to appeal was granted by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal
       Osborne on 19th May 2014 on the basis that it was arguable that  the
       First-tier judge had erred in law. In a decision promulgated on  7th
       July 2014 I found that Judge Dennis had erred in law and  set  aside
       his determination with  no  findings  preserved.  This  decision  is
       appended as Annex A to this determination.

    2. The matter came back to me to re-make the  appeal  de  novo.  In  an
       email dated 9th October 2014 Mr John Parkinson submitted an argument
       to the Tribunal on behalf of the respondent which  argued  that  the
       appellant also did not  qualify  under  paragraph  297  (v)  of  the
       Immigration Rules as  it  was  said  she  could  not  be  maintained
       adequately by her parent  or  parents  without  recourse  to  public
       funds. Mrs Gore only received this  email  from  Mr  Walker  at  the
       hearing. She was given time to take instructions,  and  I  indicated
       that I would be happy for her  to  make  written  submissions,  with
       further evidence if necessary, after  the  hearing  given  the  late
       point at which this matter had been put  in  issue.  Ultimately  Mrs
       Gore said she was happy to deal with it by way of  oral  submissions
       at the hearing; and in any case in submissions  Mr  Walker  conceded
       that the appellant could meet the requirements of  paragraph  297(v)
       of the Immigration Rules.

Evidence & Submissions

    3. Mrs Robe Sylvie Blandine Lebato, mother of the  appellant,  attended
       the Tribunal and gave evidence through the French  interpreter.  She
       confirmed that her own statement was correct and that she understood
       in summary what her husband, Mr Tagbeu Apollinaire Lebato, had  said
       in his new statement and also believed that to be correct.

    4. In summary in her statement Mrs Lebato explains that she  had  lived
       with the appellant, who was  born  outside  of  marriage,  in  Angre
       (Abidjan) in Ivory Coast. She had married Mr Lebato  on  9th  August
       2008 but had continued to live with the  appellant  in  Ivory  Coast
       until March 2011. In March 2011 she had taken a short trip to Cocody
       (another area in Abidjan) to visit her uncle,  Mr  Bouabre  and  his
       family, without the appellant. Civil war had  started  and  she  had
       been unable to return to her home in the Angre district of  Abidjan.
       Her uncle Mr Desire Tagro, who was a Home Office  Minister  at  that
       time, was killed, and her  other  uncle  Mr  Bouabre  (who  was  the
       Minister for economics and finance) had his house burned down.

    5. Mrs Lebato fled to Ghana on 26th March 2011 with Mr Bouabre and  his
       family as they believed the family was in danger.

    6. The appellant went to the French military base  in  Adjufu  (another
       area of Abidjan) with Mrs Lebato's father (who lived nearby) to find
       safety  as  the  rebellion  spread  to  Angre  where  she  and   her
       grandfather lived. After some time the appellant  and  her  maternal
       grandfather had to leave the military base. It was arranged for  the
       appellant to live with her birth father although he  had  played  no
       role in her life up until this time. Mrs Lebato  continued  to  make
       all key decisions in the appellant's life. The appellant only stayed
       in her birth father's house due to the problems caused by the  civil
       war.

    7. Mrs Lebato obtained entry clearance to come to the UK as the  spouse
       of her husband from the British  High  Commission  in  Accra.  Since
       coming to the UK  she  has  sent  money  to  support  the  appellant
       regularly and continued to exercise parental responsibility for her,
       making all major decisions in her life.  She  has  been  the  parent
       making such decisions. She has continued to arrange and pay for  her
       education, which currently is at Mahou Secondary  School  in  Dokui,
       Abidjan.

    8. Mrs Lebato could not visit the  appellant  in  Ivory  Coast  as  she
       became pregnant in the UK. She had a difficult pregnancy;  her  baby
       was born prematurely and then died after six months in hospital. Mrs
       Lebato has kept in touch with the appellant by phone and Skype.  She
       discusses education, her physical and emotional well-being  and  her
       future career prospects.

    9. In June 2013 the appellant moved to San Pedro (another city in Ivory
       Coast) to live with her maternal grandmother  but  this  arrangement
       did not work out as her grandmother was  unkind  due  to  her  being
       illegitimate, and so in September 2013 she  moved  to  be  with  her
       maternal uncle, Mr Serges Guero, in Plateau Dokui  in  Abidjan,  but
       this arrangement was also problematic as the appellant did  not  get
       on well with her uncle's wife.

   10. In cross-examination and response to question  from  me  Mrs  Lebato
       added that she had lived with her daughter continually  until  2011.
       The appellant's father did not take decisions about her  during  the
       period 2011 to 2013 when she resided with him. Since  June  2013  he
       has not had contact with her, and does not speak on  the  telephone.
       She makes very short telephone calls to the appellant because  these
       are just to ask her to connect to Skype. They can then speak for two
       hours for 50p. She speaks via Skype about three times  a  week.  She
       has not visited the appellant since her pregnancy and  tragic  death
       of her second child because she feels that she would only be able to
       stay for two weeks and this would be very difficult as it would  not
       be enough.

   11. Mr Tagbeu Apollinaire Lebato attended the Tribunal and gave evidence
       through the French interpreter.  He confirmed his name, address  and
       that his two statements were true and  correct,  and  he  wished  to
       adopt them as his evidence to the Tribunal.

   12. In  summary  his  statements  say  as  follows.  The  appellant  was
       conceived when her mother was just 15 years old and  her  biological
       father was also under the age of 18 years.  They  were  never  in  a
       proper relationship, and the pregnancy was not  intended.  When  she
       was pregnant Mrs Lebato's father sent her away from Abidjan to  live
       with his family in the village of Saioua.  The appellant was born in
       Saioua, and was brought up by Mrs Lebato alone. There was no contact
       with the biological father who remained  in  Abidjan.  In  1999  the
       appellant and her mother relocated to the Angre suburb  of  Abidjan.
       The appellant's father continued to have absolutely no role  in  her
       upbringing. In June 2008 the appellant met her biological father for
       the first time, but by this time Mr Lebato had become engaged to her
       mother and had taken on the role as father.

   13. Mr Lebato is a British citizen, who has lived in the UK  since  19th
       September 1995. He met  the  appellant's  mother  (Mrs  Robe  Sylvie
       Blandine Lebato) in September 2006 in the Ivory Coast  at  a  dinner
       party organised by her father whilst on a  six  week  holiday.  They
       formed a friendship, and kept in communication. From  this  time  Mr
       Lebato started to provide financial support to his future  wife  and
       the appellant. In September 2007 he returned to Ivory Coast and they
       became engaged. In April 2008 their families met for the traditional
       notification of intention to marry; they had a civil marriage at the
       Registry Commune of Cocody on 9th August 2008 and a full traditional
       marriage ceremony on 10th August 2008. Mr Lebato returned to the  UK
       in September 2008 having spent six weeks with the appellant and  his
       wife. From this point Mr Lebato  provided  emotionally  as  well  as
       financially for the appellant.

   14. Mrs Lebato had always lived with  the  appellant  until  she  became
       separated in March 2011 by the civil war, as is described  above  in
       her statement. Mrs Lebato became a registered refugee  in  Ghana  in
       March 2011. Mr  Lebato  sent  money  to  the  appellant  through  Mr
       Innocent Guero for the appellant, whom he viewed by this time as his
       step-daughter, for her material needs.  Mr  Guero  is  Mrs  Lebato's
       maternal uncle, and someone who was trusted to provide the money  to
       the appellant and who worked in the city so could easily  deal  with
       the money.

   15. Since Mrs Lebato came to the UK she has regularly sent money to  the
       appellant and has continued to make all major decisions in her life.
       Mrs Lebato did not visit the appellant in Ivory Coast as she  became
       pregnant and had a child who died after six months in hospital.  The
       loss of their child and separation from the appellant have seriously
       affected Mrs Lebato. Mrs Lebato has been granted indefinite leave to
       remain in the UK on the basis of their marriage.

   16. In August 2011 Mr and Mrs Lebato decided that  the  appellant  would
       have to reside with her biological father due to the war  situation.
       She had first gone to the French military  base  in  Porte-Bouet  in
       Abidjan with her maternal grandfather with other displaced  persons.
       They stayed there between March and August 2011, when  they  had  to
       leave. The appellant's biological  father  lived  in  Adjouffou,  in
       Porte-Bouet, Abidjan. Mr and Mrs Lebato therefore paid money for the
       upkeep of the  appellant  and  her  biological  father,  as  he  was
       unemployed. Mr Lebato arranged for the appellant to attend a  nearby
       school owned by a friend of his who lives in America, and  paid  the
       school fees.  The appellant's biological father took no decisions on
       the appellant's behalf, and they did not form a bond as she felt  he
       had abandoned her at birth. The arrangement only came about  due  to
       the necessity in the context of a civil war.

   17. In October 2012 the appellant applied to join them in  the  UK,  and
       the application was refused on 1st February 2013. They  continue  to
       pay her school fees at Mahou Secondary School. Mrs  Lebato  and  the
       appellant are very close and talk on the  telephone  and  via  Skype
       regularly. The appellant's natural father has played no role in  her
       life and there is no father/daughter bond despite the time that  she
       lived at his address. A letter of consent to the  appellant  leaving
       Ivory Coast was obtained from the biological father via  Mr  Anselme
       Innocent Guero.

   18. In June 2013 the appellant moved from her biological  father's  home
       to live with her maternal  grandmother  in  San  Pedro,  400km  from
       Abidjan. In September 2013 she moved to her maternal uncle's home in
       Plateau Dokui. Mr and Mrs Lebato continue to be in  regular  contact
       with the appellant.

   19. He and Mrs Lebato have a net total income of  �2200  a  month.  They
       live in a two bedroom property with a living  room.  There  is  more
       than sufficient income and accommodation for the appellant.

   20. In oral evidence Mr Lebato explained that he knew the facts  in  his
       statement about the appellant's early life from his wife;  and  that
       he knew about the appellant since his relationship with his wife  as
       he has been in direct contact with  the  appellant  from  this  time
       onwards. His wife had spoken to the appellant's biological father to
       arrange the accommodation with him when she had to leave the  French
       military base. Mr Lebato had also spoken to him and arranged for the
       financial help and the appellant's schooling in a  school  local  to
       the accommodation which was owned by a friend of his  who  lived  in
       the USA.

   21. The visa application form had not enabled him to give  full  details
       of his wife's income but she worked doing sewing for a  stylist  and
       local community ceremonies, doing hair dressing  and  making  cakes.
       She had survived with her daughter in this way in  Ivory  Coast.  At
       the time of decision she earned about �100 a week from the  workshop
       sewing; about �90 a week by doing hair-dressing  and  about  �40  by
       selling cakes via the church. This was about �230 a week.

   22. In cross-examination Mr Lebato said that the cash payments into  the
       Santander bank statements - for instance on 6th June 2012  and  24th
       July 2012 were his wife's earnings from the above sources. She would
       collect money in a box and  then  pay  it  into  their  account.  He
       himself had no source of income other than his  employment.  It  was
       explained that Mr Lebato's son by a  previous  relationship  was  18
       years old at the time of decision to refuse the appellant,  and  was
       living at another address near his  school  (so  he  had  no  travel
       costs) with a family who wanted their children to learn  English  as
       they had come from France. This family provided Mr Lebato's son with
       food and accommodation for free, and he had  child  benefit  and  an
       educational support grant to provide for his other expenses.

   23. Mr Walker submitted that he did not pursue the argument put  in  the
       email from Mr Parkinson  about  the  appellant  not  fulfilling  the
       financial requirements. It was clear that these had not factored  in
       Mrs Lebato's earnings. He also accepted that  there  was  sufficient
       accommodation as Mr Lebato's son was not living with the family  (or
       causing them  additional  expense)  at  the  time  of  decision.  He
       accepted that Mrs Lebato had provided a credible explanation for the
       short telephone calls to the appellant. He continued  to  rely  upon
       the refusal notice but accepted that the new statement did give more
       detail as to the responsibility Mr and Mrs Lebato had taken for  the
       appellant.

   24. Mrs Gore submitted that she relied upon her skeleton  argument.  She
       submitted that Mrs Lebato had been a single parent from the time  of
       the appellant's birth to 2006. She had supported  the  appellant  by
       dress-making and cake-making. The appellant had been born  when  her
       parents were teenagers, this is  clear  from  the  passport  of  the
       appellant's biological father. From 2006 Mr Lebato had also taken on
       parental responsibility. It was only because of the civil war  which
       left the appellant alone in Ivory Coast, needing  safety  after  she
       had to leave the French military base where  she  had  been  seeking
       safety with her maternal grandfather, that contact was made with the
       appellant's biological father. By this time  she  was  over  sixteen
       years old, and all that was provided was  accommodation  and  not  a
       parental relationship.

   25. When applying TD (Paragraph 297(i)(e):"sole  responsibility")  Yemen
       [2006] UKAIT 00049 it was appropriate to see this  as  a  case  with
       both parents in the UK. Mr Lebato should be seen as the  appellant's
       true father, as parent is not defined by the Immigration  Rules  and
       need not be the biological father. But if it was not  seen  in  this
       way it was an exceptional case as the appellant had  arguably  three
       parents, with her biological father only providing her with a  space
       to stay due to the aftermath of the civil war, which  from  her  own
       statement it was clear the appellant found very  difficult.  It  was
       only the second time her biological father had  seen  her  when  she
       went to stay with him in 2011 at  16  years  and  nine  months.  The
       appellant's biological father had played no role in her life. In the
       context of the civil war that led to their separation the  appellant
       should be seen as someone seeking family reunion with her mother. It
       was appreciated that Mrs Lebato was not formally a refugee in the UK
       however.

   26. At the end of the hearing I reserved my determination.

Conclusions

   27. The respondent concedes that the appellant meets all requirements of
       the Immigration Rules other than sole responsibility under paragraph
       297(i)(e) of the Immigration Rules. I am also satisfied that this is
       the case.

   28. Mrs Gore is not correct to argue that parent is not defined  by  the
       Immigration Rules. A stepfather can only be a parent if  the  father
       is dead, see paragraph 6 of  the  Immigration  Rules.  As  such  the
       parents to be considered in this case are the appellant's mother and
       biological father.

   29. I find Mr and Mrs  Lebato  to  be  credible  witnesses.  Their  oral
       testimony was consistent with their  written  statements,  and  with
       each other, and with the other  documentary  evidence  submitted  by
       themselves and with country of origin evidence, for  instance  about
       the districts of Abidjan and Mrs Lebato's family's involvement  with
       Ivorian politics. They both answered questions directly  and  fully,
       being anxious to assist the Tribunal by providing a detailed picture
       of the appellant's history.

   30. I find that appellant's mother, Mrs Lebato, has been a  constant  in
       taking practical responsibility for the appellant and  has  provided
       control and direction  of  the  appellant's  life  taking  or  being
       involved in all the important decisions.

   31. Mrs Lebato provided for the appellant in all ways from the  time  of
       her birth until she was forced to leave Ivory Coast in  the  context
       of the civil war and find safety  in  neighbouring  Ghana  in  March
       2011, when the appellant was sixteen years old. From  2006  she  was
       assisted in her financial provision for the appellant by the man who
       has become her husband, Mr Lebato, who lives in the United  Kingdom.
       It is clear that Mr and Mrs Lebato married on 9th August  2008  from
       the Ivorian marriage certificate included in the  bundle.  From  the
       time of this marriage I accept that Mr Lebato also took on the  role
       of step-father to the  appellant  in  terms  of  offering  emotional
       support as well as financial provision.

   32. I am satisfied that after her separation from the appellant in  2011
       Mrs Lebato has been in regular telephone and Skype contact,  as  she
       has described (which is supported by the telephone records for Mr  &
       Mrs Lebato from Lebara), and that she has provided emotional support
       to the appellant via these calls as well as dealing  with  practical
       advice and decision-making. Mrs Lebato has not visited the appellant
       having fled as a refugee to Ghana and then having joined her husband
       in the UK. However after entering the UK she had  a  very  difficult
       pregnancy, and suffered the tragic loss  of  her  very  sick  second
       child at six months of age  on  20th  February  2013  (evidenced  by
       medical papers for  Mrs  Lebato,  and  her  son's  birth  and  death
       certificates) just after the decision to refuse the appellant  entry
       clearance. She now cannot  face  having  a  short  period  with  the
       appellant and then having to leave.

   33. I find that since leaving Ivory Coast in March  2011  that  together
       with her husband Mrs Lebato has arranged accommodation  and  day  to
       day  care  for  the  appellant;  she  has  provided  for   financial
       remittances; and made the key  decisions  about  her  education  and
       health. It is notable that there is documentary evidence of  regular
       financial transfers from Ria Holloway to the appellant have been via
       Mr Anselme Guero, Mrs Lebato's brother,  thus  clearly  linking  all
       financial assistance to Mr and Mrs Lebato.

   34. In accordance with TD Yemen my next task is to determine whether the
       appellant's biological father, Mr Oke Alexandre Digbeu,  has  shared
       responsibility for the appellant. My conclusion is that he  has  not
       and did not at the time  of  refusal  of  entry  clearance  for  the
       reasons set out below.

   35. It is clear that the appellant's biological father had absolutely no
       role in the appellant's life until August 2011 when she was  sixteen
       years old and nine months old. He had met her just once in 2008 when
       she was thirteen years old prior to this, and by this time Mr Lebato
       was already a father figure in her life, albeit one who was  present
       via visits and telecommunications rather than a daily presence.

   36. In August 2011 the appellant's biological father was paid to provide
       her with accommodation by Mr and Mrs Lebato as  he  happened  to  be
       living in a safe  are  of  Abidjan  where  the  appellant  could  be
       provided with good schooling, and in a context of the  aftermath  of
       civil war. Whilst the appellant lived with her biological father for
       some time she did not form a bond with him, and  since  leaving  his
       address it is tellingly  that  she  is  no  longer  in  contact  via
       telephone (evidence of Mrs  Lebato).  The  appellant  describes  her
       biological father in her own statement as: "a repugnant  person  and
       we always disagreed and had quarrels as he was unkind to me". She is
       clear that it was her mother and step-father who  provided  for  her
       material needs whilst she stayed with her biological father and that
       he: "never made  any  decisions  in  my  upbringing,  wellbeing  and
       welfare."  This  is  consistent  with  the  appellant's   biological
       father's own letter (which consents to her joining Mr and Mrs Lebato
       and  is  clearly  signed  in  the  original  written  in  French  on
       22/3/2013) which says that Mr and Mrs Lebato  pay  for  her  tuition
       fees, health care and pocket money whilst the appellant  stays  with
       him and that the appellant had  lived  with  her  mother  until  Mrs
       Lebato left Ivory Coast. It is also  notable  that  the  doctor  who
       treated the appellant in July 2012, whilst she was living  with  her
       biological father, refers to her as being distressed by being unwell
       and "living  away  from  her  parents"  (see  letter  of  Dr  Toudou
       Judicael).

   37. As the appellant was living with her biological father at  the  time
       of the  decision  to  refuse  entry  clearance,  so  did  have  some
       involvement in the appellant's  life  to  the  extent  of  providing
       accommodation  and  food,  I  find  that  this  is  a   case   where
       exceptionally  the  appellant's  mother  was   the   parent   solely
       responsible. Although Mrs Lebato shared this responsibility with her
       husband Mr Lebato, who had become the  appellant's  de  facto  step-
       father, he is not deemed to be a parent by  the  Immigration  Rules.
       The active taking of responsibilities by Mr Lebato (for instance  in
       arranging financial transfers, in negotiating financial  support  to
       be provide whilst she the appellant was lodged with  her  biological
       father and finding a school nearby owned by a friend of his) however
       makes the exceptional situation with the appellant's  birth  father,
       that he did not shared parental responsibility with her mother,  all
       the more credible.

   38. I find that there were no other people in  Ivory  Coast  who  shared
       responsibility for the appellant's upbringing with her mother. It is
       clear that whilst accommodation and  meals  have  been  provided  by
       other relatives since March 2011, the appellant's biological  father
       aside, (for instance the appellant's maternal grandfather after  Mrs
       Lebato left Ivory Coast and prior to the decision to refuse, and  by
       her maternal grandmother and uncle after the decision to  refuse)  I
       find that there is no evidence  that  any  of  these  has  taken  on
       responsibility for the appellant.

   39. For these reasons I am satisfied that the appellant has shown on the
       balance of probabilities  that  she  met  all  the  requirements  of
       paragraph 297 of the Immigration Rules at the time of  the  decision
       to  refuse  entry  clearance.  In  these  circumstances  it  is  not
       necessary to consider Article 8 ECHR in any detail (particularly  as
       no arguments were placed before me in relation to this provision  by
       either party) beyond stating that I find that the appellant has, and
       had at the time of decision, family life with her mother  and  step-
       father, Mr &  Mrs  Lebato,  and  that  refusal  of  entry  clearance
       interfered and interferes with this family life.  As  the  appellant
       met the requirements of the relevant Immigration Rules at  the  time
       of decision refusal of  entry  clearance  was  and  is  an  unlawful
       interference with this family life.

Decision

   40. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the  making  of  an
       error on a point of law.

   41. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside.

   42. The decision is re-made allowing the appeal under paragraph  297  of
       the Immigration Rules.



Fee Award

    In the light of my decision to re-make the decision in  the  appeal  by
    allowing it, I have considered whether to make a fee  award  (rule  23A
    (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure)  Rules  2005
    and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
    2007). I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee
    Awards in Immigration Appeals (December 2011). I have decided  to  make
    no fee award as one was not  requested  and  the  full  evidence  which
    showed the sole responsibility of the appellant's mother,  particularly
    in the supplementary statement of Mr Lebato, was only  put  forward  at
    the hearing before the Tribunal.

Annex A
                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS

Introduction

   43. The appellant is a citizen of the Ivory Coast born on 11th  November
       1994. In October 2012 she applied for entry clearance  to  join  her
       mother (Mrs Robe Sylvie Blandine Lebato) and step-father (Mr  Tagbeu
       Apollinaire Lebato) in the UK. The application was  refused  on  1st
       February 2013 on  the  basis  that  the  appellant  could  not  meet
       paragraph 297(1)(e) of the Immigration Rules.   Her  appeal  against
       the decision was dismissed by First-tier Tribunal Judge MD Dennis in
       a determination promulgated on the 26th March 2014.

   44. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal
       Osborne on 19th May 2014 on the basis that it was arguable that  the
       First-tier judge had erred in law in making factual errors regarding
       housing, wrongful receipt of child benefit  and  places  in  Abidjan
       which made his assessment on sole responsibility unreliable.

   45. The matter came  before  me  to  determine  whether  the  First-tier
       Tribunal had erred in law.

Submissions

   46. Mrs Gore relied upon the grounds of appeal. She submitted that Judge
       Dennis had not found  the  sponsor  credible  due  to  a  number  of
       misunderstandings and so had formed a negative opinion that she  did
       not have sole responsibility for her daughter.

   47. It was understandable, if Judge Dennis believed that the sponsor was
       wrongly claiming child benefit for a dead child, that he  would  not
       believe her evidence. In fact the on-going receipt  of  benefit  was
       for the Mr Tagbeu Lebato's child, and this could be  seen  from  the
       benefits letters (particularly one dated 3rd May  2013)  which  were
       handed to the Upper Tribunal and this had been the oral evidence  of
       the sponsors before the First-tier Tribunal. It was established that
       no one was sure whether there was documentary evidence on the  point
       before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  or  whether  there  was  just  an
       allegation of fraud by the presenting officer. In any case this  was
       clearly unfounded given the evidence in the benefits letters and  an
       unsound conclusion on the evidence before Judge Dennis  even  if  he
       was without the documentary evidence in the letters.

   48. Judge Dennis also believed that it was wrong of the sponsor  not  to
       take her child with her when she had to flee Ivory  Coast  to  claim
       asylum in neighbouring Ghana, but again  he  had  misunderstood  the
       evidence before him. The sponsor had gone on a trip, which  was  not
       intended to be a long one, to visit a relative without her  daughter
       and then a civil war had erupted that had made it impossible for her
       to return home.

   49. Judge Dennis had also come to wrong conclusions on accommodation and
       maintenance as he clearly had evidence that showed the sponsors  had
       a two bedroom flat (and not a one bedroom flat) so  ought  not  have
       said this was unclear at paragraph 18. Further by Judge Dennis's own
       maths the income available for the appellant was sufficient and  not
       insufficient (as he calculated the amount of  benefits  this  family
       would have received as �1121.59 and the sponsor's claimed income was
       a net monthly amount of �2200 and this had not been put in issue  in
       the determination), see paragraph 19  of  the  determination.  Judge
       Dennis did not appear to  take  into  account  the  appellant's  own
       written evidence to the Tribunal or that of her natural father.

   50. Judge Dennis also appeared to have mixed up day to day care and  the
       issue of sole responsibility at paragraph 21 of his determination.

   51. Ms Gore accepted that it was difficult to understand what  were  the
       findings of Judge Dennis, as the determination did not separate  the
       evidence and submissions from the findings  as  was  commonly  done.
       Ultimately it  appeared  that  a  number  of  confused  findings  on
       negative matters had negatively affected his  findings  on  the  key
       issue of the appeal. Further the failure to distinguish the evidence
       and what was found on the evidence was an error in itself due to the
       lack of clarity this created.

   52. Mr Parkinson submitted  that  Judge  Dennis  had  been  entitled  to
       conclude that the sponsor had abandoned her daughter  in  the  Ivory
       Coast when she did not return to her after  the  troubles  in  Ivory
       Coast, but instead moved with her husband to the UK as  the  sponsor
       had not explained why she had  made  no  efforts  to  do  this,  see
       paragraph 20 of the determination. He was entitled to say  that  the
       attitude of the sponsor to  the  appellant  was  not  reflective  of
       someone who had sole responsibility.  Judge  Dennis  had  also  been
       entitled to say that the address  for  the  appellant  on  the  visa
       application form and other documents for  a  similar  time  was  not
       exactly the same and draw negative conclusions from this. He had not
       made findings as such at paragraphs 17 regarding child  benefit  and
       18 regarding the accommodation but just noted evidence  so  if  they
       were not entirely accurate this did not matter. Further even if such
       conclusions were based on some misunderstandings  Judge  Dennis  had
       then gone on to look at  the  case  more  broadly.  The  finding  at
       paragraph 21 that the sponsor did not have sole  responsibility  was
       open to Judge Dennis on the evidence before him.

   53. At the end of the hearing I informed the parties that I  found  that
       Judge Dennis had erred in law in the determination of the appeal but
       that I would set out my full reasons in writing.

   54. It was submitted by Mrs Gore that it was  not  possible  to  proceed
       that day as a French interpreter had been requested by the  sponsors
       but none was available, and further she had not been  supplied  with
       the bundles which had been before the First-tier Tribunal so was not
       ready to proceed. Mr Parkinson  was  happy  for  the  matter  to  be
       adjourned for the re-making hearing. In these circumstances I agreed
       to the request that re-making hearing be adjourned.

Conclusions - Error of law

   55. The key issue in this  appeal  was  whether  the  sponsor  had  sole
       responsibility for the appellant. They key  guidance  case  on  this
       issue is TD (Paragraph  297(i)(  e):  "sole  responsibility")  Yemen
       [2006]  UKAIT  00049,  which  summarises  the  correct  approach  at
       paragraph 52. Of course there was no need for Judge Dennis  to  have
       cited TD Yemen by name but it was necessary for him  to  follow  the
       guidance set out in that case.

   56. I find that Judge Dennis erred in  law  by  failing  to  make  clear
       findings as to whether this appellant was brought up by both of  her
       parents or not; and whether those with day to day  care  had  simply
       this or whether they had also  taken  over  responsibility  for  the
       appellant  in  terms  of  making  the  important  decisions  in  the
       appellant's life.

   57. At paragraph 21 Judge Dennis sees to equate his conclusion that  the
       sponsor was happy that the appellant was being adequately cared  for
       in her absence with her  not  having  sole  responsibility  for  the
       appellant, despite noting correctly that that responsibility was not
       the same as daily care. The fact that the sponsor was happy that the
       appellant was well cared for on a day to day  basis  would  not,  of
       course, mean she did not retain sole responsibility for her.  Indeed
       the fact that she arranged adequate care would indicate the  sponsor
       was taking at least some on-going responsibility for the appellant.

   58. I also find that key matters, such as the evidence  of  remittances,
       were not dealt with adequately. In the  appellant's  bundle  are  30
       remittance receipts. It is said in conclusion at paragraph 20 of the
       determination that: "there is no indication whatsoever that any fund
       were sent for the care and maintenance for the Appellant  while  she
       was with her father." Judge Dennis  found  that  the  appellant  had
       lived with her father and grandfather for a period of two  years,  I
       understand between 2011 and 2013. There are many remittance receipts
       relating to 2012 which must therefore relate to this period. Earlier
       in the determination, at paragraph 16, Judge  Dennis  looks  at  the
       remittance evidence and concludes that they  support  the  sponsors'
       evidence that they sent �125 a month  in  2012  and  2013.  He  then
       objects to the evidence because he  says  there  is  no  explanation
       about the payee, Anselme Innocent Guero, but this is  not  accurate.
       At paragraph 6 of Mr Lebato's statement and at paragraph  8  of  Mrs
       Lebato's statement he is named as a man in the city whom  they  used
       to send funds to the appellant. He is also named as the  person  who
       was used to provide her with the funds sent by the sponsors  to  the
       Ivory Coast in the appellant's  own  letter.  It  is  therefore  not
       accurate to say that there is no indication  whatsoever  that  funds
       were sent by the sponsors from the UK to the appellant  during  this
       time; and I find that Judge  Dennis  has  failed  to  make  adequate
       findings on the evidence before him.

   59. As is clear  from  the  submissions  by  Mrs  Gore  it  is  hard  to
       understand whether ultimately a number of the  apparent  conclusions
       in the determination are findings or simply noting, with some degree
       of approval, submissions made by the respondent. An example of  this
       is the matter of whether the  sponsor  was  wrongly  claiming  child
       benefit (which it is now absolutely clear that she was not) and  the
       subsequent impact on the assessment of  the  sponsor's  credibility.
       There is a failure to separate the evidence and the submissions from
       the Judge's findings based on this  evidence.  Whilst  it  might  be
       possible to write a clear determination without sections devoted  to
       evidence, submissions and findings in this case it did not  succeed.
       For this reason too the determination fails to give adequate reasons
       for the ultimate  decision  that  the  sponsor  did  not  have  sole
       responsibility.

Decision

   60. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the  making  of  an
       error on a point of law.

   61. The decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  is  set  aside  with  no
       findings preserved.

Directions

     1. The re-making hearing is adjourned to be heard  before  me  in  the
        Upper Tribunal at my next  available  date  in  September  2014  or
        failing that the earliest date I am sitting thereafter.

     2. The appellant should produce  a  schedule  of  addresses,  for  the
        appellant from birth to present setting out by whom she  was  cared
        for at the time, which links to the documents submitted in  support
        of the appeal and explains any difference in addresses on documents
        pertaining to the same time.

    3. Any new evidence should  be  served  in  accordance  with  paragraph
       15(2A) of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.

    4. The parties should file any new evidence on which they wish to  rely
       and their skeleton arguments on the Tribunal and serve such evidence
       on the other party seven days prior to the hearing date.

    5. A French interpreter is required.

    6. The estimated length of hearing is three hours.
