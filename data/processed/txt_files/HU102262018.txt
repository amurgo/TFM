                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal against  a  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Nixon, promulgated  on  25th  October  2018,  following  a  hearing  at
    Birmingham on 9th October 2018.  In the decision, the judge allowed the
    appeal of the Appellant, whereupon the Respondent Secretary  of  State,
    subsequently applied for, and was granted, permission to appeal to  the
    Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.

The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a male, a citizen of  India,  and  was  born  on  27th
    January 1984.  He appeals against the decision of the Respondent, dated
    18th April 2018, refusing his application for leave to  remain  on  the
    basis of long  residence.   The  basis  of  the  refusal  is  that  the
    Appellant has been dishonest in relation to his tax affairs.

The Appellant's Claim

 3. The Appellant states that he has not been dishonest.   He  states  that
    there has been no discrepancy in his tax affairs.  He  has  been  self-
    employed.  All he had done was to correct a  tax  return  for  2010  to
    2011, by way of an amendment, which the refusal letter states (at  page
    7) as one where:-

         "It does not find it credible that if you were in the  presence  of
         your accountant you were not requested to review of  your  accounts
         and sign that they were an accurate  reflection  of  your  business
         income.  It is also questionable as to why you were  not  aware  of
         any errors with your 2010-2011 tax return ...".

 4. The Appellant maintains that he has never stated that his 2010 to  2011
    tax amendments were as a result of a mistake.  His amendment  was  only
    so as to enable him to avoid any complications in his  application  for
    leave to remain in this country.  All this was an irregularity that  he
    was correcting.   It was the only irregularity in all his  tax  affairs
    over an eleven year period that he had been in this country.  He was  a
    married man, married to a doctor working at  Luton,  and  had  his  own
    home.  He has two children.  He has been engaged in community projects.
     The amendment that  he  had  made  was  an  honest  amendment  to  one
    particular tax year in relation to his expenses.  That is all  it  was.
    As soon as it had been discovered by his accountant, the Appellant  had
    the option of putting it right, which he did.  There  was  a  plausible
    mistake by a previous  accountant.   Mistakes  of  this  kind  are  not
    unknown, particularly over a period of ten years.  No penalty had  been
    exacted upon him by the HMRC.  This was the only aberration in his  tax
    affairs (see paragraphs 10 to 13 of the decision).

The Judge's Findings

 5. The judge observed that the effect of  the  Appellant's  amendment  was
    that he made an extra payment of tax.   The  judge  observed  that  the
    discrepancy was in fact identified by the Appellant's accountant before
    the application and rectified by his payment of an  additional  tax  of
    ï¿½3,371.00 (paragraph 18).  No penalty was exacted  by  the  HMRC.   The
    Appellant:-

         "seemingly had no obligation to pay any additional  tax  but  could
         have simply set the error off against a future return.  I find that
         the fact that he chose to deal with the error in this way indicates
         that he was not deliberately trying to mislead.  I think it is very
         much in the Appellant's favour that he has lived in the UK for over
         a decade and submitted numerous tax returns and this  is  the  only
         error that has emerged, once again  pointing  towards  an  innocent
         mistake" (paragraph 19).

 6. The appeal was allowed.

Grounds of Application

 7. The grounds of application state that the  judge  had  failed  to  have
    regard to cases in relation to a tax misconduct such  as  those  of  ex
    parte Khan [2018] UKUT 00384, because what  that  case  emphasised  was
    that when considering whether or not  the  Appellant  is  dishonest  or
    merely careless, it is not enough to say that the Appellant relied upon
    his accountant, because it is to  the  accountant  that  the  Appellant
    gives his information, and he has the option of  then  checking  it  as
    well.  The judge had not followed the steps recommended  in  Khan  when
    assessing whether the Appellant acted dishonestly in his dealings  with
    the HMRC.  The points had not been addressed in Khan.

 8. Permission to appeal was initially refused by the First-tier  Tribunal,
    but then allowed by Judge Storey on 17th January 2019.

Submissions

 9. At the hearing before me on 19th February 2019, Mr Tarlow, appearing on
    behalf of the Respondent Secretary of State relied upon the grounds  of
    application.  He submitted that there had been a delay in the Appellant
    correcting his tax affairs.  This was the basis upon  which  the  Upper
    Tribunal had granted permission.  The incorrect tax return was for 2010
    to 2011, and on the Appellant's own account, he did nothing to  correct
    it until 2015.  This was not a matter that had been addressed by  Judge
    Nixon.

10. For his part, Mr Saini submitted that the grounds were  simply  generic
    as they often appear in such cases.  Moreover, the  reference  to  Khan
    and other cases was a  reference  to  judicial  review  cases  where  a
    different standard of proof applies.  Moreover,  the  other  cases  are
    unreported.  The fact remained that  not  a  single  paragraph  in  the
    judge's decision  had  been  expressly  challenged  by  the  Respondent
    Secretary of State.  On the other hand, Mr Saini drew my  attention  to
    an unreported Upper Tribunal decision  in  which  he  had  appeared  of
    Quadri (HU/04004/2018) which had been promulgated on 15th January 2018.
     In this decision, DUTJ Davidge had referred to  the  cases  of  Samant
    [2017] UKAIT JR/6546/2018 and to  the  case  of  Abbasi  JR/13807/2016.
    First, the evidence of  the  accountant  in  that  case  had  not  been
    contested at the hearing before the judge.  It was  evidence  that  was
    capable of providing a plausible explanation for the error on  the  tax
    return.  There may have been  unattractive  aspects  to  the  evidence.
    However, it was the case that the burden rested on the Respondent.   It
    was not for the judge to make up the Respondent's case  (see  paragraph
    4).

11. Second, cases such as Abbasi are not on all fours with a case  such  as
    the present, because in this case the HMRC had investigated and reached
    a decision that the Appellant was not culpably  careless  and  had  not
    engaged in deliberate deception.  Third, these cases are in  any  event
    judicial review cases.  In  this  case  the  issue  of  delay  was  not
    significant as a  factor  because  there  was  no  discrepancy  in  the
    Appellant's accounts.  He was simply correcting a matter that  he  need
    not have corrected because as the judge made it  clear  he  could  have
    simply set the error off against a future return  (see  paragraph  19).
    At no place was the tax return wrong.  It was not the case at all  that
    he had ever avoided any tax.  This was entirely different from what was
    said at Khan (at head note (v)).  The Appellant was entitled  to  avoid
    complications in his application by  correcting  matters  at  any  time
    before his application.

No Error of Law

12. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  did  not
    involve the making of an error on a point of law (see Section 12(1)  of
    TCEA 2007), such that  I  should  set  aside.   On  the  contrary,  the
    decision is detailed, and sensitive in its treatment of facts  on  each
    side.

13. First, it is important to understand what  the  alleged  "irregularity"
    was that the Appellant was seeking to correct for the tax year 2010  to
    2011.   The  judge  refers  to  this  as  an  attempt  "to  avoid   any
    complications" (paragraph 10).  That is indeed right.

14. The Appellant explains in great detail (at pages 3 to 5 of his  witness
    statement of 24th  September  2018)  that  the  reason  why  his  self-
    employment income declared to UKVI was different to HMRC was:-

         "because of the fact that my Self-employment income period was from
         1st April 2010 to 31st December 2010 and did not coincide  with  my
         tax period of April 2010 to April 2011, and as such I had some more
         expenses that I had included in my returns for the  year  2010-2011
         to HMRC" (paragraph 18).

15. This clearly demonstrates how a desire  to  "avoid  any  complications"
    would have arisen.  The plain fact was that the  tax  year  from  April
    2010 to April 2011 did not tally  with  the  Appellant's  self-employed
    income period which was declared from 1st April 2010 to  31st  December
    2010.  The Appellant goes on to explain that Mr Samard  Khan,  enquired
    of him if he was able to gather the old  invoices  because  the  chance
    remained that the Home Office may want to question him about his income
    discrepancy "and that I should be able to justify it".




16. The Appellant explains that he was unable to find any old  invoices  or
    transactions  "pertaining  to  2010/2011"  (see  paragraph  19).    The
    Appellant goes on to explain that:-

         "Mr Samard Khan presented to me the option of carrying  out  a  tax
         correction for year 2010-11, which will result in me having to  pay
         more taxes to HMRC but at the same time  will  result  in  my  Home
         Office and HMRC income matching.  And at the time this seemed to me
         the only option out in case the issue was  highlighted"  (paragraph
         20).

17. Second, against this background, it does rather seem that the Appellant
    was being penalised by the Home Office for  actually  setting  straight
    his financial affairs, in a way that would leave  absolutely  no  doubt
    about his probity in the way in which he had  conducted  himself.   The
    judge herself was able to recognise  the  efforts  that  the  Appellant
    made.




18. Indeed, the Home Office Presenting Officer on the day of  the  Tribunal
    hearing also "conceded that his tax irregularities were a one  off  and
    from some years ago but submitted that it  was  his  responsibility  to
    check his financial affairs" (paragraph 16).

19.  Third,  this  was  a  case  where  the  Appellant  had  actually  been
    interviewed.  Yet, the interview record was not  available  before  the
    Tribunal.  The judge expressed concern that "I am unable  to  read  the
    questions and answers in context" and that from what she had  seen  she
    did not find it "questionable" that a man who is starting  out  in  his
    own business is prepared to work full-time in a retail unit.  In  fact,
    the judge went on to say that, "Indeed  I  commend  the  Appellant  for
    working  in  order  to   support   his   family   notwithstanding   his
    qualifications".

20. Moreover, the judge found that the information before the Tribunal  was
    "sparse information provided to me in the refusal letter" and  that  it
    was not the case at all, as the Home Office  had  concluded,  that  the
    Appellant had "been vague and given little detail about his  business".
    The judge's eventual conclusion is unambiguously clear,  namely,  that,
    "I am able to understand his business from his answers and struggle  to
    see what more detail the Respondent would require" (paragraph 20).  All-
    in-all, accordingly, there is no error of law and the decision  of  the
    judge shall stand.

Notice of Decision

21. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the  making  of
    an error on a point of law.  The decision shall stand.

22. This appeal by the Respondent Home Office is dismissed.

23. No anonymity direction is made.
