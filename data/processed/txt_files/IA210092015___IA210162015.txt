                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

1.   The first appellant, RB, appeals to the Upper Tribunal with  permission
    from Upper Tribunal Judge Pitt on 30 March 2017.  When  she  considered
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal, Judge Pitt thought that  there
    may have been a material error of law in relation to the assessment  of
    the medical evidence.  The First-tier Tribunal had  heard  evidence  in
    relation to the condition of the second appellant, J R, who very  sadly
    suffered from a  form  of  lymphoma  which  required  chemotherapy  and
    subsequent ongoing treatment.  Judge Pitt thought that it may have been
    at least arguable that it was a "compelling case" acknowledging  though
    that in medical cases, even those involving children, there was a  very
    high threshold for appellants to surmount before they would be able  to
    show that Article 3 of the European Convention on Human  Rights  (ECHR)
    would be engaged.

2.   The first appellant's immigration history  is  as  follows.  She  first
    came to the UK as a visitor in 2002.  She had various forms  of  leave,
    including as a student until 2009, but she has since remained in the UK
    unlawfully without  having  applied  to  regularise  her  status  until
    recently.  Indeed, I was told that she had been here for  up  to  eight
    years before any attempt to regularise her  status  was  made.   During
    that time, she had given birth to  the  second  appellant,  J  R.  That
    application was refused on 19 May 2015.  The  appellant  appealed  that
    refusal to the First-tier Tribunal.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  decided
    that the refusal of leave to remain  was  justified.  Accordingly,  the
    appeal was dismissed, both under Articles  3  and  8  of  the  European
    Convention on  Human  Rights.   There  was  no  application  under  the
    Immigration Rules for them to stay.

3.   Submissions were made by both representatives to  the  Upper  Tribunal.
    Mr Bobb, on behalf of the appellants, maintained that the appeal  ought
    to have succeeded under Article 3 or Article 8 of the  ECHR.   He  said
    there was evidence before the Tribunal that the child appellant,  J  R,
    would develop adverse side-effects if he did not receive proper follow-
    up treatment.  He referred me to page 25 of  the  bundle  of  documents
    before the First-tier Tribunal which was a letter from  the  Department
    of Haematology  and  Oncology  at  Great  Ormond  Street  Hospital  for
    Children which indicated that if James did  not  receive  the  relevant
    five yearly ECGs to detect any adverse consequences, he remained  at  a
    moderate risk of long-term "cardiomyopathy".  Mr Bobb pointed out  that
    although the Immigration  Judge  had  dealt  with  this  issue  in  his
    decision he had linked it to the economic circumstances  of  the  first
    appellant.  Specifically, he had suggested  that  the  first  appellant
    could find the sums of money that would be  required  to  pay  for  the
    ongoing treatment for her child and he made findings about the cost  of
    that treatment in Jamaica.  He said that it  would  cost  approximately
    �4,765 to �13,700.  Unfortunately, the first appellant  does  not  work
    now, although she has worked in the  UK  in  the  past,  legally,  and,
    according to Mr Bobb, paid her  taxes.   He  says  there  would  be  no
    realistic expectation that she would be  able  to  save  such  sums  of
    money, which are very substantial sums by the standards of Jamaica, and
    he says that the reality of the situation was that this would represent
    a real risk to the health and welfare of this  young  child.   Mr  Bobb
    realistically and quite properly accepted that  medical  treatment  was
    available within Jamaica, but he did say that it could not be  divorced
    from its practical situation, which is that in fact the first appellant
    would not be in the position to afford such treatment.  He referred  me
    to the case of GS [2015] EWCA Civ  40.  Having  pointed  out  that  the
    gravity of what  would  befall  the  second  appellant,  James,  if  he
    returned to Jamaica, he said that the UK should be held responsible for
    the potentially grave consequences that might befall him.  It  mattered
    not,  he  said,  that  the  first  appellant  was  here,   effectively,
    overstaying unlawfully.  He said  that  although  he  acknowledged  the
    threshold for Article 3 was a high one, as indeed did  Judge  Pitt,  he
    said it would be inhumane not  to  permit  the  family,  that  is  both
    appellants, to remain in the UK for the child appellant to continue  to
    receive treatment, presumably under the National  Health  Service.   Mr
    Bobb went on to deal with Article 8 and said that although  he  accepts
    that a balancing exercise was necessary and that the Immigration  Judge
    had referred to many of the balancing factors, this was  a  case  which
    crossed that threshold. Indeed, the moral and physical integrity of the
    second appellant was threatened by his return to Jamaica.   That  being
    so, he said the Immigration Judge had not adequately grappled with  the
    wider context in which the appeal had to be decided.  It was not simply
    a case of considering the fact that the second  appellant's  life  with
    his mother could continue in Jamaica, it was necessary to look  at  the
    wider context in which the case had to be decided,  and  in  particular
    the ongoing need for medical treatment. This,  he  said  was  a  highly
    relevant factor in this case.  He also  referred  to  the  case  of  EV
    (Philippines) and other recent case law and stated that  in  conclusion
    it was a case where the Immigration  Judge  had  reached  a  reasonable
    conclusion.

4.   In response Mr Armstrong on behalf of the  respondent  referred  me  to
    the specific findings in relation to the medical evidence, for  example
    at paragraphs  18  to  23  of  the  decision,  pointing  out  that  the
    Immigration Judge had indeed grappled with the medical evidence in some
    detail, had made appropriate findings which were open to  him  on  that
    evidence, including findings in relation to the cost of such  treatment
    in Jamaica.  He said that the leading case under article 3 remained N v
    The Secretary of State [2005] 2 A C 296, which is referred  to  in  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal. That reached all the levels of the
    appellate process, including the House of Lords and the European  Court
    of Human Rights, reported at [2008] 25 BHRC 258.  He said that in those
    cases the applicant had a medical condition, which provided the  reason
    for seeking Article 3 protection in  the  UK.  It  was  held  that  the
    Secretary of State was not required to address the economic disparities
    between different systems of healthcare across the world.  I  suggested
    in argument that James was fortunate to have been  given  treatment  by
    one  of  the  most  noted  hospitals  for  this  type   of   treatment.
    Unfortunately,  access  to  such  facilities  is  limited  by  economic
    resources.  Mr Armstrong invited me to  conclude  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal had reached a decision that was open to  it  on  the  evidence
    having regard to the fact that the first appellant had been in  the  UK
    without leave  for  some  considerable  time  before  regularising  her
    position there were strong balancing  factors  under  Article  8  which
    tipped the balance in favour of the respondent. The Tribunal below  had
    applied the correct  test  under  Article  8  and  reached  the  proper
    conclusions that were open to it. He also said the case did  not  cross
    the threshold for engaging Article 3 rights.

5.   Mr Bobb briefly responded to say  that  he  did  not  accept  that  the
    health service in Jamaica was sufficiently robust, and certainly not as
    robust as the Secretary  of  State  had  portrayed  it  as  being.  The
    economic disparity between the UK and Jamaica was a relevant factor  to
    consider.  He accepted that his client had been in the UK illegally for
    some time but he did not accept that she had never contributed  to  the
    UK economy.  Indeed, he pointed out that she had in fact paid taxes for
    a significant period before subsequently remaining here illegally.

Reasons for my Decision

6.   I should begin by saying that cases  involving  the  need  for  ongoing
    medical treatment, especially where they concern the health of a  young
    child, are some of the most difficult that this Tribunal  has  to  deal
    with. If I may say so, it is accepted that the first appellant has  had
    her son's best interests  at  heart  at  all  stages.  Anybody  in  her
    position would have taken the steps which she  has  taken  to  try  and
    ensure that she can remain in  the  UK  to  ensure  the  best  possible
    treatment for her son, as well, no doubt, as securing the best economic
    circumstances for her family. However, as Judge Pitt acknowledged,  the
    threshold in relation to Article 3, is a  high  one,  even  in  a  case
    involving a child. The case had to  be  a  compelling  one  before  the
    appeal could be allowed on that basis.

7.   In this case, as the Immigration Judge acknowledged, and  I  understand
    both sides accepted, by the date of  the  hearing  James  had  received
    appropriate medical treatment,  and  indeed  was  effectively  free  of
    debilitating illness. His medical history, treatment and prognosis were
    fully considered by the First-tier  Tribunal.  The  Immigration  Judges
    decision dealt fully with the need for ongoing treatment in the form of
    ECG analysis on a periodic basis.  The Immigration Judge  pointed  out,
    at paragraph 68, that James had been most likely to have been cured and
    that the critical period was one day from the end of treatment and that
    on 23 August that he had survived for 23 months following  the  end  of
    his cause of treatment.  The significance of that was that the  hearing
    took place in early September 2016 shortly after that 23-month  period.
    Mr Bobb has criticised the Immigration Judge for not engaging with  the
    medical evidence, but I find that the Immigration Judge  fully  engaged
    with that evidence to the  extent  necessary  and  reached  appropriate
    conclusions. In particular, I would draw  attention  to  paragraphs  62
    onwards, where he deals  specifically  with  medical  evidence  in  the
    context of Article 3 of the ECHR.

8.   It was also suggested the Immigration Judge had not fully engaged  with
    Article 8 and the moral and physical integrity requirements of  Article
    8(1), as defined by the case law including the leading case of  Razgar.
    The criticisms of the Immigration Judge's decision in relation  to  the
    moral and physical integrity aspects Article  8  were  less  pronounced
    than those under  Article  3.  The  Immigration  Judge  considered  the
    balancing exercise undertaken by the  Secretary  of  State  fully.  The
    public interest considerations, set out by Parliament  in  the  section
    117 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002,  include  the
    need for persons who seek  to  remain  in  the  UK  to  be  financially
    independent and not a burden on taxpayers. Furthermore,  respondent  is
    required to pursue a policy of balanced immigration in accordance  with
    the economic interests of the UK. Unfortunately,  the  first  appellant
    was in the UK without any form of leave for a long period of  time  and
    has taken advantage of public services during that time.  There  appear
    to have been strong grounds under Article 8 (2) of the  E  C  H  R  for
    refusing the appellant's application for leave to remain in this case.

Decision

9.   I  have  concluded  that  the  Immigration  Judge  reached  appropriate
    conclusions, in relation to both the Articles of the ECHR relied  upon.
    Those conclusions were based on the evidence placed before him. He  was
    entitled to come to the decision he came to and I can find no  material
    error of law in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

10.  Accordingly, the appeal to the Upper Tribunal is dismissed.


Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

The First-tier Tribunal made an anonymity  direction  and  I  continue  that
direction. In particular, I direct that  unless  and  until  a  tribunal  or
court directs otherwise, the Appellants be granted anonymity. No  report  of
these proceedings shall directly or indirectly identify then or  any  member
of their family. This direction applies  both  to  the  appellants  and  the
respondent. Failure to comply with this direction could lead to contempt  of
court proceedings.
