For the Appellant:     The Sponsor Mrs Ahmed and her daughter Miss Ahmed
For the Respondent:    Mr N Bramble, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. In a decision and error of law and directions issued on  4  March  2019
    the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge L K Gibbs was  set  aside  by
    the Upper Tribunal.  That decision is appended to this  decision.   The
    appellant, a citizen of Bangladesh born on 3 May 1949 had  appealed  to
    the First-tier Tribunal against the  decision  of  an  Entry  Clearance
    Officer, dated 12 March 2018, to refuse the appellant  entry  clearance
    as a spouse.

Re-Making the Decision

 2. In compliance with  my  directions  the  appellant's  sponsor  and  his
    daughter had produced an index bundle of documents  including  but  not
    limited to witness statements for both the sponsor,  Mrs  Selina  Ahmed
    and her daughter Miss Tajbee Ahmed.

 3. The evidence confirmed that the appellant and the  sponsor  married  in
    November 1974 in Bangladesh  when  the  appellant  had  worked  at  the
    Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Bangladesh.  In July 1986 the  appellant
    was posted to the  Bangladesh  High  Commission  in  London  where  the
    appellant and sponsor moved with  their  two  children.   In  1994  the
    appellant was transferred back to Bangladesh but the  sponsor  remained
    in the  UK  with  their  children  so  that  they  could  finish  their
    education, the children and the  sponsor  spending  their  holidays  in
    Bangladesh and the appellant visiting the UK.  In 1998,  the  appellant
    took a post at the Bangladesh Embassy in Moscow  which  permitted  more
    regular visits.  In 2002 the appellant took early retirement  and  came
    to the UK and was granted indefinite leave to remain on  23  July  2003
    and a copy of that letter was included in the bundle of documents.

 4. In 2004 the appellant returned to Bangladesh to start construction of a
    five storey building in Dhaka to become the family's base in Dhaka (the
    appellant's daughter in evidence described it as  their  holiday  home)
    together with apartments they could rent out.  Various  family  members
    spent time in Bangladesh over the next few years and the  sponsor  made
    long visits to Bangladesh and during 2011/2012 both the sponsor and her
    adult children spent six months in Bangladesh to spend time with  their
    husband/father.  This was also the case in 2013.  Due to the fact  that
    the family were spending  long  periods  of  time  in  Bangladesh,  the
    appellant did not need to visit the UK  and  his  indefinite  leave  to
    remain lapsed as he had been out of the country for over two years.  It
    was the family's evidence that as the appellant had never been  refused
    a visa to the UK he did not think that letting the indefinite leave  to
    remain lapse would have a significant impact.

 5. However this has not been the  case  and  although  the  appellant  has
    applied for visit visas on  a  number  of  occasions  these  have  been
    refused on the grounds that he would remain in the UK whereas  when  he
    applied for a settlement visa he was refused on  the  grounds  that  he
    would not settle.  It is the family's case that they would now like  to
    spend the majority of their time in  the  UK  with  regular  visits  to
    Bangladesh.  It was the  sponsor's  consistent  case  that  she  has  a
    flexible employment arrangement that allows her to take long periods of
    leave so that she can spend periods of  time  in  Bangladesh  with  her
    husband.  This evidence was supported by Miss Tajbee Ahmed.

 6. Mr Bramble, at the beginning  of  the  hearing  on  the  basis  of  the
    evidence now  before  the  Tribunal,  conceded  that  the  relationship
    requirements of Appendix FM under the Immigration Rules  were  met.   I
    share that conclusion as it was patently obvious, even  before  hearing
    oral evidence that the appellant and the sponsor are  in  a  subsisting
    marriage  and  intend  to  live  together  permanently.   Although  the
    appellant may have submitted less evidence  than  was  optimal  to  the
    Entry Clearance Officer when  the  application  was  first  made  I  am
    satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the relationship between
    the appellant and sponsor  is  genuine  and  subsisting  and  that  the
    appellant and the sponsor intend to live together  permanently  in  the
    UK, notwithstanding they will continue to holiday in Bangladesh.  I  am
    satisfied that such holidays would not breach the  requirements  of  E-
    ECP.2.10.

 7.  Although  Mr  Lindsay  had  conceded  that  the  specified   financial
    information had been submitted including of at least  six  months  bank
    statements, it was Mr Bramble's submission that unfortunately,  due  to
    the nature of the sponsor's employment including that she  had  regular
    breaks to spend time in Bangladesh with  her  husband,  she  could  not
    substantively meet the financial requirements of the Immigration  Rules
    at the date of application (as required under Appendix FM).

 8. That must be the case.  I do not share the conclusion of  the  previous
    Immigration Judge in relation to the sponsor's employment.  Although it
    is described by the employer as  "casual"  I  accept,  and  Mr  Bramble
    agreed, that what was  meant  by  the  letter  from  the  Richmond  and
    Wandsworth Councils is that the sponsor's employment is  "flexible"  to
    allow her to spend time with her husband with extended periods of leave
    where she does not get paid.  However I accept, as did Mr Bramble, that
    when she is in the UK and if she were to work twelve months employment,
    her annual salary is �24,571  per  annum.   However,  at  the  date  of
    decision the payslips provided by the appellant for  the  sponsor  show
    that her income at that time fell below the �18,600 per  annum  because
    of the time spent in Bangladesh.

 9. The appellant made his application for entry clearance  on  7  December
    2017 and at that date the payslips for 2017 showed that the taxable pay
    as of 15 November 2017 was �10,684.03.   The  subsequent  payslips  for
    March 2018 shows that the total pay to date in the tax  year  was  just
    �12,497.  Although therefore I accept that the sponsor  would  normally
    earn well in excess of the specified gross annual income she had not at
    the relevant date for the appellant's application.   In  addition,  and
    such was not disputed by the sponsors,  although  the  bank  statements
    showed some savings these did not reach the required level as  set  out
    in Appendix FM of specified savings.

10. Therefore I have  to  conclude  that  the  appellant  cannot  meet  the
    requirements of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules as he did not,  at
    the relevant date, meet the financial requirements.

11. I factor that finding, that the appellant does not meet the Immigration
    Rules, into my conclusions in considering the only  appeal  before  the
    Tribunal which is a human rights appeal.  It  is  not  disputed  by  Mr
    Bramble and I accept and find that the appellant and the sponsor  enjoy
    family life.  It was Mr Bramble's submission that there was  no  family
    life in relation to the adult children.  Although  the  adult  children
    continue to live with their mother it was Mr Bramble's submission  that
    this in  itself  does  not  demonstrate  ties  that  go  beyond  normal
    emotional ties between adult children and their parents.

12. I accept however, that this family are particularly  close  and  in  my
    findings inter-dependent; there is some financial contribution from the
    adult children (and it was not disputed that the son of  the  appellant
    and the sponsor is married but still living with the  sponsor  and  the
    sponsor's daughter in the UK).  I am prepared to find that,  given  the
    closeness and interdependency including some  financial  dependency  of
    the sponsor on her adult  children  and  their  continued  cohabitation
    notwithstanding their age which goes beyond normal family ties,  family
    life exists with the sponsor and her adult children.  However I am  not
    satisfied that that takes the appellant's case any further.

13. I find, as Mr Bramble  accepted,  that  the  entry  clearance  decision
    interferes with that joint family life.  The decision is a  lawful  one
    and for the legitimate  purposes  of  the  maintenance  of  immigration
    control.  I therefore go on to consider  whether  such  a  decision  is
    proportionate.   In  so  doing  I  must  take  into  consideration  the
    requirements of Section 117 of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum
    Act 2002 Act and I have reminded myself that maintenance of immigration
    control is in the public interest and that the appellant did  not  meet
    the requirements of the Immigration Rules.  I remind  myself  what  was
    said by the Supreme Court in R (on the application of  MM  Lebanon  and
    Others) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2017]  UKSC  that
    the legitimate aim of the respondent in maintaining immigration control
    justifies the interference with  Article  8  rights  that  the  minimum
    income requirement implies.

14. Mr Bramble accepted that there was no other public interest other  than
    immigration control and it was Mr Bramble's submission, which I accept,
    that the fact that the appellant had  made  a  number  of  applications
    including both as a visitor and a spouse supported the  genuineness  of
    his case rather than the opposite in relation to the subsisting  nature
    of the relationship.

15. Although the sponsor  and  her  daughter  gave  candid  and  consistent
    evidence that  the  sponsor  does  not  wish  to  move  permanently  to
    Bangladesh because of her adult children here and because of  her  job,
    that cannot amount to compelling or exceptional circumstances such that
    leave should be granted outside of the Immigration Rules (see including
    R (on the application of Agyarko v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department) [2017] UKSC 11).  It has been the choice of this family  to
    relocate in the way that they have including  that  the  appellant  has
    until now based himself in Bangladesh  in  recent  years  in  order  to
    construct the family's holiday house/investment in Bangladesh.

16. The sponsor and her daughter were straightforward and honest  in  their
    evidence that there were no health conditions  and  although  I  accept
    that the appellant may  well  be  somewhat  depressed  because  of  his
    current inability to make a successful application to join his  family,
    there was nothing before me that might warrant a finding of  compelling
    circumstances.  In my findings therefore the decision of the respondent
    to  refuse  the  appellant's  application  is  proportionate   to   the
    legitimate aim pursued and the  appellant's  Article  8  appeal  cannot
    succeed.

17. However the helpful evidence  submitted  on  behalf  of  the  appellant
    indicates that the sponsor currently,  in  her  employment  this  year,
    although she has not quite reached the level of �18,600 her total gross
    pay to date as at 15 February  2019  was  �17,158.64.   As  Mr  Bramble
    submitted, if she has continued in this employment in March 2019 it  is
    very likely that she will have exceeded the �18,600 and therefore would
    be  in  a  position  to  assist  the  appellant  in  making  a  further
    application where the financial requirements are met.

18. The findings of the Upper Tribunal, including that I am satisfied  that
    this relationship is clearly genuine and subsisting and that the couple
    intend to live permanently together in the UK and that  in  a  "normal"
    year where the sponsor does not take a break from  her  employment  her
    income  exceeds  �24,000,  may  assist  the  appellant  in  any  future
    application he seeks to make.   Although  entirely  a  matter  for  the
    appellant, as discussed at  the  hearing,  it  may  well  be  that  the
    appellant and the sponsor  might  benefit  from  expert  assistance  in
    compiling and submitting any further application that they may wish  to
    make.

19. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains an error of law and is
    set aside.  I remake that decision dismissing the appellant's appeal.

No anonymity direction was sought or is made.

For the Appellant:     The sponsor Mrs Ahmed and her daughter Ms Ahmed
For the Respondent:    Mr T Lindsay, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                   DECISION ON ERROR OF LAW AND DIRECTIONS


 1. The appellant is a citizen  of  Bangladesh  born  on  3  May  1949  who
    appealed to the First-tier Tribunal against the decision of  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer, dated 12 March 2018, to refuse the  appellant  entry
    clearance as a spouse.  In her decision, considered on the  papers  and
    promulgated on 27 November 2018, Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  L  K
    Gibbs dismissed the appellant's appeal on all grounds.

 2. The appellant, who continues to be  unrepresented  other  than  by  the
    sponsor and by his daughter, appealed to  the  Upper  Tribunal  on  the
    grounds that the judge has stated that the  documentary  evidence  only
    covered three months whereas the appellant had provided  eight  months'
    payslips and ten months'  bank  statements  and  that  other  evidence,
    including photographic evidence and copy passports  showing  visits  to
    Bangladesh, had been provided as well as a joint mortgage statement and
    evidence that the couple had two children together.  The  grounds  also
    argued that the decision was "very unfair".

Error of Law Discussion

 3. Although the respondent Presenting Officer  did  not  have  either  the
    respondent's file or the documents which  had  been  submitted  by  the
    sponsor in compliance with  directions,  following  provision  of  this
    information by the Upper Tribunal, Mr Lindsay indicated that he was  in
    a position to proceed with the error of law hearing.

 4. Mr Lindsay conceded that from the information which had been  submitted
    in the appeal it would appear that at least six months' bank statements
    had been submitted and he was prepared to accept  that  the  judge  had
    made an error on this.

 5. Although it was  initially  mistakenly  assumed  that  Mr  Lindsay  was
    therefore conceding the appeal, Mr Lindsay subsequently submitted  that
    the real issue was set out at [9] of the decision and reasons as to the
    relationship between the appellant and  the  sponsor,  the  appellant's
    application having been refused  on  both  financial  and  relationship
    grounds.  The judge took into consideration that there was no narrative
    and it was Mr  Lindsay's  submission  that  this  narrative  was  still
    missing and therefore even with copy passports, which  Mr  Lindsay  did
    not dispute had been  submitted  on  appeal,  although  not  apparently
    considered by the judge, it was his submission that this would not have
    made a difference to the final decision.

 6. I do not agree.  This was a matter that  had  already  been  raised  in
    correspondence by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  with  the  respondent  in
    relation to missing documents.  Despite this  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    proceeded to reach a decision on the limited documents  before  it  and
    specifically cited limitations  in  the  documentation  (when  in  fact
    additional documentation had been submitted on  appeal  which  was  not
    before the First-tier Tribunal).  That was, in  my  view,  procedurally
    unfair.

 7. I considered Mr Lindsay's arguments, that the outcome  would  not  have
    been different given the  paucity  of  evidence  on  the  relationship.
    However, it cannot be said, with certainty, that the  judge's  decision
    would have necessarily been the  same,  including  in  respect  of  the
    appellant's relationship with his wife, had the  judge  considered  all
    the documents that  were  submitted  by  the  appellant,  including  on
    appeal.

 8. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains an error of law and is
    set aside. Although I was minded to remake the decision at the  hearing
    before me, Mr Lindsay was  concerned,  including  in  relation  to  the
    manner in which the documents had been produced and due to the lack  of
    any evidence from the Entry Clearance Officer, that he  was  not  in  a
    position to proceed.

Notice of Decision on Error of Law


 9. The First-tier  Tribunal's  determination  contains  an  error  of  law
    capable of affecting the outcome of the appeal and is set  aside.   The
    decision on the appeal will be remade by the Upper Tribunal.


                               Directions

1.    The  Tribunal  would  benefit  from  a  paginated  indexed  bundle  of
    documents on behalf of the appellant, to be  simultaneously  served  on
    the respondent, to be received no later than 14 days from the  date  of
    this decision.  Such bundle  to  include  all  the  evidence  that  the
    appellant and the sponsor wish to rely on to  support  the  appellant's
    claim that he meets both the financial and relationship requirements of
    the relevant Immigration Rules (and the sponsors  indicated  that  they
    would consider obtaining legal representation prior to  the  reconvened
    hearing).  The bundle is  to  separately  tabulate:  (i)  the  evidence
    relied upon before the First-tier Tribunal; and,  (ii)  the  additional
    evidence that it is now sought to rely upon before the Upper  Tribunal.



2.   It is anticipated that such evidence would include  witness  statements
    (for the sponsor and the sponsor's children  together  with  a  witness
    statement for the appellant) which should address the issues in dispute
    and referencing any documentary evidence relied  on  in  particular  to
    support the appellant's claimed relationship, as well  as  the  claimed
    meeting of the financial provisions.

3.   The respondent is to file and serve a  full  copy  of  the  ECO  bundle
    within seven days of this decision.  The respondent is also  to  serve,
    seven days prior to the resumed hearing, any further evidence relied on
    in reply to the appellant's bundle.

No anonymity direction was sought or is made.
