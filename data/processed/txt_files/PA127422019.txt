For the Appellant:     Ms A Imamovic instructed by Wright Justice
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr A Tan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 (SI 2008/2698) I  make  an  anonymity  order.   Unless  the  Upper
    Tribunal or court directs otherwise, no  report  of  these  proceedings
    shall directly or indirectly identify the  appellant.   This  direction
    applies to both the appellant and to the respondent and  a  failure  to
    comply with this direction could lead to Contempt of Court proceedings.

Introduction

 2. The appellant is a citizen of India who was born on 3 February 1981.

 3. The appellant first entered the United Kingdom in December  2009  as  a
    student with leave valid  until  30  November  2011.   That  leave  was
    subsequently extended to  30  July  2012.   Thereafter,  the  appellant
    remained in the UK as an overstayer.

 4. On 12 May 2015, the appellant, having  travelled  to  Ireland,  claimed
    asylum in Ireland.  However, he did  not  remain  in  Ireland  for  any
    decision and returned to the UK.

 5. On 19 June 2016, the appellant  entered  the  United  Kingdom.   On  15
    August 2017, he was encountered by immigration officials and  detained.
    On 19 August 2017, the appellant claimed  asylum.   The  basis  of  his
    claim was, and is, that he feared a committee in his temple (Gurdwara),
    where he had declined to take over his  father's  role,  following  the
    latter's death, as secretary/cashier.  He claimed that a fake  FIR  had
    been lodged against him and that he had been physically assaulted on  a
    number of occasions.

 6. On 12 November 2019, the Secretary of  State  refused  the  appellant's
    claims for asylum, humanitarian protection and under the ECHR.

The Appeal to the First-tier Tribunal

 7. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.  In a decision  sent
    on 24 September 2020, Judge Barker dismissed the appellant's appeal  on
    all grounds.  First, the judge made an adverse credibility finding  and
    did not accept that the appellant would be at risk, on the  basis  that
    he claimed, from the committee members of the Gurdwara.  Secondly,  the
    judge rejected the appellant's claim under Art 3 of the ECHR that there
    was a real risk, due to his  mental  health  problems,  that  he  would
    commit suicide on return to India.  Thirdly,  the  judge  rejected  the
    appellant's claim under para 276ADE(1)(vi) of the Immigration Rules (HC
    395 as amended) and outside the Rules under Art 8 of the ECHR.

The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

 8. The appellant sought permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  on  a
    number of detailed grounds.

 9. First, it was contended that in dismissing the appellant's appeal under
    Art 3 of the ECHR the judge had failed to take into account an  updated
    addendum psychiatric report from Dr Nabavi  dated  5  April  2020.   In
    addition, the judge had wrongly given only limited or diminished weight
    to letters from the appellant's GP on the basis that these letters  did
    not comply with the Practice Direction on expert evidence.  As  regards
    Art 3,  the  grounds  contend  that  the  evidence  before  the  judge,
    including the addendum report and GP letters, established a prima facie
    case under Art 3 and the onus was upon  the  respondent  to  show  that
    treatment for the appellant's mental health was available ("Ground 1").



10. Secondly, the grounds contend that the  judge  erred  in  reaching  her
    adverse credibility finding, in  particular  in  identifying  (wrongly)
    inconsistencies in the appellant's evidence, finding without supporting
    background evidence that documentation relied upon, including an arrest
    warrant, was not reliable and that the description of  the  appellant's
    offences under the Indian Penal Code were inconsistent with  his  claim
    ("Ground 2").

11. Thirdly, the judge had erred in  assessing  whether  there  were  "very
    significant  obstacles"  to  the  appellant's  integration  under  para
    276ADE(1)(vi) and in assessing his claim outside the Rules under Art  8
    ("Ground 3").

12. On 23 October 2020, the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Nightingale) granted
    the appellant permission to appeal.

13. Subsequently, the appellant filed further submissions in support of the
    appeal dated 21 December 2020 and the Secretary of State filed  written
    submissions in response to the appellant's grounds of  appeal  dated  6
    January 2021.

14. On 22 December 2020, the  appellant's  legal  representatives  made  an
    application  under  rule  15(2A)  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure   (Upper
    Tribunal) Rules 2008 to admit further evidence relating to  the  ground
    of appeal which contends that the judge erred in law by not considering
    the addendum report from Dr Nabavi.  I  have  admitted  that  evidence,
    relevant to  the  error  of  law  issue,  without  objection  from  the
    respondent.

15. The appeal was listed for a remote hearing on  10  June  2021.   I  was
    based in the Cardiff Civil Justice Centre and Ms Imamovic  and  Mr  Tan
    joined the hearing by Microsoft Teams.

16. In addition to relying upon their earlier written submissions, I  heard
    oral submissions from both representatives.

Discussion

17. I will consider each of the grounds relied upon by Ms Imamovic and both
    representatives' submissions in relation to those grounds in turn.

    Ground 1

18. The appellant claimed that on return to India he was at  real  risk  of
    committing suicide as a result  of  his  mental  health  problems  and,
    applying the test in AM (Zimbabwe) v SSHD  [2020]  UKSC  17  (at  [27]-
    [31]), his return would breach Art 3 of the ECHR.

19. In order to support  that  claim,  the  appellant  relied  upon  expert
    evidence from a  consultant  psychiatrist,  Dr  Behrouz  Nabavi.   That
    evidence was set out in a report dated 24 July 2020.  In addition,  and
    this is now accepted by Mr Tan on behalf  of  the  Secretary  of  State
    based upon the evidence filed with the rule 15(2A) application from the
    appellant's legal representatives, an addendum  report  dated  6  April
    2020 was sent to both the First-tier Tribunal and the respondent on  28
    July 2020 in advance of the hearing.  Again, based  upon  the  evidence
    now filed, it is clear that neither the  First-tier  Tribunal  nor  the
    respondent has any record of having received that addendum report.

20. In the result, Judge Barker made no reference to that  addendum  report
    referring only to the original report of Dr  Nabavi.   The  judge  made
    specific reference to that report at paras 115 and 116 of her decision.
     She said this:

         "115.    The appellant relies  on  a  psychiatric  report  from  Dr
             Behrouz  Nabavi,  dated  8th   March  2018  and  based  on  an
             assessment of the appellant on  5th  March  2018  (AB  32-59).
             This is two and a � years old now, and whilst it  details  the
             appellant's mental health  condition  thoroughly  and  reports
             that  the  appellant  fulfils  the  diagnostic  criteria   for
             recurrent  depressive  disorder,  it  is  very  old,  in  fact
             concludes that with  engagement  with  professionals  and  the
             recommended psychological interventions, Dr Nabavi anticipates
             an overall noticeable recovery to be measured in the order  of
             two years.  As I have indicated it is over two years now since
             this report was written.

         116. Dr Nabavi was unable to reference any earlier medical  records
             of the appellant, and the appellant confirmed to  him,  as  he
             did to me in evidence, that he has not registered with a GP in
             the United Kingdom since his return from Ireland in 2016".

    Then, at para 117 the judge noted:

         "It is  clear  that  the  only  medical  evidence  I  have  of  the
         appellant's health, is that relating to his  condition  only  since
         2018".

21. The  judge then referred to letters from the appellant's  GP  dated  25
    April 2019 and February 2020.  I will return to these  later  and  that
    that evidence was entitled to diminished weight because  it  failed  to
    comply with the Practice Direction relating to expert evidence.

22. At paras 128-129, the judge said this:

         "128.    However, bearing in mind  the  standard  of  proof,  I  do
             accept that the appellant  was  diagnosed  with  a  depressive
             disorder in 2018 and has since completed a course  of  therapy
             to help him manage his depression, and has now been discharged
             from the mental health service,  and  was  in  February  2020,
             prescribed Sertraline, and anti-depressant  medication,  which
             he has been prescribed since about March 2018.

         129. I do not find though that the appellant is currently  at  risk
             of suicide, and  find  that  the  evidence  submitted  by  the
             appellant,  demonstrates  his  condition  is   stabilised   on
             medication and the conclusion of Dr Nabavi that he anticipated
             an overall noticeable recovery to be measured in the order  of
             two  years,  has  been  borne  out  given  the  treatment  and
             assistance the appellant has received in that time".

23. At para 132 the judge said this:

         "132.    In the appellant's case, given my  findings  above,  I  am
             satisfied  that  he  suffers  from  depression  for  which  he
             currently receives medication.  I have seen no  evidence  that
             he requires any other treatment, and  no  evidence  about  the
             effect on an inability to access such treatment.  However,  it
             seems to follow that without  the  prescribed  medication  the
             state  of  the  appellant's  mental  health  would   diminish,
             although whether there is  a  real  risk  of  suicide  is  not
             clear".

24. At paras 133-135, the  judge,  applying  the  test  in  AM  (Zimbabwe),
    concluded that it had not  been  established  that  there  would  be  a
    "serious, rapid and irreversible  decline  in  the  appellant's  health
    resulting in intense suffering" or "a  significant  reduction  in  life
    expectancy" and that there was no evidence of an absence of appropriate
    treatment in India or that the appellant would be unable to access  it.



25. On behalf of the appellant, Ms Imamovic submitted that in her  skeleton
    argument before the FTT she had made specific reference to, and  relied
    upon, Dr Nabavi's addendum report.  She understood that that report was
    before the judge.  She anticipated that the judge would  take  it  into
    account in assessing the appellant's mental health and the implications
    to him of returning to India.  In particular,  that  report  recognises
    that, in April 2020,  the  appellant  "continues  suffering  from  both
    residual and acute symptoms of recurrent depressive disorder" (at  para
    30).  At para 33 it states:

         "In addition, I felt that [the appellant] had developed a  worrying
         sense of hopelessness and helplessness with further increase in the
         intensity and frequency of suicidal preoccupation".

26. Then at para 37, Dr Nabavi expresses the following opinion:

         "In my opinion, on the balance of probabilities I believe that [the
         appellant's] psychiatric condition is highly likely to deteriorate,
         should he be forced to move out of the United Kingdom".

27. At para 39, Dr Nabavi concludes:

         "Henceforth,  considering  his  overall  physical  and  psychiatric
         states and his family and cultural background, I  have  significant
         concerns about his safety, including his mental health and  further
         increase in the risk of suicide, should he be returned to [India]".

28. Ms Imamovic submitted that the judge, had she taken this material  into
    account, might have reached a different conclusion in relation  to  the
    appellant's claim based upon a risk of suicide and Art 3 of  the  ECHR.
    She submitted that, given that it was clear from her skeleton  argument
    that she relied on this report and made specific reference to it, there
    was a procedural irregularity and unfairness when  the  judge  did  not
    alert her to the fact that the report was not available to the judge.

29. Mr Tan, on behalf  of  the  Secretary  of  State,  submitted  that  the
    appellant's case was essentially one of fairness.  He submitted that Ms
    Imamovic had indicated to the judge, as recorded  at  para  18  of  her
    decision, that there was no additional documents apart  from  case  law
    and country guidance referred to in the appellant's  skeleton  argument
    which she need consult.  In  any  event,  Mr  Tan  submitted  that,  in
    effect, the judge's failure to refer to the addendum expert report  was
    not material  to  her  decision  as  the  judge  accepted  Dr  Nabavi's
    diagnosis in 2018 in his report.  The addendum report did no more  than
    mirror that original report.

30. Had Dr Nabavi's addendum report been part of the documents before Judge
    Barker, it would undoubtedly have been an error of law for the judge to
    fail to take it into account.  Here, however, it is accepted that Judge
    Barker did not have a copy of the addendum  report.   It  is  accepted,
    however, that the report was sent by the appellant's representatives to
    both the First-tier Tribunal and the respondent.  That, in my judgment,
    is a proper conclusion given the witness statement dated 2 October 2020
    signed by Mr Khan,  a  solicitor  representing  the  appellant  and  is
    supported by the outgoing post ledger, a copy of which was  filed  with
    that statement.  I have no hesitation in accepting  that  the  addendum
    report was, at least, sent to both  the  FtT  and  to  the  respondent.
    However, the evidence, in the form of emails  from  both  the  Tribunal
    administration and the Home Office, record that there is no  record  of
    either having received that expert report.  I am not in a position,  on
    the basis of the material before me, to do anything other  than  accept
    that evidence.  There is no record of the addendum expert report in the
    Tribunal's file that I have seen.

31. I do, however, accept that the addendum report was sent  and  that  the
    appellant's legal representatives and,  Ms  Imamovic,  the  appellant's
    counsel at the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal, assumed that the
    addendum report had been filed with the Tribunal and was  part  of  the
    evidence in the appeal.  As I have said, it is specifically referred to
    at a number of points in Ms Imamovic's skeleton argument for the First-
    tier Tribunal (see paras 10, 21 and 25).  It does not  appear  that  Ms
    Imamovic specifically drew the addendum report to the judge's attention
    in her oral submissions.  However, given that the  representatives  had
    every expectation that the addendum report had  been  received  by  the
    Tribunal and was part of the appeal, it is perhaps not surprising  that
    Ms Imamovic did not specifically refer to  it  as  a  further  document
    relied on at the date of the hearing.  It was, I accept, simply seen to
    be part of the papers in the appeal filed in advance of the hearing.

32. No authority  was  drawn  to  my  attention  by  either  representative
    directly relevant  to  establishing  whether  the  judge's  failure  to
    consider the report, or more accurately draw to the parties'  attention
    that it was absent from her file, amounted to a procedural irregularity
    amounting to an error of law or was unfair.  It is trite to state  that
    the requirements of fairness and procedural error amounting to an error
    of law are not fixed and must be  applied  flexibly  according  to  the
    context - the requirements are not "engraved on tablets of stone"  (see
    Lloyd v McMahon [1987] AC 625 per Lord Bridge at p.702). Further, while
    in general an individual will be fixed with any errors or  mistakes  by
    his representatives, a more flexible approach may be applied  where  an
    important right (or a matter of "life and death") is at stake  such  as
    may arise in an international protection  case  (see  FP(Iran)  v  SSHD
    [2007] EWCA Civ 13 at [43]-[46] per Sedley LJ).

33. There was, it is clear, a misunderstanding at the  hearing  as  to  the
    material lodged with the FtT.  Equally, it is clear that the  appellant
    and his counsel were unaware that the addendum report was not available
    to the judge but it was relied upon by counsel as establishing the  up-
    to-date position concerning the appellant's mental health.  It was,  as
    the judge's reasoning  makes  clear,  significant  that  there  was  no
    current expert evidence as to the appellant's mental  health.   In  the
    passages which I have cited earlier, the judge repeatedly  referred  to
    the fact that there was no evidence concerning his mental health beyond
    2018.  It seems to me, bearing in mind the significance that the  judge
    placed upon the absence of any up-to-date  expert  evidence  concerning
    the  appellant's  mental  health,  on  reading  the  skeleton  argument
    submitted by Ms Imamovic (which was a very detailed one) and which made
    specific reference to the addendum report and the passages in it  which
    cast light on the appellant's current mental health, that there  was  a
    procedural irregularity that, in all the circumstances, made the First-
    tier Tribunal's proceedings unfair.

34. In saying that, I do not suggest that it is  necessarily  unfair  if  a
    judge does not draw to the attention of one or more of the parties  the
    fact that particular evidence is not  available.   However,  where  the
    parties specifically rely upon evidence which, on a fair assessment  of
    the circumstances, it is assumed by the parties  is  available  to  the
    judge, then to continue to determine  an  appeal  without  drawing  the
    mistaken understanding to the parties in order to allow them to rectify
    the omission of the material, is capable of leading to unfairness and a
    procedural irregularity amounting to an error  of  law.   That,  in  my
    judgment, was the situation pertaining at the hearing before the First-
    tier Tribunal in this appeal.

35. I do not accept Mr Tan's submission that the evidence  was  immaterial.
    The  significance  of  the  absence  of  this  evidence  was  a  matter
    particularly noted by the judge in reaching her adverse  conclusion  in
    respect of the appellant's Art 3 claim.  As is clear from the  addendum
    report, Dr Nabavi expressed the view, not  simply  that  the  appellant
    continued to suffer from depressive disorder, but that he continued  to
    have suicidal thoughts with an increase in the intensity and  frequency
    of his suicidal preoccupation and that if he were forced to  leave  the
    UK his psychiatric condition was "highly likely to  deteriorate"  (para
    37) and that there was a "further increase  in  the  risk  of  suicide"
    (para 39).  This was evidence which was highly material to the  judge's
    assessment of whether the appellant had  established  a  real  risk  of
    suicide (J v SSHD [2005] EWCA Civ 629 at  [25]-[31])  and  whether  his
    claim fell within the (albeit high) threshold for Art 3 claims set  out
    by the  Supreme  Court  in  in  AM  (Zimbabwe).   I  accept  that  they
    established a 'prima facie' case and that,  following  AM(Zimbabwe)  at
    [33], the issue of availability and accessibility of treatment in India
    became a matter upon which, at least in part, an obligation  fell  upon
    the respondent.

36. For these reasons, I am not persuaded that if the judge had  considered
    the addendum report it was certain or inevitable that  she  would  have
    reached the same conclusion in respect of Art 3.  She may have  made  a
    different finding in the appellant's favour.

37. An additional point made  in  relation  to  ground  1  is  the  judge's
    treatment of the GP letters at paras 119-126 of  her  decision.   There
    the judge referred to a letter from Dr Krishan dated 25 April 2019  and
    another from the same doctor dated 4 February 2020.  There was  also  a
    further letter dated 5 February 2020 from the Black Country Partnership
    NHS Trust confirming that, after referral, the appellant was discharged
    from a course of CBT in September 2019.  These GP records  confirm  the
    appellant's mental health problems and that he was treated  with  anti-
    depressants in the form of Sertraline and counselling.  It may be, that
    in terms of importance, these documents were less significant than  the
    addendum report of Dr Nabavi.  However, they were at least confirmatory
    of a number  of  matters  concerning  the  appellant's  current  mental
    health.  As regards the first letter the judge said this at para 120:

         "120.    However, this letter fails to comply with  the  Tribunal's
             Practice Direction Part  10  regarding  expert  evidence.   In
             particular, it is not addressed to the Tribunal, nor  verified
             by a statement of truth, and it does not contain  a  statement
             that the expert understands their duty to the Tribunal and has
             complied and will continue to comply with that  duty.   It  is
             simply a brief letter saying only what  is  referenced  above,
             bearing only a stamp signature, and an address to 'whom it may
             concern'".

38. The judge adopted that reasoning in relation to the other letters  also
    (see paras 122 and 125).  She then concluded at para 126:

         "126.    In these circumstances, I find the absence  of  compliance
             with the Practice Direction diminishes the  evidential  weight
             of anything that may be  contained  in  the  letters  detailed
             above.  I also find there is no  reliable  evidence  detailing
             the appellant's mental health state since March 2018, some two
             and a � years ago".

39. I accept Ms Imamovic's submission that the judge was wrong to  conclude
    that a diminished or lesser weight should be given to the GP's evidence
    because it did  not  comply  with  the  Practice  Direction  on  expert
    evidence.  These letters were not being submitted as  expert  evidence.
    They were evidence from the appellant's GP  as  to  his  treatment  and
    mental health condition.  They were evidence, like any  other  evidence
    in a case, albeit emanating from the appellant's  GP.   They  were,  on
    that basis, entitled to such weight as was appropriate to their content
    given  the  circumstances,  namely  that  they  originated   from   the
    appellant's GP who had treated and had the care of the appellant.  As I
    have said, these were not expert reports  which  should  have  complied
    with the requirements of the Practice  Direction  on  expert  evidence.
    The judge erred in treating them as such and giving them lesser  weight
    as a result.  Of course, as I have said their significance is, perhaps,
    less than the expert evidence of Dr Nabavi  included  in  his  addendum
    report but, nevertheless, they  were  evidence  in  the  case  and  the
    judge's mischaracterisation of  them  further  compounded  the  judge's
    error in assessing the  appellant's  mental  health  and  the  risk  of
    suicide on return to India.

40. For these reasons, I am satisfied that there was a  material  error  of
    law in the judge's assessment of the appellant's claim under Art  3  of
    the ECHR.

    Ground 2

41. Although the judge's assessment of the appellant's  mental  health  and
    future prognosis was primarily an issue under Art 3 of  the  ECHR,  the
    judge also referred to her findings  in  relation  to  the  appellant's
    mental  health  when  making  her  adverse  credibility  assessment  in
    relation to the appellant's asylum claim.  At para 77 she said:

         "77. I confirm in making the credibility finding as I  do,  that  I
             have had regard to the medical evidence  (considered  in  more
             detail below) provided by the  appellant,  and  in  particular
             that contained at  pages  17  and  31-59  of  the  appellant's
             bundle, and his diagnosis of mental  health  issues.   I  have
             also had regard to the Presidential  Guidance  Note  No  2  of
             2010: Child,  Vulnerable  and  Sensitive  Appellant  Guidance,
             10.3, and the relevant passage of the  Equal  Treatment  Bench
             Book, February 2011 edition (March 2020 version), and borne in
             mind the appellant's health issues when assessing the evidence
             in the round and his credibility generally".

42. It would seem, therefore, that any error in  relation  to  the  judge's
    assessment of the appellant's mental health condition, and the evidence
    relating to it, spilt over  into  her  assessment  of  the  appellant's
    credibility.  That, in itself, calls into question  the  sustainability
    of the judge's adverse credibility finding.

43. However, in my judgment, there are a number of  matters  raised  by  Ms
    Imamovic in relation to the judge's adverse credibility  finding  which
    make it unsustainable in any  event  (at  para  2(d)  of  her  skeleton
    argument).  It is only necessary to refer to  a  number  which,  in  my
    judgment,  are  significant  such  that  I  agree  that   the   adverse
    credibility finding is unsustainable.

44.  First,  the  judge  identified  what  she  described  as  "significant
    discrepancies" in the appellant's account and that these "significantly
    undermine the appellant's credibility" (see para  60).   One  of  those
    inconsistencies  concerned  his  evidence  about  the   assaults,   the
    appellant claimed, he had been subject to in India.   At  paras  62-66,
    the judge said this:

         "62. The appellant said that he received threats from the committee
             members between 2007 and 2010 when he  eventually  left  India
             (RB Annex C Q63 & 64).  The appellant also states in the  same
             interview that he was assaulted by the same committee  members
             about four times in 2007 and 2008 (RB Annex C  Q65-67).   When
             asked specifically when this happened, the appellant said that
             the first time was the end of 2007, the  middle  of  2008  and
             then twice in 2008 (RB Annex C Q67).

         63.  The appellant then says that he was assaulted  in  2009,  just
             before he made an application for a visa (Annex C Q80).

         64.  The appellant now claims that he was assaulted once  in  2007,
             one in 2008 and twice in 2009 (Supplementary witness statement
             para 4).  He claims that the interview  record  is  incorrect,
             and that in fact he did say that he had been  assaulted  twice
             in 2009.

         65.  Even if I accept that the record is incorrect, the appellant's
             first witness statement is inconsistent on this point, in that
             statement the appellant clearly states that he  was  assaulted
             in 2007, again in the middle of 2008, and a couple of times in
             the end of 2008 or beginning of 2009, and again in 2009 (AB  2
             paras 11 to 15).

         66.  Even accepting that the appellant  may  struggle  to  remember
             specific dates, I find these inconsistencies  significant.   I
             accept that some time has  passed  since  the  appellant  left
             India, but given the significance of  the  incidents  that  he
             alleges, I would expect him to be consistent on the number  of
             times and when he had been subject to violence as he  claims".



45. Whilst, as Mr Tan submitted, the judge was correct to identify that the
    appellant had inconsistently said he had been assaulted  four  or  five
    times, the inconsistency as to  when  he  was  assaulted  is  far  less
    sustainable.  What the appellant said at question 67 of  his  interview
    was that he was assaulted: "First time was end of 2007, middle of 2008,
    and twice in 2008".

46. The appellant, at least in part, claimed that  this  was  an  incorrect
    transcription of what he had said.  It is, as  I  pointed  out  at  the
    hearing, clearly just that.  It  is  difficult  to  conceive  that  the
    appellant said that he had been assaulted in the  middle  of  2008  and
    then again twice in 2008.  That would mean that he was  saying  he  had
    been assaulted three  time  in  2008  but,  for  no  apparent  reasons,
    described it as assaults on  one  plus  two  further  occasions.   More
    likely, and indeed consistently with what he had  said  elsewhere,  was
    that the appellant said he had been assaulted in the middle of 2008 and
    then twice in 2009.  Of course, his evidence was that he may have  been
    assaulted at the end of 2008 or the beginning of 2009 and then again in
    2009.   That  level  of  'inconsistency'  may,  however,  be  far  less
    significant  than  Q67  as  read  by  the  judge.   The   relied   upon
    inconsistency in his  evidence  by  reference  to  Q67  of  his  asylum
    interview is, in my judgment, unsustainable to the extent  it  is  said
    that the appellant was not claiming that he had been assaulted in 2009.
     He may have been inconsistent as to whether he was assaulted  four  or
    five times  but,  correcting  the  interview  record  for  the  obvious
    mistranscription that it contains, it is  difficult  to  see  how  that
    error could be described as "significant"  such  as  to  "significantly
    undermine the appellant's credibility".

47. Secondly, I accept Ms Imamovic's submission  that  the  judge  was  not
    entitled to find that the arrest warrant was unreliable because it  was
    implausible, having been first issued in  2009  and  then  reissued  in
    2018.  The judge rejected the appellant's explanation that  the  arrest
    warrant was reissued because the authorities needed to prepare the case
    to have it ready so that they would be prepared for the instigation  of
    charges against the appellant.  At para 88, the judge said this:

         "88. In my view, this explanation is non-sensical, because  of  the
             appellant's own account, the authorities issued  this  warrant
             initially in 2009, so they would only have issued the  warrant
             then, once the case had been prepared  against  him  and  they
             would have been ready for his arrest at that  time,  so  there
             would be no need to prepare the case  again  and  reissue  the
             same warrant nine years later".

48. The appellant was, of course, only offering his opinion as to  how  the
    police, and legal  system  in  India,  operated.   The  judge  made  no
    reference to any background evidence  that  would  support  either  the
    appellant's explanation or  support  the  judge's  conclusion  that  an
    arrest warrant would not be reissued some years after it was  initially
    issued.  The judge had no information about the operation of the Indian
    legal system in that regard.  Without it,  the  implausibility  of  the
    arrest warrant being reissued in India (even if it would not happen  in
    the UK) was pure speculation and, the reasoning is unsustainable in the
    absence of background evidence to support it (see HK v SSHD [2006] EWCA
    Civ 1037 at [29]-[30]; and Y v SSHD [2006] EWCA Civ 1223 at [27}).

49. Thirdly, the judge was highly critical of the reliability of the arrest
    warrant because it referred to offences under ss.406  and  420  of  the
    Indian Penal Code.  The former related to an offence of criminal breach
    of trust but specifically only referred  to  the  punishment  for  that
    offence.  The offence itself was in s.405 of the Code.  Section 420  of
    the Code related to the offence of "cheating and  dishonestly  inducing
    delivery of property" whilst the appellant claimed  that  he  had  been
    accused of theft.  That offence, the judge noted  at  para  91  of  her
    decision, was found in s.378 of the Code.  The  judge  reasoned  first,
    that the arrest  warrant  would  refer  to  the  section  creating  the
    offence, namely s.405 rather than s.406; and, secondly, that  it  would
    refer directly to the specific Code provision creating the  offence  of
    theft rather than the one of cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery
    of property if the appellant had, as he claimed, been accused of theft.



50. I find this reasoning troubling and further  calls  into  question  the
    sustainability of the adverse credibility finding.  First, it fails  to
    have regard to the fact that the appellant was claiming that a criminal
    process had been begun against him which was false.   It  assumes  that
    within  that  process  the  Indian  criminal   justice   system   would
    necessarily wholly accurately reflect the offences which the  appellant
    was said to have committed.  Secondly, and perhaps more  significantly,
    it assumes that the appellant who said he had been told  what  offences
    he had been falsely accused of had accurately (and  correctly)  claimed
    he was wanted for theft rather than the offence involving cheating  and
    dishonestly inducing the delivery of property.

51. Although, as Mr Tan submitted, the judge gave a number of  reasons  for
    reaching her adverse credibility finding, I am not satisfied  that  the
    errors I have identified, taken together with the reading across of her
    findings in  relation  to  the  appellant's  mental  health,  have  not
    affected her adverse credibility finding.  She stated that  there  were
    "significant  discrepancies"   in   the   appellant's   account   which
    "significantly undermined" his credibility.  The documents were  relied
    upon by the appellant to support a core  part  of  his  claim.   In  my
    judgment, it is not possible to disconnect and excise the errors in her
    reasoning I have identified and be satisfied that inevitably she  would
    have reached the same adverse credibility finding.

52.  Consequently,  for  these  reasons  I  am  satisfied  that  the  judge
    materially erred in law in reaching her adverse credibility finding  in
    relation of the appellant's  asylum  claim  which,  therefore,  is  not
    sustainable.

    Ground 3

53. Neither representative sought to sustain the judge's adverse conclusion
    under para 276ADE(1)(vi) and Art 8  outside  the  Rules  if  her  other
    adverse findings (challenged in Grounds 1 and  2)  were  unsustainable.
    That, in my judgment,  is  an  entirely  proper  stance.   The  judge's
    assessment of the appellant's Art 8 claim was  necessarily  tainted  by
    her earlier adverse findings which cannot be sustained.

Decision

54. For the above reasons, the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to
    dismiss the appellant's appeal involved the making of an error of  law.
    That decision cannot stand and is set aside.

55. Having regard to para 7.2 of the Senior President's Practice Statement,
    the proper disposal of this appeal is to remit  it  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal for a de novo  rehearing  before  a  judge  other  than  Judge
    Barker.  No findings are preserved.

                                                                      Signed
