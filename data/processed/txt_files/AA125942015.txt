                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction and Background

 1. The Appellant appeals against the decision  of  Judge  Brunnen  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal (the FTT) promulgated on 3rd June 2016.

 2. The Appellant is a female citizen of the Ivory Coast born 25th  January
    1986.

 3. The Appellant entered the United Kingdom as an  unaccompanied  17  year
    old minor on 26th November 2003.  Her asylum claim was refused and  her
    subsequent appeal dismissed  by  Adjudicator  Cruthers  in  a  decision
    promulgated on 4th November 2004.

 4. The Appellant remained in the United Kingdom unlawfully and made  fresh
    submissions in April 2011 and August 2015 which the Respondent accepted
    as a fresh claim, and on 17th September 2015 the Respondent refused  to
    grant the Appellant asylum or humanitarian protection, and decided that
    her removal from the United Kingdom would not breach any of  her  human
    rights protected by the 1950 European Convention on Human  Rights  (the
    1950 Convention).

 5. The Appellant appealed to the  FTT,  pursuant  to  section  82  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (the 2002 Act).

 6. The appeal before the FTT was pursued only on Article 8  grounds.   The
    FTT heard evidence from the Appellant and her fianc�, and decided  that
    the Appellant could not satisfy the provisions of Appendix  FM  of  the
    Immigration Rules in relation  to  family  life.   The  FTT  considered
    paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) and found that there were no  very  significant
    obstacles to the Appellant's reintegration into  the  Ivory  Coast  and
    therefore the appeal was dismissed on that basis.

 7. The FTT went on to consider Article 8 of the  1950  Convention  outside
    the  Immigration  Rules,  and  found  that  there  were  no  compelling
    circumstances which would justify a grant of leave  to  remain  outside
    the Immigration Rules.  The appeal was therefore also dismissed on that
    basis.

 8. The Appellant applied for permission to appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal
    relying upon two grounds.

 9. The grounds are set out over four pages,  and  therefore  will  not  be
    repeated in full here.  In brief summary it was firstly contended  that
    the FTT had erred in considering paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) by failing  to
    consider relevant issues, case law and evidence.

10. Secondly it was contended that the FTT had erred in considering Article
    8 outside the Immigration Rules by relying upon a  flawed  approach  to
    paragraph 276ADE and had erred in failing to consider what would happen
    to the family life that the FTT had found existed between the Appellant
    and her fianc�.  It was further contended that the FTT  had  failed  to
    consider Chikwamba v SSHD [2008] UKHL 40 which was a material error.

11. Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Kamara in  the
    following terms;

         "3.  It is arguable that the judge failed to carry out  a  holistic
             assessment of the Appellant's circumstances; Bossade (ss.117A-
             D-interrelationship with Rules) [2015] UKUT 00415, headnote 5.
              It is similarly arguable, given the judge's finding  that  it
             was  unreasonable  to  expect  the  Appellant's   partner   to
             accompany her to the Ivory Coast,  that  the  judge  erred  in
             failing to engage with the case law of Chikwamba v SSHD [2008]
             UKHL 40.

         4.   All grounds may be argued."

12. Following the grant of permission  the  Respondent  lodged  a  response
    pursuant to Rule 24 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 contending that the FTT had not erred in law.   It  was  contended
    that the FTT  had  correctly  considered  paragraph  276ADE(1)(vi)  and
    Article 8 outside the Immigration  Rules  and  the  grounds  of  appeal
    amounted to a disagreement with findings that had been properly made.

13. Directions were subsequently issued making provision for there to be  a
    hearing before the Upper Tribunal to decide whether  the  FTT  decision
    should be set aside.

The Appellant's Submissions

14. Mr Schwenk had not seen the Rule 24 response and therefore was provided
    with a copy.

15. In making oral submissions Mr Schwenk  relied  and  expanded  upon  the
    grounds contained within the application for permission to appeal.

16. With reference to paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) it was contended that the FTT
    had erred at paragraph  38.   At  the  previous  appeal,  it  had  been
    accepted that the Appellant had been raped in  the  Ivory  Coast  as  a
    child, and that she fled from a forced marriage and from a risk of FGM.
     The FTT failed to consider the Appellant's subjective fears about  her
    return to the Ivory Coast.  It was submitted that in paragraph  38  the
    FTT had conflated the test for asylum, and  the  test  under  paragraph
    276ADE which amounted to a material error of law.  Mr  Schwenk  pointed
    out that in the previous appeal hearing  in  2004  there  had  been  no
    finding made in relation to Article 8.  The Appellant's appeal had been
    dismissed in 2004 because it was found that there was a sufficiency  of
    protection available, and a reasonable internal relocation option.

17. It was submitted that at paragraph 40 the FTT had failed to  take  into
    account the Appellant's subjective fear of return when concluding  that
    there was no reason why she could not make new  friendships  or  revive
    old ones.

18. At paragraph 41 the FTT had erred by  failing  to  consider  background
    evidence which demonstrated safety and  security  risks  in  the  Ivory
    Coast, together with high risks of crime and terrorism.

19. The FTT had at  paragraph  37  noted  that  the  Appellant  had  "grown
    accustomed to life in the UK", but  had  been  asked  to  consider  the
    Appellant's westernisation which was a somewhat different  issue.   The
    FTT had failed to do so.

20. It was submitted that  the  FTT  had  been  referred  to  Bossade,  and
    Ogundimu Nigeria [2013] UKUT 60 (IAC) but failed to apply and  consider
    that case law, and had failed to carry out an  holistic  assessment  of
    the Appellant's circumstances.

21. With reference to Article 8 outside the Immigration Rules, the FTT  had
    stated at paragraph 46 that several issues had already been  considered
    under paragraph 276ADE, but it was contended that the assessment  under
    paragraph  276ADE  was  inadequate  and  fundamentally  flawed,   which
    therefore  meant  that  the  Article  8  consideration,   outside   the
    Immigration Rules, was also flawed.

22. The FTT had made no finding as to what would happen to the  Appellant's
    family life with her fianc� if he remained in the  United  Kingdom  and
    she returned to the  Ivory  Coast,  and  had  failed  to  consider  the
    principles in Chikwamba.

The Respondent's Submissions

23. Mr Bates relied upon the Rule 24 response.  Mr Bates submitted that the
    FTT had made findings which were open to  make  on  the  evidence,  and
    provided cogent reasons for those findings.  The FTT had been  entitled
    to note the absence of any medical or psychiatric evidence in  relation
    to fear of return to the Ivory Coast.

24. Mr Bates submitted  that  the  FTT  had  considered  all  the  relevant
    evidence, made appropriate findings,  and  the  decision  disclosed  no
    error of law in relation to paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi).

25. With reference to Article 8 outside the Rules, it was not accepted that
    the consideration of paragraph 276ADE was inadequate, and the  FTT  had
    correctly applied section 117B of the  2002  Act.   With  reference  to
    Chikwamba, Mr Bates submitted that the FTT could have made reference to
    R (on the application of Chen) IJR [2015] UKUT 00189 (IAC) which  would
    in fact have strengthened the Respondent's case.  It was also submitted
    that the FTT could have considered whether the Appellant and her fianc�
    could reside in Ireland, as the fianc� is from  Northern  Ireland.   It
    was not however suggested that these  omissions  amounted  to  material
    errors of law.

The Appellant's Response

26. Mr Schwenk submitted that Mr Bates had sought to put forward  arguments
    that had not been before the FTT and therefore should not be taken into
    account.

27. At the conclusion of oral submissions I reserved my decision.

My Conclusions and Reasons

28. I have considered all that is  contained  within  the  application  for
    permission to appeal,  together  with  the  submissions  made  by  both
    representatives.

29. I consider firstly paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi).  The FTT at  paragraphs  36
    and 37 appreciates that the appropriate test is whether there are  very
    significant obstacles to  the  Appellant  reintegrating  in  the  Ivory
    Coast, and accepts that the Appellant arrived in the United Kingdom  at
    17 years of age, and had lived in this country for twelve years,  those
    twelve years constituting all her adult life.   It  was  also  accepted
    that the appellant had "grown accustomed to life in  the  UK  and  that
    returning to the Ivory Coast would be a real challenge."

30. The above in my view is fair and accurate.  I  find  no  merit  in  the
    criticism that the FTT did not consider the Appellant's westernisation.
     The FTT was aware of the appropriate legal test,  and  the  length  of
    time that the Appellant had been in this country.

31. At paragraph 38 the FTT considered the findings made in the Appellant's
    previous appeal and noted what had been accepted  by  the  Adjudicator.
    The FTT therefore accepted that "The Appellant must have  bad  memories
    of the Ivory Coast and also that she is most unlikely to wish to  renew
    contact with her mother.  She would clearly wish to avoid  any  contact
    with a man to whom her parents gave her."  The FTT  went  on  to  state
    that these issues were found not to be sufficient to  justify  allowing
    the Appellant to remain in the UK in 2004 and that  situation  has  not
    changed.

32. I do not find that the FTT conflated the test for asylum and  the  test
    under paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi).  The FTT set out  at  paragraph  36  the
    appropriate  test,  that  being  whether  there  are  very  significant
    obstacles to reintegration.

33. I have  considered  the  previous  determination,  and  note  that  the
    Appellant's previous appeal was dismissed because the Adjudicator found
    that there was both a  sufficiency  of  protection,  and  a  reasonable
    internal relocation option within Ivory Coast.  I accept that Article 8
    was not considered in the previous determination.

34. The FTT considers at paragraph  49  the  psychological  impact  of  the
    Appellant returning to the Ivory Coast, and  the  separation  from  her
    fianc�.  The FTT pertinently notes the lack  of  any  relevant  medical
    evidence, and was  entitled,  in  the  absence  of  such  evidence,  to
    conclude that "I cannot infer that she would suffer mental illness as a
    result of separation."  I find no error of law on this issue.

35. In my view it was open to the FTT to find  in  paragraphs  40  and  41,
    taking into account the previous finding that  there  is  a  reasonable
    internal relocation option available in the Ivory  Coast,  no  apparent
    reason why the Appellant could not make new friendships  in  the  Ivory
    Coast, or join a church and have a fulfilling religious life.  The  FTT
    was entitled to note that the Appellant could still  speak  French  and
    that the ability to speak English may be of benefit  to  her.   It  was
    accepted  that  it  would  not  be  easy  for  the  Appellant  to  find
    employment, but the evidence did not indicate that the  prospects  were
    so poor that the Appellant would be likely to  fall  into  destitution.
    There is no error of law disclosed in these conclusions.

36. I do not accept that the FTT failed to take into account the background
    evidence.  It  is  specifically  confirmed  in  paragraph  5  that  the
    evidence in the Appellant's bundle  was  considered.   That  background
    evidence makes reference to  there  being  risk  in  the  Ivory  Coast,
    although the Appellant's appeal was not put on the basis that she would
    be at risk if returned.

37. The FTT does not have to refer to specific case  law  if  the  decision
    demonstrates that all  material  evidence  and  submissions  have  been
    considered and analysed.  The FTT decision demonstrates this.  The  FTT
    has taken into account all the evidence  submitted  on  behalf  of  the
    Appellant, and applied the appropriate test,  and  concluded  that  the
    Appellant has  not  satisfied  the  burden  of  proof  in  relation  to
    paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi), and did not  err  in  law  in  reaching  those
    conclusions.

38. Turning to Article 8 outside the Immigration Rules, I do not accept the
    submission   that   the   FTT   inadequately    considered    paragraph
    276ADE(1)(vi), and therefore I do not accept that the consideration  of
    Article 8 outside the Immigration Rules is flawed because of this.

39. The FTT found that it would not be reasonable to expect the Appellant's
    fianc� to travel to the Ivory Coast, but  found  it  proportionate  and
    reasonable for the Appellant to be returned to the country of which she
    is a  citizen.   It  is  therefore  clear  that  the  FTT  envisaged  a
    separation and an interference with the Appellant's family life.  It is
    a matter for the  Appellant  to  decide  whether  to  apply  for  entry
    clearance from the Ivory Coast, and it is not appropriate for  the  FTT
    to speculate as to whether such an application would be made, and if an
    application was made, the result of such an application.

40. When considering  Article  8  the  FTT  applied  the  correct  test  in
    accordance with SS (Congo) [2015] EWCA  Civ  387,  in  that  compelling
    circumstances would be needed to justify a grant of leave to remain  if
    the Immigration Rules were not satisfied.

41. I find no error committed by the FTT in concluding  that  the  evidence
    did not demonstrate compelling circumstances.

42. With reference to Chikwamba the FTT could have referred to Chen,  which
    in very brief summary stated, inter  alia,  that  Lord  Brown  was  not
    laying down a legal test when he suggested in Chikwamba that  requiring
    a Claimant to make  an  application  for  entry  clearance  would  only
    comparatively rarely be proportionate in a case involving children.  In
    this case children are not involved,  and  Chen  stated  in  the  first
    paragraph of the headnote, that it "will not be enough to  rely  solely
    upon the case law concerning Chikwamba v SSHD [2008] UKHL 40."

43. In conclusion I do not find that the FTT erred in  law  in  considering
    paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) or Article 8  outside  the  Immigration  Rules.
    Findings made by the FTT were open to it upon  the  evidence,  and  the
    grounds disclose a disagreement in the conclusions reached, but do  not
    disclose any material error of law.



Notice of Decision

The making of the decision of the FTT  did  not  involve  the  making  of  a
material error on a point of law.  I do not set  aside  the  decision.   The
appeal is dismissed.

Anonymity

No anonymity direction was  made  by  the  FTT.   However  in  view  of  the
reference to the Appellant's treatment in the Ivory  Coast  I  have  decided
that it is appropriate to make an anonymity order pursuant  to  Rule  14  of
the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules  2008.   Unless  and  until  a
Tribunal or court directs otherwise, the  Appellant  is  granted  anonymity.
No report of these proceedings shall directly or indirectly identify her  or
any member of her family.  This direction applies both to the Appellant  and
to the Respondent.  Failure to comply with  this  direction  could  lead  to
contempt of court proceedings.
