                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. These are the Appellants' appeals against the decision of Judge  Mensah
    made following a hearing at Bradford on 18th February 2014.

Background

 2. The first Appellant is a citizen of Nigeria and the second a citizen of
    Latvia.  The first Appellant made an application for a  residence  card
    as confirmation of a right to reside in the UK on the  basis  that  his
    EEA family  member,  the  second  Appellant,   was  a  jobseeker.   The
    Secretary of State  considered  that  insufficient  evidence  had  been
    provided to demonstrate that she was currently a qualified  person  and
    the claimant was therefore refused  his  application  for  a  residence
    card.

 3. The Appellants appealed and by the  date  of  the  hearing  the  second
    Appellant claimed to be in self employment.

 4. The judge briefly set out the background to the appeal and  then  wrote
    as follows:

         "The Appellant's maternity allowance ceased on 14 January 2012.  On
         the evidence before  me  the  Appellant  was  registered  with  the
         employment office as unemployed on 10  September  2012.   Therefore
         the Appellant had a period of more than six months  where  she  was
         unemployed and  not  registered  with  the  employment  office  and
         therefore did not meet the qualified person criteria at that  time.
         The Appellant registered as self-employed on the 21 July 2013.  The
         Appellant has failed to provide evidence to substantiate  that  she
         continued to be registered  with  the  employment  office  for  the
         entire period to 21 July 2013.  The Appellant therefore has  failed
         to show that she was registered with an employment  department  but
         in any event  this  period  was  in  excess  of  six  months.   The
         Appellant gave evidence that she was  self-employed  from  21  July
         2013 onwards.  The Appellant has produced evidence in the  form  of
         hand written receipts and declarations of earnings to the  relevant
         benefit department of �380 to �400 for the entire  period  from  21
         July 2013 to the date of the  hearing.   This  equates  to  average
         monthly earnings of �58.  I do not accept that  the  Appellant  has
         shown she was genuinely self-employed, moreover this  was  done  to
         create the appearance of being self-employed.  I take into  account
         the inability of the Appellant to provide accurate details in cross-
         examination of her business, in particular the Appellant was unable
         to tell me how much profit  she  had  made  out  of  the  �400.   I
         consider any person genuinely self-employed  in  a  small  business
         would be able to provide accurate information as to  their  profit.
         In those circumstances the Appellant has failed to demonstrate that
         she  currently  meets  the  criteria  as  a  qualified  person  and
         therefore both her appeal and the appeal of  the  second  Appellant
         fails under the Regulations."

 5. The judge declined to consider the Article 8 grounds and dismissed  the
    appeal.

The Grounds of Application

 6. The Appellant sought permission to appeal on the grounds that the judge
    had erred in failing to properly consider that the Appellant was  self-
    employed.  The judge was only able to give one example of an  inability
    to provide accurate details in cross-examination  and  the  expectation
    that all genuine  small  business  people  would  be  able  to  provide
    accurate information about their profit at any given time e.g. part-way
    through a tax year, was unrealistic and unreasonable.  For the judge to
    find that the self-employment was not genuine on  the  basis  that  the
    Appellant, in a  stressful  court  environment,  needed  to  check  her
    paperwork before she could give an accurate figure for  her  profit  to
    date was perverse.

 7. Moreover she had failed to take into account the  substantial  evidence
    that the Appellant was genuinely  self-employed  including  registering
    with the relevant authorities, paying national insurance  contributions
    and the oral evidence.  The Appellant was  actually  creating  her  own
    products and selling them and the judge gave no  reason  for  rejecting
    her substantial evidence.

 8. Second, the judge was wrong not to consider Article  8  since  she  did
    have jurisdiction not only because the  second  Appellant's  notice  of
    immigration decision entitled him to appeal but also because  of  Ahmed
    (Amos; Zambrano; Reg 15A(3)(c) 2006 EEA Regs) [2013] UKUT  00089  which
    held that there was jurisdiction to consider Article 8 in cases  where,
    for example, there has been a refusal of a permanent residence card.

 9. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge Ievins who stated that it was
    arguable  that  the  judge  failed  to  engage  with  the  evidence  in
    sufficient detail to such an extent that her decision  failed  to  take
    into account relevant facts and so falls into arguable  material  error
    of law.

The hearing

10. Mr Diwnycz made a telephone call to the Inland Revenue who informed him
    that the  EEA  national  Appellant  had  registered  online  for  self-
    employment on 31st July 2013 and had been trading since 22nd July 2013.



11. He conceded that she was self-employed as claimed and had been  at  the
    date of the hearing before the judge.

Findings and Conclusions

12. This determination is not an adequate reconsideration of  the  evidence
    which was before the judge, and which was not recorded.   It  is  clear
    that oral evidence was given of the business, and how  the  goods  were
    advertised.  Moreover there was the evidence from the  Inland  Revenue,
    which is the basis  of  the  present  concession,  and  which  was  not
    referred to in the determination.

13. Moreover, although not mentioned in the grounds, the judge erred in her
    consideration of whether the EEA  national  was  a  jobseeker,  wrongly
    importing into her considerations Regulation 6(2)(b),  which  refer  to
    workers and not 6(4) which merely states:

         "For the purpose of paragraph 1(a) jobseeker  means  a  person  who
         enters the UK in order to seek employment and can provide  evidence
         that he is seeking employment and has a  genuine  chance  of  being
         engaged."

14. The reference in the determination, taken from the refusal  letter,  to
    not being employed for more than six months and being registered  as  a
    jobseeker, refers to persons no longer working but not to jobseekers.

15. Accordingly the decision must be set aside.

16. Mr Diwnycz conceded that the Appellant as at today's date,  and  indeed
    as at the date before the judge, was self-employed.  The fact that  she
    made her application on the basis of being a jobseeker and not  on  the
    basis of self-employment does not mean that  she  is  not  entitled  to
    succeed in her appeal.  The refusal was on the basis that she  was  not
    thought to be a qualified person.  The fact that she  could  show  that
    she was a qualified person as at the date of the hearing, albeit upon a
    different basis, entitles her to succeed in the appeal.

17. An application under the EEA Regulations is  distinguishable  from  one
    under the Immigration Rules when an in-country applicant  has  to  show
    that he could meet the requirements of the Rules  as  at  the  date  of
    decision, albeit that he can adduce evidence up to the date of hearing.
     (EA (Section 85(4) explained) Nigeria [2007] UKAIT 00013).  The  focus
    is on the decision actually made in response to the application made.

18. In this case the decision was that the Appellant was not entitled to  a
    residence card.  The Presenting Officer now concedes that  she  was  so
    entitled.

Decision

19. The original judge erred in law.   Her  decision  is  set  aside.   The
    appeals are allowed.
