                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is an appeal against  a  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Turquet promulgated on 21 April 2015.  It concerns the appellant, Rajib
    Chandra Saha, born on 1 January 1980 and a citizen of Bangladesh.
2.   The appellant came to the United Kingdom in September 2007  with  entry
    clearance as a student valid until 31 December  2008.  He  was  granted
    further leave, first as a Tier 4 (General) Student and then as a Tier 1
    HS (Post-Study) Migrant lasting from 23 August  2011  until  23  August
    2014.  On 21 August 2014 the appellant made a combined application  for
    further leave to remain in the United Kingdom as  a  Tier  2  (General)
    Migrant and a biometric residence permit.  That application was refused
    on 19 September 2014 and a removal direction was made accordingly.

3.   The appeal against that refusal and the removal direction  came  before
    the First-tier Tribunal. The determination sets out that the  appellant
    had  been  offered  a  job  as  business  development  manager  of   an
    organisation known as "The From Boyhood to Manhood Foundation" carrying
    a gross salary of some ï¿½22,000 per annum.  This employment was  due  to
    commence in September 2014.  The sponsor issued the  appellant  with  a
    certificate of sponsorship (COS) in  order  that  he  could  apply  for
    further leave.

4.   What then happened, and what really lies at the heart of  this  appeal,
    is that while the appellant's  application  was  pending,  for  reasons
    which are unknown, the organisation  withdrew  its  COS.   Neither  the
    organisation - as  sponsor  -  nor  the  Home  Secretary  informed  the
    appellant of that withdrawal.  Although  it  does  not  appear  in  the
    determination (nor I understand in  the  underlying  documentation),  I
    have been told today by Ms Murshed,  and  it  does  not  appear  to  be
    disputed, that we are concerned  with  an  online  system  and  that  a
    sponsor can  at  any  time  effectively  'untick'  the  certificate  of
    sponsorship  box  thereby  withdrawing  the  COS.   This  can  be  done
    unilaterally and it does not trigger any form of automatic notification
    to an applicant.

5.   It appears that the appellant was taken  aback  when  informed  of  the
    decision to refuse his leave and to compel his  removal  because  until
    that moment he was not aware that the COS had  been  withdrawn  by  his
    sponsor.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  examined  the  points-based
    manner in which leave of this type is determined and came inevitably to
    the conclusion that in  the  absence  of  such  a  certificate  it  was
    impossible for this appellant to achieve the requisite score. There  is
    no appeal in relation to these factual matters which are undisputed.

6.    The  appellant's  complaint  is  that  the  system  operated  by   the
    respondent was itself procedurally unfair  both  as  a  matter  of  its
    general application  and  also  as  it  specifically  impacted  on  the
    appellant.  It was contended that what the Secretary  of  State  should
    have done was to have allowed further time within which  the  appellant
    could have explored finding an alternative COS.

7.   Reliance was placed on Thakur (PBS  decision  -  common  law  fairness)
    Bangladesh [2011] UKUT 00151 (IAC).  That is a decision of  Mr  Justice
    Simon sitting with Senior Immigration Judge Latter which deals with the
    question of Tier 4 (General) Student Migrants in receipt of sponsorship
    from an institution whose licence  is  withdrawn.  The  headnote  makes
    reference to:
         "a failure to comply with the common law duty to act fairly in  the
         decision making process when an applicant had not had  an  adequate
         opportunity  of  enrolling  at  another   college   following   the
         withdrawal  of  his  sponsor's  licence  or   of   making   further
         representations before the decision was made."

8.   In the judgment in Thakur, reference is  made  to  Home  Office  policy
    guidance issued in relation to this  type  of  'education'  case  which
    provides that where a Tier 4 sponsor licence is  withdrawn  the  normal
    position would be to allow a student already  studying  in  the  UK  60
    days' further leave if he or she was not involved with the reasons  why
    the licence was withdrawn. This affords the student the opportunity  of
    applying for permission to study with another Tier 4 sponsor.

9.   The judge made reference both to the case of Thakur  and  to  the  more
    recent case of Naved (Student - fairness -  notice  of  points)  [2012]
    UKUT 14.  The judge was not satisfied that a proper  analogy  could  be
    made between those education cases where a college is either closed  or
    its licence is withdrawn which then compels a batch of students to find
    alternative sponsorship certification.  The judge  was  satisfied  that
    the Secretary of State did not act unreasonably nor did she breach  the
    requirement for  procedural  fairness  in  not  giving  notice  to  the
    appellant that in his case the COS had been withdrawn.

10.  In my assessment the judge was correct not  to  analogise  between  the
    education cases and the workplace situation. Although in a strict sense
    both types of certificate are personal to the  individual  named,  they
    are very different in  type.   One  is  institutional,  relating  to  a
    specific place of education approved by way of a licence and the  other
    exists in  the  free  market  of  employment.   In  this  instance  the
    Secretary of State was in no way  complicit  in  the  decision  of  the
    sponsor to withdraw the job offer.  This was not, for example,  a  case
    of the Secretary of State intervening to close down  a  college  or  to
    take away its licence.

11.   The  Secretary  of  State  cannot   provide   for   each   conceivable
    circumstance. Employers are at liberty  to  withdraw  their  offers  of
    employment. It would be placing the duty too high for the Secretary  of
    State to have the level of individual engagement contended for  by  the
    appellant in cases of this type. The fact that the  withdrawal  of  the
    job offer may have  significant  ramifications  for  the  appellant  is
    regrettable but all that the Secretary of State can properly do  is  to
    deal with the application on the information available when the  matter
    is determined.  That information clearly indicated that  there  was  no
    COS in place because it had been withdrawn.  There  is  no  express  or
    implied obligation upon the Secretary of State to  bring  this  to  the
    appellant's attention or to afford him time to find a fresh COS.

12.  The evidence of what may or may not have  happened  had  the  appellant
    been notified of the withdrawal if the COS may be of  little  relevance
    and Ms Murshed  invited  me  to  disregard  it.  Paragraph  15  of  the
    determination states as follows:
         "I found the Appellant's evidence in  respect  of  his  prospective
         claimed employment unconvincing. He did not know  how  many  people
         were employed but said his job was to delegate the jobs between the
         employees. He knew it was a charity  but,  since  [presumably,  the
         refusal letter] he has made no enquiries about what has happened to
         the charity, although it is  no  longer  where  it  was.  The  only
         information he had seen from the Home Office website was  that  the
         charity was established."

    It seems that the judge had  certain  misgivings  concerning  both  the
    offer of employment and the status of  the  prospective  employer  and,
    despite hearing oral evidence from the appellant and  submissions  from
    his legal representative, those concerns were not allayed. Paragraph 15
    is not the subject of any ground of appeal.


13.  The appeal, as it was advanced in oral submissions before me,  was  put
    on the more expansive basis that the system which had been put in place
    and operated by the Secretary of  State  was  flawed  due  to  inherent
    procedural unfairness. It was said that the fact that a  sponsor  could
    at any time 'untick' a box on the online system thereby withdrawing its
    COS without notice to the applicant compromised the entire system. This
    argument was pursued with tenacity.

14.  Paragraph 9 of the Grounds of Appeal complains that the appellant  "was
    not given the slightest opportunity to challenge the withdrawal, or  to
    find a new sponsor or to vary his application". There was  no  material
    before the judge or before me to suggest  that  the  withdrawal  was  a
    mistake by the employer and any challenge would seem to  be  a  private
    matter between the appellant and the putative employer. As  was  argued
    by Ms Everett, it was through no fault of the Secretary of  State  that
    the offer of employment and/or the COS  were  not  in  place  when  the
    matter was determined. There is no policy guidance or other  indication
    from the Secretary  of  State  that  these  cases  are  to  be  treated
    similarly to the education cases. This is unsurprising as the scenarios
    are quite different. It was argued before me that in consequence of the
    refusal, the immigration status of the appellant changed thereby making
    it more difficult for him to secure an alternative COS from a different
    employer. Had he been notified of the withdrawal of the  COS  he  could
    have  withdrawn   his   application   thereby   avoiding   an   adverse
    determination. Even if this is correct, and on the  information  before
    me I can make no specific finding, I do not consider that it amounts to
    unfairness on the part of the Secretary  of  State.  Her  decision  was
    properly made irrespective of the  effect  it  may  have  had  on  this
    particular appellant.

15.  Reference was made to  R  (on  the  application  of  Q  and  others)  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2003] EWCA Civ 354 in which
    judgment the  well-known  passage   from  Lord  Mustill  in  R  v  Home
    Secretary ex parte Doody [1994] 1 AC 531 at 560 was cited.  I  note  in
    particular Lord Mustill's observation that "the principles of  fairness
    are not to be applied by rote  identically  in  every  situation.  What
    fairness demands is dependent on the context of the decision  and  this
    is to be taken into account in all its respects". I  am  not  persuaded
    that fairness required the Secretary of State to notify  the  appellant
    that his sponsor had withdrawn its  COS.  The  obligation  was  on  the
    appellant to make an application which was robust and sustainable  from
    the outset. Here the judge made a specific finding at paragraph  15  of
    the determination (which is not challenged in  this  appeal)  that  the
    appellant's evidence was unconvincing as to his prospective employment.



16.  The Secretary of State had  no  control  over  the  withdrawal  of  the
    appellant's job offer or COS; she came to a proper  conclusion  on  the
    material which was before her; and therefore  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge was correct in reaching the decision which he did. In the absence
    of any material error of law in the First-tier Tribunal, this appeal is
    dismissed.
