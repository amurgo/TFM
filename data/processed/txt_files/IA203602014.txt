                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appellant

1.   The Appellant is a citizen of Nigeria born on 28th December  1982.   He
    appealed against a decision of the Respondent dated 15th April 2014  to
    refuse his application for a  residence  card  as  an  extended  family
    member of a European Economic Area national exercising  treaty  rights.
    His appeal was allowed at first instance by  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Cope sitting at North  Shields  on  3rd  February  2015.   The
    Respondent appeals with leave against that decision.  For  the  reasons
    which I set out below at paragraph I have set the decision of the First-
    tier aside and remade the decision.  I therefore refer to  the  parties
    as they were known at first instance for the sake of convenience.

2.   The Appellant's case was that he was applying for a residence  card  as
    the extended family member of Ms Gintare  Gavrilcikaite  a  citizen  of
    Lithuania ("the Sponsor").  The Appellant came to the United Kingdom as
    a student in 2008 subsequently obtaining an MSc in Renewable Energy and
    Resource Management from the University of Glamorgan in November  2009.
    He has since been employed  with  that  university  and  various  other
    companies.  In November 2011 he  married  Oladunmi  Oluwakemi  Dada  in
    London.  That relationship later broke down and  the  couple  divorced,
    the decree nisi being pronounced on 21st May 2014.  In October 2012 the
    Appellant began a relationship with the Sponsor  and  in  January  2013
    moved into her property to live together from that time.   The  Sponsor
    works for the Pr�t A Manger sandwich chain as a  kitchen  leader.   The
    Appellant made his application for a residence card  on  10th  February
    2014 the refusal of which has given rise to the present proceedings. In
    a covering letter the Appellant's solicitors stated that the  Appellant
    was still married (to Ms Dada)  but  in  the  process  of  obtaining  a
    divorce.  The Sponsor's mother spoke little English but had sent  gifts
    to the Appellant from Lithuania.  The Appellant and  Sponsor  had  been
    residing together since January 2013 but the couple did  not  have  any
    documentary proof of this.

Relevant Law

3.    Regulation  8(5)  of  the   Immigration   (European   Economic   Area)
    Regulations 2006 ("the 2006 Regulations") provides that extended family
    members includes those  who  can  show  that  they  are  in  a  durable
    relationship with an EEA national.  The  burden  of  establishing  this
    rests upon the Appellant and the standard of proof is the  usual  civil
    standard of balance of probabilities.  Regulation  17(4)  of  the  2006
    Regulations provides that the Respondent may issue a residence card  to
    an extended family member if in all the circumstances it appears to the
    Respondent appropriate to issue the Residence Card.

Explanation for Refusal

4.   The Respondent expected the Appellant to be able  to  demonstrate  that
    he had been living together with the Sponsor for  at  least  two  years
    with an intention to permanently live together.  The Appellant had  not
    provided any documentation to suggest he was in a durable relationship.
     His solicitors had said that the Appellant and the  Sponsor  had  been
    residing  together  since  January  2013  but  accepted  there  was  no
    documentation to prove this.  The Appellant had provided a  Lloyds  TSB
    statement dated April/May 2013 addressed to the Sponsor  in  Hayes  and
    bank statements addressed to the Appellant in Abbey Wood.  That  showed
    that they did not live together.  The Respondent would  expect  to  see
    evidence of joint council tax bills, joint utility  bills,  joint  bank
    accounts and any other relevant documents.  Due to the lack of evidence
    the Respondent  could  not  accept  the  Appellant  was  in  a  durable
    relationship for the purposes of the 2006 Regulations and  refused  the
    application under Regulation 8(5).

The Decision at First Instance

5.   The Judge heard evidence from the Appellant and Sponsor  and  a  cousin
    of the Appellant which confirmed that the Appellant and Sponsor were in
    a stable and continuing relationship together.  The Judge was satisfied
    that this was so (paragraph 46 of the determination) as there  were  no
    major discrepancies between the witnesses.  At paragraph 47  the  Judge
    stated that the Appellant's solicitors had prepared  a  very  extensive
    bundle of documents for the hearing of this appeal  "I  have  read  and
    taken into consideration  all  of  this  documentation".   This  was  a
    reference to the bundle submitted at first instance which ran  to  some
    726 pages.

6.   The Judge placed particular reliance on the telephone records  produced
    for both the Appellant and Sponsor's mobile  telephones.   These  bills
    covered 2013 and 2014 and showed very regular usually several  times  a
    day contact between the Appellant and the Sponsor.  This was  a  strong
    indicator that they were in a relationship as claimed.   There  were  a
    considerable number of photographs of the Appellant and  Sponsor  which
    it was apparent had been taken  on  a  number  of  different  occasions
    indicating that the couple had had considerable contact with each other
    over a period of time.  It was more likely than not that the  Appellant
    and Sponsor were in a  durable  relationship  and  had  been  so  since
    October 2012 when their relationship began and January 2013  when  they
    started living together.  There were no minimum financial  requirements
    under the 2006 Regulations as to the amount of money the Sponsor should
    earn which in fact was approximately �5,000 less than would be required
    under Appendix FM.

7.   Directing himself as to the correct three stage approach  to  assessing
    such a case as this the Judge  cited  YB  (Ivory  Coast)  [2008]  UKAIT
    00062.   Firstly  decide  whether  the  Appellant  was  in  a   durable
    relationship, secondly have regard  to  comparable  provisions  of  the
    Immigration Rules but not in a determinative way and thirdly carry  out
    an extensive examination of the personal circumstances of the Appellant
    when deciding whether discretion should be exercised  and  a  residence
    card issued.  This last point was taken by the Judge to  mean  that  he
    had the power to exercise his own discretion (whether or not  to  issue
    the card) which might differ from the discretionary approach  taken  by
    the Respondent under Regulation 17(4).

8.   The Respondent should have conducted an extensive  examination  of  the
    Appellant's personal circumstances.  On the basis of  the  evidence  it
    was appropriate for a residence card to be issued to the  Appellant  as
    the relationship of the Appellant and Sponsor was a durable  one.   The
    refusal was only on the basis that the Respondent did not consider that
    the parties were in a durable relationship,  had  the  Respondent  been
    satisfied that the relationship was durable she  would  have  issued  a
    residence card.  The Judge allowed the appeal.



The Onward Appeal

9.    The  Respondent  appealed  against  this  decision  arguing  that  the
    determination made findings without giving adequate reasons  for  doing
    so.  No documentary  evidence  had  been  produced  to  show  that  the
    Appellant and  Sponsor  had  been  cohabiting  since  January  2013  as
    claimed.  Secondly it was  not  open  to  the  Judge  to  consider  the
    exercise of discretion under Regulation 17(4) in  the  absence  of  the
    Respondent first doing so.  The Respondent relied on the  cases  of  FD
    [2007] UKAIT 49 and Ihemedu [2011] UKUT 00340.  As the  Respondent  was
    not satisfied that the Appellant was an extended family member  of  the
    Sponsor she did not proceed to the second stage of deciding whether  to
    exercise discretion  in  the  Appellant's  favour  by  granting  him  a
    residence card.  In such circumstances the  Judge  was  constrained  to
    allow the appeal on the basis that the Respondent's decision was not in
    accordance with the law rather than allow it outright.

10.  The application for permission to appeal  came  on  the  papers  before
    First-tier Tribunal Judge De Haney  on  8th  June  2015.   In  refusing
    permission to appeal he wrote that the Respondent's grounds  of  appeal
    were nothing more than a disagreement with the findings of  the  Judge.
    The Judge had made detailed findings  on  the  considerable  amount  of
    documentary evidence relied upon by the Appellant.  The Judge had  also
    dealt with the jurisdictional issues  raised  and  concluded  that  the
    circumstances of the appeal were such that he had jurisdiction to allow
    the appeal outright rather than "remitting" it back to the Respondent.

11.  The Respondent renewed her application for permission to appeal to  the
    Upper Tribunal, this time quoting from the  headnote  of  Ihemedu  that
    Regulation 17(4) made the issue of a  residence  card  to  an  extended
    family member a matter of discretion.  Where  the  Respondent  had  not
    exercised that discretion the most an Immigration Judge was entitled to
    do was to allow the appeal as being not  in  accordance  with  the  law
    leaving the matter of whether to exercise discretion in the Appellant's
    favour or not to the Respondent.

12.  The renewed application for permission  to  appeal  came  before  Upper
    Tribunal Judge Lane on 4th August  2015.   In  granting  permission  to
    appeal he wrote:

         "It  is  arguable  that  the  Respondent  had  not  exercised   any
         discretion as regards the issue of a residence card  and  that  the
         Judge erred in law by allowing the appeal  outright.   It  is  also
         arguable that in an appeal  where  the  evidence  produced  by  the
         Appellant had not been accepted by the Respondent  as  proving  the
         existence of a durable  relationship,  the  Judge's  reasoning  was
         insufficient."

The Hearing before Me

13.  At the hearing before me it was conceded on the part of  the  Appellant
    that  the  Judge  was  wrong  in  law  to  consider  that  he  had  the
    jurisdiction to exercise his discretion in place of  the  Respondent's.
    For the  Respondent  it  was  argued  that  it  was  not  fatal  to  an
    application for a residence card by an extended family member  that  he
    and the qualifying person had not lived together for two years  but  in
    this case the Judge had misunderstood the  ratio  in  YB.   Immigration
    Rules were a rule of thumb guide as to what constituted durability  but
    they should not discriminate against  United  Kingdom  nationals.   The
    Judge had fallen into error at paragraph 56 of the  determination  when
    saying that the parties  had  been  in  a  durable  relationship  since
    October 2012 when the relationship began.  What the  Respondent  should
    be able to do when reading an adverse decision was to discover why  the
    Judge had found the parties were living together when that evidence had
    been challenged.  The losing party should know why they had lost.

14.  In response Counsel for the Appellant argued  that  the  permission  to
    appeal decision did not say why the determination at first instance was
    unreasoned. The Respondent's grounds had not challenged the findings as
    such.  All the Respondent had said in the refusal letter was that there
    were two sets of documents provided for two different addresses.   That
    was why the bundle that was produced for the  First-tier  Tribunal  had
    726 pages.  There was a stark contrast between  what  was  put  to  the
    Respondent with the application and what was put to the Judge with  the
    appeal.  The Judge placed weight on  the  telephone  records  which  he
    discussed in the determination.  This was important because there  were
    two years' worth of mobile telephone bills.

15.  There was evidence of cohabitation but the  gap  in  the  evidence  was
    explained by the Appellant at paragraph 4 of his statement that he  had
    not changed his address for statements and letters  whilst  the  couple
    were looking for a suitable property for them both  to  move  to.   The
    Sponsor had been given permission for the Appellant to reside with  her
    so the parties had not considered it necessary to put the Appellant  on
    the tenancy agreement as that would be a short term arrangement.  There
    were statements from other tenants who used to reside with the parties.
     The Judge had tested  the  evidence  of  each  witness  and  found  it
    reliable.  There was no  timescale  for  length  of  cohabitation  that
    needed to be shown.  The Judge had found that the  parties  were  in  a
    lasting relationship.  Both parties had been given the  opportunity  to
    address the Judge on the ratio in YB.  The two year period referred  to
    in the refusal letter was not contained in the underlying EU Directive.

16.   In  response  the  Presenting  Officer  argued  that  the  Judge   had
    misunderstood YB in public law terms.  There was a requirement for  the
    Judge to make reasoned findings.  Cohabitation had been  very  much  in
    dispute at the hearing.  Paragraph 56 of the determination  (where  the
    Judge had found on the balance of probabilities that the Appellant  and
    Sponsor were in a durable relationship) was not sufficiently  reasoned.
    Cohabitation was essential.   If  the  Judge  had  said  that  was  not
    required that would be discriminatory against UK  citizens  since  they
    did have to prove that.  All there  was  evidence  of  was  one  year's
    shared cohabitation.  The Judge had found that  the  parties  had  been
    living together since 2013 but even the Appellant's  own  evidence  did
    not support that finding.  It was not enough to say  that  they  called
    each other on the telephone or that  there  were  photographs  of  them
    together.  The Judge had to look at the substantive point.

17.   Finally  in  closing  Counsel  submitted  that  the  reason  for  non-
    discrimination was so that European Economic  Area  citizens  were  not
    treated less favourably than citizens of a  Member  State.   There  was
    nothing  in  the  directions  or   the   Regulations   which   required
    cohabitation.  A requirement of cohabitation would discriminate against
    EU citizens.  If an error of law was found the matter  should  be  sent
    back to the Respondent to be looked at again.

Findings

18.  There are two separate issues in this case.  The first is  whether  the
    Judge gave adequate reasons for his  finding  that  the  Appellant  and
    Sponsor were in a durable relationship.  The second issue is whether in
    the light of the Respondent's refusal to issue a residence card  as  an
    extended family member under Regulation 8, the Judge was entitled to go
    ahead and allow the appeal outright.

19.  The Respondent had refused the  application  because  of  the  lack  of
    evidence  (particularly  documents)  showing  that  the  Appellant  and
    Sponsor had lived together.  There was a frank admission of this in the
    covering letter and it is not surprising in the light of that that  the
    Respondent should have approached the Appellant's application with some
    caution.  To make up for the confusion caused by that  covering  letter
    the Appellant's solicitors went to the opposite extreme when the matter
    came before the Judge at first instance by preparing a bundle which was
    far in excess of what was needed for  a  proper  determination  of  the
    case.  At 726 pages the bundle was unwieldy and unhelpful containing as
    it did the danger that there might be some important document in such a
    large bundle which could easily be overlooked with adverse consequences
    for the proper disposal of the appeal.

20.  The Appellant's case at first instance was not  an  admission  that  he
    and the Sponsor did not live together rather it was an acceptance  that
    there were gaps in the documentation to  prove  that  at  all  relevant
    times the Appellant and Sponsor had lived together.  That was a  matter
    for the Judge to decide having  heard  the  witnesses  and  the  cross-
    examination and considered (to the extent that he was  able  given  the
    unwieldy nature of the bundle) the documentary evidence.  I would agree
    with Judge De Haney's characterisation of the grounds of onward  appeal
    that  in  relation  to  the  Judge's  findings  as  to  durability   of
    relationship, the grounds of onward appeal were a mere disagreement.

21.  Another Judge might have been persuaded differently  that  the  absence
    of documentary evidence was such (particularly if the  explanation  for
    that absence was not accepted) that the parties could  not  demonstrate
    that they were in a durable  relationship.   I  would  agree  with  the
    Respondent's  submissions  that  the  mere  existence   of   voluminous
    telephone records would not of themselves establish  that  the  parties
    were in a durable relationship. There might be  many  reasons  why  two
    parties telephoned each other regularly but such calls  would  tend  to
    confirm that the parties were not living together since  if  they  were
    they could speak to each other rather  more  directly.   Similarly  the
    photographs cannot prove cohabitation.  What is normally persuasive  is
    some form of paper trail establishing cohabitation whether it would  be
    shared utility bills or bank statements etc. sent to the  same  address
    for both parties.  That documentation was not obviously  to  hand.  The
    question would be whether such an absence  was  thereby  fatal  to  the
    appeal. Could the Judge rely on oral evidence  that  the  parties  were
    living together in the absence of documents? I remind myself  that  the
    Judge had the benefit of seeing the witnesses  give  evidence  which  I
    have not had.  The witnesses were cross-examined.  The Judge was  aware
    that he had to find that the relationship had been in existence  for  a
    substantial period of time to be able to conclude that it was a durable
    relationship  within  Regulation   8   (see   paragraph   31   of   the
    determination).

22.  Further the Judge reminded himself that the decision in this  case  was
    on the balance of probabilities and it was a matter for him whether  he
    accepted the explanation he was given for the absence of documentation.
     If the position had been that the absence of documentation  of  itself
    invalidated the appeal then he would have been in error in allowing it.
     I do not consider that the Judge's reasoning  for  finding  a  durable
    relationship was inadequate.  What is clear from the  Judge's  analysis
    of the evidence, paragraphs 45 to 56, is that the Judge was looking  at
    the evidence in the round.  The evidence established the  existence  of
    the relationship even if it did not necessarily establish the existence
    of cohabitation.  I find no error  of  law  therefore  in  the  Judge's
    finding that the parties were in a durable relationship.

23.  This means I move to the second issue which is whether  the  Judge  was
    entitled to allow the appeal outright.  Paragraph 1 of the headnote  to
    YB  states  that  neither  the  Citizens'  Directive  (2004/38/EC)  nor
    Regulation 17(4) of the 2006  Regulations  confers  on  another  family
    member or extended family member of an EEA national  exercising  treaty
    rights a right to a residence card (my emphasis).  Regulation 17(4) was
    consistent with the Citizens'  Directive  in  making  the  grant  of  a
    residence card  to  an  extended  family  member  discretionary.   This
    reasoning was amplified in more detail at paragraph 22 of YB where  the
    Upper Tribunal had looked at the directive  specifically  Article  3(2)
    which in the words of the Upper Tribunal

         "... clearly permits Member States to decide  the  cases  of  other
         family members in accordance with national law and there is nothing
         in community law which prevents the United Kingdom  from  providing
         in Regulation 17(4)(b) that the issue of a residence card for  such
         persons is a matter for discretion".

    At paragraph 23 the Upper Tribunal indicated that national law must not
    seek to define terms which were community law  terms  such  as  durable
    relationship.

24.  The Judge fell into error  in  considering  that  he  was  entitled  to
    exercise his discretion in a case where the Respondent  had  discretion
    but had not exercised it.  The point was conceded by  Counsel  for  the
    Appellant, in my view rightly so.  Having found that the  parties  were
    in a durable relationship the Judge should at that point have found the
    Respondent's decision to be not in accordance with the law such that it
    remained outstanding before the Respondent to take  a  valid  decision.
    The Judge did not do that and thereby made a  material  error  of  law.
    Accordingly I set aside the Judge's decision and remake it by  allowing
    the Respondent's appeal to the limited extent that the decision remains
    outstanding before the Respondent.  However in arriving at her  further
    decision in this matter and exercising her discretion under  Regulation
    17(4) the Respondent must take into account the findings of  the  Judge
    at first instance that the relationship between the Appellant  and  the
    Sponsor is a durable one.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an  error  of
law and I have set it aside.  I have remade the  decision  by  allowing  the
Appellant's appeal against the Respondent's decision to refuse  to  issue  a
residence card to the extent that the decision  remains  outstanding  before
the Respondent to take a valid decision.

Appellant's appeal allowed (but to the limited extent stated).

I make no anonymity order as there no public policy reason for so doing.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

The Judge made a fee award  of  �140  because  he  allowed  the  Appellant's
appeal.  It is clear from the determination and the very large  bundle  that
was submitted after the Respondent's decision that the  appeal  was  allowed
on the basis of evidence not before  the  Respondent  at  the  time  of  the
decision.  In those circumstances and also given the fact that  I  have  set
aside the First-tier Tribunal's decision, I set aside the fee award so  that
no fee is payable.
