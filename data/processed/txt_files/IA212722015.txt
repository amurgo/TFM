Representation:

For the Appellant:     In person
For the Respondent:    Mr P Duffy, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant, a citizen  of  Mauritius  aged  25,  has  permission  to
    challenge the decision of First-tier Tribunal (FtT) Judge Watt sent  on
    14 October 2016 dismissing his appeal against a decision  made  by  the
    respondent on 21 May  2015  refusing  further  leave  to  remain  under
    Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.  The  basis  of  the  appellant's
    written  grounds  was  that  the  judge  had  failed  to  give   proper
    consideration to that issue and to the issue of whether the  respondent
    was right to refuse his Article 8 case outside the Immigration Rules.

2.   The appellant appeared before  me  unrepresented.   She  confirmed  she
    wished to proceed with the  hearing.   I  explained  that  as  she  was
    unrepresented I would do my best to ensure she had full opportunity  to
    put her case.  I explained that I was concerned solely  at  this  stage
    with whether the FtT judge had got it wrong in law.  Her husband was in
    attendance and I permitted him to sit next to her to lend advice if she
    needed it.  Mr Duffy agreed to make his submissions first.  In short he
    submitted that the judge properly considered the appellant's case  both
    under the relevant Immigration Rules and outside  the  Rules.   In  the
    nature of the requirements of the Rules  relevant  in  this  case,  the
    judge's reasons for  concluding  the  appellant  could  not  meet  them
    doubled as a reason  why  the  appellant  failed  to  show  exceptional
    circumstances outside the Rules.   In  her  submissions  the  appellant
    highlighted the fact that the judge  had  accepted  that  she  and  her
    husband were in a genuine and subsisting relationship and that it would
    not be proportionate to expect  her  husband  to  return  with  her  to
    Mauritius or alternatively for the couple to maintain communication  by
    other means.  She  produced  a  letter  from  her  cousin,  Mr  Toofail
    certifying that he provided financial support to her and  a  letter  of
    employment relating to her husband having started work as an  Assistant
    Chef on 29 July  2017.   She  emphasised  that  her  husband  (who  had
    suffered from health problems including severe depression) was  getting
    better.  The judge was wrong, she submitted, to refuse the  appellant's
    application for purely financial reasons.

3.   Like the FtT judge I have some  sympathy  for  the  appellant  and  her
    husband who have experienced financial difficulties because she is  not
    permitted to work and he has had health issues.  However, I can discern
    no error of law in the judge's decision.  The respondent had decided to
    refuse the appellant's application for leave to remain  under  Appendix
    FM for two main reasons: first because she was not satisfied they  were
    in a genuine and subsisting relationship as required by E-LTRP.1.10 and
    second because neither she nor her spouse worked, and  therefore  could
    not provide evidence of earning a specified gross annual income  of  at
    least �18,600 as required by E-LTRP.3.1.  The respondent also concluded
    that the appellant could not succeed under paragraph 276ADE(1)  as  she
    had not shown there would be very  significant  obstacles  to  her  re-
    integration back into Mauritian society, in which  she  had  mixed  and
    lived up until April 2011.  The  respondent  also  concluded  that  the
    appellant had  not  shown  there  were  any  exceptional  circumstances
    consistent with her right to respect for family and private life.

4.   At the hearing the judge heard from the appellant and her husband.   In
    contrast to the respondent, the judge was satisfied the couple were  in
    a genuine and subsisting relationship and  that  they  married  because
    they both wanted to, not to achieve any immigration  status  (paragraph
    16).  However, like the respondent he was not satisfied  the  appellant
    could meet the requirements of the Rules.

5.   The judge was unarguably right to conclude  that  the  appellant  could
    not meet the requirements of the Rules.  The failure of  the  appellant
    to meet the financial requirements of the Rules was  manifest:  at  the
    date of the hearing she had no income through employment; she  survived
    on �300 per month  from  her  uncle  plus  the  appellant's  employment
    support allowance.  Her husband was not in work and was in  receipt  of
    unemployment support allowance.

6.   I take note of the evidence produced by the appellant  at  the  hearing
    before me showing her husband has now got a job, but this was  not  the
    state of affairs when the case came before the judge and he  cannot  be
    said to have erred in law in failing to take into account of a fact not
    then in existence and whose existence was not reasonably foreseeable.

7.   At paragraphs 17 and 18 the judge stated:

         "17. In regard to the ten year route under Appendix FM,  there  was
             no evidence put before me to show any insurmountable obstacles
             to family life with the appellant's partner continuing outside
             the UK and therefore I consider that the respondent's decision
             under Appendix FM is correct.


         18.  In regard to  paragraph  276ADE  I  have  to  agree  with  the
             decision of the  respondent  that  there  would  not  be  very
             significant obstacles  to  the  appellant's  integration  into
             Mauritius if she were returned there.  She is  a  national  of
             maintenance and lived there for nineteen years, spent all  her
             formative years in that country and has provided  no  evidence
             to show any problems with reintegration into Mauritius."

8.   I consider these findings are free of  legal  error.  It  was  entirely
    within the range of reasonable responses for the judge to find that the
    appellant had failed to show that there would be either  insurmountable
    obstacles or very significant obstacles to the  couple  resuming  their
    family life in Mauritius.

9.   It is also clear that the judge  gave  separate  consideration  to  the
    issue of whether there were any special  or  exceptional  circumstances
    justifying a grant of leave outside the Rules.   At  paragraph  19  the
    judge wrote:

         "19. In regard to considering special circumstances or  exceptional
             circumstances for why  the  application  could  be  considered
             under Article 8 outwith the Rules, I do not consider there are
             any special circumstances in this case.  As pointed out by the
             Home Office, if Mr Aransivia does not travel to Mauritius with
             his wife then he could continue to keep in touch with her  via
             e-mail, telephone or internet.   However,  I  agree  that  any
             infringement of his Article 8 rights in such an instance would
             be  justified  and  proportionate  in  the  pursuit   of   the
             maintenance of an effective immigration control."


10.  Whilst this paragraph is brief, I agree with Mr Duffy that  it  has  to
    be read in  the  light  of  the  judge's  preceding  findings  of  fact
    regarding the fact that the appellant's history showed  she  would  not
    have problems  reintegrating  in  Mauritian  society.   The  identified
    health problems of her husband were not such as gave any  valid  reason
    to consider he would not be  able  to  receive  adequate  treatment  in
    Mauritius for his problems.  Quite properly the judge  also  considered
    what the situation would be if the husband, who is a  British  citizen,
    chose to remain in the UK.  Given that such a decision would amount  to
    a choice rather than a response to any  insurmountable  obstacles,  the
    judge was entitled to consider it proportionate to expect the couple to
    keep in touch by indirect means for so long as he continued  to  choose
    not to go and live with her in Mauritius.  It must  also  be  borne  in
    mind that the appellant has  the  option,  if  and  when  the  couple's
    financial  circumstances  improve  sufficiently,  to  apply  for  entry
    clearance as a spouse and their circumstances will have to take account
    of the latest guidance from the Supreme  Court  in  the  R(MM)  Lebanon
    [2017] UKSC 10  case on this issue.

Notice of Decision

11.  For the above reasons I conclude that the judge did not materially  err
    in law and accordingly her decision to dismiss the  appellant's  appeal
    is upheld.

12.  No anonymity direction is made.
