For the Appellant:       Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer

For the Respondent:      Mr C H Ndubuisi, of Drummond Miller, Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1) We refer to parties as they were in the First-tier Tribunal.

2) The appellant is a citizen of Iraq, born on 13  April  1964.   By  notice
   dated 30 April 2012 the respondent  refused  her  application  for  entry
   clearance as a spouse for settlement in the UK.  The  appellant  did  not
   provide the original English language test certificate  required  by  the
   Immigration Rules HC395,  as  amended.   The  financial  aspects  of  her
   application  were  also  doubted.   The  decision  was  thought   to   be
   proportionate in terms of Article 8 of the ECHR.

3)  In  his  determination,  promulgated  on  1  February  2013,  First-tier
   Tribunal  Judge  D'Ambrosio  found   in   the   appellant's   favour   on
   accommodation and maintenance under the Rules, but  that  she  failed  to
   produce  the  required  certificate  of  English  language  ability.   He
   dismissed the appeal under the Rules, and allowed it under Article  8  of
   the ECHR.

4) These are the SSHD's grounds of appeal to the Upper Tribunal:

     i) The appellant failed to provide evidence  of  an  accepted  English
        language test.  The option of resitting this test ... is still open
        to her.  The judge erred ... by finding at paragraph 21 ... that if
        the Article 8 claim fails the appellant would have no other  lawful
        right to enter the UK, this contradicts  the  judge's  findings  at
        paragraph 126 ... that she can  apply  for  entry  clearance  as  a
        family visitor and at paragraph 127 [that she can] submit  a  fresh
        application [as a spouse].


    ii) The sponsor is in receipt of disability benefits ... this does  not
        prevent him from supporting an application for entry clearance even
        if under the new Rules the requirements ... are more rigorous.  The
        judge finds that  it  would  take  the  appellant  years  to  raise
        sufficient funds ... given his findings ...  that  the  appellant's
        claimed savings are credible, despite the Entry Clearance Officer's
        concerns ... the judge's findings contradict themselves ...

   iii) ... The judge's findings with regard to ... Article 8 ...  seek  to
        excuse the appellant from seeking entry  clearance  under  the  new
        Rules, post 9 July 2012.  In the light of the  judge's  flawed  and
        contradictory findings set out above, this  infected  his  findings
        under the Rules and in assessing proportionality ...  in  Miah  and
        Others [2012] EWCA Civ 261 ... Stanley Burnton LJ said at paragraph
        26  "...  there  is  no  near  miss  principle  applicable  to  the
        Immigration Rules.  The Secretary  of  State,  and  on  appeal  the
        Tribunal, must assess the strength of an Article 8 claim,  but  the
        requirements of immigration control are not weakened by the  degree
        of non-compliance with the Immigration Rules."


5) On 25 February 2013, Designated First-tier Tribunal Judge Shaerf  granted
   permission to appeal, on the view that the judge's findings were  perhaps
   contradictory and unclear:

      A consequence is that his treatment of the Article 8 claim appears  at
      least in substantial parts to be no more than an argument to support a
      "near  miss"  claim  ...  which  together  with  the   unresolved   or
      contradictory issues ... makes it  arguable  that  the  assessment  of
      proportionality is [unsafe].

6) It does not appear that either representative acquainted  the  First-tier
   Tribunal Judge with the terms of the "new Rules" applicable to this case,
   and nor did he look them up.  Mr Matthews referred us to the following:

       Appendix FM family members
       Family life with a Partner
       Section EC-P: Entry clearance as a partner
       ....
       Financial requirements
       E-ECP.3.1. The applicant must provide specified evidence, from the
       sources listed in paragraph E-ECP.3.2., of-
       (a) a specified gross annual income of at least-
       (i) �18,600;
       (ii) an additional �3,800 for the first child; and
       (iii) an additional �2,400 for each additional child; alone or in
       combination with
       (b) specified savings of-
       (i) �16,000; and
       (ii) additional savings of an amount equivalent to 2.5 times the
       amount which is the difference between the gross annual income from
       the sources listed in paragraph E-ECP.3.2.(a)-(d) and the total
       amount required under paragraph E-ECP.3.1.(a); or
       (c) the requirements in paragraph E-ECP.3.3.being met.
       ....
       E-ECP.3.2. When determining whether the financial requirement in
       paragraph EECP 3.1. is met only the following sources will be taken
       into account-
       (a) income of the partner from specified employment or self-
       employment, which, in respect of a partner returning to the UK with
       the applicant, can include specified employment or self-employment
       overseas and in the UK;
       (b) specified pension income of the applicant and partner;
       (c) any specified maternity allowance or bereavement benefit
       received by the partner in the UK;
       (d) other specified income of the applicant and partner; and
       (e) specified savings of the applicant and partner.
       E-ECP.3.3. The requirements to be met under this paragraph are-
       (a) the applicant's partner must be receiving one or more of the
       following -
       (i) disability living allowance;
       (ii) severe disablement allowance;
       (iii) industrial injury disablement benefit;
       (iv) attendance allowance;
       (v) carer's allowance; or
       (vi) personal independence payment; and
       (b) the applicant must provide evidence that their partner is able
       to maintain and accommodate themselves, the applicant and any
       dependants adequately in the UK without recourse to public funds.

7) Mr Matthews submitted as follows.   The  relevant  requirements  in  this
   case are set out at E-ECP3.3.   They  do  not  impose  fixed  income  and
   capital  limits.   The  sponsor  is  in  receipt  of  Disability   Living
   Allowance.   Judge  D'Ambrosio  says  at  paragraph  112  that  any   new
   application would be subject to  "far  more  onerous  [requirements]  for
   savings/income" and at  paragraph  129  that  the  new  Rules  are  "more
   rigorous ... particularly as regards  the  amount  of  funds  needed  for
   adequate maintenance".  Those comments are wrong.  The "new Rules"  in  a
   case such as this  are  essentially  the  same  as  the  "old  Rules"  on
   accommodation and maintenance.  The judge's main reason for  deciding  as
   he did cannot stand.  The rest of the judge's reasoning on Article  8  is
   no more than allowing the appellant to succeed  because  her  application
   resulted in a "near miss", contrary to principle.  On the  evidence,  and
   on those findings which were correctly  made,  the  appellant  should  be
   expected to obtain the  correct  English  qualification  (not  difficult,
   given her level of education) and apply again.

8) Mr Ndubuisi firstly sought to persuade us that the appellant is not  only
   subject to E-ECP3.3 but also to the specified limits required in E-ECP3.1
   and 3.2.

9) That misreads the Rules.  E-ECP3.1  (c)  provides  that  E-ECP3.3  is  an
   alternative to E-ECP3.1 and 3.2.

10) Mr Ndubuisi further submitted that the judge set out all the factors  to
   be taken  into  account  on  the  respondent's  side,  in  particular  at
   paragraphs 122-127, and all those in favour of the appellant, at 128-136,
   and was entitled to decide as he did.

11) We asked Mr Ndubuisi  to  deal  with  paragraph  132,  where  the  judge
   specifically says that the appeal failed under the Rules only because the
   appellant failed to prove that her application met one of the two English
   test requirements, having followed erroneous advice given to her in Iraq,
   for which she could not be blamed.  Mr Ndubuisi argued that this did  not
   disclose a "near miss" approach  but  was  simply  taking  account  of  a
   relevant fact, and that although the judge had not considered  Miah,  nor
   the principle it contained, he reached his conclusion based on an overall
   proportionality assessment.

12) We reserved our determination.

13) The judge adopted without examination the submission for  the  appellant
   that the "new Rules" would be significantly more onerous on her than  the
   old.

14) The Secretary of State is entitled to make  Immigration  Rules,  and  to
   change these from time to time.  It is doubtful whether an  appeal  could
   properly succeed under Article 8 because it would be more  difficult  for
   an  appellant  to  meet  the  requirements  of  the  Rules  in  a  future
   application.

15) It is also doubtful whether  an  appeal  could  properly  succeed  under
   Article  8  when  an  appellant  has  the  option  of  making  a  further
   application, supported by the proper evidence, which may  enable  her  to
   succeed under the Rules.  If an appellant is in a position to  make  such
   an  application,  it  is  difficult  to  see   that   it   could   be   a
   disproportionate interference with her rights to private and family  life
   to expect her to do so.

16) Although the judge rehearsed the circumstances at great  length,  it  is
   plain that he allowed the appeal on the view that  the  appellant  failed
   only on a strict technical requirement, amounting to  a  near  miss,  for
   which she should be excused.

17) It may be that the amended Rules will make a  difference  in  this  case
   with  regards  to  maintenance.   However,  unless  and  until  a   valid
   application is made to the ECO and assessed under the rules, it  is  hard
   to see how it might be held as disproportionate  to  refuse  entry  under
   Article 8.

18) The judge was wrong to consider (a) that a near miss  might  be  a  good
   basis for allowing the appeal; (b) that the requirements of the Rules, as
   amended, were necessarily a major barrier to a further  application;  (c)
   that Article 8 might exempt a person from having to comply  with  amended
   requirements of the Immigration Rules;  and  (d)  that  Article  8  might
   generally exempt a person from  having  to  put  forward  an  application
   complying with the Rules, when she should in the near future  be  capable
   of doing so.  These are matters so fundamentally fatal to the appellant's
   case under Article 8 that the decision requires to be reversed.

19) The  determination  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  is  set  aside.   The
   following decision is substituted: the appeal, as originally  brought  to
   the First-tier Tribunal, is dismissed both under  the  Immigration  Rules
   and under Article 8 of the ECHR.

20) No anonymity order has been requested or made.
