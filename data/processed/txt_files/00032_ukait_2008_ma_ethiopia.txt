                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

In any case of disputed nationality the  first  question  to  be  considered
should be: "Is the person de jure a national  of  the  country  concerned?".
This question is to be answered by examining whether the person fulfils  the
nationality law requirements of his or her  country.  Matters  such  as  the
text of nationality  laws,  expert  evidence,  relevant  documentation,  the
appellant's own testimony, agreement between the parties and Foreign  Office
letters may all legitimately inform the assessment. In deciding  the  answer
to be given, it may be relevant to examine evidence of what the  authorities
in the appellant's country of origin have done in  respect  of  his  or  her
nationality.


If it is concluded that the person is de jure  a  national  of  the  country
concerned, then the next question to be considered is purely  factual,  i.e.
"Is it reasonably likely that the authorities of the  state  concerned  will
accept the person, if returned, as one of its own nationals?".


This decision replaces MA (Ethiopia - mixed ethnicity  -  dual  nationality)
Eritrea [2004] UKIAT 00324

1.   The appellant was born in Ethiopia to parents  of  Eritrean  ethnicity.
    The question of her nationality has been a matter of  some  uncertainty
    and difficulty throughout the time she has been in the United  Kingdom:
    we shall deal with the specifics later in this determination.

2.   She arrived in the United Kingdom on 24 March 1999 and  claimed  asylum
    on arrival.  Her application was refused in a decision of 4  July  2001
    refusing leave to enter.  At that time  removal  directions  associated
    with that decision were for Eritrea.

3.   The appellant appealed against that decision to an Adjudicator, Dr M  S
    W Hoyle, who heard her appeal on 4  March  2002.   He  noted  that  the
    essential account given by her to the Immigration Officer was that  she
    was married and was born in Addis  Ababa  and  was  a  Muslim  and  her
    current nationality was Eritrean.  In further detail to the Home Office
    she said that she feared return to Ethiopia and Eritrea.  She  and  her
    husband were of Eritrean nationality but had been living  in  Ethiopia.
    She said that her husband was a member of the Eritrean Liberation Front
    (ELF) and as a result was  deported  from  Ethiopia  to  Eritrea.   She
    herself was not then deported because she was at the time in Dire  Dawa
    where she had gone to give birth in February 1999.  She feared that  if
    she went to Eritrea she would, like her husband, be jailed  because  of
    his ELF membership.  If she went back to Ethiopia she would be deported
    to Eritrea.  When she had gone  from  Dire  Dawa  to  Addis  Ababa  her
    neighbours told her the authorities were looking for her to deport  her
    to Eritrea.

4.   The appellant in a witness statement before the Adjudicator  said  that
    her parents had come to Ethiopia from Eritrea before  her  birth.   She
    had never lived in  Eritrea.   Her  main  language  was  Amharic.   She
    understood some Tigrinya, the language spoken in Eritrea, but  did  not
    speak it herself, and was easily identifiable as someone  from  central
    Ethiopia or Addis Ababa.

5.   She said that she had  never  considered  herself  to  be  an  Eritrean
    national as opposed to someone of Eritrean ethnic  origin  resident  in
    Ethiopia and Ethiopian by nationality.  She had never been issued  with
    any ID card, passport or any other  documents  by  the  authorities  of
    independent Eritrea, nor had she contributed money to related causes or
    taken part  in  community  activities  in  Addis  Ababa  supportive  of
    independent Eritrea.  She confirmed to the Adjudicator that she had  an
    Ethiopian passport.  When she was asked about nationality she said that
    the answer she gave to the Immigration Officer in  the  United  Kingdom
    was that she was of Eritrean origin.  The  Adjudicator  commented  that
    she gave him the impression in the way that she answered  the  question
    that she did not understand that she had had her nationality  noted  as
    Eritrean.  In cross-examination she  acknowledged  that  she  had  left
    Ethiopia with a valid Ethiopian passport in her name and had used it to
    gain access to Kenya.  She had not claimed asylum in Kenya because  the
    person with her had told her he would take her to a  safe  place.   She
    had not known she was going to the United Kingdom.  She had  last  seen
    her Ethiopian passport when she gave it to the person  who  had  helped
    her.  He had left her at immigration in England and did not come back.

6.   The Adjudicator considered her  claim  in  the  context  of  return  to
    Eritrea.  He found that on the evidence before him  the  appellant  was
    entitled to  Eritrean  nationality.   He  did  not  consider  that  the
    appellant would face a real risk of persecution or breach of Article  3
    on return to Eritrea.  Her husband had not told her he was in  the  ELF
    and there was no evidence that he was nor, if he were, at what level he
    was in that organisation.   Background  material  did  not  support  an
    assertion that ELF members per se would face a real risk of persecution
    or breach of Article 3 on return or that  unmarried  partners  of  such
    people would face such a risk either.  The Adjudicator noted  that  the
    appellant had held a validly issued Ethiopian  passport  on  which  she
    travelled out of her country of residence through Kenya to  the  United
    Kingdom.  He considered that the background material  did  not  support
    the assertion that an Ethiopian citizen, albeit of Eritrean nationality
    who was born in Addis Ababa and had never been to Eritrea nor taken any
    part in Eritrean independence activities, would face  a  real  risk  of
    persecution or breach of Article 3 on return.

7.   The appellant sought permission to appeal  to  the  Immigration  Appeal
    Tribunal.  The Vice President who considered the application  commented
    that it appeared clear that the appellant had no connection  whatsoever
    with Eritrea beyond the fact that her parents were of Eritrean  origin.
    He also noted that as she had been issued with an Ethiopian passport it
    would appear that she was a citizen of that country but  there  was  no
    proposal for her removal there but rather to  Eritrea.   He  considered
    that there were arguable issues as to the proposed destination.

8.   The Immigration Appeal Tribunal considered the matter on 12 June  2002.
     At paragraph 3 the Tribunal said that it appeared that the Adjudicator
    was misled into thinking that it  was  sufficient  for  him  to  decide
    whether the  appellant  had  a  well-founded  fear  of  persecution  in
    Eritrea, the country to which the Secretary of State proposed to remove
    her.  The Tribunal commented that the appellant's status as  a  refugee
    or not must depend upon whether she could establish a well-founded fear
    of persecution in Ethiopia, the country of which she appeared to  be  a
    national.  Despite the  fact  that  the  removal  directions  were  for
    Eritrea it was considered that the appellant's status as a refugee,  by
    reference to her country of nationality, was likely  to  be  a  crucial
    part of assessing her claim.  The Tribunal further commented that  with
    one  reservation  concerning  the  Adjudicator's  statement  that   the
    background material put in to support the case was not specific to  the
    appellant was incorrect, otherwise entirely endorsed what  he  said  in
    setting out his approach to the evidence which had been put in deriving
    from the expert Mr Gilkes.  The Tribunal ordered  that  the  appeal  be
    considered afresh by a different Adjudicator.

9.   The fresh hearing took place on 9 October 2002 before  the  Adjudicator
    Mrs Woolley.  The Adjudicator found the appellant's  evidence  credible
    allowing for misunderstandings which  could  arise  in  interpretation.
    She accepted that the appellant's husband was arrested and deported  to
    Eritrea taking  into  account  the  background  country  evidence,  and
    accepted that the appellant's in-laws and her son were presently  there
    also.   She  accepted,  taking  into  account  the   appellant's   age,
    inexperience of travel and  likely  state  of  confusion  at  the  time
    particularly bearing in mind recent childbirth, that she would not have
    queried handing her passport or travel documents of whatever nature  to
    the person who brought her to the United Kingdom, and might  well  have
    done so.  The nature of the documents was not explored at the hearing.

10.  In considering the appellant's nationality,  the  Adjudicator  accepted
    that when in the asylum interview the appellant claimed to be  Eritrean
    there could have been a misunderstanding over this  and  she  may  have
    meant "of Eritrean blood" especially taking into account problems  that
    could arise with interpretation.  She noted that in the original notice
    of appeal the appellant claimed to be Eritrean and the grounds said  it
    was doubtful as to which she was and it was unlikely either would  take
    her back.  In her subsequent appeal she claimed to  be  a  national  or
    former national of Ethiopia.

11.  As regards Eritrea, the Adjudicator noted that the  removal  directions
    were to Eritrea.  No attempt had been made by the appellant to obtain a
    passport or travel documents from the Eritrean or Ethiopian  embassies.
    She concluded on  the  evidence  before  her  that  the  appellant  was
    entitled to citizenship of Eritrea, it seems essentially on  the  basis
    that Eritrean nationality was available to those  born  in  Eritrea  or
    born abroad if either of their parents was  of  Eritrean  origin.   The
    Adjudicator said that even if the appellant's husband was a  member  of
    the ELF, and this was uncertain, there was no evidence whatsoever  that
    he was high profile and would now be of  interest  to  the  authorities
    there.  The appellant herself had never been politically  involved  and
    there was no evidence to  support  an  allegation  that  her  husband's
    possible political beliefs would be attributed  to  her.   It  appeared
    that returning members of the ELF who had held high  profile  positions
    in the ELF and had taken part in  activities  considered  to  be  of  a
    terrorist nature would experience problems but not  other  ELF  members
    and none of this appeared to apply to  the  appellant's  husband.   The
    Adjudicator did not think that there was a real risk that the appellant
    would be deported to Ethiopia were she to be sent to Eritrea, and  that
    she would be accepted in Eritrea.

12.   As  regards  Ethiopian  nationality,  the  Adjudicator  found  on  the
    evidence that the  appellant  was  also  Ethiopian,  basing  her  views
    essentially on the evidence of Dr Poole.  She did not accept  that  the
    appellant faced a real risk of persecution or breach of her  Article  3
    rights on return to Ethiopia.

13.   The  appeal  having  been  dismissed,  the  appellant   again   sought
    permission to appeal to the  Immigration  Appeal  Tribunal.   The  Vice
    President who considered  the  application  identified  two  particular
    issues of significance.  The first of these was the  issue  of  whether
    the appellant had  Eritrean  nationality  (as  well  as  Ethiopian)  or
    whether she merely had the de jure right  to  apply  for  it,  and  the
    second issue was whether she would  be  protected  by  the  authorities
    there.  Permission to appeal was accordingly granted.

14.  The matter came again before  the  Immigration  Appeal  Tribunal  on  9
    August  2004.   It  was  heard  together  with  two  other  cases   and
    subsequently became a country guidance case, MA and Others (Ethiopia  -
    mixed ethnicity - dual nationality) Eritrea [2004] UKIAT 00324.

15.   The  Tribunal  was  not  satisfied  that  the  evidence  showed   that
    Ethiopians of  Eritrean  or  part  Eritrean  ethnicity  fell  within  a
    category which on that basis alone established that they  had  a  well-
    founded fear of persecution.  The Tribunal accepted however that if the
    reality of the situation for an individual claimant was that he or  she
    was effectively deprived of citizenship which led  to  treatment  which
    would properly be categorised as persecution then, subject to the other
    requirements of the Convention, there was  a  right  to  claim  refugee
    status.  The Tribunal referred to the  judgment  of  Hutchinson  LJ  in
    Lazarevic [1997] 1 WLR 1107 that if a state arbitrarily excluded one of
    its citizens, therefore cutting him off from  enjoyment  of  all  those
    benefits and rights enjoined by citizens and duties owed by a state  to
    its citizens, then there was  no  difficulty  in  accepting  that  such
    conduct could amount to persecution.  The Tribunal commented  that  the
    deprival of citizenship by itself was not necessarily  persecutory  but
    it was the consequences of the deprivation of citizenship  which  might
    in the particular circumstances of the case amount to persecution.   If
    it led to treatment which could  properly  be  categorised  as  causing
    serious harm, it would amount to  persecution.   One  such  consequence
    might be that if  returned  to  Ethiopia  there  would  be  a  risk  of
    deportation or repatriation to Eritrea.  The Tribunal was not satisfied
    that there was now a government policy of mass deportations and it must
    follow that there was now no real risk for people of  Eritrean  descent
    generally of deportation on return though  this  did  not  preclude  an
    individual in a particular case being able  to  show  that  there  were
    specific reasons personal to him putting him at risk of deportation  by
    the Ethiopian authorities.  Again depending upon the  individual  facts
    of each appeal it might be  shown  that  some  Ethiopians  of  Eritrean
    descent remaining in Ethiopia might be at risk of  persecution  because
    of their ethnicity.

16.  The Tribunal went on to consider whether,  if  the  claimants  were  at
    risk of persecution in Ethiopia,  they  did  not  qualify  as  refugees
    because they could look to the Eritrean authorities for protection.  In
    the course of discussion the Tribunal considered what had been said  in
    YL (nationality - statelessness - Eritrea - Ethiopia) Eritrea CG [2003]
    UKIAT 00016 quoting the relevant paragraphs as follows.

        "44)      Since it is common ground that the appellant  is  not  as
             yet recognised as a national of Eritrea, it may be  asked,  why
             is it legitimate to even consider whether she is a national  of
             Eritrea?  Fortunately in order to answer this  question  we  do
             not need to embark  on  an  analysis  of  the  complexities  of
             nationality law. That is because,  following   Bradshaw  [1994]
             Imm AR 359, we consider it settled law that when a person  does
             not accept that the Secretary of State  is  correct  about  his
             nationality, it is incumbent on him to prove it, if need be  by
             making an application for such nationality.  That  is  all  the
             more necessary in the case of someone claiming to be a  refugee
             under  the   Refugee   Convention.   Under   that   Convention,
             establishing nationality (or statelessness) cannot be  left  as
             something that is optional for  the  claimant.  The  burden  of
             proof is on the claimant to prove his nationality (or  lack  of
             it). To leave it as an  optional  matter  would  also  make  it
             possible for bogus  claimants  to  benefit  from  international
             protection even though in law they had nationality of a country
             where they would not be at risk of persecution - simply by  not
             applying for that nationality. Furthermore, leaving  it  as  an
             optional matter would render unnecessary key provisions of  the
             definition in Art 1A(2) which require a person  to  be  outside
             the country of his nationality or outside the  country  of  his
             former habitual residence and which place special conditions on
             persons who have more than one  nationality.  As  was  said  by
             Rothstein J in the  Canadian  Federal  Court  case  of  Tatiana
             Bouianova v Minister of Employment and Immigration  [1993]  FCJ
             No 576, a case dealing with  statelessness,  "[t]he  definition
             should not be interpreted in such a manner as to render some of
             its words unnecessary or redundant."


        45)  Bearing in  mind  that  the  burden  of  proof  rests  on  the
             claimant, it is  always  relevant  to  enquire  in  such  cases
             whether a person has taken steps to apply for  the  nationality
             of the country in  question  or,  if  they  have  taken  steps,
             whether they have been successful or unsuccessful.


        46)  We would accept that in asylum cases  the  Bradshaw  principle
             has to be qualified to take account of whether there are  valid
             reasons for a claimant not approaching his or  her  embassy  or
             consulate - or the authorities of the country direct  -   about
             an application for citizenship or residence. In some cases such
             an approach could place the claimant or the  claimant's  family
             at risk, because for example it would alert the authorities  to
             the fact that the claimant has escaped pursuit by  fleeing  the
             country. However, by no means can there be a blanket assumption
             that for all claimants such approaches would create or increase
             risk. It is a matter to be examined  on  the  evidence  in  any
             particular case. The 1979 UNHCR Handbook  does  not  require  a
             different  position  to  be   taken:   paragraph   93   clearly
             contemplates a case-by-case approach."


17.  In each case it would be an issue of fact  whether  a  claimant  was  a
    national of a particular state.  In the present appeal  there  was,  on
    the face of the Eritrean legislation, an  entitlement  to  nationality.
    As regards the particular appellant, the  only  grounds  of  appeal  on
    which permission had been granted related to the issue of  whether  she
    could reasonably be expected to look to the  Eritrean  authorities  for
    protection and whether she would be at risk there.   The  Tribunal  was
    satisfied that the Adjudicator was entitled,  on  the  evidence  before
    her, to find that the appellant could look to the Eritrean  authorities
    for protection and would not be at  risk  of  persecution  there.   The
    Tribunal noted that the Secretary of State had indicated  that  he  was
    cancelling the removal directions for Eritrea and intended to  set  any
    future removal directions for Ethiopia.  Since the Secretary  of  State
    no longer intended to remove the appellant  to  Eritrea  there  was  no
    purpose to the Tribunal assessing whether there would now be a risk  on
    return  there.   The  Tribunal   concluded   that   the   Adjudicator's
    conclusions were properly open to her on the evidence.

18.  The appellant thereafter sought permission to appeal to  the  Court  of
    Appeal.  Permission was granted by the Tribunal on the basis of  issues
    relating to Eritrean citizenship and whether the Tribunal  should  have
    addressed the issue of risk in Eritrea.  The appeal was  allowed  on  1
    February 2006 on the basis that the appeal was remitted to  the  Asylum
    and Immigration Tribunal with the direction that it consider  only  the
    appellant's asylum and human rights appeals on the  basis  of  proposed
    removal to Ethiopia.  At a hearing on 9 November 2006 it was  clarified
    that the subsequent hearing would be a stage two hearing, the error  of
    law effectively having been identified in the order  of  the  Court  of
    Appeal.  At a hearing on 16 January 2007, as a  result  of  discussions
    with the representatives, the Tribunal issued a  memorandum  clarifying
    the issues that would be before the Tribunal and  making  a  number  of
    directions.

                              "MEMORANDUM TO THE PARTIES

        We have decided to adjourn the hearing fixed for today in  view  of
        the fact that the respondent had not had sight until today  of  the
        appellant's expert reports or skeleton argument.  However,  we  are
        grateful to the representatives for  assisting  us  in  seeking  to
        clarify the issues needing to be addressed at the full hearing.  As
        a result of discussions with the parties the following are agreed:


        The Factual basis
        The Adjudicator's findings of  fact  relating  to  the  appellant's
        personal history and experiences were found to  be  sustainable  by
        the Tribunal in MA and are to be treated as the factual basis  upon
        which this second-stage reconsideration will proceed.  However such
        findings are not to be taken as including  those  relating  to  her
        (claimed loss of) nationality,  as  that  are  clearly  a  disputed
        matter.


        The removability question
        Our understanding is that the respondent has cancelled the original
        removal directions, which were made to Eritrea, and  replaced  them
        with removal directions to Ethiopia.   Whilst  the  need  for  such
        directions is not a matter for us, we have been tasked by the Court
        of Appeal with considering only 'the Appellant's asylum  and  human
        rights appeals on the basis of the proposed removal  to  Ethiopia'.
        Accordingly the respondent is expected to clarify  whether  removal
        of this appellant to Ethiopia would only be proceeded with  if  she
        were found to be a national of Ethiopia  or  whether  it  would  be
        proceeded with on some other statutory basis.


        Relevant Ethiopian law
        In determining the issues relating to Ethiopian  nationality  which
        arise in this case, the relevant Ethiopian law  is:


             (i)   the Ethiopian Nationality Law 1930 (formally repealed  in
                 2003);
             (ii)  the Ethiopian Constitution, 1995;
             (iii) the Proclamation on Ethiopian Nationality No 378/2003 (23
                 December 2003);
             (iv)  The Directive of January 2004.


        In the absence of any specific indication by  the  parties  to  the
        contrary, we shall assume this to be the relevant legal framework.


        The legal principles
             (i)   Arbitrary exclusion from, or deprivation of,  nationality
                 can amount to persecution ('the Lazarevic principle');
             (ii)  If exclusion from,  or  deprivation  of,  nationality  is
                 persecutory in nature, then persecution arises.
             (iii) Exclusion from, or deprivation of  nationality  which  is
                 persecutory  in  nature  will  generally  mean   that   the
                 persecution is by reason of a Refugee Convention ground  of
                 nationality.  If the appellant is  able  to  show  a  well-
                 founded fear of persecution in this case, the  Tribunal  is
                 prepared to accept that it would be persecution for such  a
                 Refugee Convention reason;
             (iv)  In order to show she is a  refugee/is  at  real  risk  of
                 serious  harm  (under  para  339C  of  Cm6918)  or  of  ill
                 treatment contrary to Article 3, it is  necessary  for  the
                 appellant to show she faces a current risk.  The  principal
                 focus, so far as determining her nationality is  concerned,
                 is  also  on  her  current  nationality  or   her   current
                 entitlement to Ethiopian nationality under Ethiopian law;
             (v)   Even if the appellant cannot be removed to  Ethiopia  for
                 practical reasons she is entitled to a decision on  whether
                 her removal would  be  contrary  to  the  United  Kingdom's
                 obligations under the  Refugee  Convention,  or  the  Human
                 Rights Convention  or  would  be  not  in  accordance  with
                 paragraph 339C of the amended immigration rules (Cm69128).


        In the light of agreement on these principles we see no purpose  to
        any further submissions covering the above.


        The issues
        It is agreed that the appellant qualified as a national of Ethiopia
        under the 1995 Constitution by virtue of  her  birth  in  Ethiopia.
        She is only no longer a  national  of  Ethiopia  is  something  has
        happened to deprive her of it.


        1) The first main  issue  is  therefore  whether  by  operation  of
        Ethiopian law the appellant has  lost  her  Ethiopian  nationality.
        The sub-issues which arise here include whether those  of  Eritrean
        background effectively lost their nationality in 1999 by failing to
        register  with  the  Ethiopian  Security  and  Immigration  Refugee
        Affairs Authority; whether the provisions of the 2003  Proclamation
        preserve Ethiopian nationality for such persons  so  long  as  they
        have not taken active steps to  acquire  another  nationality;  and
        whether the provisions  of  the  2004  Directive  do  not  preserve
        Ethiopian nationality for those who have not taken active steps  to
        acquire another nationality.


        1A) Assuming the appellant has lost her  Ethiopian  nationality  by
        operation of Ethiopian law, then the next  issue  is  whether  that
        deprivation gives rise  to  a  well-founded  fear  of  persecution.
        Examination of that issue will need to cover both the  position  of
        the class of persons of Eritrean background  who  have  lost  their
        nationality by operation of Ethiopian  law  and  sub-categories  of
        persons who have additional characteristics which may give rise  to
        risk (e.g. a political profile, a history of deportation, relatives
        who have been deported etc).


        1B) A possible sub-issue  arising  here  is  whether  a  person  of
        Eritrean background with a history of having lived in  Ethiopia  as
        an Ethiopian national but who has now  lost  Ethiopian  nationality
        may nevertheless be able to  return  as  an  alien  and  reside  in
        Ethiopia under the yellow card system.


        2) The second main issue, which only arises  if  the  appellant  is
        found not to have lost her Ethiopian nationality,  is  whether  she
        would still face a real risk on return by  virtue  of  the  removal
        process, seen as  encompassing  both  dealing  with  the  Ethiopian
        Embassy in the UK (seeking to obtain a passport or travel document)
        and with the situation that would face such a  person  if  returned
        and any relevant risk factors (e.g. onward deportation is suggested
        by the appellant's representatives to be one such a factor).


        Directions
        We indicated to Mr Fripp that we would be greatly assisted if steps
        were taken by the appellant's representatives to  obtain  a  report
        separate from those already before  us,  ideally  one  from  Cedric
        Barnes, such a report to cover both  the  general  issues  we  have
        identified and the issues particular to  this  appellant's  history
        and circumstances (as found by the Adjudicator).


        We indicated to Ms Brown that we would be assisted by action  being
        taken on the part of  the  respondent  to  make  enquiries  of  the
        Ethiopian Embassy in London consisting in the following questions:


        Questions to the Ethiopian Embassy:
             1.    If a person is  an  Ethiopian  national  under  Ethiopian
                 nationality law, but of Eritrean background, will he now be
                 entitled to Ethiopian nationality?

             2.    Would a person who was born and lived in  Ethiopia  until
                 1999 and then left and who is of  Eritrean  parentage,  his
                 parents having been Ethiopian nationals at the time of  his
                 birth, now be entitled to an Ethiopian  passport  or  other
                 recognition of Ethiopian nationality?

             3.    What are the requirements (apart from proof of  identity)
                 for such a person (see Question 2) being able to obtain  an
                 Ethiopian  passport  or  other  recognition  of   Ethiopian
                 nationality?

             4.    Since 1999 and particularly since January 2004, has  your
                 Embassy granted or issued any such person in  the  UK  (see
                 Question 2) with an Ethiopian passport or travel document?"


19.  The appeal was heard by us on 10 and 11 September 2007.

20.  Mr Fripp referred to the second witness statement of  Anne  Scruton  of
    the Border and Immigration Agency, together with the  fax  from  Sylvia
    Rosenbaum of the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) and the
    attached email of Mr Ajeti also of the IOM.  Mr Fripp argued that given
    the late production of these documents they should not be allowed in as
    evidence, but if they were then permission should be granted  for  them
    to be put to the expert Herr Schr�der for him to comment.

21.  Ms Giovannetti said that the fax from Ms Rosenbaum and the  email  from
    Mr Ajeti were not put in because they were relied  on  but  to  exhibit
    what was said in order to be fair to the appellant and to  present  the
    fullest  picture  to  the  Tribunal.   The  second  paragraph   of   Ms
    Rosenbaum's statement in fact did not assist the Secretary of State  at
    all.  There was no question concerning the appellant's IND card in this
    case, but it would have been improper to keep it back.  Therefore  they
    properly asked for Mr Ajeti's views.  It was mainly a problem  for  the
    Secretary of State and therefore Ms Giovannetti would object to further
    expert evidence from the appellant's side.  What was relied on from the
    IOM was in and attached to Ms Scruton's  first  witness  statement  and
    could have been objected to at any time.

22.  After consideration  we  concluded  that  we  would  proceed  with  the
    evidence as it was before us.  We saw no good reason either to  exclude
    the most recent evidence or to adjourn so that  Herr  Schr�der  or  any
    other expert could consider it.

The Evidence of Mr Beaumont

23.  Ms Giovannetti then proceeded to call her witness,  Nigel  Beaumont  of
    the  Returns  Group  Documentation  Unit  (RGDU)  of  the  Border   and
    Immigration Agency.  Mr Beaumont had put in two statements,  the  first
    dated 19 July 2007 and the second dated 6 September 2007.  He had  read
    through them both again and had nothing to clarify or amend.  Statement
    two represented a degree of clarification in itself.  At  paragraph  10
    of his first statement there were identified a number  of  cases  where
    emergency travel documents (ETDs) had  been  issued  by  the  Ethiopian
    authorities.  These were samples, as on removal the unit did  not  keep
    the file.  They were taken from a sample of some 20 to 25  cases  where
    it was agreed the person was to be removed.  The  others  had  not  had
    mixed parentage.  These  examples  were  consistent  with  his  working
    experience.

24.  Mr Beaumont had brought with him and produced copies  of  an  Ethiopian
    laissez passer, and of the bio data form completed by or on  behalf  of
    applicants and the bio data forms for the people listed at paragraph 10
    of his first statement.

25.  Mr Fripp was content for these documents  to  be  put  in,  subject  to
    copies being provided.

26.  As to the stage in the claims process where Mr  Beaumont's  job  linked
    in, applications came to his unit usually when appeal rights  had  been
    exhausted and there was no barrier to removal.  It was done then, as he
    understood it, as it would be illegal to remove a person while they had
    an outstanding claim in the United Kingdom.  It could be different with
    the new asylum model as those were received after the initial appeal.

27.  Applications would come to his  unit  and  were  computerised  and  the
    appellant would be sent with a letter to the relevant embassy.  In  the
    last two or three months they had had an agreement with  the  Ethiopian
    Embassy as was set out at paragraph 6  of  his  first  statement  that,
    where the criteria set out there were met, a person could be removed on
    the basis of  an  EU  letter  where  there  was  conclusive  supporting
    documentation.  The EU letter was a one way travel  document.   When  a
    person was removed on an EU letter, it was for immigration  control  in
    the country in question to carry out any further checks that they might
    have and if they found that the person was not of that nationality  the
    United Kingdom would accept them back.  This was part of the EU  letter
    process.  It had only been a pilot so far and they  only  did  it  when
    they were confident about the documents.  He agreed that  there  should
    not be a need for checks where a person was subjected to the process of
    an interview  and  the  embassy  issued  a  laissez  passer.   In  such
    circumstances again there was an agreement that  they  would  be  taken
    back if they were not accepted and again this would be  at  the  United
    Kingdom's expense.

28.  The Ethiopians had confirmed that they were content to  accept  laissez
    passers for older cases if a person had got a laissez passer before and
    then made a further appeal.  There  were  also  cases  where  they  had
    applied for a laissez passer before the EU letter agreement.  The cases
    listed at paragraph 10 of the first statement were  fresh  claims  made
    after an ETD application had been made.  The unit did not withdraw  the
    travel document application but would not remove until the barriers  to
    removal had gone.  The Ethiopians only interviewed people on  two  days
    in a week.  Interviews could be scheduled some three or four  weeks  in
    advance.  After the interview the unit would contact the embassy on the
    next day to get the result and they would give a  verbal  confirmation.
    A formal confirmation was not needed.  The unit would contact the  case
    owners to set the removal directions  and  fix  the  flight  and  would
    collect the travel documents from the embassy usually after about  five
    days and they would get the documentation a couple of days  before  the
    flight.

29.  He was  asked  whether  he  was  surprised  about  the  fact  that  the
    appellant's solicitors had  written  to  the  Embassy  to  confirm  her
    situation and had had no reply and nor had the Treasury Solicitor.   Mr
    Beaumont said it could depend on the embassy  in  question.   They  had
    links with a good number of embassies and  good  relations  with  most.
    There had been a change some three or four months ago at the  Ethiopian
    Embassy and that could explain why there were a  few  problems  as  the
    person who had come in was new to the role.  Mr Beaumont had  met  this
    person and he was very cooperative with his unit.

30.  On cross-examination Mr Beaumont was asked by Mr Fripp whether he  knew
    about Ethiopia returning anyone sent to that country.  He said that the
    unit would normally be told.  The case owners would tell them if  there
    was a problem with a removal, and the unit would ask the  embassy  what
    had happened.  If it was an escorted removal they would give  a  report
    to say why the person was refused entry.  He  was  not  aware  of  this
    happening with Ethiopia.  He had been in his job since April  2004  and
    had been concerned with Ethiopia for the last two years as one  of  the
    countries for which he had  responsibility.   He  was  unaware  of  any
    failures with the use of the  EU  letter.   It  was  dealt  with  by  a
    different department, but it was rare to have  problems  if  a  laissez
    passer was issued.

31.  About 80 people worked in his  unit.   He  was  responsible  for  about
    twelve countries.  Before April 2007 the unit had eight  country  teams
    each of which was responsible for five or six  countries.   There  were
    about 59 countries in total.  He had been responsible  for  two  teams.
    In April 2007 they had reorganised when the former ISDU became the RGDU
    and was split into three larger teams  which  were,  broadly  speaking,
    concerned with particular continents.  He had been asked to go  on  the
    African team.   There  were  four  separate  teams  within  that,  each
    responsible for five to six countries.  He covered two of those smaller
    teams and Ethiopia was in one of them.  In  total  they  were  Algeria,
    Zimbabwe, Sudan, Rwanda, Gambia, Ethiopia, Angola, Eritrea,  the  Ivory
    Coast, Senegal, Egypt and Liberia.  He agreed that there had been a lot
    of Zimbabwean, Sudanese and Eritrean cases recently.  He was asked what
    proportion of the overall cases of the two teams  were  Ethiopian.   He
    said that each team had two or three larger countries and the Ethiopian
    team also had the Ivory Coast and Angola.  It was one  of  the  busiest
    countries in terms of cases and there were  a  number  of  applications
    received in that team for emergency travel documents.  There had been a
    recent drop in numbers since the EU pilot letter project, as  the  unit
    did not deal with those but they were dealt with by RESCU which  was  a
    separate department which would book flights for removals and  work  on
    pilots including EU letters.  He  could  outline  their  processes  but
    could not say at first hand what they did.

32.  He was asked how many Ethiopians applied for asylum  and  said  he  did
    not know.  He could find out the  numbers  received  in  the  last  two
    months.  They had only begun to keep  statistics  of  numbers  received
    around two and a half years ago from about December 2005.  Therefore he
    could not say about the number of Ethiopians or people of Ethiopian and
    Eritrean heritage.  They did not  record  that  information  for  their
    statistical purposes but could only give the cases that he had given as
    cases which they had.

33.  He was asked whether he could say when the people in question  came  to
    the United Kingdom.  He said no, the RGDU would not deal with that  but
    only the details on the emergency travel  document  application.   With
    regard to the nature of their claims, he could only say something about
    that if he looked at the files.  His unit did not disclose the fact  of
    an asylum claim or a criminal conviction in  the  United  Kingdom,  but
    they could not control embassy interviews.  The embassies were aware of
    their policy in that regard.

34.  As to who would carry out the interviews, he was told by their  contact
    there that there would be a panel of three or  four  embassy  officials
    with  varying  functions.   It  was  one  of  the  higher  numbers   of
    interviewers of the countries  of  which  he  knew.   A  lot  would  do
    telephone interviews only, and it could be an Immigration Officer would
    be available to answer questions that the  embassy  official  had.   If
    they interviewed in person then it would usually be one to two  people.
    It was not  usual  for  anyone  from  his  department  to  attend  such
    interviews.  Occasionally they might: if there was a  specific  project
    then a person from the RGDU could be present.  Usually it would just be
    embassy  staff.   There  could  be  escorts  and  there  could  be   an
    Immigration Officer but usually no-one from his unit and certainly  not
    from his department.  He was asked about whether it would be  different
    if there were a pilot project and he said, yes.  He  could  not  recall
    this ever happening with  Ethiopia.   His  unit  had  always  had  this
    process in place up to the EU pilot letter scheme.  He  could  not  say
    what proportion of cases was dealt with in that way as his unit did not
    handle the EU letter cases.

35.  He was asked whether physical returns to Addis Ababa were  also  within
    his responsibility.  He said the flight booking would be done by RESCU.
     He thought the escorts were usually Group 4  security  people.   There
    would be a risk assessment of each individual.  This would be the  same
    with medical escorts.  He believed that Group 4  were  contractors  but
    his unit were not involved with  arranging  it,  though  they  got  the
    documentation.  He was not personally aware  of  people  who  had  been
    returned to Ethiopia and then sent back  on  ETDs  without  looking  at
    their records or in decided cases.  Usually they would be told of  such
    cases so they could pursue them with the embassy.  He was not aware  of
    any cases in this regard concerning Ethiopia.

36.  His unit did not  deal  with  voluntary  returns.   Assisted  voluntary
    returns (AVR) dealt with those.  This was the unit of which Ms  Scruton
    was Acting Head.  Mr Beaumont's unit dealt  with  what  was  considered
    enforced removal.  A removal  could  switch  from  them  if  it  became
    voluntary.  The IOM would help such people sometimes.  He  was  unaware
    of any  such  cases  involving  Ethiopians.   The  IOM  dealt  with  Ms
    Scruton's department.  It would be possible for figures to be  provided
    about the number of people rejected by the Ethiopian Embassy, but  they
    did not give a reason  except  that  they  did  not  accept  they  were
    Ethiopian.  He could not say how often that happened.  He was  referred
    to the laissez passer form that he had provided and said  it  had  been
    filled out and stamped by the Ethiopians.  It was suggested to him that
    the fact that it referred to the transitional government of Ethiopia at
    the top left suggested that it was quite an old document and he said he
    did not know and it was the one currently  used.   They  spoke  to  the
    embassy and they got the document.  He agreed that the main facts  were
    those as set out in the cases at paragraph 10 at statement 1  and  that
    information was mainly taken off the bio data form.  It  was  completed
    by the appellant or on their behalf if they  were  non-compliant  which
    was often the case, from information they had given.

37.  On re-examination Ms Giovannetti asked Mr Beaumont, with regard to  the
    details at paragraph 10 of the first statement, whether there  was  any
    further information other than what was contained there  about  any  of
    these cases.  He said there was only such information for case  1.   He
    had been asked to give the date of the Ethiopian passport issue and  he
    had got that and it said 17 June 2005 and case number 23463 on the pass
    but was issued on 15 September 1992.  For case 27915 the  passport  was
    issued on 21 June 2005.  His unit was not concerned with whether it was
    a current passport or not but with whatever documentation was likely to
    help get a travel document, and there would be records  the  Ethiopians
    could check.  He  was  asked  whether  he  knew  if  anyone  could  get
    statistics about the family background of people who had been  rejected
    for emergency travel documents.  He was not aware of this.  He said  it
    could be that the statistics department held such  information  but  he
    doubted it.  Mainly such information would  be  likely  to  be  on  the
    individual person's paper file.  He was asked whether  there  were  any
    underlying reasons behind a person being rejected  simply  because  the
    Embassy did not accept a person was an  Ethiopian  national.   He  said
    that no such information would be given by the Ethiopians.  They  would
    say they were not persuaded or the person was  not  very  compliant  at
    interview and did not want to be removed and would not comply so as  to
    avoid removal, and they could be told that  the  person  had  given  no
    information.  If that happened then they went back to the case owner to
    try and provide any supporting evidence they might have.  He was  asked
    whether they could get them  documented  if  there  was  no  supporting
    evidence and the person said they were Eritrean.  He said no, they  did
    not have documents about Eritrea.  There was nothing they could do with
    that.  It would be possible to go for  an  assisted  voluntary  removal
    with financial help on return  or  if  there  were  a  need  to  return
    urgently.

38.  We asked  Mr  Beaumont  whether  there  were  differences  between  the
    procedures adopted by his unit and those of the AVR.  He said that,  if
    there were an enforced removal, the person would  be  escorted  to  the
    plane and there could be an escort on the  flight  also.   Usually  the
    airline staff were given the  travel  documents.   There  would  be  no
    direct contact between his unit and the appellant.  The case owners and
    the embassy dealt with that kind of issue.  We asked him how  his  unit
    would find out whether there was a change of policy  direction  in  the
    Ethiopian Embassy, for example with regard  to  the  issue  of  the  EU
    letters.  He said that his unit liaised with the International Delivery
    Directorate and their Special Operations Unit and they tried to set  up
    return agreements  with  various  countries  setting  up  memoranda  of
    understanding.   They  had  close  relations  with  the   Foreign   and
    Commonwealth Office.  His unit had learned that  the  Ethiopians  would
    accept EU letters.

39.  We asked Mr Beaumont whether ever anything other than  Ethiopian  would
    be put as the nationality on a laissez passer and he said he would  not
    have thought so.  The bio data forms contained  the  information  taken
    from what the appellant had said and not  from  what  the  Home  Office
    said.  The person would complete it, although  it  would  be  based  on
    information that they had previously given.  His unit would not tend to
    submit the form if the person did not say they were  Ethiopian,  as  it
    would just annoy the embassy.  It could be completed on  their  behalf,
    based on the information they had given earlier and they  could  put  a
    covering note or sheet with the form.  There was also  the  possibility
    of prosecution under Section 35 for non-compliance which could be  held
    out as a threat.  A person could not be allowed to  stay  just  because
    they refused to give information.  We asked him about the IND card  and
    he said he thought it was the ARC card used by asylum  seekers  in  the
    United Kingdom to get benefits, based on the nationality  they  claimed
    to have on entry to the United Kingdom.  He was asked how  the  embassy
    would get to see it and he said it could be information used by the IOM
    to get information from the embassy.

40.  We asked him what the new EU letter procedure would entail with  regard
    to new cases that his unit got and whether they would no longer ask for
    laissez passers.  He said  that  if  the  person  had  good  supporting
    evidence and was of Ethiopian nationality RESCU would deal  with  them.
    The EU letter cases never came to his unit.  But if there were no  such
    evidence, the application would come to them and they would go  through
    the interview process.  The  embassy  would  not  interview  EU  letter
    people, but they would be interviewed by an  Immigration  Officer  when
    returned to Ethiopia.  The IND card could be the same as a landing card
    in a particular case.

41.  Mr Beaumont was asked about people who  could  seek  to  frustrate  the
    process and give a different nationality, for example in the new bundle
    he had put in today at page 8, where there was reference  to  a  person
    whose nationality was recorded as  Ethiopian  on  the  bio  data  form,
    though they were said to claim to be Eritrean.  He was asked whether it
    was worth sending such a form to the Ethiopian  Embassy  if  there  was
    this contrast.  He said that they had a copy of the Ethiopian  passport
    in that case so there  was  good  supporting  evidence,  and  a  travel
    document had been issued.  With regard to page 1  of  that  bundle,  he
    reiterated that he had never seen an Ethiopian  laissez  passer  saying
    anything other than that the person was of Ethiopian  nationality.   It
    was the case that if there was not good supporting  evidence  then  the
    case would come to his unit rather than being an EU  letter  case.   He
    was asked whether if there was no supporting documentation it helped if
    in the bio data form he could say for example  when  the  passport  had
    been issued.   He  said  not  so  with  regard  to  Ethiopia,  as  they
    interviewed, but it could help with some countries.  With  Ethiopia  it
    was mainly a question of what happened at the interview and that  would
    determine what the embassy would do.

42.  On re-examination by Mr Fripp Mr Beaumont confirmed that his  team  did
    not sit in on interviews and very little information was given to  them
    by the embassy.  They would  not  therefore  know  if  the  person  was
    cooperative or not.  The embassy could possibly tell them.  With regard
    to the database he referred to, the RDS system, there  were  no  fields
    with regard to such matters  as  parentage  and  family  details.   The
    situation from December 2005 was local to his unit and before that they
    did not count the number of  applications  or  details.   There  was  a
    system under which the whole of the United Kingdom Immigration  Service
    could access SID which was a very large database.

43.   The  Special  Operations  Section  in   the   International   Delivery
    Directorate might have changed its name.  They dealt with questions  of
    policy and assisted his unit with the documentation  process.   He  was
    asked whether there was any formal document setting out  the  basis  of
    the agreement with regard to the EU letter.  He said there might be but
    he was not aware of a formal document with the Ethiopians.  There  were
    memoranda of  understanding  with  other  countries  and  they  usually
    referred to documentation processes.  They would include  such  matters
    as timescales and documentation expectations etcetera.  He was not sure
    when the bio data forms were usually completed.  He thought that  under
    the new asylum model it was at the time of the claim and it  was  kept,
    but only went to his unit after the  initial  adverse  decision.   This
    went  with  the  ETD  applications  and  this   was   fairly   standard
    information.




Submissions

44.  This concluded Mr Beaumont's evidence.   Ms  Giovannetti  was  able  to
    clarify in respect of the IND card that this was the ARC card  referred
    to by Mr Beaumont and it was given to a person when they claimed asylum
    and this would entitle them to benefits.

45.  Mr Fripp referred to pages 1 to 4 of the supplementary bundle and  also
    5 to 6 concerning the documentation seeking information  on  behalf  of
    both sides from the Ethiopian Embassy.  In each case there had been  no
    further attempt to chase a response and no response to either party.

46.  Ms Giovannetti was also able to clarify that, since  1  December  2005,
    166 applications had been submitted to  the  Ethiopian  Embassy  up  to
    today's date, and fourteen had been rejected as not  Ethiopian.   There
    was no breakdown of these figures.

47.  In his submissions, Mr  Fripp  was  content  to  accept  those  figures
    without further enquiry.  He accepted that Appendix A to the  Secretary
    of State's skeleton was a fair summary of the appellant's  history  and
    claim.  With regard to item U, he understood the appellant to have been
    to both embassies, and there was a witness statement with regard to her
    visit to the Ethiopian Embassy.  The Adjudicator had found that she had
    family in Ethiopia and left when the deportations were continuing.

48.  The first issue was whether the appellant had lost her  nationality  by
    operation of Ethiopian law.  It was common ground that she possessed de
    jure nationality.  Mr Fripp accepted that, before 1998,  the  appellant
    was  entitled  to  Ethiopian  nationality  under  the  1930   Ethiopian
    Nationality Law and, after  1995,  she  was  entitled  under  the  1995
    Ethiopian constitution, Article 6.  Article 33 of the same constitution
    gave protection against arbitrary deprivation of nationality.  Ethiopia
    had not accepted dual nationality with any  other  country.   Mr  Fripp
    noted that this question was raised before the Eritrea/Ethiopia  Claims
    Commission (the Commission) as to whether a post-1993 memorandum to the
    states entailed that a person opting  for  Eritrean  nationality  under
    Eritrean law lost their Ethiopian nationality.  This remained  an  open
    question, as the Commission had concluded it was  impossible  to  judge
    the status of the memorandum.  But no proper steps had  been  taken  by
    Ethiopia to deal with the bar on dual nationality.  However, there  was
    no need to tackle the dual nationality issue, as the appellant had done
    nothing to opt for Eritrean nationality, for example  by  participating
    in  the  referendum.   As  she  had  evident  de  jure  entitlement  to
    continuing Ethiopian nationality, she was a national of Ethiopia.

49.  The only problem was the attitude of the  Ethiopian  authorities.   War
    broke out in May/June 1998, and after that the Ethiopians had a project
    of removing the nationality of many of  their  citizens  if  they  were
    partly or wholly of Eritrean background.  The evidence tended to show a
    campaign against people who were entirely or partly Eritrean nationals,
    or of that regional background, as, for example, could be seen  in  the
    Human Rights Watch Report at Section E2, Section (iv).   This  campaign
    had been marked by arbitrariness, and there had been  no  due  process.
    They were not  Ethiopian  nationals,  but  were  said  to  be  Eritrean
    nationals, and this was said to  be  the  case  by  Ethiopia.   It  was
    questionable whether this was so arbitrary that  people  who  were  not
    Eritrean were swept up in this.  Often, heads  of  family  were  seized
    initially and there was pressure on their dependants  to  follow  them.
    It was close to compulsion.

50.  As of 2003, more than two years after the end of the war, none  of  the
    deportees had been permitted to return  from  Eritrea,  and  the  Human
    Rights Watch Report again dealt with this.  In his  report,  Mr  Gilkes
    made the point that the criteria for  judging  those  affected  by  the
    policy were quite indiscriminate, for example  possession  of  Eritrean
    documentation would suffice.  This included family origin, and it could
    be as little a connection as one Eritrean grandparent.   The  procedure
    was relatively unplanned and quite chaotic and arbitrary.

51.  Mr Fripp referred to the standard of proof employed by  the  Commission
    and argued that it had been very high and that also the limited mandate
    of the Commission should be borne  in  mind.   Although  the  appellant
    perhaps retained de jure entitlement to Ethiopian nationality, de facto
    that had been terminated as she was a member of a  class  whose  rights
    had been thus terminated.  The nature of nationality  in  international
    law went beyond  de  jure  nationality,  as  could  be  seen  from  the
    Nottebohm case (Second Phase) [1955] ICJ Rep 4, and this  was  referred
    to at page 15 of Mr Fripp's skeleton.  The 2004 Directive, at paragraph
    2, limited its ambit to people who  were  in  Ethiopia  in  June  2004,
    having been there continuously since 1993.

52.  Mr Fripp argued that, though EB (Ethiopia) [2007] EWCA Civ 809 did  not
    present a direct factual  precedent,  deprivation  of  nationality,  if
    arbitrary and a decision of the executive alone and  for  a  Convention
    reason, was sufficient to amount to persecution.  Mr Fripp argued  that
    the application of the 2004 Directive to Determine the Residence Status
    of Eritrean Nationals Residing in Ethiopia ('the 2004  Directive')  was
    quite limited, and  that  this  was  supported  by  what  was  said  by
    Professor Cliffe,  Mr  Gilkes,  Herr  Schroeder  and  Mr  Barnes.   The
    protection of Article  33  of  the  1995  Constitution  and  protection
    against arbitrary deprivation was nugatory, as could  be  seen  in  the
    Commission report, so it was necessary  to  look  at  the  reality  and
    practice and not the  position  on  paper.   Mr  Barnes'  evidence  was
    relevant in this regard.  Mr Beaumont had been unable to assist  as  to
    what happened in the interviews at the Ethiopian Embassy,  except  with
    regard to the decision.  It was not possible to say whether  the  cases
    to which Mr Beaumont referred had remained in Ethiopia between 1993 and
    2004 and would therefore benefit from the  2003  Proclamation  and  the
    2004 Directive.  The IOM evidence was very ambivalent.  In  any  event,
    the  IOM  was   involved   only   in   voluntary   returns,   and   was
    unrepresentative of the position across the board.  Whether or not  the
    appellant had de jure nationality was irrelevant if the evidence tended
    to show a de facto refusal.   The  matter  required  to  be  considered
    against all the background evidence, including the  Ethiopian  attitude
    to Eritrean residents since 1998.  On the EB approach, there was  a  de
    facto  deprivation  of  nationality.   The  evidence  of  the   experts
    supported the argument that rights attaching to nationality were widely
    withheld in Ethiopia in cases concerning people of Eritrean background.
     The risk factor of the appellant's husband being an ELF member  should
    be borne in mind, and also the references in  the  Human  Rights  Watch
    Report to the numbers of people who had been involved in removals  from
    Ethiopia on account of Eritrean ethnicity.

53.  Mr Fripp argued that cases would be very fact sensitive.  The  evidence
    showed the arbitrary nature of the actions of the Ethiopian  government
    in victimising people, and the expert evidence bore  this  out.   If  a
    person was of Eritrean descent then it was fact sensitive and  relevant
    if there was nothing adverse and they had had a continuing presence  in
    Ethiopia during the war, but usually  there  would  be  problems  if  a
    person had at least one Eritrean parent.

54.  With regard to the question of whether a person would be persecuted  if
    returned on the basis that they were not an  Ethiopian  national  under
    the yellow card scenario but had  a  history  of  birth  and  residence
    there, Mr Fripp argued that they would face a continuing deprivation of
    nationality and a lack of  the  attached  rights  to  which  they  were
    entitled under Ethiopian law.  As had been held by the US Supreme Court
    in Trop v Dulles (1957) 356 US 86, even an alien had some rights.  But,
    on return to Ethiopia, such a person would not be in that position,  as
    they would suffer a lack of due  process  or  rights  as  an  alien  in
    Ethiopia.  Herr Schroeder's evidence at page 89 was relevant  to  this.
    So, even if the appellant got to Ethiopia, she  would  be  at  risk  of
    persecution.  It was accepted that an alien in Ethiopia with a  history
    of residence would not be at risk, but this should be  contrasted  with
    the position of a non-national who was not entitled to nationality, as,
    in that case, there would not be an entitlement to all the rights of  a
    citizen of Ethiopia.

55.  In her submissions Ms Giovannetti reminded us firstly of the fact  that
    there has to be a current well-founded fear of  persecution,  and  that
    although an arbitrary  deprivation  of  nationality  for  a  Convention
    reason might amount to persecution, that would not  always  necessarily
    be the case.  It would in most cases however, as  it  would  amount  to
    serious harm.  It was argued however on  behalf  of  the  Secretary  of
    State though that on the evidence relating to the  appellant  it  could
    not be put higher than that the appellant at some  point  in  the  past
    faced a risk of arbitrary deprivation of nationality.

56.  The decision in EB was very much on its own  facts.   It  did  not  say
    that Ethiopians of Eritrean family or ethnicity  would  in  general  be
    deprived of their nationality.  The critical findings of fact  were  at
    paragraphs 8, 9, 11 and 12 and also at 62 and 63.  The crucial  finding
    there was that active steps had been taken to deprive the appellant  of
    her nationality.  There were serious consequences arising from the loss
    of nationality even if the appellant in EB could go back  as  had  been
    said, and there was no rebuttal evidence.

57.  With regard to the instant appeal, it was clear that the appellant  had
    de jure Ethiopian nationality.  There was no identifiable provision  of
    Ethiopian law under which she could have lost her nationality  and  nor
    was there any identifiable  executive  or  administrative  act  to  the
    effect that she was not an Ethiopian national.  The same was true  with
    regard to de facto nationality.  There was no clear evidence  that  the
    Ethiopian authorities would  refuse  to  accept  her  as  an  Ethiopian
    national or that they had ever done so.  They had not  taken  away  her
    documents and had not deported her.

58.  The appellant's case was based mainly on expert evidence to the  effect
    that the Ethiopian authorities would not accept an  Ethiopian  national
    of Eritrean parentage.  The essence of that evidence was at page  9  of
    Professor Cliffe's report.  It could be that what Professor Cliffe said
    there was very specific about being granted citizenship,  as  that  was
    not what the Ethiopian Embassy did: it did not grant passports but  one
    would get travel documents only.  There was clear evidence from the IOM
    that, as long as a person said they wanted to go back to  Ethiopia  and
    could show that they were de jure an Ethiopian national, they would  be
    documented as an Ethiopian national and would be returned.  The  thrust
    of the expert evidence was anecdotal.  It should be borne in mind  that
    an asylum seeker or human rights claimant was very likely not  to  want
    to return.  Mr Beaumont had said in  his  evidence  that  it  was  much
    easier if a person wanted to go back.  It was right to say, as Mr Fripp
    had, that there was no corroboration, but that cut both ways, as it was
    as likely that people were uncooperative as it was that the  Ethiopians
    acted arbitrarily.  Mr Beaumont's evidence was  inconsistent  with  any
    Ethiopian practice of granting travel documents to people they did  not
    accept as Ethiopian nationals.  His  first  report  was  in  particular
    relevant to paragraphs 4 and 7 to 9.  He had said that  the  Ethiopians
    might  give  a  person  travel  documents  if  they  did   not   accept
    nationality, but this would be exceptional.  It was clear in the  round
    that the effect of the laissez passer was to confirm nationality.   The
    IOM documentation was consistent with that.  Mr Ajeti's letter was also
    relevant.  More importantly, this was inconsistent with the proposition
    that the Ethiopian  Embassy  would  reject  a  person  if  of  Eritrean
    heritage.  Professor Cliffe's point was  not  right,  given  the  IOM's
    evidence.

59.  From Mr Beaumont's evidence it  could  be  seen  that  there  were  166
    applicants since December 2005 and only fourteen had been  rejected  as
    not being Ethiopian.  It was necessary to look at the statistics in the
    light of the cases set out at  paragraph  10  of  Mr  Beaumont's  first
    statement.  As he had explained,  he  looked  at  twenty  or  so  files
    currently in the unit and found eight which  contained  an  element  of
    Eritrean origins and they were a variety of cases.  The results of  his
    survey were completely inconsistent with the  anecdotal  evidence  that
    being of Eritrean ethnicity meant deprivation of nationality.

60.  It was significant, Ms Giovannetti continued,  that  the  IOM  evidence
    was consistent with the Home Office evidence.  The IOM was independent,
    though it had some Home Office funding, but it was clearly very anxious
    to be, and to be seen to  be,  independent  and  impartial.   This  was
    demonstrated by the fact  that  they  had  shown  they  were  initially
    unhappy to give information and also the fact that they had  eventually
    notified Ms Scruton about the problem case.  If the appellant  went  to
    the Embassy then the same would be the case.  It was  clear  that  they
    would consider the nationality on the IND card.  However  a  newer  IND
    card could be issued bearing in mind that the Home Office knew that the
    appellant was Ethiopian and that that was her claim  also.   There  was
    also one of the cases in  Mr  Beaumont's  list  where  the  person  had
    claimed to be Eritrean but had been given documentation  for  Ethiopia.
    Mr Beaumont had good relations with  the  Embassy  and  it  was  highly
    likely that the matter could be sorted out as on the evidence it  could
    not safely be concluded that the appellant would  be  rejected  on  the
    basis of an IND card alone.

61.  This tied into another point, namely  that  if  a  country  refused  to
    recognise a person as a national if they were genuinely  not  satisfied
    that he or she was not a national then this would not be arbitrary  and
    would not be persecution.  Reference was made to the decision  in  Chen
    in the bundle as an example of a case where it could be very  difficult
    to get confirmation of nationality.  If a state was not satisfied  that
    a person was a national  then  it  was  entitled  to  refuse  to  issue
    documents, and the word "arbitrary" was relevant.

62.  Mr Beaumont's evidence was also  consistent  with  what  the  appellant
    said.  From Appendix A(j) to the skeleton, it could be seen  that  this
    was part of the  appellant's  accepted  evidence  that  she  had  never
    considered herself as an Eritrean national as  opposed  to  someone  of
    Eritrean  ethnic  origin  resident  in  Ethiopia   and   Ethiopian   by
    nationality.  It could not be explained why, if the appellant genuinely
    wanted Ethiopian nationality to be recognised and  believed  that  they
    would turn her down that she would go to the embassy and  say  she  was
    Eritrean and had come for an Ethiopian passport, which was her evidence
    in the statement.  Mr Fripp had not chosen to  call  the  appellant  to
    speak to this and what she said had not been qualified in any way.   Mr
    Fripp had submitted that before the first Adjudicator the appellant had
    said she was not Eritrean but meant that she  was  of  Eritrean  blood.
    That was five years ago and the circumstances were very different  now.
    She had not suggested that her statement was a mistake.   She  did  not
    say she was Ethiopian of Eritrean  background.   There  was  a  lot  of
    anecdotal evidence and claims that there had been rejections.   It  was
    hardly surprising given that she had  been  told  to  go  the  Eritrean
    Embassy and she had only spoken to the receptionist.  As Mr Fripp said,
    she had done this for the purpose of the litigation only and there  had
    been no point in going earlier for the reasons he gave.  The  appellant
    said that she was at risk of persecution on the grounds of  deprivation
    of nationality, so why had she not  asked  for  the  passport  she  was
    entitled to months ago?  Whatever the Home Office said,  she  had  said
    she was Ethiopian all along.

63.  As regards the evidence as to what had  happened  in  Ethiopia  between
    the 1990s and 2000, Ms Giovannetti accepted that there was  some  risk,
    at some point in the past, of arbitrary deprivation of nationality.  On
    the evidence properly analysed, even that had been  a  low  risk.   The
    most helpful  document  was  the  Commission  report.   Ms  Giovannetti
    referred to the relevant paragraphs in that  report.   With  regard  to
    dual nationals they had been accepted as being of Eritrean  nationality
    also.  Though the standard of proof  employed  by  the  Commission  was
    high, if read as a whole it was quite clear that there were areas where
    the Commission had felt that the evidence simply did  not  come  up  to
    proof, for example at paragraph  72,  and  paragraph  157  was  another
    example of this.  The erroneous identification of individuals  was  not
    the same  as  an  arbitrary  process  done  simply  because  of  family
    background.  The references in this regard in EB  at  paragraph  5  and
    also at paragraph 75 of the Commission report were relevant.  Paragraph
    75 did not deal with people in the  appellant's  position  but  "yellow
    card" people.  The appellant had had nothing to do with the  referendum
    so that had no bearing on this case.  So a possible risk  of  erroneous
    deprivation of nationality in the past for the appellant was not a real
    one as she would not have been someone likely to be deported.  It would
    have been arbitrary had it happened and currently she  was  a  de  jure
    Ethiopian national and there was no evidence of a real risk of  refusal
    as such, as long as she cooperated in the  process.   If  she  did  not
    cooperate then  she  would  perhaps  be  refused  an  emergency  travel
    document.  She had held an Ethiopian passport before, as could be  seen
    from  Dr  Hoyle's  determination  where  he  had  simply  recorded  her
    evidence.

64.  Mr Fripp said that it was accepted that the appellant had travelled  on
    an Ethiopian passport in her name but he was told it had been  obtained
    for her by an agent and it had been used for exit  from  Ethiopia.   It
    was not  conceded  that  she  necessarily  had  an  Ethiopian  passport
    properly issued and it was known that it was not issued to her.

65.  Ms Giovannetti argued that there was  no  acceptable  evidence  that  a
    person with an Eritrean family background in Ethiopia  was  persecuted,
    unlike the situation in EB where there had been  previous  persecution.
    She referred to the Operational Guidance Note  at  pages  112  to  113,
    paragraphs 3.82, 3.83 and 3.88.  Mr Fripp had not taken the Tribunal to
    any evidence showing that a person of an Eritrean family background was
    currently at risk in Ethiopia.  His case was essentially that there was
    ill-treatment some years ago and the general human rights situation  in
    Ethiopia  was  problematic  and  there  were   reports   of   increased
    Ethiopian/Eritrean tension as seen in Mr Barnes' evidence and what  the
    BBC said, but with regard to the former that had been a year earlier so
    it was nothing new and  not  a  real  risk  and  it  was  a  matter  of
    speculation only.  The  Commission  report  was  at  the  heart  of  Ms
    Giovannetti's submissions.  The  Commission  had  reviewed  a  mass  of
    evidence, having set out the evidence it reviewed  at  page  8.   Human
    rights  organisations  sometimes  were  less  than  critical  in  their
    approach.  Especial weight should be attached to  this  report.   There
    must have been a lot of documentation and evidence from a lot of people
    on both sides.  By contrast the evidence of  the  experts  provided  on
    behalf of the appellant was largely anecdotal.

66.  The  ambit  of  the  2004  Directive  was  not  really  central  to  Ms
    Giovannetti's case.  She accepted what was said by Mr  Barnes  that  it
    was unclear what the ambit of the  Directive  was.   On  the  continued
    residence point this was referred to under the heading  of  "objective"
    and it was unclear if that defined the effect of the Directive.  On its
    words it was capable of applying to people such as the appellant.   But
    in any event it was argued on behalf of the Secretary of State that the
    appellant did not need to reapply for nationality as she had  not  been
    deprived of it.  Mr Fripp accepted that she was an  Ethiopian  national
    though his argument was that there was nothing to  justify  application
    of the law denying her.  The appellant had not  lost  her  nationality.
    The lack of documentation did not preclude her meeting the requirements
    of Ethiopian nationality law.  Even if she could not, it would  not  be
    arbitrary but it would be justified and legitimate.  It would mean that
    they could not be satisfied that she was an Ethiopian national.

67.  As regards the  reference  to  GH,  the  situation  in  that  case  was
    different as there were practical problems preventing return which were
    nothing to do with actions by the receiving state.  It was not  a  case
    of a refusal, but of  obstacles  and  dangers.   So  it  would  not  be
    appropriate to leave out the difficulties of return, the  question  was
    what would happen if the appellant got there.  It was not enough  if  a
    person could not get a passport  but  they  would  also  need  to  show
    persecution on return.  GH was  mainly  directed  to  the  question  of
    whether the mechanics or route of return would put a person at risk, in
    contrast to this case.  Ms Giovannetti agreed with Mr Fripp that it had
    little bearing on this case.  As regards the pure hypothetical approach
    which had been touched on in EB, it was suggested  by  Longmore  LJ  at
    paragraph 70 that it was not necessary to  look  at  the  situation  on
    return  but  at  paragraph  71  there  was  the  key  question  of  the
    hypothetical approach and this was a difficult decision  to  understand
    in this regard.  Paragraph 75 perhaps had to be read in  the  light  of
    the earlier paragraphs in Longmore LJ's judgment as to why  deprivation
    of nationality was usually persecution, and  therefore  the  court  had
    looked at whether there were clear findings of arbitrary deprivation of
    citizenship.  The reasoning was brief as the court  had  decided  there
    was past persecution.

68.  The appellant was a de jure Ethiopian  national  and  on  the  evidence
    before the Tribunal there was nothing to show any substantial risk that
    the Ethiopian authorities would refuse to  acknowledge  that  in  a  de
    facto sense.  If she cooperated she would be recognised as  a  national
    by the Ethiopian authorities in the United Kingdom, and  there  was  no
    reason to  believe  it  would  be  different  on  return.   The  purely
    hypothetical approach was not urged on the Tribunal but it should  make
    findings of fact as to whether the evidence demonstrated a practice  of
    arbitrary  refusal  of  recognition  of  nationality  of  an  Ethiopian
    national of Eritrean background, in the United Kingdom.   It  would  be
    risky to adopt the purely hypothetical approach given what was said  in
    EB.  EB focussed on the real not hypothetical chance of deprivation  of
    nationality and that was the proper  approach  for  the  Tribunal.   As
    regards what was said in Mr Fripp's skeleton about IK and the  question
    of whether a person was expected to lie at interview, it was  a  matter
    of the Tribunal having to predict what an individual would say or do if
    asked, and Mr Fripp might say that a  lot  could  depend  on  what  the
    appellant said about her husband's background etcetera.  There  was  no
    material to show that this would be determinative at all, even  if  she
    told the truth, but in any event her case was not that her  nationality
    would not be recognised on account of her links with her  husband,  but
    that she had been or would be deprived of  her  nationality  on  ethnic
    grounds.  The only relevant question was whether  she  would  tell  the
    truth about her parents'  nationality  and  equally  as  to  where  her
    husband was born and whether he was Eritrean.  There  was  no  evidence
    that what she said would make any difference.

69.  As to the question of what  rights  non-Ethiopian  nationals  who  were
    Eritrean would have, if the Tribunal agreed with Mr Fripp that the 2004
    Directive only applied to continuing  residents,  then  Ms  Giovannetti
    argued that the Tribunal should find that there was no clear  evidence.
    There was however the reference at paragraph 3.8.2, which had to  be  a
    reference to people who did not come within that interpretation of  the
    Directive, as they had been repatriated.  Mr  Barnes  and  others  said
    there were no  reports  of  ill-treatment  of  Ethiopians  of  Eritrean
    background.  That was not the same as saying they possessed a bundle of
    rights, but what was said in EB and the bundle of rights that went with
    citizenship should be borne in mind.  There was no  evidence  that  the
    appellant would be able to vote in such circumstances or get  a  travel
    document to come and go, insofar as those were central.  There  was  no
    evidence that she would not be able to work or  access  state  benefits
    and it should be questioned whether what she would be  denied  amounted
    to persecution or serious harm.

70.  The respondent's case was not  however  put  on  that  basis.   It  was
    argued that she would get a travel document and would not be treated as
    a non-Ethiopian.  If she cooperated, her de jure nationality  would  be
    recognised and she would go back as such.  There was no evidence as  to
    how she would get a passport, but nationality being recognised helped.

71.  Mr Fripp clarified that he was not saying that  if  the  appellant  was
    recognised de facto as an Ethiopian national and  returned,  she  would
    per se face a relevant risk on return or thereafter.

72.  Ms Giovannetti referred to what was said in the OGN about  evidence  of
    returns from Sudan  and  Eritrea  of  people  of  Eritrean  origins  to
    Ethiopia.  She argued that that together with  the  Directive  and  the
    2003 document tended to show a far more positive approach on  the  part
    of the Ethiopian authorities to people of Eritrean  family  background.
    There was a consistent increase in recognition of rights  and  openness
    to returnees.

73.  By way of reply, Mr Fripp addressed first of  all  paragraph  3.8.2  of
    the OGN.  The appellant was not an Ethiopian facing adverse  action  in
    Eritrea.  As regards paragraph 3.8.3, it  was  difficult  to  see  from
    where the Eritreans referred to  were  being  repatriated  and  it  was
    assumed it was from Eritrea.  He agreed with Ms Giovannetti that  there
    was no need to consider hypothetical return though it had been done  by
    the Court of Appeal in EB in  a  belt  and  braces  way.   A  de  facto
    deprivation was the basis, and paragraphs 71 and 75  in  that  decision
    were important.  Regard should be had to the decision in Lazarevic  and
    to the Canadian cases referred to in his  skeleton.   A  person  denied
    nationality who nevertheless had every  benefit  of  a  national  would
    nevertheless  be  suffering  from  persecution.   That  would  not   be
    persecutory in itself, but the nature of the deprivation had to make it
    persecutory and there were questions of process and legality and it was
    not a matter of consequences.  It was very  extreme  but  probably  the
    answer was no.  The majority in EB had not wanted to go on and consider
    hypothetical returns.  Insofar as they did, once the prior findings had
    been reached, they were able to deal with it quite swiftly.   The  pure
    hypothetical approach was inconsistent with EB and the case  law  cited
    there and it would be an error of law to  base  the  decision  on  that
    approach.  EB should be treated as a starting  point.   Paragraphs  51,
    54, 56, 61, 63, 66, 67, 70 and 75 were of particular relevance.  It was
    necessary to contrast the facts in EB with those of the  instant  case.
    In EB the appellant had come to the United Kingdom in the  early  2000s
    whereas the appellant in the instant appeal had arrived during the  war
    when deportations  etcetera  were  being  actively  instituted  by  the
    Ethiopian state.  She had had every reason  to  believe  that  she  was
    identified and had been told she was being looked for with  a  view  to
    deportation.  Her background was consistent with that of a person being
    targeted at the time.  That continued to the present position.  It  was
    not argued  that  every  Ethiopian  of  Eritrean  ethnicity  faced  the
    relevant risk, but Ms Giovannetti had said nothing to show the  present
    situation was not as  it  had  been  put  by  the  appellant.   It  was
    necessary to look at the past and  reference  was  made  to  the  Human
    Rights Watch report at E2 page 18, especially page 19.  The  Commission
    report on this and on the Human  Rights  Watch  Reports  was  relevant.
    Some NGOs, for example Human Rights Watch  and  Amnesty  International,
    depended on their credibility and they would be very careful as to what
    they said.  They did not have the limited mandate or high  standard  of
    proof of the Commission and also had a broader  basis  of  submissions.
    Page 20 at paragraph 2 and also page 26 on the Commission  report  were
    referred to.  Expellees had not been permitted to return and  therefore
    the government policy had been discriminatory in  1998  and  there  was
    also a UNHCR letter cited at paragraph 31 in  EB.   Deportees  had  not
    been allowed to return by 2003.  Family members had been picked out.

74.  The 2004 Directive reinforced the de facto  position.   Some  Eritreans
    had gone to Eritrea, and others  to  third  countries  and  others  had
    remained.  The state was aware of this when the Directive was  drafted,
    and hence its ambit.  The statement of policy was not ambiguous, having
    been made by the SIRAA Director.  There was no evidence of any  apology
    by Ethiopia.  Before the Commission it had  defended  its  position  as
    consistent with its own nationality law.  The Commission had  concluded
    that there were significant breaches.  There had been  no  response  by
    the embassy to correspondence from both sides,  and  this  demonstrated
    the pattern.  The  appellant  was  a  member  of  the  group  that  had
    attracted  adverse  attention  between  1998  and  2002.   A  universal
    practice did not have to be shown.  A critical factor was  the  adverse
    attention she attracted between 1998 and 1999.  It was clear  that  she
    was within the potentially affected group in 1998 and, even if not  so,
    there was a lot of room for the inference that her departure  when  she
    left would be seen as an implicit admission of being an alien.

75.  It was  true  that  there  was  no  identified  provision  under  which
    nationality was lost, and it was common ground that  she  had  de  jure
    entitlement to nationality,  but  de  facto  there  was  a  history  of
    victimisation  and  exclusion  affecting  a  lot  of  people  and  this
    penetrated even to the IOM's evidence.  These were self-selecting cases
    involving  people  who  had  volunteered  to  return,  and  the  sample
    reflected that.  There was no evidence of how many cases  the  IOM  had
    dealt with.  Ethiopia had not been identified  as  a  main  country  to
    which returns were assisted.  A lot of the people the IOM helped seemed
    to be from those top few states.  Sylvia  Rosenbaum's  email  reflected
    the  embassy's  attitude  where  there  was  evidence  of  an  Eritrean
    background and was linked to the BBC evidence concerning  the  risk  of
    renewal of the war.  Until the hearing before the IAT, the Secretary of
    State had persisted in intending to return to Eritrea.   The  appellant
    was not stamped with the nationality the Secretary of  State  initially
    decided on, but it showed the relevance of the Eritrean connection.  Mr
    Ajeti's second communication was significant.

76.  It was unclear how many of the 166 Ethiopian  cases  referred  to  were
    relevant claims.  The reference to Chen was not appropriate as it was a
    very  different  situation.    There   was   continuous   evidence   of
    discrimination  against  the  appellant's  group  for  some  time.   Ms
    Giovannetti emphasised attendance at interview by  the  appellant,  but
    she was of Eritrean background.  It was the case that she had said  all
    along she was Ethiopian but there were two parties and there was  scope
    for confusion where there were divisions  between  nationality  in  the
    international and national senses.   The  appellant  did  not  consider
    herself to be Eritrean.  The finding by the Commission that  there  had
    been a few errors suggested  a  lot  more  errors  on  a  more  liberal
    standard of proof.  The position for dual nationals was different.  The
    IOM evidence showed that some lines were being drawn not on  the  basis
    of de jure entitlement and  if  that  was  being  applied  by  Ethiopia
    together with the additional restraints that seemed to attach weight to
    whether people wanted to go to Ethiopia as  the  IOM  evidence  showed.
    The appellant had good reasons  not  to  go  to  Ethiopia.   There  was
    nothing to say that what was said by Mr  Barnes  at  page  62  did  not
    extend to the class affected by arbitrary selection  after  1998.   The
    appellant was not  in  the  same  position  as  a  person  of  Eritrean
    ethnicity continuously resident in Ethiopia.

77.  Ms Giovannetti clarified that since the appellant was not  an  Eritrean
    national, then on her argument the Directive was not relevant.

78.  Mr Fripp said that his main point was that the  Directive  showed  that
    it was limited to the people who had remained in Ethiopia and there had
    been a lot of deportations and resettlement and that it was limited  to
    the untargeted.  As regards the ARC card this was not Mr  Fripp's  best
    point as the Home Office could adjust it, as had been said, and he  did
    not seek to hang anything on it.  On the appellant's history  it  would
    come to light as it identified her.

79.  We reserved our determination.

Discussion

80.   As  can  be  seen  from  the  summary  of  the  submissions  above,  a
    significant aspect of the argument before  us  concerned  the  contrast
    between de jure and de facto nationality.  Since de  facto  nationality
    is not nationality as a legal fact, we see only limited value  to  this
    distinction.  Nevertheless this terminology serves a useful purpose  in
    demarcating a two stage approach which is helpful in cases such as this
    where there is an issue as to whether persecution or serious harm  will
    arise from a state's attitude to a  person's  nationality  or  lack  of
    nationality.

The Issue of De Jure Nationality (Stage 1)

81.   In  any  case  of  disputed  nationality  the  first  question  to  be
    considered should be "Is the person a de jure national of  the  country
    concerned?"  That is a necessary element of the definition of a refugee
    contained in Article 1A(2) of the Refugee Convention and is exclusively
    a legal question.  This question is to be answered by examining whether
    a person fulfils  the  nationality  law  requirements  of  his  or  her
    country.  The ways in  which  nationality  must  be  assessed  are  the
    subject of guidance given by the Tribunal in Smith (00/TH/02130), where
    the Tribunal considered that a hierarchical  approach  to  evidence  on
    nationality was not appropriate, disagreeing with what had been said in
    Tikhonov (V0052; 17 July 1998) and commenting that the approach in that
    case took too far reliance on rules of evidence  and  proof  which  had
    been forged in non-refugee law contexts, the  context  of  conflict  of
    laws and the United Kingdom  immigration  and  nationality  context  in
    particular.   Thus  relevant   documentation,   the   appellant's   own
    testimony, agreement between the parties, Foreign  Office  letters  and
    the text of nationality laws, as well as  expert  evidence,  could  all
    legitimately inform the assessment.

82.  That having been said, however, it may be relevant,  in  deciding  what
    is the legal answer to be given, to examine evidence regarding what the
    authorities in the appellant's country of origin have done  in  respect
    of an individual's nationality; thus there may be questions of  whether
    they have issued a passport or whether, as was the  case  in  EB,  they
    have taken steps to deprive the appellant of the documentary  means  of
    proving nationality.

83.  What  is  concerned  in  determining  whether  a  person  has  de  jure
    nationality is essentially the question of whether they plainly  fulfil
    the mandatory criteria  governing,  for  example,  the  acquisition  of
    nationality by birth and/or parentage.   In  such  cases  it  would  be
    irrelevant  whether  the  person  holds  documents   confirming   their
    nationality.  However, where the eligibility  for  nationality  depends
    upon discretionary criteria under the nationality laws of that country,
    providing, for example, for naturalisation depending upon such  matters
    as character, conduct, long residence or other  similar  grounds,  then
    the question of whether or not they could  take  (or  have  taken)  the
    appropriate steps to obtain nationality will be of relevance.  To  that
    extent, the previous case  law  of  the  Tribunal,  which  affirms  the
    importance of a claimant taking reasonable steps, remains  valid  since
    in such cases the  answer  to  the  legal  question  depends  upon  the
    exercise by the country concerned of discretion under  its  nationality
    laws.

84.  If the answer to the question of de jure nationality  is  that  it  has
    not been shown that the person is a de jure  national  of  the  country
    concerned, then they will either be a national of  another  country  or
    will be stateless.  If the latter, but they are a person for  whom  the
    country concerned is their country of former habitual  residence,  then
    the same analysis  as  is  set  out  below  with  regard  to  de  facto
    nationality will have to be carried out.

The De Facto Nationality Issue (Stage 2)

85.  If it is concluded that the  person  is  a  de  jure  national  of  the
    country concerned then the next question to be considered is the purely
    factual question, i.e. "Is it reasonably likely that the authorities of
    the state concerned will accept the person concerned if returned as one
    of its own  nationals?"   This  is  the  hypothetical  approach,  which
    focuses exclusively on the person's position upon  return.   That  this
    approach was approved by the Court of Appeal can be seen from paragraph
    71 of EB in the judgment of Longmore LJ.

86.  At the outset we consider that if the person is  a  de  jure  national,
    there is a presumption that the country concerned will afford  him  the
    same treatment as any other national.  Following on from this,  it  may
    also be presumed that the person concerned will  have  obtained  travel
    documentation to enable them to be returned.   If  it  transpires  that
    they cannot in fact obtain such documentation, then they  will  not  be
    returned and therefore no refoulement issues will arise in  any  event.
    Disputes concerning such matters may arise on judicial review  (in  the
    context of the enforcement  of  removal  directions)  or  under  asylum
    support legislation relating to whether a person has  taken  reasonable
    steps to obtain travel documentation, but they are not normally part of
    the jurisdiction of this Tribunal, though, as was suggested  by  Hooper
    LJ in AG and Others v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2006]
    EWCA Civ 1342 at paragraph 123, in a country guidance case it may  well
    be helpful for all concerned to know the dangers inherent in  a  method
    of return that is likely to be used, if known, since these dangers  can
    then inform the Secretary of State when or if  removal  directions  are
    made.

The Appellant's Case

87.  Turning to the appeal before us, in the course of argument  it  emerged
    that it was common ground that the appellant is de  jure  an  Ethiopian
    national.  She qualified as a  national  of  Ethiopia  under  the  1995
    Constitution by reason of her birth in Ethiopia.  Article 33(1) of  the
    Ethiopian Constitution provides that no  Ethiopian  national  shall  be
    deprived of his or her nationality against his  or  her  will.   It  is
    provided at Article 17 of Proclamation  number  378/2003  on  Ethiopian
    nationality (repealing the Ethiopian Nationality Law of 1930)  that  no
    Ethiopian may be deprived of his nationality by  the  decision  of  any
    government authority unless he loses his  Ethiopian  nationality  under
    Article 19 or Article 20.  Article 19 is concerned with renunciation of
    Ethiopian nationality, which may  be  done  by  an  Ethiopian  who  has
    acquired or has been guaranteed the acquisition of the  nationality  of
    another state, and Article 20  is  concerned  with  loss  of  Ethiopian
    nationality, the acquisition of other nationality.   It  has  not  been
    contended that either of these Articles applies to the appellant.

88.  It was said by the majority in EB that if the appellant  in  that  case
    had been deprived of her citizenship by the arbitrary action  of  state
    employees that would prima facie have been persecution within the terms
    of the Refugee Convention.  The reasons for this were said by  Longmore
    LJ, with whom Jacob LJ agreed, to be as follows:-

        "67.  The reason is that, if a state by executive action deprives a
             citizen of her citizenship, that does away with that  citizen's
             individual rights which attach  to  her  citizenship.   One  of
             those most basic rights is to  be  able  freely  to  leave  and
             freely to re-enter one's country.  (There may  well  be  others
             such as the right to  vote.)   Different  considerations  might
             arise if citizens were deprived of their  nationality  by  duly
             constituted legislation  or  proper  judicial  decision  but  a
             deprivation by executive action will almost always be arbitrary
             and, if EB had in fact been deprived of her citizenship by  the
             removal of her identity documents by  state  agents,  it  would
             certainly have been arbitrary."

89.  In that case the Tribunal had found that armed  police  had  taken  the
    appellant's ID cards and school  papers  and  also  identity  documents
    including her birth certificate had  been  removed  and  had  not  been
    returned.  The Tribunal  also  found  that  such  removal  of  identity
    documents was specifically directed at people such as EB  so  that  she
    would have difficulty in future in proving her  Ethiopian  nationality.
    The Tribunal followed MA (the earlier decision of the IAT in this case)
    where it was said "There must be other treatment [in addition  to  loss
    of nationality] which would lead to  persecution",  and  the  Court  of
    Appeal in EB commented that there the Tribunal appeared to have  failed
    to have regard to the consequences of  effective  loss  of  citizenship
    which may amount to persecution.  Longmore LJ at paragraph 70 commented
    that the Tribunal in MA was in his view wrong  to  conclude  that  some
    further (presumably physical) ill-treatment was required.  It  was  the
    arbitrary nature of the state employees'  actions  which  distinguished
    the case from Revenko v SSHD [2001] QB 601.

90.  It is clear  that  the  facts  in  the  case  before  us  are  somewhat
    different from those in EB, since there has  been  no  removal  of  the
    appellant's documents.  The only relevant document that appears to have
    been referred to is the appellant's passport which, as we have set  out
    above from the determination of Dr Hoyle, was described by her as being
    a valid Ethiopian passport in her name which  was  kept  by  the  agent
    after he brought her to the United Kingdom.  Mr Fripp, as we have seen,
    did not  concede  that  the  appellant  necessarily  had  an  Ethiopian
    passport properly issued.  He said that it was known that  it  was  not
    issued to her.  That does not however emerge from her  evidence  before
    Dr Hoyle.  There she is noted as having said that she had an  Ethiopian
    passport and that she had left Ethiopia with a valid Ethiopian passport
    in her name.  There was no reference to the basis  upon  which  it  was
    obtained.  In any event the most important aspect of this is  that  the
    appellant had what she said was a valid Ethiopian passport in her name.
     It was not taken from her by the authorities and nor  indeed  was  any
    other material documentation and that, as we say, is a clear  point  of
    distinction between this case and the situation in EB.

91.  Otherwise, in the context of the hypothetical  approach,  both  counsel
    attached significant weight to  the  report  of  the  Commission.   The
    Ethiopia-Eritrea  Claims  Commission  was  established   and   operates
    pursuant to Article 5 of the agreement signed in Algiers on 12 December
    2000 between the governments of the State of Eritrea  and  the  Federal
    Democratic Republic of Ethiopia.  The Commission was directed to:-

        "Decide through binding arbitrational claims for  loss,  damage  or
        injury by one  government  against  the  other,  and  by  nationals
        (including both natural and juridical persons) of one party against
        the government of the other party or entities owned  or  controlled
        by the other party that are (a) related to the  conflict  that  was
        the subject of the Framework  Agreement,  the  Modalities  for  its
        Implementation and the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement, and  (b)
        result from violations of international humanitarian law, including
        the 1949 Geneva Conventions, or other violations  of  international
        law."

92.  There were five members of the  Commission,  the  President,  and  four
    other members, two appointed by Ethiopia and two appointed by  Eritrea.
    It was common  ground  before  us  that  they  were  all  distinguished
    international arbitration specialists.  The claims in question  covered
    expellees, civilian  detainees  and  "persons  of  Eritrean  extraction
    living in Ethiopia" and were brought to the Commission by the State  of
    Eritrea against the Federal Democratic Republic of  Ethiopia  in  which
    the claimant asked the Commission to find  the  respondent  liable  for
    loss, damage and injury it suffered, including loss, damage and  injury
    suffered by Eritrean nationals and a large  number  of  other  persons,
    resulting  from  alleged  infractions  of  international  law  in   the
    treatment of civilian Eritrean nationals and other persons by  Ethiopia
    in connection with the 1998 - 2000 international armed conflict between
    the two parties.  It is relevant to  note  that  at  paragraph  35  the
    Commission stated that as in the parties' prior case  it  had  required
    proof of liability by clear and  convincing  evidence  and  that  as  a
    consequence conflicting yet credible evidence had perhaps  resulted  in
    fewer findings of unlawful acts than either party might have  expected.
    With regard to Eritrea's claim  for  deprivation  of  nationality,  the
    Commission at paragraph 62  noted  that  the  evidence  indicated  that
    Ethiopia appeared to have made at least a few errors in the process  of
    its determination of whether  or  not  its  nationals  or  any  of  its
    nationals had acquired Eritrean nationality.  There is a  section  from
    paragraph 65 onwards concerned with dual nationals  deprived  of  their
    Ethiopian nationality and expelled for security reasons.  It is said at
    paragraph 66 that Ethiopia said it did not  view  Eritrean  nationality
    alone as sufficient to deem anyone a security threat subject to loss of
    nationality and expulsion, but that additional  ties  or  actions  were
    required, indicating a possible threat to Ethiopia's security, and  the
    principal indicators were such matters as raising money  on  behalf  of
    Eritrea or participating in organisations promoting Eritrean government
    interests or encouraging closer links between expatriate Eritreans  and
    Eritrea.  The overall structure and direction of  the  security  effort
    was the responsibility of Ethiopia's national security  agency,  SIRAA.
    At paragraph 72 the Commission made the point that  Ethiopia  faced  an
    exceptional situation since it was at war with Eritrea,  and  thousands
    of Ethiopians with personal and ethnic ties to Eritrea had taken  steps
    to acquire Eritrean nationality.  Some of these participated in  groups
    that supported the Eritrean government and often acted on  its  behalf.
    In  response  Ethiopia  devised  and  implemented  a  system   applying
    reasonable criteria to identify individual dual  nationals  thought  to
    pose threats to it or its  wartime  security.   Given  the  exceptional
    wartime circumstances, the Commission found that the loss of  Ethiopian
    nationality  after  being  identified  through  this  process  was  not
    arbitrary and contrary to international law, and  Eritrea's  claims  in
    this regard were rejected.

93.  We do not agree with Mr Fripp that these findings  should  be  regarded
    with some scepticism given the high standard of  proof  employed.   The
    remarks at paragraph 72 would be  equally  applicable  in  a  situation
    where the standard of proof was one of real risk.  The comments seem to
    us to be entirely appropriate comments on a  particular  situation  for
    the reasons given, and we do not consider that any less  weight  should
    be attached to the Commission's findings in this regard on  account  of
    the standard of proof employed.  We accept that, as was pointed out  by
    Ms Giovannetti, the appellant was not a person who  was  liable  to  be
    deported since she was not a person who had taken part in the  Eritrean
    independence referendum, and therefore the strictures of the Commission
    concerning Ethiopia's actions in that regard would never  have  applied
    to the appellant.  She would not have been  a  yellow  card  person  as
    discussed in paragraph 75 of the Commission's report.   She  would  not
    have been required to register, because she had not taken part  in  the
    Eritrean independence referendum.

94.  It was suggested that the appellant had been told that she was at  risk
    of deportation.  The Commission considered the issue of family  members
    who were expelled after being identified  through  Ethiopia's  security
    process.  The evidence was not clear regarding the nationality of  many
    family members and it was mixed also  regarding  the  circumstances  of
    family members of departers.  It did indicate that some family  members
    were forcibly expelled, and, to the extent that family members who  did
    not hold  Eritrean  nationality  were  expelled,  the  expulsions  were
    contrary to international law.  Given the limitations of  the  evidence
    however, the Commission could not determine the extent  to  which  this
    occurred.  It is important to note the  conclusion  that  Ethiopia  was
    liable to Eritrea for, among other  things,  erroneously  depriving  at
    least some Ethiopians who were not dual nationals  of  their  Ethiopian
    nationality.

95.  This is of course relevant to the issue of the likely treatment of  the
    appellant now, her de jure nationality  having  been  established.   Ms
    Giovannetti emphasised that at best the appellant could show  that  she
    might  have  been  faced  with  a  risk  of  arbitrary  deprivation  of
    nationality at some point in the past.  That at least must be right  in
    the light of what the Commission found.  But it is important to look to
    the present and to bear in mind in this regard, as Ms Giovannetti  also
    reminded us, that there is no identifiable provision of  Ethiopian  law
    under which the appellant could have lost her nationality  and  nor  is
    there any identifiable executive or administrative act  to  the  effect
    that she is not an Ethiopian national.

96.  We have been provided with a copy  of  the  2004  Directive  Issued  to
    Determine the  Residence  Status  of  Eritrean  Nationals  Residing  in
    Ethiopia, and it is considered in some detail at 6.5 of Cedric  Barnes'
    report, which also quotes a number of provisions of the Directive.  Its
    object is stated to be to enable persons of Eritrean origin,  who  were
    resident in Ethiopia when Eritrea became an  independent  state  [1993]
    and continued to maintain a permanent residence in Ethiopia up  to  the
    issuing of  the  Directive,  to  confirm  whether  they  have  acquired
    Eritrean nationality, and determine their residence status in Ethiopia.
     The Directive notes that no Ethiopian shall be deprived of his or  her
    nationality according to Article 33(1) of the  Ethiopian  Constitution,
    though the government can deprive individuals of their  nationality  if
    they lose their nationality through their own will.  Section 4.2 of the
    Directive provides that a person of Eritrean origin who has  not  opted
    for Eritrean nationality shall be deemed as having decided to  maintain
    his or her Ethiopian nationality and his or her  Ethiopian  nationality
    shall be guaranteed.

97.  We turn next to consider the relevance to the appellant's case of  what
    was said by the experts in their  various  reports.   Professor  Lionel
    Cliffe, who is an Emeritus Professor of Politics in the  University  of
    Leeds,  provided  a  main  report  of  11  January  2007  and  also   a
    supplementary report.  In the first report he expresses the  view  that
    the appellant is in  a  position  where  she  has  lost  her  right  of
    citizenship.  He quotes a statement to be found in the  COI  Report  on
    Ethiopia for 2006 at paragraph 6.125 that people who had not voted  for
    Eritrean independence in the 1993 referendum and had lived in  Ethiopia
    uninterrupted would be granted permanent Ethiopian citizenship but this
    would be terminated, among other circumstances, if they stayed  out  of
    Ethiopia for more than a year and were found undesirable to the nation.
     He also quotes paragraph  6.126  to  the  effect  that  the  right  to
    citizenship could only benefit those who lived in Ethiopia permanently,
    and that this reading  of  the  2004  Directive  was  supported  by  an
    authority  quoted  by  Cedric  Barnes  who  had   provided   a   report
    commissioned by the UNHCR in May 2006.  He also  quotes  the  Ethiopian
    Director of Immigration and Nationalities Authority, Girma Balcha, that
    the recently issued Directive will benefit only Eritreans who lived  in
    Ethiopia  permanently  and  that  the  Directive,  and  especially  its
    provisions for Eritreans reacquiring Ethiopian  citizenship,  does  not
    apply to Eritreans who  were  expelled  after  the  war  began  nor  to
    Eritreans coming from another country.  He states that he has not heard
    of a single case where someone with  Eritrean  origins  who  considered
    herself or himself an Ethiopian citizenship [sic] was in  fact  granted
    citizenship by the embassy.

98.  In his supplementary report, which is undated, Professor Cliffe  refers
    to the Claims  Commission  report  and  the  2003  Proclamation,  which
    repealed the former citizenship law and clarified that those  who  were
    of Ethiopian parentage  were  Ethiopian,  but  also  provided  for  the
    acquisition  of  citizenship  through  application,  a   right   which,
    according to the legal provisions, would have  been  available  to  the
    claimant if she were still in the country.  It also seemed  that  under
    such provisions someone who had been out of the country could make such
    an application.  However  he  considers  that  the  provisions  of  the
    Directive of 2004 make that prospect unlikely.  He refers to  the  fact
    that certain sections of that seem to confer Ethiopian  citizenship  on
    anyone born there of Eritrean origins who did  not  specifically  claim
    Eritrean citizenship and that might seem to apply to the claimant.   He
    considers however that  certain  stipulations  and  interpretations  by
    officials, cited in paragraph 4 of the first report,  strongly  suggest
    that those who have not  remained  resident  are  precluded  from  this
    eligibility.  He refers to the interpretation of the Directive  in  the
    UNHCR document where it is said that it appears to infer that rights to
    Ethiopian citizenship of those expelled before the 2004 Directive  were
    not recognised by the Directive, would clearly apply  to  someone  like
    the appellant's husband, but not explicitly to someone in her  position
    of leaving the country.  He considers however that there  is  a  strong
    implication that it is likely to be interpreted to exclude her and that
    that conclusion is supported by evidence that seems to indicate that in
    the actual practice of applying for the right to confirm or reapply for
    citizenship, through such avenues as the Ethiopian Embassy  in  London,
    any applicant with any Eritrean connections is  routinely  denied  that
    right to apply and therefore all people  from  Ethiopia  with  Eritrean
    origins  seem  in  effect  to  be  denied  entitlement   to   Ethiopian
    citizenship.  Accordingly, it seems that  Professor  Cliffe's  view  as
    expressed in the latest statement is that though the appellant may,  as
    we have noted above was common ground before us, have de jure Ethiopian
    citizenship, but it is not likely to have de facto citizenship.

99.  Herr G�nther Schr�der has provided a report dated 11 March 2007.   Herr
    Schr�der is by training an historian and social anthropologist who  has
    been working for many years as an independent researcher and consultant
    and has made regular visits to Eritrea and Ethiopia.  Having considered
    the background situation in some detail, Herr Schr�der  comments  first
    that since the appellant had never applied for an Eritrean national  ID
    card or in any other way exercised the Eritrean  nationality  conferred
    upon her by the Eritrean nationality law of 1992 she had not  given  up
    her Ethiopian citizenship.  However he considered that by  listing  her
    for deportation to Eritrea the Ethiopian authorities treated her  as  a
    "hostile Eritrean national" and thus  deprived  her  de  facto  of  her
    Ethiopian citizenship.  As she managed to escape deportation  and  make
    her way to the United Kingdom, she is in a position where  she  has  de
    facto lost her right of Ethiopian citizenship not only through the past
    actions of the Ethiopian government against her but also  according  to
    the 2004 Directive and  the  current  administrative  practice  of  the
    Ethiopian authorities within Ethiopia and abroad.  If she succeeded  in
    returning to Ethiopia in any other way  but  through  being  officially
    reinstated into her Ethiopian  citizenship  she  would  only  have  the
    option of acquiring Ethiopian  citizenship  documents  by  "unofficial"
    ways and that would expose her, in the case of being uncovered, to  the
    serious risk of being labelled as an illegal "Eritrean  national".   He
    also  considers  that  even  if  she  were  readmitted   to   Ethiopian
    citizenship and  thus  given  the  opportunity  to  return  legally  to
    Ethiopia, she  could  claim  to  be  justifiably  concerned  about  her
    security and life if she were  returned  from  the  United  Kingdom  to
    Ethiopia.  He considers that people  of  Eritrean  descent  have  every
    reason to be distrustful of the Ethiopian  government  given  the  past
    experiences, and that though Ethiopia has laws there is still no  well-
    established  rule  of  law  in  Ethiopia,  and   the   government   and
    governmental organs at all levels often apply  the  laws  in  a  highly
    arbitrary manner or openly violate them.  It is said that its  citizens
    and foreign nationals residing within Ethiopia have no real  protection
    against all forms of misuse of state power and human rights  violations
    are still rampant.

100. As regards the evidence of Professor Cliffe, and,  in  particular,  the
    suggestion in his evidence that the rights guaranteed to  Eritreans  in
    possession of residence permits in the 2004  Directive  apply  only  to
    those who were in continued residence in Eritrea up until  the  issuing
    of the Directive, we note that the provision  in  the  Directive,  upon
    which this appears to be based, Article 2, is entitled "objective"  and
    does not purport to define the exclusive scope of the Directive.  It is
    relevant, as Ms Giovannetti argued in her skeleton, to  note  that  the
    Directive thereafter specifically  notes  the  operative  and  relevant
    provisions of the Constitution and of the 2003 Proclamation  which  are
    clearly of  generalised  application.   There  is  no  indication  that
    paragraphs 4 to 6, which relate to registration and  entitlement  to  a
    residence permit, are limited in the way suggested by Professor Cliffe.
     With regard to what Professor Cliffe  says  (and  indeed  to  what  Mr
    Barnes and Herr Schr�der say) with reference to the  remarks  of  Girma
    Balcha,  the  Ethiopian  Director  of   Immigration   and   Nationality
    Authority, the interpretation placed by Mr Balcha does  not  appear  to
    have been promulgated in any official Directive or any  other  official
    document.  It is also, and again we are grateful to Ms Giovannetti  for
    the quotation to this effect in her skeleton,  to  be  contrasted  with
    other reports such as the reference quoted at paragraph  21.44  in  the
    August 2006 COIR from the ruling party-owned Walta Information  Centre,
    that permanent Ethiopian citizenship would be terminated if individuals
    attempted to produce fake documents or stayed outside Ethiopia for more
    than a year and were found undesirable to  the  nation.   There  is  no
    indication that this would apply to the appellant.

101. With regard to Herr Schr�der's evidence, his suggestion of  an  ongoing
    risk of discrimination or persecution for those of Eritrean  origin  is
    essentially supported  by  references  to  the  historic  treatment  of
    Eritreans during war and  generalised  assertions,  rather  than  being
    based on current evidence of such a policy or practice.

102. Taking all the evidence together, we conclude that, responding  to  the
    question that we set out above, that it is reasonably likely  that  the
    authorities of Ethiopia will accept the appellant, if returned, as  one
    of its own nationals.  We therefore dismiss the appeal on all grounds.

103. Though that disposes of the appeal, it will, we think, be  helpful  for
    us to set out the evidence concerning the issue of travel documentation
    and our views on it.

The Issue of Travel Documentation

104.  We  also  have  evidence  from  the  International  Organisation   for
    Migration (IOM).  In the witness statement  of  Anne  Scruton,  of  the
    Border and Immigration Agency as Acting Head of Unit for  the  Assisted
    Voluntary Returns Team (AVR Team), there is reference  to  a  telephone
    call on 13 July with Sylvia Rosenbaum of the IOM who was asked  whether
    the IOM experienced any difficulties  in  obtaining  documentation  for
    Ethiopian nationals, wishing to return to Ethiopia, who had an Eritrean
    family background.  Ms Rosenbaum said that provided the  person  wished
    to return to Ethiopia there should be no problems  with  documentation.
    There is a fax of 17 July 2007 from Besim Ajeti, Head of Operations  of
    the IOM in the United Kingdom, who states that in general terms  if  an
    applicant with an Eritrean family background was born in  Ethiopia  and
    says in the interview that he or she is happy to  return  to  Ethiopia,
    then the embassy is likely to issue a travel document.  It is said that
    even if the person  was  born  in  Ethiopia  they  are  not  considered
    automatically an Ethiopian national.  If they  said  in  the  interview
    they did not wish to go to Ethiopia  the  embassy  would  not  issue  a
    travel document.  Mr Ajeti emphasises that each case is individual  and
    has its own specifics.  Thereafter Mr Ajeti sent a  further  fax  on  3
    September 2007 to Ms Scruton, stating that there  have  been  cases  in
    which people born in  Ethiopia  of  Ethiopian/Eritrean  parentage  were
    given travel documents to return to  Ethiopia  and  other  cases  where
    applicants with the same background were not, either because they  said
    at interview they did not want to  return  to  Ethiopia  or  they  were
    unable to provide supporting documentation concerning  their  right  to
    Ethiopian citizenship.

105. There is also a copy of an email from Sylvia Rosenbaum to Anne  Scruton
    of 15 August 2007 concerning a case of an applicant  born  in  Ethiopia
    with an Eritrean father and Ethiopian mother.  When she claimed  asylum
    in the United Kingdom her nationality was stated as Eritrean on her IND
    card.  She attended an interview at the embassy  and  they  refused  to
    give her  a  travel  document  solely  because  on  the  IND  card  her
    nationality was stated  as  Eritrean.   She  thought  that  this  could
    potentially affect a considerable number of applicants who were in this
    situation.  In the past they had been able to help Eritrean  applicants
    to return to Ethiopia regardless of what is stated on the IND card,  as
    long as they fulfilled the language  and  family  requirements  but  it
    seemed that this would no longer be the case.

106. As can be seen from above we clarified the situation of  the  IND  card
    with the assistance particularly of  Ms  Giovannetti.   It  was  not  a
    matter that Mr Fripp  wished  to  pursue  since,  as  he  realistically
    pointed out, there was nothing to stop the Home Office issuing  to  the
    appellant a new IND card making it clear that her  claimed  nationality
    is Ethiopian.  Mr Fripp also made the point that the  IOM  are  dealing
    only with voluntary  returns,  though  he  did  not  dissent  from  the
    submission of Ms Giovannetti that they are an independent  organisation
    and, from the nature and content of their communications,  are  clearly
    anxious to demonstrate their independence.

107.  Next  there  is  the  evidence  of  Mr  Nigel  Beaumont.   It  was  of
    considerable assistance not only to have Mr Beaumont's  statements  but
    also his oral evidence which clarified  a  number  of  aspects  of  the
    process.  Among other matters he was  able  to  clarify  the  different
    processes which now apply and show  that  in  a  case  where  there  is
    supporting evidence in the form of such matters as a  copy  or  expired
    passport, ID card, birth certificate, etcetera, that an individual  can
    be removed to Ethiopia on a European Union letter.  Such cases  do  not
    require the person to go and be interviewed at the  Ethiopian  Embassy.
    It is, we think, common ground that the appellant does  not  have  such
    documentation.  Otherwise a person such as the appellant would have  to
    be interviewed at the Ethiopian Embassy with perhaps three interviewers
    carrying out the interview, and this would, if successful, lead to  the
    provision of a laissez passer enabling return to Ethiopia.  Mr Beaumont
    provided a list of cases of people, one of whose parents was  Eritrean,
    who had all had emergency travel documentation agreed and in some cases
    a successful removal had taken place.  In one  case,  reference  29985,
    the person in question claimed to be Eritrean.  This person is noted as
    being of Ethiopian nationality, the mother having been born in Ethiopia
    and the father in Eritrea.  It  seems  that  a  copy  of  an  Ethiopian
    passport  was  provided  as  supporting  evidence.   The   person   was
    interviewed by the embassy and an emergency travel document was  issued
    in December 2005  but  a  judicial  review  application  had  thus  far
    prevented removal.

108. In case 37774 there  was  no  supporting  evidence  but  the  bio  data
    indicated an Eritrean father and an Ethiopian mother  and  this  person
    was interviewed by the embassy and an  emergency  travel  document  was
    issued in September 2006 but removal had  been  delayed  following  the
    discovery that the applicant had an Ethiopian wife  and  child  in  the
    United Kingdom, and travel documents were awaited so  the  family  unit
    could be removed at the same time.  There are two other examples, 19944
    and 23145 of cases where there was no supporting evidence but  the  bio
    data indicated in each case an Eritrean and an Ethiopian parent.   Both
    were interviewed or at least it is clear in the form that there was  an
    interview at the embassy, and emergency travel documentation was issued
    in both cases.  In the former case a second judicial review had delayed
    removal but in the latter the appellant was successfully removed on  14
    April 2006.

109. Taking this evidence as a whole, we  conclude  that  a  person  in  the
    appellant's position who does not have relevant documentation to enable
    removal on a European Union letter, and who would be expected to attend
    an interview at the Ethiopian Embassy, where  the  embassy  would  have
    been provided with the bio data information which  in  the  appellant's
    case would show that her parents were born in Eritrea and  she  herself
    was born in Ethiopia, would be  likely  to  be  issued  with  emergency
    travel documentation.  It would seem from the  IOM  evidence  that  she
    would not however be likely to be issued with a travel document by  the
    Ethiopian Embassy if she said in the interview  she  did  not  want  to
    return to Ethiopia.  If she were willing to return then it  would  seem
    that she would be given travel documentation.  In this  regard,  we  do
    not ignore what was said by Girma Balcha (against which however has  to
    be set the actual wording of the 2004 Directive, and what we say  above
    at paragraph 102, and of course we take full account of what  was  said
    by the experts, but we  consider  to  be  particularly  compelling  the
    specific examples that we have been  given  by  Mr  Beaumont,  and  the
    evidence of the IOM.

     Conclusions

110. In cases of disputed nationality, it is  necessary  to  consider  first
    whether the person concerned is a de jure national of  the  country  in
    question.  This essentially involves the need  to  decide  whether  the
    person fulfils the  mandatory  nationality  law  requirements  of  that
    country.  If it is concluded that the person is a de jure  national  of
    the country concerned, it  will  then  be  necessary  to  consider  the
    factual  question  of  whether  it  is  reasonably  likely   that   the
    authorities of the state concerned will accept the person  if  returned
    as one of its own nationals (the hypothetical approach).   There  is  a
    presumption that a de jure national of a country will be  afforded  the
    same treatment as any other national. What we say in this determination
    about the proper approach in cases of  disputed  nationality  supplants
    what  the  Immigration  Appeal  Tribunal  said  on  this  point  in  YL
    (Nationality - statelessness - Eritrea - Ethiopia)  Eritrea  CG  [2003]
    UKIAT 00016.

111. The appellant is a de jure national of Ethiopia.  Taking  the  evidence
    relevant to the hypothetic approach as a  whole,  we  find  that  it  s
    reasonably likely that the authorities of Ethiopia will accept her,  if
    returned, as an Ethiopian national.

112. The appeal is dismissed.
