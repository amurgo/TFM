                      ERROR OF LAW FINDING AND REASONS


     1. This is an appeal against a decision of First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
        Hall promulgated on 29 March 2017.









Background


     2. The appellant is a male citizen of Libya  born  on  [  ]  1976  who
        entered the United Kingdom lawfully as a student  in  January  2013
        with a Visa valid to 26 October 2013.  The  appellant  returned  to
        Libya in October 2013 and re-entered the United Kingdom on 27 March
        2014 as a student with a Visa valid to 15 October 2014,  which  was
        extended to 30 January 2016. On  27  January  2016,  the  appellant
        claimed asylum which was refused by the Secretary of  State  on  21
        July 2016. It is the appeal against that decision which came before
        the Judge.
     3. The Judge considered the  evidence  with  the  required  degree  of
        anxious scrutiny and sets out findings of fact  from  [48]  of  the
        decision under challenge. The Judge accepted the appellant's  claim
        to be a Libyan citizen and his  immigration  history  and  that  an
        explosion occurred in 2015 for which ISIS  claimed  responsibility,
        as asserted by the appellant.
     4. The Judge noted other family members live in different parts within
        Libya but found the appellant not entitled to grant  of  asylum  or
        humanitarian protection  and  that  his  return  would  not  breach
        articles 2 or 3 of the 1950 Convention.
     5. The Judge thereafter considered the matter on human rights  grounds
        both within and outside the Immigration Rules and  found  that  any
        interference  with  an  established  protected   right   would   be
        proportionate.
     6. The appellant sought permission to appeal which was  granted  on  8
        September 2017 on the basis it was said to  be  arguable  that  the
        Judge had erred in the application of the authority of  FA  (Libya)
        CG [2016] UKUT 43 with particular  reference  to  the  question  of
        whether the appellant is risk of Article 15(c) in Libya.



Error of law


     7. The decision was promulgated on 29 March 2017. The current  country
        guidance case relating to risk on return to Libya, ZMM (Article  15
        (c)) Libya CG [2017] UKUT 263, promulgated on 28  June  2017,  held
        that the violence in Libya has  reached  such  a  high  level  that
        substantial grounds  are  shown  for  believing  that  a  returning
        civilian would, solely on account of his presence on the  territory
        of that country or region face a real risk of being  subject  to  a
        threat to his life or person.
     8. It is accepted that  where  a  new  country  guidance  decision  is
        promulgated  before  a  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  is
        promulgated it is an error  of  law  not  to  follow  that  new  CG
        decision as the First-tier Tribunal  remains  seized  of  the  case
        until promulgation - NA (Libya) v SSHD [2017] EWCA Civ 143  refers.
        In this case, ZMM was promulgated after the date of promulgation of
        the First-tier decision.
     9. In SA (Sri Lanka) v Secretary of  State  for  the  Home  Department
        [2014] EWCA Civ 683 it was held that there was no error of  law  by
        the Upper Tribunal in deciding an asylum claim on the basis of  the
        country guidance then  in  force.  The  correct  remedy  where  the
        country guidance had changed was for an applicant to  make  further
        submissions under paragraph 353 of the Immigration Rules  based  on
        the new guidance.
    10. In accepting that the Judge was unaware of the decision in ZMM, the
        issue that then arises is whether the evidence  considered  by  the
        Judge was similar to that considered by the country guidance panel.
        It was not disputed that in light of the  chronology  the  evidence
        was the similar making the issue whether the findings of the  Judge
        on the basis of that evidence  are  sustainable.  I  find  for  the
        reasons set out in  ZMM  that  they  are  not.   I  find  that  the
        appellant has made out arguable legal  error  in  relation  to  the
        assessment of the humanitarian protection aspects of the appeal.  I
        set the decision aside on this basis.
    11. In light of the current country  guidance  decision  I  remake  the
        decision by allowing the appeal on Article 15(c) grounds only.


Decision

    12. The Immigration Judge materially erred in  law.  I  set  aside  the
        decision of the original Immigration Judge. I remake  the  decision
        as follows. This appeal is allowed on Article 15(c) grounds only.




   Anonymity.


    13. The First-tier Tribunal made an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i)  of
        the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.


        I make such order pursuant to rule 14  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
        (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.




Signed.......................................................
Judge of the Upper Tribunal Hanson

Dated the 8 November 2017
