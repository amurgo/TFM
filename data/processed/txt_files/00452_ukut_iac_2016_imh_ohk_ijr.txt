                             Notice of Decision


            The Queen on the application of Ismail Mohamed Hassan
                           and Omar Hassoon Karada
                                                                  Applicants
                                      v

                 Secretary of State for the Home Department
                                                                  Respondent




Decision of the President, The Honourable Mr  Justice  McCloskey  and  Upper
Tribunal Judge O'Connor: the application for judicial review is refused


On this application for judicial review and following consideration  of  the
documents lodged by the parties and having heard Mr R Drabble QC  and  Ms  A
Radford (of counsel), instructed by Laurence Lupin solicitors on  behalf  of
the Applicants and Mr D Manknell (of counsel), instructed by the  Government
Legal Department on behalf of the Respondent at  hearings  conducted  on  15
June and 18 July 2016


   i) There have been significant developments in Malta during recent years.
       While there may be  imperfections  in  the  Maltese  asylum  decision
      making processes, these are not sufficient to preclude  returns  under
      the Dublin Regulation and, in particular, do not amount to a breach of
      Article 18 of the EU Charter.


  ii) While Article 18 of the EU Charter  confers  rights  of  a  procedural
      nature, the evidence does not establish that these will  be  infringed
      in the event of either of the Applicants pursuing a fresh asylum claim
      in Malta.


 iii) The limitations of the mechanisms  available  under  Maltese  law  for
      challenging refusal of asylum decisions do not infringe Article 18  of
      the EU Charter.


  iv) In judicial review, decisions of  the  Administrative  Court  are  not
      binding on the Upper Tribunal: Secretary of State  for  Justice  v  RB
      [2010] UKUT 454 (AAC) applied.


   v) Per curiam: Article 18 of  the  EU  Charter  provides  an  avenue  for
      challenging transfer decisions under the Dublin Regulation.


  vi) Per curiam: Where a Dublin Regulation transfer decision is  challenged
      under Article 18  of  the  EU  Charter,  the  ECHR  "flagrant  breach"
      standard does not apply. Rather, the test is whether there is  a  real
      risk of a breach of Article 18.


                                  JUDGMENT

     I) INTRODUCTION

   1) Article 18 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European  Union
      (hereinafter  the  "Charter")   occupies   centre   stage   in   these
      proceedings. Under the rubric "Right to asylum", it provides:


           "The right to asylum shall be guaranteed with  due  respect  for
           the rules of the Geneva Convention  of  28  July  1951  and  the
           Protocol of 31 January 1967 relating to the status  of  refugees
           and in accordance with  the  Treaty  establishing  the  European
           Community."

      Article 18 forms the cornerstone of the  Applicants'  challenge.   The
      Respondent, the Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department  (the
      "Secretary of  State"),  has  decided  that  the  Applicants  must  be
      transferred under the provisions  of  the  current  Dublin  Regulation
      (Council Regulation EC No 604/2013) from the  United  Kingdom  to  the
      island of Malta, being the EU state which both first entered following
      a journey from Libya in 2011. The central pillar  of  the  Applicants'
      cases, which have been  advanced  without  distinction,  is  that  the
      implementation of this decision would result in a violation  of  their
      rights under Article 18 of the Charter.


   2) The essence of the riposte on behalf of the Secretary of State is that
      the decision of the Upper Tribunal in R (Hagos) v Secretary  of  State
      for the Home Department [2015] UKUT 0271 (IAC) ("Hagos") and  that  of
      the High Court in R  (Hamad  and  Ararso)  [2015]  EWHC  2511  (Admin)
      ("Hamad & Ararso") are determinative of  the  issues.  It  is  further
      contended that only a breach of either Article 4 or Article 19 of  the
      Charter, neither of  which  is  asserted,  can  prevent  the  proposed
      removal of the Applicants.  The battle lines are thus drawn.


(II) FACTUAL MATRIX


   3) The factual matrix of each challenge  is  essentially  uncontroversial
      and, as appears from the two summaries which  follow,  the  Applicants
      have much in common. Furthermore, while  the  facts  asserted  by  the
      Applicants  are  not  formally  admitted  and  there  are  no   formal
      concessions on behalf of the Secretary of State, the proceedings  have
      been conducted on the basis  that  there  is  no  substantial  factual
      controversy.  While this, of course, is not binding on  the  Tribunal,
      having subjected the Applicants' assertions to  appropriate  scrutiny,
      we find no reason for rejecting or disbelieving any material aspect of
      their accounts.


      Mr Hassan


   4) The first of the two Applicants, Mr Hassan, surrendered to  police  in
      the United Kingdom on 02 August 2014.   He  volunteered  that  he  had
      entered the United Kingdom  illegally.   This  event  constitutes  the
      origins of  these  proceedings.   A  check  of  the  Eurodac  Database
      confirmed that the Applicant's fingerprints matched those  taken  from
      him on 29 April 2011 in Malta, on 26 November 2012 in Switzerland  and
      on 18 January 2013 in Denmark. The Applicant  had  made  a  claim  for
      asylum in all three countries.


   5) Mr Hassan claims to be a national of Sudan, with a date of birth of 20
      June 1982.  He further claims to be a member of the Berti  tribe  from
      Darfur, which is persecuted  by  the  Sudanese  Government  as  it  is
      perceived to be an ethnic African tribe.  This  has  resulted  in  the
      deaths of substantial numbers, including (it is said) this Applicant's
      brother.  This Applicant claims to have  been  unjustifiably  detained
      and then tortured by the  Sudanese  police.   He  asserts  significant
      physical and mental injuries in consequence.


   6) Mr Hassan claims to have escaped to Libya, where  he  remained  for  a
      period of months, at which stage he paid for his transition to  Europe
      by boat, arriving in Malta where, he claims, he was detained  and  his
      fingerprints were forcibly taken from him. With the assistance  of  an
      unknown fellow detainee a form, evidently designed  to  record  asylum
      claims, was completed.  The Applicant claims to have no  understanding
      of what was written and asserts  that  no  legal  advice,  interpreter
      services or other facilities were available.  This was followed by  an
      interview which, in terms, he claims was perfunctory and inadequate as
      he could not answer questions about  the  contents  of  the  completed
      form.  Then there was a second interview, attended by  an  interpreter
      followed by an essentially anodyne consultation  with  a  lawyer.   Mr
      Hassan learned at some unspecified stage that his  asylum  application
      had been refused.


   7) Mr Hassan was confined in close  detention  conditions  in  Malta  for
      approximately  one  year.   He   asserts   significant   inadequacies,
      including substandard facilities, a lack of privacy and a  failure  to
      respect the basics of human dignity in the conditions in which he  was
      detained. Following his  release,  he  was  accommodated  in  shipping
      containers in an open detention centre where he remained for about one
      year.  He at no time received legal, social, medical or other support.
      Thereafter he was  obliged  to  forage  for  himself.  Having  secured
      employment on a construction  site  where  he  saved  some  money  and
      conscious of his vulnerability to arrest on account of  his  irregular
      immigration status, he made  arrangements  to  travel  to  Switzerland
      (supra). From there he travelled to Denmark where from he was forcibly
      returned to Malta.


   8) Upon arriving in Malta for a second  time,  Mr  Hassan  was  arrested,
      detained, convicted in a criminal court and sentenced to  six  months'
      imprisonment.  Having served his sentence, he  found  himself  without
      any assistance or support once again. He managed to re-enter the  open
      detention camp by stealth and, further, to  secure  employment  for  a
      period  of  some  months.   Aware  of  a  general  warning  that   all
      unsuccessful asylum claimants would have to leave  the  camp  by  June
      2014 and fearing for his life if compulsorily repatriated to Sudan, he
      left Malta and travelled to the United Kingdom via Italy  and  France.
      In the pre-action protocol letter, his solicitors formulated his  case
      in the following terms:


           "Our client fears that if he is returned to Sudan his life  will
           be in danger or he will be tortured because of his ethnicity and
           because the Sudanese police believe he is a member or  supporter
           of a group that opposes the Sudanese Government.  Our client  is
           also afraid that if he is returned to Sudan he will be  arrested
           immediately upon arrival because the police  know  his  identity
           and that he has  failed  to  sign  at  the  prison  as  per  the
           conditions upon his release.  Our client also  fears  return  to
           Malta because of the manner in which  the  police  treated  him,
           including but  not  limited  to,  his  arrest  and  six  months'
           imprisonment, because there is a real risk  of  destitution  and
           because there is a real risk that he may be  returned  to  Sudan
           because he has no legal status in Malta following the refusal of
           his asylum application. In addition we submit  that  our  client
           requires medical, psychological and material support because  of
           his past trauma and experiences in Sudan and these will  not  be
           met if he is returned to Malta."

      A real risk of forcible repatriation from Malta to Sudan is also
      asserted.


      Mr Karada


   9) This Applicant also claims to be a national of  Sudan,  where  he  was
      born on 01 January 1984.  He was arrested in the United Kingdom on  04
      January 2014.  A search of the Eurodac Database disclosed that he  had
      previously claimed asylum in Malta on 29 April 2011.


  10) Mr Karada's account is that he is one of five siblings of  a  Sudanese
      family originating in Darfur.  In 1992, when he was aged 8, an  attack
      resulted in the destruction and loss  of  the  family's  dwelling  and
      livestock and obliged them to relocate to a different area  of  Sudan,
      Aljazeera.  There they remained until  June  2008  when,  following  a
      further Janjaweed attack on the  settlement,  his  parents  and  three
      sisters were killed.  His brother fled and there has been  no  contact
      between them since.  Following a period of some six months' detention,
      Mr Karada fled to Libya at the beginning  of  2009.   In  April  2011,
      following the outbreak of the revolution there, he  left  Libya  on  a
      boat, travelling to Malta where he arrived in April 2011.


  11) Mr Karada asserts that he was detained in Malta for  approximately  18
      months in substandard and degrading conditions. Following his release,
      he was unsupported and destitute.  He was one of 20 sharing a room  in
      a camp of sorts.  He claims that while he applied for asylum  he  does
      not know the outcome of his application. He departed Malta in December
      2013 and arrived in the United  Kingdom  on  04  January  2014  having
      travelling through Italy and France.  He asserts  that  his  departure
      from Malta was motivated by the deplorable conditions in which he  had
      been living there. Mr Karada's case is encapsulated in  the  following
      extract from his written statement:


           "I cannot go back to Sudan because of the Al Bashir  regime.   I
           fear that I would be killed. I cannot go back to Malta because I
           had no rights of any kind and lived in total humiliation on  the
           streets. I would prefer to go back to Sudan and be killed rather
           than going through which I endured in Malta."




(12)  As appears from the outline in [7] - [11]  above,  the  focus  of  the
      case made on behalf of Mr Hassan (in his solicitor's  representations)
      and Mr Karada (in his statement) was the destitution  and  degradation
      which they claimed would be their fate  in  the  event  of  having  to
      return to Malta.  This differs from the legal basis upon  which  their
      claims were, ultimately, promoted.  Nothing of substance turns on this
      distinction.




(III) THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S DECISIONS

(13)  In each case the decisions made on behalf of the  Secretary  of  State
      followed upon  the  representations  and  evidence  submitted  by  the
      Applicants' solicitors noted above.  Both  decisions  are  couched  in
      comparable terms.


(14)  In the case of Mr Hassan, the decision letter noted the acceptance  by
      Malta  of  the  United  Kingdoms'  request  that  the  former   accept
      responsibility  for  determining  the  Applicant's  asylum  claim   in
      accordance with the provisions  of  the  Dublin  III  regulation.   Mr
      Hassan's case was certified under Part 2 of Schedule 3 to  the  Asylum
      and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants etc) Act  2004,  the  decision
      maker noting that Malta  is  party  to  the  Refugee  Convention,  the
      European Convention and the  series  of  EU  asylum  Directives.   The
      decision  maker  concluded  that  the  evidence  was  insufficient  to
      displace the principle of mutual confidence or  to  rebut  the  strong
      evidential presumption that Malta would comply with its  international
      obligations or to establish a  real  risk  of  treatment  contrary  to
      Article 3 ECHR. The decision maker further highlighted the absence  of
      any new evidence post-dating the Hagos decision.  The absence  of  any
      medical infirmity or other vulnerability peculiar to the Applicant was
      also emphasised.

(15)  In the case of Mr Karada,  the  terms  of  the  Secretary  of  State's
      decision are materially indistinguishable.  This decision was affirmed
      in what is described as  a  "supplementary  refusal  letter"  compiled
      following the initiation of these proceedings.


(IV)  EXPERT EVIDENCE

(16)  In this context,  we  record  that  Mr  Manknell,  on  behalf  of  the
      Secretary of State, drew to our attention the judicial  criticisms  of
      the expert evidence in R (HK and Others) v Secretary of State for  the
      Home Department [2016] EWHC 857 (Admin),  a  recent  decision  of  the
      Administrative Court concerning the lawfulness of the repatriation  of
      third country asylum  claimants  to  Bulgaria.   The  context  of  the
      present litigation is quite different.  Our first riposte is that  the
      expert evidence in these proceedings has been produced  timeously,  in
      compliance with previous directions  of  the  Tribunal  and  does  not
      violate any equivalent of CPR35 in this jurisdiction.

(17)  Furthermore, expert evidence  is  a  long  established  phenomenon  in
      Tribunal litigation and such evidence, where relevant, is admitted and
      is accorded such weight as specialised  Judges  consider  appropriate.
      In addition, the rigorous standards  and  requirements  applicable  to
      expert evidence in proceedings  in  this  Chamber  do  not  differ  in
      substance from those obtaining in the High Court and, in this context,
      we refer to MOJ and Others (Returns to Mogadishu) (CG) [2014] UKUT 442
      (IAC) which contains a discrete chapter specially  dedicated  to  this
      topic and deals with this Tribunal's Practice Direction:  see  [23]  -
      [28].  The rigorous approach of this Chamber  to  expert  evidence  is
      further illustrated in AAW (Expert Evidence - Weight)  Somalia  [2015]
      UKUT 673 (IAC).


(18)  We note the absence of any challenge to  the  expert  credentials  and
      qualifications of any of the experts concerned.  We are satisfied that
      the expert  evidence  in  question  is  relevant,  has  been  produced
      timeously and in compliance with case management directions, does  not
      violate any procedural rule, is compliant with the Practice  Direction
      and satisfies the test  of  materiality.   Furthermore,  there  is  no
      objection to its admissibility. Given this  series  of  considerations
      recourse to the "indulgence" which the Administrative Court ultimately
      granted  to  the  equivalent  evidence  in   HK   is   not   required.
      Accordingly, the long established approach of examining  relevant  and
      admissible evidence scrupulously and according to it  such  weight  as
      the Tribunal considers appropriate falls to be adopted.


   1) The Applicants have  enlisted  the  support  of  three  experts  whose
      evidence has, in the conventional way, been received in written report
      form.


  12) The first of these experts is Dr Bugre, who  describes  himself  as  a
      "pastor and lawyer" who has worked with asylum claimants for  some  14
      years and  currently  holds  the  appointments  of  Director  for  the
      Foundation for Shelter and Support to Migrants and Executive  Chairman
      of Third Country National Support Network.


      Dr Bugre describes himself as a conduit between migrants and  lawyers,
      for the Jesuit Refugee Service ("JRS"), which counts lawyers among its
      membership.  Very few Maltese lawyers practice in the realm of  asylum
      law.  Typically, a migrant is held in a detention centre for 12  -  18
      months and then released to  an  open  centre,  where  some  financial
      allowance is payable.  Dr Bugre highlights  a  lack  of  co-ordination
      among the various Maltese  agencies  -  the  Immigration  police,  the
      Refugee Commissioner (the "RC") and the  Agency  for  the  Welfare  of
      Asylum Seekers.  This he attributes  to  a  combination  of  the  high
      volumes of asylum claims and inadequate state resources.


  13) Continuing, Dr Bugre suggests that  previously  most  detained  asylum
      applicants received the customary letter documenting the  decision  on
      their claim prior to release.  However, as  pressures  grew,  releases
      were accelerated, with the result that many migrants did  not  receive
      the decision letter and, in consequence,  appeals  were  not  pursued.
      This prosaic difficulty was not remedied by transfers to open  centres
      since residence there was not compulsory.  As  a  result,  Dr  Bugre's
      agency was forced to return large numbers of decision letters  to  the
      RC. Furthermore, as a result of inadequate co-ordination,  a  lack  of
      information and the unavailability of legal advice, coupled  with  the
      time limit of two months, appeals were rarely pursued in practice.  Dr
      Bugre also observes that decision letters were  routinely  written  in
      English and were  inadequately  detailed.   The  first  of  these  two
      phenomena has been addressed "recently".  He suggests that  inadequate
      asylum interviews were commonplace.   Certain  migrants,  particularly
      those from Darfur (Sudan),  distrusted  the  JRS  on  account  of  the
      Eritrean nationality of some of its employees.


  14) Dr Bugre also  highlights  the  phenomenon  of  many  migrants  taking
      medication  to  treat  and  remedy  psychological   conditions.    The
      departure of many asylum claimants from Malta was precipitated by  the
      inadequacies of  the  reception  conditions  and  related  facilities.
      Sudanese  migrants  perceived  themselves  to  be   the   victims   of
      discrimination, treated less favourably than  those  originating  from
      Somalia, Ethiopia or  Eritrea.  There  were  few  successful  Sudanese
      asylum claims, generally confined to the well-educated.


  15) Dr Bugre recounts the introduction of changes in  2015  stimulated  by
      the recast Procedures Directive and the  associated  disappearance  of
      mandatory  detention.   While  critical  of  the  medical   facilities
      provided,  Dr  Bugre  gives  no  description  of  any  other  changes,
      improvements or developments of any  kind.  We  construe  his  witness
      statement  as  relating  mainly  to  the  pre-2015  period   and,   in
      particular, the "peak" phase between 2005 and 2013.  One  learns  from
      this statement very little indeed about the reception  conditions  and
      related facilities and arrangements prevailing  during  the  past  two
      years.


  16) Dr Zannit and Dr Bonnici, both Doctors of Law attached to the  Faculty
      of Laws of the University of Malta, are the joint authors of a  report
      prepared specifically for the purpose of these proceedings,  dated  18
      April 2016. The expertise which they profess embraces  the  fields  of
      asylum, immigration and human rights generally.  As in the case of  Dr
      Bugre, there is  no  challenge  to  their  expert  qualifications  and
      credentials, which we accept.


  17) The detailed report of Dr Zannit and Dr Bonnici contains much  factual
      material, together with a series  of  assessments  and  opinions.   We
      would summarise the salient elements  of  their  opinion  evidence  as
      follows:


   i) The  Applicants'  claims  about  their  previous  treatment  in  Malta
      harmonise with both the authors' researches and the  statement  of  Dr
      Bugre.


  ii) The non-service of hundreds of decisions of the Refugee Appeals  Board
      ("RAB"), some of several years  vintage,  is  an  uncontentious  fact,
      openly accepted by the RAB itself.


 iii) While the regulations governing proceedings before the  RAB  admit  of
      the possibility of an oral hearing, this lies within the discretion of
      the appointed chairman and occurs rarely in practice.


  iv) Since the Applicants were legitimately released from detention  before
      departing Malta, this ".... would not lead to  [them]  being  detained
      upon return".


   v) If either of the  Applicants  departed  from  Malta  in  an  irregular
      manner, that is to say without the requisite travel documents or using
      a false document or using a document issued to  another  person,  they
      are liable to be charged with  a  criminal  offence,  giving  rise  to
      remand custody in the Corradino Correctional Facility ("CCF")  for  up
      to 2 months and a conviction will foreseeably ensue. The free services
      of a lawyer would be available during any such process.


  vi) In the event of either Applicant being  convicted,  there  can  be  no
      confident prediction of  the  likely  ensuing  penalty.   The  options
      include a maximum fine of some E11,000,  imprisonment  for  a  maximum
      term of 2 years, a combination  of  a  fine  and  imprisonment  and  a
      suspended sentence.


 vii) The practice of automatic detention of  irregular  entrants  has  been
      discontinued.  Now new entrants are accommodated,  medically  screened
      and processed in a designated centre during a period of up to 7  days,
      during  which  they  are  informed  of  their  right  to   apply   for
      international protection and undergo a so-called "vulnerability"  test
      to enable the provision of proper support and, where appropriate,  age
      verification tests.  These new  processes  are  based  on  the  recast
      Returns Directive.


viii) The detention of irregular  entrants  can  be  effected  only  if  the
      conditions of the Directive are satisfied.


  ix) A fresh application  for  asylum  in  Malta  by  either  Applicant  is
      unlikely to overcome the admissibility threshold, given the  following
      factors:


                 "...  The admissibility criteria are hard to  know  and  to
                 fulfil ... legal aid is likely to be unavailable ....   The
                 procedures of the [RC] and [RAB] are largely  conducted  in
                 secret, revolving around documents which are not translated
                 and difficult to  access  and  understand  and  there  are,
                 consequently,  substantial  information  gaps  between  the
                 asylum seeker and the applicable law."


   x) A decision of the Refugee Commissioner of Malta  ("RC")  dismissing  a
      new asylum claim as inadmissible, gives rise to  automatic  review  by
      the RAB within 3 working  days.   Experience  demonstrates  that  this
      process is invariably unproductive.


  xi) While, in principle, returned unsuccessful asylum  claimants  such  as
      the Applicants could seek to challenge the further decisions of the RC
      and RAB by judicial review, this remedy is purely illusory.


 xii) It will be possible for either Applicant to make  a  fresh  claim  for
      asylum in Malta.  However, the statutory  test  of  "new  elements  or
      findings" (infra), coupled  with  an  admissibility  threshold,  would
      complicate the prospects of such a claim, which would be determined by
      the RC, succeeding.

xiii) State funded legal advice is  not  available  at  the  first  instance
      either in respect of a first asylum claim or a subsequent such  claim.
      While such assistance is available at the  appeal  stage,  it  suffers
      from inadequacies.


  18) The joint report of Dr Zannit and Dr Bonnici is a commendable piece of
      work.  It is evidently well researched and comprehensive in its terms.
       Its structure is  clear  and  comprehensible  and  the  authors  have
      addressed,  in  coherent  terms,  each  of  the  questions  they  were
      requested to consider. Furthermore, the report is balanced.  We detect
      no hint of partisanship or exaggeration. Certain parts of  the  report
      will require our detailed and critical scrutiny, an exercise to  which
      we shall return at a later stage of this judgment.




(V)   RELEVANT MALTESE LEGISLATION

  19) Within the materials which we have considered are certain measures  of
      Maltese legislation, including in particular the Refugees Act 2001  as
      amended, the most recent  amendment  having  been  effected  in  2015.
      Pursuant to the provisions of Part II and Part III, the first instance
      decision maker is the RC and  an  appeal  lies  to  the  RAB,  a  body
      consisting of three members, one of whom must be a practising advocate
      with seven years' experience.  By article 7 the decisions  of  the  RC
      which may be challenged on appeal, include  refusals  of  applications
      for protection and refusals on  the  ground  of  inadmissibility.  Per
      article 7(2), an appeal to the RAB must be made within  15  days  from
      the notification of the RC's decision.  The RAB is obliged, by article
      7(4), to provide an interpreter  where  required.  Per  article  7(5),
      there is a statutory right to free legal aid. By article 7(8) the  RAB
      regulates its own procedure. Article 7A of the statute makes provision
      for a second, or subsequent, application  by  an  unsuccessful  asylum
      claimant. This provision is of particular importance in the context of
      the case made by both Applicants.


  20) We have also considered a related measure of subordinate  legislation,
      namely  the  Procedural  Standards  for   Granting   and   Withdrawing
      International  Protection  Regulations.    In  accordance  with   this
      instrument, decisions of the RC  should  normally  be  made  within  a
      maximum period  of  six  months  (Regulation  6);  special  procedural
      guarantees should be provided in  appropriate  cases  (Regulation  7);
      delay in pursuing an application  for  protection  is  not  conclusion
      (Regulation 8); all applications for protection must be  subjected  to
      appropriate examination (Regulation  8);  the  RC  regulates  his  own
      procedure and  must  endeavour  to  gather  all  relevant  information
      (Regulation 9); a personal interview of  the  claimant  is  obligatory
      (Regulation 10); all such interviews must be recorded (Regulation 11);
      free legal assistance shall  be  granted  under  the  same  conditions
      applicable to Maltese nationals and  represented  applicants  must  be
      permitted to consult  their  lawyer  at  all  stages  of  the  process
      (Regulation 12).


  21) Having regard to the main thrust  of  the  Applicants'  challenge,  we
      consider that the most important  aspects  of  the  Maltese  statutory
      measures are those relating to new/subsequent claims for asylum (which
      we shall  describe  as  "a  later  application").   Viewed  from  this
      discrete perspective our analysis of the relevant legislation  may  be
      summarised thus:


   i)  It  is  possible  for  an  unsuccessful  claimant  for  international
      protection to make a later application for such protection.


  ii) A later application shall be  considered  only  if  it  contains  "new
      elements or findings" of which the claimant could not have been  aware
      or which he could not have submitted in the  context  of  the  initial
      application.


 iii) The time limit for making a later application  is  15  days,  measured
      from the date upon which the claimant obtained the new information.


  iv) The examination of a later  application  may  -  but  not  must  -  be
      conducted via the mechanism of written submissions.


   v) Upon receipt of a later application, the first question for the RC  is
      whether  it  is  admissible.   A  later  application  will  be  deemed
      inadmissible where it contains  no  "new  elements  or  findings".   A
      decision on admissibility is made via the mechanism of a  "preliminary
      examination".


  vi) At this preliminary, admissibility stage, the test to  be  applied  is
      whether "new elements or findings have arisen or have  been  presented
      by the applicant which significantly add  to  the  likelihood  of  the
      applicant qualifying as a beneficiary  of  international  protection".
      Furthermore, at this stage, the RC must be satisfied that the claimant
      was "through no fault of his own  incapable  of  concluding  that  new
      elements or findings have arisen".


 vii) If the threshold outlined immediately above is overcome, the claim  is
      subjected to "further examination". Where the assessment is  that  the
      requisite threshold is not overcome, the fresh, or further, claim   is
      not processed according to the  standard  appeal  procedure.   Rather,
      such claims are assigned  to  the  so-called  "accelerated  "procedure
      (per Articles 23 and 24).


viii) The main consequences of assignment to the accelerated  procedure  are
      that a period of three working days for examination of  the  claim  is
      triggered and there is  no  express  right  to  an  interview.  If  an
      interview is achievable, an  interpreter  must  be  provided  and  the
      claimant must be informed of his right to  the  services  of  a  legal
      adviser.


  ix) Where the outcome of this accelerated  examination  is  an  assessment
      that the fresh, or further, claim is inadmissible, the  RC  formulates
      this as a recommendation to the Chairman of the RAB who is  the  final
      decision maker and whose decision, in theory, may not be challenged in
      any Court.



       The most important consideration is that the full suite of procedural
      safeguards does not apply to claims assigned to the accelerated
      determination procedure.




  22) Insofar as the Applicants' expert evidence does not  concur  with  the
      foregoing analysis we do not accept it.  We  differentiate  this  from
      the experts' evidence relating to certain aspects of how  the  Maltese
      legislation is applied in practice.  A paradigm example of this is the
      operation of the 15 day time limit noted in [29](iii) above. Based  on
      information provided by the RC himself, the experts' evidence on  this
      discrete issue is that this time limit is rarely applied  in  practice
      and, where it is applied, it operates as a further,  rather  than  the
      sole,  ground  for  deeming  a   subsequent   application   manifestly
      inadmissible. We accept this evidence.


  23) There is no challenge to the experts' evidence, which we accept,  that
      under Maltese law a right to free legal assistance does not  exist  at
      the stage of first instance decision making. This right is confined to
      the appeal stage.  We accept this evidence.  We further accept that in
      the first instance context the prospects of an asylum  claimant  being
      able to engage a private lawyer are minimal, with the result that,  in
      reality, legal advice and representation can only be  secured  through
      one of the two NGOs providing this service, namely the Jesuit  Refugee
      Service of Malta ("JRS") and the so-called Adidtus Foundation, each of
      which is constrained by its  finite  resources.  We  also  accept  the
      experts' evidence that in cases where asylum  claimants  are  detained
      access to one of these organisations is more difficult.




(VI)  THE OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE


  24) In R (Hagos) - v - Secretary of State for the Home Department  (Dublin
      Returns - Malta) IJR  [2015]  UKUT  0271(IAC)  (hereinafter  "Hagos"),
      decided just over one year ago, this Tribunal considered a substantial
      body of evidence being  on  the  conditions  prevailing  in  Malta  in
      relation to the processing and determination of protection claims  and
      the reception and treatment of migrants: see [8] - [28].  The  parties
      are agreed that, in the context of these  proceedings,  the  objective
      evidence framework is  unchanged.   The  evidence  assembled  for  the
      purpose of these proceedings includes all of the reports considered in
      Hagos. In  addition,  we  have  considered  a  helpful  summary  paper
      prepared by Mr Drabble QC and Ms Radford on behalf of the  Applicants.
      This is attached at Appendix 1.



(VII) LEGAL FRAMEWORK

  25) This has been outlined in both Hagos and other reported decisions and,
      thus, does not require to be reproduced in extenso.  In [1] above,  we
      have set forth Article 18  of  the  Charter.   Having  regard  to  the
      obligation imposed by Article 52(7)  of  the  Charter,  we  must  also
      consider the corresponding "Explanation" which is in these terms:


           "Explanation on Article 18 - Right to asylum


           The text of the Article has been based on TEC  Article  63,  now
           replaced by Article 78 of the Treaty on the Functioning  of  the
           European Union, which requires the Union to respect  the  Geneva
           Convention  on  refugees.  Reference  should  be  made  to   the
           Protocols relating to the United Kingdom and Ireland, annexed to
           the Treaties, and to Denmark, to determine the extent  to  which
           those Member States implement Union law in  this  area  and  the
           extent to which this Article is applicable to them. This Article
           is in line with the Protocol on Asylum annexed to the Treaties."



      While the formulation of the Applicants' case  in  writing  also  made
      reference to Article 1  (human  dignity)  and  Article  47  (effective
      remedy) of  the  Charter  neither  of  these  provisions,  ultimately,
      featured in their case as presented.



  26) While the provisions of the "Dublin III" instrument  of  EU  law  also
      form part of the legal framework, it is unnecessary to reproduce these
      in extenso.  In short, the asylum  applications  of  both  Applicants,
      made in the United Kingdom, were  considered  under  the  auspices  of
      Dublin III, resulting in the transmission of "take charge" requests by
      the United Kingdom to Malta to accept responsibility for "examination"
      (viz detailed consideration and determination) of the applications and
      the acceptance by Malta of such requests.  Given  the  thrust  of  the
      Applicants' legal challenge, reference must be made to  Article  3(2),
      which provides:


           "Where no Member State responsible  can  be  designated  on  the
           basis of the criteria  listed  in  this  Regulation,  the  first
           Member  State  in  which  the  application   for   international
           protection was lodged shall be responsible for examining it.


           Where it is impossible to transfer an applicant  to  the  Member
           State primarily designated  as  responsible  because  there  are
           substantial grounds for believing that there are systemic  flaws
           in the asylum procedure and  in  the  reception  conditions  for
           applicants in that Member State, resulting in a risk of  inhuman
           or degrading treatment within the meaning of Article  4  of  the
           Charter  of  Fundamental  Rights  of  the  European  Union,  the
           determining Member State shall continue to examine the  criteria
           set out in Chapter III in order  to  establish  whether  another
           Member State can be designated as responsible.


           Where the transfer cannot be made pursuant to this paragraph  to
           any Member State designated on the basis of the criteria set out
           in Chapter III or to the  first  Member  State  with  which  the
           application was  lodged,  the  determining  Member  State  shall
           become the Member State responsible."

      While  Article  17(1)  invests  the  United  Kingdom  with  a  general
      discretion to  examine  an  asylum  claim  notwithstanding  that  such
      responsibility would ordinarily fall on another Member State,  nothing
      turns on this in the present proceedings.  Article 27  of  Dublin  III
      must  also  be  considered,  given  the  nature  of  the   Applicants'
      challenge:


           "1.   The applicant or another person as referred to in  Article
                 18(1)(c) or (d)  shall  have  the  right  to  an  effective
                 remedy, in the form of an appeal or a review, in  fact  and
                 in law, against a transfer  decision,  before  a  Court  or
                 Tribunal."


      This is the right which both Applicants are in  effect  exercising  in
      these judicial review proceedings.


  27) The certification provisions of the Asylum and Immigration  (Treatment
      of Claimants etc) Act 2004 (the "2004 Act") form  another  element  of
      the legal framework.  In light of its bulk, Part 2 of  Schedule  3  to
      the 2004 Act is attached at Appendix 2.


  28) There is a  series  of  EU  Directives  which  prescribe  the  minimum
      standards for the reception of asylum applicants  and  the  processing
      and determination of their claims.  These are:


   i)  Council  Directive  2003/9/EC  (the  "Reception   Directive"):   this
      prescribes minimum standards for the reception and treatment of asylum
      Applicants.


  ii) Council Directive 2004/83/EC  (the  "Qualification  Directive"):  this
      prescribes minimum standards for the qualification and status of third
      party nationals  or  stateless  persons  as  refugees  or  as  persons
      otherwise in need  of  international  protection,  together  with  the
      contents of the protection to be conferred.


 iii)  Council  Directive  2005/85/EC  (the  "Procedures  Directive"):  this
      prescribes minimum standards  in  respect  of  the  procedures  to  be
      applied by Member States  in  the  grant  and  withdrawal  of  refugee
      status.

      These measures all form part of  the  Common  European  Asylum  System
      ("CEAS"). By their terms, each  explicitly  respects  the  fundamental
      rights and observes the principles enshrined in the Charter.


  29) The three Directives noted above give effect to Article 78 TFEU, which
      declares that the Union shall develop a common policy on  asylum.   It
      states:


           "1.  The  Union  shall  develop  a  common  policy  on   asylum,
           subsidiary protection and temporary protection with  a  view  to
           offering  appropriate  status  to  any  third-country   national
           requiring international protection and ensuring compliance  with
           the  principle  of  non-refoulement.  This  policy  must  be  in
           accordance with the Geneva Convention of 28 July  1951  and  the
           Protocol of 31 January 1967 relating to the status of  refugees,
           and other relevant treaties.


           2. For the purpose of paragraph 1, the European  Parliament  and
           the Council, acting in accordance with the ordinary  legislative
           procedure, shall adopt measures for  a  common  European  asylum
           system comprising:


             (a)  a  uniform  status  of  asylum  for  nationals  of  third
             countries, valid throughout the Union;


             (b) a uniform status of subsidiary protection for nationals of
             third countries who, without obtaining European asylum, are in
             need of international protection;


             (c) a common system  of  temporary  protection  for  displaced
             persons in the event of a massive inflow;


             (d) common procedures for  the  granting  and  withdrawing  of
             uniform asylum or subsidiary protection status;


             (e) criteria and mechanisms for determining which Member State
             is responsible for considering an application  for  asylum  or
             subsidiary protection;


             (f) standards concerning the conditions for the  reception  of
             applicants for asylum or subsidiary protection;


             (g) partnership and cooperation with third countries  for  the
             purpose of managing inflows of people applying for  asylum  or
             subsidiary or temporary protection."


(VIII)      THE PARTIES' RESPECTIVE CASES

  30) As noted in [1] above, the centrepiece of the Applicants' case is that
      they cannot be lawfully transferred to Malta  as  this  would  violate
      their rights under Article 18 of the Charter.   Mr  Drabble  submitted
      that the criteria applicable  to  Article  18  are  contained  in  the
      Refugee Convention and its Protocols, Article 63 TEU  and  Article  78
      TFEU.  He argued that these constituent elements combine to confer  on
      the Applicants a right to have their asylum applications determined by
      a fair procedure and within a  reasonable  time.  He  contended  that,
      historically, this right had been denied to  both  Applicants,  giving
      rise to breaches of Articles 1, 18 and 47 of the Charter. There  is  a
      real risk of further infringements of the same Charter  provisions  in
      the cases of both  Applicants.   It  follows  that  the  Secretary  of
      State's decisions certifying their claims as unfounded  and  requiring
      them to return to Malta are unlawful.


  31) The interlocking elements of the Applicants' case are conveniently set
      forth in the skeleton argument of Mr Drabble QC and Ms Radford in  the
      following terms:


       a) Article 18 of the Charter confers on individuals  the  substantive
          right to be granted asylum, within a reasonable time,  where  they
          satisfy the relevant criteria, in which  event  the  Member  State
          concerned has no discretion.


       b) The asylum criteria applicable to Article 18 are  those  found  in
          the Refugee Convention and its protocols.


       c) In addition  to  (a),  Article  18  confers  a  right  to  a  fair
          procedure.


       d) Historically, this latter right was denied to both  Applicants  by
          reason  of  the  shortcomings  in  the  reception  conditions  and
          arrangements for the processing and determination of asylum claims
          prevailing in Malta in 2011/2012.


       e)  The  Applicants,  having  the  status  of   unsuccessful   asylum
          claimants, are at real risk of being unable to access  afresh  the
          Maltese asylum procedure in the future, with a resulting breach of
          their rights under Articles 1, 18 and 47 of the Charter.


       f) The redress procedures in Malta being either illusory or too  slow
          to remedy the aforementioned breaches, the Applicants are at  real
          risk of suffering an extended state of limbo  and  are  liable  to
          suffer destitution and undergo refoulement,  in  contravention  of
          Articles 1, 18 and 47 of the Charter.


      It is submitted that, by reason of the above, the certification of the
      Applicants' asylum claims by the Secretary of State and  the  decision
      to transfer them to Malta infringes their rights under Article 18  and
      of the Charter.

  32) The submissions of Mr Drabble focus on both the past and  future.   As
      regards the past, it is contended that both Applicants'  rights  under
      Articles 1, 18 and 47  of  the  Charter  were  infringed  due  to,  in
      summary, a lack of adequate information; an unfair interview  process;
      a failure to provide the decision made (in the case of Mr  Karada);  a
      failure to provide a reasoned decision (in the case of Mr Hassan); the
      absence of legal advice and assistance; and (in Mr Karada's  case)  an
      inability to participate effectively in the hearing which he attended.
      It is submitted  that  these  shortcomings  chime  with  the  systemic
      deficiencies  in  the  Maltese  asylum  procedures  and   arrangements
      prevailing at the material time, namely 2011/2013.


  33) In response to  our  questions,  Mr  Drabble  provided  the  following
      clarification. In order to succeed, it is  not  necessary  for  either
      Applicant to demonstrate historical breaches of their Charter  rights.
      The submission advanced is that if the Tribunal  concludes  that  such
      breaches did occur, this will serve to fortify  the  mainstay  of  the
      Applicants' cases, which is that they are at real risk of  breaches of
      their Charter rights in the  future  in  the  event  of  the  transfer
      decisions being implemented.


  34) In crystallising his argument Mr Drabble suggested that the  two  main
      issues of law dividing the parties are, respectively:


       a) the nature and importance of the rights conferred by  Article  18;
          and


       b) the core of the Article 18 right, namely the conferment of refugee
          status on the person concerned.


      The main future risk pertaining to the Applicants,  he  argued,  is  a
      risk of finding themselves in "protracted limbo" (his phrase) based on
      the scenario of returning to Malta and presenting fresh asylum claims.
      A second, further risk, namely that of refoulement is also asserted.


  35)  Mr Drabble concurred with our  characterisation  of  the  Article  18
      right as a right to  be  granted  refugee  status  provided  that  the
      internationally  recognised  qualifying  conditions   are   satisfied,
      supported by a  series  of  procedural,  or  adjectival,  rights.   He
      further agreed that in the event of the  Applicants  pursuing  renewed
      asylum claims in Malta culminating in  lawful  refusal  decisions,  no
      question of unlawful refoulement would arise.


  36) Mr Drabble contended that the Dublin  Regulation  machinery  will  not
      provide vindication of the rights formulated above for  the  Applicant
      since, in the scenario of enforced return to Malta, any further asylum
      claims by them will not be determined within a reasonable time.  This,
      he argued, will per se infringe their rights  under  Article  18.   Mr
      Drabble further submitted that one of  the  rights  protected  by  the
      Dublin Regulation regime is a right to have one's  asylum  application
      determined expeditiously. He contended that  there  is  a  substantial
      risk of the Dublin Regulation machinery  seriously  malfunctioning  in
      this respect, with  the  result  that  the  enforced  removal  of  the
      Applicants to Malta would be unlawful.


  37) Turning to the factual matrix of the Applicants' cases,  Mr  Drabble's
      main submission was that they find themselves in  a  situation  which,
      predictively, is less advantageous and more exposed than that  of  the
      claimant  in  Hagos.   The  interlocking  elements  of  this  discrete
      submission are the inadequate  processing and determination  of  their
      original asylum claims in Malta; the absence of the  services  of  any
      NGO; the fact that the original asylum claim papers cannot be provided
      to their English lawyers for consideration and  advice;  the  complete
      absence of any relevant documents; and the likelihood that  any  fresh
      asylum  application  by   either   Applicant   will   result   in   an
      inadmissibility  decision  which,  he   suggested,    is   effectively
      unappealable  under Maltese law.


  38) On behalf of the Secretary of State,  Mr  Manknell  submits,  firstly,
      that the decisions in Hagos and Hamad & Ararso  are  determinative  of
      the Applicants' challenges.  It is contended that the cases  of  these
      two Applicants are, in all material respects,  indistinguishable  from
      those of Messrs Hagos, Hamad and Ararso.  The absence of  any  novelty
      in the objective exercise is emphasised.  Mr Manknell further  submits
      that, considered in its totality, the evidence  falls  well  short  of
      establishing  that  Malta  will  not  comply  with  its  international
      obligations. Systemic deficiencies  in  the  relevant  procedures  and
      arrangements are not demonstrated.  Mr Manknell further  submits  that
      the Applicants' reliance on Articles 1, 18 and 47 of  the  Charter  is
      misconceived since the  only  means  of  successfully  opposing  their
      proposed transfer to Malta is to establish a real risk of a breach  of
      either Article 4 or Article 19.


  39) Developing his argument, Mr Manknell advanced two main theses.  First,
      by reason of the existing case law Article 18 of the Charter cannot be
      invoked as a stand alone basis for resisting  enforced  removal  under
      the Dublin Regulation. Only a real risk of a breach of either  Article
      4 or Article 19 of the Charter  will  suffice.  Second,  there  is  no
      material factual difference between the present  cases  and  those  of
      Hagos  and  Hamad  and  Ararso.   Mr  Manknell   submitted,   in   the
      alternative, that if the Applicants can permissibly invoke Article  18
      of the Charter, the operative threshold is that of flagrant breach and
      their cases fall short of establishing this.  It was further submitted
      that  the  CJEU  test  of  systemic  deficiencies  is  not  satisfied.
      Furthermore, insofar as any risk of refoulement is  demonstrated,  the
      appropriate course will be for the  Applicants,  on  the  scenario  of
      enforced return, to seek their remedy against the state  of  Malta  by
      applying to the ECtHR for  interim  relief.   Mr  Manknell  also  laid
      emphasis on the ethos of the Common European  Asylum  System  ("CEAS")
      which, he contended, contra-indicates one Member State  reviewing  the
      asylum handling and decision making processes of another.


  40) Mr Manknell further drew attention to the  sparsity  of  the  evidence
      relating to the Applicants' claims for asylum in Malta  in  2011/2012,
      contending that in any event this evidence  is  irrelevant  since  the
      focus must be on predicted future  events.  He  developed  the  linked
      submission that the policy of Malta's fresh claim procedure (which  we
      have summarised in [30] above) is irrelevant.  The substance  of  this
      argument is that the Applicants do not make the  case  that  they  are
      likely to bring fresh asylum claims. Rather, the  substance  of  their
      complaint relates to historical shortcomings  in  the  processing  and
      determination of their asylum claims in Malta in 2011/2012.  The final
      element of Mr Manknell's submission entails the  contention  that,  in
      any event, the evidence fails to demonstrate systemic deficiencies  in
      the processing and determination of fresh asylum claims in Malta.  The
      last port of call in this discrete  submission  is  that  the  interim
      relief process of the ECtHR would, in any event, be available  to  the
      Applicants.


(IX) CONSIDERATION

      The CJEU Decision in NS & ME


  41) The submissions of the parties focused on a small  number  of  decided
      cases.  In two of the leading cases, NS and ME [2011]  EUECJ  C-411/10
      and EM (Eritrea) v Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2014]
      UKSC 12, the Charter right which  features  with  most  prominence  is
      Article 4.  In NS and ME the CJEU ruled, at [94]:


           "....  The Member States, including the national courts, may not
           transfer an asylum seeker  to  the  'Member  State  responsible'
           within the meaning of  Regulation  number  343/2003  where  they
           cannot be unaware  that  systemic  deficiencies  in  the  asylum
           procedure and in the reception conditions of asylum  seekers  in
           that Member State amount to substantial  grounds  for  believing
           that the asylum seeker would face a real risk of being subjected
           to inhuman or degrading treatment within the meaning of  Article
           4 of the Charter."




      In Hagos, this Tribunal noted, in [43], the series of hurdles which  a
      claimant must overcome in order to satisfy this test.




      EM (Eritrea)


  42) In EM (Eritrea), the Supreme Court construed the decision  in  NS  and
      ME, ruling that it was harmonious with the  following  conclusion,  at
      [58]:


           "The  Court  of   Appeal's   conclusion   that   only   systemic
           deficiencies in the  listed  countries'  asylum  procedures  and
           reception conditions  will  constitute  a  basis  for  resisting
           transfer to the listed country cannot be upheld.   The  critical
           test remains that articulated in Soering v United Kingdom [1989]
           11 EHRR 439. The removal of a person from a Member State of  the
           Council of Europe to another country is forbidden if it is shown
           that there is a real  risk  that  the  person  transferred  will
           suffer treatment contrary to Article 3 of ECHR."

      Given  that  Article  3  ECHR  and  Article  4  of  the  Charter   are
      indistinguishable,  we  observe  that  this  passage  applies  mutatis
      mutandis to a context such as the present where both the  transferring
      state and the proposed host state are EU Member States.   The  Supreme
      Court, in thus concluding, reasoned that the demonstration of systemic
      deficiencies does not constitute a sine qua non.  Rather


           "...  the search for such failings is  by  way  of  a  route  to
           establish that there is a real risk of Article 3 breach,  rather
           than a hurdle to be surmounted."


       See [63].

  43) As this Tribunal noted in Hagos, at [45], there is evident  disharmony
      between the decision of the Supreme Court in EM (Eritrea) and that  of
      the Grand Chamber of the CJEU  in  Abdullahi  v  Bundesasylamt  [2013]
      EUECJ C-394/12, which was promulgated days before the Supreme  Court's
      decision.  Neither of the two Courts considered the  decision  of  the
      other. The evident disharmony arises on account of the formulation  of
      the test in [60] of the decision of the Grand  Chamber,  where  it  is
      stated that in circumstances where the host  Member  State  agrees  to
      "take charge" of the asylum applicant for the purpose of examining his
      claim, the  demonstration  of  systemic  deficiencies  (in  the  sense
      outlined above) is the  "only"  way  in  which  the  transfer  can  be
      successfully challenged.



      The Abdullahi Decision

  44) Having regard to the main orientation of  the  Applicants'  challenge,
      the task - and duty - of examining  in  some  depth  the  decision  in
      Abdullahi seems to us inescapable.  We begin with an interesting point
      of distinction between this case and that of NS and ME.  In the latter
      case, the Charter rights invoked by the claimants, who  were  opposing
      their proposed  enforced  return  to  Greece  under  the  2003  Dublin
      Regulation, were Articles 1, 4, 18 and 47.  The Grand  Chamber  Stated
      in [86]:


           "if there are substantial grounds for believing that  there  are
           systemic flaws in the asylum procedure and reception  conditions
           for asylum applicants in the Member State responsible, resulting
           in inhuman or degrading treatment, within the meaning of Article
           4 of the Charter, of asylum seekers transferred to the territory
           of that Member State, the transfer would  be  incompatible  with
           that provision."

      As appears from [94],  [106]  and  [123],  this  is  what  NS  and  ME
decided.


  45) In Abdullahi, it is of note that the Grand  Chamber  chose  to  answer
      only the first of the three questions referred to it by  the  Austrian
      Court.  The essence of  this  question  was  whether,  having  made  a
      decision to transfer the claimant to the Member State considered to be
      responsible for examining the asylum application, the national  review
      authority  could  change  its  mind  and  make  a  fresh  decision  in
      circumstances where it emerged that a different Member State  was  the
      responsible one.  The Grand Chamber supplied the following answer,  in
      [62]:


           "Having regard to the foregoing considerations,  the  answer  to
           Question 1 is that Article 19(2) of Regulation No 343/2003 must
           be interpreted as meaning that, in circumstances where a  Member
           State has agreed to take charge of an applicant  for  asylum  on
           the basis of the criterion laid down in Article  10(1)  of  that
           regulation - namely, as the Member State of the first  entry  of
           the applicant for asylum into the European Union - the only  way
           in which the applicant for asylum can  call  into  question  the
           choice of that criterion is by pleading systemic deficiencies in
           the asylum procedure and in the conditions for the reception  of
           applicants for  asylum  in  that  Member  State,  which  provide
           substantial grounds for believing that the applicant for  asylum
           would face  a  real  risk  of  being  subjected  to  inhuman  or
           degrading treatment within the  meaning  of  Article  4  of  the
           Charter."


  46) The effect of this decision was that while the Member State  of  first
      entry was Greece, Hungary was bound by its acceptance of  the  request
      of the Austrian authorities to take charge of the  claimant.  Notably,
      the claimant was not contending that she would suffer any infringement
      of her rights under Article 4 of the Charter in  the  event  of  being
      transferred to Hungary.  Rather, the two elements  of  her  case  were
      that she would suffer a breach of Article 4  in  the  event  of  being
      transferred to Greece and that, in the circumstances, the  responsible
      Member State was Austria.  That the claimant was making  no  complaint
      about conditions in Hungary was explicitly recognised by the Court  in
      [61].  It follows, in our judgment, that while the Grand Chamber  took
      the opportunity  to  restate  the  NS  and  ME  test  in  indisputably
      different and more emphatic terms, by the repeated use  of  the  "only
      way" standard in [60], [62] and [64], certain questions did  not  fall
      to be determined and were not addressed in consequence.  These include
      the following:


       a) First, the question of whether a Dublin  Regulation  transfer  to
          another Member State for the purpose of examining the  claimant's
          protection application could be successfully opposed  invoking  a
          provision of the Charter other than Article 4.

       b)  Second, if the above question attracts an affirmative answer, is
          the test to be  applied:  "systemic  deficiencies"  or  something
          else?

       c) Third, interaction between the Charter  and  the  ECHR  dichotomy
          relating to apprehended breaches of Articles 2 and 3 (on the  one
          hand) and apprehended breaches of other Convention rights (on the
          other).



  47) We venture to add  the  observation  that  there  is  something  of  a
      disconnect between the questions referred to the  CJEU  and  the  main
      conclusion contained in its judgment.  In countries  adhering  to  the
      common law tradition there would be a lively debate about whether  the
      conclusion of the Grand Chamber constitutes an  essential  element  of
      its reasoning.  If yes, it belongs to the ratio decidendi.  If not, it
      is otherwise.

  48) Based on our analysis above we would  venture  to  suggest,  with  due
      deference, that the decision of the Grand Chamber in Abdullahi is  not
      without its difficulties.




      The Decision in Puid


  49) Next, in Federal Republic of Germany v Puid (Case  C-4/11)  [2014]  QB
      346, a national of Iran travelled to Greece and on to  Germany,  where
      his application for asylum was refused and,  in  accordance  with  the
      criteria specified in Dublin II, Greece was identified as  the  Member
      State responsible for examining his  asylum  claim  and  his  transfer
      there was ordered.  This was annulled by a German Court on  the  basis
      that Germany was required to exercise the assumption of responsibility
      enshrined  in  Article  3(2)  in  light  of  the  relevant  conditions
      prevailing in Greece.  On appeal, a reference was made to the CJEU.


  50) The ruling of the Grand Chamber adopted, without qualification, the NS
      and ME test: see [29] - [31]. The second aspect of the  ruling,  which
      does not arise in the present case, was that where the  said  test  is
      satisfied, it does not  follow  automatically  that  the  transferring
      state must  examine  the  application  under  Article  3(2).   Rather,
      applying  the  criteria  enshrined  in  Chapter  III  of  the   Dublin
      Regulation, a transfer to another Member State is  possible,  provided
      that this would  not  give  rise  to  excessive  delay  in  the  final
      determination of the claim.


  51) This decision  has  the  intriguing  feature  that,  having  proceeded
      through the various stages of the CJEU in close (though  not  precise)
      proximity to those of Abdullahi, the consideration that  Puid  adopted
      mutatis mutandis the test devised in NS and ME  does  not  feature  in
      Abdullahi,  where  judgment  was  delivered  less  than   four   weeks
      subsequently.


  52) At this juncture, in an ever thickening plot, we switch the  spotlight
      back to Abdullahi.  There the Grand Chamber's formulation of the "only
      way" test in [60] is followed immediately by:


           "......: See the NS (Afghanistan) case, paragraphs 94 and 106
           and Federal Republic of Germany  v  Puid ........ paragraph 30."




      The conundrum which arises is that neither NS and MR nor Puid, in  the
      specified paragraphs, or anywhere else in  the  text,  formulates  the
      "only way" test espoused by the Grand Chamber in Abdullahi.


  53) At this juncture, we record Mr Drabble's  submission,  based  on  this
      decision, that the cause of the legal inhibition on  transfer  is  not
      relevant.  Rather, the question to be determined  is  how  the  Dublin
      Regulation hierarchy is to be operated where such inhibition has  been
      held to exist.




      The Decision in Hamad and Ararso


  54) In R (Hamad and Ararso) v Secretary of State for the  Home  Department
      [2015] EWHC 2511 (Admin), the Secretary of State made a  certification
      decision in respect of the two Claimants,  a  Libyan  citizen  and  an
      Ethiopian citizen, proposing to transfer both to Malta, being  the  EU
      Member State of first entry. Mr Hamad, prior to travelling from  Malta
      to the United Kingdom, had not claimed asylum.  In contrast, Mr Ararso
      had made an unsuccessful asylum claim in Malta.  Mr Hamad claimed that
      compulsory transfer to Malta would infringe his rights under Article 4
      of the Charter.  In the case of Mr Ararso, the Charter rights  invoked
      were Article 4, Article 18 and Article 19(2).  One  of  the  arguments
      advanced was that where it can be demonstrated that the host state  is
      incapable of guaranteeing the claimant's rights under Article 18, this
      suffices to found a successful challenge to the proposed transfer: the
      Article 4 test need not be satisfied.  (See [98] - [100].)


  55) The Administrative Court made the following series of conclusions:


   i) There was no sufficient evidential basis for finding a real risk  that
      Mr Hamad would be  refouled  from  Malta  to  Libya  or  would  suffer
      infringement of his Article 4 rights in Malta. Further,  the  evidence
      did not establish that Mr Hamad would  be  unable  to  seek  effective
      redress: see [122].


  ii) The evidence supported the  conclusion  that  the  Maltese  system  of
      adjudication of asylum applications both  at  first  instance  and  on
      appeal, though imperfect,  was  "....  adequate  to  provide  judicial
      protection and an effective remedy in the generality  of  cases":  see
      [123].


 iii) Neither the possibility of Mr Ararso being prosecuted  and  imprisoned
      for the commission of a criminal offence upon his irregular  departure
      from Malta,  nor  his  inability  to  satisfy  the  Maltese  statutory
      requirements  governing  a  fresh  asylum   claim   amounted   to   an
      infringement of his rights under Articles 1, 4, 18, 19 or  47  of  the
      Charter: see [124] - [125].


      The Court made the following omnibus conclusion, at [127]:


           "For those reasons, I reach the same conclusion in  relation  to
           conditions in Malta as that reached by the Upper Tribunal in the
           Hagos case: the evidence does not  rebut  the  presumption  that
           Malta  will  comply  with   its   relevant   international   law
           obligations.  Nor are there any  circumstances  present  in  the
           cases  of  these  two  individual  claimants  which  lead  to  a
           different conclusion.


      We interpose the comment that, to our knowledge, under the guise of GA
      (Ethiopia) & YH (Libya), an uncompleted attempt to secure permission
      to the Court of Appeal continues.




      The Decision in Pour


  56) The next in the series of decided cases to be considered is Pour  (And
      Others) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2016]  EWHC  401
      (Admin).  This case concerned three Iranian nationals who travelled to
      the  United  Kingdom  having  unsuccessfully  claimed  asylum  in  the
      Republic of Cyprus.  The  determination  of  the  Secretary  of  State
      entailed  a  refusal   to   decide   their   renewed   asylum   claims
      substantively, the statutory certification  of  such  claims  on  safe
      third country grounds and the proposed transfer of  the  Claimants  to
      Cyprus, being the Member State responsible for examining their  claims
      under Dublin III. The Secretary of State's decisions  were  challenged
      on the ground, inter alia, that there was a real risk of the Claimants
      being refouled from Cyprus to Iran in contravention  of  their  rights
      under Article 19 of the Charter. As appears from [40] of the  judgment
      of Ouseley J, the question  which  the  Court  had  to  determine  was
      whether the  only  legal  mechanism  for  successfully  challenging  a
      transfer decision under the Dublin Regulation was the demonstration of
      a real risk of an infringement of the Claimants' rights  under  either
      Article 4 or Article 19 of the Charter.


  57) The Administrative Court's first conclusion was  that,  based  on  the
      evidence, the Claimants had failed  to  demonstrate  a  real  risk  of
      refoulement from Cyprus to Iran: see [99] -  [106].   This  conclusion
      disposed of the Claimants' challenge under Article 19 of the  Charter.
      The Court nonetheless proceeded to consider certain  further,  related
      contentions of the Claimants, including the submission that Cyprus was
      in breach of the relevant EU Directives.  Having noted, at [108], that
      this is a task for the CJEU and not a domestic court, albeit the issue
      could arise in (essentially) a collateral fashion, Ouseley  J,  having
      considered the substance of  the  case  made,  reached  the  following
      conclusion, at [125]:


           "Accordingly, I am satisfied that even if  there  have  been  or
           were to be breaches of the Directives, there  is  no  real  risk
           that the Claimants, if returned to Iran from Cyprus, would  have
           been refouled there.  It  follows  too  that  the  inclusion  of
           Cyprus  on  the  list  of  safe  third  countries  involves   no
           incompatibility with the ECHR."


  58) Bearing in mind the thrust of  the  Applicants'  challenge,  the  most
      significant passages in the judgment of  Ouseley  J  begin  at  [171],
      where His Lordship undertakes an assessment of the question of:


           "....  How the relationship of  EU  law  and  the  CEAS  to  the
           requirements of  the  ECHR  works  out  in  relation  to  Dublin
           returns."


      Continuing, the Judge states, at [171]:


           "There are two possible answers: (1) the CJEU  decisions  should
           be regarded as providing an answer only in relation to Article 3
           ECHR and Article 4/19  CFR,  and  despite  the  clarity  of  the
           language, not dealing with the position in relation to  breaches
           of other Articles; (2) the CJEU  intended  Article  3  ECHR  and
           Articles 4/19 CFR breaches alone to warrant  refusal  of  return
           under Dublin II."


      He continues, at [172]:


           "My view is that, although Abdullahi was not  cited  in  R(B)  v
           SSHD, R(B) v SSHD decides by necessary  implication  that  other
           Articles of the ECHR and CFR than 3 and 4  respectively  can  be
           prayed in aid to prevent  Dublin  II  returns.  Article  52  CFR
           permits the CJEU jurisprudence under CFR to  progress  with  the
           ECHR jurisprudence. The CJEU has not addressed the  issue  head-
           on, but the way it confines its judgments to the issues it faces
           directly, means that it should not be taken to have decided  the
           point."

      The judge's reasoning is expressed in the next  succeeding  paragraph,
at [173]:

           "Compliance with Dublin II, if even a flagrant breach  of  other
           Articles were irrelevant, could put a Member State in breach  of
           the ECHR in order to comply with its EU obligations. I  find  it
           very difficult to suppose that the CJEU, while insisting on  the
           primacy of  the  Community  legal  order,  would  reach  such  a
           conclusion rather than align itself in practical effect, even if
           expressing its tests in different ways, with  the  jurisprudence
           of  Strasbourg.  It  could  not  rule  out  for   all   possible
           circumstances, that other Articles of  the  CFR  might  lawfully
           preclude  the  operation  of  Dublin  returns.  The  CJEU  would
           emphasise the mutual confidence which Member  States  have,  and
           the redress available through directly applicable law, and adopt
           a further, stronger but analogous distinction between EU  Member
           States and other Council of Europe states when  considering  the
           practical strength in the presumption of compliance."


  59) Faithful to the doctrine of precedent, the judge continues, at  [175]-
      [176]:


           "It would be wrong to interpret  NS/Abdullahi  as  holding  that
           breaches of Directives, however widespread, but  which  did  not
           amount to flagrant breaches of fundamental rights should prevent
           returns under Dublin. It is the relationship between breaches of
           the Directives and breaches of fundamental  rights  which  would
           engage the CFR, and it is that which would lead  to  the  return
           breaching the Dublin Regulation


           [176] Second, the  CJEU  has  given  no  indication,  quite  the
           reverse, that it would itself contemplate  an  approach  to  CFR
           rights which was more favourable  to  the  individual  than  the
           ECtHR's. Whatever language it chose to use, if it were to  allow
           breaches of Articles other than 4 and 19 CFR  to  affect  Dublin
           returns in the CEAS, the effect would be no less demanding  than
           the flagrant breach test, which would  rarely  be  proved  in  a
           Member  State.  EU  jurisprudence  would  march  in  step   with
           Strasbourg's, and neither lag behind nor  outpace  it.  Systemic
           breaches,  as  a  sufficient  condition,  though  not  always  a
           necessary one, will prevent removal in the case  of  Article  4,
           because that will show that in the general run of cases that the
           risk of a breach of Article 4 is real. That language is confined
           to that Article. A systemic breach cannot of itself  suffice  to
           show that the breach of other Articles is flagrant,  a  complete
           nullification of their essence."


      Based on this  reasoning,  the  judge  then  expresses  the  following
      conclusion, at [177]:


           "Accordingly, I accept that it is open to the Claimants to  show
           that their Article 5 ECHR and Article  6  CFR  rights  would  be
           flagrantly breached by return to Cyprus. But that is a very hard
           task to show because of the significant  evidential  presumption
           of compliance."


      We record here Mr Drabble's submission that the decision  in  Pour  is
      not  determinative  of  the  present  challenges  since  it  concerned
      provisions of the Charter other than Article 18.




      The Decision in R (B)


  60) The jurisprudence belonging to this field has been organic in  nature.
      A review of the leading decisions  considered  in  this  judgment  was
      undertaken by the Court of Appeal in R (B) v Secretary  of  State  for
      the Home Department [2016] EWCA Civ 854.  There the Court identified a
      clear dichotomy of removals challenged on the ground of Articles 2  or
      3 ECHR (on the one hand) and  challenges  based  on  other  Convention
      Rights (on the other), the latter category of case engaging  the  more
      elevated threshold of flagrant breach: see [19] - [21].   Notably,  in
      Pour (supra), Ouseley J was of the view that the Court of  Appeal  had
      decided "by necessary implication" that removal  decisions  under  the
      Dublin Regulation can be challenged  by  invoking  Charter  provisions
      other than Articles 3 and 4: see [72].



      The Decision in Dudaev


  61) Next, there is the decision in Dudaev & Ors v The Secretary  of  State
      for the Home Department [2015] EWHC 1641 (Admin).   This  is  a  first
      instance decision.  The judgment of Burnett LJ contains  an  admirable
      review  of  the  governing  legal  framework  applicable   to   Dublin
      Regulation cases.  In  [55]  His  Lordship  noted  that  the  test  in
      Abdullahi had been expressed by the CJEU "with  conspicuous  clarity".
      Other issues, of no direct relevance in the  context  of  the  present
      challenge, were addressed and determined.  We note in  particular  the
      following passage in [78]:

           "[In Sweden] there is a system which allows  fresh  applications
           supported if necessary  with  court  orders  preventing  removal
           pending their resolution.  Should  it  be  necessary,  there  is
           access to Strasbourg with every expectation  that  Sweden  would
           abide by  any  interim  measures  indicated  by  the  Strasbourg
           Court."


      The judicial review application was dismissed.




      Abdulkadir

  62) We complete our review of the European and domestic  jurisprudence  by
      considering a recent first instance decision,  that  of  Abdulkadir  v
      Secretary of State for the Home Department [2016] EWHC  1504  (Admin).
      There  each  of   the   claimants,   challenging   clearly   unfounded
      certifications  by  the  Secretary  of  State,  contended  that  their
      enforced removal to Austria,  which  had  accepted  that  it  was  the
      responsible Member State under the  Dublin  Regulation,  would  expose
      them to a substantial risk of  inhuman  or  degrading  treatment  and,
      further, would be in contravention of Article 18 of the Charter.  This
      threw up the question of whether Article 18  was  justiciable  at  the
      suit of the claimants, focusing attention on Article 27 of the  Dublin
      Regulation.


  63)  Irwin J concluded as follows, at [141]:


           "Article 27 stipulates there must be a proper procedure  for  an
           individual to challenge transfer. However, it does not  seem  to
           me to broaden the proper basis for such a challenge.  The  whole
           thrust of the Dublin Regulation is  to  determine  where  asylum
           claims are to be decided, on the basis  they  will  be  properly
           decided by the member state receiving an asylum  claimant  under
           the arrangements. I do not see any compelling  argument  derived
           from Article 27 to the effect that individuals may  litigate  to
           prevent their transfer on a broader ground than before."

      The Judge also laid emphasis on the narrow confines of  the  Abdullahi
      test and its conjunctive requirements, impelling the  conclusion  that
      the demonstration only of systemic deficiencies in asylum procedure in
      the host state would not suffice to render a transfer unlawful,  given
      that the test incorporates the second, separate  element  of  systemic
      deficiencies in the state's reception conditions for asylum  claimants
      providing substantial grounds for apprehending a breach of  Article  4
      of the Charter.

(72)  It is  convenient  to  record  here  the  discrete  submission  of  Mr
      Manknell which highlighted the holding of Irwin J, at [145]  -  [147],
      that it is not open to a claimant to rely on  Article  18  as  a  free
      standing right.  It would appear that this is the only decision, first
      instance or appellate, which has addressed this  specific  issue.   We
      return to this point in [86] infra.


(X)   OUR CONCLUSIONS


   1) It seems to us that the chief ingredients of the foundation upon which
      the Applicants' case is advanced are, in brief  compass,  as  follows.
      In  the  event  of  their  enforced  return  to  Malta,   they   will,
      predictively, endeavour to pursue  fresh  asylum  claims.   This  will
      trigger, under Article 18 of the Charter, a right to determination  of
      such  claims  within  a  reasonable  time  and  according  to  a  fair
      procedure.  It is said that they will be denied these  rights  because
      of the shortcomings in  the  Maltese  asylum  system,  which  contains
      procedures that are either illusory or too slow.  Their  fate,  it  is
      argued, will be that of "indefinite limbo" (per Mr  Drabble)  with  an
      associated, or consequential, risk of unlawful refoulement.  The  twin
      components  of  the  evidential  substratum  upon  which  this  future
      scenario  is  canvassed  are  the  circumstances  of  their   previous
      unsuccessful asylum claims in Malta and the expert evidence.


  64) We agree with Mr Manknell that the evidence of  the  Applicants'  past
      experiences in Malta is sparse.    Only  one  of  the  Applicants  (Mr
      Karada) has made a witness statement and  this  is  notably  light  in
      detail. There is nothing from Mr Hassan.  The  only  other  evidential
      source of substance in this respect, leaving to one  side  the  expert
      evidence, is what is contained in the pre-action protocol letters.  We
      also take into account that the  Applicants'  assertions  about  their
      previous experiences in Malta are untested.


  65)  The  evidence  bearing  on  this  historical  issue  is,   therefore,
      unsatisfactory.  However, we propose to  take  it  at  its  reasonable
      zenith for present purposes. Having adopted this point  of  departure,
      we make clear our view that if it lies within our competence to decide
      whether the previous asylum claim in Malta  of  either  Applicant  was
      determined in a manner compatible with Article 18  of  the    Charter,
      which competence we seriously doubt but do not  need  to  decide,  the
      evidence bearing on this issue is  so  impoverished  that  a  negative
      answer would be swiftly supplied.


  66) One of the most important features  of  the  Applicants'  evidence  of
      their past experiences in Malta is its vintage.  The events which they
      describe occurred some four  to  five  years  ago.   As  the  evidence
      summarised in Hagos makes clear, there have been  significant  changes
      in the relevant conditions in Malta during recent years.  In Hagos,  a
      decision promulgated just over one year ago, this Tribunal stated,  at
      [36]:


           "As our summary of the evidence ... demonstrates, time  has  not
           stood still on the island of Malta.  With each passing year, the
           notional graph has  been  one  of  gradual  improvement  in  the
           conditions and processes for the  reception,  accommodation  and
           general treatment of asylum applicants  and  the  processing  of
           their protection claims."


      Having accepted the real possibility that the Applicant would seek  to
      re-open the earlier refusal decision or make a fresh  application  for
      asylum,  the  Tribunal  embarked   upon   the   following   evaluative
      prediction, at [53]:


            "It is appropriate to emphasise that, in this future  scenario,
           the  Applicant  will  have  had  the  benefit  of  his  previous
           experience and any lessons to be learned thereby.   Furthermore,
           he has been in receipt  of  relevant  legal  advice  during  his
           sojourn in the United Kingdom.  The  services  provided  by  his
           lawyers here have included direct contact with the JRSM.   As  a
           result, the  Applicant's  particular  case  now  has  a  certain
           profile. It is to be expected that his solicitors will alert the
           JRSM to the Applicant's return to Malta.  We consider it  highly
           likely that in this scenario and assuming that the Applicant  is
           detained afresh to be prosecuted and/or following conviction, he
           will have access to the JRSM and will receive legal  advice  and
           support in pursuing one or more of the options identified above.
            Furthermore, it is probable that the Applicant will be  further
           assisted in the presentation of his claim by the availability of
           the written statement and written  representations  prepared  by
           his English solicitors."


      This gave rise to the conclusion  that  the  Applicant  would  not  be
      denied a procedurally fair decision making process.




  67) We consider that, in substance and reality, the only feature of  these
      Applicants' cases which differs from that of  Mr  Hagos  is  the  JRSM
      factor.  Whereas the evidence in Hagos established that there had been
      direct contact between the English solicitors and the JRSM,  there  is
      no comparable evidence in this case.  However, there is  every  reason
      to expect that the experienced solicitors  who  have  represented  the
      Applicants so competently in these proceedings will  take  the  simple
      step of making the necessary contact with either the JRSM or the other
      NGO which provides comparable services to asylum applicants  in  Malta
      (or both) - or, as a minimum, equipping the Applicants to  do  so.  We
      are not deflected from this conclusion by the rather limited  evidence
      bearing provided by the Applicants' solicitor.  Furthermore, both  the
      Applicants and their English solicitors have the considerable  benefit
      of the detailed treatise of Maltese asylum law, systems and procedures
      contained in the evidence of their  experts  and  set  forth  in  this
      judgment.  This  evidence  is  infused  with  practical  insights  and
      observations of which the Applicants and their English solicitors will
      be able to avail.


  68) We accept that, viewed from the perspective of the  notional  paradigm
      asylum handling process, there will be imperfections in the processing
      of any future renewed asylum claims by the Applicants in  Malta.   For
      example, the conditions under  which  there  will  be  access  to  the
      Applicants' asylum files would be considered unsatisfactory by English
      lawyers.  Furthermore, the legal advice and representation  facilities
      which we anticipate will, as a matter of probability, be available  to
      them may not be as extensive as those prevailing in this jurisdiction.
       However, the evidence supports the view  that  the  Applicants  will,
      more  probably  than  not,  have  the  benefit  of  legal  advice  and
      representation. Furthermore, the Applicants' experts  do  not  suggest
      that factors of the aforementioned kind give rise  to  an  endemically
      and incurably unfair and substandard decision making process.


  69) One of the cornerstones of Mr Drabble's  submissions  was  that  fresh
      asylum claims on behalf of the Applicants are likely  to  generate  an
      inadmissibility decision and  that  the  right  to  challenge  such  a
      decision by appeal  is  illusory.  We  reject  both  aspects  of  this
      submission.  First, while we are prepared to accept, in their  favour,
      that it is more likely than not that both Applicants will pursue fresh
      asylum applications, the suggestion that this will  inevitably  result
      in  inadmissibility   decisions   lacks   the   necessary   evidential
      foundation. It is purely speculative.


  70) In this context,  while  we  do  not  overlook  that  the  Applicants'
      apparent (though unsubstantiated) limited knowledge and  understanding
      of the original asylum refusal decisions will have some bearing on the
      formulation  of  their  new  claims  we  would  emphasise  again   the
      predictive probability that they will have the benefit of legal advice
      and representation, coupled  with  some  support  from  their  English
      lawyers prior to their departure from  this  country  (at  least)  and
      aided by the insights, information and illumination provided by  their
      experts' report and this judgment.  In the absence of any evidence  of
      what the content and thrust of  their  fresh  asylum  applications  is
      likely to consist, we decline to adopt  the  purely  speculative  view
      that an inadmissibility decision by the RC is the likely outcome.   To
      this we would add that we are unable to distil from Article 18 of  the
      Charter any right to pursue a subsequent  asylum  application  or  any
      right to have a first, or subsequent, asylum application determined in
      accordance with  a  process  which  does  not  have  an  admissibility
      threshold.


  71) Furthermore, if  a  refusal  of  any  fresh  asylum  claim  by  either
      Applicant were to eventuate, there is no  basis  for  concluding  that
      this would infringe any procedural  element  of  rights  conferred  by
      Article 18 of the Charter.   We  consider  that  this  aspect  of  the
      Applicants' case, properly  exposed,  involves  crystal  ball  gazing.
      Moreover, the expert evidence, which we accept, is to the effect  that
      the strict time limit of 15 days is unlikely  to  be  applied  to  the
      detriment of either Applicant: see [34] above. In addition, while  the
      experts describe the exercise involved in  a  fresh  asylum  claim  as
      "fairly difficult",  the  immediately  succeeding  passages  in  their
      report, [55] - [56], drawing on the most authoritative Maltese  source
      available, demonstrate that new claims are capable of  succeeding.  To
      this we add two matters. First, the uncontested  statistical  evidence
      that new claims have been gradually increasing  during  recent  years.
      Second, as emphasised in Dudaev, it is essential to bear in mind  that
      the Applicants will  have  access  to  the  Strasbourg  court  via  an
      application for interim protective measures.


  72) The final, discrete ingredient in Mr Drabble's submission involves the
      contention that there is in substance no right of  appeal  against  an
      inadmissibility decision.  While we have  rejected  the  premise  upon
      which this contention is constructed   we  would  add  the  following.
      First, we note the evidence, uncontested, that unsuccessful subsequent
      asylum claimants are informed of both the decision and the  mechanisms
      for challenging same.  Second, there is an automatic  review  of  such
      decisions by the RAB.  Third, an appeal lies to the RAB on safe  third
      country grounds. Fourth, there is the legal remedy of a  challenge  in
      the Maltese Civil Court, exercising is constitutional jurisdiction, on
      the basis of  an  alleged  violation  of  a  fundamental  human  right
      protected under either the  Constitution  of  Malta  or  the  European
      Convention Act.   Fifth,  there  is  the  remedy  of  a  challenge  by
      proceedings  in  the  Maltese  Administrative  Tribunal,  from   whose
      decisions an appeal lies to the Court of  Appeal.   We  consider  that
      these factors operate to confound Mr Drabble's submission.


  73)  We take into account the experts'  opinion  that  there  are  certain
      limitations attendant upon these various  avenues  of  legal  redress.
      However, we find the evidence insufficient to warrant  the  conclusion
      that these are purely illusory or theoretical.  Furthermore, we  would
      not be prepared  to  hold,  absent  clear  binding  authority  to  the
      contrary, that  the  limitations  of  these  mechanisms  (as  we  have
      diagnosed them) for legal challenge to a decision by the RC  rejecting
      a later asylum claim as inadmissible give rise  to  a  breach  of  any
      procedural right under Article 18 of the Charter. We  also  take  into
      account the emphasis in Dudaev on the available mechanism of resort to
      the ECtHR and an application for interim relief.


  74) The Applicants' "indefinite future limbo" contention is, in our  view,
      further defeated by the clear evidence relating to the decision making
      processes of the RC and RAB, considered in tandem  with  the  relevant
      statutory provisions.  These sources provide no warrant for concluding
      that any future asylum application of either  Applicant  would  suffer
      the fate of indefinite drift in a sea of extensive inertia  and  delay
      on the part of any of the authorities concerned.


  75) For the reasons elaborated above we  reject  the  first  limb  of  the
      Applicants' case.  It follows, in our judgment, that  the  second  and
      sequential limb of the Applicants' case, which involves  a  predictive
      real risk of unlawful refoulement to their countries of origin must be
      rejected.  This aspect of the Applicants' challenge is  based  on  the
      contention that unlawful refoulement will be the  consequence  of  the
      suggested future infringements of the procedural dimension of  Article
      18. The two elements of the challenge  are  inextricably  intertwined.
      As we have rejected the primary component of the challenge  this,  the
      remaining, element must founder accordingly.


  76) In making our findings and conclusions above, we have been prepared to
      assume that the proposed transfer of a third country  asylum  claimant
      to another Member State under the Dublin Regulation for the purpose of
      examining their claim can  be  challenged  under  Article  18  of  the
      Charter.  While we are mindful of [141] - [148] of  Abdulkadir,  there
      is evidently no binding decision in which this issue has been  decided
      to date.  Ultimately, a reference to the CJEU  under  Article  267  of
      TFEU in a suitable case  may  be  the  appropriate  course.   We  have
      conducted a  detailed  examination  of  the  Luxembourg  and  domestic
      jurisprudence bearing on this interesting  issue.   In  contrast  with
      Irwin J, our close analysis of the decision in Abdullahi  suggests  to
      us that this decision does not provide a clear and  conclusive  answer
      to the question.  The superficially conclusive nature of the  decision
      in Abdullahi  is  questioned  both  by  our  analysis  above  and  the
      decisions in EM (Eritrea), R (B), and Pour.  In this  respect  we  are
      inclined to align ourselves with the reasoning of  Ouseley  J  in  the
      latter case.


  77) Finally, we address  briefly  the  self-evidently  elevated  "flagrant
      breach" threshold.  We have adverted to this in  the  context  of  our
      consideration of the decision of the Court of Appeal in R (B).   Given
      our analysis, findings and conclusions  above  it  is  unnecessary  to
      decide this discrete issue.  However, in deference  to  the  arguments
      advanced and considering the importance of the issue, we  would  offer
      the following observations.


  78) This is another issue which belongs to the interface  between  EU  and
      ECHR law.  There is no authority, European or domestic, in point.   In
      Pour,  the  "flagrant  breach"  threshold  was  assumed,  rather  than
      analysed and decided.  Furthermore, the doctrine of precedent does not
      bind the Upper Tribunal,  in  its  judicial  review  jurisdiction,  to
      follow decisions of the Administrative Court.  The correct analysis is
      that these two organs exercise coordinate jurisdiction.  See Secretary
      of State for Justice v RB [2010] UKUT 454 (AAC) at (86) - (95).


  79) Article 18 of the Charter has no sister provision in the ECHR.  On the
      assumption that as regards Charter rights and freedoms the CJEU  would
      adopt the ECtHR dichotomy noted above, we would observe,  first,  that
      Article 18 finds  its  home  in  one  of  the  supreme  constitutional
      instruments of the EU legal order, namely the Charter.  Second,  while
      recognising that there is obvious scope for more detailed scrutiny  of
      this issue, we cannot overlook that all of  the  rights  and  freedoms
      enshrined in the Charter, the Pandora's box in its entirety, have been
      accorded the  status  and  denomination  of  "fundamental".   This  we
      readily recognise is not decisive per se and, indeed is another  issue
      which may foreseeably attract more detailed scrutiny  in  some  future
      case.

  80) Our third observation is that the most cursory of reflections  on  the
      history and rationale of the right  to  asylum  in  the  modern  world
      suggests that it belongs to an elevated plane.  It is a right to  lead
      one's life free of the pernicious, unremitting and  invasive  evil  of
      persecution.   We  consider  it  uncontroversial   to   suggest   that
      persecution permeates,  devalues  and  contaminates  indefinitely  the
      lives of its victims.  It does so by attacking core  elements,  rights
      and freedoms of the lives of human beings to which all signatories  of
      the Refugee  Convention  and  its  associated  EU  measures  subscribe
      without reservation.

  81) Decisions under the Refugee  Convention  and  related  instruments  of
      domestic and EU law frequently involve issues  of  life,  liberty  and
      torture. These are all fundamental  rights  which  the  Convention  is
      designed to protect.  Furthermore, persecution may be actuated by more
      than one of the proscribed  grounds.  It  is  well  settled  that  the
      principle of anxious scrutiny applies in this field.   Other  features
      of asylum decision making include the special standard  of  proof  and
      the flexible approach to the reception of evidence.  The  impetus  for
      claiming asylum is not infrequently catastrophic events in one's  home
      country - war, genocide, military insurrection and civil war  to  name
      but some. The context in which the Refugee Convention was  adopted  is
      well known. Furthermore, the importance of asylum law is such that  it
      has occupied the attention of the highest Courts in the United Kingdom
      in a large number of cases, beginning with Bugdaycay  v  Secretary  of
      State for the Home Department [1987] AC 514.  There is also  the  well
      established principle that having  regard  to  the  potentially  grave
      consequences of removing refugee protection from  a  beneficiary,  the
      exclusion clauses in the Refugee  Convention  are  to  be  interpreted
      restrictively and applied with caution.


  82)  While  recognising  that  this  issue  is  worthy  of  more  detailed
      examination in a suitable future case, even the brief  treatise  which
      we have undertaken above suggests strongly that the "flagrant  breach"
      test cannot be the correct one. We see much force in the argument that
      this test would so weaken and erode  the  protection  of  this  vital,
      internationally recognised human right, particularly in the context of
      the CEAS and its underlying rationale and ethos, that it cannot simply
      be exported from the ECHR machinery of Strasbourg, where the right  to
      asylum does not exist, to the EU arena wherein, by virtue  of  Article
      18 of the Charter and other legislative measures the right  to  asylum
      occupies a prominent position.


  83) We, therefore, favour the view that in cases where a proposed transfer
      under the Dublin Regulation for the purpose  of  examining  an  asylum
      claim is opposed under Article 18 of  the  Charter,  the  test  to  be
      applied is whether there is a real risk that a  breach  of  the  right
      protected by Article 18 will occur.  By  parity  of  reasoning  -  and
      acknowledging  that  this  further  issue  does  not  arise  in  these
      proceedings - this would also appear to be the correct test  in  cases
      involving other fundamental Charter rights, such as Articles 3,  4,  5
      and 19.


  84) As appears from our findings and conclusions above,  the  adoption  of
      the less stringent of the two competing tests does not avail either of
      the Applicants.



DECISION

  85) On the grounds and for the reasons elaborated above  we  dismiss  this
      application for judicial review.

                                                                       [pic]

                        Summary of Objective Evidence


The following  summary  takes  each  report  in  chronological  order,  thus
beginning with the last report in bundle ACB and working towards the  front,
with focus on the evidence contemporary  with  the  Applicants'  arrival  in
Malta and the processing of their asylum claims (i.e.  early  2011  to  late
2012).

Council of Europe Committee for the Prevention of Torture ('CPT'), December
2008, p. B668-749, based on a visit in May 2008

Material Conditions for Immigration Detainees
B688  Material conditions for immigration detainees in several parts of  the
      detention centres were "poor" or  "very  poor,"  and  "could  well  be
      considered to amount to inhuman or degrading treatment."

B689  Lyster Barracks  immigration  detention  centre,  Hermes  Block:  very
      dilapidated, dirty, infested  with  rats;  practically  impossible  to
      ensure basic standards of hygiene, detainees could not drink the water
      without getting ill.

B689  Lyster Barracks tent compound  "rudimentary",  no  insulation  against
      heat or  cold,  CPT  called  for  urgent  replacement  with  a  proper
      building.

B690   Safi  Barracks  had  some  improvements,  but   still   some   "poor"
      conditions.

B690  Ta' Kandja police complex housing  60  immigrants  remained  "a  cage-
      like, grim and oppressive place", severely  overcrowded,  dry-rot  and
      mould inside dormitories, dilapidated toilets and showers, 22 hours  a
      day inside dormitories.

Access to the asylum procedure
B693  "Vast majority" of detainees interviewed said they had never  received
      or seen the information leaflet on asylum procedures which is supposed
      to be distributed on arrival (in English, French, Arabic).

B694  Letters can be sent and received and  telephone  cards  for  payphones
      provided free of charge, but detainees not allowed mobiles, and  there
      were no visit facilities. Visits took place at the entrance gate.

in detention centres from August 2008 to February 2009

B637  Map shows the 3 detention centres and the Marsa Open Centre.

B638  "Appalling" living conditions and "serious barriers"  to  health  care
      endanger physical and mental health of  detainees.  Poor  hygiene  and
      inadequate  shelter  cause   skin   &   respiratory   infections   and
      overcrowding  spreads  epidemics.  Poor  quality   health   care   has
      "significant and potentially long-term impact on detainees' health."

B643  Ever since began working in detention centres, have  witnessed  living
      conditions falling "far below" those  required  by  EU  Directive,  UN
      minimum standards and Maltese law.

JRS Malta, 'A report on a pilot study on destitution amongst the migrant
community in Malta' in partnership with IOM and UNHCR, March 2010, pp. B615-
B630, based on a study from Sept 2009 - Feb 2010

Study looks into the  causes  of  destitution  amongst  migrants  in  Malta.
Identifies:
B622  No consistent criteria for  continuation/discontinuation  of  material
assistance;
B622  Assistance (provided by the Agency for the Welfare of  Asylum-Seekers,
      'AWAS') is tied to accommodation;
B624  Accommodation is  inadequate,  particularly  for  those  with  medical
needs;
B622  There is extreme difficulty re-accessing assistance if one  leaves  to
      find/pursue work which is later lost;
B623   The  amount  of  assistance  provided  to  recipients  of  subsidiary
      protection  (as  opposed  to  refugee  status)   is   inadequate   for
      subsistence;
      Dublin returnees  with  subsidiary  protection  have  their  allowance
      reduced;
      Recipients of subsidiary protection (as  opposed  to  refugee  status)
      have no access to free healthcare or medicines;
B624  Study notes that beneficiaries of subsidiary protection  are  entitled
      to core welfare benefits under  the  EU  Qualifiction  Directive,  but
      implication is that they don't receive them ("upon losing  their  job,
      they can no longer pay the rent and have no alternative but to try  to
      be readmitted in the AWAS ... many  migrants  in  this  situation  are
      beneficiaries of subsidiary protection and are therefore  entitled  to
      "core welfare benefits" according to the EU Qualification Directive."
B625  Asylum-seekers and recipients of subsidiary protection have  no  clear
      entitlement to education. But they are more immediately concerned with
      securing basic subsistence

JRS Malta, 'Becoming Vulnerable in Detention', June 2010, based on research
Feb - Sept 2009, pp. B599-B614

B601   Outline  of  detention  policy:  eight   facilities   for   detaining
      immigrants in 3 locations within army or police barracks [c.f. map  at
      B637]. Boat arrivals are immediately detained. National law  does  not
      limit detention, which lasts 12 months for those whose application  is
      still pending, and 18 months for those who have been  refused  asylum.
      Those identified as vulnerable are not detained.

B602  After the study, the Italian navy agreed an  interception  and  return
      policy with Libya, thus the numbers of arrivals in Malta  dropped  off
      significantly and centres were far less crowded by June 2010.

Information and contact with outside world
B606  Most people did not know why they were being detained or how  long  it
      would last. This caused frustration, anger and worry (c.f. p.  B609  -
      cause of sleeplessness).

B609  Telephone access was "very limited",  visits  allowed  from  NGOs  and
      lawyers but not from family or friends.  Limitation  on  contact  with
      outside world was mainly caused by lack  of  internet  and  inadequate
      provision of telephone and calling cards.

Detention of vulnerable persons
B610  Policy not to detain the  vulnerable  was  not  effected  due  to  the
      automatic detention of all migrants pending a vulnerability assessment
      that could take months.

Amnesty International, 'Seeking Safety, Finding Fear', December 2010, pp.
      B587-598

Refoulement at sea
B588  AI highlights the case of a stricken vessel in July  2010  from  which
      the Maltese authorities took 28 passengers, leaving 27 to be picked up
      by a Libyan vessel. The asylum-seekers returned to Libya were detained
      and beaten/tortured by the Libyan authorities.

B589  Malta denied that it had duties to the returned asylum  seekers  which
      it abandoned in this "and other similar incidents". AI considered that
      Malta had power over the passengers on board the stricken  vessel  and
      thus did have duties to ensure full  and  fair  access  to  an  asylum
      procedure, and of non-refoulement.

B590  AI expresses "deep concern"  over  the  agreement  between  Libya  and
      Italy that resulted in vessels being returned to Libya.

Deficiencies in the asylum procedure
B594  "Inadequate" screening of vulnerability and provision for their  needs
      of the vulnerable
      Lack of effective remedies for detention

B595  Open-ended removal orders allow for  removal  months  or  years  after
      arrival, while the right to challenge removal can only be exercised in
      a limited timeframe. "In practice, a challenge at point of enforcement
      is often impossible."

B596  AI has concerns about the effectiveness  of  appeal  against  negative
      asylum decisions. Negative decisions are "not  sufficiently  reasoned,
      depriving rejected asylum-seekers  of  the  opportunity  to  challenge
      successfully the decision."
      Asylum-seekers and lawyers "are not granted full access  to  the  case
      file."
      RAB hearings are in private and are reported to have reversed  only  4
      decisions between 2002 and 2008.

Material conditions in open centres
B596   Residents  of  open  centres  complained  of,   "overcrowding,   poor
      sanitation, the lack  of  privacy  and  the  absence  of  recreational
      activities."

      Amnesty International "saw  the  deplorable  conditions"  at  Hal  Far
      Hangar and Tent Village, jointly  housing  over  1,000  people.  16-20
      people live in each metal container with no running water. "No  proper
      sanitation"; only 15 toilets and showers in each centre.


      Most residents cannot find employment. The monthly allowance  must  be
      signed for 3 times a week,  far  from  any  commercial  centre,  which
      "further impedes their ability to search for work."
B597   Maltese  authorities  are  actively  trying  to   resettle   refugees
      elsewhere in Europe and the USA but "do not make an effort" to  ensure
      social and economic rights in Malta. Thousands have "a bleak future".

Council of Europe, Commissioner for Human Rights, Thomas Hammarberg, 9  June
2011, following a visit on 23-25 March 2011, pp. ACB B573-B586

Overview
B573    Commissioner   considers   Malta's   detention    policy    to    be
"irreconcilable" with ECHR.
      Some living conditions in open centres  are  "clearly  inadequate  for
      even short periods of time."

      Policy  on  vulnerable  groups  is  "at  variance  with  international
      standards".

B574   "Progress  is  necessary"  in  the   refugee   status   determination
      procedure. Including  the  "need"  to  provide  legal  aid  for  first
      instance proceedings; need to improve access  to  case  files;  Second
      instance proceedings "must be  made  an  effective  tool  for  review,
      notably by improving legal assistance and access of asylum seekers and
      lawyers to case files and through the holding  of  hearings  at  which
      asylum seekers may be present."

      The system of welfare  support  "currently  perpetuates  their  social
      exclusion and leaves them at serious risk of destitution."

      The  Commissioner  was  'seriously  concerned"  about  xenophobia  and
      racism.

      Arrivals in Malta had decreased sharply from mid 2009 when  the  joint
      Italian-Libyan operation began. Only 27  arrivals  in  2010.  However,
      1,100 arrivals in just 2 weeks at the  end  of  March  2011  following
      outbreak of armed conflict in Libya. Currently there were 11,300  non-
      EU citizens in Malta.

B575  "It is  clear  that  due  to  its  small  size,  the  density  of  its
      population and the limited absorption capacity of its  labour  market,
      Malta can offer adequate conditions of reception and opportunities for
      long-term livelihoods to only a fraction of  these  migrants."  Unless
      Europe offers meaningful solidarity and co-operation, there is a  risk
      that migrants "continue to be  prevented  from  fully  enjoying  their
      human rights, and might in some  cases  suffer  serious  human  rights
      violations."

      Malta's human rights responsibilities to migrants "has not been  fully
      met" in spite of some improvements during  the  lull  in  arrivals  in
      2010.

Reception Conditions
B576  As at mid-March 2011,  there  were  only  49  immigrants  detained  in
      Malta, all at Safi Barracks, where conditions were better than in open
      centres, but the Commissioner was concerned about the  impact  of  the
      1,100 people who arrived from Libya in the two weeks after his visit.
      Hal Far  tent  village  housed  600  people  in  "totally  inadequate"
      conditions. Hal Far hangar accommodating 500 reopened after the  visit
      and was "reported to be seriously  sub-standard".  Marsa  Open  Centre
      housing 600 was "somewhat better" but suffered "serious overcrowding".

Refoulement at sea
B578  The Commissioner repeats the  same  views  as  AI  concerning  Malta's
      reliance  on  Libyan  vessels  to  rescue  asylum-seekers   in   2010,
      potentially leading to refoulement.

Refugee Determination Procedure
B578  Number of improvements noted: faster  processing,  better  information
      provision and higher %  of  refugee  status  grants,  but  the  report
      expresses concern about the impact of the Libyan armed conflict (�45).

      However,  "decisions  are  not  sufficiently  reasoned,  which   makes
      challenging them on appeal particularly difficult." (�46)

      RAB proceedings "do not appear to be  effective"  due  to  the  "poor"
      quality of legal aid assistance, "extremely limited"  access  to  case
      files, and the fact that RAB does not hear  from  appellants.  Only  6
      decisions have been overturned by RAB from 2004 to 2011 (�47).

      Mandatory detention results in shortcomings in  the  asylum  procedure
      due to: difficulty obtaining documents  inside  detention;  difficulty
      lodging an appeal in time; the need to rely on detention centre  staff
      or visiting NGOs to lodge documents; refusal of RAB to accept  out-of-
      time appeals (�48).


Durable  Solutions   (including   consequences   of   receiving   subsidiary
      protection)

B579  The Maltese authorities believe that the main  solution  for  migrants
      is to resettle elsewhere in Europe (�54).
      "The possibilities for establishing a new life in Malta are  extremely
      limited for most migrants." (�54).
      Only recognised refugees (not  recipients  of  subsidiary  protection)
      receive benefits on a  par  with  Maltese  nationals.  The  system  of
      support for asylum-seekers and beneficiaries of subsidiary  protection
      "effectively marginalises and  perpetuates  the  social  exclusion  of
      migrants." (�56).
      Jobs are seasonal and/or very precarious, but the  majority  of  those
      with subsidiary protection have no access to unemployment benefits "in
      the likely case that they become unemployed." (�57).
      Maltese practice was "difficult to reconcile"  with  the  requirements
      of EU and Maltese law (�58).
      Many of  the  difficulties  that  migrants  face  are  underpinned  by
      embedded racist and xenophobic attitudes" (�62).

Council of Europe CPT, Report on its visit of 26-30 September 2011,  4  July
2013, pp. ACB B526-B572

B532   Management  at  Safi  detention  centre  attempted  to  mislead   the
      delegation and hide a significant number of complaints which had  been
      lodged.

B545  Ta'Kandja had been closed since 2010. Immigration detainees were  thus
      held in either Safi Barracks (506 people, all men: 236 in Warehouse no
      1; 113 in Warehouse no 2; 124 in Block  B)  or  Lyster  Barracks  (248
      people including 89 women). The majority had arrived  in  spring  2011
      but some had been detained for over a year.

B546  There were complaints about staff  member's  racist  or  disrespectful
      behaviour.
      Detainees were called by their tag  numbers,  which  is  perceived  as
      humiliating and degrading. CPT again called for Malta to put an end to
      the practice.

B547   There  were  "hardly  any"   allegations   of   deliberate   physical
      mistreatment, but there were  frequent,  serious  allegations  of  the
      excessive use of force during recent disturbances.

B548  There appeared to be a problem of violence  among  detainees  in  both
      detention  centres.  "It  will  be  difficult  if  not  impossible  to
      effectively resolve this problem as long  as  more  than  240  foreign
      nationals are  being  held  under  cramped  conditions  and  in  total
      idleness in one single warehouse and that for prolonged periods."
      Material conditions in  Safi  Barracks'  two  warehouses  were  "still
      appalling"; "Extremely crowded"; Warehouse no. 1  only  had  7  mobile
      toilets and 7 mobile shower booths for 236 people,  in  "a  deplorable
      state."
      Conditions in Lyster Barracks  and  Block  B  had,  however,  improved
      significantly since 2008.


B549  "A significant number of detainees were lying in bed all day in  total
      apathy."  There was a "great"  likelihood  that  urgent  psychological
      needs went undetected for a long time.

International Commission of Jurists, 'Not Here to Stay', May 2012, based  on
a visit from 26-30 September 2011, ACB pp. B478-B525

B485  In  2011  1,574  people  arrived  in  Malta,  proving  2010  (with  47
      arrivals) to have been an  aberration  caused  by  the  Italian-Libyan
      'push-back'  initiative.  Nevertheless,  Maltese  reception   policies
      continue to be premised on  the  idea  that  migration  flows  are  an
      exceptional, temporary crisis.

B491  Maltese law excludes the vast majority of undocumented  migrants  from
      the protection of the EU Returns Directive, and thus  rights  such  as
      the right to be informed  of  the  reasons  for  their  removal  in  a
      language they understand and the right to  legal  aid.  ICJ  considers
      that the provision  of  legal  aid  at  appeals  stage  only  breaches
      international human rights law.

Detention conditions
B497   ICJ  visited  the  couples'  accommodation  at  Lyster  Barracks  and
      Warehouse no 1 and B Block at Safi Barracks.

B501  ICJ considers the immigration  detention  policy  to  be  incompatible
      with Malta's obligations under international human rights law.

B507  "In Safi Barracks, the accumulation of poor conditions  of  detention,
      including sanitary conditions, together  with  apparent  existence  of
      cases  of  psychological  instability,  the  the   lack   of   leisure
      facilities, the overcrowded conditions and the mandatory length of  18
      months detention brought, at the time of the visit, the  situation  in
      the detention centre beyond the  threshold  of  degrading  treatment."
      Violation of Article 3 ECHR. This was caused by the lack  of  capacity
      to deal with the sudden rise in the number of arrivals.

Access to legal assistance
B510  Detainees complained that they did not have  access  to  effective  or
      appropriate legal aid. "Lawyers sometimes spoke only very  briefly  to
      detainees and did not, or did not have time to, advise them in  detail
      or gather sufficient information on their cases,"

Conditions in open centres
B517  Marsa  Open  Centre,  which  is  run  by  an  NGO  contracted  by  the
      government, showed signs of  overcrowding  and  "raised  issues"  with
      regard to the right to adequate housing. However,  good  progress  was
      being made.

      Hal Far hangar was reopened in 2011 and housed  single  men  in  metal
      containers who had fled from Libya.
B520  Conditions were "very unsanitary",  prone  to  floods,  infested  with
      rats,  toilets  were  "quite  dirty",  there  were  drug  and  alcohol
      problems, insufficient bedding, dirty floors,  insufficient  lighting,
      relatively exposed to the elements.  ICJ  considered  that  conditions
      were sufficiently poor to  establish  degrading  treatment  in  breach
      Article 3 ECHR.


Human Rights Watch, 'Boat Ride to Detention', July 2012, ACB pp. B432-B477

B447-8      In 2011 Malta had the highest rate of  asylum  applications  per
      population  in  the  industrialised  world.  Its  asylum  system   was
      efficient - it had low backlogs - but only 4% of  applicants  in  2011
      were granted refugee status. 37% were granted  subsidiary  protection.
      17% were given "temporary humanitarian protection" at  the  discretion
      of the Refugee Commissioner.
B451  Malta's automatic detention policy of all irregular migrants  "amounts
      to arbitrary detention prohibited by international law".
B457  Prolonged  detention  impacts  negatively  on  migrants'  and  asylum-
      seekers' mental health.

Amnesty International, World Report 2013, ACB pp. B424-B425

B424  Arrivals by sea increased by 28% [in 2012] from 1,577 to 2,023.
      Malta continues to automatically detain asylum-seekers  in  breach  of
      international law.
       Appeal  procedures  to  challenge  asylum  decisions  "did  not  meet
      international human rights standards."
      Conditions in detention centres "remained poor  and  were  exacerbated
      by  overcrowding,  with  hundreds  experiencing   lack   of   privacy,
      insufficient access to
B425  sanitary and washing  facilities,  and  poor  recreation  and  leisure
      facilities. There were consistent  and  credible  reports  that  being
      detained in such conditions was adversely affecting the mental  health
      of migrants. Conditions in open centres ... remained inadequate."

B388  Overview of the asylum procedure.
Appeals
B392   Asylum  seekers  can  face  obstacles  in  appealing  a  decision  in
      practice.
      There are "no clear and established procedures in place  to  lodge  an
      appeal", but the RAB "does not accept late  appeals".  Forms  are  not
      always available in detention.
      The decision containing reasons for rejection is in English only.
      Only in "very limited and discretionary circumstances"  will  the  RAB
      hear evidence. Evidence that was not before RefCom would also only  be
      admitted if it had been previously unavailable or unknown.
      Hearings are in private.
      There is no onward appeal.
      Judicial review of the RAB have been lodged in years past  [cites  the
      same 3 cases cited by Dr Zammit] but these are not merits appeals  and
      are not automatically suspensive.

Interviews
B393  Personal  interviews  are  conducted  in  practice.  Interpreters  are
      required in national law  but  interpreters  are  not  always  readily
      available   unless    for    Somalis/Eritreans.    Complaints    about
      interpretation are sometimes raised on appeal.
      Applicants are not always provided with interview notes
      No opportunity to correct interview notes
      The quality of the notes "may not be fully ascertained."

Legal assistance
B394  Legal aid is not available until appeal stage.
      Free legal assistance is only provided by "a  limited  number  of  NGO
      lawyers". The limited number  of  lawyers  is  the  main  obstacle  to
      obtaining  such  assistance.  Private  lawyers  are  inaccessible   in
      practice in detention.
B395  Lawyers ability to effectively assist applicants is  impinged  by  not
      having access to the file -  having  to  manually  copy  documents  at
      RefCom's  office,  which  discourages  lawyers  from   assisting,   or
      assisting effectively.
      The appeal is by way of written submissions, and "the assistance of  a
      lawyer is essential for an effective appeal."
      Remuneration is inadequate for the work required.
      Detained  appellants  are  particularly  hard  to  assist  because  of
      obstacles to lawyers visiting detention centres and the  lack  of  any
      suitable place in detention centres where they can consult with  their
      client.

Provision of information
B403  An information leaflet from the police is in English only
B404  Information sessions run by RefCom are conducted only once  per  group
      of arrivals, prior to asylum-seekers registering any desire  to  claim
      asylum.
      There is a lack of constant flow of information from  the  authorities
      throughout the various stages of the procedure, no information desk or
      similar.
      Applicants can only obtain further information from NGOs
      No 'major obstacles' to accessing UNHCR or NGOs.
B413  Information provided is not adequate to meet the requirements  of  the
      Reception Regulations.

B317  In summer 2013 there were several incidents of attempted  'push-backs'
      to Libya. On 9th July the ECtHR issued a Rule 39 injunction, which was
      respected.
B318  Nevertheless, from 4-6 August 2013 the Maltese authorities refused  to
      let a rescue ship disembark and proposed the migrants be  returned  to
      Libya.
B320  The Maltese attempts to refoul  asylum-seekers  to  Libya  followed  a
      judgment of 28 June 2013 of the Constitutional Court  that  Malta  had
      refouled two Somalis to Libya in 2004.

JRS Europe, 'Protection Interrupted' 4 June 2013, ACB pp. B286-B305

B291  Migrants who leave Malta  irregularly  are  detained  and  charged  on
      return with a criminal offence, maximum penalty 2 years imprisonment.

B292  Their asylum claims will be treated  as  implicitly  withdrawn  (after
      2008)  if  they  were  not  contactable  while  abroad.  He  will   be
      susceptible to return.

      Returnees are not systematically  informed  of  the  status  of  their
      application for asylum. They will only obtain information if they seek
      legal assistance.

B293-4      Sets out the different material  provision  for  asylum-seekers,
      recipients  of  subsidiary  protection,  rejected  asylum-seekers  and
      refugees.

B295  Dublin returnees need to approach AWAS to request accommodation in  an
      open centre, which will only be given if there is  capacity.  Priority
      is given to other asylum seekers.

B275  Despite some improvements in conditions, UNHCR considers  the  current
      Maltese reception system, based on systematic administrative detention
      of  asylum-seekers,  is  not  in  conformity  with  international  law
      standards.

European Commission against Racism and Intolerance ('ECRI'),  report  of  15
October 2013, up to date to 6 December 2012

Asylum determination procedure
B194  Authorities report difficulties finding and keeping interpreters.
       Videoconferencing  to  the  UK  has   now   been   introduced   where
      interpreters are unavailable.
      ECRI stresses the importance of legal assistance at  the  'preliminary
      questionnaire' stage. Since almost all  boat  arrivals  are  indigent,
      only legal aid can secure their right to access legal  assistance.  It
      is "imperative" that asylum seekers receive advice on what is relevant
      to his/her application at first instance,  particularly  in  light  of
      reports that appeal success rates are "close to nil."
      Authorities claim applicants are provided with  a  copy  of  interview
      notes, a copy of their asylum application form,  and  a  copy  of  the
      asylum decision as soon as the case is closed. However, ECRI  received
      information that detained applicants have difficulty  accessing  their
      case files.
      ECRI is 'not convinced' that RAB is a 'judicial body' in view  of  the
      appointment of its members by the Prime Minister.
B195  Applicants have been refused an oral hearing by the RAB.

Reception Conditions
B195  Marsa Open Centre had improved since ECRI's last report.
      Hal Far  family  centre  had  been  improved,  and  tents  were  being
      replaced  with  containers.  Tents   that   remained   were   "clearly
      inadequate" and offered inadequate protection from inclement weather.
B196  ECRI was informed that Hal Far hangar complex now only houses men  and
      that the sanitary  facilities  had  been  refurbished.  ECRI  remained
      concerned that the facilities were not suitable for long-term stay.

           3.


           (1) This paragraph applies for the purposes of the determination
           by any person, tribunal or court whether a person who  has  made
           an asylum claim or a human rights claim may be removed-


             (a) from the United Kingdom, and
             (b) to a State of which he is not a national or citizen.


           (2) A State to which this Part applies shall be treated,  in  so
           far as relevant to the question mentioned in sub-paragraph  (1),
           as a place-


             (a) where a person's life and liberty are  not  threatened  by
             reason of his race, religion,  nationality,  membership  of  a
             particular social group or political opinion,
             (b) from which a person will not be sent to another  State  in
             contravention of his Convention rights, and
             (c) from which a person will not  be  sent  to  another  State
             otherwise than in accordance with the Refugee Convention.


           4.


           Section 77 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002
           (c.41) (no removal while claim for  asylum  pending)  shall  not
           prevent a person who has made a  claim  for  asylum  from  being
           removed-


             (a) from the United Kingdom, and
             (b) to a State to which this Part applies;


           provided that the Secretary  of  State  certifies  that  in  his
           opinion the person is not a national or citizen of the State.


           5.


           (1)  This  paragraph  applies  where  the  Secretary  of   State
           certifies that-


             (a) it is proposed to remove a person to a State to which this
             Part applies, and
             (b) in the Secretary of State's opinion the person  is  not  a
             national or citizen of the State.


           (3) The person may not bring an immigration appeal  from  within
           the United Kingdom
            in reliance on-


             (a) an asylum claim which asserts that to remove the person to
             a specified State to which this Part applies would breach  the
             United Kingdom's obligations under the Refugee Convention, or
             (b) a human rights claim in so  far  as  it  asserts  that  to
             remove the person to a specified  State  to  which  this  Part
             applies would be unlawful under section 6 of the Human  Rights
             Act 1998 because of the possibility of removal from that State
             to another State.


           (4) The person may not bring an immigration appeal  from  within
           the United Kingdom in reliance on a human rights claim to  which
           this sub-paragraph applies if the Secretary of  State  certifies
           that the claim is clearly unfounded; and the Secretary of  State
           shall certify a human rights claim to which  this  sub-paragraph
           applies  unless  satisfied  that  the  claim  is   not   clearly
           unfounded.


           (5) Sub-paragraph (4) applies to a human rights claim if, or  in
           so far as, it asserts a matter other than that specified in sub-
           paragraph (3)(b).






           6.


           A person who is outside the United  Kingdom  may  not  bring  an
           immigration appeal on  any  ground  that  is  inconsistent  with
           treating a State to which this Part applies as a place-


             (a) where a person's life and liberty are  not  threatened  by
             reason of his race, religion,  nationality,  membership  of  a
             particular social group or political opinion,
             (b) from which a person will not be sent to another  State  in
             contravention of his Convention rights, and
             (c) from which a person will not  be  sent  to  another  State
             otherwise than in accordance with the Refugee Convention.
