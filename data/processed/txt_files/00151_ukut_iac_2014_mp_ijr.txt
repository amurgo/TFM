                                  JUDGMENT

                          - - - - - - - - - - - - -

JUDGE warr: The applicant is a citizen of Turkey born on 20  February  1957.
    Permission to bring judicial review  proceedings  was  granted  by  the
    Upper Tribunal on 14 January 2014 to challenge a decision to deport the
    applicant dated 29 October 2013.   The  application  also  requested  a
    declaration that the respondent consider an application  made  in  2004
    and that the respondent might no longer lawfully exercise her power  to
    deport the applicant by reference to a conviction in September 2000.

2.   There has been a long and unfortunate  history  to  this  matter.   The
    applicant arrived in this country, aged 14, in or about  1972  and  was
    granted indefinite leave to remain on 1 April 1976, aged 19.

3.   On 20 January 1984 the applicant married a  Turkish  national  who  was
    granted British citizenship on 12 October 2001.  The couple have  three
    children born in 1985, 1987 and 1994 respectively.

4.   In February 1995 the applicant was charged with possession of  class  A
    drugs and a firearm.  It is common ground that the applicant  absconded
    in March 1995 and went to Turkey where he remained until May 2000.   On
    his return he was arrested and  convicted  on  26  September  2000  and
    sentenced to three years' imprisonment.  He was in custody for  fifteen
    months and discharged on 19 September 2001.  There are unfortunately no
    records kept by the Probation Service due to the length of  time  since
    these proceedings.

5.   The applicant had been granted leave to enter in 2000 apparently  on  a
    one year spouse visa but it does not appear to be in  dispute  that  by
    the time the applicant applied for leave to remain as a  spouse  on  26
    February 2004 his leave had lapsed.  Apart from a drink driving fine of
    ï¿½100 in March 2004 the applicant has not  been  in  trouble  since  his
    conviction.

6.   It is common ground that there has been an extremely regrettable  delay
    in dealing with the applicant's application.   It  is  clear  that  the
    applicant  was  making  repeated  representations  about  his  position
    including representations to the Prime Minister.

7.   On 11 February 2013 the respondent notified the applicant that  it  was
    proposed to deport him following his conviction in 2000.  Two decisions
    to deport the appellant had been taken, the first on 21  May  2013  and
    the second on 29 October 2013.  There  had  been  various  attempts  to
    express the reasoning for the Secretary of  State's  decisions  in  the
    accompanying letters of  refusal.  Following  the  first  decision  the
    applicant's  appeal  came  before  Judge  Lobo  on  28  June  2013  who
    apparently expressed concern at the  legality  of  the  decision  under
    challenge.  On 3 July 2013 a revised decision letter was issued by  the
    respondent.  The applicant's  appeal  subsequently  came  before  Judge
    Omotosho and a non-legal member on 23 October 2013.  On  that  day  the
    judge records that  the  Presenting  Officer  sought  to  withdraw  the
    decision  to  deport  and  apologised  for  the  delay  in  making  the
    application.  He explained that efforts had  been  made  prior  to  the
    hearing date to clarify the  matters  and  withdraw  the  decision  and
    acknowledged that the decision made appeared to be  not  in  accordance
    with the law but unfortunately the case-worker who had  initially  made
    the  decision  was  no  longer  working  for  the   Criminal   Casework
    Directorate (CCD).  The judge records the Presenting Officer as  saying
    that "as the CCD was the only department entitled to make a decision as
    to withdrawal, he had to wait to get authority to withdraw and this was
    only made recently".

8.   Judge  Omotosho  records  Mr  Fripp  (who  was  then  representing  the
    applicant, as he does before  us)  stating  that  while  the  delay  in
    informing the applicant of the respondent's  decision  was  regrettable
    "nevertheless there was no objection to this."  He requested the judge,
    however,  to  make   observations   about   the   applicant's   special
    circumstances.  The respondent's decision was not  in  accordance  with
    the law and it was also unfair to make a decision to deport bearing the
    applicant's lengthy residence in the United Kingdom, his community ties
    and the  length  of  time  that  had  elapsed  since  the  offence  and
    conviction.  He referred to the applicant's family life in  the  United
    Kingdom with his wife and children, his medical condition and the  lack
    of any further offending over the previous nine years.

9.   The First-tier Tribunal acceded to the  request  to  make  observations
    noting, among  other  things,  that  the  respondent  had  treated  the
    applicant's case as one to which the UK Borders Act 2007 applied,  when
    it did not.  The judge said in terms that had  the  decision  not  been
    withdrawn the Tribunal would have found in favour of the applicant both
    in relation to the lawfulness of the decision  to  deport  and  on  the
    issue of proportionality.

10.  Following these observations came the  decision  of  29  October  2013,
    accompanied by a further revised decision letter. In  relation  to  the
    2007 Act it is fair to say that a reference to that Act does appear  in
    the earlier refusal letters at paragraph 20 but the reference has  been
    removed in the corresponding paragraph of  the  letter  of  29  October
    2013.  The applicant lodged an appeal against the 29th October decision
    as well as instituting the judicial review  proceedings  herein  on  12
    November 2013.

11.  The First-tier Tribunal has listed  the  applicant's  hearing  of  that
    appeal on 6 May 2014.

12.  It is the  position  of  the  respondent  that  the  applicant  has  an
    alternative remedy and submits that the appeal  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal does constitute a convenient and effective  means  of  redress
    and reference is made to Kay v Lambeth London Borough Council [2006]  2
    AC 465 at paragraph 30 per Lord Bingham of Cornhill:
      "30. The respondents submitted that  if,  on  article  8  grounds,  an
      occupier wishes to resist a claim for possession valid under  domestic
      property law, the proper medium for such a challenge is an application
      for judicial review and the proper venue the Administrative Court  and
      not the county court. That is the proper forum in which a challenge to
      an exercise of public power by a public authority should be  resolved.
      If this were a correct submission it would have to be accepted, but it
      would have very unfortunate procedural consequences. It would lead  to
      the adjournment of the county court proceedings while application  was
      made for permission to apply for judicial review. Even  if  permission
      were refused, as would almost always  be  the  case,  there  would  be
      additional expense and  delay,  preventing  summary  disposal  of  the
      matter in the county court. The occupier  would  be  restricted  to  a
      procedure not well-adapted or routinely used  for  the  resolution  of
      sensitive factual questions and to a court traditionally  and  rightly
      reluctant to explore the merits of an apparently lawful  decision,  as
      it proved to be in Connors' case. But  in  my  opinion  it  is  not  a
      correct submission. Effect must be given to  section  7(1)(b)  of  the
      1998 Act, which provides:
           "(1)  a person who claims that a public authority has acted (or
           proposes to act) in a way which is made unlawful by section 6(1)
           [i.e. in a way which is incompatible with  a  Convention  right]
           may ...
           (b)  rely on the Convention right or rights  concerned  in  any
           legal proceedings, but only if he is (or would be) a  victim  of
           the unlawful act."
      This is express authority entitling the occupier to raise his  article
      8 challenge to the  possession  order  sought  against  him  in  those
      proceedings. It is consistent  with  authorities  such  as  Wandsworth
      London Borough Council v Winder [1985] AC 461 and Boddington v British
      Transport Police [1999] 2 AC 143, and respects the principle  that  if
      other means of redress are conveniently and effectively available to a
      party they ought ordinarily to  be  used  before  resort  to  judicial
      review: see, for example, R v Huntingdon District Council, Ex p  Cowan
      [1984] 1 WLR 501, 507. Where a party  seeks  relief,  on  conventional
      judicial review grounds,  which  only  the  Administrative  Court  can
      grant, there will, of course, be no alternative to an application  for
      judicial review, but that will very rarely, if ever, be the case where
      an occupier seeks to resist a possession order in reliance on  article
      8."
13.  Mr Fripp argued that permission had  been  granted  and  issues  as  to
    alternative remedies were to be considered at the threshold stage.

14.  Having considered the matter we decided that we would hear argument  on
    the alternative remedy point first as a preliminary matter.   Mr  Fripp
    relied on the reply that he had served  to  the  respondent's  detailed
    grounds of defence.  He pointed out, by reference to  R  (Shoesmith)  v
    Ofsted [2011] EWCA Civ 642 that the existence of a statutory appeal did
    not oust the jurisdiction of the court and the  relevant  question  was
    whether the alternative remedy was equally effective and convenient.

15.  He pointed to the very significant delay  and  hardship  occasioned  to
    the applicant by virtue of the respondent's conduct.  The applicant was
    unable to travel outside the United  Kingdom  for  fear  of  not  being
    permitted to return and had made persistent enquiries  over  the  years
    about his application.  He had been significantly prejudiced by  delay.
    He had suffered stress.  He had had a stroke.

16.  Mr Fripp referred to the respondent's track  record  in  the  case  and
    submitted that the statutory appeal system had already been shown to be
    susceptible  to  manipulation  and  delay  by  the  respondent  through
    withdrawal of previous decisions.  A decision had been withdrawn on the
    morning of the hearing on  23  October  to  be  replaced  in  virtually
    identical terms on 29  October.   There  was  a  potential  for  almost
    indefinite delay.  The same might happen in the future.

17.  The applicant could not visit his elderly  relatives  in  Turkey.   The
    applicant would not have  the  benefit  of  legal  aid  in  the  appeal
    proceedings. There was the issue of the application being made in  2004
    and the delay in reaching a decision in that matter.

18.  Issue was taken with the overall conduct of the respondent in the  case
    and the lawfulness of deciding to deport the  applicant  after  such  a
    lengthy delay.  These wider issues were more suitable to be dealt  with
    by judicial review.

19.  Previously it might have been said that the  appeal  proceedings  would
    provide a hearing before an expert Tribunal but as the matter had  come
    before the Upper Tribunal by way of judicial review that point  was  no
    longer a good one.

20.  Mr Roe submitted that the existence of  an  alternative  remedy  was  a
    relevant matter, notwithstanding that permission had been granted.   He
    referred to R v Falmouth and Truro Port Health Authority ex parte South
    West Water Limited [2001] QB 445. If  the  applicant  had  a  statutory
    right of appeal permission should only exceptionally be given - see  at
    page 473 per Simon Brown LJ.

21.  Mr Roe submitted that the First-tier Tribunal would have the powers  to
    deal with all aspects of the  case  including  the  lawfulness  of  the
    decision and the other matters relied upon.

22.  Mr Fripp had argued that an authoritative ruling was  required  but  it
    was submitted that the case turned on its own facts.  Mr Fripp had also
    pointed out that the applicant would not have the benefit of legal  aid
    before the First-tier Tribunal but it was a matter for  Parliament  how
    public resources were deployed.  The point relating to delay was  noted
    but the Tribunal hearing was not in the distant future.  In respect  of
    the point based on expertise it would depend on which High Court  Judge
    one was appearing in front of  -  some  judges  might  have  very  deep
    knowledge of the jurisdiction.

23.  In relation to the concern  that  the  respondent  might  withdraw  the
    decision at the last moment it had not been suggested hitherto that the
    respondent's approach had been based on cynicism and was  an  abuse  of
    process.  An explanation had  been  given  for  the  late  decision  to
    withdraw.  The decision-making process might  not  be  a  model  but  a
    letter had been recently issued on 17 February 2014  supplementing  the
    earlier letters.  In the letter of 17 February it was acknowledged that
    the matter of deportation was finely balanced.

24.  The  balance  of  convenience  rested  firmly  with  the  matter  being
    determined by the First-tier Tribunal who could hear oral evidence  and
    resolve all matters and make a decision with directions if appropriate.
     The applicant had an alternative remedy.   The  legal  effect  of  the
    matters  being  canvassed  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  would  be
    indistinguishable from the matters as determined on judicial review.

25.  Having had the benefit of the submissions of the  parties  we  informed
    them that we would be dismissing the  application  on  the  alternative
    remedy point and that reasons would follow. We now give these reasons.

26.  Firstly we are satisfied that it is appropriate for us to consider  the
    question  of  the  alternative  remedy  notwithstanding  the  grant  of
    permission.  Upper Tribunal Judge Gill when granting permission on  the
    papers made it plain that she was only considering the  arguability  of
    the issue  that  the  appeal  hearing  might  not  afford  an  adequate
    alternative remedy and she further observed that she only  had  a  very
    brief Acknowledgment of Service.

27.  We accept Mr Fripp's point, by reference to  R  (Shoesmith)  v  Ofsted,
    that  the  existence  of  an  alternative  remedy  does  not  oust  the
    jurisdiction of the court. We note the reasons given at  paragraphs  97
    to 99 per Kay, L.J. including the observation in paragraph 99 that  "in
    the unusual circumstances of this case there was much to  be  said  for
    keeping the claims against the three public authorities within one  set
    of proceedings, which could only be the judicial review proceedings."

28.  However, we find the factors in the present case point  very  much  the
    other way. It appears to us that it would be quite wrong to ignore  the
    fact that an appeal hearing is in fact imminent.  Apart from  the  fact
    that Parliament has conferred a right of appeal on  an  appellant  that
    would  ordinarily  provide  the  appropriate  remedy,  there  is  every
    indication that it would in  fact  be  a  more  effective  remedy  than
    judicial review.  For example, on judicial review, it is rare  to  hear
    oral evidence whereas it is routine to hear oral  evidence  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal.  The appellant and his family can give evidence if
    so advised.  The Tribunal can make findings of fact.  Most importantly,
    if it allows the appeal, it can make directions under section 87 of the
    2002 Act to give effect to  its  decision.  Such  directions  bind  the
    respondent.

29.  It is quite clear that the First-tier Tribunal has power to  deal  with
    errors of law and indeed the First-tier Tribunal made it plain what the
    Tribunal would have done had the appeal proceedings not been  withdrawn
    by operation of rule 17(2)  of  the  Asylum  and  Immigration  Tribunal
    (Procedure) Rules 2005 on notification that  the  deportation  decision
    had been withdrawn.  Despite Mr Fripp's valiant attempts we are  unable
    to see how the applicant's position could possibly be improved  by  any
    remedy the High Court could  issue  and  indeed  bearing  in  mind  the
    history there is every indication that  were  we  to  make  the  orders
    requested, far from being  an  effective  and  convenient  remedy,  the
    result would be further delay. Mr Fripp acknowledged that, even if  the
    applicant were to get the deportation decision quashed, together with a
    declaration that precluded the respondent from deporting the  applicant
    on the basis of the facts as they currently stood, he would still  have
    to await the respondent's further decision. This falls to be contrasted
    with the First-tier Tribunal's ability to make a direction  that  leave
    be granted if it finds the deportation decision falls to be differently
    decided and/or that Article 8 prevents the applicant's deportation.

30.  We should make it clear that we  are  far  from  unsympathetic  to  the
    applicant and his predicament bearing in mind the  lengthy  history  of
    this case.  However we find that in fact not only is the  Tribunal  the
    appropriate forum  but  it  is  in  fact  the  better  forum  from  the
    applicant's perspective. We do not consider  the  fact  that  decisions
    have been withdrawn at the last minute in the past raises  the  spectre
    that the same will happen in May.  The respondent has issued a  further
    explanatory letter and we are not prepared to draw the inference -  and
    indeed Mr Fripp does not invite us to draw the  inference  -  that  the
    respondent's conduct in this matter evidences a cynical manipulation of
    the system.

31.  Nothing can be guaranteed; but we see no reason  to  suppose  that  the
    hearing in May should not go ahead  as  planned.  That  hearing  should
    conveniently and effectively resolve the applicant's case.  Accordingly
    the applicant  has  an  alternative  remedy  and  this  application  is
    refused.  ~~~~0~~~~
