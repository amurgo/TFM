Anonymity
Rule 14: The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008
No anonymity order was made by the  First-tier  Tribunal.  I  find  that  no
particular issues arise on the facts of this case  that  give  rise  to  the
need for a direction. For this reason no anonymity direction is made.



                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background

    1. The First Appellant is a citizen of India.  She appeals against  the
       Respondent's decision dated 7 July 2014 to refuse to vary her  leave
       as a Tier 4 student on the basis that  if  leave  were  granted  she
       would have spent more than five years studying at  degree  level  or
       above and therefore that she could not satisfy  paragraph  245ZX(ha)
       of the Immigration Rules ("the Rules").  The Second Appellant is the
       First Appellant's dependent spouse.


    2. The Appellants' appeal was dismissed by  First-Tier  Tribunal  Judge
       Mayall in a decision promulgated on 7 January 2015 ("the Decision").
        The Judge found that paragraph 245ZX(ha) related to the  period  of
       leave rather than the period of actual study in accordance with  the
       case of Islam (Para 245ZX(ha): five years' study)  [2013]  UKUT  608
       (IAC) ("Islam") and on that basis, the  First  Appellant  could  not
       meet the rule.


    3. Permission was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge  Perkins  on  2  June
       2015 on the basis that it  was  arguable  that  the  Judge  had  not
       properly applied Islam.  Permission was not granted  to  argue  that
       Islam was wrongly  decided.   The  matter  comes  before  the  Upper
       Tribunal to  determine  whether  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Decision
       involved the making of an error of law.


    4. The First Appellant has been granted three periods  of  leave  as  a
       Tier 4 student.  She was refused leave on her fourth application  on
       the basis that she could not meet paragraph 245ZX(ha) of  the  Rules
       as the grant of the fourth period of leave would take her beyond the
       five years permitted by that rule.


       Submissions


    5. Mr Patel confirmed that the issue between the parties  concerns  two
       periods of leave. There is no dispute between the parties  that  the
       first period of leave was for study below degree level and therefore
       did not count towards the period of five years for the  purposes  of
       paragraph 245ZX(ha).  There is also no dispute that the period to be
       counted towards the five years in  relation  to  the  fourth  period
       which is the  subject  of  the  refusal  decision  under  appeal  is
       nineteen months.  The issues therefore  arise  in  relation  to  the
       second and third period of study.


    6. The First Appellant began her second period of study on 17 May  2010
       with leave to study until April 2013.  She stopped studying  as  she
       was pregnant and gave birth to her daughter on 12 March  2011.   She
       was reported to the Home Office by her college sponsor on  21  March
       2011 and prevented by that sponsor from resuming her studies with it
       after the birth.  The Home Office took no action on the report  that
       she had ceased studying  until  1  June  2012  when  her  leave  was
       curtailed to end on 31 July 2012.  The issue  in  relation  to  this
       period is therefore whether the period should end on 21  March  2011
       when her college reported that she had ceased to study,  on  1  June
       2012 when the Home Office had issued the curtailment letter or  when
       leave was curtailed on 31 July 2012.  The periods which would  count
       towards the five years would be eleven months, twenty-five months or
       twenty-seven months respectively.


    7. The First Appellant then applied to study at West City  College  Ltd
       and was issued a CAS for a course with a start  date  of  27  August
       2012 and an expected end date of 15 February 2014.  This sponsor was
       A rated Mr Patel submitted, the First Appellant  was  not  therefore
       permitted to study until she was granted  leave.   She  was  granted
       leave on 28 February 2013 to 15 June 2014. Mr Patel  submitted  that
       the period from 27 August 2012 to 28 February 2013  should  be  left
       out of account because the First Appellant could not have studied in
       that period as she did not have leave.  He also submitted  that  the
       period from 28 February 2014 to 15 June 2014 should be left  out  of
       account as the Home Office's Tier 4  guidance  indicated  that  such
       periods should be disregarded.  In support of  this  submission,  Mr
       Patel pointed to the guidance which indicates at paragraph 109  that
       periods granted before or after the main course of study as referred
       to in  the  table  set  out  earlier  in  the  guidance  are  to  be
       disregarded for the purposes of calculating the maximum  time  spent
       studying at degree level or above.   The  table  shows  that  for  a
       course of 12 months or more the length of stay allowed is the length
       of the course plus four  months.   Mr  Patel  also  pointed  to  the
       Statement of Changes to the Rules which came into force on 3  August
       2015.  Those obviously do not apply  in  this  case  but  show  that
       paragraph 245ZY(b)(iii) has been amended from that date to show that
       such periods are henceforth to be included and not disregarded.   If
       this third period is properly calculated from the grant of leave and
       not the start date of the course in the CAS, then the start date  is
       28 February 2013 and if the end date should exclude the period  from
       28 February 2014 to 15 June 2014, Mr Patel submitted,  the  relevant
       period is in fact 12 months and not either 18  months  (from  August
       2012 to February 2014) or 15 months (February 2013 to June 2014).


    8. Mr Patel therefore  submitted  that  the  Judge  had  erred  in  the
       Decision in finding that  the  two  periods  in  dispute  should  be
       calculated from 7 May 2010 to 31 July 2012 as to the  first  and  27
       August 2012 to 15 June 2014 as to the second and on  that  basis  to
       find that, after the latest period was added,  the  First  Appellant
       would be spending more than five years studying at degree  level  or
       above.


    9. Mr Bramble accepted that,  in  relation  to  the  second  period  in
       dispute, this should be calculated from 28  February  2013  and  not
       August 2012  (as  the  Home  Office  database  notes  confirm).   He
       submitted that in accordance with the decision in Islam, the  period
       counting towards the five years is the period  of  leave  which  has
       been granted.  On that basis, the first period should be from 7  May
       2010 to 31 July 2012  and  the  second  period  should  be  from  28
       February 2013 to 15 June 2014.  At paragraph 11 of Islam, the  Upper
       Tribunal stated that "It is the period of  the  leave  and  not  the
       actual study which is the measure for calculating the  period  spent
       in the UK  imposed  by  para  245ZX(ha)."  Mr  Bramble  very  fairly
       accepted though that on a reading of paragraph 245ZX as was in force
       at the date of the Secretary of State's decision in  this  case  and
       the Tier 4 guidance, the period of four months from 28 February 2014
       to 15 June 2014 should be left out of account.


      Decision and reasons


   10. At the end of the hearing, after considering the grounds  of  appeal
       and oral arguments, I indicated that I found there to be an error of
       law in the Decision and accordingly,  I  set  that  aside.   I  also
       indicated  that  I  would  remake  the  Decision  by  allowing   the
       Appellants' appeal. I indicated that I would provide my full reasons
       in writing and I do so below.


   11. In relation to the first period in dispute, I do not  consider  that
       the Judge erred.  In accordance with  Islam,  the  period  of  leave
       granted is what counts and not the period  during  which  the  First
       Appellant was actually studying.  Whilst Mr  Patel  is  entitled  to
       complain on the First Appellant's behalf about the delay in the Home
       Office curtailing her leave once informed by the  sponsor  that  she
       was not studying, it is equally incumbent on the First Appellant  to
       keep the Home Office  informed.   She  may  have  thought  that  her
       sponsor would allow her to resume studies after  the  birth  of  her
       child but when it was clear that this was not the case,  she  should
       either have informed the  Home  Office  herself  that  she  was  not
       studying, have returned to her home country  to  apply  for  another
       course or chased the Home Office for a 60 day letter to allow her to
       resume studies.  She did none of those things and she therefore only
       has herself to blame if she is now prejudiced  by  the  counting  of
       that period as part of her period of studies  for  the  purposes  of
       paragraph 245ZX(ha). Accordingly,  the  period  to  be  included  in
       relation to the first period in dispute is twenty-seven months.


   12. However, I do find that the Judge erred in the  calculation  of  the
       second period in dispute.  The case of Islam considered a  different
       issue and was not concerned with the very clear  provisions  in  the
       Rules (prior to 3 August 2015) and the  guidance  that  the  periods
       granted before and after the course of study are to  be  disregarded
       for the purposes of paragraph 245ZX(ha).  Accordingly, the  relevant
       period is from 28 February 2013 (when leave was granted) to February
       2014 (when the course ended).


   13. In accordance with paragraphs 11 and 12 above,  the  periods  to  be
       counted towards the five years under paragraph 245ZX(ha) are twenty-
       seven months in relation to the first period and  twelve  months  in
       relation to the second.  Adding those two periods  to  the  nineteen
       months which it is agreed is the relevant period in relation to  the
       refusal which is the subject of this appeal gives a total of  fifty-
       eight months  which  is  less  than  the  five  years  permitted  by
       paragraph 245ZX(ha). I therefore allow the First Appellant's appeal.
        The Second Appellant is  the  First  Appellant's  dependent  and  I
       therefore also allow his appeal.




DECISION

The First-tier Tribunal Decision did involve the making of  an  error  on  a
point of law.

I set aside the Decision

I re-make the Decision in the appeal by allowing the appeals.
