Representation:
For the appellant:     Mr Peter Deller, a Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer
For the respondent:    Ms Sanoz Saifolahi, Counsel instructed by M & K
Solicitors

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1. The Secretary of State appeals with permission against  the  decision  of
   the First-tier Tribunal allowing the claimant's against the her  decision
   on 30 January 2020 to refuse him a derivative residence card pursuant  to
   regulations 16  and  20  of  the  Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)
   Regulations 2016.

2. The claimant is a citizen of Sri  Lanka.   His  claim  is  based  on  his
   responsibilities as the carer of his elderly father,  who  is  a  British
   citizen of Sri Lankan origin, born in 1949 and currently 71 years old.

3. It is accepted on the claimant's behalf that the First-tier Tribunal  and
   the Upper Tribunal are seised only of issues under the  EEA  Regulations.
   There has been no section 120 notice  and  Article  8  ECHR  is  not  the
   subject of the present appeal.

Background

4. The claimant has an unappealing immigration  history.   He  came  to  the
   United Kingdom in March 2003, aged 21, on a visit visa which  expired  in
   September 2003.  He has had no permission to be  in  the  United  Kingdom
   since then.

5. The claimant's account is that his father's health began  to  deteriorate
   about 12 years after his arrival.  The claimant helped his father, and on
   13 April 2017, London Borough of Brent registered  him  as  his  father's
   full-time unpaid carer.

6. The claimant took no steps to regularise his position until  21  November
   2018, when he applied for a derivative residence card, which was refused.
    He had an in-country right of appeal which he  exercised,  against  that
   decision.  The decision of First-tier Judge  Manuell  is  the  Devaseelan
   starting point for the next appeal.    The  claimant  was  appeal  rights
   exhausted in August 2019.

7. On 2 December 2019, the claimant made a second derivative residence  card
   application, with more information.  The respondent  refused  again,  and
   the claimant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.

First-tier Tribunal decision

8. By a decision sent to the parties on 21 December 2020,  First-tier  Judge
   Stedman allowed the claimant's appeal.   He did  so  after  conducting  a
   fact-specific exercise, for the following reasons:

    "26. Bringing all of these elements together and  undertaking  a  fact-
    specific exercise, I find that there can be very little room for  doubt
    that the [claimant's] father is provided with a very significant amount
    of physical and mental health [care] by the  [claimant]  and  that  the
    level of care which would be provided by social services is  unable  to
    provide a sufficient level of care, in physical  and  emotional  terms,
    and in terms of safety and the prevention of harm.  And by some margin.
     There is, in addition for the reasons  I  have  given,  a  significant
    level of emotional dependency that could not be replaced or substituted
    by outside social health resources.

    27.  In forming my conclusion on the balance of the  evidence,  I  have
    placed weight on the letter from the [claimant's] father's GP dated  22
    September 2020, and also the report of Mr Chapman, which I found to  be
    expressed in clear and cogent terms.  I have relied on the [claimant's]
    statements and evidence regarding the declining state of  his  father's
    mental health state and memory and I  have  considered  the  prevailing
    conditions as a result of Covid.  ...

    28.  In my judgment there is a real risk of  the  [claimant's]  father,
    who is clearly vulnerable, suffering a serious decline  of  his  mental
    and physical health without the presence of the [claimant].  I have  to
    look at the practical implications of the removal of the [claimant] and
    what that would mean in real terms.  I find that if the [claimant]  was
    removed from the United Kingdom, that his father would be compelled  to
    leave  also  because  he  would  not  be  capale   of   residing   here
    independently or access the high level of input that he  requires.   It
    is my perspective that the conclusion of Judge Manuell that the  issues
    in this appeal merely concern a 'question of personal  preferences'  is
    not justified on the evidence."

9. The facts underlying that assessment are to be found at [17]-[25] of  the
   decision, and include confusion, significant cognitive decline,  eyesight
   and hearing problems, and a number of long-standing  conditions.   On  29
   May 2019, Brent Council made a disabled facilities grant for  adaptations
   to the father's home.

10.  A  letter  from  Dr  Zahira  Bachelani,  the  family  general   medical
   practitioner, was to the effect that the claimant was his  father's  full
   time carer and Brent  Social  Services  would  not  be  able  to  provide
   adequate care if he were  removed.   Mr  David  Chapman,  an  independent
   social worker, observed that the claimant's father was very confused  and
   unable to respond to him, and that his mental capacity was deteriorating,
   and that the input required from the claimant had  'increased  enormously
   recently due to the deteriorating health of his father'.  A  letter  from
   Talking Therapy in August 2018 referred to memory problems and  suggested
   a referral to memory services. The claimant has made contact with support
   services for people with dementia.

11. An email from Zaid Izhan, ASC Duty Social Worker at Brent Council,  sets
   out his assessment:

    "To summarise my assessment, [Mr] Hassanally  lives  in  a  two-bedroom
    ground   floor   private   rented   property   with   shared   kitchen,
    toilet/bathroom.  His son lives with him and provides care.

    He has glaucoma, hearing aids, numbness on calf,  weak  knee  and  back
    pain,  hypertension  [and]  diabetes.   He  was  confused   previously,
    resulting in wandering, however since a medication change he  has  been
    more stable.  [Mr] Hassanally  requires  support  with  all  his  daily
    living tasks, which [the claimant] is currently supporting with.

    [Mr]  Hassanally  requires  support  with  accessing   the   community,
    attending GP appointments, etc.  I have  informed  son  of  befriending
    services and  suggested  he  contact  the  hospital  department  or  GP
    regarding transport  to  appointments.   I  have  also  suggested  taxi
    vouchers and Dial-a-Ride.

    If [the claimant] was unable to provide the  relevant  support,  social
    services could support with commissioning carers two/three times a  day
    for 30 minutes each at around ï¿½15 an hour.  This  is  to  support  with
    personal care, dressing, prompt medication and meals.  [Mr]  Hassanally
    would be required  to  purchase  support  with  shopping,  laundry  and
    cleaning, using his benefits."

12. The First-tier Judge found the claimant to be  an  honest  and  credible
   witness as to his  father's  care  needs,  memory  issues  and  cognitive
   decline.  He allowed the appeal.

13. The Secretary of State appealed to the Upper Tribunal.





Permission to appeal

14. Permission to appeal was granted  by  First-tier  Judge  Martin  on  the
   basis that the First-tier Judge had arguably erred  in  focusing  on  the
   level of care given by the claimant to his father,  as  opposed  to  what
   Brent Social Services could provide, rather than whether the father would
   be compelled to leave the United Kingdom if his  son  were  removed;  and
   also, that the judge had failed to have regard to  the  decision  of  the
   Supreme Court in Patel v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department
   [2019] UKSC 59, in which the facts were considered to be very similar.

Rule 24 Reply

15. The claimant's Counsel settled a Rule 24 Reply, identifying four  issues
   in the Secretary of State's grounds of appeal:

   1) That the First-tier Judge had focused on whether  the  level  of  care
      given to the claimant's father would be inferior, rather than  whether
      his father would be compelled to  leave  the  United  Kingdom  if  the
      claimant were to leave indefinitely;

   2) That the First-tier Judge had failed to have regard to Patel,  and  to
      the high threshold it set;

   3) That the First-tier Judge failed to justify  his  departure  from  the
      decision of First-tier Judge Manuell, and failed properly to focus  on
      that decision as the Devaseelan starting point; and

   4) That the First-tier Judge failed to consider whether the facts of  the
      appeal were amenable to an application for leave to remain on  Article
      8 ECHR grounds, removing the compulsion on the claimant and his father
      to leave the United Kingdom.

16. That is the basis on which this appeal came before the Upper Tribunal.

Upper Tribunal hearing

17. The appeal was heard today by Skype for Business, on the basis  of  oral
   and written submissions.  The claimant and his father were present on the
   call.  Neither party objected to a remote hearing and I am satisfied that
   it was appropriate to hear the Secretary of State's appeal in  this  way.
   There were no technical difficulties.

18. Mr Deller adopted the concise  analysis  of  the  Secretary  of  State's
   grounds above and made focused  oral  submissions  which  were  of  great
   assistance to the  Upper  Tribunal.   He  accepted  that  there  was  new
   evidence which provided a  potential  justification  for  departing  from
   First-tier Judge Manuell's earlier decision, when much  less  information
   had been available.  He was not inclined to press  the  Devaseelan  point
   for that reason.

19. As regards Article 8  ECHR,  given  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  was
   expressly not seised of that issue, and there was no section 120  notice,
   Mr Deller accepted that failure to consider  Article  8  ECHR  could  not
   constitute an error of law or fact by the First-tier Judge.

20. That left the first two grounds, which can be considered together.   The
   First-tier Judge had not overlooked Patel: Mr Deller argued that a precis
   of the Patel test was to erase the claimant from  the  equation  and  see
   what would happen by way of Social Services care if he  were  not  there.
   The European Union Zambrano right was a last resort, requiring  something
   close to impossibility of the father remaining without his son, in  order
   for the claimant to succeed.

21. For the claimant, Ms Saifolahi relied on  the  opinion  of  Lady  Arden,
   with whom Lady Hale, Lord Carnwath, Lord Briggs and Lord Sales agreed, at
   [4]-[5] and [17]-[18] of Patel.  The facts were different in  Patel:  the
   father in that case required dialysis and there was no certainty that  he
   would be able to access it in India if he returned there with his father.
    The father in Patel also still had  a  living  spouse,  the  appellant's
   mother, and the Supreme Court found that he  would  be  provided  with  a
   social services care package and appropriate medical treatment if his son
   were to leave.  At [17]-[22],  Lady  Arden  explained  the  test  and  Ms
   Saifolahi contended that the claimant could properly  be  found  to  fall
   within the narrow test she outlined.

Analysis

22. This is a fact-specific  decision  and  the  First-tier  Judge  in  this
   appeal heard oral evidence from the claimant, which he found to be honest
   and credible, and also had a significant amount of new  written  evidence
   as to the deterioration in the claimant's  father's  health  since  Judge
   Manuell's decision in 2019.  The judge did  not  err  in  departing  from
   Judge Manuell's analysis for that reason: as already  stated,  Mr  Deller
   sensibly did not press the point.

23. The First-tier Judge gave himself a proper self-direction on  the  Patel
   test at [14], citing [22] in Lady Arden's opinion:

         "22.    What lies at the heart of the Zambrano jurisprudence is the
         requirement that the Union citizen  would  be  compelled  to  leave
         Union territory if the TCN, with  whom  the  Union  citizen  has  a
         relationship of dependency, is removed. As the CJEU  held  in  O  v
         Maahanmuuttovirasto (Joined Cases C-356/11 and C-357/11) [2013] Fam
         203, it is the role of the national court to determine whether  the
         removal of the TCN carer would actually cause the Union citizen  to
         leave the Union. In this case, the FTT found against Mr  Patel  and
         concluded that his father would not accompany him  to  India.  That
         means that, unless Chavez-Vilchez adopts a  different  approach  to
         compulsion, Mr Patel's appeal must fail. There is  no  question  of
         his being able to establish any interference  with  his  Convention
         right to respect for his private and family life as he  has  failed
         already in that regard."

24. I remind myself of the narrow circumstances in which it  is  appropriate
   to interfere with a finding of fact by a First-tier Judge who  has  heard
   the parties give oral evidence: see AA (Nigeria) v Secretary of State for
   the Home Department [2020]  EWCA  Civ  1296  and  R  (Iran)  &  Others  v
   Secretary of State for the Home Department [2005] EWCA Civ 982 at [90] in
   the judgment of Lord Justice Brooke, with whom Lord Justice Chadwick  and
   Lord Justice Maurice Kay agreed.

25. The question then is whether it can properly be  said  that  the  First-
   tier Judge focused on whether the level of care given to  the  claimant's
   father would be  inferior,  rather  than  whether  his  father  would  be
   compelled to leave the United Kingdom  if  the  claimant  were  to  leave
   indefinitely.  I am not satisfied that such is a proper  characterisation
   of this carefully reasoned decision.  The materials before the First-tier
   Judge were more than  sufficient  to  show  that  if  the  claimant  were
   removed, his father would be obliged to go with him.




26. The evidence from Brent Social Services was  to  the  effect  that  only
   very limited support could be provided if the claimant  were  not  there,
   and that the father, who lives on benefits, would have to  organise  most
   things from his very limited financial resources.  The father  has  sight
   and hearing difficulties, and  confusion.   He  has  a  number  of  other
   ailments and, probably, dementia.




27. Based on the facts found in  his  decision,  the  First-tier  Judge  was
   unarguably entitled to conclude that in practice, if  the  claimant  were
   removed, his father would have to accompany him.  On that basis,  it  was
   open to him to allow the appeal for the reasons he gave in his decision.

28. I therefore uphold the decision of the First-tier Judge and dismiss  the
   Secretary of State's appeal.

DECISION

29. For the foregoing reasons, my decision is as follows:


   The making of the previous decision involved the making of no error on  a
   point of law
   I do not set aside the decision but order that it shall stand.
