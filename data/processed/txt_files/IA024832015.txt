Representation:

For the Appellant:              Mr N. Bramble (21.01.16) and Mr S. Staunton
                           (01.03.16), Specialist Appeals Team
For the Respondent/Claimant:    Mr A. Bajwa (21.01.16) and Ms K. Joshi

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Secretary of State appeals to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Aujla) allowing the claimant's appeal
    against the decision of the Secretary of State to remove  her  and  her
    dependent children as persons subject to administrative  removal  under
    Section 10 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999,  their  asylum/human
    rights claim having been refused.   The  First-tier  Tribunal  made  an
    anonymity direction, and in the light of the case  which  the  claimant
    has advanced in the Upper  Tribunal,  I  consider  that  her  anonymity
    should be preserved.

The Reasons for Granting Permission

 2. On 12 November 2015 First-tier Tribunal Judge Simpson gave her  reasons
    for granting the Secretary of State permission to appeal.  In  essence,
    it was arguable that the judge, who was not assisted by the absence  of
    a HOPO, had not reached  an  adequately  reasoned  decision;  had  made
    errors of fact (English is one of the national languages  of  Nigeria);
    had failed  to  explain  what  the  insurmountable  obstacles  were  to
    reintegration; and had wrongly treated EX.1 as freestanding.

The Error of Law Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

 3. After hearing from Mr Bramble  and  Mr  Bajwa,  who  appeared  for  the
    claimant below, I found that an error of law was made out such that the
    decision should be set aside and remade.  I  gave  my  reasons  for  so
    finding in short form, and said that  I  would  give  extended  written
    reasons in due course

Reasons for Finding an Error of Law

 4. Mr Bramble agreed with Mr Bajwa that the judge had not erred in law  in
    considering whether the claimant was eligible for leave to remain under
    the child  route  in  Appendix  FM,  and  in  finding  that  she  could
    potentially take advantage of the exemption criteria contained in EX.1.
    For she is the sole carer of her two dependent children, and it is  not
    suggested there is another person in the United Kingdom  who  can  look
    after them in her place.

 5. The judge's error lies in him not conducting a  thorough  and  balanced
    best  interest  assessment  as  set  out  in  the   authorities,   most
    conveniently by Clarke LJ at paragraphs [35] to [37] of EV  Philippines
    [2014] EWCA Civ 874.

 6. The judge also did not  address  wider  proportionality  considerations
    before reaching the conclusion that it would be totally unreasonable to
    expect both the claimant's  daughters  to  leave  the  United  Kingdom,
    including the daughter who had not yet accrued seven years'  residence,
    but would do so within a month of the hearing (on 5 August 2015).   The
    judge did not acknowledge that the two children would be going back  to
    the country of their nationality as part of a family unit, that English
    was the national language of Nigeria, and that there was a  functioning
    healthcare and education system in Nigeria.

 7. The judge also did not take into account that none of  the  members  of
    the family were British citizens, and none of them had any status,  and
    so prima facie it was reasonable to expect the children to leave the UK
    with their sole carer, and  the  desirability  of  the  children  being
    educated at public expense in the UK could not outweigh the benefit  to
    the children of remaining with their sole parent.

 8. The judge rightly considered the question of the difficulties that  the
    family might face on return to  Nigeria.   However,  he  did  not  give
    adequate reasons for holding that there appeared to be no obvious means
    by which the appellant could provide for her two children as  a  single
    mother on her return to Nigeria, or for holding at paragraph [36] that,
    as a result of the claimant having lived  in  the  United  Kingdom  for
    sixteen years,  there  would  be  very  significant  obstacles  to  the
    claimant reintegrating into life in Nigeria with her children.

 9. On the issue of obstacles to reintegration, the  judge  was  confronted
    with a difficult procedural conundrum.  In 2012 the claimant had made a
    claim for asylum which had been  refused,  and  the  claimant  had  not
    apparently  appealed  against  the  refusal.   However,   her   witness
    statement for the hearing contained an account of past  persecution  in
    Nigeria which, if credible, was clearly relevant  to  the  question  of
    whether there were very significant obstacles to her reintegration into
    life in Nigeria and/or whether the safety and welfare of  the  children
    would be imperilled on return to Nigeria.

10. Having set out a summary of her oral evidence in  paragraph  [26],  the
    judge concluded by saying  that  the  claimant  did  not  rely  on  her
    comments about asylum and Article 3 that she set  out  in  her  witness
    statement.  This raised the following question: which passages  in  her
    witness statement was she abandoning,  and  why?  The  answer  to  this
    question was relevant to the assessment of her general credibility.

11. The above problem is compounded by the  judge's  finding  at  paragraph
    [30], where he said that  she  came  across  as  a  witness  of  truth,
    "although she may have slightly embellished her  account."   The  judge
    does not go on to identify the respects in which the claimant may  have
    embellished her account.

12. The upshot is that  the  judge  has  not  given  adequate  reasons  for
    allowing the claimant's appeal, and so the decision must be  set  aside
    and remade, with none of the findings of  fact  made  by  the  previous
    Tribunal being preserved.

The Resumed Hearing to Remake the Decision

13. For the purposes of the  resumed  hearing,  the  claimant's  solicitors
    prepared a supplementary bundle containing a second  witness  statement
    from the claimant.  I noted that the claimant continued to assert  that
    she had in effect a well-founded  fear  of  persecution  on  return  to
    Nigeria.  Ms Joshi insisted that the  claimant  was  not  advancing  an
    asylum claim, or a claim under Article 3 ECHR.  She  only  proposed  to
    rely  on  the  claimant's  evidence  to  establish  that  removal   was
    disproportionate.   Having   discussed   this    matter    with    both
    representatives, I ruled that I would not seek to fetter  the  claimant
    in the evidence which she gave, but that  in  assessing  its  probative
    value I would have to take  into  account  the  reasons  given  by  the
    Secretary of State for rejecting her asylum claim.  These  reasons  are
    contained in a letter dated 21 December 2012 which Mr Staunton  had  on
    file, and which I arranged to have copied.

14. The claimant gave oral evidence,  and  she  was  cross-examined  by  Mr
    Staunton.  She was re-examined by  Ms  Joshi,  and  she  also  answered
    questions for clarification purposes from me.

15. In his closing submissions on behalf of  the  Secretary  of  State,  Mr
    Staunton submitted that the children had been brought up  in  the  same
    "demographic" as they  would  be  returning  to  in  West  Africa.   So
    resettling in Nigeria would not be a culture shock to them.  It was not
    credible that the claimant  had  survived  in  the  UK  simply  through
    providing intermittent hairdressing services to friends.  So she  could
    work as a hairdresser in Nigeria in  order  to  earn  enough  money  to
    maintain  and  accommodate  herself  and  the  children.   She  had   a
    significant network of friends here  who  were  part  of  the  Nigerian
    diaspora, and she could reasonably expect to look to such  friends  for
    assistance and support in re-establishing herself on return to Nigeria.

16. On behalf of the claimant, Ms Joshi submitted there were compelling and
    exceptional  circumstances  outside  the  Rules  which  justified   the
    claimant and her children being accorded Article 8 relief.  The  eldest
    child had nearly acquired British citizenship as a result of ten years'
    residence.  Their mother had been here for  over  sixteen  years.   The
    children would find  it  difficult  to  adapt  to  a  different  school
    curriculum in Nigeria.  The claimant had given credible  evidence  that
    her second child was "hairy" like her, and so would be vulnerable, like
    her, to being accused of being a witch.  Due  to  the  claimant's  past
    adverse experiences in Nigeria, both as a child and as a  young  adult,
    and because of her genuine fears of persecution in Nigeria  on  return,
    there was a high likelihood that the claimant would not have  the  will
    to look after her children properly and to protect them from harm.

Discussion and Findings on Remaking

17. It was accepted by Ms Joshi that the claimant  could  not  qualify  for
    leave to remain under the parent route contained in Appendix  FM.  This
    was on the understanding that neither child had  accrued  seven  years'
    residence on the date of application. Child T  was  born  on  23  March
    2007. Child V was born on 5 August 2008. Having checked the file, I  am
    satisfied that the  application  which  triggered  the  decision  under
    appeal was made after Child T had turned  seven  years  of  age,  by  a
    letter dated 27 March 2014. Accordingly EX.1(a) and Rule  276ADE(1)(iv)
    are engaged. However, both children are also  qualifying  children  for
    the purposes of  Section  117B(6),  and  the  question  whether  it  is
    reasonable to expect the children to leave the  UK  needs  only  to  be
    answered once. So  I  will  answer  this  question  in  due  course  by
    reference to Section 117B(6).

18. Ms Joshi did  not  address  me  on  the  possibility  of  the  claimant
    qualifying for leave to remain  on  private  life  grounds  under  Rule
    276ADE(1)(vi) on the  ground  that  there  would  be  very  significant
    obstacles to her reintegrating into life in Nigeria with her children.

19. The claimant presented her asylum claim  in  2012.   She  was  given  a
    screening interview on 23 November 2012 and she attended a  substantive
    asylum interview on 18 December 2012.  In repudiating her claim in  the
    subsequent refusal letter of 21 December 2012, the Secretary  of  State
    took into account the Country of Origin Information Service Report  for
    Nigeria dated 6 January 2012.

20. The claimant's claim was that she did not have any  family  or  friends
    remaining in Nigeria.  She did not know her father, and her mother  had
    abandoned her when she was born.  She said her mother's relative,  Aunt
    P, had brought her up in Benin City.  She did not know  where  she  was
    now because she had lost contact with her.   She  had  left  school  at
    around the age of 12 and a few years later she had learnt hairdressing.
     In 1994 she had married a native doctor, "C", and had lived  with  him
    in Benin City.  Her problems began in Nigeria in  early  December  1999
    when C died.  Another native doctor said that the chief had been killed
    by witchcraft.  The claimant, who was the chief's seventh and  youngest
    wife, was accused by the other wives, children and family  of  being  a
    witch and of killing the chief by witchcraft.  This was because she had
    slept in the room with him the day he died.  She was locked in  a  room
    with the chief's body for over a  week.   Approximately  four  to  five
    times a day the chief's family came to  the  room  and  beat  her  with
    sticks, canes and brooms in an effort to get her to  confess  that  she
    had killed him with her witchcraft.  She claimed  that  she  had  scars
    from these beatings.  Eventually she had managed  to  escape  from  the
    house with the help of the chief's servant.

21. She went to the house of a friend of hers called E which was between 30
    and 45 minutes away on foot.  She took a bus with E to E's aunt's house
    in Port Harcourt, which was in another state.   E's  aunt  was  already
    aware she had been accused of killing the chief  with  witchcraft,  and
    scolded E for bringing her to her house.  She felt that E  was  putting
    her life at risk.  The aunt said that she had a friend  in  Lagos  that
    she would take her to.  She travelled to Lagos by bus with  E  and  her
    aunt.  They took her to Aunt A, who was a friend of E's aunt.   Aunt  A
    agreed to help her.  She said that the chief had been  a  very  popular
    native doctor, and it would only be a matter of time before people knew
    that she was staying in Lagos.  The claimant stayed with Aunt  A  while
    she arranged travel documents.  Aunt A said she would bring her to  the
    UK because she already had plans to travel there.  She travelled to the
    UK with Aunt A on 24 December 1989 using someone else's  passport  with
    her picture on it.

22. In the year 2000, shortly after she arrived in the UK,  she  said  that
    Aunt A had told her that she owed her �10,000, which she had  to  repay
    through engaging in prostitution.  Aunt A took her  to  live  with  her
    friend, Aunt M, in Dagenham where she worked as a prostitute.

23. Approximately two weeks later, Aunt A returned to Nigeria.  Eventually,
    in the summer of 2000 the claimant escaped from Aunt M.  She  said  she
    had not heard from either Aunt M or Aunt A since escaping from Aunt M's
    house in the year 2000.  She said she had never reported Aunt M or Aunt
    A to the police in the UK because she was worried that the police would
    send her back to Nigeria.  The father of  her  two  children  was  from
    Nigeria.  At the time of the asylum interview she had not seen him  for
    four and a half years.  The children did not have  contact  with  their
    father, and she did not know where he was.

24. On the one hand, she claimed not to have worked in the UK, but to  have
    relied on charity from friends, the church and the Red Cross.   On  the
    other hand, she said that she had worked in the UK as a childminder and
    by plaiting people's hair in return for food, clothes and money.   When
    she applied for ILR on 7 September 2010, she claimed she had worked  as
    a childminder.

25. In the refusal letter, the Secretary of State gave detailed reasons for
    rejecting the claimant's account of her past experiences, including her
    claim to have been coerced into prostitution in the  UK  and  of  being
    accused of witchcraft in Nigeria.  As to the latter, it was noted  that
    she did not claim to have heard  from  C's  family  since  her  alleged
    escape in December 1999.  She had provided no evidence that C's  family
    were still looking  for  her.   The  claimed  events  had  taken  place
    thirteen years ago, and she had not submitted any evidence  in  support
    of this part of her claim.  It was further noted  that  she  had  never
    approached the police in Nigeria.  But even if her claim was  taken  at
    its highest, and it was accepted C's family  wanted  to  kill  her  for
    being a witch, it was considered that  sufficiency  of  protection  and
    internal relocation were both viable options for her.

26. On the topic of internal relocation, it was put  to  her  in  interview
    that she could relocate to another city like Abuja or Lagos.   She  had
    claimed the oracle (a spirit) would tell her former husband's family as
    soon as she returned to Nigeria.  When asked if there  were  any  other
    reasons why she could not relocate to a big city like Abuja,  she  said
    no.

27. It was not accepted that C's family would be informed of her return  to
    Nigeria through the oracle, or that the oracle would notify them of her
    location.  It was not accepted therefore  she  could  not  relocate  to
    Abuja, Lagos or anywhere else in Nigeria,  particularly  when  she  had
    been able to relocate from Nigeria to the UK, a country  to  which  she
    had no cultural ties upon entry.

28. On the topic of assisted voluntary return, the Secretary of State  said
    that Refugee Action facilitated three  programmes  which  the  claimant
    could potentially utilise.  These were VARRP,  AVRIM  and  AVRFC.   The
    latter provided assistance for families and children to return to their
    country of origin.  For all programmes, Refugee  Action  could  arrange
    travel documentation, and provide assistance  at  the  airport  in  the
    United Kingdom, arrange a flight to the country of origin and help with
    onward transport to her final destination.  Under VARRP,  the  claimant
    might qualify for reintegration and support worth �1,500.  Under  AVRFC
    each family member might qualify for reintegration  and  support  worth
    �2,000, including a �500 relocation grant per person given in cash at a
    UK airport.

29. The claimant repeated her asylum claim in her oral evidence before  me,
    although with some variations and additions.  One of  the  reasons  she
    was accused of being responsible for killing C by witchcraft  was  that
    she was hairy and she had a beard. (No facial hear was visible to  me.)
    When she escaped, her friend took her to her sister, not her  aunt,  in
    Port Harcourt.  This sister in Port Harcourt sent her to a friend,  not
    a relative, in Lagos where she thought that the claimant would  not  be
    traceable, and therefore would be safe.  She could not say how long she
    had stayed in Lagos.  But it was a matter of months, not weeks.

30. The claimant was not credible in her account of  past  persecution  for
    the reasons given in the letter  refusing  her  asylum  application,  a
    decision against which the claimant has not  pursued  an  appeal.   The
    claimant's  account  does  not  gain  credibility  through  repetition,
    particularly as there are material respects in which the latest account
    diverges from the account given to the Home Office in 2012.

31. Mr Staunton elicited from the claimant in cross-examination  that  most
    of her hairdressing clients are members  of  the  congregation  of  the
    Catholic Church where she worships, and that many of them are part of a
    Nigerian diaspora, albeit that other members of the  congregation  hail
    from other parts of West Africa and also from Caribbean countries  such
    as Jamaica.

32. In addition, on her own account, the claimant was able to  access  help
    and support from the wider community in Nigeria in  order  to  "escape"
    from her deceased husband's family in Benin  City.   The  claimant  has
    displayed considerable  resourcefulness  in  establishing  a  life  for
    herself in the UK, despite entering the  country  illegally  and  never
    having permission to work here.

33. For the above reasons, I find  that  there  are  not  very  significant
    obstacles to the claimant's reintegration into life in Nigeria, despite
    her having been absent from the country  for  over  sixteen  years  and
    despite her having two dependent children to  look  after  as  well  as
    herself.  In addition to the support which she can access from  Refugee
    Action, as set out in the  asylum  refusal  letter,  the  claimant  can
    reasonably be  expected  to  access  support  from  a  support  network
    provided by the Catholic Church  in  Nigeria  and/or  from  friends  or
    relatives of members of  the  Nigerian  diaspora  here  with  whom  the
    claimant has developed a close association over the years as  a  result
    of worshipping at the  same  church  and  also  providing  hairdressing
    services in order to help support herself and the children.

34. Turning to an  Article  8  claim  outside  the  Rules,  I  accept  that
    questions 1 and 2  of  the  Razgar  test  should  be  answered  in  the
    claimant's favour.  Questions 3 and  4  of  the  Razgar  test  must  be
    answered in favour of the Secretary of State.  On the crucial  question
    of proportionality, the best interests of the children  are  a  primary
    consideration.  For the purposes of Section 117B(6) of  the  2002  Act,
    both children are qualifying children as both of them have accrued over
    seven years' residence in the United Kingdom.

35. In deciding whether it is reasonable for the children  to  relocate  to
    Nigeria with their mother, who has no right  to  remain,  I  take  into
    account the relevant jurisprudence.

36.  EV (Philippines) v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 874 provides  the  most  recent
    guidance from the senior courts on the approach to best  interests  and
    the question of reasonableness.  Clarke LJ said:
       34. In determining whether or not, in a case such  as  the  present,
           the need for immigration control outweighs the best interests of
           the children, it is necessary to determine the relative strength
           of the factors which make it in their best interests  to  remain
           here; and also to take account of any  factors  that  point  the
           other way.


       35. A decision as to what is in the best interests of children  will
           depend on a number of factors such as (a)  their  age;  (b)  the
           length of time that they have been here; (c) how long they  have
           been in education; (c) what stage their education  has  reached;
           (d) to what extent they have become distanced from  the  country
           to which it is proposed that  they  return;  (e)  how  renewable
           their connection with it may be; (f) to what  extent  they  will
           have linguistic, medical or other difficulties  in  adapting  to
           life in that country; and (g) the extent  to  which  the  course
           proposed will interfere with their family life or  their  rights
           (if they have any) as British citizens.


       36. In a sense the tribunal is concerned with how emphatic an answer
           falls to be given to the question: is it in the  best  interests
           of the child to remain? The longer the child has been here,  the
           more advanced (or critical) the  stage  of  his  education,  the
           looser his ties with the  country  in  question,  and  the  more
           deleterious the consequences of  his  return,  the  greater  the
           weight that falls  into  one  side  of  the  scales.  If  it  is
           overwhelmingly in the child's best interests that he should  not
           return, the need to maintain immigration control  may  well  not
           tip the balance. By contrast  if  it  is  in  the  child's  best
           interests to remain, but only  on  balance  (with  some  factors
           pointing the other way), the result may be the opposite.


       37. In the balance on the other side there falls to  be  taken  into
           account the strong weight to be given to the  need  to  maintain
           immigration control in pursuit of the economic well-being of the
           country and the fact that, ex hypothesi, the applicants have no
           entitlement to remain. The immigration history  of  the  parents
           may also be relevant e.g. if they are overstayers, or have acted
           deceitfully.
37.  Lewison LJ said:

         49.  Second, as Christopher Clarke LJ points out, the evaluation of
             the  best  interests  of  children  in  immigration  cases  is
             problematic.  In the  real  world,  the  appellant  is  almost
             always the parent who has no right to remain in the  UK.   The
             parent thus relies  on  the  best  interests  of  his  or  her
             children in order  to  piggyback  on  their  rights.   In  the
             present case, as  there  is  no  doubt  in  many  others,  the
             Immigration Judge made two findings about the children's  best
             interests:

             (a)  the best interests  of  the  children  are  obviously  to
                  remain with their parents; [29] and

             (b)  it is in the best interests of the  children  that  their
                  education in the UK [is] not to be disrupted [53].

         50.  What, if any, assumptions are to be made about the immigration
             status of the parent?  If one takes the facts as they  are  in
             reality, then the first of the  Immigration  Judge's  findings
             about  the  best  interests  of  the  children  point  towards
             removal.  If, on the other hand, one assumes that  the  parent
             has the right to remain, then one is assuming  the  answer  to
             the very question the Tribunal has to decide.  Or is there  is
             a middle ground, in which one has to assess the best interests
             of the children without regard to the  immigration  status  of
             the parent?

38.  The judge went on to analyse ZH (Tanzania) v  Secretary  of  State  for
    the Home Department [2011] UKSC 4 in order to elicit an answer to  this
    question.  He reached the following conclusion:

         58.   In  my  judgment,  therefore,  the  assessment  of  the  best
             interests of the children must be made on the basis the  facts
             are as they are in the real world.  One parent has no right to
             remain, but the other parent  does,  that  is  the  background
             against which the assessment is conducted.  If neither  parent
             has the right to remain, then that is the  background  against
             which the assessment is conducted.  Thus the ultimate question
             will be is it reasonable to expect the  child  to  follow  the
             parent with no right to remain to the country of origin?"

      On the facts of ZH it was not reasonable to  expect  the  children  to
      follow their mother to Tanzania, not least because the family would be
      separated and the children would be deprived of the right to  grow  up
      in the country of which they were citizens.  That was a long way  from
      the facts of the case before them.  No one in the family was a British
      citizen.  None had the right to remain in the country.  If the  mother
      was removed, the father had no independent right to remain.  With  the
      parents removed,  then  it  was  entirely  reasonable  to  expect  the
      children to go with them:

         Although it is, of course a question of fact for  the  Tribunal,  I
         cannot see that  the  desirability  of  being  educated  at  public
         expense in the UK can outweigh  the  benefit  to  the  children  of
         remaining with their parents.  Just as we  cannot  provide  medical
         treatment for the world, so we cannot educate the world.

      Jackson LJ agreed with both judgments.

39.  The "hypothetical" approach sanctioned by Christopher Clarke LJ  is  in
    line with the guidance given by the Upper Tribunal in MK (India)  which
    he cites with approval.  In MK, the Upper Tribunal emphasised the  need
    to conduct the initial best interest assessment without any immigration
    control overtones.  These only came into play when the  decision  maker
    moved on to a wider proportionality assessment.

40.   However,  the  "real  world"  approach  is  not   unprecedented.    In
    particular, it is reflected in the leading  speech  of  Lord  Hodge  in
    Zoumbas v Secretary of State [2013] UKSC 74, where  the  Supreme  Court
    dismissed an appeal against  removal  brought  by  a  Congolese  family
    comprising Mr and Mrs Zoumbas and two daughters, who had been  born  in
    the United Kingdom on 3 February 2007 and 14 April  2011  respectively.
    At paragraph [24] Lord Hodge said:

         There is no irrationality in the conclusion  that  it  was  in  the
         children's best interests to go with their parents to the  Republic
         of Congo.  No doubt it would have  been  possible  to  have  stated
         that, other things being equal, it was in the best interests of the
         children that they and their parents stayed in the  United  Kingdom
         so that they could obtain such benefits as healthcare and education
         which the decision maker recognised might be of a  higher  standard
         than would be available in the Congo. But  other  things  were  not
         equal.  They were not British  citizens.   They  had  no  right  to
         future education and healthcare in this country.  They were part of
         a close-knit family with highly educated parents and were of an age
         when their emotional needs could  only  be  fully  met  within  the
         immediate family unit.   Such  integration  as  had  occurred  into
         United Kingdom society would have been predominantly in the context
         of that  family  unit.   Most  significantly,  the  decision  maker
         concluded that they could be removed to the Republic  of  Congo  in
         the care of  their  parents  without  serious  detriment  to  their
         wellbeing.

41.  Thus the assessment of  reasonableness  is  a  holistic  one,  and  the
    immigration  status  and  history  of  the  parents   is   a   relevant
    consideration, following EV (Philippines).  The fact that  there  is  a
    qualifying child, either because the  child  has  accrued  seven  years
    residence in the UK or because the child is a British national, is  not
    a trump card, as otherwise there would not be a requirement to go on to
    consider whether, nonetheless, it is reasonable to expect the child  to
    leave the United Kingdom.

The relationship between s117B(6) and the Rules

42.  In AM (S117B) Malawi [2015] UKUT 260 (IAC) the Tribunal held  that  the
    duty of the  First-tier  Tribunal  was  quite  clear.   The  First-tier
    Tribunal was required  to  have  regard  to  considerations  listed  in
    Section  117B.   It  had  no  discretion  to   leave   any   of   those
    considerations out of account, if  it  was  a  consideration  that  was
    raised on the evidence before it.  The Tribunal continued in  paragraph
    [13]:

         There is also in our judgment no requirement that  the  FtT  should
         pose and answer the same question  more  than  once,  simply  as  a
         matter of form.  Thus since both  paragraph  276ADE(1)(iv)  of  the
         Immigration Rules, and S117B(6), both raise the  same  question  in
         relation to a particular child, of  whether  or  not  it  would  be
         reasonable to expect that child to leave the UK: it is  a  question
         that need only be answered once.

Disruption to education

43.  The facts of AM  were  that  AM  had  entered  the  United  Kingdom  in
    September 2006 as a student.  His last grant of  leave  to  remain  had
    expired on 2 December 2012.  In  the  meantime,  his  wife  and  eldest
    daughter were granted entry clearance to  join  him  as  dependants  in
    January 2007, and a second child was then born to the couple in the  UK
    on 3 April 2011.  All the family were citizens of Malawi.  As was  held
    by the Upper Tribunal  at  paragraph  [35],  the  eldest  child  was  a
    qualifying child as defined by Section 117D(1) by virtue  of  entry  to
    the UK in January 2007. It was not in  dispute  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal that she had lived in the UK for a continuous period of  seven
    years or more at the date of the appeal hearing, and as  a  result  the
    First-tier Tribunal was required to consider her position by  reference
    to Section 117B(6).  There was also no dispute that  the  appellant  as
    her father had a genuine and subsisting parental relationship with  his
    eldest daughter, and thus the only issue was whether or not it would be
    reasonable to expect her to  leave  the  UK.   At  paragraph  [39]  the
    Tribunal said:

         There was no reason to infer that any interruption of the education
         of the elder  child  upon  return  to  Malawi  would  be  any  more
         significant than that faced by any child forced to  move  from  one
         country to another by virtue of the careers of their parents.   Nor
         should the difficulties of a move from one school to another become
         unduly exaggerated.  It would be highly unusual for a child in  the
         UK to complete the entirety of their education within  one  school.
         The trauma, or excitement, of a new school, new classmates and  new
         teachers is an integral part of growing up.  In  too  many  appeals
         the FtT is presented with arguments whose basic premise is that  to
         change a school is to submit a child to a cruel  and  unduly  harsh
         experience.

44.  The Tribunal went on to find that the judge was entitled  to  conclude,
    as she did, that there was every reason to suppose that  both  children
    would be able to access both primary and secondary education in Malawi.
     There was no evidential basis on which the judge could find either  of
    them would be denied the opportunity of  tertiary  education,  and  the
    ability to  access  it  if  they  attained  the  educational  threshold
    requirements.

The Best Interests of the Claimant's children

45.  Overall, I find that the best  interest  considerations  militating  in
    favour of the children returning to Nigeria  with  their  mother  as  a
    family unit outweigh the best interest considerations which favour them
    remaining here.  The children are  nationals  of  Nigeria,  and  so  by
    relocating to Nigeria they will  be  able  to  enjoy  the  benefits  of
    Nigerian citizenship, and the benefit  of  being  brought  up  for  the
    remainder of their minority in the  social  and  cultural  milieu  from
    which both their parents spring.  They have not  accrued  seven  years'
    residence from the age of four, and they are both young enough to adapt
    to life in Nigeria with the support of their mother.  Since  they  have
    been partially brought up within a Nigerian diaspora, I find  that  the
    culture and society in Nigeria, where English is  widely  spoken,  will
    not be alien to them. As of July 2014 Child T was in Class 2 and  Child
    V was in Class 1 of a Catholic Primary School. Both  of  them  received
    glowing end of year school reports. They  are  clearly  flourishing  at
    school, and are making good academic progress, as confirmed by the head
    teacher of the school in a letter dated 28 April 2015.  But  they  have
    not reached a critical stage of their education (such as being about to
    take GCSEs), and they can continue  their  education  in  Nigeria.  The
    claimant is a good and devoted parent (according to the head  teacher),
    and I attach no credence to the suggestion that she will  not  properly
    care for the children in Nigeria.

46.  I also attach no credence to the claimant's evidence  that  her  second
    child has facial hair which will make her vulnerable to accusations  of
    being a witch. The claimant has not sought to discharge the  burden  of
    proving, even to the lower standard of proof appropriate to  protection
    claims, that her account of past persecution  is  true,  including  her
    claim to have been accused of being a witch because she  had  a  beard;
    and so her evidence about her second child, which is wholly unsupported
    by  evidence  from  an  independent  source,  presents  as  a  complete
    fabrication.

Wider Proportionality Considerations

47.  In the wider  proportionality  assessment,  it  is  in  the  claimant's
    favour that she and the children all speak English.  But they  are  not
    financially independent, and the children are being  educated  here  at
    public expense.  The claimant has established private and  family  life
    here unlawfully, and she has aggravated her  immigration  offending  by
    working illegally. She has testimonials as to her good character  from,
    among others, her parish priest and the head  teacher  of  the  primary
    school which the girls attend. But under the statute little weight  can
    be given to a private life which has been built  up  while  a  person's
    status in the UK is unlawful.

48.  So I find it is reasonable to expect the qualifying children to  return
    to Nigeria with their mother, and I consider that the decision appealed
    against strikes a fair balance between, on the one hand, the rights and
    interests of the claimant and the children, and, on the other hand, the
    wider interests of society.  It  is  proportionate  to  the  legitimate
    public end  sought  to  be  achieved,  namely  the  protection  of  the
    country's economic wellbeing and the prevention of disorder.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  contained  an  error  of  law,  and
accordingly the  decision  is  set  aside  and  the  following  decision  is
substituted: this appeal is dismissed under the Rules and also  outside  the
Rules under Article 8 ECHR.


Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court  directs  otherwise,  the  claimant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify her  or  any  member  of  her  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to the claimant.  Failure to  comply  with
this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
