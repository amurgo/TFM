For the Respondent:    Mr Hussain a Solicitor


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background

      1. For ease of reference and continuity with the First-tier  Tribunal,
         I shall refer to the Entry Clearance Officer as the Respondent  and
         Mrs Iftikhar as the Appellant.

      2. The Respondent refused the Appellant's  application  for  leave  to
         enter as a spouse on 30  October  2014.  Her  appeal  against  that
         decision was allowed  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Pacey  ("the
         Judge") following a hearing on 2 January 2015.

The grant of permission

      3. First-tier Tribunal Judge Ford granted  permission  to  appeal  (17
         February 2015) on the ground that;

             "It is arguable that Judge Pacey did not have evidence  before
             her on which to be satisfied that the  Appellant  was  earning
             the required level of income during  the  relevant  period  as
             evidenced by the specified evidence."

      4. I point out here that there was a clear typographical error in  the
         grant as the obligation is for  the  Appellant  to  show  that  her
         Sponsor is earning  the  required  level  of  income  and  not  the
         Appellant herself.

Submissions

      5. The Appellant did not file a rule 24 reply. Mr Hussain argued  that
         the Judge took the view that the later evidence could be considered
         even if it was not with the application.  The  additional  evidence
         was submitted prior to the Respondent's decision.

      6. Mr Mills submitted that Appendix FM-SE 2 (a) of  the  Statement  of
         Changes in Immigration Rules HC395 ("the rules") are clear in  that
         (my underlining):

             "In respect of salaried employment in the UK ...  all  of  the
             following evidence must be provided:

                  (a)  Payslips covering:

                      (i)   a period of 6  months  prior  to  the  date  of
                      application if the person has been employed by  their
                      current employer for at least 6 months ..."

The Judge's findings

      7. The Judge found as follows;

             "[8]      In  his  statement  dated  12th  November  2013  the
             Sponsor refers to a  gross  salary  from  Amazon  of  �15,704.
             Matters have, however moved on since then as the Sponsor  said
             that he had a promotion at Amazon. He initially worked through
             an agency for Amazon but in due course was taken on  full-time
             and, again in due course, had a promotion. That  explains  why
             the P60 for the financial year ending April  2014  only  shows
             pay of �8,337.64. There is, however, an  annual  tax  summary.
             This appears at page 141 of the bundle provided by  on  behalf
             of the Appellant. The tax summary is an official document  and
             has  clear  probative  value.  It  is   not   challenged   for
             reliability on behalf of the Respondent  and  nothing  on  the
             face  of  it  gives  reasonable  grounds  for   doubting   its
             reliability. This document shows that the Revenue recorded the
             taxable income of the Sponsor, for the financial  year  ending
             April 2014, as �18,706.26. That document reflects the evidence
             of the Sponsor,  to  the  effect  that  his  wages  at  Amazon
             increased, when he was taken on  full-time  and  when  he  was
             given a promotion. The figure recorded in  the  HMRC  document
             which I have referred is in excess of the  �18,600  threshold.
             Quite apart from the HMRC letter  the  oral  evidence  of  the
             Sponsor, at the hearing, is supported by the  Amazon  payslips
             included in his bundle.

             [9] The Notice of Appeal included in the  Respondent's  bundle
             indicates that the  appeal  is  in  respect  of  the  original
             decision. At the time of both decisions, however,  it  appears
             to me on the totality of the documentary  evidence  before  me
             that the Sponsor met the relevant criteria of Appendix  FM  in
             that his income was in excess of the threshold provided.  That
             income is from Amazon. For the reasons set out  above  I  have
             disregarded any income from A1 Cars. The Respondent  does  not
             contend that the evidential requirements in  relation  to  the
             Amazon income have not been met ..."

Discussion

      8. It is not challenged that the finding made by the Judge that the A1
         Cars income could not be taken into account, as the cash income was
         not reflected in the bank statements produced.

      9. At the date of the  application,  the  Sponsor  worked  for  Amazon
         through an agency  called  Industrious  Ltd.  The  payslip  for  27
         October  2013  (that  being  the  latest  payslip  prior   to   the
         application) identified to then a gross annual income of �9,196.68.
         That was almost 7 months into the financial year. Even doubling  it
         would not reach the required �18,600 threshold.  He  did  not  have
         sufficient savings to "top up" the shortfall as his savings did not
         exceed �16,000 as evidenced by his bank statements  as  the  latest
         one identified a balance on 20 September 2013 as �17.65.

     10. The rules are explicit in that the evidence to support the  meeting
         of  the  income  threshold  had  to  have   been   submitted   with
         application. In this case that did not happen as  evidence  of  the
         Amazon income the fell below the threshold.  The  Judge  materially
         erred in not applying the rule correctly.

     11. I am therefore satisfied that the Judge made a  material  error  of
         law. I set the decision aside.

Rehearing

     12. Both representatives asked me to remake the  decision  rather  than
         remitting it. I agreed that this was the most appropriate course of
         action.

     13. The evidence submitted with the application  identified  an  income
         through agency work of less than the required threshold of  �18,600
         (see [9] above). The rules are explicit in  that  the  evidence  to
         support the meeting of  the  income  threshold  had  to  have  been
         submitted with application. In this case that  did  not  happen  as
         evidence of the Sponsors income the fell below the threshold.

     14. I therefore dismiss the appeal under the Immigration Rules.

     15. I can only consider Article  8  outside  the  rules  if  there  are
         arguably good grounds for  granting  leave  to  enter  outside  the
         rules, or  compelling  circumstances  not  sufficiently  recognised
         under them. If there are, I can only allow an Article 8  appeal  if
         the 5 Razgar questions are answered in the affirmative.

     16. In considering human rights there is only  a  small  gap  where  an
         appeal can be allowed outside the rules where they do not provide a
         complete code. I must consider human  rights  as  at  today's  date
         through the prism of the rules which are the starting point for  my
         consideration of them. Even  where  the  rules  do  not  provide  a
         "complete code" they help  illuminate  the  regulatory  and  policy
         context which I need to take into account.

     17. In my judgement these rules do provide a complete code  as  I  have
         been able to spell them out above with clarity. I do not  therefore
         see any "gap" to consider human rights.

     18. Even if I am wrong in that, I would have dismissed the  appeal  for
         all the following reasons.

     19. The decision to refuse entry clearance does not interfere with  the
         couple's right to respect for their family  and  private  life.  It
         maintains the status quo  they  decided  was  most  appropriate  of
         getting married before the Appellant received entry clearance.

     20.  It  has  not  been  established  that  the  decision   can   cause
         consequences of gravity even given the low  threshold  involved  as
         all they need to do is reapply in the usual  way  and  produce  the
         specified evidence to the Respondent who  will  assess  it  in  the
         usual way. It is lawful given the failure to meet the rules and for
         the legitimate aim of ensuring that the economic well being of  the
         country is shown to be maintained.

     21. Given how the couple, in the application, failed by the  production
         of specified evidence under the rules to establish that at the date
         of the decision they met the relevant financial threshold, and  the
         ease with  which  that  can  be  addressed,  namely  the  Appellant
         submitting  the  specified  evidence,  it  is  in  my  judgement  a
         proportionate response to the need to maintain  the  economic  well
         being of the country to require them to prove that  they  now  meet
         the relevant maintenance  thresholds  and  reapply  when  they  can
         establish to the Respondent that they do so.  The  speed  they  are
         able to do so is in their hands.

Decision:

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.

    I set aside the decision.

    I dismiss the appeal.
