Representation:

For the Appellant:       Mr R Solomon of Counsel, instructed by M A
                    Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr K Norton, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. The appellant has  been  granted  permission  to  appeal  against  the
      decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Birk to dismiss her human rights
      appeal on 19 October 2016. She is a national of Zambia born on 2 March
      1982 who  entered  the  UK  as  a  visitor.  Two  previous  article  8
      applications were refused, one with an appeal which was dismissed, and
      one with no right of appeal. She relies on family life with a  British
      national, Mr Bland. She has a child from a previous  relationship  and
      was expecting a baby with her current  partner  at  the  date  of  the
      hearing. That child was born shortly thereafter.


    2. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Adio  on  17
       February 2017  on  the  basis  that  the  judge  arguably  erred  in
       assessing the mental health facilities (for the appellant's partner)
       in Zambia and proceeded on the basis that his mental health problems
       were a past rather than an on-going state of affairs.


    The Hearing


    3. At the hearing on  7  April  2017,  I  heard  submissions  from  the
       parties. The appellant was present.


    4. Mr Solomon relied upon his grounds. He submitted that there had been
       a flawed consideration of the medical evidence by the judge who,  at
       paragraph 17, had referred to Mr Bland's health issues as  being  in
       the past when they were ongoing and he remained  on  medication  and
       under care in the community. He submitted that  error  had  infected
       her findings on the availability of medical facilities for Mr  Bland
       in Zambia. Having found that the facilities  were  poor,  the  judge
       then found that Mr Bland could receive treatment. There had been  no
       consideration of the  fact  that  his  psychotic  episode  had  been
       triggered by stress and that relocation to Zambia would be extremely
       stressful.

    5. Mr Solomon further submitted that  the  judge  had  failed  to  take
       account of the documentary evidence on  the  discrimination  against
       individuals with health issues  looking  for  employment.  Both  the
       appellant and Mr Bland fell into this category.  The  discrimination
       against them and difficulties in finding employment would impact  on
       their ability to relocate. He submitted that the best  interests  of
       the appellant's child had not been properly considered and there was
       no consideration of the part Mr Bland played  in  her  life,  having
       been there for her since she was a few months old.  Crucial  aspects
       of the  evidence  had  been  disregarded  when  the  assessment  was
       undertaken.

    6. Mr Solomon submitted that the judge had also failed to take  account
       of the delay in the enforcement action taken by the respondent. That
       reduced the weight to be given to the public  interest  in  removal.
       The Chikwamba point had not been addressed either  although  it  was
       argued in the skeleton argument.

    7. Mr Norton responded. He submitted that the  appellant  had  to  show
       there would be  insurmountable  obstacles  to  the  continuation  of
       family life overseas. He submitted that in  assessing  the  evidence
       regarding Mr Bland's illness, the judge had properly summarised this
       condition and treatment at paragraph 17. Mr Bland had been diagnosed
       with depression and autism and Asperger's syndrome  had  been  ruled
       out. He no longer required specialist or  rare  medication  and  had
       returned to work on a phased basis. Save for medication  and  health
       care monitoring, there was no  definitive  diagnosis  as  to  future
       mental healthcare. The judge could not speculate and had to  make  a
       decision on the available evidence. She found that  he  was  on  the
       slow road to recovery. That was a fair summation  of  the  evidence.
       The judge also found that Mr Bland was not in need of primary health
       care and that he would be able to access secondary or tertiary care.




    8. Mr Norton submitted that the judge had considered the best interests
       of the appellant's daughter adequately.


    9. With regard to the Chikwamba point, the sponsor had  demonstrated  a
       skill in employment and could make use of those skills in Zambia. It
       was not sufficient to argue  that  he  had  the  potential  to  earn
       ï¿½50,000 per annum. He had been working full time when he earned that
       income but was now down to 20 hours a week and so would  be  earning
       less.  There  had  been  no  delay  in  the  consideration  of   the
       application. The appellant had been required to leave in  2006  when
       she lost her appeal. The respondent's failure to enforce her removal
       had only benefited the appellant. She should  not  be  rewarded  for
       overstaying. Her relationship was formed at a precarious period  and
       even if there had been specific  consideration  of  117B,  no  other
       outcome would have been possible. The appeal should be dismissed.


   10. In response Mr Solomon submitted that  Mr  Bland  suffered  from  an
       ongoing disorder and was on anti-psychotic drugs. It  was  necessary
       to consider whether he would be able to access health care in Zambia
       as a foreign national. This was an argument raised on behalf of  the
       appellant but was not considered by the judge.  Delay,  in  general,
       was  a   pertinent   matter   that   required   consideration.   The
       precariousness of the  appellant's  stay  was  not  a  determinative
       factor but one of many issues that had to be considered.

   11. That completed the submissions. At the conclusion of the  hearing  I
       reserved my determination which I now give.


         Discussion and Findings


   12. In reaching my findings, I  have  taken  careful  note  of  all  the
       submissions and the evidence relied on by the  parties,  whether  or
       not it is specifically referred to in my determination.


   13. Whilst I accept that the judge described Mr Bland as suffering  from
       a mental illness at the start of the  contentious  paragraph  17,  I
       accept Mr Solomon's submission that a full reading of that paragraph
       suggests that she considered that there was one psychotic episode in
       2016, that his problems had since passed and that having returned to
       work, albeit part time, he was recovering. The  difficulty  is  that
       the judge appears to have related the condition to a past  psychotic
       incident without appreciating that  the  situation  is  tenuous  and
       could flare up again with stress. Mr Bland continues to be monitored
       and is still under supervision. Whilst it  is  true,  as  Mr  Norton
       submitted, that the judge could not speculate on what the future may
       hold, she should have had regard to the fact that it was stress that
       caused the past episodes and that having to relocate to Zambia could
       well be a very stressful experience for  Mr  Bland.  This  had  been
       argued before her.


   14. Additionally, the judge failed, in my view, to have proper regard to
       whether Mr Bland would be able to access health care in  Zambia.  He
       is a British citizen and apart from the issue of whether he would be
       entitled to  whatever  care  was  available,  there  was  no  proper
       consideration of whether the care would be adequate for  his  needs,
       given that it was found to be extremely poor (at paragraph 18),  and
       how this would impact on the ability of the family to  relocate  and
       continue their lives in Zambia. The  evidence,  in  fact,  indicates
       that there is a lack of provision for mental health at both  primary
       and secondary levels  (p.  4;  ZAMPHOR  report)  and  suggests  that
       discrimination is a  major  issue  against  those  who  have  health
       conditions (US State Department report). Both the appellant  and  Mr
       Bland fall into this category and so whilst the judge found that  Mr
       Bland would be able to work and support  the  family,  she  did  not
       consider the possibility that he may not be able  to  work  at  all,
       given his health and the stigma attached to those with mental health
       problems.  Nor was there any consideration of whether  it  would  be
       reasonable to expect Mr Bland, a British national with no  links  to
       Zambia, to move there. This is a particularly serious failing in the
       determination, given the present authorities on the matter.


   15. There are also difficulties over  the  manner  in  which  the  judge
       considered the best interests of the appellant's daughter. Mr  Bland
       has been part of her life since she was a few  months  old  and  yet
       there  has  been  no  consideration  in  the  assessment  of  how  a
       separation from the only father she has ever known (if Mr Bland  did
       not  choose  to  travel  to   Zambia)   would   impact   upon   her.
       Additionally, the judge failed to engage with section  117B  or  the
       arguments made with respect to the Chikwamba guidance and the matter
       of the delay in enforcement action.


   16. Taken cumulatively, the judge's errors are  such  that  I  must  set
       aside her decision. I do not preserve any findings. I note, however,
       that the  respondent  rightly  conceded  that  the  relationship  is
       genuine and subsisting. Unless  there  are  any  developments  which
       would undermine that concession, the appellant can assume  that  the
       next hearing shall proceed on that basis.


   17. Mr Solomon asked that the matter be remitted back to the  First-tier
       Tribunal for a fresh hearing if an error of law was  found.  I  have
       considered whether to keep the matter  in  the  Upper  Tribunal  but
       given Mr Solomon's request and the fact that the matter  shall  have
       to be determined afresh on all matters, I accede to it.




    Decision


    18.    The decision is set aside and shall be re-made at a future  date
    by              the First-tier Tribunal.


    Signed
