Anonymity

Rule 14: The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008
An anonymity direction was made by the First-tier Tribunal. As a protection
claim and one which refers to minor children, it is appropriate to continue
that direction.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Secretary of State appeals with permission against the decision  of
    a First-tier Tribunal (Judge Rayner) which in a decision promulgated on
    7th July 2017, allowed Ms C.A.O.'s  appeal  against  the  Secretary  of
    State's refusal to grant her leave to remain  in  the  United  Kingdom.
    The Appellant's appeal was allowed on human rights grounds  only.   The
    appeal against the refusal of her protection claim was dismissed.

 2. For the sake of clarity, I shall throughout this decision refer to  the
    Secretary of State as  "the  Respondent"  and  to  Ms  C.A.O.  as  "the
    Appellant", reflecting their respective positions before the First-tier
    Tribunal.

Background

 3. Judge Rayner noted in his decision that the Appellant has a complicated
    immigration  and  litigation  history.   He  set  out  the  Appellant's
    background fully and it is reproduced here for  the  purposes  of  this
    decision:

         "2.  The appellant has a  complicated  immigration  and  litigation
             history:

                 i) She has a daughter, C, born in Kenya on 4 March 2000.

                ii) The appellant entered the United Kingdom on  20  January
                    2002, on an entry clearance visa as a student valid from
                    11 October 2001 to 30 October 2003.  No application  was
                    made in respect of C.

               iii) In 2003, the appellant married in  the  United  Kingdom.
                    She applied for leave to  remain  as  a  spouse,  on  23
                    October  2003.   That  application  was  refused  on   1
                    December 2003.

                iv) The appellant applied for leave as the dependant  spouse
                    of a work permit holder on 29  December  2003,  and  was
                    granted leave in that category until 20 February 2008.

                 v) The appellant's relationship with her husband broke down
                    in 2004.

                vi) The appellant applied for  leave  for  C  to  enter  the
                    United Kingdom on 25 October  2004.   She  attended  the
                    British  High  Commission  in  Nairobi  to   make   that
                    application, which was refused on 1 November  2004.   An
                    appeal against that decision  was  refused:  information
                    about this application  recorded  from  the  appellant's
                    Professional Conduct Panel  hearing,  page  181  of  the
                    appellant bundle.

               vii) In 2005 the Appellant met and subsequently went  through
                    a customary ceremony of marriage with Mr EO.

              viii) On 30 August 2005, C entered the United Kingdom with  an
                    entry visa issued in Nairobi, valid from 9  August  2005
                    to 9 February  2006.   That  visa  had  been  unlawfully
                    obtained, under a false identity.

                ix) The appellant returned to Kenya in 2007,  leaving  C  in
                    the care of friends in the United Kingdom.  She  applied
                    for an entry clearance visa from Kenya as a work  permit
                    holder.  She was a teacher.  That visa was granted  from
                    24 August 2007 to 24 August 2008.  The appellant did not
                    mention C's continued presence in the United Kingdom  on
                    that application.

                 x) On 25 June 2008 the appellant applied for  leave  remain
                    (sic) as a work permit holder.  Her leave  was  extended
                    until 24 August 2011.  The appellant did not mention C's
                    presence in the United Kingdom on that application.

                xi) In total the appellant left and returned to  the  United
                    Kingdom on five  occasions  in  2008  and  2009,  having
                    visited Kenya  or  America  on  each  occasion:  Q  2.10
                    Screening Interview.

               xii) On 11 January  2010  the  appellant  and  Mr  EO  had  a
                    daughter born in the United Kingdom, V.

              xiii) The appellant made an application for  leave  to  remain
                    under Tier 2  on  19  August  2010,  but  withdrew  that
                    application on 10 October 2012.

               xiv) On 22 June 2011 the appellant was arrested for  passport
                    and immigration offences in relation to the entry of her
                    daughter [C] in the United Kingdom on 30 August 2005.

                xv) On 22 July 2011  the  appellant  applied  for  leave  to
                    remain outside of the Immigration  Rules  and  this  was
                    refused on 16 August 2011.

               xvi) On 24 August 2011 the appellant made an Article 8  human
                    rights application.  That application named Mr EO, C and
                    V as her dependants.

              xvii) On 14 December 2011  the  appellant  was  sentenced  for
                    offences of possession/control of an  identity  document
                    with intent and assisting unlawful immigration  into  an
                    EU member state.  She received  an  eight  month  prison
                    sentence suspended for two  years  and  was  ordered  to
                    undertake 120 hours of community work.

             xviii) On 10 April 2012, the respondent refused the appellant's
                    application  made  on  24  August  2011.   She  appealed
                    against that decision, and on 20 June  2012  the  appeal
                    was allowed to the  limited  extent  that  the  Tribunal
                    required the respondent to reconsider her decision.

               xix) On 15  January  2013  the  respondent  reconsidered  and
                    confirmed her decision.  The appellant appealed  against
                    that decision on 30 January 2013.

                xx) On 22 March 2013 the Professional  Conduct  Panel  found
                    that the appellant's conviction were  (sic)  "relevant",
                    but did not recommend a prohibition order: pages 181  ff
                    appellant bundle.

               xxi) On 5 June 2013, the  appellant  claimed  asylum  in  the
                    United Kingdom.  She was interviewed in respect of  that
                    claim on 18 February 2014.

              xxii) On 17 December  2013  the  appellant  was  convicted  of
                    failing to provide a specimen of  breath  for  analysis,
                    and was fined  and  disqualified  from  driving  for  16
                    months.

             xxiii) The appeal  against  the  respondent's  decision  of  15
                    January 2013 was allowed on 30 October  2014,  again  to
                    the  limited  extent  that  that  (sic)  respondent  was
                    required to consider her decision: page 122 ff appellant
                    bundle.

              xxiv) On 18 May 2016 the respondent refused the asylum  claim.
                    That refusal letter dealt with the appellant's situation
                    under Article 8 of  the  ECHR.   On  22  June  2016  the
                    appellant appealed against that refusal.

               xxv) On 9 June 2016 the respondent reconsidered  and  refused
                    the appellant's appeal in respect of  her  human  rights
                    claim.  On 22 June 2016 the appellant  appealed  against
                    the refusal - HU/17249/2016.  Note - the  Tribunal  file
                    in respect of this appeal was not before  the  Tribunal.
                    The only copy of the decision was at pages 51 ff of  the
                    appellant bundle.  The Tribunal history  report  of  the
                    file showed that the appeal  had  been  administratively
                    closed on 19 August 2016 due to non-payment of the  fee.
                    However, in a determination by Tribunal Caseworker Early
                    on 24 October 2016, the fee requirement was waived,  and
                    an extension of time granted  for  lodging  the  appeal:
                    page 11 appellant bundle.  There was therefore  a  valid
                    appeal before the Tribunal.

              xxvi) The appeals came before  the  Tribunal  on  15  December
                    2016.    First-tier   Tribunal   Judge    Wellesley-Cole
                    adjourned the appeal  at  the  respondent's  request  to
                    enable her to reconsider the  matter  in  light  of  the
                    additional documents provided in the  appellant  bundle:
                    the only records of this hearing are on the  right  hand
                    side of the Tribunal bundle.

             xxvii) The appeals again came before the  Tribunal  on  9  June
                    2017.  The respondent had not reconsidered the matter in
                    the meantime, but there was no application for a further
                    adjournment, and the parties accepted that whatever  the
                    technicalities, all relevant  matters  were  before  the
                    Tribunal."

 4. Following the background information, the judge went on to consider the
    Appellant's appeal against the  Respondent's  refusal  of  asylum.   In
    setting out his decision on that part of  the  Appellant's  claim,  the
    judge analysed the claim itself. He summarised the claim and noted that
    in essence the Appellant said she feared her half-brother, whom it  was
    said was instrumental in helping bring C unlawfully into  the  UK.   It
    was said that the Claimant's half-brother had threatened to kill her on
    account  of  her  mentioning  his  name  in  the  criminal  proceedings
    following her arrest for immigration offences.

 5.  Suffice  to  say  for  the  purposes  of  this  decision,  the   judge
    comprehensively disbelieved the asylum claim and found no part of  what
    the Appellant said  to  be  creditworthy.   Setting  out  his  properly
    constructed  reasons  over  several  lengthy  paragraphs,   the   judge
    concluded at [43] the following:

         "The appellant is not  a  credible  witness.   She  has  used  many
         methods to secure leave to remain in the United  Kingdom,  and  has
         been selective about the information she  discloses  on  many  such
         applications.  I remind myself that even if the  appellant  is  not
         credible and elements of her account are not proved to the required
         standard, the essence of her account may be truthful and  form  the
         basis of a valid asylum claim.  However, I do not find that is  the
         case in this instance.  The protection claim is another  method  by
         which the appellant has attempted to secure leave to remain,  at  a
         time that her status in the United  Kingdom  had  been  precarious.
         She has not established to any degree of likelihood that she  faces
         a threat from her half-brother in Kenya."

 6. The judge then went on to dismiss the Appellant's protection claim.   I
    pause here to note that the appeal before me against the FtT's decision
    has been brought by the Respondent.  There has been no challenge raised
    by the Appellant's representative either by way of cross-appeal  or  by
    way of challenging any  of  the  findings  that  the  judge  made  with
    reference to the Appellant's protection claim.  Therefore I record that
    the judge's finding that the Appellant is not in need of  international
    protection stands, as does his finding that  the  Appellant  is  not  a
    credible witness who has used many methods to secure leave to remain in
    the United Kingdom.

 7. This brings me to the issue now before me.  The FtTJ, having  made  his
    findings that the Appellant's protection claim was not made out, turned
    his mind to the  Appellant's  Article  8  ECHR  claim.   He  noted  the
    following within [44]:

         "Ms Muzira  however  relies  heavily  in  her  representations  and
         skeleton argument on the situation of the appellant's  children  in
         the appeal.  She is right to do so.  The appellant's offending  and
         immigration history is poor.  For the reasons I give  below,  there
         is no prospect that considered separately from  her  children  that
         her appeal, could succeed on any ground."

 8. The judge then made findings within [50]  considering  the  Appellant's
    private life and said the following:

         "I discount any suggestion that she would be  at  risk  on  return.
         Her mother still lives in Kenya.  According to paragraph 31 of  her
         witness statement, she has a number of brothers, sisters and  other
         family in Kenya, many of whom still live with  her  mother.   Until
         2009 she regularly visited Kenya.  She  is  well  educated  with  a
         professional qualification.  It may be a very  different  life  for
         her in Kenya, and not one to which she wishes to return.   However,
         she would have every prospect of maintaining herself in Kenya, with
         support from her family, while she re-establishes herself.  Indeed,
         she  acknowledged  that  to  be  the  case  when  she  answered  Ms
         Hitschman's questions.  The appellant cannot  satisfy  the  private
         life provisions of the Immigration Rules."

    There is no challenge to those findings and accordingly I see no reason
    to interfere with them. They stand.

 9. The FtTJ then looked at what now amounts to the  central  issue  before
    me.  He directed himself at [52] that this is an appeal which  involves
    children and that it is  well-established  that  any  consideration  of
    their status must consider their best interests as a primary factor. He
    found at [53] that for both children their best interests are to remain
    with their mother, whether that be in the United Kingdom or Kenya.

10. The FtT then made several findings saying:

         "54. In relation to C, I find the following:

               i) She was born on 4 March 2000 in Kenya.  She  came  to  the
                  United Kingdom on 30 August 2005, and has lived here since
                  then.  There have been periods of time when the  appellant
                  has left C in the United Kingdom and returned to Kenya  or
                  visited America, including in 2007, when she  returned  to
                  Kenya to make application for leave to enter.

              ii) There are no issues raised  about  C's  contact  with  her
                  stepfather Mr EO.

             iii) C is a highly gifted  pupil  at  her  school.   There  are
                  numerous positive testimonials from her school: pages 128-
                  168 appellant bundle.  She passed nine GCSEs  at  grade  A
                  and one at  Grade  C  in  2016:  appellant's  supplemental
                  evidence bundle.  She has what her school  believe  to  be
                  realistic aspirations to attend Cambridge University.  The
                  testimonials all attest to her integration into the school
                  and her local community.

         55.  In relation to V, I note the following:

               i) She was born in the United Kingdom  on  11  January  2010.
                  She has lived her whole life in the United Kingdom.

              ii) The  appellant  has  provided  no  information  about  the
                  relationship between V and her father.  In  principle,  it
                  would be in V's best interest to  have  at  least  contact
                  with  him,  but  given  the  appellant's   reluctance   to
                  elaborate on her own relationship with Mr EO, I can  place
                  little reliance on that.

             iii) The appellant has provided information from when V was  in
                  a nursery placement: undated letter  from  Health  Visitor
                  page 169 appellant bundle.  Similarly, a letter  from  the
                  nursery is undated (pages 170-171 appellant bundle) but it
                  refers to the family, including V's father, being a "close
                  nit (sic) family".  I have nothing subsequently about  V's
                  schooling or private life in the United Kingdom.  I assume
                  that she is in similar circumstances to  any  other  child
                  who has lived for her whole life of  seven  years  in  the
                  United Kingdom.

              iv) V suffers from sickle cell anaemia.  Dr Gattens provides a
                  comprehensive  report,  dated  7  December  2016,  on  her
                  condition and treatment at pages 126-127 of the  appellant
                  bundle.  Dr Gattens gives a general account of sickle cell
                  anaemia, and goes on  to  describe  V's  recent  emergency
                  treatment:

                  'V ... has previously  required  admission  to  her  local
                  hospital for pain relief and intravenous fluids  during  a
                  crisis.  She has recently (03.12.16) required admission to
                  the paedeatric (sic) intensive care at  Addenbrokes  (sic)
                  with a  chest  crisis.   During  this  admission  she  was
                  ventilated and required intravenous  fluids,  opoid  (sic)
                  pain  relief  and  exchange  transfusion.   She  currently
                  remains an inpatient.  Without access  to  the  paediatric
                  intensive care services  this  crisis  would  have  proved
                  fatal.

                  Dr  Gattens  describes  the  ongoing  treatment   that   V
                  requires.  He is concerned that '... if V was to  be  sent
                  back to Kenya that  she  will  not  receive  the  required
                  medical care and she could potentially have  many  of  the
                  complication of her sickle cell  disease  that  have  been
                  describe above leading to her experience a high  level  of
                  mortality and an increased risk of morbidity.'

                  Dr  Gattens  goes  on  to   describe,   with   appropriate
                  references, the treatment of sickle cell anaemia in Kenya,
                  which he describes  as  wholly  inadequate,  quoting,  for
                  example,  that  'The   Kenyan   children's   sickle   cell
                  foundation ask for donations  on  their  website  to  help
                  cover the cost of basic drugs such  as  penicillin  V  and
                  folic acid which are the minimum standard requirements for
                  sickle cell patients, as they  are  not  widely  available
                  otherwise.'

               v)  The  respondent  also  deals  with  the  availability  of
                  treatment for sickle cell anaemia in  Kenya  at  paragraph
                  116-117 of the 18 May 2016 refusal letter.  The assessment
                  is based  on  the  MedCOI  report.   The  availability  of
                  treatment in Kenya for sickle cell anaemia is not  at  the
                  same level as it is in the United Kingdom.   However,  the
                  lack of resources in Kenya is not  such  that  V's  rights
                  under Article 3 of the ECHR, would be breached.  V's  best
                  interests  would  be  to  continue  to   receive   medical
                  treatment in the United Kingdom.  However,  the  disparity
                  of  medical  treatment  does  not  of  itself  create   an
                  exceptional circumstance."

11. Finally at [60] the  judge  set  out  that  a  freestanding  Article  8
    consideration must be viewed through the prism of Section 117B  of  the
    2002 Nationality, Asylum and Immigration Act.  This then brought him to
    Section 117B(6) and, after finding that both C  and  V  are  qualifying
    children he turned  his  attention  to  whether  or  not  it  would  be
    reasonable to expect both C and V to leave the United Kingdom.   Having
    directed himself on the leading case of MA  (Pakistan)  v  SSHD  [2016]
    EWCA Civ 705 the FtTJ said this at [62]:

         "Given my findings of fact about C and V, I conclude that it is  in
         their best interests to remain in  the  United  Kingdom.   I  weigh
         against that the appellant's poor immigration history,  the  public
         importance in maintaining immigration control and my  finding  that
         the appellant could maintain  the  family  in  Kenya.   On  balance
         however, I do find, given the length of time they have spent in the
         United Kingdom and their integration into United  Kingdom  culture,
         education and social norms, that it would not  be  "reasonable"  to
         expect C or V to return to  Kenya.   By  making  that  finding,  it
         follows  the  (sic)  C  satisfies  paragraph  276ADE(iv)   of   the
         Immigration Rules; that the appellant satisfies the  provisions  of
         EX.1 to Appendix M to the Immigration Rules; that both C and V  are
         "qualifying children" for the purposes of section 117B of the  2002
         Act, and their removal would not be "reasonable " to expect  either
         of them to leave the United Kingdom. Under section 117B(6)  of  the
         Act therefore there is no public interest in  the  removal  of  the
         appellant. It follows, in terms of Agyarko  that  the  decision  to
         refuse the appellant's application is not  proportionate,  so  that
         her appeal succeeds."

    He then allowed the Appellant's appeal on human rights grounds.

Onward Appeal

12. The Respondent  sought  permission  to  appeal.   The  grounds  seeking
    permission set out in summary:

       . The judge has  failed  to  conduct  a  proper  balancing  exercise,
         because when assessing the question of reasonableness under Section
         117B(6), he has focused solely on the position of  the  Appellant's
         children.

       . In particular the FtTJ erred in failing to  consider  the  cost  of
         educating both of the Appellant's children and failed  to  consider
         the cost of providing ongoing medical facilities to both  children.



       . The public interest in maintaining an effective immigration control
         had not been afforded sufficient weight as  there  are  no  factors
         relied upon which would amount to significant obstacles  and  there
         is no disproportionate breach of Article 8 family  life  which  can
         continue in Kenya, as can comparable private life.

13. The grounds sought in particular to rely upon AE (Algeria) v  Secretary
    of State for the Home Department [2014] EWCA Civ 653 and Zoumbas v SSHD
    [2013] UKSC 74.

14. Permission was granted by the FtT (Judge  Frankish)  in  the  following
    terms:

         "2.  The application for permission  to  appeal  asserts  erroneous
             balancing exercise primarily based  on  the  two  non  British
             children whose best interests (�53) are conceded to be equally
             well served  in  the  home  country;  non  application  of  EV
             (Philippines) including the cost  of  educational  and  health
             services  for  this  appellant  and  dependants  likewise   MA
             Pakistan -v- SSHD (2-16) EWCA Civ 705 at �61.

         3.   Without the children, the appellant had no case (�44).   There
             were no significant obstacles  under  276ADE  to  return  home
             (�50).  Very much applying all the considerations referred  to
             in the application, with the children having been here  for  7
             and 12 years respectively, the FtTJ found for  the  appellant.
             Arguably, with no reference  to  the  cost  of  continuing  to
             educate the children  and  of  sickle-cell  treatment  of  the
             younger child, an error of law has arisen."

    Thus the matter comes before me to decide if the decision  of  the  FtT
    discloses an error of law sufficient to require the decision to be  set
    aside and remade.

Error of Law Submissions

15. Before me Miss Ahmad appeared for the Secretary of State and Ms  Muzira
    for the Appellant.  I heard submissions from both representatives.

16. Ms Ahmad's submissions relied upon the grounds seeking permission.  She
    referred to both EV (Philippines) and MA (Pakistan) and submitted  that
    the FtTJ had failed to conduct a  proper  balancing  exercise  in  this
    appeal.  She acknowledged that the jurisprudence stated that  the  best
    interests of a qualifying child in Section 117B(6) are to be treated as
    a primary consideration but said that, in the instant appeal, the  FtTJ
    had raised those interests to the paramount  consideration.   She  said
    that although the FtTJ had  said  at  [62]  that  he  had  weighed  the
    Appellant's poor immigration  history  and  the  public  importance  in
    maintaining immigration control against the best interests of  the  two
    children, there was no express reference to the wider  public  interest
    considerations of cost to the public purse in providing  education  and
    medical care for them. This should be  factored  into  a  consideration
    when assessing the question of reasonableness of return  to  Kenya.  AE
    (Algeria) v SSHD[2014] EWCA Civ 623.

17. Ms Muzira on behalf of the Appellant did not file a  Rule  24  response
    but relied upon oral submissions.  She said that  the  decision  should
    stand.  The younger child V had  lived  all  her  life  in  the  UK.  V
    suffered from serious medical problems.  Additionally C had entered the
    UK when aged 5 years and was now months away from attaining  adulthood.
    She would be 18 years of age in March 2018.  All of C's  education  had
    taken place in the UK.  She was at a critical point in  her  education,
    because she was almost through her 'A' level course and would be taking
    her 'A' level exams in the summer.

18. At the close of submissions, both representatives indicated that  there
    was no further evidence to call on behalf of either party.  I  reserved
    my decision which I now give with reasons.

Assessment of whether there is an error of law

19. I must first consider whether the  FtT  erred  in  law  such  that  the
    decision must be set aside.  In essence there were  3  main  points  of
    criticism put forward by  Miss  Ahmad  which  when  taken  cumulatively
    resulted, it was said, in  an  improper  balancing  of  the  Article  8
    proportionality exercise.

20. In substance those criticisms amount to saying  that  the  FtTJ  raised
    the" best interests" of C and V to paramount importance. This was  with
    particular reference to the cost to the public purse of  educating  and
    providing health care for them. In support of her argument, Miss  Ahmad
    said the FtTJ had failed to take into account of the approach  set  out
    in AE (Algeria) where the Court of Appeal said this:

         "What  was  required  was  a  structured  approach  with  the  best
         interests of [M] and her sibling as  a  primary  consideration  but
         with careful consideration also of factors pointing the other  way.
         Such factors include but are not limited to the overstaying of  the
         children and their mother and the illegal entry  and  bogus  asylum
         claim of the Appellant father.  The latter is no doubt what the  UT
         had in mind when referring to 'the  need  to  maintain  immigration
         control.'   Moreover  I  do  not  consider   that   it   would   be
         inappropriate for the future cost and duration of  [M's]  treatment
         and care in this country to play a part in the  balancing  exercise
         as matters relating to the  economic  wellbeing  of  this  country,
         given the strains on the public finances."

21. V suffers from sickle cell disease (SCD). She is now 7  years  of  age,
    having been born in the UK and having lived  all  her  life  here.  The
    Respondent's case is that appropriate medical treatment is available to
    her in Kenya and furthermore  the  cost  of  such  treatment  that  she
    requires should not be borne by the British taxpayer. There is no  good
    reason put forward why the Appellant, who is educated to degree  level,
    could not gain employment and provide for her daughters. Self-evidently
    this would lessen the financial burden on the UK.

22. The difficulty is that what the  FtTJ  had  before  him  was  competing
    evidence concerning V's prospects in relation to her medical  condition
    of sickle cell disease. He noted that the Respondent placed reliance on
    a MedCOI  (country  of  origin  information)  report,  referred  to  at
    paragraph 117 of the Reasons for  Refusal  letter.   This  detailed  in
    general terms that the following medical  treatment  is  available  for
    sickle cell anaemia in Kenya:

     . Outpatient medical treatment and follow up by a specialist;
     . Inpatient/clinical treatment by a specialist;
     . Clinical admission in case of sickle cell crises with clinical
       hyperhydration and pain treatment;
     . Safe blood transfusions if necessary;
     . Hydroxycarbamide (Hydroxyurea) to prevent/reduce the number of vaso-
       occlusive crisis (sickle cell crisis).

23. Against that there was the report  dated  7th  December  2016  from  Dr
    Gattens, Consultant Paediatric Haematologist at Addenbrooke's Hospital.
     He provided a r�sum�  of  the  common  complications  of  sickle  cell
    disease and the treatment that is available to reduce the morbidity and
    mortality associated with the condition.  He then gave specific details
    indicating the seriousness of V's condition.  He reported  on  previous
    hospital inpatient admissions for  sickle  cell  crises  and  a  recent
    admission to the paediatric intensive care unit with  a  chest  crisis.
    He commented that without access to  paediatric  intensive  care,  this
    latest episode would have proved fatal.  He provided information  about
    V's current treatment which includes  lifelong  antibiotic  prophylaxis
    with penicillin; folic acid; an  immunisation  schedule;  an  education
    programme; and annual transcranial Doppler scans up to the  age  of  16
    years.

24. Dr Gattens strongly supported V's application to remain in the UK.   He
    expressed  grave  concerns  about  the  availability  of  the  required
    comprehensive level of treatment in Kenya for a child in V's particular
    circumstances.  He stated that, "...we do not believe  that  she  would
    receive adequate care and medical support in Kenya." He further  stated
    that, "Kenya is a country with limited resources available for  medical
    interventions  and  research  into  sickle  cell  disease.   ....   the
    expectation is that 50 - 80% of children born with sickle cell  anaemia
    will die before they reach the age of 5.  Children with  SCD  in  Kenya
    are at high risk of invasive bacterial infections. 25%  of  those  with
    invasive bacterial infections who present in hospital will die  of  the
    infection. .... In addition to the risk of infection, interventions for
    reduction of stroke risk in higher risk paediatric patients may not  be
    available due to limited care accessibility and the provision of simple
    medications for prophylaxis of infection and blood  count  support  are
    not routinely available."  He supported his conclusions with  reference
    to published medical literature from sources including  King's  College
    and "The Lancet".

25. It is a long held principle that disparity of  medical  treatment  does
    not of itself create an  exceptional  circumstance.   Nevertheless,  in
    this particular case, Dr Gattens deals with the specifics  relating  to
    V's condition.  He says:

         "We are very concerned that if V was to be sent back to Kenya  then
         she will not receive  the  required  medical  care  and  she  could
         potentially have many of  the  complications  of  her  sickle  cell
         disease that have been described above leading her to experience  a
         high level of mortality and an increased risk of morbidity."

26. Thus Dr Gattens clearly concluded that removal  of  V  to  Kenya  would
    seriously affect her health and wellbeing.  It is correct to  say  that
    as far as I can  see  this  report  has  not  been  challenged  by  the
    Respondent.   Without  the  particular  treatment  that  is   routinely
    available in the UK, there was a real risk  to  V  of  increased  pain,
    suffering and morbidity, and a reduction in  life-expectancy.   I  find
    that the FtTJ gave the greatest weight to this evidence over  the  more
    general assertions made in the MedCOI report.  This is reflected in his
    finding at [62] that the best interests of V are served by remaining in
    the UK.  This was a finding open to the FtTJ to make.

27. Naturally the medical treatment that V receives in the UK  comes  at  a
    significant cost to the British taxpayer.  That much is  self  evident.
    I find that the FtTJ has sufficiently shown that he  has  balanced  the
    public interest considerations against the cost to the public purse.

28. Whilst I agree with Miss Ahmad that the FtTJ does not  expressly  refer
    in terms to the cost to the taxpayer of providing public funds for  V's
    education and medical care nevertheless I find it cannot be  said  that
    the judge has failed to keep in mind the relevant factors  underpinning
    the public interest considerations.  Firstly the judge explicitly  sets
    out the statutory requirements of S.117B of 2002 Act [60].  Secondly he
    reminded himself at [57]  that  there  are  numerous  factors  weighing
    towards  the  public  interest  element,  not  least  the   Appellant's
    immigration history. It is self evident that allowing V and C to remain
    with the Appellant in the UK brings a cost to the taxpayer.

29. In short I  find  therefore  that  the  FtTJ  has  shown  that  he  had
    sufficient regard  to  the  public  interest  considerations.  This  is
    apparent from his comments at [62].  It follows therefore that the FtTJ
    recognised that the public interest in removal of the  Appellant  could
    yield in the face of the best interests of C  and  V,  should  that  be
    appropriate. The FtTJ deemed it appropriate, and I find that  to  be  a
    sustainable finding in the light of the medical evidence concerning V.

30. This case essentially was a fact-based  assessment  for  the  judge  to
    make.  No doubt it was a difficult case to decide.   Both  parties  put
    forward strong reasons supporting their case.  It is  also  correct  to
    say that a different Tribunal may have reached a different  conclusion.
    However so far as this matter is concerned it has not been argued  that
    the judge's findings are in some way perverse.   I  conclude  therefore
    that the findings were  ones  which  were  open  to  him.   It  follows
    therefore that, as it has always been accepted that the V and C  should
    remain with their mother who is their sole carer,  then  the  Appellant
    succeeds in her appeal under S.6 Human Rights Act.

31. For the foregoing reasons the appeal  of  the  Secretary  of  State  is
    dismissed and the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  allowing  the
    Appellant's appeal under S.6 Human Rights Act 1998 stands.

Notice of Decision

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  allowing  Ms  C.A.O.'s  appeal

    State is dismissed.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify her  or  any  member  of  her  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
