                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


For the Appellant:     Ms K Evans
                    Home Office Presenting Officer


For the Respondent:    In person


The Secretary of State appeals with permission against the determination  of
an Adjudicator, Mr  R  R  Billingham,  who  allowed  the  claimant's  appeal
against the Secretary of State's refusal to recognise him as a refugee,  and
the setting of removal directions to  Afghanistan.   It  was  common  ground
that the claimant is a credible witness.

Permission to appeal was granted on the basis that  the  Taliban,  the  only
claimed agent of  persecution,  had  been  overthrown  and  replaced  by  an
interim Government committed to the implementation of democracy.    Further,
the  Secretary  of  State  contends  that  the  Adjudicator's   finding   of
continuing risk to those who opposed the Taliban is at  variance  both  with
the claimant's evidence and the objective  evidence.   The  Adjudicator  had
failed to establish from whom the claimant now feared persecution,  nor  who
were the new players in Afghan politics who posed a risk to the claimant  on
return.  There was no evidence of past persecution by non-state agents,  and
the Adjudicator had failed to consider internal relocation.

The core facts are that this claimant with some friends  left  the  Harakate
Muslim group (which opposed the Russians) and in 1992 formed a  small  group
called Hamtaseh of which the principal activity was to set up a  library  of
books  and  political  documents  to  disseminate  ideas  of  freedom,  with
particular emphasis on  women's  rights,  operating  in  Kabul.   The  group
attacked and managed to destroy a tank belonging  to  General  Masood,  then
went underground.  The claimant went into  hiding  to  try  to  conceal  his
identity, but was picked up and beaten badly  on  the  head  and  hands  (in
1999, by the Taliban).  He was released thanks to  the  good  offices  of  a
friend of his, a Pashtun.  From 1999 until coming to the United  Kingdom  in
2000, the claimant kept a low profile, working as a tailor and carrying  out
his political activities in secret.  The  claimant  considers  that  he  has
evidence of corrupt behaviour by a member of the ruling Council,  often  the
same people who ruled under the Taliban.

the Adjudicator's core findings of credibility and fact appear at  paragraph
12 of the determination -

      "12.  On the issue of persecution and ill-treatment I find  that  save
      for one arrest by the Taliban when he was ill-treated,  the  appellant
      has not shown that he had a serious programme of  persecution  in  his
      past.  This is said against a background where, despite his  political
      activity, which I consider  he  has  shown  to  be  credible,  he  has
      survived  remarkably  well  in  the  harshest  of  situations  by  the
      application of his intelligence and skill.   This does not mean in  my
      consideration that he would be exempt from persecution if he  were  to
      be returned.  Although one  approaches  documents  with  some  unease,
      there seems to be  evidence  that  the  appellant  was  known  to  the
      Harakate for his anti-doctrinal stance which I feel sure would get him
      into trouble of some severity were he to be returned bearing  in  mind
      the direction in which the Afghan state seems  to  be  going.   It  is
      difficult to say that he would be persecuted by the state since it  is
      hard in Afghanistan to say what is the State.    Mr Karzai  represents
      according to the West a modernising force  which  the  claimant  might
      well favour but there is little evidence to suggest that  these  ideas
      are widely held in this conservative Muslim  country.   The  appellant
      came across as naï¿½ve but  convinced  that  his  politics  were  sound.
      Despite the apparent absence of the Taliban, however, it would be true
      to say that many of the players in Afghan politics hold  views  hardly
      dissimilar to those of the Taliban and therefore remain  a  danger  to
      the appellant.

      12.1  I found that the appellant has put together a good case  on  his
      own behalf, argued with more passion than  many  advocates.   I  found
      that for the most part he was credible and hones, and despite him  not
      showing that he had been persecuted in the past, I am  satisfied  that
      with the energy of his political  beliefs  having  been  displayed  in
      Afghanistan he would put himself in danger on  return  to  the  extent
      that he has demonstrated a well-founded fear of persecution."

The Adjudicator ruled out state persecution, and  did  consider  sufficiency
of protection (paragraphs16-17).  However, he considered  that  the  general
sufficiency of protection available in  Afghanistan  was  not  open  to  the
claimant on the specific facts of the appeal.  He did not  explain  why  not
(paragraph 17).  The conclusions on  Article  3  are  similarly  unreasoned.
However, as the claimant is a credible witness and the factual findings  are
clear, the Tribunal proceeded to determine the appeal again on the basis  of
those findings and the submissions made to us at the hearing.

For the Secretary of State, Ms  Evans  accepted  that  the  claimant  was  a
credible witness.  However, she argued that  the  Adjudicator's  conclusions
did not follow from his reasoning in  paragraph  12;  the  Taliban  were  no
longer in power.  She accepted that  if  the  claimant  were  at  risk,  the
question of internal relocation did not arise as  he  originally  came  from
Kabul.  He was Muslim, and anti-communist.  He had liberal ideas  which  had
led him to leave Harakate and form Hamtaseh.  There  was  no  evidence  that
Harakate or the state were looking for  him.   She  asked  the  Tribunal  to
allow the Secretary of State's appeal.

The claimant represented  himself.   He  told  the  Tribunal  that  Hamtaseh
originally consisted of only 15 people, who lived and worked in  Kabul.   He
was in touch with Hamtaseh; its main activities were working  for  political
education, and trying to distribute what  had  been  achieved  through  hard
work.  Hamtaseh was based upon one idea; that life belonged not just  to  an
individual, but to society, for whom it should be kept  safe.   The  founder
had a problem under the Taliban and so had others, but they were  no  longer
in Afghanistan.  The claimant himself had been leader of  the  group  for  a
time. Even under the Taliban, most of the members were safe.

The party operated 95% underground and the rest  of  the  party  were  still
working underground in Kabul.  There were now a maximum of 10  members,  but
more people working with them.  Most of the members  were  safe,  and  there
was no serious  persecution.   The  Hamtaseh  members  in  Kabul  were  safe
because they were underground and unknown.  If recognised, they would be  in
danger.

The claimant's wish was to reform Afghanistan not just  politically  but  to
reform the Muslim religion, inside and outside Afghanistan.  No one had  the
heart to speak of reforming religion in Afghanistan.  The claimant  was  now
the leader of Hamtaseh outside Afghanistan, and since coming to  the  United
Kingdom, he had taken a more international approach to  the  Hamtaseh  idea.
He had been in touch with an inter-religious  and  international  group  for
peace (the Unification Church of the Rev Dr Sun Myung Moon, sometimes  known
as 'the Moonies").  He had been invited by them to join, but was not  yet  a
member of the Unification Church.

He had also been helping to ease ethnic tensions in the Afghan  diaspora  in
Birmingham,  working  with  the  Afghan  Youth   and   Family   Association,
campaigning for order in Afghan society, and explaining his new  multi-faith
and multi-cultural approach to Islam.    The  group  had  been  very  active
since 9/11 in the Afghan community in Birmingham, and had  been  founded  by
the claimant and another former Hamtaseh member.  It had  big  meetings  and
was in contact with the Secretary of State.

In reply, Ms Evans indicated that the  issue  of  changing  the  fundamental
nature of Islam was a new idea in this context.   She  was  aware  that  the
claimant had entered into his new life in  Afghanistan  with  his  customary
vigour; he was doing good work with the Afghan Youth and Family  association
in Birmingham.

The Tribunal reserved its determination for postal delivery,  which  we  now
give.  We do not consider that the Adjudicator erred in  not  spending  more
time on internal relocation,  since  realistically  internal  relocation  in
Afghanistan is to Kabul, and this group is already Kabul-based.

We accept that this claimant is a  well-intentioned  and  truthful  witness,
who was a founder member  of  a  small  group  in  Kabul  providing  library
facilities and campaigning (quietly) for human  rights,  especially  women's
rights.  We accept that he has continued to do good works in Birmingham  and
believes passionately in his political aims, which appear to  be  undergoing
some evolution since his arrival in  the  United  Kingdom  four  years  ago.
Although we approach the benefits (for Hamtaseh) of possible alignment  with
the Moonies with a degree of caution, we accept that he is  sincere  in  his
view of this as a possible way of expanding Hamtaseh's remit worldwide.

There is some difficulty in the Adjudicator's reasoning  at  paragraphs  12,
16, and 17 but we do have subjective and objective evidence of the  risk  to
other group members from the claimant himself.

The risk to members of Hamtaseh was low under the  Taliban  and  has  fallen
further; even on his own evidence,  the  rest  of  his  group  in  Kabul  is
currently safe and the risk on return for  the  claimant  accordingly  falls
below the standard required to engage either the Geneva  Convention  on  the
Status of Refugees and Stateless Persons 1951  and  its  protocols  and  the
European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms 1950.

The Secretary of State's appeal is allowed.
