Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    On 2 February 2018  the  Secretary  of  State  refused  to  grant  the
claimant international protection. The claimant appealed to  the  First-tier
Tribunal (the tribunal) but in a decision which it wrote on  19  March  2018
and sent to the parties on 21 March 2018 and which followed a hearing  which
it held on 15 March  2018,  it  dismissed  her  appeal.  She  then  obtained
permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal and, on 10 January  2019,  I  set
aside the tribunal's decision  and  directed  that  the  decision  would  be
remade by the Upper Tribunal after a  further  hearing.  That  hearing  took
place on 1 March 2019 and what follows is my explanation as to  how  I  have
remade the decision and why I have done so in the terms that I have.

2.    The claimant was born on 1 January 1983 and is a national  of  Iraq.
Her husband, a man whom I shall simply refer to as A, was born in  Iraq  but
is a naturalised British  Citizen.   The  couple  have  two  children.   The
eldest was born on 5 March 2013 and the youngest on 14 February 2015.  Both
of those children are, it is accepted, British citizens  in  consequence  of
the nationality of A.

3.    A became a British citizen  on  31 July 2008.  The  claimant  and  A
married each other in Iraq on 28 December 2009.   After  the  marriage,  A
tended to spend part of his time in Iraq and part of his  time  in  the  UK.
The children, though, remained in Iraq with the claimant. On a date in  2016
an application for entry clearance was made on behalf of the two  children.
The applications were not decided and no explanation as to why not has  ever
been offered. But it seems quite likely that, in fact, the  claimant  and  A
had not appreciated  at  the  time  the  applications  were  made  that  the
children are British. It seems  equally  likely  that  the  entry clearance
officer who dealt with the applications had realised they are  and  so  took
the view,  quite  correctly  it  seems  to  me,  that  no  decision  on  the
entry clearance application was appropriate or required.

4.    The claimant, whilst in Iraq, found herself unable to  make  an  entry
clearance application which would have a viable prospect  of  success.  That
was, so far as I can see, for at least two reasons. Firstly,  she  does  not
speak English. Secondly, A has not been in a position to earn sufficient  to
reach the minimum income threshold for a couple of ï¿½18,600.  So,  compliance
with the requirements of the Immigration Rules concerning  spouses  was  not
possible. But the claimant  left  Iraq  on  31 August 2017  and  travelled
through various European countries until entering the UK, in  a  clandestine
manner, on 12 September 2017. I am told she brought the children with  her
though it seems surprising  she  would  take  them  on  such  a  potentially
difficult and demanding journey when it might have been possible,  depending
upon the stance taken by airlines with respect to unaccompanied  minors,  to
have them come to the UK legitimately by air. But,  nevertheless,  I  accept
that that is what  she  did.  It  is  recorded  that  she  formally  claimed
entitlement to international protection in the UK on 10 October 2017. In so
doing, she asserted that she was at risk of being the victim  of  an  honour
killing at the hands of  her  family  because  "a  strange  male",  who  had
attended her house to drop off some medication for  her  daughter  had  been
spotted by those family members and they had  drawn  inaccurate  conclusions
as to her morality.

5.    It is fair to say that both the Secretary of  State  and,  on  appeal,
the tribunal found the claimant's account of events  said  to  underpin  her
claim to be entitled to  international  protection  to  be  untruthful.  The
tribunal explained why it did not believe her  in  a  passage  running  from
paragraph 33 to  paragraph 43  of  its  written  reasons.  The  tribunal's
findings as to that were not subsequently challenged.  So,  despite  setting
aside its decision I decided  to  preserve  the  findings  contained  within
those paragraphs. I need not set them out but it is fair to say the  adverse
credibility findings were utterly destructive of her claim  to  be  entitled
to international protection.

6.    Moving on from the preserved part of the tribunal's decision, it  then
went on to ask itself whether the claimant might succeed  on  the  basis  of
Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR)  either  within
or outside  the  Immigration  Rules.   As  a  part  of  that  assessment  it
considered whether there would be "very significant obstacles" faced by  the
claimant or A in pursuing a life together in Iraq.  It concluded that  there
would not be any such obstacles and it explained why it took that view in  a
passage from paragraph 44 to 47 of its written reasons.  The tribunal  then
turned its attention to other Article 8 considerations and, in  particular,
those concerning the situation of  the  two  British  Citizen  children.  It
concluded that in all the circumstances, and notwithstanding the  fact  that
they are British, it would be reasonable to expect them  to  leave  the  UK.
That had the consequence of  leading  the  tribunal  to  conclude  that  the
claimant could not succeed on Article 8 grounds either  within  or  outside
the Immigration Rules.  The tribunal did not, though, consider the  possible
relevance of a Home Office policy or internal instruction apparently  known
as "Immigration Directorate Instructions:  Family Migration:   Appendix FM,
Section 1.0(B) Family Life as a Partner or Parent and Private Life, 10 year
Routes". That is a policy or  instrument  of  guidance  which,  it  appears,
seeks to ensure that the UK complies with the obligations which it has as  a
consequence of the decision of the European Court of Justice  in  the  well-
known case of Zambrano [2011] EUECJ C-34/09. Having  heard  argument  as  to
that and in the face of what amounted to  a  concession  on  behalf  of  the
Secretary of State I concluded that the tribunal had  erred  in  failing  to
consider the policy, the detail of which had been  set  before  it,  on  the
basis that any possible compliance with the terms of  such  a  policy  might
have  been  relevant  to  the  global  article  8  assessment  outside   the
Immigration Rules and might have made a difference.

7.    At the hearing of 1 March 2019 I had  the  paperwork  which  had  been
before the tribunal supplemented by a short additional witness statement  of
the claimant and a short additional witness statement from A. I  heard  oral
evidence  from  each  of  them  and  then   heard   submissions   from   the
representatives to whom I am  grateful.  I  have  taken  all  of  that  into
account.

8.    The claimant said that she had told the truth  about  events  in  Iraq
which had led  to  her  fleeing  that  country  and  claiming  international
protection. She suffers from asthma. She did not have  that  condition  when
she was living in Iraq. She thought if she were to leave her  family  behind
and return to Iraq A would not be able to look after  the  children  because
"no one can replace a  mother's  position"  and  because  the  children  are
closer to her than they are to A. A said that he would  be  unable  to  look
after the children in the way the claimant does.

9.    In urging me to remake  the  decision  Mr  Greer  simply  relied  upon
section 117B(6) of the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002  and
asserted  that  the  appeal  must  succeed  under  article  8  outside   the
Immigration  Rules  because  the  claimant  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting
parental relationship  with  the  children,  the  children  are  "qualifying
children" because they are British,  and  it  would  not  be  reasonable  to
expect them to leave the UK. That was a legitimate route  for  Mr  Greer  to
take because although I had set aside the tribunal's decision on  the  basis
of a different argument relating to article  8,  I  had  not  preserved  the
tribunal's conclusion that it would be reasonable to expect them  to  leave.
Mrs Pettersen relied upon what she said was the  dishonest  conduct  of  the
claimant and the fact that both the children were in  the  early  stages  of
education such that a move to  a  different  country  would  not  be  overly
disruptive.

10.   In deciding this appeal I have had followed, as I must, what was  said
in KO (Nigeria) v SSHD [2018] UKSC 53. I have also had regard  to  what  was
said and decided by the Upper  Tribunal  in  JG  Turkey  [2019]  UKUT  00072
(IAC).

11.   It is made clear by the  Supreme  Court  in  KO  that  in  considering
whether it would be reasonable to expect a qualifying  child  to  leave  the
UK, regard is not to be  had  to  the  misconduct  of  the  parents.  In  my
judgment there has, here, been misconduct which,  but  for  KO,  would  have
been  relevant  to  the  reasonableness  question.  The  claimant  has,   on
preserved findings, manufactured a claim to  be  entitled  to  international
protection.  She  has  done  so  because  she  wishes  to   circumvent   the
requirements of the Immigration Rules which she cannot meet.  She  has  then
persisted  in  that  dishonesty  in  her  evidence  before  me.  Mr   Greer,
realistically, did not seek to persuade me that she  had  been  honest  when
making her claim. He suggested, effectively, that  she  was  an  immigration
offender but a routine one rather  than  a  particularly  or  especially  or
unusually culpable one. I see the point in the sense that  she  is  not  the
first person to come to the UK and seek to mislead to so as  to  be  granted
international protection. But she has done so, I find, as a  cynical  device
in circumstances where others who  similarly  cannot  meet  the  Rules  have
waited until they can before making a lawful and appropriate application.  I
expect that A had  full  knowledge  of  her  dishonesty  too.  It  would  be
surprising if she had hidden it from  him.  So,  if  it  were  not  for  the
children, the claimant's article 8 arguments would be hopeless.

12.   But KO as I say makes it clear that parental conduct is  not  relevant
to a reasonableness assessment. It also makes it clear, if it  were  not  so
before, that satisfaction of the reasonableness test is determinative  under
article 8 outside the Immigration Rules even if that  means  Parliament  has
chosen to legislate in a way which makes the  position  more  favourable  to
some claimants than article 8 itself strictly requires. JG  makes  it  clear
that the reasonableness test requires decision makers to hypothesise that  a
child will actually leave the UK even  in  circumstances  where  that  would
probably not happen.

13.   Applying the above, if the claimant has to leave the UK she  will,  of
course, go back to Iraq.  I must assume, following JG that the two  children
will go with her. But I do not think that A will do so. I say  that  because
he did not live in Iraq, though  he  clearly  spent  time  there,  when  the
claimant and the children were all in Iraq. It cannot benefit  the  children
to be separated, even allowing  for  possibly  lengthy  visits,  from  their
father.  Nor, speaking generally, is it likely to benefit them  to  have  to
go to a country which has suffered considerable instability and upheaval  in
the very recent past. or to leave one which is stable. As  to  that,  it  is
clear that the claimant and A, who  both  by  now  have  had  experience  of
living in both countries, prefer the  UK.  So,  I  am  able  to  comfortably
conclude that it would not be reasonable to expect  either  child  to  leave
the UK. It follows from the above that the claimant succeeds  under  article
8 outside the Immigration Rules.

Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error  of
law and has been set aside. In remaking the decision in the Upper  Tribunal,
I allow the claimant's appeal against the Secretary of State's  decision  of
2 February 2018 on human rights grounds under article 8 of the ECHR  outside
the Immigration Rules.
