                            DECISION AND REASONS

1     This is an appeal against the decision  of  Judge  of  the  First-tier
      Tribunal Alty, dated 31 January 2017, in which the Judge had dismissed
      the Appellant's appeal against the Respondent's decision of  11  April
      2016 refusing the Appellant a card confirming  a  permanent  right  of
      residence under Regs 15(1)(b) and 18(2) of the  Immigration  (European
      Economic Area) Regulations 2006.

2     The Appellant had applied for such a residence card on  the  basis  of
      his marriage to his EEA national  spouse  Ms  Katarzyna  Helena  Dione
      ('the Sponsor'), a Polish national. The Sponsor had  been  present  in
      United Kingdom prior to Appellant, and there is evidence that she  had
      been economically active from 2008 onwards.  I  return  to  the  exact
      nature of that evidence below.

3     The Appellant entered  the  United  Kingdom  on  1  December  2009  in
      possession of an EEA family permit granted to him for the purposes  of
      joining the Sponsor in the UK as her non-EEA national  spouse.  It  is
      clear then that the Appellant has resided in  the  United  Kingdom  in
      accordance with the 2006 regulations from that date, 1 December 2009.

4     In or around 2013, the couple  separated,  but  have  never  divorced.
      They are therefore still to be treated as spouses for the purposes  of
      EEA law.

5     In or around October 2015 the Appellant  made  an  application  for  a
      card confirming a right of permanent residence  but  that  application
      was refused by the Respondent on 11 April 2016 on the basis  that  the
      Appellant had not provided sufficient evidence with his application of
      the Sponsor's economic activity for a continuous period of five years.
       The Appellant appealed.

6     The matter came before the Judge on 16 January 2017.  The  Judge  held
      that there was evidence before her of economic activity of the Sponsor
      up to August 2013 (paragraph 25).  However, she was  not  prepared  to
      consider any evidence relating  to  the  Sponsor's  economic  activity
      prior to 1 December 2009,  being  the  date  on  which  the  Appellant
      arrived in United Kingdom. The Judge held that the relevant  five-year
      period for  the  Appellant  to  demonstrate  his  right  of  permanent
      residence could only start from 1 December 2009 onwards, and that  the
      Sponsor needed  to  demonstrate  economic  activity  from  that  point
      onwards. However, no reliable  evidence  existed  post  dating  August
      2013. For those reasons, the Judge dismissed the appeal.

7     In an application for permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  the
      Appellant argues that: "There was no continuous  obligation  to  start
      exercising treaty rights for another five years  before  any  relative
      can be granted resident  status".

8     In a decision granting permission to appeal dated 25  September  2017,
      Upper Tribunal Judge Kebede observed as follows:

           "There is arguable merit in the assertion in  the  grounds  that
           the relevant five-year period stated  in  regulation  15  (1)(b)
           included residence with the EEA national after  her  acquisition
           of  permanent  residence  and  the  Judge  arguably   erred   in
           concluding otherwise at para 25."

9     In a Rule 24 response from  the  Respondent  dated  11  October  2017,
      prepared by David Clarke,  Specialist  Appeals  Team,  the  Respondent
      stated as follows:

           "2. It is submitted that the Appellant applied for  a  permanent
           residence card having entered the UK on  1  December  2009.  The
           issue raised in the refusal letter was that the Appellant failed
           to evidence that the Sponsor had  exercised  treaty  rights  for
           five years. As noted by the FTTJ at paragraph 20  the  Appellant
           and Sponsor whilst separated were still married.  Therefore  the
           issue fell to be decided under regulations 15(1)(b) and 7.

           3. It is accepted that once the  Sponsor  obtained  a  permanent
           right of residence, provided she was not absent from the UK  for
           two years, she would no longer need to demonstrate that she  was
           a worker. The FTTJ was clearly  in  error  at  paragraph  25  in
           failing to take into account the period prior to the Appellant's
           entry into the UK in assessing whether the Sponsor had  acquired
           permanent residence.

           4 . The Respondent therefore concedes that the issue of  whether
           the Sponsor acquired permanent residence or subsequently lost it
           through absence are live issues that remain to be determined."

10    At the commencement of the hearing, I drew to  the  attention  of  the
      parties the reported case of PM  (EEA  -  spouse  -  'residing  with')
      Turkey [2011] UKUT 89 (IAC), the head note of which is as follows:

           "Regulation 15(1)(b) of the Immigration (European Economic Area)
           Regulations 2006 applies to those who entered a genuine marriage
           where both parties have resided in the United Kingdom  for  five
           years since the marriage; the EEA national's spouse has  resided
           as the family member of  a  qualified  person  or  otherwise  in
           accordance with the Regulations and the marriage  has  not  been
           dissolved. The "residing with" requirement relates  to  presence
           in the UK; it does not require living in a common family home."

11    In discussion, the parties agreed with me that the Judge had erred  in
      law. It would be possible for the Sponsor in the present case to  have
      gained a right of a permanent  residence  after  five  years  economic
      activity. That period of economic activity need not coincide with  the
      Appellant's presence in the United Kingdom. In the present  case,  the
      Judge had found that the last evidence that existed  for  the  Sponsor
      having been economically active in the United Kingdom was August 2013.
      If, therefore, the Appellant could demonstrate that  the  Sponsor  had
      been economically active from August 2008 to August 2013, it would  be
      established that the Sponsor would have a right of permanent residence
      from August  2013  onwards.  She  could  accurately  be  described  as
      residing in United Kingdom 'in accordance with' the  2006  regulations
      both during the five-year period of qualification to gain a  permanent
      right of residence, and afterwards. The whole of her  residence  would
      be in accordance with the 2006 regulations. There is no evidence  that
      she has been absent from United for two or more years.

12    PM establishes  that  so  long  as  the  Appellant  has  resided  with
      (meaning being present in United Kingdom, not necessarily living in  a
      common family home with the Sponsor) for a period of five years,  then
      he will have gained a right of permanent residence himself.

13    There was some dispute as to what evidence  was  actually  before  the
      First tier Judge regarding the economic activity of  the  Sponsor.  Mr
      Chopra for the Appellant asserted that in addition  to  a  substantial
      bundle  of  documents  which  had  been  filed  with  the  First-tier,
      additional evidence comprising a number of P60 forms,  from  the  year
      ending 5 April 2009, to the year ending 5 April 2013,  had  also  been
      filed with the First-tier under cover of  a  letter  dated  9  January
      2017.  On the court file, I could find such a covering letter, but not
      the evidence referred to within it. For his part,  Mr  Harisson  could
      find neither the letter nor the evidence.  There  remains  some  doubt
      therefore whether this P60 documentation was actually before the First
      tier.

14    However, the Appellant's representatives have  filed  with  the  Upper
      Tribunal an additional bundle of documents under cover of  20  October
      2017.

15     I  pause  at  this  point  and  make  the   following   observations.
      Unfortunately, Mr Chopra and a colleague who sat next  to  him  during
      the hearing were themselves very confused about this  bundle.  At  one
      stage they appeared not have it  themselves,  notwithstanding  that  a
      copy had been filed with the Tribunal  and  the  Respondent  by  their
      firm. Neither appeared to be familiar with the  contents  of  it  even
      once it was confirmed that it was in fact in  their  possession.  They
      stated that it had been prepared by a colleague of theirs Mr Lawson.

16    When I asked them to perform the relatively  straightforward  task  of
      identifying for the Tribunal what financial evidence contained  within
      that bundle the Appellant actually relied upon, they were able  to  do
      so for some considerable period of time during the hearing,  and  were
      only able to do so after the  matter  had  been  stood  down  for  the
      luncheon adjournment.  At  my  direction  a  handwritten  schedule  of
      references within the bundle was prepared and filed  when  the  matter
      resumed at 2 pm.

17    Upon the matter resuming, the Appellant representatives were  able  to
      identify the P60 documents referred to above, at pages 3T, 3U, 3V, and
      3W of the new bundle.  For the avoidance of doubt, I  confirm  that  I
      permitted this material to be submitted to  the  Tribunal  under  rule
      15(2A) of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.  It  was
      clear that the Appellant had intended to provide that evidence to  the
      First tier, and there  was  no  objection  from  Mr  Harrison  on  the
      Appellant now relying upon this evidence for the purposes of  remaking
      the decision in this matter.

18    There were also contained within the bundle a series of payslips,  the
      most relevant of which were dated 30 January 2009, 28  February  2009,
      and 30 March 2009.

19    There are two P60's for the period ending 5 April 2009;  one  from  an
      employer, Joanna Teresa Brookes,  ILF  Accounts,  providing  that  the
      Sponsor had earned �1,818 in the tax year ending April 2009 (page 3T),
      and a further P60 from an employer Tracy Lindsay confirming  that  the
      Sponsor had earned �13,409.55 during the tax year ending 5 April 2009.



20    Those P60's, considered alongside the payslips from January  to  March
      2009, establish that the Sponsor had earned some �15,200 at some point
      during the tax year ending April 2009. However, it was not possible to
      confirm precisely what period within the tax year April 08 - April  09
      those sums had been earned.  However,  based  on  the  fact  that  the
      Sponsor was a care worker earning relatively modest sums week to week,
      Mr Harrison, for the Respondent was prepared to  accept  that  it  was
      more likely than not that the �15,200 earned in the tax year April 08-
      April 09 was likely to have been earned from August  08,  or  earlier,
      running up to April 09. I agree that that was a sensible concession to
      make in the circumstances.

21    I am therefore able to remake the decision in this matter as  follows.



22    I find that the Sponsor was economically active as a qualified  person
      from at least August 2008. The Judge had previously accepted that  the
      Sponsor had continued to be economically active up until August  2013.
      On the basis of my finding, with the retained finding of the Judge,  I
      find that the Sponsor obtained a permanent right residence from August
      2013 onwards.

23    As recorded above, it is perfectly possible to  describe  the  Sponsor
      as  living  in  the  United  Kingdom  in  accordance  with  the   2006
      regulations not only during the five years from August 2008 to  August
      2013, but also from  August 2013 onwards, residing in the  UK  with  a
      right of permanent residence in accordance with the 2006 regulations.

24    Therefore, with the Appellant being married to  the  Sponsor,  and  he
      himself being present in United Kingdom from 1 December 2009  onwards,
      it can be held that  the  Appellant  obtained  a  right  of  permanent
      residence from 1 December 2014 onwards.

25    However, Mr Harrison pointed out that  the  Appellant  had  originally
      been issued with a residence card on 20 July 2010 valid until 20  July
      2015, and queried whether the Appellant could have gained a  right  of
      permanent residence prior to 20 July 2015.  However,  that  card  will
      have been issued in the  light  of  certain  evidence  that  had  been
      submitted with that particular application. Further, it is to be noted
      that initial 5 years residence cards issued under Reg 17 of  the  2006
      Regulations are not backdated by the Respondent, even if  evidence  is
      provided of economic activity by the qualified person going back  some
      time prior to the application.

26    However, an application under Reg 18 of the  2006  Regulations  for  a
      card confirming a permanent right of residence might be  supported  by
      different evidence than the initial application,  and  the  Respondent
      must necessarily consider  that  evidence  going  backwards  from  the
      present time. Mr Harrison had accepted in the present case that it was
      more likely than not that the evidence in the appeal established  that
      the Sponsor had been economically active in the UK  from  August  2008
      onwards.

27    Thus, I conform that I am satisfied that the Appellant gained a  right
      of permanent residence from 1 December 2014.

28    I consider as an aside only an argument which was advanced  to  me  by
      Mr Chopra on behalf the Appellant today, although not  argued  in  the
      First tier below. This  was  that  the  child  of  the  Appellant  and
      Sponsor, born in the United Kingdom on 25 April 2010,  had  a  British
      passport issued to him on 15 March 2012. It was argued that  in  order
      for this child to be recognised as a British  citizen,  he  must  have
      been British at birth, or by registration thereafter,  and  in  either
      case, on the basis that the child's mother, the Sponsor, must have had
      a permanent right residence either when the child was  born,  or  some
      later time. Therefore, it was argued that by  15  March  2012  at  the
      latest (when the passport was issued), the Sponsor  must  have  had  a
      permanent right residence, and that this will have been established by
      financial documentation that had been  provided  to  the  UK  Passport
      Office when applying for a passport for the child.

29    I do not take  this  argument  into  account  in  determining  present
      appeal. Although it is possible that  the  Appellant's  son  may  have
      gained British citizenship by reason of  the  Sponsor  persuading  the
      Passport Office that she had right of permanent residence,  there  may
      have been other reasons why the child had been recognised as a British
      citizen.

30    For reasons I have outlined above, I find that  the  Appellant  has  a
      right of residence from 1 December 2014 onwards, and  is  entitled  to
      have his appeal allowed.

      Decision

      The making of the decision by the  Judge  involved  the  making  of  a
      material error of law.

      I set aside the Judge's decision.

      I remake the decision, allowing the Appellant's appeal under  the  EEA
      Regulations 2006.
