Representation
For the Appellant:     Mr D Clarke, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms M Malhotra, counsel, instructed by Ash Norton
Solicitors

                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. I shall refer to the appellant as "the secretary of state" and to  the
      respondent as "the claimant."

   2. The secretary of state appeals  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge Coll promulgated  on  25  November  2016  allowing  the
      claimant's appeal against the decision of the secretary  of  state  to
      refuse to vary her  leave  to  remain  following  an  application  for
      further leave to remain as a Tier 4 (General) Student migrant.

   3. On 5 June 2017 First-tier Tribunal Judge Osborne granted the secretary
      of state permission to appeal on the basis that it  is  arguable  that
      the Judge failed to consider the witness statement of Professor French
      who considered the defects in the secretary of state's case that  were
      found to exist in the Upper Tribunal's decision in SM and Qadir v SSHD
      (ETS - Evidence - Burden of Proof) [2016] UKUT 229  (IAC).  The  Judge
      also failed to take into account the widespread cheating at  Queensway
      College.

        The decision of the First-tier Tribunal

   4. In her decision, Judge Coll set  out  the  evidence  relating  to  the
      invalidation of the claimant's test results. She directed  herself  in
      accordance with R (on the application of Gazi v SSHD (ETS  -  judicial
      review IJR [2015] UKUT 00327 as well as setting out  the  headnote  of
      the decision of the Upper Tribunal in SM  and  Qadir  v  SSHD  (ETS  -
      Evidence - Burden of Proof) [2016] UKUT 229 (IAC) at [34].

   5. She noted that in the claimant's case, the secretary of  state  relied
      upon the same two witnesses from the Home  Office  as  in  Qadir.  The
      additional report by an expert linguist "...is not particular  to  the
      (claimant's) situation and therefore adds nothing" [36]. The  evidence
      from the claimant shows that she is a person of good character who had
      no incentive to cheat.

   6. She found that when the  secretary  of  state  made  the  decision  to
      refuse, "....the (claimant's) TOEIC results had been subjected to  the
      same very flawed process criticised by the UT". She accordingly  found
      that the legal burden of proof had not been discharged. The appeal was
      accordingly allowed under the Immigration Rules - [37] and [38].

      The appeal

   7. Mr Clarke relied on the reasons for appealing, noting that  the  Judge
      accepted that the claimant attended Queensway  College  and  took  the
      test herself. It is not clear how giving a detailed description of how
      the college was chosen and its location assisted  in  determining  the
      deception issue. This did not preclude the use of a proxy  test  taker
      during the test. There was no analysis as to how  the  appellant  took
      the test or what was involved.

   8. He referred to the fact that the Judge noted  that  the  secretary  of
      state produced no language expert report  to  support  the  contention
      that in the claimant's case, her past and subsequent English  language
      examination and test results were such as to show on  the  balance  of
      probabilities that she did not have the ability and past experience to
      obtain the TOEIC scores honestly.

   9. Mr Clarke submitted that no such expert report was necessary but  that
      was not the contention being made. What was  contended  was  that  the
      claimant practised deception in her TOEIC  test.  Properly  read,  the
      witness statements and the spreadsheet extract showed that her English
      language test had been invalidated because of evidence of fraud in the
      test taken by the claimant.

  10. He submitted that there may be reasons why a person  who  is  able  to
      speak English to the required level would nevertheless cause or permit
      a proxy candidate to  undertake  the  ETS  test  on  their  behalf  or
      otherwise to cheat. He referred to the judgment in MA (Nigeria) [2016]
      UKUT 540 at [57]. There is scope for other explanations for  deceitful
      conduct.

  11. MA (Nigeria) also featured  Queensway  College  as  one  of  the  test
      centres, the very one selected by the claimant.  The  Tribunal  in  MA
      stated that at the general level, there  is  inter  alia  clear  prima
      facie evidence of TOEIC corruption at the two test centres  where  the
      appellant (in that case) claimed to  have  been  examined.  Mr  Clarke
      submitted that the college is the subject of a Project  Fa�ade  report
      because of the widespread cheating there  which  was  not  taken  into
      account by the Judge.

  12. Nor did the Judge properly consider the report  of  Professor  French,
      simply stating that she did not find the additional report "particular
      to the appellant's situation and therefore adds nothing." In contrast,
      the report actually dealt with all the criticisms of ETS testing  made
      by Dr Harrison, which were accepted in SM and Qadir.

  13. Mr Clarke noted that the  Project  Fa�ade  report  was  faxed  to  the
      Tribunal on 3 November 2016. Dr French's report was available as well.
      At paragraph [5] of the decision, the Judge was aware of the report of
      Dr French, which was identified as part of the  secretary  of  state's
      supplementary bundle.

  14. He submitted that ETS case law involves a  fact  sensitive  assessment
      which must be undertaken. The evidence as a whole must be  weighed  up
      in order to determine whether the secretary of  state  has  discharged
      the legal burden. The Judge failed to address the  need  for  innocent
      explanations from the claimant. At [36] she found that the  additional
      report added nothing. He submitted that that characterisation  of  the
      report as "adding nothing" constituted an error. The report  addresses
      various issues raised in Qadir which were not available at  the  time.
      Nor was there any mention of the criminal investigation undertaken  in
      respect of the college regarding the extent of proxy cheating.

  15. On behalf of the  claimant,  Ms  Malhotra  referred  to  the  "French"
      report. She submitted that this was a tentative  report.  It  was  not
      conclusive. All he could do was to differ generally in his  view.  The
      Judge in the event had regard to the report,  stating  that  it  added
      nothing.

  16. As to the report concerning the Queensway College, the Judge  referred
      at [5] to all the evidence before her including  the  print  out,  the
      statement from Ms Shah and the report on Project  Fa�ade  relating  to
      the criminal investigation of  Queensway  College.  It  was  therefore
      clearly in the Judge's mind.

  17. The Judge considered the "innocent explanation" of the  claimant  from
      [15-24]. She had regard to the claimant's witness statement where  she
      set out in full her denial that the certificate had been  fraudulently
      obtained as well as why she wished  to  complete  her  studies  before
      returning to Thailand. The claimant stated that whilst in Bangkok, she
      started her own bakery business; she wanted to expand it  and  improve
      her English. She therefore decided with her family's encouragement  to
      come to the UK to study further. She  completed  her  general  English
      programme in the UK and then returned to Thailand.

  18. Subsequently she applied for leave to enter as a student. She  sent  a
      TOEIC certificate from ETS to the visa office prior  to  returning  to
      Thailand. She wanted  to  further  improve  her  English  and  studied
      English  as  a  foreign  language  from  2013  until  2014  at  Ealing
      Hammersmith and West London College.

  19. Ms Malhotra noted that there was  a  Home  Office  Presenting  Officer
      present. She could have asked the claimant a number  of  questions  as
      anticipated in QM, supra, at [69].

  20. The Judge found  that  the  claimant  was  entirely  credible  in  all
      respects as regards her circumstances. She  answered  questions  in  a
      straightforward manner with no hesitation - [27]

  21. The Judge set out  her  evidence  in  some  detail.  As  part  of  the
      evidence, the Judge has recorded in the proceedings that she was asked
      questions about the location of Queensway College. She  identified  it
      as near the Wandsworth tube station. She also explained that she chose
      Queensway College as the agency recommended this.  She  had  only  two
      weeks to do the exam.

      Assessment

  22. Judge Coll has given a careful decision. She has  had  regard  to  the
      proper approach identified in the authorities which she set  out  from
      [32-36].

  23. She has also had regard to the secretary of state's evidence  produced
      including witness statements and the report which she set out at  [5].
      She also had regard  to  the  Project  Fa�ade  report  in  respect  of
      Queensway College.

  24. The claimant gave evidence asserting her innocence. In finding her  to
      be entirely credible in all aspects of her evidence the Judge set  out
      the background facts relating to her academic achievements at [28-30].
      She found that it would not be inconceivable for  her  to  obtain  the
      test scores set out in the TOEIC certificate - [29]. She noted that in
      October 2014 she achieved an average score of 5.5  in  IELTS  reading,
      writing, speaking and listening. IELTS scores, taken a year after  the
      TOEIC, were sufficiently good that it would not have  been  surprising
      for her to have obtained the scores set out in the  TOEIC  certificate
      [29].

  25. It is in that context that the Judge noted that the secretary of state
      produced  no  language  expert  report  to  support   the   claimant's
      contention that her past and subsequent English  language  examination
      and test results were such as to  show  that  she  did  not  have  the
      ability and past experience to obtain  the  TOEIC  scores  honestly  -
      [29].  That was little more than a makeweight.

  26. In concluding that the secretary of state had not discharged the legal
      burden  that  the  claimant  had  cheated,  Judge  Coll  has  properly
      considered the circumstances as a whole, including taking into account
      the flawed process which had been criticised by the Upper Tribunal.

  27. Those findings were based  upon  the  available  evidence  which  were
      properly reasoned and are sustainable.
