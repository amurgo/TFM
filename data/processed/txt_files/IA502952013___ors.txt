Representation:

For the appellants:    Ms CH Bexson, instructed by Levens Solicitors
For the respondent:    Ms J Isherwood, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants, comprising husband, wife and their three children,  are
    all citizens of Nigeria with respective dates of birth 1.9.77, 15.5.77,
    7.4.05, 29.6.06 and 17.12.12.

 2. This is their appeal against the determination of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge  Brennells   promulgated  7.7.14,  who  dismissed  their  appeals
    against the decisions of the respondent, dated 6.11.13, to refuse their
    applications made on 28.2.13 for leave to remain in the UK outside  the
    Immigration Rules.  The Judge heard the appeal on 26.6.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Andrew  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    24.7.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 11.9.14 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Brenells should be set aside.

 6. The grant  of  permission  to  appeal  erroneously  stated  that  Judge
    Brenells had allowed the appeals. Clearly the appeals  were  dismissed.
    However, Judge Andrew found, "It is arguable that the Judge should have
    considered both Paragraph EX1 and also Paragraph 276ADE(4)  in  respect
    of the older child, submissions in relation to both matters having been
    put to him. I find there is an arguable error of law."

 7. The first appellant came to the UK as a student in 2004  and  thus  has
    been in the UK for some 10 years. Her husband joined her as a dependant
    partner and their three children were born in the UK between  2005  and
    2012. Their last leave expired 2.3.13. The refusal decisions state that
    on 17.10.12 the first appellant  made  an  application  for  indefinite
    leave to remain on the  basis  of  her  child's  residence  in  the  UK
    exceeding 7 years and under Human Rights. It also appears that  another
    application for leave to remain outside the Rules was made on  28.2.13,
    shortly before the expiry of the first appellant's student leave.

 8. The refusal decisions considered both Appendix FM and paragraph 276ADE,
    taking into account section 55 of the UK Borders Act in relation to the
    best interests of the children. However, the first  appellant  did  not
    meet the requirements of Appendix FM in respect of either  her  partner
    or her children. Further, the appellants do not meet  the  requirements
    of paragraph 276ADE in relation to private life, as they have not lived
    continuously in the UK for at least 20 years and they  have  failed  to
    demonstrate that they have no  ties,  including  social,  cultural  and
    family, to their home country of Nigeria.

 9. Judge Brenells considered the appellants' claim under human rights  and
    article 8 ECHR. However, following  Shahzad  (Art  8:  legitimate  aim)
    [2014] UKUT 00085 (IAC), the judge found no arguably good grounds  that
    there are compelling circumstances  insufficiently  recognised  in  the
    Rules so as to justify granting leave to remain outside  the  Rules  on
    the basis that the decision was unjustifiably harsh.

10. At �21 the judge stated that even had  he  considered  a  free-standing
    article 8 EHCR claim, he would have reached the same conclusion because
    the family have only ever been in the UK on a temporary basis and  they
    will be removed together as a family. "There is  no  evidence  to  show
    that the children's welfare would be so affected by  the  family  being
    required  to  leave  the  UK  as  to  render   the   family's   removal
    disproportionate. There is  no  evidence  which  establishes  that  the
    appellants' family ties and  private  life  here  is  such  that  their
    removal would not be a  proportionate  response  permitted  by  Article
    8(2)." The Human Rights appeals were thus dismissed.

11. The grounds of appeal  complain  that  the  judge  failed  to  consider
    paragraph EX1 of Appendix FM  and  failed  to  consider  276ADE(vi)  in
    relation to the private life of the eldest child, who had lived in  the
    UK for at least 7 years and that it would not be reasonable  to  expect
    him to leave the UK.

12. For the reasons set out herein, I find that there is no  merit  in  the
    grounds of appeal and I am surprised that permission to appeal was ever
    granted.

13. In her submissions Ms Bexson failed to understand that  EX1  is  not  a
    free-standing consideration. In Sabir (Appendix  FM  -  EX.1  not  free
    standing) [2014] UKUT 63 (IAC) it was held that the architecture of the
    Rules as regards partners is such  that  EX.1  is  "parasitic"  on  the
    relevant Rule within Appendix FM that otherwise grants leave to remain.

14. Ms Bexson erroneously submitted that EX1 applied because of  a  genuine
    and subsisting parental relationship with their eldest child.  However,
    as the refusal decision pointed out, the first appellant neither  meets
    the requirements of R-LTRP and E-LTRP 1.2, because her partner does not
    have settled status in the UK, nor R-LTRPT and E-LTRPT 2.3 because  she
    does not have sole responsibility for a child who has lived in  the  UK
    for at least 7 years. The first appellant  shares  responsibility  with
    her partner, the second appellant.

15. Thus even if  EX1  had  been  considered,  the  appellants  fail  under
    Appendix FM.

16. In relation to paragraph 276ADE, Ms Bexson was correct to  stated  that
    it had not been considered by the First-tier Tribunal Judge,  but  that
    was because the application was brought outside the  Immigration  Rules
    and it was clear from the refusal decision that the appellants did  not
    meet any of  the  requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules,  including
    paragraph 276ADE.

17. Even if the First-tier Tribunal Judge had considered paragraph  276ADE,
    it is clear that none of the appellants met the requirements.

18. In relation to the eldest child who has been in the UK for in excess of
    7 years, 276ADE(iv) as in force at the date of application and decision
    is that not only must there be a 7 year minimum period, but it must not
    be unreasonable to expect the applicant to leave the UK. In this regard
    Ms Bexson submits that the judge has  given  no  consideration  to  the
    reasonableness assessment and in particular to the  best  interests  of
    that child. She relied on EV (Philippines) & Ors [2014] EWCA  Civ  874,
    where at �35 the Court of Appeal set out some factors for consideration
    of what is in the  best  interests  of  children.  However,  Ms  Bexson
    ignored the conclusion in relation to the appellants in  that  case  at
    �60 where Lord Justice Lewison pointed out that the facts of that  case
    were a long way from ZH (Tanzania). None of the family  was  a  British
    citizen. None had the right to remain in the  UK.  If  the  mother  was
    removed, the father has no independent right to remain. If the  parents
    are removed, "then it is entirely reasonable to expect the children  to
    go with them. As the immigration judge found it is obviously  in  their
    best interests to remain with their parents. Although it is, of  course
    a question of fact for the Tribunal, I cannot see that the desirability
    of being educated at public expense in the UK can outweigh the  benefit
    to the children of remaining with their  parents.  Just  as  we  cannot
    proved medical treatment for  the  world,  so  we  cannot  educate  the
    world." The judge went on to state that it would have been  appropriate
    to consider the cost to the public purse in providing education to  the
    children. Ms Bexson submitted that the judge had given no consideration
    to the best interests of the children. However, it is  clear  that  the
    welfare of the children was carefully  considered.  At  �21  the  judge
    found  that  there  was  no  evidence  before  the  Tribunal  that  the
    children's  health  and  development  would  be  severely  affected  by
    returning to Nigeria with their parents.

19. In the circumstances, on the facts of this case, even if the Judge  had
    considered 276ADE(iv) in relation to the oldest child, there is nothing
    to demonstrate that it would be unreasonable to expect  that  child  to
    accompany his parents back to Nigeria. Whilst the best interests  of  a
    child are a primary consideration, it cannot be a trump card but should
    be considered with all the other relevant circumstances of the  family.
    I am satisfied that in effect this  is  what  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge has done. It would be a bizarre submission to suggest that simply
    because one child has spent 7 years in the UK the rest  of  the  family
    should also remain. I thus find there  is  no  material  error  in  not
    considering 276ADE(iv).

20.  In  relation  to  276ADE(vi)  and  the  adult  appellants,  the   same
    considerations that are apparent in the determination demonstrate  that
    they retain ties to Nigeria. The mother of the first  appellant  is  in
    contact with the family; she visits them in England once a year  (�14).
    Both first and second appellants have  family  in  Nigeria  (�15).  The
    difficulties the family would face on return to Nigeria were considered
    at �16. However, the judge reached the conclusion at �17 that there was
    no evidence that the family would not be able to resettle  in  Nigeria.
    Their evidence was that they had given no  thought  to  this,  although
    they have only ever been in the UK on a temporary basis.  It  is  clear
    that they retain ties to Nigeria, the country to which they  must  have
    expected to return on conclusion of the first appellant's studies. They
    are not entitled to remain simply because they now wish  to  settle  in
    the UK because it is  more  advantageous  to  them  that  returning  to
    Nigeria. The family has had no legitimate expectation of being able  to
    remain indefinitely in the UK.

21. In the circumstances, it is clear that consideration  of  276ADE  would
    not have been of assistance to the appellants and could  have  produced
    no different outcome. The judge considered  the  appellants  article  8
    ECHR rights but found no compelling circumstances to  justify  granting
    leave outside the Rules. The judge also stated  that  even  if  he  had
    considered article 8 private and family life outside the Rules he would
    have reached the same conclusion, as there was nothing to suggest  that
    removal was disproportionate.

22. It follows that even if there are errors of  law  in  not  specifically
    considering Appendix FM  and  276ADE,  there  are  no  material  errors
    requiring the decision of the First-tier Tribunal to be set aside. Even
    if I did set the decision aside and remade it,  it  is  clear  for  the
    reasons given above that I would have come to the same  conclusion  and
    dismissed the appeal.

Conclusions:

23. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should
    be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal of each appellant remains dismissed.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.




Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).



I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed.
