Representation:

For the claimant: Mr Islam, instructed by Kingswood Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mrs R Pettersen, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Secretary of State has appealed against the decision of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Phull promulgated  18.3.15,  dismissing  on  immigration
    grounds but allowing on human  rights  grounds  the  claimant's  appeal
    against  the  decision  of  the  Secretary  of  State  to  refuse   her
    application for leave to remain in the UK on the basis of  private  and
    family life outside the Immigration Rules and to remove her from the UK
    pursuant to section 47 of the Immigration Asylum  and  Nationality  Act
    2006. The Judge heard the appeal on 13.2.15.

 2. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Colyer  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    18.5.15.

 3. Thus the matter came before me on 18.4.16 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 4. I announced my error of law decision at the conclusion of  the  hearing
    before, reserving my reasons and the remaking of the  decision  in  the
    appeal. For the reasons set out below I found such error of law in  the
    making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  as  to  require  the
    decision of Judge Phull to be set aside and remade  by  dismissing  the
    appeal.

 5. In doing so, I have carefully  taken  into  account  all  the  evidence
    placed before me,  together  with  Mr  Islam's  oral  submissions.  The
    claimant did not attend the appeal hearing and no further evidence  was
    adduced before me. However, as requested by Mr Islam, I have  carefully
    considered the skeleton  argument  of  Mr  Azmi,  who  represented  the
    claimant  at  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  all  the  documents  in   the
    claimant's bundle served under cover of letter dated 23.9.14,  and  the
    supplementary bundle served under cover  of  letter  dated  9.2.15.  In
    addition, Mr Islam handed in a letter from Oaks Medical  Centre,  dated
    29.3.16, explaining that the claimant, who is 76 years of age,  suffers
    from hypertension, hypothyrodism and arthritis. The letter asserts that
    she lives with her daughter and is too frail  to  travel.  It  is  also
    stated that in the recent past her memory has been  declining  and  she
    needs more care  from  her  family  in  her  daily  living  activities,
    including taking her medications.

 6. I confirm that before making any of my findings of fact in the remaking
    of the appeal I have considered  all  the  available  evidence  in  the
    round, as a whole and in the context of the background information, the
    law and the Immigration Rules.

 7. In summary, the claimant came to the UK as a family  visitor  in  2012.
    Before her leave expired she made application on 21.9.12 for  leave  to
    remain, claiming family life with relatives in the UK. Her  application
    was refused in the decision  dated  23.4.14.  The  Secretary  of  State
    considered that the claimant did not qualify for leave to remain  under
    private or family life provisions of the Rules, and that there were  no
    exceptional circumstances insufficiently recognised  in  the  Rules  to
    justify granting leave to remain outside  the  Rules  under  article  8
    ECHR, on the basis that to remove her would be unjustifiably harsh.

 8. As  the  refusal  decision  explains,  the  claimant  cannot  meet  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules for leave to remain on the  basis
    of family life under Appendix FM. Having entered as a  family  visitor,
    with leave limited to a maximum period of 6 months, the claimant cannot
    switch to settlement on the basis of family life. The claimant was only
    granted entry clearance on the assertion that she intended to leave the
    UK at the completion of her family visit.

 9. Neither can the claimant meet the requirements of paragraph  276ADE  in
    respect of private life. She has not been in the UK  for  a  continuous
    period of at least 20 years. Neither can she demonstrate that  she  has
    no ties, including social, cultural or family, to Pakistan,  which  was
    the test applicable at the date of refusal decision. That test has  now
    been replaced  with  the  rather  more  stringent  test  requiring  the
    claimant to demonstrate that there are very  significant  obstacles  to
    her integration in Pakistan. The Secretary of State  pointed  out  that
    she spent the vast majority of her life in Pakistan and must  therefore
    retain cultural and  social  ties  to  Pakistan.  Whilst  some  of  her
    children reside in the UK, she still has children in Pakistan.

10. At ï¿½20 of the First-tier Tribunal decision, Judge Phull noted  that  it
    was accepted that the claimant  could  not  meet  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules to remain  an  adult  dependent  relative.  Mr  Islam
    suggested those Rules relate only to entry clearance cases. However,  I
    reject  his  submission  that  they  are  irrelevant  to   the   proper
    consideration of the claimant's case. Any assessment of article 8  ECHR
    has to be viewed through the prism of the Immigration Rules, which  are
    the Secretary of State's proportionate response to private  and  family
    life rights under article 8.

11. As the grounds point out, there are very stringent requirements in  the
    Immigration Rules for entry clearance as an adult  dependent  relative,
    under sections E-ECDR and E-ILRDR of Appendix FM. This  claimant  could
    not meet those requirements, not least because they apply only to entry
    clearance and those in the UK with existing valid leave to remain as an
    adult dependent relative, and not to other applications  for  leave  to
    remain. However, the  high  threshold  set  out  in  those  provisions,
    together with the specified evidence required under Appendix FM-SE  are
    highly relevant to the  assessment  of  what  might  be  considered  as
    compelling compassionate circumstances outside  the  Rules.  The  Rules
    are, of course, the Secretary  of  State's  balanced  response  between
    private and family life claims and the public interest  in  immigration
    control. Those provisions require an applicant to demonstrate that as a
    result of age, illness or  disability  he  or  she  requires  long-term
    personal care to perform everyday tasks and that they are unable,  even
    with the practical and financial help of the  sponsor,  to  obtain  the
    required level of care in their home country because either it  is  not
    available and there is no person in that  country  who  can  reasonably
    provide it, or it is not affordable. The specified evidence required to
    justify such a claim is also quite comprehensive including professional
    evidence.

12. It is clear on the facts  of  this  case  even  if  this  claimant  had
    existing leave to remain, she would not have met  the  adult  dependent
    relative requirements on the limited evidence before the tribunal.  For
    example, it was  not  demonstrated  that  she  would  be  unable,  with
    practical and financial help of other family members, both  in  the  UK
    and in Pakistan, to obtain the required level of assistance. There  was
    insufficient evidence to demonstrate that help was not available or not
    affordable.

13. It must be highly relevant to any article 8 proportionality  assessment
    that the claimant could not have met such requirements either for leave
    to remain, or for entry clearance from Pakistan.  However,  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge failed to take  this  very  important  factor  into
    account.

14. I also observe that, as now emphasised in SS (Congo)  [2015]  EWCA  Civ
    387, Judge Phull should not have gone on to  consider  article  8  ECHR
    outside the Rules without first  identifying  compelling  circumstances
    insufficiently recognised in the law or Immigration Rules, which is the
    test endorsed in Nagre v Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department
    [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin), to justify granting leave  to  remain  on  the
    basis of private and/or family life under article 8 ECHR, on the  basis
    that refusal to do so would be unjustifiably harsh. These are the  same
    considerations the Secretary  of  State  referred  to  in  the  refusal
    decision as 'exceptional circumstances.'


15. The Secretary of State found  no  such  compelling  circumstances,  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge did not identify any such, and I am satisfied
    on an assessment of all the evidence in the round that whilst one might
    well have sympathy with the claimant and her family members as  to  her
    ill-health,  advancing  age,  and  limited  personal   resources,   her
    circumstances  cannot  properly  be   described   as   compelling   and
    insufficiently recognised in the Immigration Rules. If the claimant  is
    in such difficult circumstances as would entitle her to entry clearance
    as an adult dependent relative, she could return to  Pakistan  to  make
    such an application. As stated above, the evidence to justify  granting
    such an application is  not  present,  even  though  there  is  medical
    evidence including a rather brief psychiatric  report  suggesting  that
    Mrs Syed  has  moderate  to  severe  vascular  dementia  and  secondary
    depressive illness, with a poor prognosis. It is  not  really  relevant
    that her medical treatment has been privately funded in the UK, as such
    financial support can be provided to  her  in  Pakistan.  There  is  no
    evidence that appropriate medical treatment and  care  support  is  not
    available in Pakistan, as the  Secretary  of  State  has  pointed  out,
    referring to the country of origin report for  Pakistan,  which  states
    that adequate basic non-emergency medical care is  available  in  major
    Pakistani cities and thus she can access treatment in her home country.



16. I find that the First-tier Tribunal Judge has  confused  the  level  of
    care and treatment the claimant is receiving in the UK with what she is
    entitled to expect if returned to  Pakistan.  Such  statements  as  the
    judge made at ï¿½36, "I  find  that  even  if  practical  care  could  be
    purchased, the appellant would not receive the same level of  emotional
    support from the carers as she does from Mrs Shah,"  are  unsustainable
    as they misunderstand or misconstrue article 8 private or  family  life
    rights. The conclusion in that paragraph  that  removing  the  claimant
    from the "stable practical care and emotional support she  receives  in
    the UK would result in a breach of  her  article  8  rights,"  is  also
    unsustainable and an error of law. The  claimant  is  not  entitled  to
    remain in the UK because that level of care or treatment is said to  be
    not available in Pakistan.  She  has  two  daughters  still  living  in
    Pakistan; that they have their own  families  and  that  there  may  be
    cultural norms requiring them to put  their  own  families  before  the
    claimant's welfare does not render the claimant entitled to  remain  in
    the UK at the economic burden of the state.

17. In Razgar, R (on the Application of) v SSHD [2004]  UKHL  27,  Baroness
    Hale said:

         "Although the possibility cannot be excluded, it  is  not  easy  to
         think of a foreign health care case which would fail under  Article
         3 but succeed under Article 8.  There clearly must be a strong case
         before the Article is even engaged and then a fair balance must  be
         struck under Article 8(2).  In striking that balance, only the most
         compelling humanitarian considerations are likely to  prevail  over
         the legitimate aims of immigration control or public  safety.   The
         expelling state is required to assess the strength  of  the  threat
         and strike that  balance.   It  is  not  required  to  compare  the
         adequacy of the health care available in the  two  countries.   The
         question is whether removal to the  foreign  country  will  have  a
         sufficiently adverse  effect  upon  the  applicant.   Nor  can  the
         expelling state be required to assume a more favourable  status  in
         its own territory than the applicant is currently entitled to.  The
         applicant remains to  be  treated  as  someone  who  is  liable  to
         expulsion, not as someone who is entitled to remain."

18. Similarly, in N v SSHD [2005] UKHL 31, Lord Hope  stated,  "...  aliens
    who are subject to expulsion cannot claim any entitlement to remain  in
    the territory of a contracting state in order to  continue  to  benefit
    from medical, social or other  forms  of  assistance  provided  by  the
    expelling state.  For an  exception  to  be  made  where  expulsion  is
    resisted on medical grounds the circumstances must be exceptional."

 1. More recently, In Akhalu (health claim: ECHR Article 8) Nigeria  [2013]
    UKUT 00400 (IAC) the Upper Tribunal held:

         "(1) MM (Zimbabwe) v Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department
             [2012] EWCA Civ 279 does not  establish  that  a  claimant  is
             disqualified from accessing the protection of article 8  where
             an aspect of her claim is a difficulty or inability to  access
             health care in her country of  nationality  unless,  possibly,
             her private or family life has a bearing upon  her  prognosis.
             The correct approach is not to leave out of account  what  is,
             by any view, a material consideration of central importance to
             the  individual  concerned   but   to   recognise   that   the
             countervailing public interest in removal  will  outweigh  the
             consequences for the health  of  the  claimant  because  of  a
             disparity of health care facilities in all but a very few rare
             cases.

         (2)  The consequences of removal for the health of a  claimant  who
             would not be able to access equivalent health  care  in  their
             country of nationality as was available in  this  country  are
             plainly relevant to the  question  of  proportionality.   But,
             when weighed against the public interest in ensuring that  the
             limited resources of this country's health service are used to
             the best effect for the benefit of those  for  whom  they  are
             intended, those consequences  do  not  weigh  heavily  in  the
             claimant's favour but speak cogently in support of the  public
             interests in removal."

19. In GS (India) and Others v SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ 40 the Court of Appeal,
    upholding the Upper Tribunal, has held that foreign  nationals  may  be
    removed from the United Kingdom even where, by  reason  of  a  lack  of
    adequate healthcare in the  destination  state,  their  lives  will  be
    drastically  shortened.   Such  action  does  not,  save  in  the  most
    exceptional case, infringe Article 3 or 8  ECHR.   Laws  LJ  emphasised
    that the paradigm case of a breach of Article 3 is "an intentional  act
    which  constitutes  torture  or  inhuman  or  degrading  treatment   or
    punishment".  Where in any given case there is a risk of  death  caused
    by a naturally occurring illness combined with  a  lack  of  sufficient
    resources to treat this adequately or effectively  in  the  destination
    state, the paradigm is not satisfied.

20. In the circumstances, it is clear that the First-tier Tribunal  applied
    the wrong test when considering the emotional  and  medical  needs  and
    circumstances of the claimant and for that reason, independent of other
    errors, the decision is flawed and cannot stand.  It  cannot  be  said,
    whatever sympathy one might have for the claimant,  that  her  medical,
    care and emotional needs amount to the most exceptional  or  compelling
    circumstances.

21.  I  am  not  satisfied  that  there  are  any  sufficiently  compelling
    circumstances on the facts of this case to entertain article 8 ECHR  at
    all. However, even if an article 8 ECHR proportionality assessment  was
    justified, the decision was flawed for the reasons set  out  above,  by
    failing to bring into the assessment the  equivalent  requirements  for
    leave to remain or entry clearance as an adult dependent relative,  and
    that the claimant cannot  meet  paragraph  276ADE  of  the  Immigration
    Rules.

22. The decision is also flawed for failure to adequately  address  section
    117B of the 2002 Act. I accept  that  the  judge  has  referenced  that
    section and that immigration is in the  public  interest.  However,  in
    error the judge appears to have given credit to the  claimant  for  not
    being a burden on the state. No such credit is available,  even  though
    it is in the public interest that a person seeking leave to  remain  is
    financially independent. Neither is the  claimant  entitled  to  credit
    against the public interest for  not  overstaying  when  she  made  her
    application for leave to remain.  There  is  no  credit  available  for
    complying with the law; doing no more than complying with the law  does
    not strengthen the claimant's case or reduce the public interest in her
    removal. Further, the judge appears to have ignored the fact that under
    section 117B little weight is to be given to a person whose immigration
    status is precarious, as was that of this claimant.

23. In remaking the decision in the appeal I find that even if any  article
    8 Razgar stepped proportionality assessment was justified, which  I  do
    not accept, on the facts of this case the public interest in removal of
    the  claimant  is  not  outweighed  by  the  claimant's  circumstances,
    including all those matters  set  out  in  the  claimant's  documentary
    evidence, Mr Islam's submissions, and the skeleton argument urged  upon
    me. On the  facts  of  this  case  little  weight  can  attach  to  the
    claimant's private life in the UK and whilst she may have a  degree  of
    family life with relatives in the UK, she also  had  family  life  with
    relatives in Pakistan. It is highly relevant that she cannot  meet  any
    of the requirements of the Immigration Rules, or even the  standard  of
    needs set out in the Rules for admitting or allowing to stay  an  adult
    dependent relative. The claimant is not entitled to settle in  the  UK.
    She came to the UK as a family visitor with  the  avowed  intention  to
    leave after a short family visit.  That  her  health  has  deteriorated
    through old age and  related  ailments  does  not  render  her  removal
    disproportionate when care is available for her in Pakistan, even if it
    is at a lower or less adequate level than she is presently receiving in
    the UK. Article 8 does not guarantee a level of personal care.

24. In all the circumstances, taking all of  the  evidence  together  as  a
    whole, in the round, and bearing in mind that it is for  the  Secretary
    of State to demonstrate that the decision is proportionate, I find that
    the  decision  was  entirely  justified  and  proportionate   and   not
    disproportionate to the claimant's article 8 ECHR  rights.  It  follows
    that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  must  be  set  aside  for
    error of law and remade by dismissing the appeal.

Conclusions:

25. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should  be
    set aside.

     I set aside the decision.

                    I re-make the decision in the appeal by dismissing it on
                    immigration and human rights grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed and thus there can be no fee award.
