                                   Between


               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent

                         (ANONYMITY DIRECTION made)
                                                                  Appellants


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The claimants,  the  Appellants  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  are
    citizens of Ghana.

 2. These proceedings concerned the status and interests of  a  child.   In
    order to protect the child I make an anonymity direction.

 3. The Appellant in the proceedings in the Upper Tribunal is the Secretary
    of State for the Home Department (SSHD).

 4. This appeal came to the Upper Tribunal as an appeal by the SSHD against
    the determination of First-tier Tribunal Judge Hussain  promulgated  on
    20th February 2015, whereby the judge allowed  the  Claimants'  appeals
    against the decisions of the  SSHD  dated  26th  September  2014.   The
    decisions by the SSHD were to refuse  each  of  the  Claimants  further
    leave to remain in the United Kingdom and thereupon to remove  each  of
    them from the United Kingdom to their country of nationality.

 5. By decision dated 21st July 2015 I ruled  that  there  was  a  material
    error of law  in  the  original  judge's  determination  and  set  that
    decision aside and directed that the matter be reheard before me.  Thus
    the matter came before me on 24th November  2015  to  hear  the  appeal
    afresh.

 6. For the purposes of the present proceedings in order to avoid confusion
    I will refer to the Secretary of State for the Home Department  as  the
    SSHD and the "Appellants" in the First-tier as the Claimants.

 7. The Claimants constitute a father, mother and child of a single  family
    unit.  The father of the family, the first Claimant, came to the United
    Kingdom as a student in 2005.  He has undertaken a number of courses of
    study ultimately studying a Masters Degree in Business  Administration.
    In 2006 the mother of the family, the second claimant, joined the first
    Claimant as his dependant.  She entered on the  10th  June  2006.   The
    child of the family, the third Claimant, was born on 11th August  2007.
    Since coming to the United Kingdom the family have lived  and  remained
    here.

 8. There was reference in the evidence given before me to  the  fact  that
    the first Claimant had returned to Ghana on three  or  four  occasions.
    He had returned to Ghana in July 2008 for three weeks, in 2009 for  two
    weeks and for ten days in  March  2012  and  possibly  on  one  further
    occasion.  The reasons for returning to Ghana are  variously  given  as
    the death of an uncle and the death  of  a  stepmother  and  to  settle
    affairs there.

 9. It appears that throughout the first  and  second  Claimants  have  had
    leave and have always made application to remain in time.  The  present
    applications by the Claimants were made in August 2013.   By  decisions
    made by the SSHD in or  about  August  2013  the  applications  by  the
    Claimants were refused.  The decisions were to refuse to vary leave  to
    remain and to remove the Claimants to Ghana.   The  Claimants  appealed
    against those decisions.

10. The appeals were first heard by Immigration Judge Traynor on 11th  June
    2014.  The judge ruled that the decisions were not in  accordance  with
    the law by reason of the failure of the SSHD to consider the Article  8
    rights of the parties and by reason of
    the failure of the SSHD to take account of Section 55 of  the  Borders,
    Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009, relating to taking account of the
    best interests of children.  The appeals were allowed and it  was  held
    that there was an application before the SSHD which required  a  lawful
    decision.

11. In consequence of the decision of Judge Traynor the  SSHD  reconsidered
    the application and made further decisions on 30th  September  2014  in
    respect of all the Claimants.  It was  decided  again  to  refuse  them
    leave to remain in the United Kingdom and to remove the Claimants  from
    the United Kingdom.

12. The Claimants appealed against those decisions and as  indicated  above
    the appeals were first heard by Judge Hussain.  Judge Hussain as stated
    allowed the appeals.  I have set Judge Hussain's decisions  aside.  The
    appeals were to be heard afresh.

13. Given the passage of time since the first hearing before Judge  Hussain
    the basis of the appeals had developed. Whilst section 85 of  the  2002
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act would preclude the introduction
    of a new matter without the consent of the SSHD, at the hearing  before
    me it was accepted that the full  circumstances  as  a  man  should  be
    considered.

14. According to the Claimants' representatives the basis of the Claimants'
    case was:-

      a) that the first Claimant now met the requirements of paragraph 276B;

      b) that the third Claimant satisfied the  requirements  of  paragraphs
         276ADE(iv);

      c) that otherwise consideration had to  be  given  to  the  Article  8
         rights of the Claimants, given the length of  time  that  they  had
         been in the United Kingdom; and

      d) that the third Claimant having been born in the UK would  within  a
         relatively short space of time be entitled to British citizenship.

15. The SSHD in response indicated that the grounds under the Rules had  to
    be considered at the date of application.  As the applications  had  to
    be considered in principle at the date  of  application  the  Claimants
    could not rely upon the majority of the Immigration Rules  but  had  to
    rely upon Article 8 outside the Rules.

Law

16. The Claimants may be able to succeed either in their  own  right  under
    the Rules or Article 8 or if one of the other Claimants succeeds  as  a
    dependant of that claimant.

17. In respect of the Immigration Rules the burden is upon the Claimants to
    prove that they meet all the requirements of the Immigration Rules,  on
    which reliance is placed.  The standard of  proof  is  the  balance  of
    probabilities.

18. In respect of Article 8 it is for the Claimants to prove that they have
    a family and private life  in  the  United  Kingdom.   It  is  for  the
    Claimants to prove that the decision so significantly  interferes  with
    that family and private life that Article 8 is engaged.  Thereafter the
    decision has to be in accordance with the law and for a purpose set out
    within  the  Article  itself,  in  these  circumstances  the   economic
    wellbeing of the country in the guise of immigration control.   Finally
    it is for the Respondent to prove that the decision is  proportionately
    justified under Article 8.  In  considering  Article  8  I  follow  the
    approach recommended in the case of Razgar 2004 UKHL.

19. In considering the appeals I have also to take account of  Section  117
    of the 2002 Act as amended in respect of any  Article  8  claim  either
    under the rules or outside the rules. I have  also  to  consider  as  a
    primary matter section 55 of the 2009 Act and the best interests of any
    child.

20. In respect of these appeals potentially issues arise under Appendix  FM
    and appendix FM-SE both as a spouse and as a child of a person  present
    and settled in the UK.

21. With  regard  to  the  second  Claimant  none  of  the  suitability  or
    eligibility issues  would  arise  save  in  respect  of  the  financial
    requirements and the documents necessary to prove the required level of
    income at the date of the application. Required documentation has to be
    provided with the application and has to prove an income of �18,600 for
    a couple plus �3,800 for the first child or savings of  specific  level
    to make up any shortfall in the income levels.  [see paragraphs  E-LTRP
    3.1-3.2 and E-LTRC.2.1-2.2 in conjunction with Appendix  FM-SE].If  the
    first Claimant succeeds, then both the second and third Claimants  have
    to be considered as dependent spouse and child. If the  third  Claimant
    succeeds then the first and second Claimants have to be  considered  as
    dependent parents.

22. I also draw attention to paragraph EX.1-2. It is to be noted  that  the
    Rule stipulates that consideration has to the date of the  application.
    Paragraph EX.1 provides:-
         Exception
         Section EX: Exception
         EX.1. This paragraph applies if

         (a) (i) the applicant has a genuine and subsisting parental
         relationship with a child who-

         (aa) is under the age of 18 years, or was under the age of 18 years
         when the applicant was first granted leave on the basis that this
         paragraph applied;
         (bb) is in the UK;
         (cc) is a British Citizen or has lived in the UK continuously for
         at least the 7 years immediately preceding the date of application
         ;and

         (ii) it would not be reasonable to expect the child to leave the
         UK; or

         (b) the applicant has a genuine and subsisting relationship with a
         partner who is in the UK and is a British Citizen, settled in the
         UK or in the UK with refugee leave or humanitarian protection, and
         there are insurmountable obstacles to family life with that partner
         continuing outside the UK.


23. EX.1 excludes an applicant from meeting certain of the requirements  of
    the rules under Appendix FM specifically the financial requirements  in
    certain given cirucmstances.

24. In respect of the first claimant reliance has been placed on  paragraph
    276B. The Rule provides:-

         "Requirements for indefinite leave to remain on the ground of  long
         residence in the United Kingdom

         276B The requirements to be met  by  an  applicant  for  indefinite
                leave to remain on the  ground  of  long  residence  in  the
                United Kingdom are that:

                (i)    (a)  he has had at least ten years' continuous lawful
                        residence in the United Kingdom;

                (ii)   having regard to the public  interest  there  are  no
                    reasons why it would be undesirable for him to be  given
                    indefinite  leave  to  remain  on  the  ground  of  long
                    residence taking into account his:

                   (a) age; and

                   (b) strength of connections in the United Kingdom; and

                    (c)  personal  history,  including  character,  conduct,
                        associations and employment record; and

                   (d) domestic circumstances; and

                   (e) compassionate circumstances; and

                   (f) any representations received on the person's  behalf;
                        and

                (iii)  the applicant does not fall  for  refusal  under  the
                    general grounds for refusal;

                (iv)   the applicant has demonstrated  sufficient  knowledge
                    of the English language and sufficient  knowledge  about
                    the life in  the  United  Kingdom,  in  accordance  with
                    Appendix KoLL;

                (v)    the applicant must not be in the  United  Kingdom  in
                    breach of immigration laws except  that  any  period  of
                    overstaying for a period of 28  days  or  less  will  be
                    disregarded, as will any period of  overstaying  between
                    periods of entry clearance, leave to enter or  leave  to
                    remain of up to 28 days and any  period  of  overstaying
                    pending the determination of an application made  within
                    that 28 day period."

25. Appendix KoLL provides for knowledge of language and life.  As set  out
    within Part 1: General, the purpose is to ensure that an applicant  has
    sufficient knowledge of English language and about life in  the  United
    Kingdom where it is a requirement of the Rules to demonstrate such.  As
    Part 2: Knowledge of Language and Life, subparagraph 2.2:-

         "(iv)    acknowledges that an academic  qualification  obtained  in
             the United Kingdom and recognised by  UK  NARIC  to  meet  the
             recognised standard of a bachelors or masters degree or PhD in
             the UK; and

               1) provides the specified documentary evidence to show he has
                  the qualification; and

               2) UK NARIC has confirmed that the qualification  was  taught
                  and researched in English; or

         (v)  the applicant has obtained an academic qualification which  is
             deemed by UK NARIC  to  meet  the  recognised  standard  of  a
             bachelors or masters degree or PhD in the UK and provides  the
             specified evidence to show:

              (1) he has the qualification; and

              (2) that the qualification was taught or researched in English
             ..."

 1. Finally the requirements of paragraph 2.3 have also  to  be  met  which
    indicates that a person demonstrates  sufficient  knowledge  about  the
    life in the United Kingdom if:-

         "(a) the applicant had passed the test known as the Life in the  UK
             test administered by Learn Direct Ltd."

 1. The third Claimant was  seeking  to  rely  upon  paragraph  276ADE.  In
    respect of paragraph 276ADE the paragraph provides as follows:-
         Requirements to be met by an applicant for leave to remain on the
         grounds of private life

         276ADE. The requirements to be met by an applicant for leave to
         remain on the
         grounds of private life in the UK are that at the date of
         application, the applicant:

         (i) does not fall for refusal under any of the grounds in Section S-
         LTR 1.2 to S-LTR 2.3. and S-LTR.3.1. in Appendix FM; and

         (ii) has made a valid application for leave to remain on the
         grounds of private life in the UK; and

         (iii) has lived continuously in the UK for at least 20 years
         (discounting any period of imprisonment); or

         (iv) is under the age of 18 years and has lived continuously in the
         UK for at least 7 years (discounting any period of imprisonment)
         and it would not be reasonable to expect the applicant to leave the
         UK; or

         (v) is aged 18 years or above and under 25 years and has spent at
         least half of his life living continuously in the UK (discounting
         any period of imprisonment); or

         (vi) is aged 18 years or above, has lived continuously in the UK
         for less than 20 years (discounting any period of imprisonment) but
         has no ties (including social, cultural or family) with the country
         to which he would have to go if required to leave the UK.


Factual Background

 2. The first Claimant as stated is a national of Ghana.  Prior  to  coming
    to the United Kingdom he was employed as  an  athletics  coach  by  the
    National Sports Council in Ghana for eighteen years.   He  had  married
    the second Claimant in May 2003.  He admits however  in  his  statement
    that he realised that his position as an athletics coach was not paying
    sufficient salary to sustain a reasonable standard of living and seeing
    no opportunity for advancement he resigned in 2005.   He  had  made  an
    application to come to the United Kingdom to study to better himself.

 3. The Claimant had family in the United  Kingdom,  who  were  willing  to
    assist and support him in the United Kingdom whilst  he  studied.   His
    application to come  to  the  United  Kingdom  had  been  granted.   He
    therefore came to study.  He came in May 2005  and  has  been  studying
    since in the United Kingdom finally completing his  MBA  in  July  2013
    with the award ceremony in March 2014.

 4. As stated the first Claimant made a further application  to  remain  in
    the United Kingdom on 8th August 2013.   The  first  Claimant  suggests
    that he wanted to study on an ACCA course but whilst  he  was  awaiting
    the award of his MBA the first Claimant could not make  an  application
    to study on the ACCA as he did not have the required MBA qualification.
     The first Claimant with the second and third Claimants  as  dependants
    therefore made an application for a short period of discretionary leave
    until such times as he could make an application to stay and study (see
    paragraph 43 of his statement).

 5. I would however point out that there may have been problems with regard
    to the possibility of the first Claimant continuing his  leave  on  the
    basis of studying in the United Kingdom.  The provisions  of  paragraph
    245ZX stipulate that courses at degree level or below must  not  result
    in an applicant having spent  more  than  three  years  in  the  United
    Kingdom and that for courses at degree level or  above  the  period  is
    five years in the United Kingdom.  The first claimant clearly has spent
    more time in the United  Kingdom  than  is  permitted  under  paragraph
    245ZX(h) and (ha).

 6. As stated the first  Claimant  came  to  the  United  Kingdom  for  the
    purposes of study in May 2005.  He was joined by his  wife  the  second
    Claimant in 2006.  In August 2007 the third Claimant was born.

 7. At the date of the applications, August 2013, the third Claimant  would
    have been 5 or 6 years at best.

 8. Since coming to the United Kingdom the  first  Claimant  not  only  has
    studied but has also acted as a pastor in the Mountain of the Fire  and
    Miracle Ministry.  It appears also that  he  has  permanent  employment
    with Nationwide Security.  It appears that he has had  that  employment
    since 2nd March 2006.

 9. Again I draw attention to paragraph 245ZY (iii) and the provisions that
    preceded it of the rules, which prescribed that a student  may  not  be
    employed save for limited number of hours per week. It may be that  the
    first Claimant worked within the terms of the rules but the  suggestion
    appears in the letter from the employer that he was working full-time.

10. There are letters confirming that the first Claimant has been a  pastor
    and mentor at the Mountain of the Fire and Miracle  Ministry  for  over
    seven years as of 2014.  He  is  active  as  a  teacher,  preacher  and
    counsellor in the church and is  part  of  the  management  team.   The
    church is a charitable institution.  The experience and  qualifications
    of the first Claimant are held to be highly useful in the church.

11. There are other letters confirming the employment of not only the first
    Claimant but also the second Claimant.  There was no limitation on  the
    work of the second Claimant. There is a letter from Nationwide Security
    confirming that the first Claimant has been  employed  on  a  permanent
    basis since March 2006.  Whilst questions were asked as to  whether  or
    not he had been vetted for the purposes of acting as a security  guard,
    it appears that the first Claimant has never had any troubles with  the
    police and he believes that he has all the qualifications necessary  to
    continue in his employment.

12. The income of the Claimants has not  been  disclosed  or  supported  by
    documentary evidence.

13. With regard to the second Claimant it appears that she was employed  by
    a Mr Parry as a carer and had been from 2nd January 2007.   The  second
    Claimant remained a carer for Mr Parry until Mr Parry's death  on  23rd
    June 2014.  In the documents submitted is a letter from  Mr  Parry.  Mr
    Parry submitted a glowing reference on behalf of the second Claimant.

14. As stated when the first Claimant came to the  United  Kingdom  he  was
    supported by his brother and sister.  It appears that his brother  came
    to the United Kingdom and qualified as a pharmacist and  has  become  a
    British citizen.  With regard to the first Claimant's sister  she  came
    to study nursing, she also is qualified and is now a  British  citizen.
    The first Claimant himself came to  the  United  Kingdom  as  a  mature
    student at the age of 44.

15. The first Claimant's brother and sister have  children  of  their  own.
    His brother has one child.  His sister,  although  separated  from  her
    husband, has twin boys although they are now aged 24.

16. Besides having aunts, uncles and cousins  in  the  United  Kingdom  the
    third Claimant  has  also  settled  into  life  at  school.   There  is
    reference to the fact that he has been good in sports.  He has  already
    won medals in  school  athletics'  events.   It  is  suggested  in  the
    statement of the first Claimant that the third Claimant does  not  like
    traditional African or Ghanaian food and likes local food in the United
    Kingdom.  The child was extremely distraught at the suggestion that  he
    may have to relocate to Ghana with his parents.  The child is concerned
    because he would lose both his friends at school and his  friends  from
    the church.  The child was upset because he would lose contact with his
    cousins.

17. The first Claimant in his statement alleges that  on  return  to  Ghana
    they would face uncertainty as to accommodation and do not  know  where
    they would find accommodation.  He also asserts that the third Claimant
    would find it difficult at school as he would be an  outsider  and  may
    face bullying and intimidation.  It is alleged that the third  Claimant
    would not be able to speak the local language.

18. The family life in Watford in a maisonette rented  with  two  bedrooms.
    The third Claimant has his own  bedroom.   It  is  submitted  that  the
    prospects facing the family on returning to Ghana  would  be  that  the
    first  Claimant  aged  over  50  would   have   to   find   employment,
    accommodation and the prospects  for  the  family  would  be  extremely
    difficult.

19. Besides having friends in the local Mountain of the  Fire  and  Miracle
    Ministry Church they also  claim  to  have  friends  within  the  wider
    community in Watford.  They attend regularly at the church in  Watford.
    It was accepted however  that  the  church  had  a  division  in  Ghana
    although they are not in touch with that division.

20. Again with regard to return to Ghana it is  suggested  that  the  third
    Claimant may have difficulty getting into a school  as  the  first  and
    second Claimants would not have the financial  means  to  pay  for  the
    school.  That may mean that the third Claimant would have to  go  to  a
    Government school where the standard of teaching is much below that  in
    a western school.

21. The third Claimant claims that teaching in Ghana is  not  generally  in
    English, it is likely to be in Ewe, it is suggested therefore  that  it
    would not be in the best interests of the child for the child to return
    to Ghana. It is claimed that the third Claimant enjoys English food and
    does not like the food that is available in Ghana.

22. In the documentation currently submitted before me is also  a  copy  of
    the Life in the UK Test  pass  certificate  dated  10th  July  2015  in
    respect of the first Claimant.  It appears that the first Claimant  has
    taken and passed the required test.  I have also been provided  with  a
    copy of the first Claimant's MBA from the Roehampton University awarded
    in 2014.

Conclusions

23. The first Claimant came to the  United  Kingdom  in  2005.   The  first
    Claimant has had leave since his first entry  through  to  the  present
    day. Whilst part of that leave was dependent upon 3C  leave  after  the
    decision was taken in August 2013 which resulted in the  appeal  before
    Judge Traynor, it is correct to say that the Appellant has  always  had
    leave throughout the whole of the period.  Therefore the first Claimant
    has had lawful leave for at least ten years.

24. Whilst it has to be accepted that he came to the United Kingdom at  the
    age of 44 and is now aged 54 and over it has to be noted  that  he  has
    formed  substantial  and  significant  connections  within  the  United
    Kingdom.  He has a settled lifestyle.   He  has  not  only  employment,
    which he has maintained for a considerable period of time, but he  also
    has work in the community in the  form  of  involvement  with  a  local
    church  and  community  organisation.   There  is  nothing  within  the
    character or conduct of the first  Claimant  which  detracts  from  him
    being a suitable candidate to be given indefinite leave  in  accordance
    with paragraph 276B.  He does not fall for refusal  under  the  general
    grounds of refusal.

25. The sole issue that appears to  arise  is  whether  or  not  the  first
    Claimant has met the requirements of Appendix KoLL.  As is evident from
    Part 2 paragraphs 2.1 and 2.3 the requirements with regard to that  are
    met where the first Claimant has passed a test known as the Life in the
    UK test administered by Learn  Direct  Ltd.   The  first  Claimant  has
    produced the required test certificate.  He has otherwise taken an  MBA
    qualification at Roehampton University.

26. Taking those circumstances into account it is correct to say  that  the
    first Claimant meets the requirements of  the  Immigration  Rules  with
    regard to 276B.  Albeit that that has come about  because  the  appeals
    process has taken some years to complete it does not detract  from  the
    fact that the first Claimant meets the requirements of the Rule.

27.  Dealing  with  the  third  Claimant,  the  Claimant's  representatives
    submitted that he would be entitled  to  be  registered  as  a  British
    citizen once he has completed ten years lawful residence in the  United
    Kingdom.  However he was not born until August 2007.  He would  not  be
    capable of being registered as a British citizen until August 2017.  He
    is not a British citizen and is not entitled to be treated as a British
    citizen.  He has spent nine years in the UK now.

28. With regard to consideration of the third  Claimant  and  of  paragraph
    276ADE it has to be noted that the paragraph in  question  specifically
    imposes an obligation to look at the Rules and situation at the date of
    the application.  Thus in order to achieve the seven  years'  residence
    in the United Kingdom to meet the requirements of paragraph 276ADE  the
    third Claimant would have had to have had seven years' lawful residence
    at the date of application.  The application as set out above was  made
    in August 2013 at a time when the third Claimant was only 5 or 6.   The
    third Claimant therefore does not meet the requirements of the Rules in
    respect of 276ADE.

29. I would however note that in considering the third Claimant within  the
    Refusal Letter the date adopted by the author of the letter as material
    appears to be the date of the reconsideration of the application,  post
    the appeal having been allowed by Judge Traynor, not the  date  of  the
    application itself.  It was accepted that the third Claimant had  lived
    in the United Kingdom for at least seven years preceding  the  date  of
    the reconsideration.

30. Whilst it has to be acknowledged that the refusal letter appears to  be
    concentrating on the relationship of the first Claimant  to  the  third
    Claimant with a view to whether or not paragraph EX.1  applies  to  the
    first Claimant, once it has been established that  the  first  Claimant
    succeeds,  the  third  claimant  has  to  be  considered  as  a  child.
    Consideration of the requirements set out in  Section  R-LTRC  indicate
    that the third Claimant appears to meet all of  the  requirements  save
    and except for the financial requirements.  Much though the  first  and
    second Claimants have submitted that they were in employment I have  no
    evidence as to what their incomes were.

31. If the first Claimant succeeds as indicated above  the  third  Claimant
    may have been able to succeed as a child but evidence would have to  be
    produced that the financial requirements of  Appendix  FM  [E-ELTRC2.1]
    are met.  On the basis of the evidence submitted I do not see that  the
    financial requirements have been evidenced.

32. The third Claimant is  not  a  British  citizen  and  at  the  date  of
    application has not been in the  United  Kingdom  for  at  least  seven
    years.  However if the third Claimant were now to make  an  application
    clearly he would have been in the United Kingdom for a period of  seven
    years, the issue then would be whether or not it would be reasonable to
    expect him to return with his parents to Ghana.

33. In that respect I take account of the evidence that has been presented.
     I take account of the best interests of the child.  The best interests
    of the child are clearly to remain in a  single,  stable  family  unit.
    That would be with both parents  rather  than  with  just  one  parent.
    Whilst the child seems to indicate that he does not like Ghanaian  food
    and there is a claim that he may not be able to speak a local language,
    it has to be noted that English  is  an  official  language  of  Ghana.
    Whilst again it has to be noted that he is well-established in  school,
    he is reaching an age where he would in any event be  changing  from  a
    primary school into a secondary school and consideration will  have  to
    be given to the fact that there is going to be disruption in any event.
     It is suggested that he would be going to  an  alien  country  and  he
    would be leaving all his friends and family behind.

34. However when questioned with regard to the matter  the  first  Claimant
    and second Claimant had to admit that there were other  family  members
    in Ghana.  Whilst it may be he would not have  immediate  contact  with
    his first cousins, there is evidence that there are other relatives  in
    Ghana with whom he would have contact.

35. If the third Claimant were  now  to  make  an  application  based  upon
    paragraph 276ADE, consideration would have to be given as to whether it
    would be reasonable to expect him to return to Ghana.  I am not however
    considering such an application.  It  would  not  be  a  breach  of  an
    individual's  Human  Rights  to  expect  an  individual  to   make   an
    application to the Secretary of State for the Home Department.

36. Insofar as the first Claimant would be entitled to remain in the United
    Kingdom that is not to say that he has to.   The  issue  thereafter  is
    whether  or  not  either  the  second  or  third  Claimant   meet   the
    requirements of the Rules.  As far as I can see no effort has been made
    to show that the second and third  Claimants  can  meet  the  financial
    requirements of the Rules.

37. With regard to the requirements for leave to remain as a spouse or as a
    child, the requirements is that specified evidence has to  be  provided
    to show a gross income of �18,600 plus  �3,800  for  the  first  child.
    That evidence has not been put  forward.   Evidence  of  the  financial
    circumstances would be needed to enable the child  to  seek  to  remain
    under Appendix FM.

38. For the reasons set out I do not find that the third Claimant meets the
    requirements of the rules

39. With regard to the second Claimant paragraph EX.1 may assist in a sense
    with regard to the financial requirements but only either  because  she
    is in a relationship with a  person  that  is  settled  in  the  United
    Kingdom, the first Claimant, or the child had succeeded  and  it  would
    not be reasonable to expect the child to leave the United Kingdom.  For
    the reasons set out I do not find that the  child  succeeds  under  the
    Rules.  It may be an issue as to whether or not the child  succeeds  on
    Article 8 grounds.

40. However with regard to the  second  Claimant  either  evidence  of  the
    financial requirements is produced or paragraph EX.1(b)  requires  that
    there be insurmountable obstacles to family life continuing outside the
    United Kingdom.  While they have indicated that there may  be  problems
    with the child's education and  accommodation  and  finding  employment
    those are not insurmountable obstacles.  The first Claimant came  at  a
    time when he was already 44 years of age and indicated that he intended
    to return to Ghana.  It may be that a substantial period  of  time  has
    passed but such are not insurmountable obstacles.

41. Clearly if the child had succeeded then consideration would  have  also
    had to have been given to Section 117B(6).  Where again the issue would
    be reasonableness.

42. As set out above, the fact that the  first  Claimant  succeeds  on  the
    basis of paragraph 276B does not say that  he  has  to  remain  in  the
    United Kingdom but merely that he is  able  to  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom.

43. Given that no evidence has been adduced of the income of the  Claimants
    and given that the EX.1 does not apply because I find that there are no
    insurmountable obstacles to the family settling in Ghana, I do not find
    that the second Claimant meets the requirements of the Rules.

44. With regard to the Claimants, clearly there is a family life which  has
    been developed over a significant period of time.   Clearly  given  the
    length of time that each of them has been in the  United  Kingdom  they
    have developed significant aspects of private life both with regard  to
    employment, careers, accommodation, schooling, associations within  the
    local community and other factors constituting a private life.

45. Clearly the decision is such as to interfere with family and/or private
    life but the decision is  in  accordance  with  the  law  and  for  the
    purposes of maintaining immigration control.  The issue  thereafter  is
    whether or not the decision is proportionately justified.

46. I take account of the length of time that the family has  been  in  the
    United Kingdom and the fact that the  child  was  born  here.   I  take
    account of the child's schooling and his personal preferences.  I  take
    account of the child's preferences.   However  they  are  nationals  of
    Ghana.  There is a means by which they could remain provided  it  could
    be proved that  the  Claimants  earn  sufficient  monies  to  meet  the
    requirements of Appendix  FM.   However  they  have  not  produced  the
    evidence to show that they do meet the requirements of Appendix FM  and
    the required documentary evidence  for  Appendix  FM-SE  had  not  been
    produced.

47. In the case of EV [Philippines] &  Ors  v  SSHD  [2014]  EWCA  Civ  874
    states  nationality or a right to remain in the United Kingdom is not a
    trump card, it is but one factor to take  into  account.   However  the
    Claimants have always lawfully been in the United Kingdom and sought to
    abide by the laws of the land.  They have made applications in order to
    extend their leave at appropriate times. It is clear that the Claimants
    are settled in the area  of  Watford.   It  is  clear  that  they  have
    accommodation and they have employment.

48. Set against that is the uncertain future that would face the family  on
    return to Ghana.  However the Claimants came on a temporary  basis  and
    had no expectation that they would be  allowed  to  remain  beyond  the
    terms of the existing leave given.

49. The best interests of the child at the moment are to  remain  with  the
    parents.

50. Taking all the  factors  into  account  I  find  that  because  of  the
    prospects that would face this family on return to  Ghana,  because  of
    the age of the child, because of the length of time that the child  has
    now been in the United Kingdom and because of the settled nature of the
    family  unit  that  the  decision  to   remove   the   child   is   not
    proportionately justified.

51. For the reasons set out above I find that the second Claimant would not
    meet the requirements of appendix FM because evidence of the income  to
    satisfy the rules has not been submitted.

52. However as I have allowed the appeal of the third  Claimant  the  child
    the second Claimant could rely upon EX1. There appear to  be  no  other
    reason to refuse the application under Appendix FM. If I  am  wrong  in
    that I would in any event have considered  Article  8  and  would  have
    found that the decision is not proportionately justified.

53. Accordingly I find that there would be a breach of the second and third
    Claimants' Article 8 rights by removing them from the  United  Kingdom.
    For the reasons set out I allow the appeals of  the  second  and  third
    Claimants.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs otherwise,  the  Claimants  are
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify them or any member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Claimants and to the Appellant.  Failure to comply  with
this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
