                            DECISION AND REASONS

    Introduction

    1. The appellant is a citizen of Sri  Lanka.  His  appeal  against  the
       decision to refuse his protection claim was dismissed by  First-tier
       Tribunal Judge NMK Lawrence in a determination  promulgated  on  the
       29th January 2019. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge of  the
       First-tier Tribunal Margaret O'Keefe on 13th  March  2019.  On  16th
       April 2019 the respondent conceded that permission should be granted
       as documents were verified by the respondent  after  the  First-tier
       Tribunal hearing  and  the  refusal  of  asylum  decision  had  been
       withdrawn on 21st February 2019, and asylum granted to the appellant
       on 4th April 2019.

    2. The respondent sought the vacation of the hearing before  the  Upper
       Tribunal  on  2nd  May  2019  in  these  circumstances,   and   this
       application was granted  by  Lawyer  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  Sukhi
       Bakhshi in  a  decision  dated  30th  April  2019.  The  appellant's
       representative did not wish to withdraw the appeal as they wished to
       seek wasted costs from the respondent. It was directed by Ms Bakhshi
       that the parties put forward their written submissions on the appeal
       being deemed abandoned under Rule  17A  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
       (Upper Tribunal) Procedure Rules 2008  and  also  on  the  issue  of
       wasted costs.

    3. I now determine these two issues.

Submissions

    4. David Benson Solicitors for the appellant argues in summary that the
       relevant original documents had been sent to the Further Submissions
       Unit in Liverpool following grant of permission for judicial  review
       of a refusal to accept further submissions as a fresh claim on  25th
       January 2018. The judicial  review  then  concluded  by  consent  in
       February 2018. The solicitors had requested that verification of the
       documents take place in correspondence with the  GLD  and  also  the
       respondent, but a new refusal of  asylum  was  issued  without  this
       having taken place in May 2018 and the appellant appealed. A further
       request for verification was made in June 2018  at  the  pre-hearing
       review in the First-tier Tribunal. On 4th July 2018  Mr  John  Smith
       appeared for the respondent at a hearing in the First-tier  Tribunal
       and agreed to  personally  ensure  that  the  document  verification
       process took place: as a result the appeal was  adjourned.  At  this
       point Counsel for the appellant raised the issue  of  wasted  costs.
       The appellant's solicitors contacted the PO Unit  in  Birmingham  on
       many occasions between July 2018 and October 2018 when the case  was
       relisted for hearing. When the  matter  was  next  listed,  on  10th
       October 2018 the verification had not taken place and the respondent
       applied to adjourn the  hearing,  and  this  granted  despite  being
       opposed by the appellant's counsel on the basis that it was proposed
       to verify via a different route, namely the NDFU, and this  was  not
       believed  to  be  the  appropriate  organisation  to   conduct   the
       verification. In January 2019 the respondent applied to adjourn  the
       hearing again on the basis  that  the  NDFU  could  not  verify  the
       documents and so there was a special request  made  and  granted  to
       carry out verification in Colombo. This request for  an  adjournment
       was refused by the caseworker and at the hearing  by  Judge  of  the
       First-tier Tribunal NKM Lawrence. It was said that the documents had
       been sent to the wrong email address and so had not been received by
       the right person at the British High Commission  and  so  a  further
       period of three weeks was required. The appellant's  Counsel  agreed
       to this adjournment request as it was for a short period.

    5. It is argued that as the appellant's solicitors have been trying  to
       ensure that the documents were verified since January 2018, and this
       was all that was needed to prove that the appellant was entitled  to
       refugee status that the respondent had acted unreasonably in failing
       to ensure  this  was  done  and  this  had  incurred  the  appellant
       considerable costs of three hearings before the First-tier  Tribunal
       and  then  in  challenging  the  decision  of  Judge  Lawrence.  The
       adjournment requests in writing were not made in  sufficient  detail
       to be granted and thus required hearings, and  there  was  an  error
       with respect to the email address. A statement of costs for  �11,155
       of solicitors' costs plus �2937.35 of counsel's fees is submitted.

    6. In reply the respondent argues that he has  behaved  reasonably  and
       competently throughout. The presenting officer had  only  undertaken
       to make his best efforts to ensure that they were verified  in  July
       2018.  There  is  no  general  duty  to  verify  documents  on   the
       respondent,   see   VT   (Article   22   Procedures   Directive    -
       confidentiality) Sri Lanka [2017] UKUT 368. It was not  unreasonable
       to have tried to verify the  documents  via  the  National  Document
       Fraud Unit in October 2018. In October 2018 directions said that the
       result of checks should be served by  17th  December  2018  and  the
       respondent sought to use the Immigration  Enforcement  International
       in Sir Lanka direct checking  option.  However,  it  was  due  to  a
       technical issue that the request was  not  received  by  this  body,
       which was not the fault of the respondent.

    7. The respondent also challenges the sum claimed. It is said that this
       is excessive and unreasonable. There is, for instance, 4  days  work
       on letters and emails to the respondent and appellant in a 10  month
       period, which is �7000. There is also work which was done  prior  to
       lodging the appeal which is outside of the proceedings.

Conclusions

    8. I am satisfied that the requirements of procedural fairness  to  the
       respondent have been complied with in dealing with this  application
       for wasted costs. I am guided by the decisions in Awuah  and  Others
       (Wasted Costs Orders) [2017] UKFtT  555  (IAC)  and  Cancino  [2015]
       UKFtT 00059. It is essential that it is shown that the wasted  costs
       were caused by the substandard behaviour of the respondent, and that
       a properly precise amount is claimed for this loss. It is  necessary
       to consider whether there is a proper explanation  for  the  conduct
       under scrutiny. On the facts of this case the  question  is  whether
       the respondent has acted unreasonably in the defence of this appeal,
       or put another way whether the presenting officers and their  fellow
       colleagues in the document verification process acted as  reasonably
       competent civil servants.

    9. I find that this is not an appropriate case to make a  wasted  costs
       order. I fully appreciate the frustration of the appellant  and  his
       solicitors who clearly worked as hard as they could to try to obtain
       the verification of the key documents through the processes  of  the
       respondent in a timely fashion. It is clear that  in  the  end  this
       process took a period of some 13 months to achieve  this.  It  would
       have been desirable if this had not  been  the  case.  However,  the
       respondent was not under a duty to verify the documents at  all.  It
       was also not a case where the respondent pursued the appeal once  he
       had the information which showed that the appellant was entitled  to
       refugee status. Attempts were made to verify the  documents  through
       different  channels,  and  one  of  the  channels,  the  final   and
       successful one, involved an IT glitch which meant that  an  overseas
       team did not receive the request  and  then  when  it  was  received
       needed more time to carry out the process as they had  to  attend  a
       court located some distance from Colombo. There were  attempts  made
       to adjourn the hearings without the parties attending the First-tier
       Tribunal but those attempts were refused by the First-tier  Tribunal
       who perhaps understandably needed to hear from the parties  directly
       to grant the adjournments.

   10. I do not believe  that  there  is  any  evidence  that  any  of  the
       presenting officers or others  involved  were  anything  other  than
       reasonably competent civil servants.  It  might  be  that  that  the
       arrangements for checking documents could be improved or streamlined
       but this might  have  resources  implications  and  so  may  not  be
       possible and I do not find that the  costs  of  the  appellant  were
       caused by unreasonable behaviour by the respondent.



          Decision:

   1. There is no order for wasted costs.
   2. The appeal is treated as finally determined under Rule 17A(1)  of  the
      Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.



    Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 (SI 2008/269) I make an anonymity order. Unless the Upper Tribunal
    or a Court directs otherwise, no report of  these  proceedings  or  any
    form of publication thereof shall directly or indirectly  identify  the
    original appellant. This direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  all
    parties. Any failure to comply with this direction could give  rise  to
    contempt of court proceedings. I do so in order to avoid  a  likelihood
    of serious harm arising to the  appellant  from  the  contents  of  his
    protection claim.
