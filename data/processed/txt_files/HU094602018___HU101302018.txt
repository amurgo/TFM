Representation:
For the appellant:     Ms S Jones, Senior Presenting Officer
For the respondent:    Mr S Karim of Counsel


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is the Secretary of State for the Home Department and the
    respondents are citizens of India born  respectively  on  30  September
    1981 and 11 November 1981  and  her  husband  and  wife.  However,  for
    convenience, I refer below to the respondents as the appellants and  to
    the Secretary of State as the respondent, which  are  the  designations
    they had before the First-tier Tribunal. I  should  also  consider  the
    first appellant's appeal because the second appellant's appeal rests or
    falls with that of the first appellant.

 2. The Secretary of State appeals with permission to  the  Upper  Tribunal
    against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Dineen promulgated on
    1 January 2019, allowing the appellants appeals against  the  decisions
    of the Secretary of State dated respectively to refuse  them  leave  to
    remain in the United Kingdom pursuant to paragraph 276B and 322  (five)
    of the immigration rules bases, on the character of the appellant which
    the respondent found to be dishonest.

 3. Permission was granted First-tier Tribunal Judge Andrew decision  dated
    8 February 2019 stating that it is arguable  that  the  Judge  did  not
    follow the guidance in R (on the application of Khan) v  the  Secretary
    of State for the Home Department (dishonesty, tax return, paragraph 322
    (5) [2018] UKUT 00384 (IAC)  when  coming  to  his  findings  that  the
    explanation given by the appellant is a plausible one.

 4. First-tier Tribunal Judge allowed the appellant's appeal and found that
    the appellant stated in his application made on 16 June 2013 that  from
    1 June 2012 to 31 May 2013 was �42 ,554.24 and  this  included  �20,780
    from self-employment. However, in his  tax  return  for  1  April  2012
    through 31 March 2013 the appellant showed that his earnings from self-
    employment were  16,054.  Therefore,  the  respondent  found  that  the
    appellant's application did not meet the  threshold  required  for  the
    Tier 1 General Migrant criteria.

 5. The judge noted that the difficulty is that the �16,054 referred to  is
    in respect of the period up to 31 March 2013 as the period in  question
    in the Tier 1 application was up to 30 May 2013. This gave rise to  the
    question as to what was by self-employment months after 31  March  2013
    which it is asserted  by  the  appellant  brought  up  a  self-employed
    receipt for the period in question from �16,054 to �20,782.

 6. Respondent's case is that nothing was earned by way of  self-employment
    in the period up to  31  May  2013  from  31  March  2013  because  the
    appellant's tax return for the year 1 April 2013 to 31 March 2014 shows
    no self-employment income. However the appellant's case as that in fact
    during that period the growth of �6000 plus a few hundred pounds by way
    of self-employment that in that particular year so far as the  HMRC  is
    concerned he completed his return, as his  accountant  who  customarily
    dealt with his returns being absent from the United  Kingdom,  that  he
    filled in his return in relation in relation to his earned income  from
    at least two sources he forgot to deal with his unearned income.

 7. The appellant provided a letter to the  HMRC  dated  30  November  2017
    stated that he has noticed that he has made  an  under  declaration  by
    leaving out a self-employment income for the year 2013 to  2014.  There
    was no reply from HMRC to that  letter  and  that  "the  appellant  can
    certainly be criticised for not pressing HMRC to provide  a  reply,  it
    may be like so many people with tax affairs he does not wish to  engage
    more than necessary with the authorities but the fact of the matter  is
    it would have been most helpful to have a reply. Suffice it to say that
    he has said in that letter amounts to a voluntary declaration that  the
    HMRC has not rejected what he has said or attempted to impose upon  him
    any penalties.

 8. Thus the appellant says that the figure of  �42,554  for  the  year  in
    question at the time of the Tier  1  application  is  correct  that  he
    provided  documentation  to  support  that  figure.  The   respondent's
    response is that this is not an account which can be  accepted  because
    there is no further confirmation from HMRC that the  figures  dated  is
    accepted by them.

 9. The initial burden of  proof  is  on  the  respondent  which  has  been
    satisfied by producing the appellant's tax return for 2013 to 2014.  In
    the case of Khan it  is  stated  that  where  there  is  a  significant
    difference between the income claimed in the previous  application  for
    leave to remain in the income declared to HMRC, the Secretary of  State
    is entitled to draw an inference of the applicant has been deceitful or
    dishonest. The Judge reminded himself that  although  the  standard  of
    proof of the respondent is the balance of probability, finding  that  a
    person has been deceitful and dishonest in relation to his tax  affairs
    with the consequences that he is denied settlement of the country is  a
    very serious finding with serious consequences.

10.  The  Judge  found  that  in  all  the  circumstances  the  appellant's
    explanation that he left out self-employed earnings in the year 2013 to
    2014 tax return is at least plausible. The judge  found  the  appellant
    truthful he stated that he has realised his error has  taken  steps  to
    remedy it. The letter written to HMRC is a  step  within  a  reasonable
    timeframe even if it  took  the  steps  after  being  prompted  by  the
    respondent in relation to his  financial  affairs  of  the  application
    leading to this appeal. The  appellant  acted  quickly  upon  being  so
    prompted and in all the circumstances the judge was satisfied that  the
    burden of proof in relation to this serious matter has  been  satisfied
    in a finding of this honesty of bad character. The  Judge  allowed  the
    appeal on human rights grounds.

Grounds of appeal

11. The respondent's grounds of appeal which I summarise are the following.
    The appellant's applications for indefinite leave under paragraph  276B
    of the immigration rules was refused under paragraph  322  (5)  of  the
    immigration rules. This was due to the discrepancies in the appellant's
    declared income to HMRC for tax purposes and the UKVI  in  his  further
    leave applications.

12. The first-tier Tribunal Judge failed to follow  the  reasoning  of  the
    upper Tribunal in the case of R (on the application  of  Khan)  of  the
    Secretary of State for the Home  Department  (dishonesty,  tax  return,
    paragraph 322 (5) [2018] UKUT 00384 (IAC) when  assessing  whether  the
    appellant cited dishonesty relations to his dealings UKVI or HMRC.

13. The First-tier Tribunal Judge did not follow the recommended  steps  in
    Khan when assessing the appellant's  actions  and  absolved  the  first
    appellant of any responsibility to ensure his tax returns are  correct.
    The Judge has not provided reasons for why  it  is  accepted  that  the
    appellant would not have been aware of the errors sooner given that his
    tax liability would have been significantly  lower  than  it  has  been
    previously or subsequently. In addition the Judge has not  factored  in
    the delay in the appellant remedy the situation,  given  that  he  only
    sought to address this apply for indefinite  leave  to  remain  several
    years later. Even then it was only undertaken  following  prompting  by
    the respondent.

14. The Judge notes at paragraph  7  in  his  decision  that  there  is  no
    documentary evidence that demonstrates  that  HMRC  has  resolved  this
    issue with the first appellant. If the judge fully consider the factors
    in the head note of Khan the outcome of  the  appeal  would  have  been
    different.

15. The Judge has failed to  give  reasons  or  any  adequate  reasons  for
    finding on material matters. At paragraph 12 the Judge states  that  he
    accepts the explanation given by the appellant for why he left out self-
    employment only the year 2013 to 2014 tax return is at least plausible.
    The  Judge  has  failed  to  provide  adequate  reasons  for  why   the
    explanation given by the appellant for his  failure  to  declare  self-
    employment found  to  be  plausible.  In  addition  response  has  been
    received from HMRC and therefore without that evidence it is  not  sure
    that the appellant has actually remitted the discrepancy. The Judge has
    failed to provide adequate reasons for this finding of fact.

The hearing

16. At the hearing both parties make submissions whether there is an  error
    of law.

Findings as to whether there is an error of law

17. There  was  no  dispute  that  there  was  a  discrepancy  between  the
    appellant's income which was declared to HMRC in his  tax  returns  and
    the income that he declared to UKVI for his  further  leave  to  remain
    application. The appellant left out self-employed earnings in the  year
    2013 to 2014 tax return.

18. The Judge into account the case of Khan as to how to assess cases where
    they are discrepancies between the income  declared  to  HMRC  and  the
    income declared to the respondent for  his  previous  application.  The
    Judge clearly found that the respondent had discharged  his  burden  of
    proof. Therefore, it was for the Judge to analyse the evidence and find
    whether there was an innocent explanation for the discrepancy.

19. The Judge within the  guidance  given  in  Khan  analysed  whether  the
    explanation for  the  error  of  not  declaring  himself  earnings  was
    plausible, whether any documents which can be assumed to exist such  as
    correspondence between the applicant his accountant at the time of  the
    tax return has been disclosed. He also has to assess whether there is a
    plausible explanation for why such documentation is missing. The  Judge
    also has to assess why the appellant did not realise the  error  sooner
    because his liability to pay tax was less than he should have  expected
    and whether at any stage have been taken steps to remedy the  situation
    and, if so, when the steps were  taken  and  the  explanation  for  any
    significant delay.

20. The Judge who is a very senior judge and in  a  very  careful  decision
    analysed the evidence and  came  to  his  reasoned  conclusion  on  the
    evidence in the  appeal.  He  found  the  appellant  credible  and  his
    explanation credible and plausible. He referred to the case of Khan and
    therefore guided himself appropriately.

21. The Judge found that the appellant rectified his tax returns  once  the
    respondent referred to discrepancy in his reasons for refusal letter. A
    letter to HMRC dated 30 November 2017 was considered by  the  Judge  to
    demonstrate that the appellant had under declared  his  self-employment
    earnings to rectify the error made. The Judge found that  he  does  not
    take against the appellant that  he  only  attempted  to  rectify  once
    prompted by  the  respondent.  The  Judge  found  that  that  voluntary
    declaration which the HMRC has not rejected or attempted to impose upon
    him any penalties.

22. The fact that the HMRC does not impose penalties  is  neither  here  or
    there as set out in the decision of the  Upper  Tribunal  the  judicial
    review case of R (on the application of Samat) v Secretary of State for
    the Home Department [2017] UKAIT  JR  and  Abbasi  JR/13807/2016  where
    there were findings relating to the relevance of the actions that  HMRC
    makes against a person. It states that there are  several  reasons  why
    HMRC would not take action against a particular person and that  should
    not go in favour of the appellant.

23. Therefore, the treatment of applicants by HMRC is not relevant  to  322
    (5) assessments. The Judge however did not take the fact that the  HMRC
    has not imposed penalties the appellant into account in favour  of  the
    appellant and therefore did not fall into material error that regard.

24. I find that the Judge  has  given  reasons  for  why  he  believed  the
    appellant's explanation after hearing the appeal  and  considering  the
    evidence, documents and the arguments. The Judge was right to  consider
    that a finding that a  person  has  been  deceitful  and  dishonest  in
    relation to his tax affairs with the  consequence  that  he  is  denied
    settlement in this country is  a  very  serious  finding  with  serious
    consequences. The more serious the allegation or the more  serious  the
    consequences if the allegation is proved,  the  stronger  must  be  the
    evidence before a court will find the allegation proved on the  balance
    of probabilities.

25. R (N) v Mental Health Review Tribunal (Northern Region) [2005] EWCA Civ
    1605, [2006] QB 468) Richards LJ stated at paragraph 62  that "Although
    there  is  a  single  civil  standard  of  proof  on  the  balance   of
    probabilities, it is flexible in its application. Thus the  flexibility
    of the standard lies not in any adjustment to the degree of probability
    required for an allegation to be  proved  (such  that  a  more  serious
    allegation has to be proved to a higher degree of probability), but  in
    the strength or quality of  the  evidence  that  will  in  practice  be
    required  for  an  allegation  to  be  proved   on   the   balance   of
    probabilities."

26. The consequences to the appellant and his wife were  serious  and  that
    they have lived in this country for 10  years  and  their  applications
    were only refused under the provisions of  paragraph  322  (5)  of  the
    immigration rules in respect of character and conduct.

27. The grounds of appeal are no more than a quarrel with the  findings  of
    the first-tier Tribunal Judge by all accounts has  considered  all  the
    evidence carefully and I cannot find a material error of law.




    Decision

28. The appeal by the Secretary of State is dismissed and the decision of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge stands.
