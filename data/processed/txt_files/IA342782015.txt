Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appellant's  appeal  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Maxwell promulgated 13.9.16, dismissing on  all  grounds
    his appeal against the  decision  of  the  Secretary  of  State,  dated
    11.11.15, to refuse his application made on 29.9.14 for LTR as a Tier 4
    Student.

 2. The Judge heard the appeal on 22.8.16.

 3. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Parkes  refused  permission  to  appeal  on
    13.1.17. However,  when  the  application  was  renewed  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal, Upper Tribunal Judge Gill granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    21.2.17.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 24.4.17 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. For the reasons summarised below, I found such  error  of  law  in  the
    making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal such  as  to  require
    the decision of Judge Maxwell to be set aside and remade afresh.

 6. The appellant first came to the UK on with entry  clearance  issued  on
    30.4.11, valid until 30.9.14.

 7. On 19.1.15 the appellant's application for LTR  as  a  Tier  4  student
    migrant was  refused.  It  was  refused  because  his  Confirmation  of
    Acceptance for Studies (CAS).  issued  by  Queensbury  College  was  no
    longer valid. That institution's licence as an educational sponsor  was
    revoked on 18.8.14, invalidating the CAS issued to the appellant.

 8. However, his appeal against that decision was allowed by the First-tier
    Tribunal on  6.8.15,  on  the  basis  that  the  decision  was  not  in
    accordance with the law and that it remained for the Secretary of State
    to make a decision. The Tribunal directed that the appellant be granted
    60 days to find a fresh educational sponsor.

 9. Following the appeal, the Home Office wrote to the appellant on 4.9.15,
    agreeing to suspend further consideration  of  his  application  for  a
    period of 60 days, and invited him to either withdraw  his  application
    or obtain a new CAS for study in the UK with  an  approved  educational
    sponsor.

10. By 11.11.15, beyond the 60-day period allowed, the  appellant  had  not
    submitted any new CAS. The period in fact  ended  on  3.11.15.  In  the
    circumstances, the application was doomed to failure and it was refused
    under paragraph 322(9) of the Immigration Rules, a  general  ground  of
    refusal. In addition, it was refused  under  paragraph  245ZX,  because
    without a valid CAS the appellant could not qualify for  the  necessary
    points under Appendix A of the Rules.

11. The grounds of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal were that the decision
    of the Secretary of State was not  in  accordance  with  the  law.  The
    appellant's dilemma is explained in his letter  of  1.11.15.  Following
    his successful appeal, he obtained a place at  the  London  College  of
    Advanced Management, paying a fee of ï¿½2,500.  However,  that  college's
    licence was also revoked. He was unable to recover  the  fee  paid.  He
    applied to yet another college, but the new course was not due to start
    until January 2016 and they would not grant him a CAS  because  it  did
    not start within 28 days of the  expiry  of  his  permission  to  stay,
    pursuant to the requirements of the policy guidance.

12. Judge Maxwell heard the appeal in  the  absence  of  representation  on
    behalf of either the appellant or the  respondent.  The  appellant  had
    written  to  the  Tribunal  seeking  an  adjournment,  because  he  had
    "important liver surgery," due to take place  on  the  listed  day  for
    hearing. He also stated that in the event the  adjournment  application
    was refused, he wanted the appeal to be  decided  on  the  papers.  The
    adjournment application  was  refused  in  the  absence  of  supporting
    medical evidence.

13. Judge Maxwell considered that the latter refusal decision  of  11.11.15
    was wrong to suggest that the appellant had a right of  appeal  against
    the refusal. Judge Maxwell stated, "The earlier application is  decided
    and the failure of the appellant to respond means there is, in fact  no
    application for the respondent to consider. As there is no application,
    there is no immigration decision and therefore no valid  appeal  before
    me." In that light,  the  Judge  considered  that  there  could  be  no
    advantage in adjourning the hearing, as, in  his  view,  there  was  no
    valid appeal.

14. As Judge Gill pointed out as  arguable  in  her  reasons  for  granting
    permission to appeal, when the Secretary of State  reconsidered  afresh
    the appellant's application of September 2014, the  decision  contained
    within the letter of 11.11.15, together with the decision to remove him
    from the UK by directions, was a decision on the  appellant's  original
    application of 29.9.14.

15. The Rule 24 reply of the Secretary of State, dated 17.3.17, states that
    her view is that the decision of 11.11.15 was an  immigration  decision
    in relation to the application of 29.9.14, and a  decision  within  the
    meaning of section 82, giving rise to a right of appeal.

16. By the terms  of  the  previous  appeal  decision  of  Judge  Beg,  the
    application  remained  outstanding,  not  validly  decided,   with   no
    immigration decision. In effect, the decision had been  set  aside.  It
    follows that the Secretary  of  State  was  entitled  to  and  in  fact
    required to make a (fresh) decision on that application.  I  find  that
    it qualifies as a decision under section 82 of the  2002  Act,  against
    which a right of appeal was preserved under the transitional provisions
    made by the amendment to section 82 by the Immigration  Act  2014.  The
    appellant had a right of appeal, which he duly  exercised.  It  follows
    that Judge Maxwell's decision, finding that the  application  had  been
    decided and thus nothing for the Secretary to consider was  wrong.  The
    conclusion that there was no jurisdiction to  hear  the  matter  was  a
    clear error of law.

17. Whilst there was a right of appeal, it is clear that the  appeal  could
    not succeed, for the simple reason that the appellant submitted no  new
    valid CAS before the decision of 11.11.15,  or  in  fact  at  any  time
    since.

18. However, as Judge Maxwell erred in law on the  issue  of  jurisdiction,
    the appellant's leave still continues under section 3C of the 1971  Act
    until such time as  there  is  a  lawful  decision  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal. Judge Gill additionally granted permission  on  this  ground.
    This may give the appellant further time to obtain a valid CAS, as  his
    leave continues under section 3C, and make a new application.  However,
    that is a matter for the appellant.

19. Judge Gill did not grant permission on  the  grounds  relating  to  the
    issue of fairness. No matter whether there were failings on the part of
    his previous representatives, the fact remains  that  he  submitted  no
    valid CAS. The Tribunal does not have the  power  to  allow  an  appeal
    against the decision of 11.11.15 notwithstanding that he did not submit
    a valid CAS. There is no basis to dispense with that  requirement.  Any
    unfairness arising as a result of failings by his legal representatives
    cannot render the decision of the Secretary of  State  unlawful.  These
    grounds were not renewed before me and I address them no further.

Remittal

20. When a decision of the First-tier Tribunal has been set aside,  section
    12(2) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 requires either
    that the case is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal  with  directions,
    or it must be remade by the Upper Tribunal. The scheme of the Tribunals
    Court and Enforcement Act 2007 does not assign the function of  primary
    fact finding to the Upper Tribunal. I considered  immediately  remaking
    the decision at the hearing  on  24.4.17.  However,  in  light  of  the
    appellant's complaint that he has not been given a fair opportunity  to
    obtain a CAS, I acceded to the submission that remittal to  the  First-
    tier Tribunal would be appropriate, to allow him at least a  chance  of
    pursuing study in the UK with a valid CAS.

21. In all the circumstances, at the invitation and request of both parties
    to relist this appeal for a fresh hearing in the First-tier Tribunal, I
    do so on the basis that this is a case which falls squarely within  the
    Senior President's Practice Statement at paragraph 7.2. The  effect  of
    the error has been to deprive the appellant of a fair hearing.  I  find
    that it is appropriate to remit this appeal to the First-tier  Tribunal
    to determine the appeal afresh.

Conclusions:

22. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should  be
    set aside.

     I set aside the decision.

                    I remit the appeal to be decided afresh  in  the  First-
                    tier Tribunal.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.




Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The outcome of the appeal remains to be decided.
