                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal against a determination by  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    (Judge Kempton) that was promulgated on 4  August  2014,  but  did  not
    actually reach the appellant until 7 August.   That  determination  was
    made on the papers at the appellant's own request. His  appeal  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal was dismissed.

 2. The appellant was appealing against the refusal by  the  respondent  to
    grant him a residence card as the family member  of  an  EEA  national,
    namely his daughter, who is of Portuguese  nationality  and  exercising
    her Treaty rights to work in the UK.  The Home Office  letter  refusing
    the application had set out in some detail  what  was  required  to  be
    shown under Regulation 71C of the Immigration (European Economic  Area)
    Regulations 2006. The appellant was told that the  regulation  required
    dependent direct relatives in the  ascending  line  (i.e.  parents)  to
    provide evidence of dependency on the sponsor in the UK either  in  the
    form of financial  dependency  or  joint  residency.   His  application
    failed because he had failed to provide  such  evidence  (under  either
    limb), and in particular because the Home Office had seen  no  evidence
    of his residency other than a bare assertion by him that he  had  lived
    in the UK for over five years, having entered  clandestinely  in  2008.
    Although he had submitted originals and copies of bank  statements  for
    his daughter in support of his application, it was said that  they  did
    not evidence his ability to have access to funds.

 3. The First-tier Tribunal came to exactly  the  same  conclusion  as  the
    respondent that there was insufficient evidence of dependency.  We  are
    satisfied that the Tribunal adequately explained why that decision  was
    reached, and why it was that the various documents that were  submitted
    by the appellant did not suffice[9-12].

 4. Permission to appeal was granted on the basis that it was arguable that
    the Tribunal did not sufficiently consider the question  of  dependency
    as from August 2013. August 2013 is a key date,  because  although  the
    evidence as to the sponsor's financial resources  prior  to  that  date
    tended to suggest she could not have afforded to give financial support
    to her father, in August 2013 she took up a new job which, on the  face
    of it, suggested that she might at least have been able to afford to do
    so in future.

 5. The documentary evidence before the Tribunal showed  that  the  sponsor
    was offered a position as a PA and  administrative  assistant  with  an
    organisation called Management To Learn Ltd at a salary of ï¿½25,000  per
    annum with a starting date of 1 August 2013, and that she had  accepted
    that job. There were also copies of her bank statements  from  Barclays
    Bank which showed  that  her  new  employers  were  paying  her  salary
    regularly into her bank account, at least as from October 2013[9-10].

 6. The same bank statements showed that there were two  payments  made  to
    her father in the course of December 2013 from the same  bank  account,
    and that there were other payments made to  him  from  the  account  in
    January 2014.  They are  not  insignificant  sums  of  money,  but  the
    duration of the payments and the amounts that  were  paid,  in  and  of
    themselves, fall a long way short of showing that  he  was  financially
    dependent upon her.

 7. There is nothing in the Regulation to indicate how  long  a  period  of
    financial dependency has to be shown by an applicant, and in particular
    whether that period should coincide with the period that the  applicant
    (or the sponsor) has been within the  jurisdiction.  However,  even  if
    financial dependency for the purposes of the Regulation can be  over  a
    relatively short period, and even if it can relate to a time  which  is
    (a)  shorter  than  the  period  the  applicant  has  been  within  the
    jurisdiction and (b) shorter than the time that the  sponsor  has  been
    exercising his or her Treaty  rights  in  the  UK,  it  is  clear  that
    something more than some isolated payments made by the sponsor  to  the
    applicant is required.

 8. Whilst the  Tribunal  did  not  specifically  make  findings  that  the
    evidence of the isolated payments made to the appellant by his daughter
    in December 2013 and January  2014  was  insufficient  to  satisfy  the
    requirements of the regulation, we find no material  error  of  law  in
    this regard.

 9. There was no evidence before the  Tribunal  as  to  how  the  appellant
    managed before he was getting those payments. There is  no  documentary
    evidence of his receiving any payments from  his  daughter  before  she
    took on the new job, and as we have already stated,  such  evidence  as
    there was suggested that there was insufficient money  coming  in  from
    her previous employment to enable her to pay for his upkeep as well  as
    her own.

10. The Tribunal found  that  there  was  no  evidence  to  show  that  the
    appellant actually lived with his daughter.  [10]  It  found  that  the
    evidence of an invoice for a firm of solicitors, a letter  from  Virgin
    Media and telephone bills was inadequate to establish  that he lives in
    the same house  as  his  daughter.  The  appellant  adduced  a  witness
    statement from his daughter but what the Tribunal found lacking was any
    independent evidence of the social and financial  circumstances  beyond
    the bank statements [12].

11. All the evidence was  scrutinised  very  carefully  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal. There was no  obligation  on  the  Tribunal  to  accept  bare
    assertions of dependency made in the witness statements.

12. In short, although there was an argument that the  First-tier  Tribunal
    failed to make findings in relation to the period after the appellant's
    daughter took on the new job which gave her more  money  than  she  had
    previously earned, and thus potentially gave her the means  to  provide
    some financial  assistance  to  her  father,  in  our  judgment  it  is
    impossible to argue that the decision was  irrational  or  inadequately
    reasoned  on  that  ground.  Even  if  the  Tribunal  had  specifically
    addressed the position after August 2013, instead  of  looking  at  the
    totality of the evidence, it would  have  made  no  difference  to  the
    outcome of the determination.

13. The judge giving permission to appeal also said there was  an  arguable
    case that the First-tier Tribunal reached an irrational or inadequately
    reasoned finding that there was no evidence to  show  that  he  resided
    with his daughter and in concluding that Article 8 was not engaged.  We
    respectfully disagree. The evidence in relation to where the  appellant
    was living at any given  time  was  thin  in  the  extreme,  and  there
    certainly was insufficient evidence for the Tribunal to  conclude  that
    he was living at the same address as  his  daughter  either  before  or
    after August 2013. There is no error in the reasoning or the clarity of
    the finding that was made in that regard. It was  a  finding  that  was
    plainly open to the Tribunal.

14. To the extent that this ground is pursued on appeal, we find that there
    is no substance in it.

15.  However, the main point taken by the appellant is that  there  was  an
    insufficient consideration of the question of financial dependency.  So
    far as that is concerned we consider that the evidence before the First-
    tier Tribunal fell a long way short  of  showing  financial  dependency
    either before or after August 2013. The Tribunal did give the matter of
    dependency  adequate  consideration  and  was  entitled  to  reach  the
    decision that it did on the evidence before it.

Decision

16. There was no material error of law in that determination on any of  the
    grounds for which permission to appeal was granted.  For those  reasons
    we dismiss this appeal.


No anonymity direction is made.
