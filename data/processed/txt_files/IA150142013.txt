The Upper Tribunal
(Immigration and Asylum Chamber)        Appeal number: IA/15014/2013


                            THE IMMIGRATION ACTS

                                   Before

                       UPPER TRIBUNAL JUDGE KOPIECZEK



                                   Between

                            NANCY AFRIYIE NTIFORO
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent

                                  DECISION
   1. The appellant has an appeal outstanding before the Upper Tribunal.  By
      letter dated 27 May 2014 the  appellant  states  that  she  wishes  to
      withdraw her appeal because she wants to make a fresh application.

   2. Rule 17 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 provides
      that a party may give notice of the withdrawal of its case or any part
      of it, subject to the consent of  the  Upper  Tribunal.  There  is  no
      provision for  a  party  to  withdraw  the  appeal  before  the  Upper
      Tribunal. Therefore, the letter from the appellant can serve only as a
      notice of withdrawal of her case before the Upper Tribunal,  to  which
      the Upper Tribunal now consents.

   3.  Accordingly,  the  appellant's  appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal   is
      dismissed. The decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  to  dismiss  the
      appeal therefore stands.
