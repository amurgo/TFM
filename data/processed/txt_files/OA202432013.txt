Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr B. Ali, Solicitor Advocate instructed by Stoke &
White LLP
For the Respondent:    Mr N. Bramble, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appellant

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Turkey, born on  26  November  1973,  who
    applied for entry clearance to the United Kingdom to establish  a  hair
    dressing  business  under  the  Turkey-European  Community  Association
    Agreement.

 2. In a decision  dated  10  October  2013,  the  respondent  refused  the
    application. The refusal notice stipulated  that  the  appellant  could
    only appeal on human rights grounds. The appellant nonetheless appealed
    on the basis that the respondent's decision was not in accordance  with
    the Immigration Rules, as well as being incompatible  with  his  rights
    under the European Convention on Human Rights.

 3. The appeal came before First-tier Tribunal Judge M  P  W  Harris  ("the
    judge") on 29 January 2015. The appellant did  not  advance  any  human
    rights arguments and sought only to argue that the decision was not  in
    accordance with the Immigration Rules. In a decision promulgated on  13
    February 2015, the judge dismissed the appellant's appeal on the  basis
    that he did not have  jurisdiction  to  decide  the  appeal  under  the
    Immigration Rules. He explained his reasoning at paragraphs 11 and 12:

         "11. For the appellant's argument about having the right to  appeal
         on the ground that the decision is not in accordance with the Rules
         to succeed, I find that at the  least  he  needs  to  identify  the
         existence of a right of appeal in 1973  that  would  allow  him  to
         challenge a refusal of entry clearance under the rules.

         12.  At the time of the Standstill Clause taking effect, the appeal
         rights existing to the equivalent of the First-tier  Tribunal  were
         those contained in the Immigration Act 1971,  particularly  as  set
         out in Part 2 of the Act. However, as the case has been put  before
         me, I am not satisfied that the appellant has identified that under
         the 1971 Act a person refused entry clearance had a right of appeal
         in 1973."

 4. The appellant, in his application for permission to appeal, argued that
    the judge had made a material error of law in failing to recognise that
    he had a right of appeal under the  Immigration  Act  1971  ("the  1971
    Act"). Permission was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge McCartney on
    14 May 2015.

The Upper Tribunal Hearing

Error of Law

 5. Having heard submissions by Mr  Ali,  for  the  appellant,  and  by  Mr
    Bramble, for the respondent, we announced our decision at  the  hearing
    that the judge had made a material error of law in finding that he  did
    not have jurisdiction to hear the appeal. Our reasons are as follows.

 6. Turkish nationals, such as the appellant, can rely on Article 41(1)  of
    the Additional Protocol to the EEC -Turkish Association Agreement ("the
    Ankara Agreement"), under which the UK must  refrain  from  introducing
    any new restrictions on the freedom of  establishment  and  freedom  to
    provide services on Turkish nationals. In other words,  the  UK  cannot
    impose conditions for business appellant's from Turkey  that  are  less
    favourable then those which were in force when the UK became  bound  by
    the Ankara Agreement on 1 January 1973. Article 41(1),  known  as  "the
    standstill clause",  applies  to  procedural  as  well  as  substantive
    conditions  governing  entry  into  the  UK.  See  C-16/05  R  (on  the
    application of Veli Tum and Mehmet Dari v SSHD) ("Article 41(1)...is to
    be  interpreted  as   prohibiting   the   introduction...of   any   new
    restrictions on the exercise of  freedom  of  establishment,  including
    those  relating  to  the  substantive  and/or   procedural   conditions
    governing first admission...")

 7. The appeal rights that would have applied to the appellant on 1 January
    1973 are those set out in Part II of the 1971 Act.   Section  13(2)  of
    Part II of the 1971 Act provides as follows:

         "Subject to the provisions of this Part of this Act, a person  who,
         on an application duly made is refused a certificate of  patriality
         or an entry clearance may appeal  to  an  adjudicator  against  the
         refusal"

 8. It is clear that the appellant had a right of appeal under this section
    of the 1971 Act. Accordingly, the decision of the judge that he did not
    have jurisdiction to decide the appeal was  a  material  error  of  law
    which must be set aside.

 9. Both parties told us they were ready for us to remake the decision  and
    we therefore proceeded to do so.

The Remade Decision

The Respondent's Decision of 10 October 2013

10. On 10 October 2013 the respondent refused the  appellant's  application
    for  entry  clearance  to  establish  a  hair  dressing  business.  The
    respondent did not accept the business proposal was genuine  or  viable
    and the following reasons for refusal were given:

          a. The appellant was unable at interview to provide specific
             details of the business plan

          b. He was unable to provided evidence as to the financial costs
             in running the business

          c. His current business in Turkey had not declared any profits in
             the previous financial year and he had not explained why the
             UK business would be more successful

          d. He had not identified a specific business he proposed to
             purchase

          e. He had not satisfactorily researched the market or running of
             a business and was unable at interview to comment on the
             market

          f. He could not speak English and it was unclear how he could run
             the business by relying on an English and Turkish speaking
             employee and he had not sought to improve his English before
             relocating

          g. He had not provided evidence of his spouse's personal or
             financial circumstances in order to explain how she would be
             able to support him

          h. He had not provided sufficient evidence of the source of funds
             deposited into his account or explained them given their
             inconsistency with his present business' profits

          i. He had not explained his expected costs of running the
             business and living in the UK and provided evidence that the
             profit will be sufficient to support him and his dependents

The Appellant's Submissions

11. Mr Ali  relied  upon  his  skeleton  argument.  He  observed  that  the
    respondent had three heads of  refusal:  that  the  appellant  was  not
    genuinely setting up a business; that he would not be able to bear  the
    liabilities of the proposed business;  and  that  there  would  not  be
    sufficient profits. Mr  Ali  stressed  that  the  appellant's  proposed
    business must be considered in the proper context - that  he  was  only
    intending to establish a small one man hairdressing business -  and  we
    should not lose sight of this when considering the  business  plan  and
    preparation undertaken by and on behalf of the appellant.

12. Mr Ali submitted that the  appellant  had  appropriately  answered  the
    questions put to him by the respondent and had a viable  and  realistic
    business plan supported by evidence. The appellant  was  serious  about
    setting up the business and had taken advice from, and had  a  business
    plan prepared by, lawyers. Mr Ali proceeded  to  take  us  through  the
    business plan.

13. The business plan provides that the appellant will purchase a leasehold
    premises for a hairdressing salon in North or East London and, at least
    initially, he will serve primarily the Turkish community in London.  He
    will be a sole trader and will hire on a part time basis  an  assistant
    who speaks both English and Turkish on minimum wage.  The  plan  states
    that he has access to funds amounting to up to �60,000,  comprising  of
    �20,000 in cash, �30,000 from the sale of a property and  �10,000  from
    the sale of his car. The plan calculates a total start  up  requirement
    of �19,459. The plan provides that the employee cost will be  �6,239  a
    year and his drawings will be �11,000 a year for the first three  years
    of the business. Sales forecasts are given  as  �45,410  in  the  first
    year, increasing annually by 7-15%  based  on  an  assumption  he  will
    provide services to 86 clients at approximately �900 a week.  The  plan
    shows a net profit of between �5,000 and �6,000 annually in  the  first
    three years.  Mr Ali commented that the projections and assumptions are
    reasonable and that there is no reasonable basis to  dispute  them.  He
    noted they had not been  directly  challenged.  The  start  up  funding
    leaves more than enough  money  for  ongoing  costs,  given  the  funds
    available to the appellant.

14. Mr Ali drew to our attention the annexes to  the  business  plan  which
    included print outs from  the  internet  showing  a  quote  for  public
    liability insurance, course fees at the East London School of  English,
    rooms for rent in Bethnal  Green,  London  and  the  surrounding  area,
    pricing for flyers at Vistaprint, advertising costs in Haber (a Turkish
    language paper) and brief information on three barber shops  for  sale,
    printed from the websites Gumtree.com and ukbusinessesforsale.com.  One
    of the barber shops is on Cricklewood Broadway (North West London)  and
    has a price of �15,000; another is in South  East  London  (no  further
    information on the location is given) and priced at  �15,000,  and  the
    other is priced at �13,999 and in the Bethnal Green (East London) area.
    Mr Ali submitted that the annexes supported and  were  consistent  with
    the figures used in the  business  plan.  They  also  showed  that  the
    appellant had  thought  about  the  need  to  learn  English  and  find
    inexpensive accommodation

15. Mr Ali submitted that the availability of funds to  the  appellant  had
    been established with sufficient and appropriate evidence. He  referred
    to paragraphs 13-15 of the  appellant's  witness  statement  where  the
    available funding is explained. He noted the supporting evidence in the
    form of statements from banks and a letter from the appellant's wife in
    which she confirmed she had given her husband 42,885.42  Turkish  lira,
    the equivalent of �12,0147, and that she had a further �12,572  in  GBP
    accounts that were available for him. He  noted  the  letter  from  her
    employer  confirming  her  employment  and  salary.  In  addition,  the
    appellant had over 20,000 Turkish lira in his name, as evidenced  by  a
    letter  from  HSBC  and  bank  statements.   Accordingly,   there   was
    appropriate evidence to support the appellant's  ability  to  fund  the
    proposed business.

16. Mr Ali acknowledged that whilst the appellant's lack of  English  might
    make setting up a business more difficult,  it  by  no  means  made  it
    impossible.  The business plan took this into account by  allowing  for
    the hiring of a worker who speaks English. The  proposed  business  was
    straight forward and the worker would be able to assist  the  appellant
    as necessary. The nature of the work did not require a good command  of
    English.

17. In sum, the appellant's position, as articulated by Mr Ali, was that he
    had a reasonable and well thought out business proposal that  could  be
    properly funded by available funds.

The Respondent's Submissions

18. Mr Bramble referred to the Entry Clearance Officer's decision which  he
    thought set out reasonable and real concerns. He  noted  in  particular
    the appellant's lack of  English  and  the  difficulty  he  would  have
    managing a business in light of this. He submitted that  the  appellant
    is planning to start a business not join an existing one and  the  lack
    of English would make this  particularly  challenging.  Reliance  on  a
    minimum wage bilingual worker does  not  seem  realistic.   Mr  Bramble
    questioned whether the appellant had sufficient funds to cover the cost
    of living and all planned expenses such as English lessons, whilst  the
    business was starting up.  There  was  insufficient  detail  about  the
    proposed sale of the  appellant's  car  and  property.  Nor  was  there
    information about the source and continuing availability of  the  funds
    being sourced from the appellant's wife, which seem very high  relative
    to her income. Mr Bramble also submitted there had been no  explanation
    of the source of appellant's funds which  was  significant  given  they
    were inconsistent with the information provided on the profitability of
    his current business.





Findings and Reasons

19. The appellant's application must be decided under the 1972  Immigration
    Rules (HC 509 and HC510) as these were the Rules in force on 1  January
    1973. Paragraphs 30 - 32 of HC509 set out the  requirements  under  the
    1972 Rules relevant to the appellant's appeal.

         '30. Passengers who have obtained entry clearances for the purposes
         of establishing themselves in the UK in business, whether a new  or
         existing business, should be admitted for a period not exceeding 12
         months  with  a  condition  restricting  their  freedom   to   take
         employment. Passengers who are unable to present such  a  clearance
         but nevertheless seem likely to be able to satisfy the requirements
         of one of the next two paragraphs should be admitted for  a  period
         of not more than two months, with a prohibition on employment,  and
         advised to present their case to the Home Office.

         31.  For an applicant to obtain an entry clearance for this purpose
         he will need to show, if joining an established business,  that  he
         will be bringing money of his own to put into the business; that he
         will be able to bear his share of the liabilities; that  his  share
         of  the  profits  will  be  sufficient  to  support  him  and   his
         dependants; that he will be actively concerned in  the  running  of
         the business; and that there is a genuine need for his services and
         investment. The accounts of the business for  previous  years  will
         require to be produced, in order to establish the precise financial
         position. An entry clearance will not be issued  where  it  appears
         that the proposed partnership or directorship amounts to  disguised
         employment or where it seems likely that, to obtain  a  livelihood,
         the applicant will have to supplement his  business  activities  by
         employment for which a work permit is required.

         32.  If the applicant wishes to establish in business in the UK  on
         his own account, he will need to show that he will be bringing into
         the country sufficient funds  to  establish  a  business  that  can
         realistically be expected to support him and any dependants without
         recourse to employment for which a work permit is required.'

20. In applying the 1972 Rules, we are mindful that our  approach  must  be
    consistent with the law and practice in 1973. As  noted  by  the  Upper
    Tribunal in Akinci (paragraph 21 HC 510 - correct approach) [2012] UKUT
    00266 (IAC) the 1972  Rules  "are  considerably  more  favourable  with
    respect to  migration  for  business  purposes  than  those  prevailing
    today".  In EK (Ankara Agreement - 1972 Rules  -  Construction)  Turkey
    [2010]  UKUT  425  (IAC)  the  Upper  Tribunal   made   the   following
    observations.

         "23. In 1973 the Rules themselves were an open textured exercise in
         discretion in the round having regard to the general policy and
         particular factors identified; so was the practice in applying them
         ...

         24.  ... It was certainly the case in 1972 and for a number of
         years thereafter that the Home Office recognised that a business
         often needed some time to turn a profit and losses in the early
         years were not inconsistent with a business that met the policy and
         purposes of the Rules in general. The case was always considered in
         the round."

21. The appellant must discharge the burden of proof and  the  standard  of
    proof is the balance of probabilities.

22. We have taken into account all of the evidence presented  including  in
    particular the appellant's business plan, the supporting  evidence  for
    the plan, the evidence of available funds and the  appellant's  witness
    statement.

23. In assessing whether the appellant meets the requirements in  HC509  we
    have kept in mind that the 1972 Rules  were  far  less  stringent  than
    those applying to  businessmen  under  the  current  Immigration  Rules
    HC395.

24. Having considered all of the evidence in the round, we  find  that  the
    appellant has not met the requirements of the 1972 Rules and  therefore
    his appeal should be dismissed. Our reasons are as follows.

25. We are not satisfied that the appellant has demonstrated  how  he  will
    overcome the difficulty of running his own business whilst not speaking
    English. In his business plan he says he will be employing  an  English
    speaking part time employee paid �6.19 an hour for 18 hours a week.  Mr
    Ali has submitted that this  employee  will  be  able  to  assist  with
    managing  and  running  the  business.  Based  on  the   evidence   and
    submissions, we find that the appellant has not properly considered and
    thought out how his business can and will be viable when  he  does  not
    speak English. Had he been joining an existing business, or had he been
    able to rely on a support network of family and friends  to  assist  in
    administration and management, his lack of English  might  more  easily
    have been overcome. However, we do not accept that the appellant's plan
    of relying on a part time minimum wage bilingual employee is  one  that
    has been sufficiently developed for us to accept that the business plan
    is a genuine and realistic one. Accordingly, we do not accept that  the
    business, as proposed, is one that can  realistically  be  expected  to
    support the appellant.

26. We have carefully considered the business plan and  are  not  satisfied
    that it represents a genuine and individually thought out plan  by  the
    appellant to set up a business in the  UK  that  he  will  be  able  to
    successfully manage given his lack of English. The appellant  has  said
    that he proposes to serve the Turkish community in the UK but there  is
    no indication that the appellant proposes to locate the business  in  a
    predominantly Turkish part of London - on the contrary, the plan refers
    to the hair dressing salon being in "North  or  East  London"  and  the
    three premises annexed to the plan are all in different parts of London
    rather than concentrated in an area that  might  be  suitable  for  the
    targeted demographic. There is no indication  that  the  appellant  has
    carried out market research or has an understanding of  the  market  in
    which he would operate. In his witness statement he indicates  that  he
    has relied on professional advisors (by which we presume he  means  his
    solicitors) for this.  The annual  costing  for  an  employee  of  only
    �6,239 seems entirely insufficient when the appellant will be dependent
    on  this  employee  for  English  language  communication.  The   sales
    forecasts in the business plan also seem questionable. They  are  based
    on an assumption that he will earn approximately �900 a  week.  One  of
    the three barber shops whose brief details  are  annexed  to  the  plan
    refers to average weekly takings of �650-�850; another refers to weekly
    turnover of �636. The third shop does not give a figure. The  appellant
    has not explained why it is reasonable for him to forecast that he will
    have  higher  weekly  takings.  Nor  does  his   forecast   appear   to
    sufficiently take into account that his takings  may  be  substantially
    lower in the first several months of operating the business.

27.  The  cost  of  setting  up  the  business  will  be  substantial.  The
    appellant's assumed start up funding requirement, as  set  out  in  the
    business plan, is �19,459. In addition, he will need to fund his living
    costs (accommodation, food etc) along with English language classes. It
    is not clear how long the appellant will be in the UK before he locates
    suitable premises  and  starts  operating  and  making  a  profit.  The
    appellant's  capital  requirements   are   therefore   likely   to   be
    substantially more  than  �19,459.   We  are  not  satisfied  that  the
    appellant will be bringing into the UK sufficient funds to cover these.
    Based on the appellant's evidence, the funds in his name amount to less
    than �7,000. To make up the shortfall, the appellant is  reliant  on  a
    significant transfer from his wife and/or the sale of assets  of  which
    we have been provided very little information. The appellant's wife has
    written a letter in which she confirms she has almost �25,000 available
    to support her husband. She  states  that  this  will  not  affect  her
    financial situation as she has good income  and  financial  background.
    Bank statements and a letter from her employer have  been  provided  in
    support to confirm what she has said in her letter.  However,  although
    the appellant's wife may have said she has given the funds and/or  will
    make them available to the appellant, the fact remains that  the  money
    has not been transferred into the appellant's name. Nor have we had  an
    explanation as to the source of the funds. Having considered all of the
    information provided by the appellant's wife, we are not satisfied that
    the money presently in her name will, on the balance of  probabilities,
    be available to the appellant to invest in the proposed business.

28. For these reasons, and having looked at the application in  the  round,
    we do not accept that the requirements of the 1972 Rules have been met.

NOTICE OF DECISION

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains a material error of law
such that it must be set aside and remade.

We remake the decision and dismiss the appeal.

The appellant has not requested anonymity and we make no anonymity
direction.
