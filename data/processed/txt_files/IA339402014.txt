                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the Secretary of State's appeal against the decision  of  Judge
    Ince made following a hearing at Bradford on 3rd November 2014.

Background

 2. The claimant is a citizen of Nigeria born on 12th November  1970.   She
    came to the UK with a Tier 4 student visa on 17th February 2010 and was
    subsequently granted leave to remain on a Tier 1 Post-Study visa  until
    17th June 2014. The claimant and sponsor married in October 2014.

 3. On 11th June 2014 she applied for leave to remain  in  the  UK  on  the
    basis of her relationship.  She was refused because she did not satisfy
    the requirements of the partner route of Appendix FM since she had only
    been cohabiting with her partner since 10th May 2014 and  not  for  the
    period of two years as required by paragraph  GEN.1.2.   EX.1  did  not
    apply because the application fell to be refused  under  the  mandatory
    eligibility requirements of the Rules.  The Secretary  of  State  noted
    that the sponsor himself was only in the UK with discretionary leave to
    remain and not settled. Moreover,  the  claimed  parental  relationship
    with the sponsor's son did not fall within the definition  of  parental
    relationship under the Rules as the child's biological mother was still
    alive and in the UK.  She concluded  that  there  were  no  exceptional
    circumstances which would justify granting leave outside the Rules.

 4. The sponsor had married his first wife in June 2003 and  their  son  D,
    now aged 10, came to the UK more  than  7  years  ago.   Following  the
    divorce in November 2009 it was ordered that D reside with the sponsor.
     There is a prohibited steps order preventing D's removal from  the  UK
    without the permission of the court as  well  as  a  contact  order  in
    favour of his mother.

The Judge's Determination

 5. The judge recorded that he  was  satisfied  that  this  was  a  genuine
    relationship  and  marriage.   The  claimant  could  not  satisfy   the
    provisions of Appendix FM because the sponsor has only limited leave to
    remain, nor  does  she  meet  the  requirements  of  paragraph  276ADE.
    Furthermore, the Secretary  of  State  was  correct  to  say  that  the
    claimant does not fall within the definition of parent in the Rules.

 6. The judge took into account the requirements of Sections 117A and  117B
    of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  He said that,  to
    the extent that she had always had limited leave to remain, it could be
    argued that the claimant's immigration status was  precarious  although
    at all times she  did  have  leave,  albeit  not  permanent.   For  the
    purposes  of  Section  117B,  he  did  not  consider  that  a  parental
    relationship included that of stepparent but  it  was  clear  that  the
    claimant had a relationship akin to that of a  parent  with  D  and  in
    effect she was standing in the shoes of D's biological mother on a day-
    to-day  basis.   So  far  as  the  sponsor's  discretionary  leave  was
    concerned, he said that this did not prevent the claimant being allowed
    to remain in the UK as his spouse for the same length of time as he and
    his son had been granted.

 7. If she returned to Nigeria and made an application to return she  would
    be exempt from the English language certificate and all  the  necessary
    documents in relation to the financial requirements of  the  Rules  had
    been supplied.  It appeared to him probable that  she  would  meet  the
    relevant  requirements  if  she  returned  to  Nigeria  to   make   the
    application.  He rejected the argument  that  the  whole  family  could
    return to Nigeria together because of the prohibited  steps  order  and
    said that the only arguable proposal was that the claimant returned  to
    Nigeria by herself and make an application for a spouse visa there.  He
    considered that the separation of the claimant  from  D  would  have  a
    detrimental effect upon him.  In  any  event  it  was  clear  that  the
    Secretary of State had not taken into account Section  55  when  making
    her decision.  Accordingly the decision was not in accordance with  the
    law.

 8. He concluded:

         "Taken together I consider that these factors  cumulatively  amount
         to exceptional circumstances  that  justify  the  Appellant's  case
         being considered  under  the  residual  Article  8  provisions.   I
         consider that it would be unjustifiably harsh for her  to  have  to
         return to Nigeria just to make an  application  to  return  as  the
         spouse of the Sponsor.  It would be equally harsh  on  the  Sponsor
         and particularly D to be deprived of her presence here in the UK."

 9. In addressing the question of proportionality he said:

         "There is no factor really against the Appellant.   Whilst  it  was
         the case that at the time of the application and  of  the  decision
         she did not come within the Rules applicable to her case it is  now
         arguable as she is the Sponsor's spouse that she does  come  within
         the Rules."

The Grounds of Application

10. The Secretary of State sought permission to appeal.

11. First, she argued that the  judge  had  failed  to  adopt  the  correct
    approach in considering the sponsor's immigration status and had  erred
    in concluding that the only arguable proposal  was  that  the  claimant
    return to Nigeria. The Secretary of State  was  effectively  precluding
    from arguing that they should all return.  Appendix FM  clearly  allows
    arguments to be made in respect of return notwithstanding  a  grant  of
    discretionary  leave  to  a  family  member  which  is   reflected   in
    jurisprudence (Osawemwenze, R (On the Application  Of)  v  SSHD  [2014]
    EWHC 1564 Admin).

12. Second, the judge had failed  to  take  into  account  the  immigration
    status and nationalities  of  both  parties  to  the  appeal  and  that
    cohabitation started a short time before the application was made.   He
    had  failed  to  properly  consider  the  precarious  nature   of   the
    relationship which was established when  neither  had  any  expectation
    that they would be allowed to remain in the UK, and had failed to  take
    into account Section 117B(1).

13. Finally, in finding that the decision was not in  accordance  with  the
    law there was no need to go any further - SC (Article 8 - in accordance
    with the law) Zimbabwe [2012] UKUT 56.

14. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge Pirotta on 23rd February 2015
    for the reasons stated in the grounds.

Submissions

15. Mr Diwncyz relied on his grounds. He produced the very recent  decision
    of SSHD v SS (Congo) & Ors [2015] EWCA Civ 387 although he was not in a
    position to make representations on it.

16. Dr Mynott submitted that it was wrong to  say  that  the  Secretary  of
    State was precluded from requiring the sponsor to leave.  The judge had
    explained why he could not reasonably be expected to do so  because  of
    the prohibited steps order and had specifically addressed the  argument
    put forward by the Presenting Officer at the hearing.  Osawemwenze  was
    a decision on its own facts when both parties had no leave at the  time
    that the decision was mades and in any event was not a decision  giving
    in-depth guidance to the proper application of Article 8.

17. The judge had set out all of the  facts  carefully  and  discussed  the
    reasonableness of return.  There was no real challenge in  the  grounds
    to the nature of the relationship and it was open to the judge to place
    weight upon it, given that neither party was here unlawfully.   It  was
    crystal-clear that the claimant could not succeed under the  rules  and
    obvious that the  reference  to  meeting  their  requirements  referred
    solely to the marriage rules. The judge was entitled to state that  the
    refusal  letter  was  not  consistent  with  the  IDI  which  envisages
    circumstances such as these where the claimant is performing a  genuine
    parental role.

18. Finally the reference to SC Zimbabwe was a misreading of the case.

Findings and Conclusions

19. As Dr Mynott frankly acknowledged,  the  claimant  does  not  meet  the
    requirements of the rules.

20. She cannot succeed under the partner route both  because  she  has  not
    been living with the sponsor in a relationship akin to a  marriage  for
    the relevant period of time and, although the she has now married  him,
    she cannot meet the eligibility requirements because he  is  neither  a
    British citizen nor settled in the UK.  She did not make an application
    for limited leave to remain as a parent, which is no doubt  the  reason
    for a lack of reference to Section 55 in the refusal letter.

21. As the  judge  said,  the  case  could  only  ever  succeed  under  the
    exceptional circumstances provisions, as he put it, and/or Article 8.

22. So far as the grounds are concerned there is no merit in the contention
    that the Secretary of State was precluded from arguing that the  family
    should  return  as  a  unit.   The  judge  considered  that  submission
    specifically in paragraph 47 and rejected it because it  could  not  be
    assumed that the biological mother would give permission for the  child
    to go to Nigeria nor that the family court  would  necessarily  make  a
    decision in his favour.

23. Nor is it arguable that the judge failed to take into account the  fact
    that the sponsor's status was precarious. The claimant does not satisfy
    the requirements of Section 117B(1) of the 2002 Act as amended  because
    the sponsor is not a qualifying partner. However it is quite clear that
    the basis for the decision was not the relationship  with  the  sponsor
    but that the claimant's relationship with D  was  akin  to  that  of  a
    parent.

24. In the relevant IDI to Appendix FM 1.0 Family Life  (as  a  Partner  or
    Parent) at 11.2 it states that the  decision-maker  must  consider  the
    following factors where relevant.

25. At paragraph  11.2.1.  Is  there  a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
    relationship?:

         "Where the application is being considered under paragraph EX.1.(a)
         in respect of the ten year partner or parent routes, the  decision-
         maker  must  decide  whether  the  applicant  has  a  genuine   and
         subsisting parental relationship with  the  child.   This  will  be
         particularly relevant to cases where the child is the child of  the
         applicant's partner, or where the parent is  not  living  with  the
         child.

         The phrase goes beyond  the  strict  legal  definition  of  parent,
         reflected in the  definition  of  parent  in  paragraph  6  of  the
         Immigration Rules, to encompass situations in which  the  applicant
         is playing a genuinely parental role in  a  child's  life,  whether
         that is recognised as a matter of law or not.

         This means that an applicant living with a child of  their  partner
         and taking a stepparent role in  the  child's  life  could  have  a
         genuine and subsisting parental relationship  with  them,  even  if
         they had not formally adopted the child,  but  only  if  the  other
         biological parent played no part in the child's life, or there  was
         extremely  limited  contact  between  the  child  and   the   other
         biological parent.  But in a case where the other biological parent
         continued to maintain a close relationship with the child, even  if
         they were not  living  with  them,  a  new  partner  of  the  other
         biological parent could not normally have  a  role  equating  to  a
         genuine and subsisting parental relationship with the child."

26. The judge recorded that D last saw his mother in 2012 although she  was
    supposed to have fortnightly access to him when he spent weekends  with
    her.  They now just spoke to each other on  the  telephone  whenever  D
    liked, varying from weekly to every three to four months.

27. A situation in which a child has not seen his mother for two and a half
    years as at the date  of  the  hearing,  and  had  irregular  telephone
    contact with her could rationally amount to extremely  limited  contact
    within the meaning of the IDIs.  There is nothing perverse in the judge
    placing D's welfare at the heart of his conclusions, and  little  force
    in any of the specific challenges to this determination.

28. The real challenge behind these grounds is to the  rationality  of  the
    judge's decision and whether  he  was  entitled  to  allow  the  appeal
    outside the Immigration Rules at all.

29. In SSHD v SS the Court of Appeal considered the basic  legal  framework
    to both the leave to enter and leave to remain  Rules  as  set  out  in
    Appendix FM and the circumstances in which leave to remain outside  the
    Immigration  Rules  should  be  granted.   It  rejected   the   general
    proposition that leave outside the Rules  should  only  be  granted  in
    exceptional cases but stated:

         "However, in certain specific contexts,  a  proper  application  of
         Article 8 may itself make it clear that the legal test for granting
         LTR  or  LTE  outside  the  Rules  should  indeed  be  a  test   of
         exceptionality."

30. If family life could be carried on elsewhere

         "... it is unlikely that a direct and  immediate  link  will  exist
         between the measures requested by an applicant and his  family  ...
         such as to provide the basis for an  implied  obligation  upon  the
         state under Article 8(1) to grant leave to enter; see  also  G�l  v
         Switzerland, [42]."

31. The Court concluded that, so far as leave to enter was  concerned,  the
    appropriate general formulation would be that the applicant had to show
    that  "compelling  circumstances  exist  (which  are  not  sufficiently
    recognised under the new Rules) to require the grant  of  such  leave."
    The formulation, they said, was a fairly  demanding  test  but  not  as
    demanding as the exceptionality or very compelling  circumstances  test
    applicable  in  the  special  contexts  explained   in   MF   (Nigeria)
    (precariousness of family relationship and  deportation  of  foreigners
    convicted of serious crimes).

32. Although the judge did not have the benefit of the decision in SS,  his
    decision is not inconsistent with what the Court of Appeal said in that
    case. Given the  finding  that  family  life  could  not  be  conducted
    elsewhere because of the prohibited steps order, it is not  a  decision
    which it was not open to the judge to reach.

33. The last reference in the grounds to SC is misconceived.  In that  case
    the Upper Tribunal said:

         "We recognise that there are cases where a decision  to  refuse  an
         extension of stay or remove a  person  may  be  so  contrary  to  a
         requirement contained in an established policy or practice as to be
         not in accordance with the law.  In such a case the  analysis  does
         not move on  to  justification  for  Article  8  purposes  and  the
         decision must be remade in accordance with the law, either  by  the
         Secretary of State or the judge.  However, in our judgment this was
         not such a case."

34. That is exactly the situation here.
