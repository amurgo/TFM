Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms O'Brien, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondents:   Mr Anwar (Sponsor)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. For convenience we maintain the designations as they  were  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal, thus Mr and Mrs Anwar are the appellants  and  the
    ECO, the respondent.

 2. The appellants are citizens of Pakistan born in  1951  and  1957.   The
    respondent appeals against the decision of First  tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Fletcher-Hill made following a hearing at Hatton Cross on 6  June  2017
    to allow their appeals against the  refusal  to  grant  an  EEA  family
    permit for them to join their son, the  sponsor,  Mr  Waseem  Anwar,  a
    citizen of the Republic of Ireland, in the UK as dependent relatives.

 3. The applications were refused in a decision  made  on  5  January  2016
    under Regulations 7 and 8 of the Immigration (European  Economic  Area)
    Regulations 2006.  The respondent was not satisfied that the appellants
    are family members of the sponsor. Also, it  was  considered  that  any
    financial dependency on the sponsor is contrived. In that  regard  land
    from which income had been got had been gifted to the sponsor in 2015.

 4. They appealed.

    First tier hearing

 5. The judge heard oral evidence from the  sponsor  and  his  brother,  Mr
    Shahzad Anwar.  The gist of the evidence from the sponsor was that when
    he lived in Ireland exercising treaty rights he sent E1000-2000 a month
    to his parents.  Since moving to Scotland in 2015 he has  been  sending
    ï¿½150 a month.  His parents receive no  financial  support  from  anyone
    else.  They are retired.  His father used to  work  in  Kuwait  sending
    money back for the family.  However, he was not able to  save  for  his
    retirement or earn a pension in Kuwait.  They now  live  in  their  own
    house in Pakistan.  His mother had, as the respondent  noted,  owned  a
    plot of land which she had transferred to the sponsor.

 6. Brief evidence was also  given  by  Mr  Shahzad  Anwar,  the  sponsor's
    brother.  He lives in  Finland  where  he  is  studying.   He  has  not
    supported his parents financially.

 7. The judge's findings are  at  paragraph  [20f].   She  found  that  the
    relationship of parents and child is as  claimed.   On  dependency  she
    found that the documentary evidence showed  that  the  appellants  have
    continued to be supported financially  by  the  sponsor  who  has  been
    exercising treaty rights as a worker in the UK since at least 2015, and
    that they need his material support to meet their essential needs.  She
    found, further, that whether the dependency is a matter of necessity or
    choice is irrelevant.  In that regard she  noted  Lim  (EEA-dependency)
    [2013] UKUT 437 and Lebon (C/316/85) [1987] ECR 2811,  concluding  that
    what matters is the fact of dependency not the reason for  it.   Whilst
    dependency must not be an abuse of rights it can be a matter of choice.
     Emotional dependency between the parents and their  son  can  also  be
    considered.

    Upper Tribunal hearing

 8. The respondent sought permission to appeal  which  was  granted  on  18
    December 2017.  The grounds were, briefly, first,  the  judge  had  not
    made a reasoned finding on the relationship and, second, she was  wrong
    to state that whether dependency is a matter of necessity or choice  is
    irrelevant.  In  that  regard  Lim  in  the  Upper  Tribunal  had  been
    overturned by the Court of Appeal in Lim  v  Entry  Clearance  Officer,
    Manila [2015] EWCA Civ 1383.

 9. At the hearing before us Ms O'Brien sought only to rely on  the  second
    ground to which she had nothing to add.

10. The sponsor, Mr Waseem Anwar had attended with his brother  Mr  Shahzad
    Anwar.  We invited Mr Anwar to reply.  We refer to his comments below.

    Consideration

11. The relevant regulation in issue is 7(1)(c).  It provides that:-

           "... for the purposes of these Regulations the following persons
           shall be treated as the family members of another person ...


           (c)  dependent direct relatives in his ascending line or that of
           his spouse or civil partner."

      The test for dependency has, indeed, most recently been considered  by
    the Court of Appeal in Lim.

12. We note the following comments by Elias LJ: "... Receipt of support  is
    a necessary but not sufficient condition.  It  is  still  necessary  to
    determine that a family member is dependent in the sense  of  being  in
    need  of  the  assistance.   I  accept  that  the  authorities  clearly
    establish that it is irrelevant why he or  she  is  dependent,  whether
    because he has given his money away or because he is unwilling to  work
    (save possibly where an abuse of rights can be established) ..." [29]

13. And at [32]: "In my judgment, the  critical  question  is  whether  the
    claimant is in fact in a position to support himself or not, and  Reyes
    [2014/C-423/12] now makes that clear beyond doubt, in my view.  That is
    a simple matter of fact.  If  he  can  support  himself,  there  is  no
    dependency, even if he is given financial material support  by  the  EU
    citizen.  Those additional resources are not necessary to enable him to
    meet his basic needs.  If, on the other hand, he cannot support himself
    from his own resources, the court will not ask why that  is  the  case,
    save perhaps where there is an abuse of rights ...".

14. Mr Anwar's submissions were that, as he had stated in  evidence  before
    the First-tier Tribunal, he has remitted money to his parents for years
    and that that money has been necessary  to  ensure  their  core  living
    needs.  They live in their home and have no rental costs but they  have
    no source of income.

15. As for the respondent's concern in the refusal letter about the gift of
    land to the sponsor by his parents, Mr Anwar said that his  mother  had
    bought a small plot of land about the size of half  a  football  pitch.
    It was agreed it should be put in the sponsor's name.  There is nothing
    growing on it and it is not valuable.

16. Ms O'Brien did not wish to make any reply.

17. We found Mr Anwar's submissions persuasive.  The  evidence  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal was that the  appellants  receive  money  from  the
    sponsor and that having no income of their own they need that financial
    assistance to get by.  Ms O'Brien did not  seek  to  dispute  that  the
    transfer which concerned the ECO was a small piece of unutilised  land.
    As Elias LJ stated it is irrelevant why that transfer was made.  It was
    not suggested before the First-tier Tribunal  or  before  us  that  the
    appellants  had  artificially  attempted  to  create  a  situation   of
    dependency so as to establish an entitlement to enter the UK, so  there
    is no question of abuse of rights in this case.

18. The judge did err in law by taking as authority the case of Lim in  the
    Upper Tribunal being unaware that the matter had been overturned by the
    Court of Appeal.

19. However, we conclude that her error was  not  material.   The  findings
    that the appellants receive money from their son and that  they  depend
    on that money to support themselves were findings open to  her  on  the
    evidence.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal does not involve  the  making  of  a
material error of law.  That decision allowing the appeals shall stand.

No anonymity orders made.
