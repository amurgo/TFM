                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                           ENTRY CLEARANCE OFFICER
                                                                  Respondent

                   Determination and reasons - withdrawal

   1.    The appellant sought leave  to  withdraw  her  appeal  against  the
      decision of the First-tier Tribunal dismissing her appeal against  the
      refusal to grant her entry clearance  as  the  dependant  of  her  son
      permission to appeal having been granted on 21st August 2014.


   2. There was no objection from the respondent and I consent to withdrawal
      of the appellant's case pursuant to Rule 17(2).

   3.   The consequence of this is that, there being no challenge  remaining
      to the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal,  the  appeal  before  the
      Upper Tribunal is dismissed so that the determination and decision  of
      First-tier Tribunal Judge Saunders remains undisturbed.
                                                 Date 22nd October 2014
                                                                 Upper
