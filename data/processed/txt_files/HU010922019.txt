For the Appellant:     Mr M Iqbal of Muzaffar Associates Ltd
For the Respondent:    Mr A Govan, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of India, where he was born in 1990.  He has
    been granted permission to appeal the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Kempton, who for reasons given in her decision dated 21  February
    2019, dismissed the appellant's appeal against the Secretary of State's
    decision refusing his human rights claim for leave  to  remain  in  the
    United Kingdom on the basis of his family life with  his  partner  [CM]
    and her daughter.

 2. As to his immigration history, the appellant entered the United Kingdom
    on 15 May 2012 on a six month family visit visa.   He  overstayed.   In
    February 2014 he claims to have met Ms [M]  in  a  nightclub.   He  was
    detained at Dungavel Immigration  Centre  after  being  encountered  by
    police in Scotland in February 2015.  A human  rights  claim  based  on
    Article  8  was  refused  and  certified  under  Section  94   of   the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002  with  an  out-of-country
    right of  appeal.   This  led  to  judicial  review  proceedings.   The
    appellant attended a marriage interview in November 2016  but  did  not
    comply with a request to bring valid identification documentation.   In
    June 2017 the couple  were  married.   In  July  2018  judicial  review
    proceedings  were  settled  on  the  basis  that  there  would   be   a
    reconsideration of  the  decision.   The  appellant  submitted  further
    evidence in September 2018.    On  10  October  2018  the  Home  Office
    requested further evidence in relation to claims regarding  his  family
    life with Ms [M]'s daughter and no response had been  received  by  the
    time of the refusal for which reasons were given in a decision  by  the
    respondent dated 2 January 2019.

 3. The challenge before Judge Kempton was that the respondent had erred in
    finding the appellant was not in a genuine relationship with  his  wife
    and that it was subsisting.  The  judge  found  that  the  couple  were
    living together in the same house and have been doing so since 27 March
    2015.   She found their marriage to be  genuine  and  subsisting.   She
    also accepted that the judge was involved "... to a considerable extent
    in the care and wellbeing of his wife's daughter ...".

 4. The judge considered the  case  under  the  Immigration  Rules  and  in
    particular EX.1.  Having previously concluded the appellant  could  not
    be regarded as a parent or a person with a parental  relationship  with
    Ms [M]'s daughter, she concluded at [28]:

         "28. It would appear that the position of the respondent is correct
             and that the appellant is not within  the  definition  of  the
             Rules, and so does not have a parental relationship with  [K],
             as he is not her guardian, adoptive father or a person who has
             sought parental rights in the civil court in relation to  [K].
             Accordingly, his relationship with her, for  the  purposes  of
             the Immigration Rules cannot be considered."

 5.  The  judge  then  went  on  to  consider  the  issue  of   exceptional
    circumstances in terms of GEN.3.2. and set out her conclusions at  [30]
    to [34]:

         "30. The facts are that the appellant has overstayed for  a  number
             of years since the summer of 2012.  He  then  simply  did  not
             return home.  He had been working  for  about  four  years  in
             India before he came to the UK.  He knows  some  English  from
             having been at school to senior school level.  He has not been
             convicted of any criminal offences in the UK.  However, he has
             been detained twice on immigration bail and has been found  to
             have been working without permission.  He has also carried out
             charitable work in the UK.  He entered into his  relationship,
             and married, knowing that he had no right to be in the UK,  as
             did his wife.  She has been fully supportive of him.  His wife
             would not go to live in India as all her family,  her  friends
             and her life are here.  She has a large and close family.  She
             works extra hours to support her husband.  However, she  could
             not earn enough to sponsor him to come to the  UK  to  be  her
             husband by way of a  spouse  application  if  he  returned  to
             India.  Her daughter has family, schooling and life in the UK.
              She was born in the UK and lived here all her life.   She  is
             aged eleven years.  [K]  has  a  good  relationship  with  the
             appellant.

         31.  If the appellant were to return to  India.   He  would  be  so
             alone.  He could find work there as he  previously  worked  in
             India for four years after school before coming to the UK.  He
             has work experience, albeit without permission in the UK.   He
             has learned to speak and read English quite  well  in  the  UK
             (although he did use the Punjabi interpreter, as is his right,
             at the hearing before me).   The  appellant's  wife  does  not
             consider that she would ever be in a position to earn  ï¿½22,400
             as required to sponsor her husband from India to come and live
             with her and her daughter in the UK.  However, it is not clear
             what steps  she  has  taken  to  find  out  what  higher  paid
             employment she could take on.  In any event, her  daughter  is
             getting older and will soon be in senior school,  leaving  Mrs
             [M] in a position to work a  full-time  position  through  the
             week.  [K] is old enough to go to school herself, or  by  bus,
             and to return home.  She also has an older sister who can help
             out, when she is not working, as well as her oldest sister and
             her grandmother who seems now to be well and with  no  obvious
             difficulty in looking after an eleven-year old child when  she
             Is not at school.

         32.   It  seems  to  me  that  there  are  no  obvious  exceptional
             circumstances here.  The only issue is that the appellant  and
             his wife have a genuine and subsisting relationship  and  want
             to be together.  In such circumstances, hard decisions have to
             be made.  Either the appellant returns to India and takes  his
             wife and her daughter with him or he returns alone  and  seeks
             to maintain contact by way of visits each way.  His  wife  can
             try to find better paid employment to sponsor him.

         33.  In the meantime, the appellant and  his  wife  might  want  to
             consider taking advice in relation  to  acquiring  a  parental
             relationship over [K] if he wishes to revisit this  matter  by
             way of the Immigration Rules.

         34.  In relation to Article 8 of ECHR, I have  taken  into  account
             the issue of section 55 and the best interests of  the  child.
             The child is best to be with her parents.  In this  case,  the
             one whom she lives with, her mother.  The  appellant  has  not
             applied for parental rights in  relation  to  [K]  and  so  he
             cannot be prepared as a parent for the purpose of this appeal.
               The  interference  in  family  life  of  the  appellant   is
             proportionate to the need for proper immigration control."

 6. The grounds of challenge argue:

    (i)  The judge had erred in not considering the appellant as  a  parent
         in accordance with the definition in the Rules with reference to R-
         LTRP.1.1(a), (b) and (d).

    (ii) The judge had failed to consider the case with reference to  EX.2.
         of Appendix FM regarding insurmountable obstacles, being  the  very
         significant difficulties to be  faced  by  the  appellant  and  his
         partner continuing their family life outside the UK.

    (iii)     The  judge  had  failed  to  give  "due  diligence"  to   the
         appellant's case.  There had been a failure to consider the case in
         accordance with Chikwamba v SSHD [2008] UKHL 40.

 7. In granting  permission  to  appeal,  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Loke
    observed:

         "2.  While the Judge correctly found that the appellant  could  not
             fall within the Immigration Rules, it  is  arguable  that  the
             Judge failed to consider whether the appellant had a  parental
             and subsisting relationship with his step-daughter outside  of
             the rules, and the interests of the appellant's  step-daughter
             in the context of s117B(6)."

 1. At the outset of the hearing Mr Govan explained that he agreed that the
    FtT had erred on the basis of the grounds of challenge  with  reference
    to the judge's approach to the case under Appendix FM.   In  particular
    the judge had misdirected himself as the  what  is  meant  by  parental
    responsibility.  In my view Mr Govan was correct to take this approach;
    the judge had unlawfully restricted the class of  those  who  could  be
    considered to have parental responsibility.

 2. This led to the decision being set aside.  As to its remaking, Mr Govan
    accepted that there were "probably"  insurmountable  obstacles  to  the
    appellant's partner joining him in India and conceded the  appeal.   He
    referred to the decisions of the Court of Appeal in SSHD v AB (Jamaica)
    [2019] EWCA Civ 661 and  of  the  Upper  Tribunal  in  JG  (s  117B(6):
    reasonable to leave" UK) Turkey [2019] UKUT 72  (IAC)  Rev  1.   In  my
    judgment it was correct for Mr Govan to not only accept that the  judge
    had erred but also that, based on the factual  findings  that  had  not
    been challenged, the appeal should be conceded.  Legislation had  fixed
    the  public  interest  irrespective  of  the  appellant's   immigration
    history.

DECISION

 3. The determination of the FtT is set aside.  I re-make the decision  and
    allow the appeal against the Secretary of State's decision.
