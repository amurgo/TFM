                                                                 Respondents


For the Appellant:     Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

For the Respondent:    Mr T D Ruddy, of Jain, Neil & Ruddy, Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. Parties are as above, but the rest of this determination refers to them
    as they were in the FtT.

 2. The appellants are father and daughter, accepted  by  the  SSHD  to  be
    Sikhs from Afghanistan.

 3. This decision is to be read with:

      i)  The  SSHD's  decisions  dated  15  December  2017,  refusing   the
         appellants' claim.

     ii) The appellants' grounds of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal.

    iii) The decision of Designated FtT  Judge  Murray,  promulgated  on  26
         March 2018.

     iv) The SSHD's grounds of appeal to the UT, stated in  the  application
         for permission to appeal dated 10 April 2018.

      v) The grant of permission dated 16 April 2018.

     vi) The rule  24  response,  dated  13  June  2018,  to  the  grant  of
         permission.

 4.  Ground  1  contends  that  the  judge  noted  difficulties  with   the
    appellants' evidence at [58], [60] and [71],  but  allowed  the  appeal
    only because  the  appellants  are  Sikhs  from  Afghanistan,  and  the
    standard of proof is low, without making any  finding  on  credibility.
    Ground 2 is on the same theme, alleging absence of a  finding  about  a
    threatening letter from the Taliban.  Ground 3  says  that  absence  of
    fact-finding is a material error, and that per country guidance,  being
    an Afghan Sikh is not enough.

 5. Mr Matthews acknowledged that at [58] the judge said that discrepancies
    were "not major", and at [71], summing up, that she had "minor doubts",
    but he said that left matters unresolved, and the case required  to  be
    reheard in the FtT.

 6. Mr Ruddy submitted on these lines:

      i) The respondent's decision addressed to the second appellant at [23]
         identifies "one major discrepancy" between the accounts of the  two
         appellants, namely that her father made no mention at any point  of
         a threat to kidnap his daughter.

     ii) That was also a major point in the respondent's decision  addressed
         to the first appellant at [34].

    iii) The  paragraphs  referenced  in  ground  1  went  to  that  alleged
         discrepancy.

     iv) As the judge went on to find nothing in it, very  little  more  was
         required to explain the outcome.  At [60] the judge  accepted  that
         the first appellant had mentioned the threat at interview.  At  Q/A
         31 he said, "... they gave us one month to ... accept Islam or they
         will kill us and take my daughter by  force  and  convert  her  and
         marry her."

      v) The one major point raised by the SSHD was resolved  in  favour  of
         the appellants.

     vi) Ground 2 referred to a minor issue raised at  the  hearing  by  the
         SSHD about the appearance of the  threatening  letters,  which  the
         judge rejected at [61.

    vii) At [63] the judge declined to give  "much  weight"  to  failure  to
         claim in third countries.  Again, no error was alleged.

   viii) The judge found  only  minor  reasons  for  which  the  appellants'
         evidence might be doubted, and resolved the  main  issue  in  their
         favour.  There was no absence of findings  on  the  core  of  their
         case.

 7. I find that the line of submission by Mr Ruddy  is  well  founded,  and
    that the grounds and submission for the SSHD do not disclose absence of
    findings by the judge.  Reading her decision fairly and as a whole, she
    found them credible, having  given  sound  reasons  for  rejecting  the
    SSHD's main criticisms of their credibility made in the refusal letters
    and in submissions at the hearing.

 8. On reference to Q/A 31, it appears that the  SSHD's  major  credibility
    point was wrong in the first place.

 9. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.

10. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
