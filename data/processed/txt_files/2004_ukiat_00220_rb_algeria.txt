                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. The appellant is a citizen of Algeria who has been given permission to
      appeal the Determination of an Adjudicator, Mr M Ghani, dismissing  on
      both Refugee Convention and Human Rights Grounds  his  appeal  against
      the respondent's decision to give directions for his removal from  the
      United Kingdom following the refusal of asylum.

   2. Mr B Naumann, a Solicitor from Duncan Lewis & Co, Solicitors  appeared
      for  the  appellant.   The  appellant  attended  the   hearing.    The
      respondent was represented by Mr A Hutton, a  Home  Office  Presenting
      Officer.

   3. The appellant arrived  in  the  United  Kingdom  clandestinely  on  27
      September 2002.  He claimed asylum that day.   The  notice  containing
      the decision against which he  appeals  is  dated  6  May  2003.   The
      Adjudicator heard the appeal on 18 September 2003  and  permission  to
      appeal was granted on 20 January 2004.

   4. The appellant claimed to fear persecution from the GIA both  generally
      and because his brothers were involved with the Algerian military.  He
      also claimed to fear persecution from  the  authorities  and  the  non
      Berber population because of his Berber ethnicity.

   5. The Adjudicator found that the appellant was not a  credible  witness.
      He concluded that the appellant had not  established  either  a  well-
      founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason or that his  human
      rights were likely to be infringed.

   6. We have a 167 page bundle from the  appellant's  representatives  and,
      from the respondent, the April 2004 Algeria Country Report.

   7. Paragraph 1 of the grounds of appeal submits that in paragraph  12  of
      the determination the Adjudicator misdirected himself as  to  the  law
      relating to Article 3.  In this paragraph the Adjudicator said,

           "The standard of proof in human  rights  appeals  falls  on  the
           appellant to demonstrate that there  has  been  an  interference
           with his human rights under a  relevant  article.   If  he  does
           establish such interference then the respondent  must  establish
           that the interference is justified."


      We accept that this passage is incomplete and misleading.   There  can
      be  no  interference  with  Article  3  rights,  which  are  absolute.
      However, Mr Naumann accepted that this was not the  strongest  of  the
      grounds of appeal and he did not attempt to argue that it had  made  a
      material difference to the Adjudicator's reasoning or conclusions.  We
      find that this is an unfortunate error but that there is no indication
      that there has been any adverse consequence for the appellant.  It  is
      not material".

   8. Paragraph 2 of the grounds of appeal submit that, in Paragraph  42  of
      the determination, the Adjudicator  should  not  have  relied  on  the
      conclusion that the appellant's  evidence  was  "on  occasions  vague"
      without particularising what was  vague.   The  sentence  in  question
      reads, "I did not find the appellant impressive and  on  occasions  he
      was vague in his replies."  This passage appears at the  beginning  of
      the Adjudicator's findings of credibility and fact after the words  "I
      had the benefit of listening to the appellant give oral evidence."   .
      We find that the Adjudicator was commenting on his overall  impression
      of the appellant's evidence and that he was entitled to do so.   These
      reasons would not suffice on their own but they do not have  to.   The
      Adjudicator went on to give further and more detailed reasons for  his
      adverse credibility finding.   We  will  return  to  the  question  of
      whether these support the conclusion.

   9. Paragraph 3 of the grounds of appeal  does  no  more  than  supplement
      paragraph 2.

  10. Paragraph 4 of the grounds of appeal submits that in paragraph  42  of
      the determination, the Adjudicator failed to consider that there could
      have been an innocent error in interpretation.  This  relates  to  the
      Adjudicator's  conclusion  that  he  found  it  incredible  that   the
      appellant, when his statements were read over to him, did not  correct
      the statement which he subsequently denied, that he was  a  policeman.
      In cross-examination  the  appellant  merely  said  that  this  was  a
      mistake.   He  did  not  attribute  the  mistake  to   an   error   of
      interpretation.   There  was  no  obligation  on  the  Adjudicator  to
      consider another explanation, which the appellant had not suggested.

  11. Paragraph 5 of the grounds of appeal submits, in relation to paragraph
      43 of the determination,  that  the  Adjudicator  failed  to  consider
      whether the authorities would provide the appellant with a sufficiency
      of protection.  This is to misunderstand  the  Adjudicator's  purpose.
      The Adjudicator is taking a point going to credibility, open to him on
      the evidence, that in the light of  the  country  information  it  was
      likely that  the  police  would  react  if  he  complained  about  the
      activities  of  the  GIA.   We  will  deal  with   the   question   of
      discrimination by the authorities against the appellant because of his
      Berber ethnicity in relation to the next ground of appeal.

  12. Paragraph 6 of the grounds of appeal submit that, in paragraph  47  of
      the determination, the Adjudicator erred in stating that the objective
      evidence was clear, that there was no persecution of ethnic Berbers in
      Algeria, and that in reaching this conclusion the  Adjudicator  failed
      to pay proper regard to the country information.  Paragraph 7  of  the
      grounds of appeal is the related issue of whether, in connection  with
      the appellant's  Berber  ethnicity,  the  Adjudicator  considered  the
      Tribunal determination in Toufik Taib [2002]  UKIAT 08034.

  13. We find that the Adjudicator's reasons  for  the  adverse  credibility
      finding are not flawed.  He was entitled to come to  this  conclusion.
      We also find that it is a blanket adverse  credibility  finding  which
      encompasses the appellant's evidence  as  to  why  he  was  persecuted
      because of his Berber ethnicity.  This part of the  appellant's  claim
      has not been set out in any detail.  Mr Naumann directed our attention
      to paragraphs 11 and 12 of the appellant's witness statement at  6  of
      his bundle which states,

           "11.  As well  as  these  incidents  the  Gendarmerie,  who  are
                 Algerian Darak, has beaten  me  two  times  because  of  my
                 ethnicity as a Barbar (Sic).  There are  conflicts  between
                 Darak and Barbar, due to this the Gendarmes have beaten me.



            12.   I have been  persecuted  because  of  my  ethnicity  as  a
                 Barbar.  I am not Arabic.  The  Arab  population  hates  my
                 people.  There is severe discrimination on a  daily  basis.
                 Regarding my ethnicity as a Barbar, Arab people  have  said
                 that I am a traitor and I was being verbally  abused  daily
                 in Alonnab.  I would receive the same treatment anywhere in
                 Algeria."


14.   Page 164 of the appellant's bundle, from the World Socialist  Website,
      states that about a third of the Algerian population are Berbers.

15.   Mr Naumann took us to the Tribunal determination in  Toufik  Taib  and
      in particular the following passages in paragraphs 24 and 25  at  page
      27 of the appellant's bundle,

           "Further, on the evidence accepted the charge was overtly linked
           to the comment that the appellant wanted a separate state and it
           is difficult to escape the conclusion that the matter would  not
           have been handled the way it was save that the appellant  was  a
           Berber... These events must be placed in the general context  of
           demonstrations connected with the  rights  of  Berbers  and  the
           violent methods employed by the state in dealing with them."

16.   We find that the conclusions of the Tribunal in  Toufik  Taib  do  not
      relate to Berbers in general.  The appellant in that case was a Berber
      and a school teacher who, with others, went on  strike  in  solidarity
      with a Berber student who was killed in detention. This individual was
      a politically active Berber who was arrested, detained and ill-treated
      because  of  his  Berber  politically  related  activities.   He   was
      suspected of being a  member  of  a  separatist  movement.   The  case
      depended on its particular facts and the Presenting  Officer  conceded
      that the appellant had made out his case.  It does not  assist  us  in
      this case or in relation to Berbers generally.   Mr  Naumann  accepted
      that the country information did not show that  all  Berbers  were  at
      risk in Algeria.

17.   There is a great  deal  of  information  in  the  April  2004  Algeria
      Country  Report  about  Berbers.   The  main  passages   are   between
      Paragraphs 6.146 and 6.170 in the following terms:-


      Ethnic Groups
      The Berbers

      6.146 The Berbers  are  the  major  ethnic  minority  in  Algeria  and
           comprise a little over one quarter of the population - 7 million
           people.  The Berbers are concentrated mainly in the  mountainous
           areas of Kabylia, Chaouia, the Mzab and the  Sahara.   They  are
           the indigenous inhabitant of the North  African  littoral.   The
           majority of Algerians are  of  Berber  descent,  although  as  a
           result of centuries of integration the two main ethnic groups of
           Arab and Berber have become increasingly indistinguishable.


      6.147 Berber Language and Culture  The Berbers wish to keep their  own
           culture, and their languages, the principal  one  being  usually
           referred to as  Tamazight.   The  majority  of  Berber  speaking
           people are found in the Kabylia  area.   Other  Berber  dialects
           exist  in  rural  areas.   The  languages  are  primarily  oral,
           although there are written forms.  The National charter of  1996
           recognised the  Berber  culture  and  language  as  one  of  the
           components of Algerian identity.  In April 2002 the constitution
           was amended to  recognise  Tamazight  as  a  national  language.
           However, the  1996  legislation  on  Arabisation  requires  that
           Arabic be the official language for public  business,  including
           official documents.


      6.148 Tamazight is taught at  a  number  of  primary  schools  in  the
           Kabylia area.  In July 2003 the Government announced a  decision
           to enhance the teaching of Tamazight in the  national  education
           system.  There is a university chair for Tamazight.  It was also
           announced in August 2003 that a national centre would be set  up
           to promote the Berber language.  There is a 'Haut commissariat �
           l'Amazighit�' under the ministry of  Communication  and  culture
           which organised, among other things, a Berber film  festival  in
           September 2002.


      6.149 Newspapers and periodicals appear in the Berber language and the
           government-owned national television station broadcasts a  brief
           nightly news programme in Tamazight.  In the Kabylia area,  many
           television shows  and  documentaries  are  shown  in  Tamazight.
           There is a Berber television channel based in France.


      6.150 Berber Groups  The Mouvement Cultural Berb�re  (Berber  Cultural
           Movement) (MCB) was founded  in  1976  and  is  not  so  much  a
           political party as a pressure group for Berber issues.    It  is
           engaged in efforts to promote the Berber language and  identity.
           Each April the MCB organises demonstrations in Kabylie towns  to
           commemorate the "Berber Spring" when a number of  students  were
           killed in demonstrations in Tizi Ouzou in 1980.


      6.151 The two main Berber parties, the  FFS  and  the  RCD  are  legal
           parties.  The Kabylia-based RCD and  FFS  parties  have  largely
           Berber membership.  There is rivalry between  the  two  parties.
           RCD members were part of the government until they  withdrew  in
           May 2001 in protest at the government's handling of protests  in
           Kabylia (see below).  Mouvement pour l'Autonomie  Kabylie  (MAK)
           led by Ferhat  Mehenni  is  a  minor  party  that  advocates  an
           autonomous Kabylia.  A report by the International Crisis  group
           in June 2003 stated that the  MAK,  although  supported  outside
           Algeria, was not popular in Kabylia, and that it had  been  used
           by the authorities to divert attention from the demands  of  the
           protest movement.


      6.152 Treatment of Berbers Berbers hold high office in the government,
           army, police,  business,  and  journalism.   The  current  prime
           Minster,  Ahmed  Ouyahia,  is  a  Kabyle.   The  MCB  was  quite
           unequivocal in stating in 2001 that Berbers were not  persecuted
           in Algeria and that anyone claiming so is  doing  it  merely  to
           advance  his  own  interest.   UNHCR  have   recognised   Berber
           aspirations for recognition of their identity  and  culture  but
           stated in 1997 that Algeria's population is ethnically mixed and
           ethnic minorities seem to fear no more and no  less  than  other
           Algerians.  The ICG reported in June 203 that "The  Kabyles  are
           not generally discriminated against in public life on the  basis
           of their identity, and their preoccupation with  the  issue  [of
           identity] has other causes."


      6.153 Events of 2001 - 2004 in Kabylia from April 2001  there  were  a
           series of protest demonstrations and  strikes  in  this  largely
           Berber  area.   Up  to  eighty  people  were  killed  in   riots
           immediately following the  death  of  a  young  man,  Massinissa
           Guermah, in policy custody.  The security forces reportedly used
           excessive force throughout the region  against  the  protestors.
           Demonstrations and riots quickly spread in reaction  in  Kabylia
           and other parts of the country, with further  deaths.   Protests
           occurred in forty out of the forty-eight provinces of Algeria in
           the following months.


      6.154 The demonstrations were seen  by  observers  as  having  stemmed
           initially from the security forces mishandling of the  immediate
           situation in Kabylia  in  April  2001.   However,  they  ignited
           further protests  over  the  traditional  Berber  agitation  for
           language  and  cultural  recognition,  and   encompassed   wider
           expressions of anger and despair over poverty, unemployment  and
           lack of housing,  hostility  towards  abuses  of  power  by  the
           gendarmerie, and the perceived failure of  the  regime  to  deal
           with these issues.


      6.155 A report by the International Crisis Group (ICG)  in  June  2003
           analysed the situation in Kabylia.  The report  noted  that  the
           protests that  started  in  2001  were  about  local  government
           failings  and  socio-economic  grievances  and  that  they  have
           continued so long in  Kabylia  as  opposed  to  other  parts  of
           Algeria because of the specific conditions  there.   The  report
           stated the principal complaint of the rioters of 2001 in Kabylia
           and elsewhere in Algeria was the contempt they  receive  at  the
           hands of authority (hogra) who abuse their power with  impunity.
           The report also noted that since the advent of pluralism in 1989
           substantial practical concessions have been made to  acknowledge
           the separate Berber identity of Algeria.  However, although  the
           Algerian Government has made concessions it has not handled  the
           issues well.


      6.156 El Kseur In June 2001 the Berber  leaders  produced  a  list  of
           fifteen demands concerning their grievances, known  as  the  "El
           Kseur platform".  These included  official  recognition  of  the
           Berber language, and judicial trials for paramilitary  policemen
           involved in killing unarmed civilians  in  April  and  May,  and
           compensation of the victims for the behaviour of the authorities
           during the protest marches.


      6.157  Issad  Report  In  July  2001  the  provisional  report  by  an
           independent commission chaired by a well  known  Kabyle  lawyer,
           Professor Mohand Issad, held the gendarmerie mainly  responsible
           for the violence of April 2001 and  the  following  months.   It
           stated  the  violence  was  provoked  and  kept  going  by   the
           gendarmes, also that their behaviour must have resulted from the
           Commanders loss of control of his troops, or was the product  of
           interference with the chain of command.


      6.158 Speaking shortly before the report was issued, the head  of  the
           security forces acknowledged the need for  improvements  in  the
           police force and said these would be addressed.  Also, according
           to The Middle East and North Africa 2004 50th Edition,  "Earlier
           the heads of the gendarmerie and civil police, as  well  as  the
           ministry of the Interior, had admitted the existence of abuse in
           the Kabylie but denied that it was systematic and widespread."


      6.159 Organisation of the protests Much of the local organisation  was
           provided initially through the traditional  village  committees,
           (aarch or aarouche), which rejected local official,  politicians
           and police.  They were formed into regional groups  -  the  main
           ones reportedly were the Coordination  des  Aarouch,  Dairas  et
           Communes (CADC) which coordinated local committees in  the  Tizi
           Ouzou area; the Coordination Intercommunale de B�jaia (CICB)  in
           and around the city of B�jaia; and the Coordination des  Comites
           Citoyens de la Wilaya de Bouira (CCCWB).


      6.160 ICG reported  that  these  three  bodies,  together  with  their
           counterparts  from  the  peripheral  wilayats   established   an
           umbrella body called the Coordination Interwilayas  des  'aarch,
           dairas et communes (CIADC) and that it was this latter body drew
           up the movement's platform at El Kseur.  The ICG  report  stated
           that  the  Coordinations  were  political  mobilisations   whose
           structures were based on a traditional tribal system.   However,
           it was misleading to call the protest  movement  the  aarch  and
           regard them as traditional.


      6.161 Several  opposition  parties  also  took  part  in  the  various
           protests and demonstrations, including the FFS, RCD, MDC and PT,
           and also women's groups.  The  RCD,  the  mainly  pro-government
           Berber political party, withdrew from the Government in  protest
           in May 2001 at its handling of the riots.   The  ICG  report  in
           2003 stated that the FFS and RCD were taken by surprise in  2001
           and were unable to represent the popular  protests.   They  have
           since sought to regain this lost ground.


      6.162 In March 2002 the President  announced  a  number  of  measures,
           addressing some of the El Kseur  demands.   These  included  the
           adoption of the Berber language as a national (but not official)
           language, and compensation for victims  of  the  violence.   The
           President did not agree to one of the El  Kseur  demands  -  the
           withdrawal of gendarme units from the area -  saying  that  this
           was impractical.


      6.163 The President also stated that twenty-four gendarme  agents  and
           give police officers had been charged with homicide or  improper
           use of their firearms and  that  their  trails  would  be  open.
           According to HRW, "However, in the months following this  strong
           statement, it was possible to verify only  two  or  three  cases
           where security force agents had been  bought  to  trail.   These
           included the October  29  conviction  by  a  military  court  of
           gendarme Merabet Mestari.  Merabet was sentenced to two years in
           prison for  involuntary  homicide  in  the  killing  of  student
           Massinissa  Guermah,  the  incident  that  triggered  months  of
           protests in the Kabylie in 2001".


      6.164 Voting in the May 2002 legislative  elections  and  the  October
           2002 local elections was widely boycotted in Kabylia.  Both  the
           RCD and FFS parties refused to participate in the May  election.
           However the FFS took part in the October election.


      6.165 Protests were made in response to the arrest  and  detention  in
           October 2002 of coordination leaders who had organised protests.
            In December six of the group, including Belaid Abrika,  a  CADC
           leaders, and five of his associates began a hunger strike.   The
           ended  in  mid-January  2003  when  it  became  clear  that  the
           authorities would  not  release  them.   An  indefinite  general
           strike due to take place in January 2003 was abandoned owing  to
           lack of support and it was reported that the people  of  Kabylia
           were weary of the conflict.


      6.166 2003 In April 2003 thousands of Berbers  took  part  in  a  mass
           demonstration to mark the anniversary of the Berber  Spring  and
           the protests of April 2001, and to support the prisoners.  A one
           day general strike also took place in April 2003.


      6.167 In June 2003, after the release of  the  leaders  who  had  been
           imprisoned since the previous year for taking part in  protests,
           the Coordinations reportedly decided to agree to negotiate  with
           the  government  about  the  El  Kseur  demands.   The  previous
           position taken by  the  coordinations  that  all  the  El  Kseur
           demands were not negotiable had  reportedly  led  to  entrenched
           positions between the groups and the government, and  the  aarch
           movement had developed  internal  dissension  and  lost  popular
           support.  The ICG reported that the power of  the  Coordinations
           had declined since 2001 and its intransigent line had led it  to
           clash with important elements of public opinion  in  the  region
           the expense of the massive support it had originally mobilised.


      6.168 In August 2003 it was  reported  that  the  government  had  the
           citizens  movement  had  agreed  to  hold  a  dialogue  and  the
           government announced that it had agreed to one of the  El  Kseur
           demands, the inclusion of the Tamazight language in the national
           educational system.


      6.169 2004 In January 2004 the  Prime  Minister  announced  after  the
           talks that the government would study five of the six points  in
           the El Eseur list which were said to have been key  in  sparking
           the crisis.  He also announced  that  the  results  of  the  two
           elections in 2002 would be set  aside  in  areas  that  did  not
           participate normally in these polls.  Also in January the leader
           of the RCD party,  Said  Sadi  announced  that  he  would  be  a
           candidate in the presidential elections due to April 2004.


      6.170 However, the talks were reportedly suspended shortly  afterwards
           due to a disagreement over  the  status  of  Tamazight  and  the
           question of a referendum on the  subject.   The  Berber  leaders
           reportedly threatened to resume street protests and disrupt  the
           Presidential election.  As the election drew  near  it  appeared
           that the Berber leadership in Kabylia was divided  over  whether
           to boycott the poll.

18.   It is clear that elements in the Berber Community are not  happy  with
      their lot, but there is a  dialogue  between  representatives  of  the
      Berber Community and the Authorities.  It is also  apparent  that  the
      security  forces  act  with  impunity  at  demonstrations,   including
      demonstrations by Berbers.

19.   In this case, the appellant did not claim to  be  a  Berber  activist,
      involved in Berber issues, or even interested in them.

20.   Even if the Adjudicator's blanket adverse credibility finding did  not
      cover the appellant's claims to have been ill-treated because  of  his
      Berber ethnicity and he was beaten  by  the  local  Gendarmes  on  two
      occasions, he has not suggested that they have any continuing interest
      in him.

21.   The country information  does  not  show  that  if  the  appellant  is
      returned to his home area or to any other part of  Algeria  he  be  is
      liberty to risk of persecution or infringement  of  his  human  rights
      because of his Berber ethnicity.  The  country  information  does  not
      show that Berbers are at risk in Algeria  absent  any  individual  and
      particular reason for having  excited  the  adverse  interest  of  the
      authorities.

22.   We dismiss this appeal.


                                                                 P R Moulden
