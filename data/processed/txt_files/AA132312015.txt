                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, MB, date of birth [ ] 1999, is a citizen of Albania.

 2. This is his appeal against the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Wellesley-Cole promulgated 12.4.16, dismissing his appeal  against  the
    decision of the Secretary of State to refuse his  asylum,  humanitarian
    protection and human rights claims.  The  Judge  heard  the  appeal  on
    7.3.16.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge Ford granted permission to appeal on 28.4.16.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 3.6.16 as  an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the decision of Judge Wellesley-Cole should be set aside.

 6. The relevant background can be summarised  as  follows.  The  appellant
    claims that he was physically abused at home by his  father.  With  the
    assistance of his mother he came  to  the  UK,  arriving  by  lorry  on
    21.11.14. He fears that on return to Albania he  would  suffer  further
    harm or death at the hands of his father.

 7. The Secretary of State accepted the appellant's account of difficulties
    with his father and decided that the appellant  qualified  for  limited
    leave to remain as an  unaccompanied  asylum-seeking  child,  until  he
    reached the age of seventeen and a  half,  on  19.12.16.  However,  the
    Secretary of State does not accept that  he  qualifies  for  asylum  or
    humanitarian protection. She considered not  unreasonable  for  him  to
    relocate within Albania, to avoid problems with his  father.  She  also
    considered that there is sufficient  protection  available  to  him  in
    Albania so that there is no real risk of persecution or serious harm.

 8. The Secretary of State also considered that the appellant has no family
    life in the UK and he does not qualify  under  either  Appendix  FM  or
    paragraph 276ADE in relation to  private  and  family  life  under  the
    Immigration Rules. There are no exceptional (compelling  circumstances)
    to justify consideration of leave to remain outside the  Rules  on  the
    basis of article 8 ECHR.

 9. Judge Wellesley-Cole noted that the  appellant's  credibility  was  not
    impugned and he was not cross-examined at the appeal hearing. The issue
    was whether he could safely return to Albania. The judge found that the
    facts of  the  case  do  not  engage  the  Convention  or  humanitarian
    protection, as his father is a non-state actor, there is a  sufficiency
    of protection, and he can internally relocate. The judge noted that  he
    would not be removed until he is 17�, but accepted  that  the  relevant
    date of assessment was the date of hearing.

10. In respect of private  and  family  life,  the  judge  found  that  the
    appellant does not come within Appendix  FM  or  paragraph  276ADE  and
    there are no very significant obstacles to his integration in  Albania.
    At �19 the judge did not accept that he had family life in the UK,  and
    found no compelling  circumstances  insufficiently  recognised  in  the
    Rules so as to justify allowing him leave to remain outside  the  Rules
    on the basis that to remove him would be unjustifiably harsh, following
    SS (Congo) & Ors [2015] EWCA Civ 387.  The judge found that  article  8
    was not engaged and would not be breached by the appellant's return  to
    Albania.

11. The grounds of appeal set out a number of criticisms of the decision of
    the First-tier Tribunal, which in granting permission to appeal,  Judge
    Ford found arguable:

      a) That the judge applied an incorrect standard of proof at  �6,  that
         of balance of probabilities;

      b) That the judge assessed the risk at age 17 �  rather  than  at  the
         date of hearing;

      c) That the judge failed to consider whether the appellant had  formed
         a family life with his foster parents;

12. In granting permission to appeal Judge Ford found not arguable:

      a) That having found that the risk emanated from non-state actors  and
         that there was a sufficiency of protection the Tribunal found  that
         the article 2 and 3 claim fell with the asylum claim.  Whilst  this
         is not a  statement  of  general  principle,  the  grounds  do  not
         identify an independent article 2 or 3  claim.  At  �14  the  judge
         rejected the asylum  claim  and  at  �15  the  judge  rejected  the
         qualification claim. On the facts of this case, article 2 & 3  were
         always going to stand  or  fall  with  the  protection  claim.  The
         protection claim failed and article 2 and 3 were dismissed in  line
         with the protection claim.

      b) That the judge  failed  to  consider  the  best  interests  of  the
         appellant as a child, pursuant to section 55 of the BCIA 2009. This
         was considered by the judge at �12 of the decision;

      c) That the judge found that article 8 was not engage  in  respect  of
         private life.

13. In relation to the incorrect statement of the standard of proof at  �6,
    I find this error is not material, as there was no dispute  as  to  the
    appellant's factual claim, the judge noting that  his  credibility  was
    not impugned. I find that applying the correct standard of proof  would
    have made no difference at all to the outcome of the appeal.

14. I am not satisfied  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  incorrectly
    assessed the risk on return as being when the appellant reached the age
    of 17 �. It is clear from �6, �10 and �12  that  the  judge  was  fully
    aware that the assessment had to be made as at the date of the hearing,
    merely observing that he would not in fact be  removed  until  reaching
    the age of 17 �. At �10 the judge noted that the appellant is  still  a
    minor and his representative's submission that he would be at  risk  on
    return as there were not adequate  reception  facilities  for  him  and
    there is a risk of child trafficking. At  �12  the  judge  stated  that
    account had been taken of the appellant's youth. In the  circumstances,
    I am satisfied that the findings on both sufficiency of protection  and
    internal relocation  were  made  on  the  basis  of  the  circumstances
    prevailing at the date of the appeal  hearing.  There  is  no  material
    error of law in respect of this ground.

15. I find no error in the judge's finding  that  the  appellant's  factual
    claim, that he came to the UK because of ill-treatment by  his  father,
    which was accepted by the  Secretary  of  State,  did  not  engage  the
    Refugee Convention. The judge rejected the submission that the  reasons
    for fearing return to Albania  fell  within  Convention  and  that  the
    appellant was not part of a particular social  group.  The  grounds  in
    this regard are a mere disagreement.

16. The judge was not satisfied that there was  any  family  life  in  this
    case. The asserted family life was with a  foster  parent  or  parents.
    Whilst it was accepted that the appellant has a good relationship  with
    his foster family, one might say that the relationship  was  precarious
    and always going to be temporary pending the appellant's  removal  from
    the UK. The relationship does not come within the Appendix FM  criteria
    for leave to remain on the basis of family life. Fostering  may  engage
    article 8 private life and Mr Wilding pointed to the Rules which  refer
    to parental responsibility. However, in R (Mithokozisi) v  SSHD  [2004]
    EWHC 296 (Admin) the High Court found that a man did not have protected
    family life with his foster parents. In R (on the application of Aliyu)
    [2014] EWHC 3919 it was held on a Judicial Review application  that  it
    was arguable that children's relationship with an aunt with  whom  they
    loved and who was in a de  facto  parental  position  could  constitute
    family life. Mr Karim could point me  to  no  case  authority  on  this
    issue.

17. In the circumstances, it was open to the judge to find that family life
    was not engaged on the facts of this case. At the date of  hearing  the
    appellant could only have been with his foster family a short period of
    time, a little over a year and there was no  evidence  of  particularly
    strong emotional ties. I cannot find that the  judge's  conclusion  was
    irrational, perverse or  one  which  no  reasonable  judge  could  have
    reached.

18. In any event, the grounds in relation to article 8 are  irrelevant,  as
    there is no removal decision and no threatened breach of his family and
    private life at the present time, which is when the  assessment  should
    be made. The appellant has discretionary leave until the age of  17  �,
    at which time he is free to renew his asylum  claim  and  assert  human
    rights, including alleged family and  private  life  under  article  8.
    There is no error of law in respect of this ground.

19. I find that this appeal is without merit, focusing  on  minor  forensic
    criticisms of particular findings or the methodology of the  First-tier
    Tribunal with no regard to the overall issues to be  resolved  and  the
    basic legal test which the appellant has to  meet,  as  stated  in  VHR
    (unmeritorious grounds) Jamaica [2014] UKUT 367 (IAC).

Conclusions:

20. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should
    be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed on all grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. Mr Karim sought an anonymity direction. The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make  an  order.  However,  given  the  appellant's  age  I
consider it appropriate to protect his identity.
Given the circumstances, I make an anonymity order.




Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: No fee is payable in this case and thus there can be no fee award.
