Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr J Trussler of Counsel, instructed by Messrs Kinas
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr N Bramble, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer



                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellants appeal with permission against a decision  of  Judge  of
    the First-tier Tribunal J W H Law who, in a  determination  promulgated
    on 29 June 2018, dismissed their appeals  against  a  decision  of  the
    Secretary of State dated 8 February 2017to  refuse  their  applications
    for further leave to remain on family and private life grounds.

2.   The appellants are citizens of Turkey who were granted entry  clearance
    to enter Britain to join the first appellant's husband and  the  father
    of the second and third appellants, a son  born  in  July  2001  and  a
    daughter born in March 2003,  in  Britain  as  his  dependants.   Their
    father Murat [A] was granted indefinite leave to remain in 2009 and  is
    a British citizen.

3.   The appellants were granted leave to remain until 9 February 2017.   It
    is accepted that the first appellant and the sponsor were in a  genuine
    relationship and the other appellants were their children, but  it  was
    not accepted that the sponsor  had  sufficient  funds  to  support  the
    appellants under the provisions of Appendix FM and furthermore that  it
    was not accepted that there were insurmountable obstacles in accordance
    with paragraph EX2 of Appendix FM to  the  family  living  together  in
    Turkey.

4.    The  respondent  considered  that  there  would  not  be   significant
    obstacles to integration for the first appellant into Turkey  which  is
    where she had lived until she was 36 and similarly  it  was  considered
    that the children would be able to continue their education there.   It
    was pointed out that the children had not lived in  Britain  for  seven
    years.

5.   At the hearing of the appeal before the judge it was accepted that  the
    sponsor's financial situation had worsened since he was joined  by  the
    appellants and the  family  therefore  could  not  meet  the  financial
    requirements for settlement as a family.

6.   The judge said that he proceeded on the  basis  that  the  sponsor  was
    still a refugee but given  that  he  had  returned  to  Turkey  in  the
    meantime in both 2013 and 2014 and would go every other  year  when  he
    could afford to do so thee judge went on to find  that  there  were  no
    insurmountable obstacles to his living with his family in Turkey.   The
    judge did consider the issue of the children and their studies here but
    stated that there was no evidence to show that they could not  continue
    their education in Turkey.  On those bases he found that not only could
    the appellants not meet the terms of Appendix  FM  but  also  that  the
    decision to refuse the application was proportionate.

7.   At the hearing of the appeal before me Mr Trussler  produced  a  bundle
    of documents which showed that  the  income  of  the  sponsor  and  the
    appellant together now met the financial requirements of the Rules.  It
    was accepted that when the application was made and at the time of  the
    hearing before the judge, the financial requirements could not be met -
    their total income at that stage had been together �17,085.  However he
    produced evidence to show that  both  the  sponsor  and  the  principal
    appellant were now earning �1,050 per month.  That  being  a  total  of
    �25,200 a year.

8.   He argued, in accordance with the grounds of appeal  which  had  stated
    that the judge had considered  the  insurmountable  obstacles  test  in
    isolation from the second and third appellants, that the judge had been
    wrong in his consideration of the impact of removal on  the  second  or
    third appellants, given that the second  appellant  was  now  attending
    college and the third appellant was now beginning her GCSE course.   He
    argued that the judge had not properly considered that issue.

9.   Mr Bramble referred  to  the  determination  in  which  the  judge  has
    specifically referred to Section 55 of  the  Borders,  Citizenship  and
    Immigration Act 2009 and the judgment in ZH Tanzania v SSHD [2011] UKSC
    4 and argued that the judge was e  entitled  to  consider  that  little
    weight should be given to the children's private life here since  2014,
    given that neither were qualifying children.  The judge had noted  that
    there  was  no  expert  evidence  from  an  independent  social  worker
    regarding the impact of removal on the children and said  that  he  had
    taken into account letters from teachers at their school and  from  the
    children on the possible effect on their education.

10.  Mr Bramble argued that this was a  case  where  permission  should  not
    have been granted - the grant of permission by Judge of the First-tier
    Tribunal Blundell had said that the judge had failed to  make  a  clear
    finding on the best interests of the second and  third  appellants  and
    had failed to undertake a legally adequate assessment of the weight  of
    the public interest in removal of the appellants.

11.  Mr Bramble argued that the judge had properly considered the  issue  of
    the children and in particular the impact on them of their  removal  to
    Turkey and stated in light of the determination it could  not  be  said
    that the judge had not considered all relevant factors.

Discussion

12.  I consider that the judge did properly consider  all  relevant  factors
    and was entitled to conclude that  there  would  be  no  insurmountable
    obstacles to the family continuing their family life in  Turkey,  given
    that the three appellants have lived there for  practically  all  their
    lives and that the sponsor lived there for also  the  majority  of  his
    life.  I consider that therefore the judge did  consider  all  relevant
    factors and that therefore his decision should stand.  However I  would
    add  that  the  evidence  before  me  indicated  that   the   financial
    requirements of Appendix FM could now be met and that  being  the  case
    the appellants would now all meet  the  relevant  requirements  of  the
    Rules.

13.  I therefore consider that  when  a  further  application  is  made  and
    evidence is provided of the sponsor's earnings that the decision of the
    Secretary of State might well be in  favour  of  the  appellants.   The
    further earnings are not something that I can  take  into  account  now
    because I have not found an error of law in the  determination  of  the
    First-tier Judge, but that evidence must be considered by the Secretary
    of State and indeed the  change  of  circumstances  is  such  that  the
    further application should certainly be considered as a fresh claim.

Notice of Decision

The determination of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.

No anonymity direction is made.
