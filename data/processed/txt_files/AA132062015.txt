                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, TS, date of birth [ ], is a citizen of Sri Lanka.

 2. This is his appeal against the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Cameron promulgated 15.4.16,  dismissing  on  all  grounds  his  appeal
    against the decision of the Secretary of State to  refuse  his  asylum,
    humanitarian protection and human rights claims.  The Judge  heard  the
    appeal on 30.3.16.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge Robertson granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    25.5.16.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 5.7.16 as  an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. For the reasons briefly summarised below, I found no error  of  law  in
    the making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  such  as  to
    require the decision of Judge Cameron to be set aside.

 6. The relevant background to the asylum claim can be  briefly  summarised
    as follows. The appellant claimed an involvement with the LTTE back  to
    2003, with a number of arrests and detentions in 2003  or  2004,  2008,
    and 2009. He in fact left Sri Lanka in 2004 and  claimed  asylum  in  a
    false identity in France, which was refused and he was returned to  Sri
    Lanka in 2006. He escaped from detention and  was  rearrested  in  June
    2010, during which time he was severely mistreated and  put  to  forced
    labour. He was freed in November 2010 on payment  of  a  bribe  by  his
    uncle. He came to the  UK  in  December  2011  and  claimed  asylum  on
    31.1.11. He fears that on return to Sri Lanka he will  be  killed.  The
    Secretary of State did not accept his claimed LTTE involvement.

 7. In an extensive, careful and detailed decision, Judge Cameron  accepted
    the appellant's account  about  his  detention  and  that  the  claimed
    mistreatment was consistent with the  objective  and  expert  evidence.
    However, in considering the risk on return, Judge Cameron  applied  the
    GJ (post-civil war; returnees) Sri Lanka CG  [2013]  UKUT  00319  (IAC)
    risk categories, as well as the appellant's sur place  activities.  The
    judge found it clear that the Sri  Lankan  authorities  would  have  no
    knowledge of his diaspora activities, which were of very low level. The
    judge concluded that the appellant had failed  to  demonstrate  to  the
    lower standard of proof that the Sri Lankan authorities would have  any
    adverse interest in him now, as the focus is now on  identifying  Tamil
    activists in the diaspora  working  towards  Tamil  separatism  and  to
    destabilise the unitary Sri Lankan state. There was nothing, the  judge
    found, to indicate that he is or would be perceived as an activist such
    as to be of interest to the authorities and thus the judge concluded he
    did not meet any of the GJ risk factors.

 8. In granting permission to appeal, Judge  Robertson  found  it  arguable
    that the  judge  did  not  consider  whether  the  appellant  would  be
    questioned on return at the airport, whether he would then disclose his
    diaspora activities, and did not address how this would  be  viewed  in
    the context of the past interest in him of the Sri Lankan  authorities,
    in view of the credibility findings made  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge and the appellant's previous lengthy detention in 2010.

 9. Judge Robertson found no arguable merit in  the  remaining  grounds  of
    appeal. In particular, there was no merit in the argument that that the
    judge erred in concluding that given his low profile,  the  Sri  Lankan
    authorities would not be aware  of  his  sur  place  activities.  Judge
    Robertson considered that the findings relating to these other  grounds
    of appeal were open to the judge  and  were  neither  unreasonable  nor
    irrational. I  endorse  and  adopt  the  reasoning  of  part  of  Judge
    Robertson's permission to appeal. Ms Bronwen-Jones did not pursue these
    other grounds of appeal, only the single  issue  relating  to  risk  on
    return.

10. The Rule 24 response, dated 16.6.16, submits that  the  judge  directed
    himself appropriately. In light of the findings that the appellant  was
    of no interest to the authorities since his departure from Sri Lanka in
    2011 and that the authorities would not be aware of his UK  activities,
    "it is submitted that the questioning of the appellant referred  to  by
    the judge would not place the appellant at risk  as  he  would  not  be
    perceived as a person attempting to destabilise the  unitary  state  of
    Sri Lanka or working for Tamil separation. There is  no  evidence  from
    the appellant to suggest if he failed to fall  into  a  risk  category,
    that questions at the airport would  be  anything  other  than  general
    immigration checks. The judge directed himself appropriately  and  made
    findings which were open to him on the evidence and  in  light  of  the
    country guidance caselaw. Furthermore, it is submitted that the limited
    evidence relied upon by the appellant in his appeal would not have been
    sufficient to warrant the judge to depart  from  the  findings  in  the
    country guidance cases."

11. Ms Bronwen-Jones relied on paragraph 339K, to the effect that the  fact
    that a person has already been subject to persecution or serious  harm,
    etc., will be regarded as a serious indication of  the  person's  well-
    founded fear of persecution or real risk  of  suffering  serious  harm,
    unless there are good reasons to  consider  that  such  persecution  or
    serious harm will not be repeated. However, the judge  took  this  into
    account at �120, but given the change in emphasis  of  the  Sri  Lankan
    authorities, was not satisfied that the  previous  detention  and  ill-
    treatment would be sufficient to raise a real risk on return now. It is
    suggested that this was an error of law, because the change of emphasis
    has only applied since the end of the civil war, not since 2010.

12. The grounds suggest that although the judge  found  at  �113  that  the
    appellant was detained in  2010  when  he  did  not  have  the  correct
    paperwork, it is highly likely  that  during  his  detention  his  past
    profile as a LTTE member and suspected fighter would have come  to  the
    attention of the authorities, and that he was  held  in  detention  for
    such a long period suggests that it was not simply part  of  a  routine
    round-up  and  not  having  the  correct  paperwork.   However,   these
    suggestions are mere speculation.

13. On the basis of Ms Bronwen-Jones'  submissions,  anyone  who  had  been
    previously detained by the Sri Lankan authorities  for  suspected  LTTE
    involvement would be entitled to succeed in an asylum claim, for  which
    she claims support from the more recent country background  information
    set out at �13 of the grounds. That cannot be an accurate statement  of
    the  current  situation,  bearing  in  mind  the  case  law.  There  is
    insufficient here to justify  the  judge  departing  from  the  current
    country guidance in relation to Sri Lanka, on the found  facts  of  the
    appellant's case.

14. I am satisfied that the judge carefully considered the  case  law,  set
    out between �105-108 and  carefully  addressed  whether  the  appellant
    would be perceived as a Tamil activist. In making that  assessment  the
    judge addressed a series of relevant factors: at �110  that  there  has
    been no recent activity looking for him;  at  �111  that  there  is  no
    evidence of continuing interest; at �112 the passage of time;  at  �114
    the brother's LTTE involvement, but death a number of years before  his
    last detention, and that he was twice released on payment of  a  bribe;
    and at �115 that there is no evidence that he is on a warrant  or  stop
    list, or the subject of an arrest warrant.  On  the  judge's  findings,
    there would be no reason to question him about his  low-level  diaspora
    activities in the UK and no reason for the appellant to  disclose  that
    or any other matter which would give rise to adverse interest in him on
    return to Sri Lanka, despite the updated country background referred to
    at �13 of the grounds of application for permission to appeal.

15. Whilst a different judge may have reached  a  different  conclusion  to
    those at �109 and �121, on the limited evidence they were findings open
    to the judge and for which cogent reasons have been given. The findings
    were properly reasoned and are neither irrational nor perverse.

Conclusions:

16. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should
    be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed on all grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did make  an  order.  Given  the  circumstances,  I  continue  that
anonymity order.

Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: No fee is payable in this case.
