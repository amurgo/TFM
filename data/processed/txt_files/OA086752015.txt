Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr T Wilding, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent: Mr T Shah, solicitor, Taj solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background

    1. This is an appeal by the Respondent Entry Clearance Officer ("ECO").
        For ease of reference I refer to the parties as they  were  in  the
       First-tier Tribunal even though strictly the ECO is the Appellant in
       this Tribunal.


    2. The Respondent appeals against a  decision  of  First-Tier  Tribunal
       Judge I Ross  promulgated  on  24  February  2017  ("the  Decision")
       allowing the Appellant's appeal against  the  Respondent's  decision
       dated 1 May 2015 refusing her entry clearance as  the  spouse  of  a
       person settled in the UK.


    3. The Appellant is a Bangladeshi national.  She applies  to  join  her
       husband, Mr Saleh Ahmed ("the Sponsor") who is settled  in  the  UK.
       She  made  an  application  on  18  February  2015  refused  by  the
       Respondent's decision under appeal.


    4. The Respondent refused the Appellant's application for two  reasons,
       both connected with the Sponsor's income.  The  Respondent  was  not
       satisfied that the Sponsor was earning  the  income  stated  in  the
       application.  It  was  also  noted  that  the  information  provided
       regarding  the  Sponsor's  earnings  conflicted   with   information
       received from HMRC.


    5. The Respondent's decision was  maintained  by  the  Entry  Clearance
       Manager ("ECM") on 10 September 2015.  He  placed  emphasis  on  the
       second of the reasons given.  He indicated that further verification
       checks were made to HMRC following receipt of the appeal bundle  and
       that as  a  result  of  that  information  he  was  "satisfied  that
       employment  has  been  contrived  for  the  purposes  of  this  visa
       application".


    6. The Judge allowed the appeal on the basis that  the  Respondent  had
       incorrectly calculated the Sponsor's  income.   On  that  basis  and
       because he thought that there was  no  issue  as  to  the  Sponsor's
       income, he concluded that the Appellant met the  provisions  of  the
       Immigration Rules and accordingly, found that the decision to refuse
       entry was a disproportionate interference with  the  couple's  human
       rights.


    7. The Respondent appeals on two grounds.  The  first  relates  to  the
       allegation of dishonesty made by reference to the HMRC  information.
       It is said that  the  Judge  gave  no  reasons  for  preferring  the
       evidence of the Appellant over that of the Respondent.   The  second
       relates to the assertion that there was no issue as to the Sponsor's
       income.  It was pointed out that the reasons  for  refusal  included
       that the Appellant could not meet the minimum income requirement.


    8. Permission was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge M  Robertson  in
       the following terms (so far as relevant):-


            "2.  It is arguable, as submitted  in  the  grounds,  that  the
           Judge has not  given  adequate  reasons,  by  reference  to  the
           evidence before him, for accepting the Appellant's  evidence  as
           to his gross annual income in preference to the  enquiries  made
           by the Respondent from HMRC.  It is not clear from [4], and  [7]
           the periods of time during which the Appellant was  employed  at
           Wild Mango (which changed its name to  Tiger  Coast)  and  Spice
           Curry.  It is therefore arguable that it is not clear  from  the
           decision how the Judge reached his decision."


    9. The matter comes before me to decide whether the Decision contains a
       material error of law and, if so, to re-make the decision  or  remit
       the appeal for rehearing to the First-Tier Tribunal.




    Submissions


   10. Mr Wilding focussed his submissions on the second  of  the  grounds.
       He was right to do so.  The Respondent's decision  and  particularly
       the review decision  of  the  ECM,  in  relation  to  the  deception
       allegation, focusses on changes of employment which it is said  that
       the Appellant and Sponsor had failed  to  declare  as  a  change  of
       circumstances.  However, as the Judge pointed  out  at  [7]  of  the
       Decision, this arose from confusion caused by the change of name  of
       one of the restaurants at which the Sponsor was working.


   11. The second ground turns on whether the Appellant is able to meet the
       minimum income requirements of Appendix FM.   It  is  common  ground
       that the income which she is required to show is �18,600.


   12. Mr Jarvis did not take issue with what the Judge said at [7] of  the
       Decision concerning the wrong calculation made by the ECO  based  on
       the HMRC evidence.  However, he submitted that the  Appellant's  own
       calculations are also wrong and do not permit her to  succeed  under
       Appendix FM applying Appendix FM-SE.


   13. The Appellant relied in her  application  on  the  Sponsor's  income
       being �20,150.  That is based on a calculation carried  out  by  her
       solicitors in a letter dated 18 February 2015 which states so far as
       relevant:-
            "FINANCIAL REQUIREMENT AND MAINTENANCE
           The Sponsor is at present working for Wild Mango  Limited.   His
           position is a Second Chef.
           The Sponsor is also working part-time as a Second Chef for Spicy
           Curry Inn trading as Curry Inn.
           Please consider his both  [sic]  employer  letters,  pay  slips,
           confirming his employment with them and that his last  6  months
           wages  were  deposited  to  bank  account  which   satisfy   the
           Immigration Rules
            Wild Mango Limited:-
           Sponsor is getting salary every 4  weeks.   We  have  calculated
           from the Sponsor's lowest gross (before tax) salary of the  last
           6 months of:
            �950.00 monthly payslip �4 weeks x 52 weeks a year =
            �12,350 annual gross income
            Spicy Curry Inn trading as Curry Inn:-
           We have calculated from the Sponsor's lowest gross (before  tax)
           salary of the last 6 months of:
            �600 monthly payslip �4 weeks x 52 weeks a year =
            �7800 annual gross income
            Therefore the combined salary a total of
            (�12,350.00 + �7,800)"


   14.  As Mr Wilding points out, there are not four weeks in every  month.
       As such, he submitted that  the  calculation  wrongly  inflates  the
       figure for  earnings.   He  also  pointed  out  how  Appendix  FM-SE
       requires the calculation to  be  made.   The  Sponsor  has  been  in
       employment for over six months and is therefore entitled to rely  on
       six months' pay slips.  Paragraph 13 of Appendix FM-SE requires  the
       calculation to be made as follows:-


                       .....



                 Calculating Gross Annual Income under Appendix FM


            13.  Based on evidence  that  meets  the  requirements  of  this
           Appendix, and can be taken into account with  reference  to  the
           applicable provisions of Appendix FM, gross annual income  .....
           will be calculated in the following ways:
            (a)  Where the person is in salaried employment  in  the  UK  at
                       the date of application, has been employed  by  their
                       current employer for at least six months and has been
                       paid throughout the period of six months prior to the
                       date of application at a level of gross annual salary
                       which equals or exceeds  the  level  relied  upon  in
                       paragraph 13(a)(i), their gross annual income will be
                       (where paragraph 13(b) does not apply) the total of:
            (i)  the level  of  gross  annual  salary  relied  upon  in  the
                       application..[my emphasis]
            (b)  Where the person is in salaried employment  in  the  UK  at
                       the date of application  and  has  been  employed  by
                       their current employer for less than 6 months (or  at
                       least 6 months  but  the  person  does  not  rely  on
                       paragraph 13(a)), their gross annual income  will  be
                       the total of:
            (i)  the gross annual salary from employment as it  was  at  the
                       date     of     application;      [my      emphasis]"




   15. Mr Wilding pointed out that the Appellant having been  employed  for
       more than six months and relying on what is said to be six months of
       payslips must be applying under paragraph 13(a)  of  Appendix  FM-SE
       and not paragraph 13(b).  Mr  Shah  did  not  dissent.   Mr  Wilding
       pointed out the distinction  (as  I  have  emphasised)  in  the  two
       provisions.  One is to support a calculation of  the  figure  relied
       upon in the application.  The other is to support a  calculation  of
       the figure at date of application.  Reliance on paragraph 13(a)  has
       the effect, Mr Wilding submitted, of requiring the Appellant to show
       that the Sponsor earns at least �20,150.  It is not enough  he  says
       for the Appellant to show that the Sponsor earns �18,600 by  way  of
       the payslips as she has relied in her application  on  a  figure  of
       �20,150.


   16. Mr Wilding did accept though that since the Appellant  has  to  show
       under Appendix FM that the Sponsor earns at  least  �18,600,  if  he
       does in fact earn that amount,  that  is  relevant  to  whether  the
       Appellant should succeed applying Article 8 ECHR.


   17. Mr Shah in reply did  not  accept  that  the  Sponsor's  income  was
       wrongly calculated and drew my attention to the payslips  which  are
       appended to a letter dated 15 February 2017 addressed to Judge  Ross
       although unfortunately not copied to the  Respondent.   He  did  not
       though take me to what those payslips show  or  the  detail  of  the
       calculation.  Since that letter was not copied to the Respondent, Mr
       Wilding did not have a copy of these documents on file  although  he
       had been shown them  immediately  before  the  hearing.   Since  the
       detail of those documents is not referred to in the Decision  (which
       is perhaps why the Respondent has appealed as she has on  the  basis
       that she does not understand the Judge's reasoning) I will  need  to
       deal with that detail when I come to consider the documents below.


   18. Mr Shah submitted that  in  any  event  the  issue  is  whether  the
       Appellant meets the minimum income requirement in Appendix FM  which
       is accepted to be �18,600.  He did not  accept  that  the  Appellant
       could not meet Appendix FM-SE if the documents  show  an  income  of
       less  than  �20,150  although  he  did  not  offer  any  alternative
       interpretation of paragraph 13(a) to that put forward by Mr Wilding.


   19. Mr Shah also directed my attention to the Supreme  Court's  judgment
       in MM (Lebanon) and  others  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
       Department  [2017]  UKSC  10   and   the   Immigration   Directorate
       Instructions revised in October 2017 as a result of  that  judgment.
       He submitted that, based on those documents, the essential issue  is
       whether refusal of entry clearance breaches the Appellant's (and the
       Sponsor's) Article 8 rights.  He pointed out that the Respondent has
       not raised any ground of challenge in relation to  the  allowing  of
       the appeal under Article 8 ECHR.  It is though of  course  the  case
       (as Mr Wilding pointed out) that the Judge depends in his Article  8
       analysis on the Appellant meeting the Immigration Rules.  If in fact
       the Judge has materially erred in  his  analysis  of  the  financial
       requirements, then the  balance  in  Article  8  would  need  to  be
       revisited.


   20. It is of course the case that if I find a material error of  law  in
       the Decision, I would then consider whether it should be  set  aside
       and, if I  set  it  aside,  it  would  follow  that  the  Article  8
       assessment would  have  to  be  re-made.   The  Respondent  has  not
       challenged the Judge's findings which  are  relevant  to  Article  8
       other than whether the Appellant meets the  financial  requirements.
       That is a matter  which  I  may  need  to  take  into  account  when
       considering the materiality of any error and  when  reassessing  the
       Article 8 balance if I do find a material error of law.


      Error of law discussion and decision


   21. With that summary of submissions, I now turn to  what  the  Decision
       and the documents show.  The documents appended to the  15  February
       2017 letter are:-
           1) A letter dated 26 February 2015 from Wild Mango Ltd;
           2) Payslips from Wild Mango Ltd from  14  September  2014  to  1
              February 2015
           3) A letter dated 27 February 2015 from Spicy Curry Inn Ltd
           4) Payslips from that employer dated  14  September  2014  to  1
              February 2015


   22. No issue was taken by the ECO or ECM in their decisions  as  to  the
       compliance of the employers' letters with Appendix FM-SE.  The  only
       issue which is taken relates to the  genuineness  of  employment  in
       light of the HMRC documents which, as I have already noted  at  [10]
       above and as the Judge found arose from a confusion about the change
       of name of the company.  For the sake  of  completeness,  though,  I
       note that Wild Mango Ltd confirms that the Sponsor  has  worked  for
       that company since  23  June  2014  as  a  second  chef.   He  works
       permanently for 25 hours a week  and  his  yearly  gross  salary  is
       �12,350 which is paid every four weeks in the sum of �950  gross  by
       cheque.  That is confirmed by the six payslips which follow.


   23. The letter from Spicy Curry Inn Ltd (trading as Curry Inn)  confirms
       that the Sponsor has been employed by Spicy Curry Inn Ltd  since  23
       June 2014 as an assistant chef.  He works part-time on  a  permanent
       basis.  His annual gross salary is �7,800 paid by cheque every  four
       weeks.  That too is confirmed  by  the  six  payslips  which  follow
       (which each show a gross payment of �600).


   24. A point which was not evident from the submissions at the hearing is
       that the payslips and letters confirm that the Sponsor is paid four-
       weekly and not monthly.  The dates of the payslips are 14  September
       2014, 12 October 2014, 9 November 2014, 7 December 2014,  4  January
       2015 and 1 February 2015.  That is  no  doubt  the  reason  why  the
       Appellant's solicitors carried out the calculation which  they  did.
       There is no error in that calculation.


   25. I do not attach any blame to Mr Wilding for his submission that  the
       calculation was in error since he  did  not  have  the  payslips  or
       letters before him.  One might have expected that Mr Shah would have
       picked up the point since his firm provided the documents.  However,
       as a matter of fact the calculation carried out is correct  and  the
       point about compliance with paragraph 13(a)(i) falls away insofar as
       that requires the Appellant to show the amount relied  upon  in  the
       application.  The payslips  when  extrapolated  to  a  gross  annual
       figure do show a figure of �20,150.


   26. However, this  evidence  then  raises  a  different  issue  of  non-
       compliance with Appendix FM-SE.  As  the  evidence  now  shows,  the
       Appellant has not in fact produced six months  of  payslips.   There
       are six payslips each relating to a different month but they do  not
       in fact cover a period  of  six  months  prior  to  the  application
       (because they relate to payments every  four  weeks  and  not  every
       month).  The application was made on 18 February 2015.  A period  of
       six months dating back from that date would be 18 August 2014.   The
       earliest payslip is dated 14 September 2014.


   27. Paragraph 2(a) of Appendix FM-SE requires the provision of "Payslips
       covering (i) a  period  of  6  months  prior  to  the  date  of  the
       application if  the  person  has  been  employed  by  their  current
       employer  for  at  least  6  months".   As   such,   on   a   strict
       interpretation of Appendix FM-SE, the  Appellant  has  not  complied
       with that requirement. She would have to provide the payslip  before
       the earliest payslip which was provided.


   28. That though is not the end of the matter.  Appendix  FM-SE  contains
       its own evidential flexibility requirements. Of course, in this case
       the ECO and ECM  did  not  consider  whether  it  was  necessary  to
       exercise discretion to request missing documents because  they  were
       of the view that the employment was not in any event  genuine  based
       on the information from HMRC.  The application would therefore  have
       failed for that reason.  However, now that  this  point  has  fallen
       away,  the  question  arises  whether  the  evidential   flexibility
       discretion might have fallen to be applied in this case.


   29.  Paragraph  D(b)(i)(aa)  permits  the  decision-maker   to   request
       documents if one in a sequence is missing.   I  recognise  that  the
       situation here is slightly different; the Appellant  has  failed  to
       provide one payslip at the start of the sequence and  not  within  a
       sequence.  However, read with the employer's letters  which  confirm
       that the Sponsor had been employed since June 2014,  it  would  have
       been evident that there should be a payslip in  existence  prior  to
       the September payslip and the ECO/ECM might therefore have requested
       the  Appellant/Sponsor  to  provide  that,  particularly  since  (as
       appears to be the case) confusion was caused by the  payments  being
       made four-weekly rather than monthly.


   30. I am at this stage considering  whether  the  Decision  contains  an
       error of law.  I accept the Respondent's ground two that  the  Judge
       has erred in finding at [8] of the Decision that no issue was  taken
       with the sponsor's income.  In light of my  conclusions  about  what
       the documents show  though,  there  is  a  question  mark  over  the
       materiality of that error.


   31. The Judge was entitled to find that the ECO had  wrongly  calculated
       the income by reference to the  HMRC  information  rather  than  the
       payslips which (according to the letter dated 18 February 2015) were
       indeed produced. For the reasons stated at [27] above, the Judge was
       wrong to find that the Appellant satisfied the requirements  of  the
       Immigration Rules.  However, as I also point out at [29] above, this
       is a case where evidential flexibility might have  been  appropriate
       if the ECO/ECM had correctly understood the content  of  the  letter
       and documents submitted with the application  as  to  the  Sponsor's
       income rather than relying on the HMRC information.


   32. This is an appeal which post-dates the  coming  into  force  of  the
       Immigration Act 2014. Although the entry clearance  application  was
       made before  6  April  2015  and  was  pending  at  that  date,  the
       application  includes  a  human  rights  claim.   The   transitional
       provisions do not therefore apply.  Since the Respondent's  decision
       was made after 6 April 2015, the appeal provisions  amended  by  the
       Immigration Act 2014 apply.  Accordingly,  what  the  Judge  had  to
       decide was whether the appeal should succeed under Article 8 ECHR.


   33. There is no challenge to the genuineness of the relationship between
       the Appellant and her daughter (who is a British  citizen)  and  the
       Sponsor.  As  I  have  noted  above,  the  Appellant's   solicitor's
       calculation of  the  Sponsor's  income  was  in  fact  correct.  The
       documents  show  that  the  Appellant  meets  the   minimum   income
       requirement although not in strict compliance with Appendix FM-SE.


   34. This appeal concerns a request for entry clearance from a spouse and
       child who, as the Judge notes at [5] of the Decision "are  prevented
       from living together by the  refusal  decision".   Even  though  the
       Judge was wrong to say at [8] of the  Decision  that  the  Appellant
       satisfied the (strict) requirements of the Rules, the evidence shows
       that her spouse is earning the requisite level of income and  indeed
       the level of income claimed in the application.  The  non-compliance
       is very minor and, as I have noted, might have been overcome by  the
       exercise of evidential flexibility.


   35. For those reasons, I am satisfied that, although the Judge did  fall
       into error at [8] of the Decision, the error  is  not  material  and
       does not impact on his conclusion that the Appellant is entitled  to
       succeed under Article 8 ECHR on  the  basis  that  the  Respondent's
       decision is a disproportionate  interference  with  her  family  and
       private life.

DECISION
    I am satisfied that the Decision contains errors of law. However, those
    errors are not material.  For that reason, I decline to set  aside  the
    decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Ross promulgated on  24  February
    2017. The consequence is that the  Appellant's  appeal  is  allowed  on
    human rights grounds on the basis that removal of the  Appellant  would
    breach Article 8 ECHR.
