                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State.  However, for convenience
    I will refer to the parties as they were referred to in the First-tier
    Tribunal.

 2. The first appellant was born on 1 March 1973.  She is the mother of the
    second appellant, who was born on 24 August 1999.  Both appellants are
    citizens of India.

 3. The first appellant married a British Citizen ("the Sponsor") in
    December 2012.  She entered the UK with a spouse visa valid from 3
    December 2013 to 3 September 2016.  The second appellant entered with a
    dependant visa valid for the same period.

 4. On 29 August 2016 the appellants applied for leave to remain in the UK
    under Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules on the basis of their family
    life with the Sponsor.  The application was refused on 23 August 2017
    on the basis that the financial eligibility requirements were not met
    and there were not insurmountable obstacles to the relationship
    continuing in India.

 5. The appellants appealed to the First-tier Tribunal where their appeal
    was heard on 21 June 2018 by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Clarke.
    In a decision promulgated on 20 August 2018 their appeal was allowed.
    The Secretary of State is now appealing against that decision.

 6. Judge Clarke found that, although the financial requirements of
    Appendix FM were not satisfied when the application for leave under
    Appendix FM was made, at the date of the hearing they were met because
    the sponsor had earned ï¿½19,025 between 3 September 2017 and 21 June
    2018.  The judge found that because the appellants could now satisfy
    the Immigration Rules (and the failure to satisfy the financial
    requirements had been the only reason their application had been
    refused) there was no public interest in refusing leave to remain.

 7. The judge also considered whether the appellants should be required to
    leave the UK to apply leave to enter from India.  At paragraph 59 the
    judge stated:

         "I also find that there is no public interest in the appellants
         being required to return to India to make an entry clearance
         application when the first named appellant meets the Rules as of
         the date of the hearing.  In so finding, I remind myself of the
         application of the Chikwamba principles.  I find that the second
         named appellant will be unable to meet the Adult Dependant Relative
         Rules for entry clearance and therefore it is unlikely that she
         would obtain entry clearance but the consequence would be that
         there would be a fracturing of the Article 8 family life between
         the appellants.  The second named appellant is a dependant on her
         mother's claim and I find that her removal would be a
         disproportionate interference with family life".

 8. The Secretary of State appealed against the decision on the basis that
    the judge failed to take into consideration that the financial
    requirements of the Rules were not satisfied when the application was
    made and failed to consider the insurmountable obstacles test under
    EX.1 of Appendix FM.

 9. The grounds also contend that the judge has not explained or made clear
    how the requirements of Appendix FM-SE were satisfied as it is not
    sufficient to simply find that the Sponsor is earning an income that
    puts him above the financial threshold in Appendix FM.

10. The grounds also argue that the consideration of the second appellant's
    case was "manifestly perverse" because no consideration was given to
    why the family could not live together in India.

11. The issue before the First-tier Tribunal was whether removing the
    appellants from the UK would constitute a disproportionate interference
    with their right to respect for their private and family life.  This
    required a balancing exercise, with consideration being given, on the
    one side of the scales, to the public interest in their removal from
    the UK; and, on the other, to their individual interests.  A necessary
    part of this assessment was to assess the force of the public interest
    in their removal.

12. In Agyarko [2017] UKSC 11 the Supreme Court stated (at para 51):

         "[If] an applicant - even if residing in the UK unlawfully - was
         otherwise certain to be granted leave to enter, at least if an
         application were made from outside the UK, then there might be no
         public interest in his or her removal.  This is the point
         illustrated by the decision in Chikwamba v Secretary of State."
         (Emphasis added).

13. The judge considered evidence before him concerning the Sponsor's
    employment and made the finding of fact (which, having reviewed the
    bundle that was before the First-tier Tribunal, I am satisfied is
    consistent with the evidence) that the Sponsor's income was at a level
    where, if an application had been made at the time of the hearing, the
    financial eligibility requirements under Application FM would have been
    satisfied. The judge considered the implications of this - finding, at
    paragraph 53, that the appellants would not be a burden on the British
    taxpayer - and concluded that there is no public interest in
    maintaining the refusal of leave to remain.  The judge's conclusion as
    to the force of the public interest in the appellants' removal is not
    inconsistent with paragraph 51 of Agyarko and was open to him.

14. Having found that there was no public interest in removing the
    appellants because of the financial circumstances of the Sponsor which
    meant that the requirements of Appendix FM were met, it followed that
    the balancing exercise under Article 8 ECHR fell in favour of the
    appellants.  Accordingly, I am satisfied that the decision does not
    contain a material error of law.  The Secretary of State's appeal is
    therefore dismissed.
