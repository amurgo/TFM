For the Appellant:     Mr I Richards, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr A T Okunow, Supreme Solicitors


                          DECISION ON ERROR OF LAW

1.   On 20 June of this year Ramotalai Sobande appeared  before  the  First-
    tier Tribunal in Birmingham.  The Tribunal  determined  in  her  favour
    that both she and her eldest child had established a  private  life  in
    this country under the Immigration  Rules  and  therefore  allowed  her
    appeal against the Secretary of State's refusal to give  her  leave  to
    remain.

2.   The Secretary of  State  applied  for  leave  to  appeal  against  that
    determination and leave was  granted  by  another  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge.  The relevant part of the reasons is as follows:  "The  findings
    of the First-tier Tribunal  are  very  brief  and  are  not  adequately
    reasoned."  We say straightaway we agree with that analysis.  The First-
    tier Tribunal considered the case of the mother, the respondent to this
    appeal, under paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration Rules, in  particular
    subparagraph (vi).  She was, so it was asserted, a person over the  age
    of 18 who had lived continuously in the United Kingdom  for  less  than
    twenty years but had no ties (including  social,  cultural  or  family)
    with the country to which she would have to go if required to leave the
    United Kingdom.  The crucial issue in the case was whether she had  "no
    ties" as defined in paragraph 276.

3.   The finding of the First-tier Tribunal on that issue reads  as  follows
    at paragraph 21:

         "The appellant has resided continuously in the  UK  for  more  than
         eight years.  She was born and brought up in Nigeria.  Although she
         speaks the language there is no continuing  connection  by  way  of
         family.  I find that the distant cousins are not  in  contact  with
         the appellant and the nature of their relationship does not  amount
         to evidence of a continuing connection with Nigeria."

4.   Nowhere in the determination is  there  any  use  of  the  language  of
    subparagraph (vi) of paragraph 276ADE.  There is  no  analysis  of  the
    social and cultural background of the respondent to this appeal.  There
    is no indication in the reasoning within  the  determination  that  the
    First-tier Tribunal considered those issues at all.   With  respect  to
    the First-tier Tribunal, the Tribunal appears  to  equate  "ties"  with
    "friends and family in Nigeria with  whom  the  respondent  remains  in
    regular touch".  That  is  not  the  language  of  the  Rules  and  the
    reasoning was plainly inadequate.   It  is  argued  on  behalf  of  the
    respondent today that the determination was "very  well-reasoned".   We
    concluded that that was a highly optimistic submission and  we  do  not
    accept it.

5.   The other limb of the determination was the determination  in  relation
    to the child, by then aged 9ï¿½, of the respondent, a child who had  been
    born in Nigeria but entered the United  Kingdom  with  the  respondent.
    (There was an issue before  us  as  to  whether  such  entry  had  been
    unlawful ab initio or whether the respondent's presence became unlawful
    when she overstayed a visitor's visa.  It  is  not  necessary  for  our
    purposes to determine that issue.  It is the case that the  First  Tier
    Tribunal proceeded on the former  basis.)   The  consideration  of  the
    child identified the time he had spent in this country, the  fact  that
    he had attended school in this country and the fact that he would  have
    no memory of Nigeria, having left there when he was  1.   Those  issues
    were discussed in advance of any consideration of the position  of  his
    mother and  the  determination  simply  concluded  that  "it  would  be
    unreasonable to remove him to Nigeria  in  the  circumstances  of  this
    case".

6.   We consider that that was not adequate  reasoning,  particularly  since
    we have determined that the respondent mother potentially did not  fall
    within subparagraph (vi) of paragraph 276ADE.  In  those  circumstances
    any return would be as a family unit.

7.   For all of those reasons we  consider  that  the  determination  cannot
    stand and it must be set aside.  The Secretary of State  concedes  that
    the proper course is for this case to be  remitted  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal to be reheard by a different judge.  It may be that there will
    be other issues to be considered at the rehearing, not least  the  fact
    that a second child born to the respondent mother now has lived in this
    country for in excess of  seven  years.   However,  those  are  factual
    issues and will be a matter for the First-tier Tribunal to discuss  and
    consider on its reconsideration.

8.   Therefore we allow this appeal.
