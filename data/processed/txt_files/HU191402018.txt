For the Respondent:    Ms E Daykin, Counsel


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State  against  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Louise Wolfson ("the judge")  promulgated  on
    28 October 2019 allowing the appeal of Trevor [F]  ("Mr  [F]")  against
    the decision of the Secretary of State dated 5 September 2018 to deport
    him as a foreign criminal  who  had  been  sentenced  to  a  period  of
    imprisonment of at least 12 months.

 2. The immigration history of Mr [F], as narrated  by  the  judge,  is  as
    follows. Mr [F], a citizen of Jamaica, was born on  30  June  1971.  He
    entered the UK on 24 August 1997 on a six-month  visa  valid  until  24
    February 1998. He applied for leave to remain as a student on 19 August
    1998. His application was refused on 12 July 1999. He applied for leave
    to remain as the spouse of a settled person on 15  June  2005.  He  was
    convicted on 3 December 2007 at  Highbury  Magistrates'  Court  of  (a)
    driving while disqualified, resulting in a sentence of disqualification
    from driving for two years, endorsement of his driving  licence  and  a
    community  order  of  80  hours  unpaid  work;  and  (b)  resisting  or
    obstructing a constable in the execution of his duty,  resulting  in  a
    sentence of a consecutive community order of 40 hours unpaid  work.  On
    18 October 2010 the Secretary of State notified him  that  it  was  not
    proposed to take any deportation action against him at that time and he
    was given a warning. On 18 March  2011  he  was  granted  discretionary
    leave to remain until 17 March 2014. He applied for  further  leave  to
    remain on 15 March 2014. On 8 May 2014 he was granted leave  to  remain
    until 8 May 2017. He was convicted on 8  May  2014  at  Central  London
    Magistrates' Court of (a) common assault, resulting in  the  imposition
    of a community order for unpaid work and orders  for  �50  compensation
    and �85 costs,  and  (b)  assaulting  a  constable,  resulting  in  the
    imposition of a compensation order of �50. On 20  June  2016  at  North
    London Magistrates' Court he was convicted of assaulting  a  constable,
    resulting in the imposition of a community order for unpaid work  until
    19 June 2017, a compensation order of �50 and  a  victim  surcharge  of
    �60. On 1 June 2017 he applied for leave to remain outside  the  rules.
    On 2 and 4 August 2017 at Blackfriars Crown Court he was  convicted  of
    possessing cocaine and diamorphine with intent  to  supply  and  simple
    possession of diamorphine, sentenced to  four  years  imprisonment  and
    ordered to pay a victim surcharge of �80. He  did  not  appeal  against
    conviction  or  sentence.  On  18  July  2018  he  was  served  with  a
    deportation  order.  On  13  August  2018  his  legal   representatives
    responded to the effect that deportation would breach his human  rights
    under article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). On 5
    September 2018 the Secretary of State refused his human rights claim.

 3. In refusing Mr [F]'s human rights claim the Secretary of State  decided
    that his removal was conducive to the public  good  and  in  accordance
    with section 32(5) of the UK Borders  Act  2007  (the  2007  Act).  The
    Secretary of State noted that in order to  establish  that  deportation
    would breach his human rights under article  8  Mr  [F]  had  first  to
    establish the existence of a private or family life. Interference  with
    his private or family life would not breach his qualified rights  under
    article 8(1) if it could be justified  under  article  8(2).  Mr  [F]'s
    deportation was conducive to the public interest because  he  had  been
    convicted of an offence for which he had been sentenced to a period  of
    imprisonment of at least four years and the  public  interest  required
    his deportation under paragraph 398 of  the  Immigration  rules  unless
    there were very compelling circumstances over and above those described
    in the exceptions to deportation set out in paragraphs 399 and 399A  of
    the Immigration Rules. The Secretary of State considered that Mr  [F]'s
    history of criminality as evidenced by his  various  convictions  meant
    that he had demonstrated a blatant disregard for the laws of the United
    Kingdom. He had been granted leave to remain in several  occasions  but
    had shown a blatant disregard for the hospitality afforded to  him  and
    for immigration control. The secretary of State accepted  that  it  was
    proved that Mr [F] and his wife [N] had lived at the same address since
    2014 and had two children aged respectively 20 and 17 who  are  British
    citizens. It was considered that his wife and children could remain  in
    the UK when he was deported to Jamaica and maintain contact with him by
    visits and modern means of communication. The children had  been  cared
    for by their mother while Mr [F] was in custody.  As  British  citizens
    the children and their mother could access support in the UK and  would
    be able to lead a normal life if Mr [F] were deported. The Secretary of
    State considered that  Mr  [F]'s  ability  to  conduct  a  genuine  and
    subsisting  relationship  with  his  children  and  spouse   had   been
    compromised by his criminality and  the  substantial  sentence  he  had
    received  for  his  offence.  Alternatively,  the  Secretary  of  State
    considered that the whole family could relocate to Jamaica. There would
    be no undue hardship for the children due  to  a  language  barrier  as
    English is widely used in Jamaica, including  in  schools.  There  were
    educational facilities in Jamaica. They would also be able to return to
    the UK when they were able to live independently.  His  wife  would  be
    able to adjust and settle into the way of  life  in  Jamaica  with  his
    support.  No  evidence  of  insurmountable  obstacles  to  the   family
    relocating to Jamaica had been provided. It was not therefore  accepted
    that having a British citizen spouse  and  children  in  the  UK  would
    prevent deportation or amount to a breach of article 8 of the ECHR.  In
    relation to Mr [F]'s private life, it was accepted that he had lived in
    the UK since 24 August 1997  apart  from  brief  absences  for  travel,
    making 21 years of  stay.  He  had  been  in  various  employments  and
    established private life with friends and acquaintances. The  Secretary
    of State considered that any such relationships could be maintained  by
    the use of modern communications and visits. It was not  accepted  that
    there would be very  significant  obstacles  to  his  integration  into
    Jamaica because there was no language barrier and he had relations  and
    an initial social network there. There was no evidence to show that  he
    was now estranged from Jamaica to the extent that there would  be  very
    significant  obstacles  to  his  reintegration  there.  The  knowledge,
    skills, employment, and business experiences gained in the UK could  be
    used to re-establish his private life  in  Jamaica.  The  Secretary  of
    State considered that, due to  the  nature  of  the  offences  and  the
    sentence imposed, Mr [F]'s right to private life did not  outweigh  the
    public interest in his being deported.

 4. Having heard and considered evidence from the Mr [F] and his wife,  the
    judge made the following findings of fact (in which we  substitute  "Mr
    [F]" for "the appellant"):

      a. Mr [F] is a 48-year-old Jamaican man.

      b.  I  accept  the  summary  of  Mr  [F]'s  immigration  history   and
         convictions as set out under "Immigration History" above.

      c. He has been in a relationship with [N] (a British citizen) since at
         least 1999, when they started living together. They  married  on  4
         February 2004.

      d. Mr [F] has two children with [N] - [Tn] (now 20 years old) and [Ta]
         (now 17 years old). They are both British citizens.

      e. Mr [F] has had little education and left home at a young  age.  His
         father has died and he is estranged from his mother and brother. He
         has no other family in Jamaica.

      f. Mr [F] was the principal carer for the children prior to being sent
         to prison. He looked after the children whilst [N] was studying and
         working, enabling her to progress her career.

      g. [N] is an aesthetic therapist and currently works for a company  in
         Harley Street. She previously ran her own  business  called  [IDC].
         All her extended family are in the UK.

      h. [Tn] studied sports and exercise science at college. He  wanted  to
         continue this at university but dropped out of his course.

      i. [Ta] has just done her GCSEs and has had to retake her English exam
         in order to continue with A Levels. She is  doing  a  BTEC  in  the
         meantime. She would like to be a doctor or scientist.

      j. Whilst he was in prison Mr  [F]  undertook  various  rehabilitation
         courses and worked as a cleaner / peer mentor. Since  release  from
         prison he has reported to probation on a weekly basis and  has  not
         been in breach of his licence conditions.

 5. The judge proceeded to consider section 117C(4)  (5)  and  (6)  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act  2002  (the  2002  Act).  She
    declined to find that there were very significant obstacles to Mr [F]'s
    integration  into  Jamaican  society  and  therefore   concluded   that
    Exception 1 in section 117C(4) of the 2002 Act was not  satisfied.  She
    then went on  to  find  that  the  requirements  of  Exception  2  were
    satisfied because Mr [F]'s deportation would be  unduly  harsh  on  his
    wife and children and that there  were  very  compelling  circumstances
    over and above Exception 2 such that the decision to deport him  was  a
    disproportionate interference with his article 8 rights. She  therefore
    allowed the appeal.

 6. The Secretary of State has appealed against the judge's decision on the
    ground that Mr [F]'s four year prison  sentence  made  him  liable  for
    automatic deportation under section 32(5) of the 2007 Act and  that  to
    avoid deportation he had  to  show  that  there  were  very  compelling
    circumstances, over and above those in Exceptions 1 and  2  in  section
    117C of the 2002 Act, as repeated in Immigration Rule  398.  No  unduly
    harsh consequences nor  any  very  compelling  circumstances  had  been
    identified and the judge had made an  error  of  law  in  allowing  the
    appeal. Leave to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Landes
    on 28 November 2019. In amplification of  the  grounds  of  appeal  the
    secretary  of  State  submitted  that  the  judge  had  erred  by   not
    identifying sufficient reasons why the separation would be unduly harsh
    on Mr [F]'s wife  and/or  minor  child.  The  judge  had  made  various
    speculative points about  the  impact  of  separation  on  the  child's
    education on the basis that it was possible that the minor child  might
    give up her ambition to start tertiary education and that his wife  was
    not sure whether their relationship would continue at a  distance.  The
    stresses and strains of deportation  on  a  family  had  been  properly
    considered in Secretary of State for the Home Department v PG (Jamaica)
    [2019] EWCA Civ 1213. Lives being made more difficult in  several  ways
    without the presence of the deportee were the  likely  consequences  of
    deportation of any foreign criminal. It was  natural  that  the  family
    would wish Mr [F] to remain in the UK but their  preferences  were  not
    sufficient to outweigh the very  significant  public  interest  in  his
    deportation. It was also natural for the family to magnify the possible
    effects of Mr [F]'s absence on their lives even though  they  continued
    to function as a family unit when he was serving his  prison  sentence.
    In the context of criminal deportation and the approach taken in PG  no
    unduly harsh consequences or very  compelling  circumstances  had  been
    identified. The judge had made a material error in law by  allowing  Mr
    [F]'s appeal.

 7. It was submitted in response by counsel for Mr [F] that the  judge  had
    properly directed herself at all times to the correct legal  principles
    and that there was no suggestion otherwise. On the  face  of  them  the
    Secretary of State's grounds of appeal amounted to a reasons  challenge
    but on analysis were actually a perversity challenge since the  reasons
    for the findings of unduly harsh and very compelling circumstances were
    given, although the Secretary of state did not accept  that  these  met
    the threshold. The only matter specifically dealt with in  the  grounds
    of appeal was the conclusion that it would be unduly harsh for his wife
    and minor child  to  remain  in  the  UK  without  him:  no  error  was
    identified in the finding that it would be unduly harsh for the  family
    to relocate to Jamaica, only a restatement of the Secretary of  State's
    position. The reasons given by the judge at para 38 for finding that it
    would be unduly harsh for Mr [F]'s wife and minor child  to  remain  in
    the UK without him were as follows:

      1) His absence while in prison had placed a huge strain  on  his  wife
         and deportation would aggravate that.

      2) His absence had already had a negative  impact  on  his  daughter's
         educational attainment and future prospects.

      3) His deportation would impact his daughter's further  education.  He
         has been her primary carer and his return home  has  been  positive
         for her.

      4) It is in his daughter's best interests that he should remain in the
         UK.

      5) If he were to be deported his marriage was likely  to  break  down,
         causing the negative impact on his daughter to be more significant.



      6)  His  daughter  would  then  have  to  maintain   a   long-distance
         relationship with him when her relationship with  him  had  already
         been negatively affected by his period of imprisonment.

 8. The above reasons justified the finding that it would be  unduly  harsh
    for his daughter to remain in the UK without him. She was at a critical
    stage of her education and  development,  which  had  already  suffered
    because of his period of imprisonment. As  his  relationship  with  his
    wife was unlikely to withstand deportation that  necessarily  made  the
    position worse for his daughter. These matters were all properly  taken
    into account by the  judge.  Although  a  different  judge  might  have
    reached a different decision  the  grounds  of  appeal  amounted  to  a
    disagreement with the judge's decision. It could not be said  that  her
    decision was devoid of sufficient reasons or that it was  perverse  for
    the reasons given.

 9. It was further submitted on behalf of  Mr  [F]  that  so  far  as  very
    compelling circumstances were concerned it could not be said  that  the
    judge had not given reasons for her conclusion.  In  reality  what  the
    Secretary of State was submitting was that the conclusion was  perverse
    for the reasons given. The reasons given by the judge at para 41, which
    were explicitly stated as being "over and above" Exceptions  1  and  2,
    were as follows:

      a) Exception 2 was robustly met.

      b) Mr [F] showed remorse and regret.

      c) He had engaged in rehabilitation and adhered to the  terms  of  his
         licence.

      d) He had been an asset in the classroom and a  valued  and  respected
         mentor.

      e) He had had a troubled childhood and little education.

      f) He was estranged from his family in Jamaica and reliant  on  family
         and friends in the UK.

      g) He had dissociated himself from criminal peers.

      h) He had made a positive contribution to his family in the UK.

      i) His wife wished him to re-join the family unit.

      j) He had played an active role in the upbringing of his children  and
         wished to continue to do so.

      k) Prospects for the  children  achieving  their  potential  would  be
         significantly diminished if he were to be deported.

    The Secretary of State had failed to identify a material error  of  law
    in the judge's decision and the appeal should be dismissed.

10. In MK (section 55 - tribunal Options) Sierra Leone [2015] UKUT 223  the
    Tribunal stated as follows at paragraph 46:

         "'unduly harsh' does not equate with  uncomfortable,  inconvenient,
         undesirable or merely difficult. Rather, it  poses  a  considerably
         more elevated threshold. 'Harsh' in this context denotes  something
         severe or bleak. It is the antithesis of pleasant  or  comfortable.
         Furthermore, the addition of the adverb 'unduly' raises an  already
         elevated standard still higher."

11. In KO (Nigeria) v Secretary of  State  for  the  Home  Department  Lord
    Carnwath, giving the judgment of the Supreme Court, said  at  paragraph
    23:

         "... the  expression  'unduly  harsh'  seems  clearly  intended  to
         introduce a higher  hurdle  than  that  of  'reasonableness'  under
         section 117B(6), taking account  of  the  public  interest  in  the
         deportation  of  foreign  criminals.  Further,  the  word  'unduly'
         implies an element of comparison. It assumes there is a 'due' level
         of  harshness,  that  is,  a  level  which  may  be  acceptable  or
         justifiable in the relevant  context.  'Unduly'  implies  something
         going beyond that level.  The  relevant  context  is  that  set  by
         section 117C(1), that is, the public interest in the deportation of
         foreign criminals. One is looking for a degree of  harshness  going
         beyond what would necessarily be involved for any child faced  with
         the deportation of a parent. What it does not require  in  my  view
         (and subject to the discussion of the cases in the next section) is
         a balancing of the relative levels  of  severity  of  the  parent's
         offence, other than is inherent in the  distinction  drawn  by  the
         section itself by reference to length of sentence. Nor (contrary to
         the view of the Court of Appeal in  IT  (Jamaica)  v  Secretary  of
         State for the Home Department [2016] EWCA Civ  932,  [2017]  1  WLR
         240, paras 55, 64) can it be equated with  a  requirement  to  show
         'very compelling reasons'. That would be in effect to replicate the
         additional  test  applied  by  section  117C(6)  with  respect   to
         sentences of four years or more."

12. In Secretary of State for the Home Department  v  PG  (Jamaica)  [2019]
    EWCA Civ 1213 Holroyde LJ stated at paragraph [34]:

         "It is therefore now clear that a  tribunal  or  court  considering
         section 117C(5) of the 2002 Act must focus, not on the  comparative
         seriousness of the offence or offences  committed  by  the  foreign
         criminal who faces deportation, but rather on whether  the  effects
         of his deportation on a child or partner would go beyond the degree
         of harshness which would necessarily be involved for any  child  or
         partner of a foreign criminal faced with deportation."

    Hickinbottom LJ stated at paragraph 46:

         "When a parent is deported one can only have great sympathy for the
         entirely innocent children involved. Even in circumstances in which
         they can remain in the United Kingdom with their other parent, they
         will inevitably be distressed. However, in section 117C(5)  of  the
         2002 Act Parliament has made  clear  its  will  that,  for  foreign
         offenders who are sentenced to one to four years,  only  where  the
         consequences for the children are 'unduly harsh'  will  deportation
         be constrained. That is entirely consistent with article 8  of  the
         ECHR.  It  is  important  that  decision-makers  and,  where  their
         decisions  are  challenged,  tribunals  and  courts   honour   that
         expression of Parliamentary will."

13. We refer also to the decision of the Court of Appeal  in  Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department v KF (Nigeria) [2019] EWCA Civ 2051.  The
    Court of Appeal held the Tribunal had erred in holding that the  effect
    of a foreign criminal's deportation on his  partner  and  child  would,
    within the meaning of s117C(5) of the 2002 Act and paragraph 399 of the
    Immigration Rules, be unduly harsh, based on its conclusions  that  the
    risk of reoffending was low and the child  was  likely  to  find  being
    deprived of  his  father  traumatic.  Those  conclusions  impermissibly
    involved a balancing of the relative level of severity of  the  offence
    and did not identify a degree of  harshness  going  beyond  what  would
    necessarily be involved for the family  of  a  foreign  criminal  being
    deported.

14. In our judgment the judge made material errors in law when she  reached
    her conclusions on "unduly harsh" and "very compelling  circumstances".
    The facts of this case could not on any conceivable view support  those
    conclusions. There is nothing in the facts of this case which go beyond
    the degree of harshness which would necessarily  be  involved  for  the
    child or spouse of a foreign criminal faced with  deportation.  In  our
    view it does not matter whether the judge's errors  are  classified  as
    absence of reasons or perversity as on any view they not in  accordance
    with binding judicial decisions explanatory of the two phrases. We  are
    satisfied that the submissions on behalf of the Secretary of State  are
    well founded and must be sustained. We therefore set aside the  judge's
    decision. It was not suggested on behalf of Mr [F] that, if we were  to
    do so, it would not be  appropriate  for  us  to  remake  the  decision
    ourselves. In those circumstances,  and  in  light  of  our  conclusion
    above, we proceed to re-make the decision by dismissing the appeal.
