                            DECISION AND REASONS






BACKGROUND TO THE APPEAL

1.   The Appellant was born in Somalia in 1982. He  arrived  in  the  United
    Kingdom on 22 March 1995, at that age of 13, with entry clearance under
    the family reunion policy and was granted refugee status and indefinite
    leave to remain, as a dependent of his mother, on 23 April 1996. It had
    been accepted that she had been associated with the  Somalia  Salvation
    Democratic Front and was a member of the Majeerteen, a sub-clan of Issa
    Mohammed.
2.   Between  10  March  1998  and  28  February  2003,  the  Appellant  was
    convicted on five separate occasions. The fifth  conviction  at  Harrow
    Crown Court was for robbery and false imprisonment and he was sentenced
    to five years in prison.  Between 26 June 2006 and 26 June 2008, he was
    convicted on three further occasions. The last conviction at  Southwark
    Crown Court was for robbery and he  was  sentenced  to  four  years  in
    prison. This led to a deportation order being  made  against  him  on19
    July 2010. This order was revoked on 27 January 2011 on the basis  that
    he was a refugee.

3.   On 11 January 2013 he was convicted at Isleworth  Crown  Court  on  six
    counts of possession of a Class A drug, namely heroin, with  intent  to
    supply and five counts of possession of a Class A  drug,  namely  crack
    cocaine, with intent to supply. He was then sentenced to a total of two
    years  imprisonment.  He  was  served  with  notice  of  liability   to
    deportation on 26 February 2013. On 28 March  2014  he  was  fined  for
    possessing a Class A drug.

4.   On 11 October 2016 the  Appellant  was  informed  that  the  Respondent
    intended to cease his refugee status and a decision was made  to  cease
    his refugee status on 24 May 2017. This was on the basis that since  he
    was granted asylum the situation in Somalia had altered  significantly.
    The Respondent also found  that  the  Appellant  could  be  removed  to
    Puntland, as his mother had said that he was born there.

5.   On 26 September 2017 the Appellant was notified that section  32(5)  of
    the UK Borders Act 2017 required him to be deported. The Appellant  did
    not respond but representations had previously been made on his  behalf
    on 30 March 2017. A decision to deport him was served on the  Appellant
    on 28 September 2017 and on 18 January 2018  a  deportation  order  was
    made against him.

6.   On 14 May 2018 the Respondent refused the  Appellant's  protection  and
    human rights claims and the Appellant appealed on 29 October 2018. In a
    decision, promulgated on 14 January  2019,  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Baldwin dismissed his appeal.   The  Appellant  appealed  against  this
    decision and on 31  January  2019  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Simpson
    granted him permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.







ERROR OF LAW HEARING

7.    Counsel  for  the  Appellant  submitted  that  section  72(2)  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 had been  referred  to  in
    her skeleton argument but accepted that the Appellant had not sought to
    rebut the presumption contained in  this  section  in  his  grounds  of
    appeal. She also accepted that First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Baldwin  was
    obliged to consider whether the presumption had  been  rebutted  before
    moving on to consider whether the Appellant  was  entitled  to  refugee
    status. The Home Office Presenting  Officer  accepted  that  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Baldwin had failed to  consider  section  72(2)  in  his
    decision.  He also submitted that the Judge had failed  to  make  clear
    credibility finding in relation to his ability to return  to  Mogadishu
    in the context of MOJ & Ors (Return to Mogadishu) [2014]  UKUT  442.  I
    have referred to these and other submissions,  where  relevant,  in  my
    decision below.

ERROR OF LAW DECISION

8.   It was  not  disputed  that  the  Appellant  was  liable  to  automatic
    deportation under section 32(5) of the UK Borders Act 2017  as  he  had
    been convicted in the United Kingdom and sentenced at least  12  months
    imprisonment; namely two years imprisonment on 11 January 2013.

9.   The Respondent had also  certified  that  the  presumption  in  section
    72(2) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  This states
    that:

     "A person shall be presumed to have been convicted of a final  judgment
    of a particularly serious crime and  to  constitute  a  danger  to  the
    community of the United Kingdom if -

     (a) he is convicted in the United Kingdom of an offence and
     (b) sentenced to a period of imprisonment of at least two years".

10.  This was a rebuttable presumption,  but  in  his  decision  letter  the
    Respondent noted that the Appellant had failed to  reply  when  he  was
    given notice of the Respondent's decision to cease his  refugee  status
    and said that his refugee status remained ceased.

11.  I note that on 24 May 2017 the Respondent had  also  decided  to  cease
    the Appellant's refugee status "in view of the fact that Article 1C (5)
    of the Refugee Convention and subsequently  paragraph  399A(v)  of  the
    Immigration Rules now applies. The Applicant  had  a  right  to  appeal
    against the  decision  to  revoke  his  refugee  status  under  section
    82(1)(c) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002.However,
    the grounds of appeal,  dated  26  October  2018,  only  addressed  the
    decision to refuse the Appellant's protection and human  rights  claim.
    They did not address the underlying  decision  to  revoke  his  refugee
    status.

12.  Furthermore, as noted in the grant of permission,  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Baldwin did not remind himself of the  section  72  certification
    and went no further than stating at the start of paragraph  30  of  the
    decision: "the Appellant has been  convicted  of  particularly  serious
    crimes and remains in my judgment a danger to the community  here".  He
    did not give any clear reasons for reaching this decision.

13.  In addition, as First-tier Tribunal Judge Baldwin had  not  found  that
    the Appellant had rebutted the presumption in section 72,  he  did  not
    have the jurisdiction to consider whether there would be  a  breach  of
    the Refugee Convention. This amounted to a material error  of  law,  as
    accepted by both parties.

14.  The Appellant had relied on Dang (Refugee - query revocation -  Article
    3) [2013] UKUT 00043 in which the Upper Tribunal found that:

     "A decision to revoke or refuse  to  renew  a  grant  of  asylum  under
    paragraph  339A  of  the  Immigration  Rules  only   relates   to   the
    individual's status under the Qualification Directive (European refugee
    status) and not his status under the Refugee  Convention;  further,  it
    can only apply to cases in which the asylum application was made on  or
    after 21 October 2004 and at  least  one  of  the  provisions  in  sub-
    paragraphs (i)-(vi) of para 339A of the Immigration Rules applies".
15.  However, as noted above, the decision to revoke his refugee status  was
    not under challenge in the appeal. In any event, in paragraph 20 of the
    decision  to  cease  the  Appellant'  refugee  status  the   Respondent
    addressed both basis upon which his status could be ceased and stated:

     "In the light of the above, it has been decided to cease  your  refugee
    status in view of the  fact  that  Article  1C  (5)  of  the  1951  and
    subsequently paragraph 339A(v) of the Immigration Rules now applies".

16.  As a consequence, I find that there were errors of  law  in  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Baldwin's decision.

17.  Given the fundamental flaws in the Judge's  approach  and  the  limited
    appeal grounds relied upon, both parties were  of  the  view  that  the
    appeal should be remitted to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  I  am  in
    agreement with this view.

DECISION

(1)  The Appellant's appeal is allowed.

(2)  The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be heard  de  novo
    by a First-tier Tribunal Judge other than  First-tier  Tribunal  Judges
    Baldwin, Hodgkinson, Kainth and Simpson.
