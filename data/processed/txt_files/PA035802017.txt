Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr S Kotas, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   In this decision my task is to re-make the decision on the appeal made
by the appellant, who claims to be a national of Iran. In a decision posted
on 28 February 2018, Judge Obhi of the First-tier Tribunal (FtT) dismissed
his appeal against the decision made by the respondent on 17 March 2017 to
make a deportation order and to refuse his protection claim.  In a decision
sent on 2 July 2018, I set aside the decision of the FtT judge for material
error of law. Despite rejecting five other grounds of appeal I was
persuaded by a sixth ground that the judge had erred in not addressing a
report produced by the appellant from Professor Joffe. I stated that I
consider this failure material because the Joffe report was essentially a
critique of the country guidance case of SSH and HR Iran CG [2016] UKUT
00308 (IAC) in respect of the issue of risk to Kurds and needed to be
considered.

2.   However, I went on to conclude at para 13 that:

"In light of my foregoing analysis of the appellant's case, I consider that
the judge's findings of fact on the appellant's particular circumstances
can be preserved. The judge's only error related to whether the appellant
was entitled to succeed on the basis that he is Kurdish and someone who
exited illegally. The former characteristic is not in dispute but the
judge's decision contains no finding as to whether the appellant exited
illegally. For that reason I do not consider I am in a position to re-make
the decision without first affording the parties the opportunity to make
written submissions confined to the issue of whether the appellant should
be accepted as someone who left Iran illegally and whether, if he is
accepted to have exited illegally, that would suffice to put him, a person
of Kurdish ethnicity, at risk on return. I direct that such submissions be
sent to the Upper Tribunal (FAO Judge Storey) within 14 days of this
decision being sent to the parties."

3.   Subsequently I had to re-issue further directions following a CMR on 7
December 2018, as the respondent had not yet replied to my directions, in
part because it had been hoped that the Upper Tribunal would have issued
its decision in the anticipated country guidance case of HB (see below).

4.   On 28 January 2019 the respondent responded in the following terms.

"Firstly, in view of the adverse credibility findings made by Judge Obi who
saw no reason to depart from the negative credibility findings made against
the appellant by the tribunal in 2008, the Upper Tribunal should not,
therefore, accept the appellant as someone who left illegally. In essence,
the burden of proof still remains on him to substantiate that part of his
claim, and his general lack of credibility must still extend to the manner
of his departure.

However, in view of the newly reported country guidance case of HB(Kurds)
Iran (legal exist: failed asylum seekers) CG [2018] UKUT 430, the Upper
Tribunal is nevertheless invited to consider the appellant's case on the
alternative hypothetical case that he did exist illegally.

The only residual point left to determine was whether the appellant being
Kurdish and having existed illegally, would put him at risk. HB disposes of
the appellant's claim in this regard. Paragraph 4 of the headnote provides:

         "(4) However, the mere fact of being a returned of Kurdish
         ethnicity with or without a valid passport, and even if combined
         with illegal exist, does not create a risk of persecution or
         Article 3 ill-treatment".

In light of the above, the SSHD invites the Upper Tribunal to remake the
decision of the FtT dismissing the appellant's appeal. "

5.   I heard submissions from both representatives. Mr Dakora submitted
that even in the light of HB the fact of being a Kurd continues to be an
important factor requiring individual scrutiny. The appellant had been
involved in the UK in pro-Kurdish activity and he could not be expected to
tell lies on return. Mr Kotas submitted that the guidance in HB directly
applied against the appellant as he had been found to be a failed asylum
seeker. The appellant could not now turn round and ask for the individual
circumstances of his case to be decided afresh as the adverse findings of
Judge Obhi had been preserved and in addition the appellant's
representatives had not sought to re-open them before the hearing. Mr
Dakora responded that he was not seeking to re-open the case, only to
emphasise that sur place activity was always a factor that had to be
considered and Kurds continued to be scrutinised much more than in the
past.

My assessment

6.   As noted above, the findings of fact  made  by  Judge  Obhi  have  been
preserved. This means that the appellant's account of his  past  experiences
in Iran has  been  found  to  lack  credibility.  It  also  means  that  the
appellant has failed to establish that he left Iran illegally. On the  issue
of whether he should be taken to have  left  illegally,  I  concur  with  Mr
Kotas  that  the  burden  of  proof  still  remains  on  the  appellant   to
substantiate that part of his claim, and his  general  lack  of  credibility
must extend to the manner of his departure. In my judgement,  the  appellant
has not discharged that burden. The  approach  I  take  in  this  regard  is
consistent with that taken by the Supreme Court in MA (Somalia) v  Secretary
of State for the Home Department [2010] UKSC 49 (24 November 2010

7.   Mr Dakora submits that even basing myself on the findings of fact made
by Judge Obhi, I should allow the appellant's appeal. He said that this was
for two reasons: first, the appellant was Kurdish; and second, because he
had been found to have a level of sur place activity.

8.   I deal first with the accepted fact of the appellant's Kurdish
ethnicity. It follows from the terms of my directions when dealing with the
error of law decision, that I must also consider the appellant's case by
reference to the report that was submitted by Professor Joffe, insofar as
the latter took issue with the Tribunal country guidance  in SSH and HR
(illegal exit: failed asylum seeker) Iran (CG) [2016] UKUT 308 (IAC).

9.   I consider that the new country guidance case of HB fully considered
Professor Joffe's expert evidence to this effect. I see no reason to depart
from the conclusions it went on to reach on Professor Joffe's position
(insofar as it had been stated in his past reports such as the one produced
for this appeal and was still stated in part in the proceedings in HB),
namely that Kurdish ethnicity sufficed to put returnees at real risk of
persecution. The Tribunal's conclusion was:

    "59. The appellant's skeleton argument states at  [99]  that  Professor
         Joff� accepts that Kurdish ethnicity does  not  create  a  risk  of
         persecution per se. However, we do not think that that accurately
         captures his view in the light of what he  says  at  [124]  of  his
         report which we refer to above,  and  in  the  light  of  his  oral
         evidence to which we have also referred.

    60.  If Professor Joff� does take that view, we are not satisfied  that
         the evidence supports a contention  that  Kurdish  ethnicity  alone
         creates a risk of persecution or Article 3 ill-treatment on return.
         That is not a view supported by  the  background  evidence,  it  is
         inconsistent with Ms Enayat's evidence and indeed we are not  asked
         on behalf of the appellant so to conclude.

    61.  We note Professor Joff�'s evidence in his report at [113] that  he
         is substantially in agreement  with  the  conclusions  in SSH  and
         HR "if it were not for two  further  considerations".  He  wonders
         whether the Tribunal in that case overlooked two general aspects of
         the "current situation" in Iran: the worsening  security  situation
         in parts of the country occupied predominantly by one of  the  many
         ethnic or religious minorities and the increased domestic tensions.
         He states that in his view the Tribunal  "has  under-estimated  the
         potential difficulties connected with the acquisition  of  laissez-
         passer documentation."

    62.  His report then expands on those issues, concluding that there  is
         intensified repression of Kurds and that if a Kurdish returnee  has
         given rise to suspicions of anti-regime behaviour, either abroad or
         in Iran before they left, "his prospects  of  avoiding  persecution
         upon return will have been significantly diminished". He goes on to
         state that he does not feel that the decision in SSH  and  HR has
         paid sufficient attention to those considerations which  would  now
         be intensified by Iranian  Kurdish  reaction  to  the  independence
         referendum  in  Iraqi  Kurdistan.  He  also  suggests  that   those
         considerations have been neglected in the latest edition of the COI
         [CIG].

    63.  Those views led to Professor Joff�'s conclusions which we have set
         out at our [52]-[54] above and which we have rejected.

    64.  However, we have returned to Professor Joff�'s evidence on this in
         order to explain why, in so far as Professor Joff� suggests it,  we
         reject the contention that SSH and HR is wrong in  terms  of  its
         country guidance. In the first  place,  we  do  not  consider  that
         Professor Joff�'s reasons provide a  sufficient  basis  for  us  to
         reconsider the guidance in SSH and HR.  Secondly,  that  is  not  a
         position argued for on behalf of the  appellant  and  was  not  the
         basis upon which the appeal  before  us  was  presented  by  either
         party.

    65.  Thus, in the appellant's written submissions at [8] it states that
         the appellant  does  not  seek  to  disturb  the  country  guidance
         findings in SSH and HR and at [11] that it is the country guidance
         case   for   assessing   asylum   claims   that   rely   upon   the
         unparticularised fact of having claimed asylum abroad. In addition,
         we have already referred to the appellant's suggestion that SSH and
         HR is the starting point for  the  assessment  of  the  appellant's
         claim, a suggestion which we have rejected for the  reasons  given.
         Lastly, at [12] of the written submissions it is  expressly  stated
         that the appellant is not seeking to go behind the country guidance
         in SSH and HR.

    66.  We are firm in concluding that the country guidance given  in  SSH
         and HR remains valid."

10.  I turn then to Mr Dakora's only other ground, namely that the
appellant would be at risk by virtue of his accepted sur place activities
in the UK.

11.  It follows from the terms of my error of law decision that the
appellant's sur place activities must be assessed on the basis of the
judge's findings of fact regarding them at para 42 that:

"In relation to the sur place activities, he started appearing in
demonstrations and having photographs taken in order to enhance his claim,
he is not a political activity as he portrays himself, he has little
knowledge, interest or commitment to any political cause, his involvement
in these demonstrations is for no genuine political motive. The Iranian
authorities will see that the appellant has done this for his own personal
reasons and that in reality he is of no interest to them'"

12.  In addressing a submission made by Mr Dakora at the error of law
hearing (contending that the judge failed this in paragraph to consider
whether the appellant's sur place activities would put him at risk,
irrespective of whether they were contrived), I stated at para 10 of my
decision:

         "10. Ground (5) focuses on the judge's treatment of the appellant's
         sur place activities at paragraph 42.  It is true that in paragraph
         42 the judge does count against the appellant's claim that in his
         assessment the appellant undertook these activities to enhance his
         claim.  But that in itself is not an error.  Article 4(3)(d) of the
         Qualification Directive requires that decision-makers take into
         account "whether the applicant's activities since leaving the
         country of origin were engaged in for the sole or main purpose of
         creating the necessary conditions for applying for international
         protection ...".  The judge would only have fallen into error if
         she had not gone on to consider whether (to complete the wording of
         Article 4(3)(d)) "these activities will expose the applicant to
         persecution or serious harm if returned to that country").  But the
         judge did go on.  The final sentence is the judge's answer to this
         question: such activities will not expose the appellant to risk
         because "[t]he Iranian authorities will see that the appellant has
         done this for his own personal reasons and that in reality he is of
         no interest to them".  The grounds assert that such a finding was
         contrary to the Tribunal's decision in AB and Others (internet
         activity - state of evidence) Iran [2015] UKUT 257 (IAC), which
         found at paragraph 464 that it is not relevant if a person has used
         the internet in an opportunistic way.  However, AB and Others is
         not a country guidance case and the head note acknowledges that the
         panel had insufficient evidence before it to issue such guidance.
         The judge's finding in the last sentence was consistent with
         background COI highlighting the sophisticated nature of Iranian
         intelligence and the evident fact that only a relatively small
         percentage of bloggers are targeted on return."

13.  I consider that Mr Dakora is right to submit that the judge's
acceptance of some level of sur place activity on the part of the appellant
is something that I must consider when re-making my decision; they
differentiate him from a mere failed asylum seeker of Kurdish ethnicity.
However, I am not able to accept that such activities would put the
appellant at risk. The background country evidence before me in this case
continues to highlight the sophisticated nature of Iranian intelligence.
The Upper Tribunal in HB at para 82 made very clear that their guidance did
not address the issue of sur place activities. Further, their
identification of risk factors arising for those of Kurdish ethnicity all
concerned persons whose political activity was genuine. They do not address
at all whether the Iranian authorities would take an adverse view of sur
place activities on the part of a person who they would be ab le to see was
clearly seeking to manufacture a political profile that was not genuine.

14.  Mr Dakora did not seek to adduce any further evidence to indicate that
the Iranian authorities would take an adverse view of returning Kurds who
had manufactured sur place activities.

15.  For the above reasons the decision I re-make is to dismiss the
appellant's appeal.

To summarise:

The decision of the FtT judge has already been set aside for material error
of law.

The decision I re-make is to dismiss the appellant's appeal.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
