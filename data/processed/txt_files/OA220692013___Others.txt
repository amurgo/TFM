                            DECISION AND REASONS



Introduction and Background

 1. The Appellants appeal against a decision of  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Parkes promulgated on 3rd July 2014.

 2. The Appellants are  Nepalese  citizens  born  31st  August  1976,  22nd
    February 1997, 10th February 2001, and 15th July 1998 respectively.

 3. The first Appellant is the mother  of  the  second,  third  and  fourth
    Appellants.   The  Appellants  applied  in  November  2013  for   entry
    clearance as the partner and dependent children of a  Tier  2  Migrant,
    Tej Bahadur Bhandari to whom I shall refer as the Sponsor, and  who  is
    the husband of the first Appellant, and the  father  of  the  remaining
    Appellants.

 4. The  applications  were  refused  on  2nd  December  2013.   The  first
    Appellant's application was refused with reference to paragraph 319C(d)
    the Respondent not accepting that  her  marriage  to  the  Sponsor  was
    subsisting, and (e)  the  Respondent  not  accepting  that  the  couple
    intended to live with  each  other  as  spouses  throughout  the  first
    Appellant's stay in the United Kingdom.

 5. In giving reasons for refusal the Respondent noted the Sponsor  held  a
    residence permit as a Tier 2 Migrant and that he had been living in the
    United Kingdom since April 2009.  Prior to that he had been employed in
    Doha.  The first Appellant had submitted a marriage  certificate  dated
    8th January 2008, which confirmed that she married the Sponsor on  18th
    January 1995.  The Respondent accepted this document as evidence that a
    marriage had been registered, but did not accept that it  was  evidence
    that the relationship is subsisting, or that  the  couple  intended  to
    live together as spouses.  The  Respondent  noted  that  apart  from  a
    recent photograph featuring the Sponsor and the Appellants, no evidence
    of a relationship had been submitted.   The  Respondent  considered  it
    reasonable to expect that a relationship that had  existed  since  1995
    would accumulate evidence of intervening devotion, such as e-mails  and
    letters and evidence of telephone calls made.   The  lack  of  evidence
    caused the Respondent to refuse the application.   The  Respondent  did
    not accept that refusal of entry clearance breached Article  8  of  the
    1950 European Convention on Human Rights (the 1950 Convention).

 6. The applications of  the  second,  third  and  fourth  Appellants  were
    refused with reference to  paragraph  319H(f)  because  their  mother's
    application had been refused.

 7. The Appellants appealed contending in summary that the  Respondent  had
    failed to  consider  evidence  of  a  relationship  between  the  first
    Appellant and Sponsor, in that telephone records  had  been  submitted,
    and a money  transfer  statement,  showing  money  sent  to  the  first
    Appellant by the Sponsor between 25th January  2011  and  29th  October
    2013.

 8. It was contended that telephone records showed itemised calls,  and  it
    was  also  contended  that  the  Sponsor's  passport,  which  had  been
    produced, showed many visits made to Nepal by the Sponsor to visit  his
    wife and children.

 9. It was submitted that satisfactory evidence had been produced  to  show
    regular contact  between  the  first  Appellant  and  Sponsor,  and  in
    addition to the itemised call records, the Sponsor had  initially  used
    telephone cards because these were economical.

10. The appeal was heard by the First-tier  Tribunal  (FTT)  on  20th  June
    2014.  The FTT was not satisfied that the  evidence  demonstrated  that
    the Appellants had discharged the burden of proof.  The FTT  considered
    in addition, issues of maintenance and accommodation, and  the  appeals
    were dismissed on these grounds, in addition to the grounds  raised  in
    the decision to refuse entry clearance.

11. The Appellants were granted permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal,
    and the appeal was heard by Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Pickup on  19th
    December 2014.  Judge Pickup found that the FTT had  erred  in  law  by
    making findings on accommodation and maintenance issues  that  had  not
    been raised by the Respondent in refusing entry clearance, and  without
    allowing the Appellants' representative to  make  submissions  on  this
    issue, and if necessary call evidence.

12. Judge Pickup found the FTT had made flawed findings and conclusions  in
    relation to maintenance and accommodation, and that these findings  had
    infected the finding made  in  relation  to  the  relationship.   Judge
    Pickup therefore set aside the decision of the  FTT  in  its  entirety,
    with no findings preserved.

13. Full details of the application for permission to appeal, the grant  of
    permission, and the reasons given for  finding  an  error  of  law  are
    contained in Judge Pickup's decision dated  31st  December  2014.   The
    appeals were subsequently allocated to me on 3rd July 2015.

Re-making the Decisions

Preliminary Issues

14. I ascertained that I had  all  documentation  upon  which  the  parties
    intended to rely, and that each party had served  the  other  with  any
    documentation upon  which  reliance  was  to  be  placed.   I  had  the
    Respondent's bundle of documents that had been  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, and  a  bundle  of  documents  submitted  on  behalf  of  the
    Appellants comprising 52 pages.

15. Mr Smart clarified that the issues to be decided were those  raised  in
    the decision to refuse, which related to the relationship  between  the
    first Appellant and  Sponsor.   It  was  not  contended  that  adequate
    maintenance and accommodation would not be available.

16. Mr Hussein advised that the Sponsor  would  be  giving  oral  evidence.
    Both representatives indicated that they  were  ready  to  proceed  and
    there was no application for an adjournment.

Oral Evidence

17. The Sponsor gave his evidence with the assistance of an interpreter  in
    Nepali.  There  were  no  difficulties  in  communication  between  the
    Sponsor and interpreter.

18. The Sponsor adopted as his evidence his witness  statement  dated  23rd
    June 2015 which may be summarised as follows.

19. The Sponsor came to the United Kingdom in 2009 to work as a  chef.   He
    has always had valid leave to remain.  The Appellants are his wife  and
    three of his children and they applied for entry clearance to join  him
    in the United Kingdom as his dependants.

20. The Sponsor contends that  the  Respondent  was  wrong  to  refuse  the
    applications on the basis that his relationship with his  wife  is  not
    subsisting and that they do not intend to live together.

21. The Sponsor has four children with his wife, his  eldest  daughter  was
    born in 1997, and his youngest son in 2008.  The Sponsor and  his  wife
    married in 1995.

22. The Sponsor accepted that in the Visa Application Form it was indicated
    that he and his wife had three children and  not  four.   He  explained
    this as an  error  in  translation,  his  wife  had  misunderstood  the
    question, thinking that  she  was  being  asked  about  the  number  of
    children who would be travelling with her.

23. The Sponsor believed that he had submitted sufficient evidence to prove
    the relationship between himself and his  wife.   His  passport  copies
    showed visits to Nepal, since he had arrived in the United Kingdom,  in
    2010, 2012 and 2014.

24. The Sponsor had also provided  evidence  of  telephone  records,  which
    proved that he telephoned his wife and children regularly.  He had also
    used telephone calling cards.

25. The Sponsor had provided evidence of money being sent by himself to his
    family in Nepal.  His wife is dependent upon him financially.

26. The Sponsor was questioned by both representatives and I have  recorded
    all questions and answers in my Record of Proceedings  and  it  is  not
    necessary to reiterate them in full here.  In brief summary when  asked
    why there had been an indication in the Visa Application Form  that  he
    and his wife had three children and not four,  the  Sponsor  said  that
    this was his mistake rather than his wife's mistake.  He had  completed
    the application form in the United Kingdom and sent it to his wife.  He
    believed that the question  was  asking  how  many  children  would  be
    travelling, and the answer to that question was  three.   The  youngest
    child would be staying with his grandparents in Nepal.  In relation  to
    photographs, the Sponsor said that he now had more photographs than the
    two originally submitted, and there were  various  photographs  of  his
    family, which were contained within his mobile telephone.

The Respondent's Submissions

27. Mr Smart submitted that the appeals should  be  dismissed  and  that  I
    should find the Sponsor is not a credible witness.

28. Mr Smart pointed out that the Sponsor had changed his  evidence  as  to
    who was responsible for stating that there were three  children  rather
    than four and contended that the  Sponsor  had  tried  to  mislead  the
    Respondent and the Tribunal on this issue and  that  he  had  committed
    deception.

29. I was asked to note that the photograph produced by the Sponsor  showed
    himself and his wife with only three children.

30. Although the Sponsor had said that he now had more photographs  of  his
    family, he had not produced them.  Mr Smart  submitted  that  this  was
    because he did not want to reveal that he had four children.

31. The Sponsor had said that he sent between �300 and �400  per  month  to
    his family in Nepal but the remittance records showed a significant gap
    between 13th December 2012 when he sent �40 and 31st July 2013 when  he
    sent �250.

32. In relation to telephone contact  the  Sponsor  had  accepted  in  oral
    evidence that he also spoke to his mother and father in Nepal,  on  the
    same number used to contact  his  wife,  and  therefore  the  telephone
    records which showed calls to a number ending 783, did not  prove  that
    all those calls were to the Sponsor's wife.

33. Mr Smart submitted that the evidence of the Sponsor could not be relied
    upon, and therefore the appeals should be dismissed.

The Appellants' Submissions

34. Mr Hussain submitted that there was ample evidence to  prove  that  the
    relationship between the Sponsor and his wife, the first Appellant, was
    subsisting and that they intended to live together as spouses.

35. I was asked to take into account the evidence of money  being  sent  to
    the Sponsor's family in Nepal.  In relation to the  Sponsor's  evidence
    Mr Hussain submitted that the Sponsor had confirmed that  he  had  only
    received a very basic education in Nepal, and  that  he  had  had  some
    difficulty in understanding some of the questions.

36. I was asked to find that the Sponsor  had  not  attempted  to  practise
    deception, and it was the  Sponsor  who  had  provided  information  to
    confirm that he had four children in total.  I was asked to accept  his
    explanation that the question in the Visa  Application  Form  had  been
    misunderstood, and that the Sponsor believed that he  was  being  asked
    how many children intended to travel to the  United  Kingdom  with  his
    wife.  Mr Hussein submitted that the Sponsor had  nothing  to  gain  by
    deliberately giving a wrong answer.

37. I was asked to note the number of visits that the Sponsor had made back
    to his family in Nepal since he arrived in the United Kingdom,  and  to
    accept the telephone records  together  with  the  Sponsor's  evidence,
    which  confirmed  regular  telephone  contact  with  his  family.   The
    telephone number in the itemised telephone call records  was  the  same
    number that had  been  given  for  the  first  Appellant  in  the  Visa
    Application Form.

38. Mr Hussain pointed out that identity cards and birth  certificates  had
    been produced and overall, the  combination  of  oral  and  documentary
    evidence discharged the burden of  proof  and  the  appeals  should  be
    allowed.

39. At the conclusion of oral submissions I reserved my decision.

My Conclusions and Reasons

40. The burden of proof in relation to paragraphs 319C and 319H is  on  the
    Appellants, and the standard of proof is a balance of probability.

41. I have considered the evidence in the round and with care, taking  into
    account that because  this  is  an  appeal  against  refusal  of  entry
    clearance, I must consider the circumstances appertaining at  the  date
    of refusal, that being 2nd December 2013.

42. The core issue relates to the  relationship  between  the  Sponsor  and
    first Appellant, as the entry clearance application was refused because
    the Respondent did not accept that the marriage is subsisting and  that
    the couple intended to live with each other as spouses  in  the  United
    Kingdom.  The applications of the second, third and  fourth  Appellants
    were refused because their mother's application was refused.

43. I am aware that the Sponsor has now been granted  indefinite  leave  to
    remain,  but  the  issue  that  I  have  to  decide,  relates  to   the
    applications that were made for entry clearance as dependants of a Tier
    2 Migrant.

44. Mr Hussain relied upon GA (subsisting marriage) Ghana  *  [2006]  UKAIT
    00046, the head note of which I set out below;

         "The requirement in para 281 that a marriage be "subsisting" is not
         limited to considering whether there  has  been  a  valid  marriage
         which formally continues.  The word requires an assessment  of  the
         current relationship between the  parties  and  a  decision  as  to
         whether in the broadest sense  it  comprises  a  marriage  properly
         described as "subsisting"."

45. Although GA related to an  application  to  enter  the  United  Kingdom
    pursuant to paragraph 281 of the Immigration Rules,  I  find  that  the
    principles do apply in these appeals,  where  the  application  is  for
    entry clearance for a limited period as dependants of a Tier 2 Migrant.

46. I have also taken into account the  principles  in  Goudey  (subsisting
    marriage - evidence) Sudan [2012] UKUT 00041 (IAC)  the  head  note  of
    which I set out below;

         i)   GA ("subsisting" marriage) Ghana * [2006]  UKAIT  00046  means
             that  the  matrimonial  relationship  must  continue  at   the
             relevant time rather than just the formality  of  a  marriage,
             but it does not require the production of particular  evidence
             of  mutual devotion before entry clearance can be granted.

         ii)  Evidence of telephone cards is capable of being  corroborative
             of the contention of the  parties  that  they  communicate  by
             telephone, even if such data  cannot  confirm  the  particular
             number the sponsor was calling in the country in question.  It
             is not a requirement that the parties also write or text  each
             other.

         iii) Where there are no countervailing factors generating suspicion
             as to the intentions of the  parties,  such  evidence  may  be
             sufficient to discharge the burden of proof on the claimant.

47. I also find it relevant to take into account the principles set out  in
    Naz (subsisting marriage - standard  of  proof)  Pakistan  [2012]  UKUT
    00040 (IAC) the head note of which I set out below;

         i)   It is for a claimant to establish that the requirements of the
             Immigration Rules are met  or  that  an  immigration  decision
             would be an interference with  established  family  life.   In
             both cases, the relevant standard for establishing  the  facts
             is the balance of probabilities.

         ii)  Post decision visits by a sponsor to his spouse are admissible
             in  evidence  in  appeals  to  show  that  the   marriage   is
             subsisting: DR (ECO: post-decision evidence) Morocco *  [2005]
             UKIAT 00038 applied.

48. The Respondent does not dispute that the Sponsor  and  first  Appellant
    married on 18th January 1995.  Their marriage certificate was  produced
    with the application for entry clearance.  It is common ground that the
    couple have four  children,  three  of  whom  have  applied  for  entry
    clearance together with their  mother,  the  first  Appellant.   It  is
    intended that the youngest child, born in 2008, will  remain  in  Nepal
    with grandparents.

49. I find that the Sponsor arrived in the United Kingdom in 2009,  with  a
    visa permitting him to take employment, which  was  valid  between  1st
    April 2009 and 1st April 2012.

50. I am satisfied that the Sponsor has returned to Nepal on three separate
    occasions since his arrival in the United Kingdom.  I base this finding
    upon the entries in the Sponsor's  passport,  together  with  his  oral
    evidence.  I also take into account that copies of some of  the  flight
    tickets  have  been  provided.   I  am  satisfied  on  a   balance   of
    probabilities that despite  the  lack  of  photographic  evidence,  the
    purpose of the Sponsor's visits was to spend time  with  his  wife  and
    children.

51. Having reflected upon the evidence, I do not find that the  Sponsor  or
    the Appellants attempted to deceive the Respondent by indicating  in  a
    Visa Application Form, that there were three  children  of  the  family
    rather than four.  The photograph produced showing the  Sponsor,  first
    Appellant, and three children, was, I accept, taken in 2007,  prior  to
    the birth of the youngest child.  I am  satisfied  that  the  erroneous
    response in the Visa Application Form, to the question asking how  many
    children the first Appellant has, was caused by a mistake  rather  than
    an attempt to deliberately deceive.  I  accept  that  the  Sponsor  and
    Appellant  indicated  that  there  are  three  children,  because  they
    intended that three of their children would apply for  entry  clearance
    and travel to the United Kingdom.  I note that it was the  Sponsor  who
    subsequently provided the information that he and his  wife  have  four
    children.

52. Telephone records have  been  produced  showing  frequent  and  regular
    telephone calls between the Sponsor, and a telephone number ending 783.
     I accept the Sponsor's evidence that  this  is  his  wife's  telephone
    number.  It is the same number as disclosed  in  the  Visa  Application
    Form.

53. The Sponsor disclosed in oral  evidence  that  he  also  spoke  to  his
    parents using that number.  I find that this enhances his  credibility.
    He need not have volunteered that information, which gave Mr Smart  the
    opportunity to suggest that the telephone calls  made  to  that  number
    were not always made to his wife.  I accept the Sponsor's evidence that
    the calls were not always to his wife, but on the majority of occasions
    telephone contact was between himself and his wife, rather than himself
    and his parents.  I accept, on  a  balance  of  probability,  that  the
    telephone records, and some copy telephone  cards,  prove  regular  and
    frequent contact between the Sponsor and his wife and children.

54. I also accept that the Sponsor has been sending money to the Appellants
    in Nepal.  Evidence of funds sent is contained in  statements  prepared
    by Bhandari Brothers Limited Money Service Business contained at  pages
    34 - 36 of the Appellants' bundle.

55. There is a discrepancy in that one statement is said  to  show  entries
    between 1st January 2013  and  31st  August  2013,  but  in  fact  this
    statement discloses money transfers sent  from  the  Sponsor  to  Nepal
    between 25th January 2011 and 31st  July  2013.   There  appear  to  be
    fifteen occasions between 25th January 2011 and 29th October 2013  when
    the Sponsor sent money to Nepal.  On each occasion the money  has  been
    sent to his wife, the first Appellant, but on two occasions  money  was
    sent to other relatives.

56. While it is true that there was a substantial gap between 13th December
    2012 and 31st July 2013 when no money was sent, I note that �5,000  was
    in fact sent on 11th December 2012.

57. I am  satisfied  that  the  Sponsor  has  been  sending  money  to  the
    Appellants on a regular basis.  I base this finding on a combination of
    the Sponsor's  oral  evidence  which  I  accept,  and  the  documentary
    evidence.

58. In conclusion I take into account that the Sponsor has  travelled  back
    to see the Appellants on three separate occasions since his arrival  in
    the United Kingdom.  There has been regular telephone  contact  between
    them, and he  has  regularly  sent  funds  to  them.   I  am  therefore
    satisfied, that the  Sponsor  and  first  Appellant  had  a  subsisting
    relationship at the time the application for entry clearance was  made,
    and that they intend to live together as spouses while  in  the  United
    Kingdom.

59. I conclude that the requirements  of  paragraph  319C(d)  and  (e)  are
    satisfied and therefore the first Appellant's appeal is allowed.

60. Because of that, I find that the requirements of paragraph 319H(f)  are
    satisfied, and the appeals of the second, third and  fourth  Appellants
    are allowed.

61. This is not a case where an appeal was pursued under Article 8  of  the
    1950 Convention, and therefore I do not go on to consider Article 8.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained an error of  law  and  was
set aside.  I substitute a fresh decision.

The appeals are allowed under the Immigration Rules.

Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal made no anonymity  direction.   There  has  been  no
request to the Upper Tribunal for anonymity.  No anonymity order is made.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

The appeals have been allowed but I do not consider it appropriate  to  make
a fee award.  I have placed weight upon the Sponsor's evidence that was  not
before the original decision maker.  Therefore no fee awards are made.
