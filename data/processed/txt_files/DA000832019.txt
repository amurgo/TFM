For the Respondent:    Mr V Ogunbusola, Counsel, instructed by Montas
Solicitors



                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against the decision dated 27 June 2019 of First-tier
    Tribunal Judge I  Howard  which  allowed  Mr  [D]'s  appeal  against  a
    decision  to  deport  him  made  under  Regulation  23(6)(b)   of   the
    Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations  2016   (the   EEA
    Regulations).

 2. For the purposes of this decision we refer to Mr [D] as  the  appellant
    and  to  the  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department  as  the
    respondent, reflecting their positions before the First-tier  Tribunal.



 3. The appellant was born on 4 April 1995 and is a  citizen  of  Portugal.
    He came to the United Kingdom in 2010 at the  age  of  15.  It  is  not
    disputed before us that as he then went into education and his  parents
    were exercising Treaty rights,  he  acquired  the  right  of  permanent
    residence in line with Regulation 15 in 2015.

 4. The appellant was first convicted of an offence on 14 March  2013,  the
    offence  being  theft  by  shoplifting.   He  received  a   conditional
    discharge of twelve months.

 5. On 27 April 2013 the appellant  was  cautioned  by  police  for  using
    threatening, abusive, insulting words or behaviour with intent to cause
    fear or provocation of violence.

 6. On 17 November 2015 he was convicted  of  battery,  sexual  assault -
    intentionally touching a female - no penetration  and  two  counts  of
    failing to surrender to custody at an appointed time.  He was sentenced
    to a total of ten weeks' imprisonment and ordered to  pay  compensation
    of �50, a victim surcharge of �80 and  a  criminal  courts'  charge  of
    �1,000.  He was also ordered to sign the  sex  offenders  register  for
    seven years.

 7. On 31 May 2018 the appellant was convicted of failure to  comply  with
    the sex offender registration notification requirements.  He was  given
    a fine of �120 and a victim surcharge of �30.

 8. On 9 October 2018 the appellant was convicted of supplying  a  class  B
    controlled drug - cannabis and possession with intent to supply  of  a
    controlled drug of class B - cannabis.  On 22  November  2018  he  was
    sentenced to eight months' imprisonment.

 9. Following the conviction in 2018 for supplying and possessing cannabis,
    the respondent commenced deportation action. On 22 December 2018 he was
    served with a liability to deport notice.  He provided a response on  9
    January 2019.  On 23 January 2019 a notice of  a  decision  to  make  a
    deportation order was made and a deportation  order  was  signed.   The
    appellant made representations requesting that the respondent  overturn
    that decision but on 6 February  2019  the  respondent  maintained  the
    deportation order.

10. The appellant lodged an appeal to the First-tier Tribunal.  The  appeal
    was heard by the First-tier Tribunal on 9 April  2019  and,  as  above,
    allowed in a decision issued on  27  June  2019.   First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Howard heard evidence from the appellant and  his  partner,  with
    whom he has a child.  Evidence was also given by the appellant's mother
    and his father.

11. In paragraphs 17 to 23 of his decision in,  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Howard set out various legal provisions and case law  relevant  to  the
    deportation of an EEA national. In paragraphs 24 to 25 and 28 to 34 the
    judge set out his assessment of whether the appellant could be deported
    or had the protection provided by the EEA Regulations for someone  with
    permanent residence:

         "24.     The appellant's antecedent history demonstrates  sporadic,
             but increasingly serious offending.  The record also  suggests
             he has resisted all attempts at rehabilitation.

         25.  It is also the case that more recently he has made genuine and
             persistent efforts  to  rehabilitate  himself  by  undertaking
             whatever courses were available to him while detained.  On the
             evidence before  me  this  represents  a  sea  change  in  the
             attitude of  the  appellant  towards  his  offending.   It  is
             further borne out by what has been saud (sic) to me about  his
             attitude to  both  his  partner  and  their  child  since  his
             release.  He has all the hallmarks of  a  reformed  character.
             This should perhaps not be surprising as  it  is  one  of  the
             principles of sentencing.

         ...

         28.  The appellant is entitled to the higher degree  of  protection
             afforded to him by Regulation 27(3), namely that a deportation
             decision cannot be made except on serious  grounds  of  public
             policy and public security.

         29.  When considering the  Court  of  Appeal's  judgment  in  Essa,
             neither the respondent or the appellant has provided  me  with
             an OASys Report or  other  Probation  Service  material.   The
             appellant  has  however  provided  me   with   a   number   of
             certificates showing the rehabilitative work he has undertaken
             while in immigration detention.  I am satisfied  that  he  has
             demonstrated to the  lower  standard  of  proof  that  he  has
             undertaken rehabilitative work whilst in custody.

         30.   I  have  considered  the  question  of  proportionality  with
             reference to Regulation  27(6).   Accordingly  I  am  required
             specifically to consider his age, state of health, family  and
             economic situation, his length  of  residence  in  the  United
             Kingdom, and his social and cultural integration.

         31.  He gave evidence before me in English.  All the qualifications
             he has attained were taken in English.  He has worked and  has
             a genuine offer of work in the future.  He has established his
             social and cultural integration.  He has been in  the  UK  for
             ten years.  He  is  24  years  old.   In  term  (sic)  of  his
             acquiring skills to prepare him for adult life they have  been
             acquired in the UK and the length  of  his  residence  in  the
             context of his life is significant.  His economic situation is
             one of dependence at this moment, but as I have already  found
             there is a genuine offer of work.

         32.  His family situation requires separate consideration.  He is a
             father and partner.  I heard a great  deal  of  evidence  from
             both the appellant and his partner [AK]  about  the  role  the
             appellant  plays  in  the  life  of  his  daughter  [Z].   The
             appellant and [AK] met at the beginning of 2015 and they  have
             been together in a relationship since that time.  [Z] was born
             on 24 February 2018.  The appellant was present at her  birth.
             He was detained when she was 7 months old.  [AK] took  her  to
             see him when in immigration detention.  The paternal bond  was
             re-established and it has remained unbroken since then.   Both
             spoke of the roles the appellant  fulfils  in  his  daughter's
             life, suffice to say they are all any father would  undertake.
             [AK] was asked  a  number  of  questions  about  her  attitude
             towards the appellant and his offending.  She is aware of  all
             of his  past  offending  and  understands  the  importance  of
             stability in  all  their  lives  in  mitigating  the  risk  of
             reoffending.  She is committed to providing stability.

         33.  The appellant is in good health.

         34.  These are  the  matters  I  must  consider  in  assessing  the
             proportionality of deportation.  The appellant's offending  is
             significant albeit committed when young.   He  has  sought  to
             rehabilitate himself and established a very strong family life
             with his child and partner.  He has  not  reoffended  and  has
             abided by the terms of his licence and bail.  It is  the  work
             the appellant has  done,  both  formally  while  detained  and
             informally in re-establishing himself in  the  community  that
             permit me to say that the required serious grounds for  public
             security required by Regulation 27(6) are not made out in this
             case as the  appellant  has  shown  himself  genuinely  to  be
             rehabilitated."

12. The grounds maintain, firstly, that that the decision failed to set out
    an  explicit  finding  on  whether  Regulation  27(5)(c)  of  the   EEA
    Regulations was met, that is,  whether  the  appellant  represented  "a
    genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one  of  the
    fundamental interests of society". The respondent  submitted  that  the
    fact that the decision went on to assess proportionality suggested that
    the First-tier Tribunal did  find  that  the  appellant  represented  a
    sufficient threat, albeit conceding that this might merely show a "belt
    and braces" approach.

13.  Secondly,  the  grounds  argue  that  the  assessment  conflated   the
    provisions set out in Regulation  27(5)(c)  and  Regulation  27(3)  and
    confused matters further by referring in  paragraph  34  to  Regulation
    27(6). The grounds also refer to  an  unclear  approach  to  Regulation
    27(5)(a) and maintain that the confused approach  to  these  provisions
    "called into question the judgement as a  whole"  and  amounted  to  an
    error of law.

14. Regulation 27(3) sets out the "medium" level of protection for  someone
    with permanent residence,  requiring  there  to  be  "serious  grounds"
    justifying deportation.

15. Regulation 27(5)(a) states that the decision  to  deport  "must  comply
    with the principle of proportionality".

16. Regulation 27(5)(c) provides that:

         "the personal conduct of  the  person  must  represent  a  genuine,
         present and  sufficiently  serious  threat  affecting  one  of  the
         fundamental interests of society, taking into account past  conduct
         of the person and that the threat does not have to be imminent."

17. Regulation 27(6) sets out considerations of which account must be taken
    before deporting an EEA national, such as age,  state  of  health,  the
    appellant's family and economic situation,  his  length  of  residence,
    cultural integration and links with his country of origin.

18. We have set out all of paragraphs 24 to 25 and 28 to 34 of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal's decision above as it is our view that, read fairly  and
    as a whole, they show that Judge Howard  made  sufficiently  clear  and
    legally correct findings such that the decision cannot be found to show
    a material error on a point of law.

19. When reaching this conclusion we were mindful of the  learning  of  the
    higher courts of the need for the Upper  Tribunal  to  be  cautious  in
    finding fault in the reasoning of the  First-tier  Tribunal.  This  has
    been most recently considered by the Court of Appeal in UT (Sri  Lanka)
    V SSHD [2019] EWCA Civ 1095. In UT (Sri  Lanka)  the  Court  of  Appeal
    state, at paragraph 19:


         "... it is not the case that the UT is entitled to remake the
         decision of the FTT simply because it does not agree with it, or
         because it thinks it can produce a better one. Thus, the reasons
         given for considering there to be an error of law really matter.
         Baroness Hale put it in this way in AH (Sudan) v Secretary of State
         for the Home Department at [30]:


             "Appellate courts should not rush to find such misdirections
             simply because they might have reached a different conclusion
             on the facts or expressed themselves differently."

20. The Court of Appeal went on to state in paragraphs 26 and 27:


         "26. ...  If an error of law based on inadequate reasoning is to be
         identified, however, one must venture beyond general, literary
         criticism of this kind. In R (Jones) v First Tier Tribunal and
         Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority [2013] UKSC 19, Lord Hope
         said (at paragraph 25):


             "It is well established, as an aspect of tribunal law and
             practice, that judicial restraint should be exercised when the
             reasons that a tribunal gives for its decision are being
             examined. The appellate court should not assume too readily
             that the tribunal misdirected itself just because not every
             step in its reasoning is fully set out in it."


         27.  In R v Immigration Appeal Tribunal, ex parte Khan [1983] QB
         790 (per Lord Lane CJ at page 794) it was explained that the issues
         which the tribunal is deciding and the basis on which the tribunal
         reaches its decision may be set out directly or by inference. If a
         tribunal fails to do this then the decision may be quashed. He
         continued:


             "The reason is this. A party appearing before a Tribunal is
             entitled to know, either expressly stated by it or
             inferentially stated, what it is to which the Tribunal is
             addressing its mind. In some cases it may be perfectly obvious
             without any express reference to it by the Tribunal; in other
             cases it may not. Second, the Appellant is entitled to know
             the basis of fact on which the conclusion has been reached.
             Once again in many cases it may be quite obvious without the
             necessity of expressly stating it, in others it may not."
             (emphasis supplied)"

21. After considering the First-tier Tribunal decision and the respondent's
    grounds in line with this guidance, we were satisfied that the decision
    shows the basis on which the appellant met the provisions  of  the  EEA
    Regulations such that he could not be deported.

22. Certainly, the decision could have set out a more precise finding  that
    a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one of the
    fundamental interests of society at the  "serious"  level  required  by
    Regulation 27(3) was not shown by this appellant. However, it is  clear
    that Judge Howard found that  the  appellant  was  at  a  low  risk  of
    reoffending, an important factor when  assessing  whether  there  is  a
    genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat.  Paragraph  25  shows
    clearly that it was Judge Howard's view on this point and sets out  his
    reasons. They are not  inconsistent  with  paragraph  24  which  merely
    refers to an earlier period in the appellant's history. The judge  also
    refers in paragraph 29 to his acceptance  of  the  rehabilitative  work
    done by the appellant. In paragraph 34  he  sets  out  again  that  the
    appellant has "sought to rehabilitate himself"  and  that  he  had  not
    reoffended and complied with conditions since his release from  prison.
    The final sentence of paragraph 34 states that  "the  required  serious
    grounds ... are not made out".

23. Taking these  findings  together,  it  was  our  conclusion  that  they
    afforded only one answer to the  question  of  whether  the  First-tier
    Tribunal judge found that there were serious grounds of  public  policy
    and public security justifying deportation. He did not. It was also our
    view that, in the context of the  clear  findings  on  a  significantly
    changed attitude to reoffending and the appellant having  rehabilitated
    since his last offence it was quite  possible  that  the  reference  to
    Regulation  27(6)  in  the  final  sentence  of  paragraph  34  was   a
    typographic  error  and  should  have  read  "Regulation   27(3)".   If
    "Regulation 27(3)" is substituted, the sentence is  an  entirely  clear
    statement that the judge found that the "serious" grounds threshold was
    not met.

24. Our conclusion is therefore that the First-tier Tribunal judge  made  a
    sufficiently clear finding that the evidence  did  not  show  that  the
    appellant posed a genuine,  present  and  sufficiently  serious  threat
    affecting one of the fundamental interests of society at the  "serious"
    level required for the deportation of someone with permanent residence.
    Read fairly, the decision  shows  the  respondent  that  this  was  the
    conclusion reached and sets out rational reasons for that conclusion.

25. That being so, there is no need to go on to consider whether the First-
    tier Tribunal took an irrational or otherwise unlawful approach in  the
    proportionality assessment. That could only be  material if the  First-
    tier Tribunal had found that there were  "serious"  grounds  justifying
    deportation, that being the trigger for the exercise of  the  power  to
    deport - see Dumliauskas [2015] EWCA Civ 145 at [40]  In any event,  it
    is again our view that reading the decision  fairly  and  as  a  whole,
    particularly  paragraphs  30  to  33,  the  judge  clearly  found  that
    deportation would not be proportionate. All of  the  findings  made  in
    those paragraphs are  positive  for  the  appellant.  That  reading  is
    consistent with the conclusion in  paragraph  34,  albeit,  again,  the
    judge could have been more precise.

26. For all of these reasons we did not find that  the  grounds  of  appeal
    showed a material error on a point of law in the decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal.

Decision

27. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal does not  disclose  a  material
    error on a point of law and shall stand.
