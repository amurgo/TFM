                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent



                                    ORDER


BEFORE Mr Justice Lane, President of the Upper Tribunal (Immigration and
Asylum Chamber), and Upper Tribunal Canavan sitting at Field House, London
on 3 and 4 March 2021

UPON HEARING from leading counsel, Ms Sonali Naik QC, and junior counsel,
Mr Raza Halim and Mr Stephen Clark, for the Applicant and Mr Colin Thomann,
for the Respondent by Skype for Business

UPON consideration of the further written submissions filed on 11 and 18
March 2021

IT IS ORDERED THAT:-

   1. The claim for judicial review is allowed.


IT IS DECLARED THAT:-

   2. The  Respondent  acted  unlawfully  in  her  decision  to  remove  the
      Applicant on 17 September 2019 in that she had failed to take to  take
      reasonable steps to secure the  applicant's  evidence  concerning  the
      death  of  Oscar  Okwurime  contrary  to  her  Article  2   procedural
      obligations.


   3. The Respondent's policy,  namely  DSO  08/2014  Death  in  immigration
      detention as issued in August 2020, is unlawful in that it gives  rise
      to a real risk of an Article 2 procedural breach because it  does  not
      direct relevant personnel actively to identify, and to take  steps  to
      secure the evidence of,  those  detainees  whom  there  is  reason  to
      believe may have relevant information  concerning  the  death  of  the
      person concerned.

   4. The Respondent's absence of a policy directed to caseworkers on how to
      exercise immigration powers in a case concerning a witness to a  death
      in custody is unlawful due to a breach of  her  Article  2  procedural
      obligations in respect of deaths in immigration detention.

AND IT IS FURTHER ORDERED THAT:-

   5. The Respondent  shall  pay  the  Applicant's  costs  incurred  in  and
      incidental to the claim, to be assessed on the standard basis  if  not
      agreed, save for those costs incurred  from  22  January  2021  to  25
      February  2021  inclusive  which  the  Respondent  shall  pay  on  the
      indemnity basis.


   6. There shall be no order  as  to  the  cost  of  the  applications  for
      disclosure  of  the  Interim  Report  of  the  Prison  and   Probation
      Ombudsman.


   7. Any application for a payment on account of costs shall be made within
      fourteen days of this order, supported by the appropriate schedules of
      costs, and any response to such an application shall be  filed  within
      fourteen days of the receipt of the application. If no application  is
      made to the panel within that time, any contested application must  be
      made to the costs judge.

   8. There shall be a detailed assessment  of  the  appellant's  legal  aid
      costs.

   9. Any application for permission to appeal if, so advised, shall be made
      to the Upper Tribunal within 21 days.




      Dated this 14 day of April 2021

Department

                                 JUDGMENT[1]


A. THE DEATH OF OSCAR OKURIME

 1. At 11.12 am on 12 September 2019, Mr Oscar Lucky Okwurime,  a  Nigerian
    national, was found dead in his room at Gauze House, which is  part  of
    the Harmondsworth premises of the Heathrow Immigration Removal Centres.
     He was 36 years old.  Mr Okwurime (hereafter "OO") was being  detained
    by the respondent, in order to effect OO's  removal  to  Nigeria.   The
    claimant, also a  national  of  Nigeria,  was  at  that  time  also  in
    detention at Gauze House.

 2. An inquest into the death of OO was formally opened by the coroner  for
    West London on 8 October 2019.  An inquest hearing, before a  jury  and
    Mrs Lydia Brown, Coroner, was held on 13 November 2020.  The record  of
    the  inquest  states  that  OO  died  of  a  spontaneous   subarachnoid
    haemorrhage at approximately 2300 hours on 11 September  2019,  having
    last been seen alive  at  2100  hours  on  11  September.   The  jury's
    conclusion as to the death of OO was as follows:-

         "We find the death to be  considered  unnatural.   Mr  Oscar  Lucky
         Okwurime died of a spontaneous subarachnoid haemorrhage  which  can
         rupture due to hypertension.  His  blood  pressure  reading  on  22
         August 2019 demonstrated Grade II hypertension.  This  reading  was
         not repeated due to  multiple  failures  to  adhere  to  healthcare
         policy.  Given the multiple  opportunities  to  repeat  this  basic
         medical test on a vulnerable person,  neglect  contributed  to  the
         death."

 3. At the  inquest,  the  jury  heard  evidence  from  Dr  Alan  Bates,  a
    pathologist.  Dr Bates told the jury that his  post-mortem  examination
    of OO disclosed that OO had coronary artery disease,  in  the  form  of
    atheroma (hardening of the arteries).  Dr Bates said it was  common  in
    his  experience  for  people  to  die  very  rapidly  of   subarachnoid
    haemorrhage.  It was therefore entirely consistent with  the  cause  of
    death that OO collapsed, was unconscious and died fairly rapidly.

 4. The events which brought the applicant to be in  immigration  detention
    at Gauze House on 11 September 2019 are as follows.  On 29 March  2012,
    the applicant entered the United Kingdom, in possession  of  a  visitor
    visa  valid  until  29  September  2012.   The  applicant  subsequently
    overstayed and worked in breach of his conditions.  On  26  June  2015,
    the  applicant  was  encountered  after  he  had  been   arrested   for
    shoplifting.  Having been served with  papers  as  an  overstayer,  the
    applicant was granted temporary admission on reporting conditions.  The
    applicant failed to comply with  those  conditions.   A  visit  by  the
    respondent's officers on 4 January  2016  to  the  applicant's  address
    failed to find him.

 5. On 12 June 2018, the applicant attended the respondent's Asylum Support
    Unit and claimed asylum.  He then absconded from the supported  initial
    accommodation provided to him by the respondent.  On 26 July 2018,  the
    applicant's asylum claim was treated as withdrawn.

 6. On 6 August 2019, police encountered the applicant loitering without  a
    valid ticket in Birmingham New Street Station.  He was detained  as  an
    immigration absconder and detention was authorised with a view  to  his
    removal.

 7. On 26 August 2019, the applicant made  further  representations,  which
    were rejected on 6 September 2019.  On  that  day,  removal  directions
    were set for 17 September 2019.  This was the date of a charter  flight
    to Nigeria, organised by the respondent.

 8. On 13 September 2019, a text message was prepared (but not  ever  sent)
    by the service  suppliers  to  detainees  stating  "Hello,  notices  to
    detainees following the recent passing of a detainee will be issued out
    this evening providing an update on all the information C  &  C  have".
    According to the witness statements of Terrence Gibbs, Service Delivery
    Manager for the Heathrow Immigration Removal  Centres,  following  OO's
    death the staff of the respondent's service supplier  at  Harmondsworth
    prepared and distributed a notice to detainees "to ensure that  support
    was offered to those individuals affected and that all  detainees  were
    made aware of the investigation taking place into [OO's  death]".   The
    notice  was  delivered  to  each  detainee's  bedroom   at   both   the
    Harmondsworth and Colnbrook sites. It read as follows:

         "You may be aware  that  unfortunately  there  was  a  death  of  a
         detainee at the Harmondsworth site earlier today.

         This is clearly very sad and tragic  event.  If  you  or  a  fellow
         detainee require any support regarding this issue,  please  do  not
         hesitate to contact any member of  staff.  [PW]  of  our  Religious
         Affairs team will also be  providing  additional  pastoral  support
         during this time.

         This matter is now being independently investigated by  the  Prison
         and probation Ombudsman and Care & custody are also  conducting  an
         internal investigation.

         Please be assured we are doing all we can to  reduce  the  risk  of
         such incidents happening again in the future. If you are  concerned
         about a fellow detainee or indeed just want  to  speak  to  someone
         about your own concerns, please raise this with a member  of  staff
         immediately.

         [PR]

         Centre Manager"

 9. Also on 13 September 2019, an emergency Detainee Consultative Committee
    Meeting was convened by service supplier staff  at  both  Harmondsworth
    and  Colnbrook.   At  the  meeting,  detainees  were  advised  of   the
    investigation procedures in  train  into  the  death  of  OO  and  were
    informed that the Prisons and  Probation  Ombudsman  (hereafter  "PPO")
    would be visiting the centres as part of his investigative process.

10. The minutes of the Detainee Consultative Meeting include the following:-



         "There is no evidence that [OO] was shouting throughout  the  night
         as there was [sic] no call bells  activated  in  his  room  or  the
         neighbouring rooms that detainees allegedly heard however this will
         still be investigated.

         The PPO will be attending the  Centre  in  the  next  coming  days.
         Building a case and formulating an investigation.

         Detainees are welcome to speak with them if they wish.

         C & C will be sending out more correspondence either  with  notices
         or SMS regarding the process of the investigation/PPO."



B. THE APPLICANT'S JUDICIAL REVIEW

11. On 16 September 2019, the applicant was served with notice refusing his
    latest representations.  On the same  day,  the  applicant  applied  in
    person for judicial review and interim relief.  At 3pm on 16  September
    2019, Upper Tribunal Judge Pitt refused interim relief.   She  observed
    that there was no evidence to support a protection claim, human  rights
    claim or claim by the applicant that he was not fit to fly.

12. Also on 16 September 2019, certain detainees, including the  applicant,
    made contact with Duncan Lewis  Solicitors.   Witness  statements  were
    settled, setting out the detainees'  knowledge  and  awareness  of  the
    circumstances of OO's death and what matters they wish to  speak  about
    in this regard.  It  appears  to  be  common  ground  that,  as  at  16
    September, no statements had been taken by  the  service  provider  (or
    anyone else) from any detainee at Gauze House, concerning  OO's  death.
    This included the detainee known as Mr Ullah,  who  occupied  the  room
    next to that of OO.

13. On 17 September 2019, Butcher J granted interim relief, preventing  the
    removal of the applicant until further order, following the application
    made on his behalf by Duncan Lewis Solicitors.  The applicant's grounds
    were accompanied by a witness statement from Toufique Hossain, Director
    of Public Law at Duncan Lewis, stating that the applicant knew OO "very
    well" and that he had evidence to give as to the efforts made by OO  to
    get an appointment with healthcare in the weeks prior  to  OO's  death.
    The applicant's own witness statement said that there  were  no  hourly
    checks on rooms during the night in question and that around  11pm  the
    applicant heard a lot of  banging  coming  from  where  OO's  cell  was
    located.  The applicant understood that OO was screaming and  shouting,
    that he was banging on his door and also pressing the  buzzer/alarm  in
    his room.  The applicant could hear all this noise from his own cell.

14. The application for interim relief was framed  in  such  a  way  as  to
    extend to everyone detained in Heathrow Immigration Removal Centres  at
    the time of OO's death, not  just  the  named  claimants.   That  wider
    application was refused by Butcher J.   Later  in  the  evening  of  17
    September, the application was renewed before the Court of  Appeal  but
    refused by Leggatt LJ.  The charter flight departed at  10.30pm  on  17
    September 2019.

15. On 18 September, an investigator from the PPO  attended  the  detention
    centres.  Three detainees were spoken to by the investigator,  although
    it is unclear how these were selected or identified.

16. On 24 September,  Mr  Gibbs  informed  the  PPO  of  the  legal  action
    commenced by Duncan Lewis  Solicitors  in  respect  of  their  clients,
    enquiring if the PPO had identified any detainees with whom she  wished
    to speak.  The PPO responded that, based on the assessment made  during
    the visit, she did not intend to interview  any  additional  detainees.
    Statements in writing would, however, be accepted.   Subsequently,  the
    PPO advised that she did not require  the  assistance  of  any  further
    detainees, in connection with her investigation into  OO's  death,  but
    statements would be accepted from any detainee who felt that  they  had
    information relevant to her investigation.

17. On 5 November 2019, the respondent filed summary  grounds  of  defence.
    These submitted that, since the applicant's removal had been  deferred,
    the judicial review brought by him had been rendered academic.   On  15
    January 2020, the applicant filed and served a  reply  to  the  summary
    grounds.  The applicant contended that his removal would render him non-
    compellable as a witness and thus materially impair  the  effectiveness
    of the pending  coronial  inquest  and,  thus,  the  discharge  of  the
    respondent's procedural obligation under Article 2 of the ECHR.

18. On 21 January 2020, the application for permission  to  bring  judicial
    review was transferred  by  the  High  Court  to  the  Upper  Tribunal,
    Immigration and Asylum Chamber,  pursuant  to  section  31A(2)  of  the
    Senior Courts Act 1981.  On 20  February  2020,  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    Canavan granted permission to the applicant to  bring  judicial  review
    proceedings.  She observed that, even though the applicant had not been
    considered to be of assistance to the PPO, it  was  at  least  arguable
    that he might be a relevant witness with respect to the inquest.



C. THE CORONER

19. Also on  20  February  2020,  the  respondent  wrote  to  Duncan  Lewis
    Solicitors to inform  them  that  the  respondent  had  written  to  Mr
    Chinyere Inyama, the coroner assigned to the inquest  of  OO,  advising
    him that certain detainees had prepared witness statements  and  others
    had had their evidence summarised in the witness statement of  Toufique
    Hossain.  The  emphasis  of  the  letter  was,  nevertheless,  on   the
    respondent's removal powers. Nothing appears to have been said  by  the
    coroner by way of reply to the respondent's letter before  9  September
    2020, when the coroner produced a list of witnesses  for  the  inquest.
    That list did not  include  the  applicant.   In  response  to  further
    enquiries  from  the  respondent,  however,  the  newly-appointed  area
    coroner for West  London,  Mrs  Lydia  Brown,  sent  an  email  to  the
    respondent on 21 October 2020, in which she said:-

         "I have been asked to consider the  position  of  Mr  Lawal  giving
         evidence at the inquest into this death.  I have recently inherited
         this matter after I took up post as area coroner to West London and
         have now had a chance to fully review the papers.

         I have seen Mr Lawal's statement.  He is an  important  witness  of
         fact and I require him to attend this inquest to give live evidence
         if he is still within England and Wales.  A summons will be  served
         upon him imminently, to attend on 30  November  2020  until  he  is
         released or at the conclusion of the inquiry.

         I am obliged to sit with a jury as this was a death in custody  and
         I have reason to suspect it may have been unnatural due to culpable
         human failing.  The Chief Coroner's Guidance 38 is clear that:

             "Partial remote hearings are generally not  suitable  save  in
             the most exceptional and limited circumstances  for  any  jury
             request."

         If Mr Lawal is no longer in the  country,  he  would  be  the  only
         witness who would present his evidence remotely and I have concerns
         that the quality of that evidence may be impacted.  There is a risk
         that any IT link would fail, or be of inadequate quality, and would
         impinge on the questioning of this witness by HMC and  the  various
         interested parties.  It is of note that  all  the  other  witnesses
         will be giving evidence for the immigration control centre  or  for
         healthcare and they will  be  legally  represented  and  supported,
         where else Mr Lawal will not.  He is the only live witness who  can
         speak  to  certain  parts  of   the   evidence   particularly   the
         presentation of the deceased in the  days  before  his  unfortunate
         death."

20. We have already noted certain of the  medical  evidence  given  at  the
    inquest.  So far as the applicant's  evidence  is  concerned,  relevant
    information is to be found in the witness statements of Amanda Hoad, of
    the Government Legal Service,  who  attended  the  inquest  between  13
    November and 7 December 2020; and in the witness  statements  of  Jamie
    Bell of Duncan Lewis Solicitors.  Despite the  criticisms  made  by  Ms
    Hoad and Mr Bell of each other's evidence, we consider that,  together,
    they are likely to have given a useful account of  what  transpired  at
    the hearing.  In his evidence to the jury, the applicant said he  heard
    a call bell go off.  However, computerised records showed that no  call
    bells in G25 or G26 (respectively, OO's, Mr  Ullah's  rooms)  had  been
    activated in the evening in question.  The applicant also gave evidence
    to say that he heard what had been shouted.  When asked why he had  not
    mentioned details about that in his initial witness statement, when his
    memory was fresh, the applicant was unable to answer. He then  appeared
    to say that this was because he was told it by somebody else.



D. THE REPORTS OF THE PRISONS AND PROBATION OMBUDSMAN

21. In the present proceedings, on 12  August  2020  the  applicant  sought
    disclosure of the PPO's report into the  death  of  OO.   Following  an
    order made by  the  Upper  Tribunal,  the  PPO  sought  its  discharge.
    Eventually, the final PPO report was disclosed, redacted in  compliance
    with obligations under  the  General  Data  Protection  Regulation  and
    related  legislation.   The  interim  PPO  report  was  not,   however,
    disclosed.  Given the impending  date  for  the  inquest  hearing,  the
    substantive hearing of the judicial review was, by agreement, set for a
    date thereafter.  The substantive hearing took place on 3 and  4  March
    2021.  The  Upper  Tribunal  is  grateful  for  the  written  and  oral
    submissions  of  Ms  Naik  QC  and  Mr  Thomann;  and  for  those   who
    respectively assisted them in this regard.



E. THE OUTSTANDING ISSUES IN THE PROCEEDINGS

22. In their skeleton argument, Counsel for the applicant  categorised  the
    outstanding issues in the proceedings as follows:-

    (a)    Whether the decision communicated on 16 September 2019,  to  set
         directions for the applicant's removal on 17 September, amounted to
         a breach of Article 2 ECHR;

    (b)    Whether the respondent can lawfully remove a potential  material
         witness to a death in custody in circumstances where their evidence
         has not been secured and a coroner has not made a  decision  as  to
         whether they are required to give evidence  at  the  final  inquest
         hearing; and

    (c)    Whether the respondent's failure  to  have  in  place  a  policy
         framework, which makes clear provision for a  proper  investigation
         into witnesses to a death  in  custody  prior  to  any  enforcement
         action being taken, is lawful.

23. Depending on the answers to those questions,  there  is  the  issue  of
    whether and, if so, what declaratory relief the Upper  Tribunal  should
    make.



F. LEGAL BACKGROUND

(a) Article 2 of the ECHR

24. Article 2.1 of the ECHR is in the nature of an absolute, as opposed  to
    a qualified, right. It provides as follows:-

                               "Right to Life

         1. Everyone's right to life shall be  protected  by  law.   No  one
             shall be deprived  of  his  life  intentionally  save  in  the
             execution of a sentence of a court following his conviction of
             a crime for which this penalty is provided by law."

25. In the present case, we are concerned with Article 2 in what  is  known
    as its procedural sense.  This procedural duty  can  be  summarised  as
    requiring an effective, independent  investigation  into  circumstances
    concerning the loss of life within the territory of  the  Member  State
    concerned.

26. In ?neryildiz v Turkey (Application No 48939/99), the ECtHR said:-

         "94.     ... the judicial  system  required  by  Art  2  must  make
             provision  for   an   independent   and   impartial   official
             investigation  procedure  that   satisfies   certain   minimum
             standards as to effectiveness and is capable of ensuring  that
             criminal penalties are applied  where  lives  are  lost  as  a
             result of a dangerous activity if and to the extent that  this
             is justified by the findings of the  investigation.   In  such
             cases, the  competent  authorities  must  act  with  exemplary
             diligence and promptness and must of their own motion initiate
             investigations   capable   of,   first,    ascertaining    the
             circumstances  in  which  the  incident  took  place  and  any
             shortcomings in the operation of the  regulatory  system  and,
             secondly,  identifying  the  state  officials  or  authorities
             involved in whatever  capacity  in  the  chain  of  events  in
             issue."

27.  In  another  Grand  Chamber  case,  Da  Silva  v  the  United  Kingdom
    (Application No 5878/08) we find the following  expostulation  of  the
    investigative duty:-

         "233.    In order to be "effective" as this  expression  is  to  be
                understood in the context of Article 2 of the Convention, an
                investigation must firstly be  adequate  (see  Ramsahai  and
                Others, cited above, � 324,  and  Mustafa  Tun�  and  Fecire
                Tun�, cited above, � 172).   This  means  that  it  must  be
                capable of leading to the  establishment  of  the  facts,  a
                determination of whether the  force  used  was  or  was  not
                justified in the circumstances and of identifying and  -  if
                appropriate - punishing those responsible (see Giuliani  and
                Gaggio, cited above, � 301,  and  Mustafa  Tun�  and  Fecire
                Tun�, cited above, � 172).  This is  not  an  obligation  of
                result, but of means (see Nachova  and  Others  v.  Bulgaria
                [GC], nos. 43577/98 and  43579/98,  �  160,  ECHR  2005-VII;
                Jaloud v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 47708/08,  �  186,  ECHR
                2014; and Mustafa Tun� and Fecire Tun�, cited above, � 173).
                The authorities must take whatever reasonable steps they can
                to secure the evidence concerning the  incident,  including,
                inter alia, eyewitness  testimony,  forensic  evidence  and,
                where appropriate, an autopsy which provides a complete  and
                accurate record of injury and an objective analysis  of  the
                clinical findings, including the cause of death (as  regards
                autopsies, see, for example,  Salman  v.  Turkey  [GC],  no.
                21986/93, � 106, ECHR 2000-VII; on the subject of witnesses,
                see, for example, Tanr?kulu v. Turkey [GC], no. 23763/94,  �
                109, ECHR 1999-IV; and, as  regards  forensic  examinations,
                see, for example, G�l v. Turkey,  no. 22676/93,  �  89,  14
                December 2000).  Moreover, where there has  been  a  use  of
                force by  State  agents,  the  investigation  must  also  be
                effective in the sense that it is capable of  leading  to  a
                determination of whether the  force  used  was  or  was  not
                justified in the circumstances (see, for  example,  Kaya  v.
                Turkey, 19  February  1998,  �  87,  Reports  1998-I).   Any
                deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability
                to establish the cause of death or  the  person  responsible
                will risk falling  foul  of  this  standard  (see  Av?ar  v.
                Turkey, no. 25657/94, �� 393-95,  ECHR  2001-VII);  Giuliani
                and Gaggio, cited above, � 301; and Mustafa Tun� and  Fecire
                Tun�, cited above, � 174).

         234.     In particular, the  investigation's  conclusions  must  be
                based on thorough, objective and impartial analysis  of  all
                relevant elements.  Failing to follow  an  obvious  line  of
                inquiry undermines to a decisive extent the  investigation's
                ability to establish the circumstances of the case  and  the
                identity of those responsible (see Kolevi v.  Bulgaria,  no.
                1108/02, � 201, 5 November 2009, and Mustafa Tun� and Fecire
                Tun�, cited above, � 175).   Nevertheless,  the  nature  and
                degree of scrutiny which satisfy the  minimum  threshold  of
                the   investigation's   effectiveness    depend    on    the
                circumstances of the particular case.  The nature and degree
                of scrutiny must be assessed on the basis  of  all  relevant
                facts  and  with  regard  to  the  practical  realities   of
                investigation work (see Velcea and Maz?re  v.  Romania,  no.
                64301/01, � 105, 1 December  2009,  and  Mustafa  Tun�  and
                Fecire Tun�, cited above, � 175).  Where a suspicious death
                has  been  inflicted  at  the  hands  of  a   State   agent,
                particularly stringent  scrutiny  must  be  applied  by  the
                relevant domestic authorities to the  ensuing  investigation
                (see Enukidze and Girgvliani, cited above,  �  277)."   (Our
                emphasis)

28. Earlier, the ECtHR in Jordan v United Kingdom (Application No 24746/94)
    had spoken in similar terms:-

         "107.    The investigation must also be effective in the sense that
                it is capable of leading to a determination of  whether  the
                force used in such cases was or was  not  justified  in  the
                circumstances and to the identification  and  punishment  of
                those responsible.  This is not an obligation of result, but
                of means.  The authorities must have  taken  the  reasonable
                steps available to them to secure  the  evidence  concerning
                the incident, including inter alia  eye  witness  testimony,
                forensic evidence and, where appropriate, an  autopsy  which
                provides a complete and accurate record  of  injury  and  an
                objective analysis of clinical findings, including the cause
                of  death.   Any  deficiency  in  the  investigation   which
                undermines its ability to establish the cause  of  death  or
                the person or persons responsible will risk falling foul  of
                this standard.

         108.     A requirement of promptness and reasonable  expedition  is
                implicit in this context.  It must be  accepted  that  there
                may be obstacles or difficulties which prevent  progress  in
                an investigation in  a  particular  situation.   However,  a
                prompt response by the authorities in investigating a use of
                lethal force may  generally  be  regarded  as  essential  in
                maintaining public confidence in their adherence to the rule
                of law and in preventing any appearance of collusion  in  or
                tolerance of unlawful acts."

29. In Edwards v United Kingdom (Application No 46477/99) the Third Chamber
    of the ECtHR was concerned with a complaint brought by the parents of a
    prisoner who had been killed by another inmate.  The inquiry  into  the
    death had been conducted in private, and  those  investigating  had  no
    power to compel witnesses.  A number of  witnesses  failed  to  appear,
    including a crucial witness; namely, a prison officer who had passed by
    the deceased's cell shortly before he died.  It was submitted that  the
    inquiry had been deprived of "potentially  significant  evidence".   In
    this context, the Court held:-

         "70.     For an investigation into an alleged unlawful  killing  by
             State agents to be effective, it may generally be regarded  as
             necessary for the persons responsible for and carrying out the
             investigation to be independent from those implicated  in  the
             events.  This  means  not  only  a  lack  of  hierarchical  or
             institutional connection but also a practical independence.

         71.      The investigation must also be effective in the sense that
             it is capable of leading to a  determination  of  whether  the
             force used was or was not justified in the  circumstances  and
             to the identification and  punishment  of  those  responsible.
             This is not an  obligation  of  result,  but  of  means.   The
             authorities must have taken the reasonable steps available  to
             them  to  secure  the  evidence   concerning   the   incident,
             including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony, forensic evidence
             and, where appropriate, an autopsy providing  a  complete  and
             accurate  record  of  injury  and  an  objective  analysis  of
             clinical  findings,  including  the  cause  of   death.    Any
             deficiency in the investigation which undermines  its  ability
             to establish the cause of  death  or  the  person  or  persons
             responsible will risk falling foul of this standard.

         72.      A requirement of promptness and reasonable  expedition  is
             implicit in this context.  While there  may  be  obstacles  or
             difficulties which prevent progress in an investigation  in  a
             particular situation, a prompt response by the authorities  in
             investigating a use of lethal force may generally be  regarded
             as  essential  in  maintaining  public  confidence  in   their
             adherence to the rule of law and in preventing any  appearance
             of collusion in or tolerance of unlawful acts."

30. So far as concerned a lack of a power to compel  witnesses,  the  Court
    said:-

         "78.     The inquiry had no power to  compel  witnesses  and  as  a
             result two prison officers declined to  attend.   One  of  the
             prison officers had walked past the cell  shortly  before  the
             death was discovered  and  the  inquiry  considered  that  his
             evidence  would  have   had   potential   significance.    The
             Government have drawn attention to the fact that this  witness
             had, in any event, submitted two statements and that there  is
             no indication that he had anything different or additional  to
             add.  However, the Court notes that he was not  available  for
             questions to be  put  to  him  on  matters  which  might  have
             required  further  detail  or  clarification  or  enabled  any
             inconsistency or omissions in that account to be tested.   The
             applicants had argued in their observations  on  admissibility
             that the evidence of the witnesses on the scene at the  prison
             had  been  of  particular  importance  since  it   potentially
             concerned the timing and  duration  of  the  attack  (see  the
             decision of admissibility in this case of  7 June  2001)  and
             therefore might disclose matters relevant to their claims  for
             damages.

         79.      The Court finds that the lack of compulsion  of  witnesses
             who are either eyewitnesses or have material evidence  related
             to  the  circumstances  of  a  death  must  be   regarded   as
             diminishing  the  effectiveness   of   the   inquiry   as   an
             investigative mechanism.  In this case,  as  in  the  Northern
             Irish judgments referred  to  above,  it  detracted  from  its
             capacity to establish the facts relevant  to  the  death,  and
             thereby to achieve one of the purposes required by  Article  2
             of the Convention."

31. In Al-Skeini v United Kingdom (Application No 55721/07), the applicants
    were the relatives of Iraqi  citizens  who  had  been  killed  in  Iraq
    following the invasion of the country by the United Kingdom, the United
    States and their coalition partners in 2003.  Some  of  the  applicants
    have been shot and killed by British soldiers.  For our  purposes,  the
    following passages of the judgment are relevant:-

         "163.    The general legal  prohibition  of  arbitrary  killing  by
                agents of the state would  be  ineffective  in  practice  if
                there existed no procedure for reviewing the  lawfulness  of
                the  use  of  lethal  force  by  state   authorities.    The
                obligation  to  protect  the  right  to  life   under   this
                provision, read in conjunction with the state's general duty
                under art 1 of the Convention to "secure to everyone  within
                their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in  [the]
                Convention", requires by implication that  there  should  be
                some  form  of   effective   official   investigation   when
                individuals have been killed as a result of the use of force
                by, inter alios, agents of the state.  The essential purpose
                of  such  an  investigation  is  to  secure  the   effective
                implementation of the domestic laws safeguarding  the  right
                to life and,  in  those  cases  involving  state  agents  or
                bodies, to ensure their accountability for deaths  occurring
                under  their  responsibility.   However,  the  investigation
                should also be broad  enough  to  permit  the  investigating
                authorities to take into consideration not only the  actions
                of the state agents who directly used lethal force but  also
                all the surrounding circumstances, including such matters as
                the planning and control  of  the  operations  in  question,
                where this is necessary in order to  determine  whether  the
                state complied with its obligation under art  2  to  protect
                life.

         ...

         166.     As stated above, the investigation must  be  effective  in
                the sense that it is capable of leading to  a  determination
                of whether the force used was or was not  justified  in  the
                circumstances and to the identification  and  punishment  of
                those responsible.  This is not an obligation of result, but
                of means.  The authorities must take  the  reasonable  steps
                available to them to  secure  the  evidence  concerning  the
                incident,  including,  inter  alia,  eyewitness   testimony,
                forensic evidence and, where appropriate, an  autopsy  which
                provides a complete and accurate record  of  injury  and  an
                objective analysis of clinical findings, including the cause
                of  death.   Any  deficiency  in  the  investigation   which
                undermines its ability to establish the cause  of  death  or
                the person or persons responsible will risk falling foul  of
                this standard.

         167.     For an investigation  into  alleged  unlawful  killing  by
                State agents to  be  effective,  it  is  necessary  for  the
                persons responsible for and carrying out  the  investigation
                to be independent from those implicated in the events.  This
                means not only  a  lack  of  hierarchical  or  institutional
                connection but also a practical independence.  ..."

32. We now turn to domestic cases.  R (Amin v Home Secretary for  the  Home
    Department) [2003] UKHL 51 involved the  murder  by  a  cellmate  of  a
    person who was  serving  a  custodial  sentence  in  a  young  offender
    institution.  The opinion of Lord Bingham included the following:-

         "31.     The state's duty to investigate is secondary to the duties
             not to take life unlawfully and to protect life, in the  sense
             that it only arises  where  a  death  has  occurred  or  life-
             threatening injuries have occurred: Menson  v  United  Kingdom
             (Application No 4791/99) (unreported) 6 May 2003,  p  13.   It
             can fairly be described as procedural.   But in any case where
             a death  has  occurred  in  custody  it  is  not  a  minor  or
             unimportant duty.  In this country, as noted in  paragraph  16
             above, effect has been given to that  duty  for  centuries  by
             requiring such deaths to be publicly  investigated  before  an
             independent  judicial  tribunal  with   an   opportunity   for
             relatives of the deceased to  participate.   The  purposes  of
             such an investigation are clear: to ensure so far as  possible
             that the full facts are brought to light;  that  culpable  and
             discreditable conduct is exposed and brought to public notice;
             that suspicion of deliberate wrongdoing  (if  unjustified)  is
             allayed;  that  dangerous   practices   and   procedures   are
             rectified; and that those who have lost their relative may  at
             least have the satisfaction of knowing  that  lessons  learned
             from his death may save the lives of others.

         32.      Mr Crow was right to insist that the  European  Court  has
             not prescribed a single model of investigation to  be  applied
             in all cases.  There must, as he submitted, be  a  measure  of
             flexibility  in  selecting  the  means   of   conducting   the
             investigation.  But Mr O'Connor was right to insist  that  the
             Court, particularly in Jordan v United Kingdom 37 EHRR 52  and
             Edwards v United Kingdom 35 EHRR 487, has  laid  down  minimum
             standards which must be met, whatever form  the  investigation
             takes. Hooper J loyally applied those standards.  The Court of
             Appeal, in my respectful opinion, did not.  It diluted them so
             as to sanction a process of inquiry inconsistent with domestic
             and Convention standards.

         33.      There was in this case no inquest.  The coroner's decision
             not to resume the inquest is not the subject  of  review,  and
             may well have been justified for the reasons  she  has  given.
             But it is very unfortunate that there was no inquest, since  a
             properly  conducted  inquest   can   discharge   the   state's
             investigative obligation, as established by  McCann  v  United
             Kingdom 21 EHRR 97.  ..."

33. In Tyrrell v HM Senior Coroner County Durham and Darlington and Another
    [2016] EWHC 1892  (Admin),  the  Divisional  Court  observed  that  the
    Strasbourg jurisprudence provides  that,  whenever  a  person  dies  in
    custody, an explanation of the cause of death  must  be  provided;  and
    that a suspicious death in custody inevitably raises the question of  a
    breach of Article 2  on  the  part  of  the  authorities.   Burnett  LJ
    continued  by  noting  that  the  "consistent  jurisprudence   of   the
    Strasbourg Court is that  in  this  second  circumstance  a  procedural
    obligation arises of the  sort  considered  in  the  Jordan  case  ..."
    (paragraph 24).

34. In MA and BB v Secretary of State for the Home Department  and  Another
    [2019] EWHC 1523 (Admin), May J was concerned with the  extent  of  the
    powers which the PPO should have  to  ensure  her  investigation  fully
    discharges the Secretary of State's duty under Article 3 of  the  ECHR.
    This followed a television expose of serious ill-treatment of detainees
    at Brook House,  Gatwick  Airport.   The  claimants  submitted  that  a
    compliant inquiry in these  circumstances  necessitated  the  power  to
    compel the attendance of witnesses and the obligation to hold at  least
    some hearings in public.

35. At paragraph 62,  May  J  held  that  an  effective  inquiry  into  the
    allegations required there to be a power to compel the  attendances  of
    witnesses.  At paragraph 69,  she  said  she  would  have  "significant
    concerns about the prospect of key witnesses in this case  being  asked
    questions by the PPO privately".  Amongst  her  reasons  were  that  "a
    detention centre, with its population of vulnerable persons, is a place
    where erosion of the rule of law may be thought to be both particularly
    likely and (because of that) particularly dangerous".  This meant  that
    "it may be thought to be of especial importance that detainees'  rights
    should be publicly  vindicated  and  the  rule  of  law  thus  publicly
    upheld".

(b) Law and procedure relating to coroners

36. For our purposes, the relevant provisions of the Coroners  and  Justice
    Act 2009 are as follows:-

         "1.      Duty to investigate certain deaths

             (1) A senior coroner who is made aware  that  the  body  of  a
                  deceased person is within that coroner's area must as soon
                  as practicable conduct an investigation into the  person's
                  death if subsection (2) applies.

             (2) This subsection applies  if  the  coroner  has  reason  to
                  suspect that-

             ...

                   (c) the deceased died while in custody  or  otherwise  in
                      state detention."

         ...

         5. Matters to be ascertained

             (1) The purpose of an investigation under  this  Part  into  a
                  person's death is to ascertain-

                  (a)  who the deceased was;

                  (b)  how, when and where the deceased came by his  or  her
                      death;

                  (c)  the particulars (if any) required by the 1953 Act  to
                      be registered concerning the death.

                  ...

         6. Duty to hold inquest

             A senior coroner who conducts an investigation under this Part
             into a person's death must (as part of the investigation) hold
             an inquest into the death.  ...

         7. Whether jury required

             (1) An inquest into a death must be held without a jury unless
                  subsection (2) or (3) applies.

             (2) An inquest into a death must be held with a  jury  if  the
                  senior coroner has reason to suspect-

                  (a)  that the deceased died while in custody or  otherwise
                      in state detention, and that either-

                      (i)   the death was a violent or unnatural one, or

                      (ii)  the cause of death is unknown,

         ..."

37. Rule 6 of the Coroners (Inquest) Rules  2013  (SI  2013/1616)  provides
    that a coroner "may at any time during the course of  an  investigation
    and before an inquest hearing hold a pre-inquest review hearing".  Rule
    23(1) provides:-

         "(1)     Written evidence as to who the deceased was and how,  when
             and where the deceased  came  by  his  or  her  death  is  not
             admissible unless the coroner is satisfied that -

             (a) it is not possible for the maker of the  written  evidence
                  to give evidence at the inquest hearing at all, or  within
                  a reasonable time;

             (b) there is a good and sufficient reason why the maker of the
                  written evidence should not attend the inquest hearing;

             (c) there is a good and sufficient reason to believe that  the
                  maker of the written evidence will not attend the  inquest
                  hearing; or

             (d) the written  evidence  (including  evidence  in  admission
                  form) is unlikely to be disputed."

38. By virtue of paragraph 1(1)(a) of Schedule 5 to  the  Criminal  Justice
    Act 2009, a coroner in England and Wales has power to compel witnesses,
    who  are  within  that  jurisdiction.   As  for   those   outside   the
    jurisdiction, the Divisional Court in R (Shafi) v HM Senior Coroner for
    East London [2015] EWHC 2106 said:-

         "There is only so much that a coroner can  do  to  obtain  evidence
         from a foreign state, however friendly.  The coroner has  no  power
         to investigate overseas, send  investigators  overseas  or  require
         police to investigate overseas.  Nor can  the  coroner  compel  the
         disclosure of documentation from the  overseas  country  or  compel
         witnesses from the country to attend to give evidence."  (paragraph
         26)

39. Paragraph 7(1) of Schedule 5 to the 2009 Act provides that if,  at  the
    conclusion of the inquest, evidence has been heard which gives rise  to
    a concern that circumstances creating  a  risk  of  other  deaths  will
    occur, or will continue to exist, in the future, and if a coroner is of
    the opinion that action should be taken to address those circumstances,
    then the coroner must make a  report  to  the  person  responsible  for
    addressing that risk.  Such reports are made under regulation 28 of the
    Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013.  They are known in practice
    as "Prevention of future deaths" reports.  Such a report  may  be  made
    irrespective of whether there has been a critical narrative verdict  at
    the inquest.

40. In the Chief Coroner's Guidance No 22  (Pre-inquest  Review  Hearings),
    guidance is given on the operation of rule 6 of the 2013  Rules.   Pre-
    inquest review  hearings  (PIRs)  are  to  be  held  "in  more  complex
    investigations where there is a need for issues to be  aired  prior  to
    the inquest and which cannot easily be dealt with by  email".   Amongst
    the agenda items listed in paragraph 7 are: "Whether Article 2 engaged"
    and "Provisional list of witnesses".  Details of a PIR are published in
    advance on the coroner's or local authority's website.  No evidence  is
    called at a PIR and no witness should be asked or required  to  attend.
    A coroner should take care not to appear to be expressing a view  about
    any aspect of the evidence which is the subject of a  decision  at  the
    inquest.

41. The  Chief  Coroner's  Guidance  No  17  (Conclusions:  Short-form  and
    narrative) provides that the conclusion in an Article 2 case may be  in
    short form or narrative form, or a combination of the two.  A narrative
    conclusion is frequently required in order to  satisfy  the  procedural
    requirement of Article 2, including a conclusion on the events  leading
    up to the death or on relevant procedures connected with the  death:  R
    (Middleton) v HM  Coroner  for  West  Somerset  [2004]  2  AC  182.   A
    conclusion in an Article 2 case may be "a judgemental conclusion  of  a
    factual nature ... directly relating to  the  circumstances  of  death"
    (Middleton at [37]).  Permitted judgemental words include "inadequate",
    "inappropriate",     "insufficient",      "lacking",      "unsuitable",
    "unsatisfactory", and "failure".




G. THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S POLICIES

(a) Policy in force at the time of OO's death

42. At the time of OO's death, the relevant policy of  the  respondent  was
    contained in the Detention Services Order 08/2014: Death  in  detention
    (June 2016/version 2.0).  The  DSO  provides  guidance  for  all  staff
    operating in Immigration Removal Centres and  related  premises,  about
    their responsibilities if a detainee dies in Home Office detention,  or
    under escort.  Paragraph 2  states  that  supply  centre  managers  are
    responsible for developing,  implementing  and  maintaining  their  own
    local contingency plans and protocols for handling the aftermath  of  a
    death in detention.  Plans should be renewed annually or in  the  event
    of a death.  Once a death has been confirmed, the centre supplier  must
    immediately report the death to the Home Office.  Paragraph 7 reads  as
    follows:-

         "7.      The suppliers' actions are to include but not  be  limited
             to:

             .   Acting as the first person on  scene  summoning  help  and
                  requesting local emergency clinical assistance.

             .   Summoning an ambulance and the  police.   The  police  are
                  responsible for alerting the named  next  of  kin  of  the
                  death, as detailed in any  existing  local  Memorandum  of
                  Understanding.  All centres should ensure that they have a
                  Memorandum of Understanding in place with local police.

             .   Clearing the area of other detainees as soon  as  possible
                  after the discovery of an  apparent  death,  giving  equal
                  consideration  to   the   safety   of   others   and   the
                  responsibility to preserve all evidence at the scene.

             .    Reporting  immediately  the  confirmed   death   to   the
                  Independent Monitoring Board (IMB).

             .   Noting the information required by the Home Office  Family
                  Liaison  Officer  (FLO)  network  -  this  should  include
                  ensuring that the next of kin  details  are  available  or
                  that these are sought if not already in possession.

             .   Recording the details of any witnesses to  assist  in  any
                  investigation.

             .   Communicating the death  to  other  detainees  within  the
                  centre, both by talking to them  and  in  the  form  of  a
                  notice, which also directs the  detainees  to  sources  of
                  support available in  the  centre  (see  paragraphs  31-34
                  below).

             .    Reviewing  the  Room  Sharing  Risk  Assessment  of   the
                  roommate(s) of the deceased, where applicable.

             .    Ensuring  all  open  Assessment  Care  in  Detention  and
                  Teamwork (ACDT) documents are reviewed effectively.

             .   Inviting the relevant faith chaplain or  religious  leader
                  to administer official  rites,  prayers  or  other  ritual
                  observation.

             .   Ensuring the deceased's personal belongings and any  other
                  property is immediately sealed and secured  safely,  after
                  the police have attended and released the scene. "

43. Beginning at paragraph  10,  the  DSO  deals  with  the  Home  Office's
    responsibilities and actions.  The relevant duty director is to  inform
    by email the persons listed in paragraph 13 of the  death,  citing  the
    most immediate facts and confirming  that  a  submission  will  follow.
    Those listed include the private office of the relevant  minister,  the
    PPO and HM Chief Inspector of Prisons.

44. The issue of support for staff  and  detainees  is  specifically  dealt
    with:-

         "31.     Centre suppliers are reminded  that  staff  and  detainees
             affected by a death in detention may require  support  at  any
             time throughout the  investigation  process.   Suppliers  must
             ensure that they have procedures  in  place  to  support  both
             staff and those who are detained  appropriately,  for  example
             the opportunity for face to  face  meetings,  chaplaincy  team
             support, healthcare team support,  Samaritans  or  bereavement
             help lines.

         32.      Centre suppliers must ensure that a death is  communicated
             to other detainees in the centre,  both  verbally  and  via  a
             notice placed around the  centre,  and  that  individuals  are
             signposted to the welfare office (or designated support  lead)
             to access appropriate support. "

45. Paragraph 40 of the DSO states that "As  soon  as  possible  after  the
    death, all documentation must be gathered together and securely  locked
    in a cabinet with signed  access  only".   The  documentation  includes
    "Case work/Home Office file, [which]  is  to  be  requested  by  onsite
    immigration team from the case working department  in  anticipation  of
    the Prison and Probations Ombudsman's  (PPO)  investigation".   Another
    specified  form  of  documentation  comprises  "Incident  reports   and
    Security Information Reports ... involving the detainee".

46. Paragraphs 41 to 52 comprise what may be described as  a  hierarchy  of
    investigations following a death in detention.  Paragraphs  41  and  42
    concern the police investigation.  This "will  have  primacy  over  all
    other investigations".  Reference is made to a national  memorandum  of
    understanding with the PPO as to how an investigation will proceed when
    there may be evidence of crime.  Centre supplier staff and onsite  Home
    Office personnel "must all comply with the police investigation in  any
    way they can  including  attending  interviews  and  providing  witness
    statements if requested".

47. Paragraphs 44 to 50 concern the  investigation  by  the  PPO.   She  is
    responsible for investigating all deaths in Immigration Removal Centres
    throughout the United  Kingdom.   The  Home  Office  Duty  Director  is
    required  to  notify  the  PPO  of  all  deaths,  using   a   specified
    notification form.  As with the police, all centre staff,  Home  Office
    personnel, etc. must  comply  with  the  PPO  investigation,  including
    attending interviews and providing  witness  statements  if  requested.
    During the course of the PPO's investigation, "copies of all  paperwork
    relating to the deceased including medical reports, documents, incident
    reports and case files will be required.  It is imperative  that  these
    are made available to the PPO  as  and  when  requested".   After  each
    investigation "the PPO  writes  a  report  which  is  shared  with  the
    coroner, the Home Office and the family of the deceased  prior  to  the
    inquest".

48. Paragraphs 51 and 52 deal with coroner's inquests,  which  as  we  have
    seen are held for all deaths in detention.

         "An inquest is usually opened soon after a death to record that  it
         has  occurred.   It  will  then  be  adjourned  until   all   other
         investigations have been completed (e.g. by the police and the PPO)
         and any inquiries instigated by the coroner  have  been  completed.
         The inquest will be resumed and concluded  as  soon  as  any  other
         investigations are completed."  (paragraph 51)

49. The DSO concludes by stating that a "prevention of future deaths report
    will be issued by a coroner if it is found that there are lessons to be
    learned".  Organisations in receipt of such a report  are  required  to
    respond in writing to the  coroner  within  56  days  of  the  report's
    receipt.

(b) The present policy

50. The present policy is the Detention Services Order  08/2014:  Death  in
    Immigration Detention (August 2020). It is likely that the catalyst for
    the August 2020 changes was the inquest in  2019  in  Lincolnshire,  to
    which we refer in paragraph 58 below.  For our purposes,  the  relevant
    changes, compared with the June 2016 version, are as follows.

51.   What was previously paragraph 32 is now  paragraph  43,  expanded  as
    shown in bold type:-

         "43.     Centre suppliers must ensure that a death is  communicated
             to other detained individuals in the centre, both verbally and
             via a notice placed around the centre,  and  that  individuals
             are signposted to the welfare office  (or  designated  support
             lead) to access appropriate support.   It  is  important  that
             anyone who shared a room, or was a friend of the  bereaved  is
             told face to face and not via a notice,  perhaps  just  before
             other individuals are informed.  The notice communicating  the
             death will include the right of all individuals  to  speak  to
             the Police and/or PPO investigator to make a witness statement
             in relation to any information they have which may be relevant
             to the deceased's death."

52. Secondly, what was paragraph 43 is now paragraph 60, expanded as  shown
    in bold type:

         "60.  Centre supplier staff and all onsite Home Office  staff  must
         comply with the police investigation in any way they can, including
         attending interviews, providing witness statements if requested and
         making available names of  any  detained  individuals  who  may  be
         potential  witnesses/have  relevant  information  relating  to  the
         death."



53. Thirdly, what was paragraph 48 is now paragraph 65, expanded  as  shown
    in bold type:-

         "65.     All centre staff (supplier, Home Office,  healthcare  etc)
             must comply with the  PPO  investigation.   This  may  include
             attending  interviews,   providing   witness   statements   if
             requested and making available names of  any  individuals  who
             may   be   potential   witnesses/have   potentially   relevant
             information relating to the death."

54. Finally, what was paragraph 51, dealing with coroner's inquests, is now
    paragraph 68, expanded as shown in bold type:-

         "68.     In  England,  Wales  and  Northern  Ireland,  a  coroner's
             inquest is held for all deaths in detention.   An  inquest  is
             usually opened soon after  a  death  to  record  that  it  has
             occurred.   It  will  then  be  adjourned  until   any   other
             investigations have been completed (e.g. by the police and the
             PPO) and any inquiries instigated by  the  coroner  have  been
             completed.  The inquest will be resumed and concluded as  soon
             as any other  investigations  are  completed.   Staff  may  be
             required to give evidence at an inquest and the support should
             be made available to them in such circumstances."

(c) Proposed changes

55. The respondent is currently considering further changes to her  policy.
    Frances Hardy, Head of Risk  and  Assurance,  Immigration  Enforcement,
    states that, following  the  coroner's  inquest  hearing,  there  is  a
    proposal to amend paragraph 60 of the August 2020 DSO,  by  adding  the
    words shown in italic bold type:

         "60.     Centre supplier staff and all  onsite  Home  Office  staff
             must comply with the police investigation in any way they can,
             including attending interviews, providing  witness  statements
             if requested  and  making  available  names  of  any  detained
             individuals who may be  potential  witnesses/have  potentially
             relevant information relating to the death.  It  is  important
             that we are able to identify any staff or detained individuals
             who may be potential  witnesses  or  have  potential  relevant
             information relating to the death and the  checklist  attached
             at Annex XX should be used for these purposes."

56. The proposed checklist provides for details to be given  of  the  staff
    involved, and other staff on the scene,  together  with  command  suite
    staff.  So far as residents are concerned, there  are  three  headings:
    residents who witnessed the incident;  other  residents  involved;  and
    other residents with possible  knowledge  of  circumstances  of  death.
    Together with the name of the relevant person, each category requires a
    reason to be supplied.  For residents who witnessed  the  incident,  an
    example of a reason is given as "responded  to  incident".   For  other
    residents involved, an example of a reason is "entered scene, in area".
     For those other residents with possible knowledge of the circumstances
    of death, an example of a reason  is  "shared  room,  known  associate,
    claims to have relevant information".

57. Following the death in February 2021  of  a  detainee  at  Morton  Hall
    Immigration Removal Centre in Lincolnshire, Mr Thomann informed us that
    the  draft  checklist  is  being  trialled  in  connection  with   that
    unfortunate incident.




H. THE DEATH OF CARLINGTON SPENCER

58. Mention of Morton Hall brings us to a separate but  related  evidential
    strand, which emerged late in the proceedings.  It concerns the earlier
    death in detention at Morton  Hall  of  Mr  Carlington  Spencer,  whose
    inquest was held in 2019.  An application Ms Naik to file a  letter  of
    27 August 2020 from the Senior Coroner of the County of Lincolnshire to
    the Secretary of State for the Home Office was made on the first day of
    the hearing.  It arose because the Carlington Spencer inquest had  been
    mentioned in  Mr  Thomann's  skeleton  argument.   In  compliance  with
    directions made at the hearing, Ms Hardy has filed a witness  statement
    in which she regrets that the coroner's letter of  27  August  was  not
    referred to in her earlier witness statement.  She had  overlooked  the
    need to draw the letter to the  Tribunal's  attention  and  apologises.
    She also exhibited other letters written by the coroner  to  the  Legal
    Aid Agency and the Chief Constable of Lincolnshire Police,  dealing  in
    whole or in part with  the  death  of  Carlington  Spencer.   She  also
    exhibits the reply dated 25 January 2021 to the coroner's letter.   The
    reply was from Chris Philp MP, Minister for Immigration Compliance  and
    the Courts.

59. In all the circumstances, we  consider  it  appropriate  to  admit  the
    letter of 27  August  2020  and  the  letters  annexed  to  Ms  Hardy's
    statement.  It is plainly expedient, given the nature  of  the  present
    application for judicial review,  that  the  Upper  Tribunal  can  have
    regard to the issue of the death in immigration detention of Carlington
    Spencer, since it is relevant to whether the respondent's policies  are
    legally adequate.

60. We accept Ms Hardy's apology for her earlier  oversight  regarding  the
    correspondence.  In their submission of 18 March 2021, counsel for  the
    applicant urge us find that the oversight amounted to a serious  breach
    of the respondent's duty of candour and to make a declaration  to  that
    effect. Whilst there regrettably has been a breach of  that  duty,  its
    gravity is tempered by the fact that the case of Mr Carlington  Spencer
    was raised by the respondent, in Mr  Thomann's  skeleton  argument.  We
    nevertheless agree that it should not have  been  necessary  for  those
    acting for the applicant to have to procure a  copy  of  the  coroner's
    letter. This is a matter that may sound in costs.

61. The letter from the Senior Coroner to the Secretary of State enclosed a
    copy of the coroner's regulation 28 report to  prevent  future  deaths,
    following the outcome of the Carlington Spencer inquest.

62. The letter continues as follows:-

         "This was a case  where  I  was  compelled  to  issue  two  witness
         summonses for the attendance at inquest of two former  Morton  Hall
         IRC detainees.  These witnesses had not made formal  statements  to
         the police but I accepted submissions from lawyers acting on behalf
         of the deceased  that  they  were  important  and  relevant  direct
         witnesses to the events within the scope of the inquest.

         The case raises the following matters of concern:

         1. As part of the internal Morton Hall IRC investigation and police
             investigation, the importance of these detainees  as  material
             witnesses to a potential inquest was not appreciated;

         2. No formal, declared  statements  were  obtained  timeously  from
             these witnesses;

         3. As part of the process of deportation, two detainees were on the
             point of being physically deported in circumstances where  the
             Home Office either was not aware, or chose to ignore the  fact
             that these detainees were important witnesses required to give
             evidence at a forthcoming inquest hearing;

         I make it clear that these concerns  are  in  no  way  designed  to
         fetter or control the exercise of your responsibilities  to  deport
         individuals from the jurisdiction.  Rather, it  is  an  attempt  to
         bring to your attention an important matter which needs to be taken
         into account when considering whether a detainee ought, properly to
         be deported.

         The two witnesses gave important and critical evidence commensurate
         to their anticipated values.

         It is vital for on-going public confidence in the coronial  process
         that at inquest a coroner or interested person to  the  proceedings
         has the ability to call and receive the best evidence."

63. The letter in reply from the Minister for  Immigration  Compliance  and
    the Courts is dated 25 January 2021.  For our  purposes,  the  relevant
    passages are as follows:-

         "With regards to the issues raised in your  letter,  you  mentioned
         that you had issued witness summonses for attendance at the inquest
         of two former Morton Hall IRC residents to  give  key  evidence  in
         relation to the death of Mr Spencer.  You expressed  concerns  that
         as part of the internal Morton Hall IRC  investigation  and  police
         investigation into Mr Spencer's  death,  the  importance  of  these
         individuals   as   material   witnesses   was   not    appreciated;
         specifically, that no formal statements had been obtained from  the
         witnesses;  and  that  removal  processes  for  these   individuals
         continued, despite being important  witnesses  in  the  forthcoming
         inquest.

         The Home Office has recently taken action on these matters,  having
         published updated guidance  for  staff  and  service  providers  on
         responsibilities when dealing with a death in immigration detention
         facility, in hospital or under escort.  This guidance can be  found
         in Detention Services Order 08/2014 "handling a death in detention"
         ...

         The updated guidance makes it clear that centre  service  providers
         must  ensure  that  a  death  is  communicated  to  other  detained
         individuals in the centre, both verbally and via  a  notice  placed
         around the centre, and  that  individuals  are  signposted  to  the
         welfare  office  (or  designated  support)  to  access  appropriate
         support.  The notice communicating the death will include the right
         of all individuals to  speak  to  the  Police  and/or  Prisons  and
         Probation Ombudsman (PPO) investigator to make a witness  statement
         in relation to any information they have which may be  relevant  to
         the deceased person's  death.   Following  a  death  in  detention,
         centre service providers and all  onsite  Home  Office  staff  must
         comply with the Police and/or PPO investigation  in  any  way  they
         can, including attending interviews, providing  witness  statements
         if requested  and  making  available  the  names  of  any  detained
         individuals who may be potential  witnesses  and  have  potentially
         relevant information relating to an individual's death.

         Additionally, I can also confirm that the Home Office are reviewing
         current guidance in relation to the enforcement action (such as the
         deportation or removal) of individuals who have witnessed the death
         in detention and may be required to  give  evidence  in  person  at
         inquest.  We will write to you further on this matter following the
         outcome of this review."



I. DISCUSSION

(a) The nature of the respondent's duty

64. In considering the Strasbourg caselaw as to the extent of the Article 2
    procedural duty to investigate a suspicious death, it is  important  to
    bear in mind that the ECtHR is  concerned  with  the  entirety  of  the
    process, beginning with the initial steps to secure evidence and ending
    with the actual investigation or trial.  Although the investigation  or
    trial must be conducted with the requisite degree of  independence,  it
    by no means follows that the duty to  secure  evidence  cannot  involve
    those such as the respondent and her service providers, who will not be
    conducting the subsequent independent investigations.  On the contrary,
    given that, in the  context  of  a  death  in  detention,  the  service
    providers and the relevant officials of the respondent at the detention
    centre will inevitably be the first on the  scene,  they  clearly  must
    take the initial steps to secure evidence.  This is so, irrespective of
    the fact that, in order of likely appearance,  the  police,  the  PPO's
    investigators and the coroner will also become actively involved.

65. Furthermore, it is important to acknowledge that, both in Da Silva  and
    Edwards, the ECtHR has been at pains to state  that  the  steps  to  be
    taken are "reasonable" ones.  What is reasonable will depend, not  only
    on the circumstances of the death but also the nature  and  purpose  of
    the detention facility, such as whether it is holding  individuals  who
    face removal by the respondent from the United Kingdom, in pursuance of
    her  functions,  conferred  by  Parliament,  of  enforcing  immigration
    controls.

66. On several occasions in her  written  and  oral  submissions,  Ms  Naik
    sought  to  categorise  the  respondent's  stance  as  being  that  the
    respondent's view of what is reasonable in this area is susceptible  to
    review only on Wednesbury  grounds.   We  do  not  consider  that  this
    criticism is valid.  Since we are in the area of fundamental rights, it
    is  trite  law  that  the  Tribunal  must  determine  whether,  in  the
    particular circumstances, the steps  the  respondent  takes  to  secure
    evidence are objectively reasonable, albeit having due  regard  to  the
    respondent's overall statutory responsibilities.  We did  not  take  Mr
    Thomann to be contending otherwise.

67. In the present case,  the  respondent  accepts  that  whether  she  has
    complied  with  her  Article  2  procedural  obligations  falls  to  be
    determined by reference to (i) the particular circumstances surrounding
    the death of OO and the decision to remove the applicant; and (ii)  the
    general  compatibility  of  the  respondent's  policies  on  death   in
    detention with her Article 2 obligations.

68.  So far as the latter is concerned, Ms Naik relied upon  the  judgments
    of the Court of Appeal in R (FB) (Afghanistan) and Another v  Secretary
    of State for the Home Department [2020] EWCA Civ 1338.  The  court  was
    there  concerned  with  the  respondent's  so-called  "removal  window"
    policy.  The court held  that  the  policy  was  unlawful  because  "an
    irregular migrant who applies for deferral [of the removal window]  and
    is refused within the removal window - as will  almost  always  be  the
    case - will be at immediate risk of  removal,  without  having  had  an
    opportunity of challenging the refusal in a claim for  judicial  review
    ... before a court  or  tribunal"  (Hickinbottom  LJ,  paragraph  142).
    Consequently, at that point there was "a real risk of denial of  access
    to justice" (ibid).  Ms Naik urged us to follow the analysis adopted by
    Hickinbottom LJ in RB, rather than the approach adopted by the Court of
    Appeal in R (BF) Eritrea)) v Secretary of State for the Home Department
    [2019]  EWCA  Civ  872.   There,  the  court  was  concerned  with  the
    lawfulness of the respondent's policy on the detention of young people,
    which gave guidance on how to assess whether such a  young  person  was
    under 18.  At paragraph 63, Underhill LJ held that:-

         "The correct approach in the circumstances of the present case  is,
         straightforwardly, that the policy/guidance contained in  paragraph
         55.3.9.1 of the EIG and the relevant parts of "Assessing Age"  will
         be unlawful, if but only if, the way that they are framed creates a
         real risk of a more than minimal number of children being detained.
          I should emphasise, however, that the policy should not be held to
         be unlawful only because there are liable, as in any  system  which
         necessarily depends on the exercise of subjective judgment,  to  be
         particular "aberrant" decisions - that is, individual  mistakes  or
         misjudgements made in the pursuit of a proper policy.  The issue is
         whether the terms of the policy  themselves  create  a  risk  which
         could be avoided if they were better formulated."

69. We see no conflict between FB and BF.  In FB, it was  inherent  in  the
    removal window policy that persons could face removal before  they  had
    had an opportunity to obtain legal advice on an adverse  decision  made
    by the respondent on their latest submissions. They would be at risk of
    immediate removal because such a decision could be reached  during  the
    period of the removal window.   In  BF,  by  contrast,  the  policy  in
    question was concerned with the making of an evaluative  assessment  as
    to an individual's age.  No policy which seeks to guide the  making  of
    such an assessment can guarantee that incorrect decisions will never be
    made, unless  the  policy  is  framed  in  such  a  way  as  unduly  to
    circumscribe, or even eliminate, its  usefulness  (e.g.  by  specifying
    that only those considered to be over the age of 50 should be  regarded
    as adults in age-disputed cases).

70. In the present case, the policy with which we are concerned is far more
    akin to the evaluative policy considered  in  BF  than  it  is  to  the
    removal window policy considered in FB.  No policy designed  to  comply
    with the Article 2 procedural duty  of  taking  "reasonable  steps"  to
    secure evidence, following a death in  detention,  can  guarantee  that
    potentially relevant evidence will always be secured and made available
    to  the  investigating  body  or  bodies.   Although  the  respondent's
    responsibilities for  immigration  control  cannot  dilute  what  would
    otherwise  be  her  Article  2  procedural   obligations,   they   must
    nevertheless inform the tribunal  or  court's  assessment  of  what  is
    reasonable in the context of the investigation of a death occurring  in
    immigration detention. This point can be seen from the applications for
    interim relief made by Duncan Lewis Solicitors  following  OO's  death,
    where the claim that no one in detention  in  the  relevant  facilities
    could be removed was rejected by the Court of Appeal.

71. The fact that, in this general area, the tribunal or court  is  engaged
    in an  assessment  of  whether  an  admitted  risk  is  acceptable  was
    expressly made in the judgments of the Court of Appeal in R  (Delezuch)
    and Others v Chief Constable of Leicestershire Constabulary and  Others
    [2014]  EWCA  Civ  1635.   In  that  case,  the  issue  was  about  the
    compatibility  or  otherwise  of  policies   concerning   post-incident
    management of investigations into deaths that follow the use  of  force
    by police officers.  At paragraph 54, Richards LJ said:-

         "54.     It should be stressed that  the  principle  on  which  the
             claimants rely is that a policy is unlawful if it  creates  an
             unacceptable risk that individual decisions or action taken in
             application of the policy will be unlawful  -  in  this  case,
             that investigations carried out in accordance  with  the  2014
             guidance will be in breach of the procedural  requirements  of
             article 2.  The principle is not that any risk of an  unlawful
             outcome must be avoided."

(b) The role of the coroner

72. In the present case, the applicant submits that the only lawful  policy
    which the respondent can adopt in relation  to  deaths  in  immigration
    detention is one in which the coroner plays a  pivotal  role.  Ms  Naik
    accepts that where a death occurs in detention, it does not follow that
    all individuals who have any  evidence  to  give  must  remain  in  the
    jurisdiction  until  the  conclusion  of  the  inquest.   She  submits,
    however, that the  respondent  not  only  must  identify  the  pool  of
    material witnesses, secure their evidence, identity and whereabouts and
    provide all this to the responsible investigating authorities, but also
    that she must permit the coroner to reach  a  conclusion  as  to  which
    witnesses are required and by  what  means  their  evidence  should  be
    provided.  Until then, no removal of anyone in the  pool  is  possible.
    Ms Naik says it is for the coroner alone to reach a  conclusion  as  to
    whether evidence by video-link, from abroad would be a satisfactory way
    of enabling an individual to give evidence to the jury at the  inquest.



73. For the respondent, Mr Thomann submits that such a fixed role  for  the
    coroner in these cases is neither necessary nor appropriate.  We  agree
    with Mr Thomann on this issue.  To insist that the coroner, in  effect,
    approves of the removal of any individual who may  have  evidence  that
    might fall  to  be  considered  at  an  inquest  goes  beyond  what  is
    reasonable in order to comply with the Article 2  procedural  duty,  as
    articulated by the ECtHR and interpreted by the  domestic  courts.   We
    find that the irreducible minimum obligations of the respondent in this
    area are:

         (a) to take immediate steps to ascertain whether any  detainee  has
         evidence to give regarding the death in detention;

         (b) to record, or facilitate the recording of, a statement of  such
         evidence;

         (c) to determine whether the individual is willing to give evidence
         at the inquest;

         (d) to record relevant contact details of the individual, including
         in the country of proposed removal; and

          (e) to  consider  the  practicability  of  the  individual  giving
         evidence at the inquest either  (i)  by  returning  to  the  United
         Kingdom for that purpose or (ii) by giving  evidence  by  means  of
         video-link.

74. The actual implementation of these obligations may, of course,  involve
    liaison with other relevant actors, such as the police, the PPO and the
    coroner.  Depending on the circumstances, the views of the coroner  may
    well need to be sought: for example, where the individual is  the  sole
    eyewitness  to  the  death  and  their  evidence  is   likely   to   be
    controversial.  The rigidity of the model proposed  by  the  applicant,
    however, goes far beyond what is reasonable.  It  would  put  an  undue
    fetter on the ability of the  respondent  to  discharge  her  statutory
    functions in the immigration field.  We agree with Mr Thomann  that  it
    would be open to abuse by those opportunistically  seeking  to  benefit
    from a death by prolonging their stay in the United Kingdom.  There  is
    no evidence that coroners would regard such a system as  desirable  or,
    indeed, practicable from their perspective. The letter from the  Senior
    Coroner for Lincolnshire cannot be prayed in aid in this regard. On the
    contrary, he was at pains to  recognise  the  respondent's  immigration
    functions and to  emphasise  he  was  not  suggesting  fettering  them.
    Provided that the respondent's policy mandates appropriate action to be
    taken to identify and secure the  evidence,  as  described  above,  the
    respondent must be able to exercise her judgment in deciding what, in a
    particular case, constitutes a reasonable response, following  a  death
    in detention. As Mr Thomann pointed out, the respondent will  still  be
    susceptible to legal challenge in any individual case.

75. The applicant made much of the fact that the coroner cannot compel  the
    attendance of witnesses outside  (in  this  case)  England  and  Wales.
    Whilst the lack of compellability was, as we have  seen,  an  important
    matter in Edwards, we agree with Mr Thomann that it cannot properly  be
    suggested that  guaranteeing  the  compellability  of  each  and  every
    potential witness regarding a death in detention is a sine qua  non  of
    an Article 2-compliant investigation.   As  Mr  Thomann  submits,  that
    suggestion can be tested by reference to a witness who does not wish to
    remain in the United Kingdom.  If  a  foreign  visitor  to  the  United
    Kingdom witnesses an unnatural fatality here  and  provides  a  written
    statement, but then understandably wishes to return home, it cannot  be
    the case that Article 2 requires the United  Kingdom  to  prevent  them
    from doing so. We accept,  of  course,  that  the  respondent  bears  a
    particular responsibility, where the death occurs  in  her  immigration
    detention facility. Nevertheless, just as it would be  unreasonable  to
    prevent the visitor from leaving the jurisdiction of the  part  of  the
    United Kingdom in  which  the  death  occurred,  despite  the  possible
    consequences arising from the coroner's inability to compel the visitor
    to attend the ensuing inquest, so the assessment of what is  reasonable
    (that is to say, what Article 2 requires) needs to be made by reference
    to the fact that those in immigration detention are there in order that
    the respondent can  remove  them  from  the  United  Kingdom.  Lack  of
    compellability is, thus, a factor  that  must  be  considered,  in  the
    round, in deciding whether and, if so, how a person's potential  status
    a witness at an  inquest  impacts  upon  the  respondent's  immigration
    functions, on the facts of a particular case. For example, if a  person
    has expressed willingness to return to the United Kingdom, if requested
    to do so by the coroner, this factor may be such as, overall,  to  make
    it reasonable in terms of Article 2 for the respondent to remove them.

76. Ms Naik submits that the coroner is unlikely to regard  video  evidence
    given to a jury as a satisfactory alternative to  live  evidence.   She
    also points to the findings of the Supreme Court  in  relation  to  the
    Article 8 ECHR procedural duty in the case of Kiarie v Byndloss  [2017]
    UKSC 42.  We do not consider the comparison with Kiarie to be apt.   In
    that case, the individual facing removal was the actual appellant in an
    appeal involving his human rights.  If outside the United  Kingdom,  he
    or she might face, amongst other things, difficulties  in  instructing,
    and being advised by, legal representatives; and in being  the  subject
    of any meaningful report by doctors or social workers.  None of that is
    relevant here.  So far as technology is  concerned,  matters  have,  of
    course, moved on since the point under  consideration  by  the  Supreme
    Court in Kiarie. This is  true  of  all  jurisdictions,  including  the
    coronial. The Lord Chief Justice was at pains to underscore  the  point
    at paragraph 198 of FB.  Again, in the circumstances  of  a  particular
    case, the respondent may need to pay particular  attention  to  whether
    video evidence from abroad would be  satisfactory.   This  may  require
    liaising with the coroner before  removal  is  effected.   The  general
    proposition  that  evidence  given  by   video   is   inherently   less
    satisfactory than evidence given by a person physically present in  the
    courtroom, even if  correct,  is  not,  however,  a  justification  for
    requiring coroners to  play  the  fixed  role  urged  on  them  by  the
    applicant.

(c) Defects in the respondent's policies

77. Having made these findings, we turn to address the specific policies of
    the respondent.  As we have seen,  at  the  time  of  OO's  death,  the
    relevant policy was the DSO 08/2014, Version 2.0 of June  2016.   There
    is no doubt that the policy contained in the June 2016 document created
    an unacceptable risk that the respondent would fail to comply with  her
    Article 2 procedural duties of securing relevant evidence, following  a
    death in immigration detention.  The focus of the previous DSO was upon
    staff; and the evidence of staff.  So far as detainees were  concerned,
    the DSO dealt merely with their welfare  needs  when  it  also  needed,
    crucially, to address the question of the evidence that  detainees  may
    have about the death.

78. The inadequacy of the previous DSO can, we consider, be seen  from  the
    description we have given earlier about  the  events  surrounding  OO's
    death on 11 September 2019.  This is not a matter of failures occurring
    despite  the  existence  of  a  reasonable  policy.   It  is,   rather,
    illustrative of the deficiencies of the policy.  The  notice  delivered
    to detainees, set out  at  paragraph  8  above,  followed  the  DSO  in
    focusing upon their welfare needs without including  a  message  urging
    detainees to come forward if they had relevant evidence to  give.   The
    previous DSO also lacked any exhortation to staff to  be  proactive  in
    seeking  such  evidence.   In  the  circumstances,  it   was   entirely
    unsurprising that Mr Ullah, who occupied the room next to OO,  was  not
    interviewed; that his whereabouts became unknown.

79. For these reasons, we conclude that the  respondent's  decision  of  16
    September 2019 to remove the applicant to Nigeria on 17 September  2019
    was unlawful, in that, at that point, the  respondent  failed  to  take
    reasonable steps to secure  the  applicant's  evidence  concerning  the
    death of OO (and to take the other minimum steps described in paragraph
    73 above) contrary to her Article 2 procedural obligations.

80. It is plain that the August 2020 DSO is a  marked  improvement  on  its
    predecessor.  The new words in what is now paragraph 43  highlight  the
    right of detainees to speak to the police and/or  PPO  investigator  to
    make a witness statement in relation to any information they have which
    may be relevant to the deceased's death.  That is to be communicated in
    the notice given to detainees.  Paragraph 60  requires  staff  to  make
    available names of detainees who may be  potential  witnesses  or  have
    potentially relevant information.  Paragraph 65 imposes  on  staff  the
    obligation to comply with a PPO investigation, making  available  names
    of  any  individuals  who  may  be  potential  witnesses  or  who  have
    potentially relevant information.

81. Ms Naik submits that these amendments are inadequate to  eliminate  the
    real risk of a breach of Article 2 in its procedural  form.   She  says
    that the policy does not require staff to be proactive  in  identifying
    those who may have relevant evidence to  give.   In  essence,  the  DSO
    merely relies upon detainees coming forward of their own accord.

82. On this issue, we agree with Ms Naik.  Whilst it would be inappropriate
    to expect centre staff to usurp the roles of the police and the PPO, as
    we have said at paragraph 64 above,  they  have  a  vital  function  to
    perform  in  identifying  those  detainees  who,  because  of  physical
    proximity to the deceased or other known associations,  are  likely  to
    have relevant information, whether or not  they  have  chosen  to  come
    forward of their own accord.  In our view, the current policy fails  to
    address this matter and is, therefore, not compliant with Article 2  in
    its procedural form.

83. It will be recalled that a further revision to the DSO is proposed.  Ms
    Hardy has stated that paragraph  60  will  contain  the  words  "It  is
    important  that  we  are  able  to  identify  any  staff  or   detained
    individuals who may be potential witnesses or have potentially relevant
    information relating to the death and the checklist attached  at  Annex
    XX should be used for these purposes".  The checklist is, in our  view,
    significant, in that it requires names  of  residents  to  be  entered,
    together with reasons why  they  may  have  relevant  evidence.   Those
    reasons are, as we have seen, objectively couched.  They require  names
    to be given where staff are aware of a relevant reason, whether or  not
    the detainee has come forward.  Thus, for example, a detainee who is  a
    "known associate" of the deceased must feature  on  the  checklist,  as
    must those who "responded to incident" or "entered scene".

84. It is emphatically not the place of the Tribunal to prescribe the final
    form of paragraph 60 and any checklist.  Nor would  it  be  appropriate
    for us to state categorically that the adoption of the  words  provided
    by Ms Hardy and the checklist will  necessarily  result  in  a  legally
    sufficient policy document.  It will be for the  respondent  to  decide
    how, if at all, to react to what we have said.  For the purposes of the
    present proceedings, we intend to make a declaration to the effect that
    the DSO in its August 2020 form is unlawful, in that it gives rise to a
    real risk of an Article 2 procedural breach because it does not  direct
    relevant personnel actively to identify, and to take  steps  to  secure
    the evidence of, those detainees whom there is reason  to  believe  may
    have relevant information concerning the death of the person concerned.



85. Finally, the present policy framework  of  the  respondent  is  legally
    deficient in a further  important  respect.   The  respondent  candidly
    admits that there is, at present,  nothing  in  her  policy  concerning
    removals; namely Judicial Reviews and Injunctions -  Version  20.0  (10
    October 2019), which guides her immigration officials to act compatibly
    with Article 2 in its procedural form, when making decisions as to  the
    removal of an individual.  As we have  seen,  the  Senior  Coroner  for
    Lincolnshire, in his letter of 27  August  2020  to  the  Secretary  of
    State, raised as a particular point of concern that "two detainees were
    on the point of being physically deported in  circumstances  where  the
    Home Office either was not aware, or chose  to  ignore  the  fact  that
    these detainees were important witnesses required to give evidence at a
    forthcoming inquest hearing".  That  chimes  dismally  with  events  at
    Gauze House, Harmondsworth, following the death of OO.

86. We  conclude  that  there  needs  to  a  policy  for  the  respondent's
    immigration officials,   who  are  charged  with  making  decisions  on
    removal, which requires those officials to  have  regard  to  the  core
    obligations described in paragraph  73  above.   Any  policy  needs  to
    provide a process, whereby the relevant immigration  official  is  made
    aware if a person scheduled for removal has been identified  by  centre
    staff and/or the respondent's  officers  at  an  immigration  detention
    facility as a person with potentially relevant information or  evidence
    to give in respect of  a  death  in  custody  in  that  facility.   The
    official must then consider the likely importance of the evidence;  the
    likely  ability  of  the  respondent  to  maintain  contact  with   the
    individual, if removed; and the likelihood of the individual being able
    to return to the United Kingdom or give  evidence  by  video-link  from
    abroad, at  the  inquest.   These  are  matters  for  the  respondent's
    officials  who  are  tasked  with  the  discharge  of  her  immigration
    functions, rather than the centre staff.

87. Accordingly, we shall declare that the absence of a policy which  deals
    with these matters means that  the  respondent  is  in  breach  of  her
    Article 2 procedural obligations in respect of  deaths  in  immigration
    detention.

88. We invite counsel to seek to agree an order that gives effect  to  this
    decision.

No anonymity direction is made.
