                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge V A Osborne, promulgated  on  20th  February  2014,  following  a
    hearing at Stoke-on-Trent on 6th February 2014.  In the  determination,
    the judge dismissed the appeal of Mr Nazakat  Hussain.   The  Appellant
    applied for, and  was  granted,  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.

The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a male, a citizen of Pakistan, who  was  born  on  5th
    June 1984.  He appealed against the decision of  the  Respondent  Entry
    Clearance Officer to refuse his application for entry clearance to join
    his wife, the Sponsor,  Mrs  Zulekha  Perveen,  a  person  present  and
    settled in the UK.

The Appellant's Claim

 3. The Appellant's claim is that she was not working at the  time  of  her
    marriage with Mr Nazakat Hussain.  After her marriage she  remained  in
    Pakistan with him for six months and then returned back to  the  UK  in
    March 2010.  By the time she returned to the UK she  was  pregnant  and
    her daughter, Aalia, was  born  on  3rd  July  2010.   She  then  began
    employment with the Asian Learning Centre in January 2012.  She and the
    Appellant kept in contact on a regular basis through telephone calls.

 4. When the Sponsor went to the Tribunal hearing before Judge V A Osborne,
    she gave evidence and confirmed the facts  relating  to  her  marriage,
    stating that she first met her  husband  when  she  attended  a  family
    wedding in Pakistan in 2007, that her husband was her first cousin, and
    "in accordance with cultural traditions a marriage was arranged between
    her and the Appellant and the marriage subsequently took place in 2009"
    (see paragraph 17).

 5. Her employment with the Asian Learning Centre  ended  when  the  centre
    closed down in February 2013.  The Sponsor had not worked since January
    2013.  She was looking for alternative employment, but she had  visited
    her husband in Pakistan, together with their daughter between April and
    July 2013.  There was photographic evidence of the visit (see paragraph
    21).

The Judge's Findings

 6. The judge was satisfied that the relationship between the Appellant and
    his wife was a genuine one and that the marriage was a  subsisting  one
    (see paragraph 25).  The main issue thereafter  before  the  judge  was
    that of "the adequacy of maintenance for the  Appellant  and  his  wife
    based upon his wife's earnings" (paragraph 26).

 7. Since the application was made on 27th June 2012 (and therefore  before
    the latest rule changes came into effect on 9th July  2013),  all  that
    the Appellant had to show was that there was  a  level  of  maintenance
    that was equivalent to the receipt of  state  benefits,  which  was  an
    income of �833.51 per month together with housing costs.

 8. There were bank statements  before  the  judge  from  January  2012  to
    February 2013 and these showed that "child tax credit continued  to  be
    paid throughout the period ..." (paragraph 29).  The judge held that,

         "This additional income does not appear to  have  been  taken  into
         account  by  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  who   determined   the
         application in the first instance nor was it  referred  to  at  the
         hearing before me, but nevertheless I am satisfied based  upon  the
         Sponsor's employment that she would  have  been  entitled  to  this
         additional income and it should have been  taken  into  account  in
         assessing the adequacy or otherwise of the maintenance"  (paragraph
         30).

 9. The judge then went on to express satisfaction with the level of income
    funds by stating that,




         "Based upon the unchallenged figures as put forward  by  the  Entry
         Clearance Officer I am  satisfied  that  as  at  the  date  of  the
         decision the Sponsor had sufficient funds to demonstrate  that  she
         had an income which exceeded the income support rates  relevant  at
         the time" (paragraph 31).

10. However, an issue was thereafter raised by the  Presenting  Officer  in
    relation to the Sponsor's employment with the  Asian  Learning  Centre,
    when attention was drawn to the Sponsor's contract  of  employment  and
    the wage slips in two small bundles (see paragraph 33).

11. The judge explained that the significance of the two sets  of  payslips
    "was that they had been produced to demonstrate  the  increase  in  the
    Sponsor's income which would have been  relevant  as  at  the  date  of
    decision" (paragraph 35).  Yet, the Presenting Officer,

         "Called into question the value of  the  second  set  of  payslips,
         firstly because one  of  them  had  been  misprinted  but  all  the
         information appearing in the wrong place.  Secondly the  difference
         between the two payslips showed the Sponsor's gross income had gone
         up from �1,000 a month to �1,080 a month but although the Sponsor's
         payslips in the first bundle showed that she was being taxed on her
         income, the second set showed that no tax was being paid.  Her name
         had been changed from Mrs Z Perveen in the  first  set  to  Miss  P
         Zulekha in the second set" (see paragraph 36).

12. The judge then went on to say that this  placed  the  Sponsor  in  some
    difficulty, and by extension  the  Appellant  also,  so  that  "in  the
    absence of a P60 or P45 there is  no  further  corroborative  evidence"
    (paragraph 38).  The judge took into account the fact that a child  had
    now been born (paragraph 42).  However, the Rules could not be met.

13. The judge thereafter gave consideration to  Article  8  but  held  that
    there was nothing to prevent the Sponsor making a choice to  live  with
    her husband in Pakistan to avoid any further disruption to their family
    life.

14. A fresh application could be  made  but  this  would  now  fall  to  be
    assessed by reference to Appendix FM and  the  Sponsor  would  have  to
    demonstrate an income of at least �22,400 to satisfy the test  set  out
    in Appendix FM for the adequacy of financial maintenance (see paragraph
    43).

Grounds of Application

15. The grounds of application state that there is a lack  of  consistency,
    and clear confusion, in the judge's initial findings  at  paragraph  31
    where he states that  "based  upon  the  unchallenged  figures  as  put
    forward by the Entry Clearance Officer I am satisfied that  as  at  the
    date of decision the Sponsor had sufficient  funds"  and  the  findings
    thereafter made from paragraph 36 onwards up until paragraph  40  which
    take issue with the wage slips in a way that suggest that the judge was
    not satisfied, thus leading to the dismissal of the appeal.

16. On 30th April 2014, permission to appeal was granted.

The Hearing

17. At the hearing  before  me,  Mr  Ikhlak,  appeared  on  behalf  of  the
    Appellant  and  placed  reliance  upon  his  Grounds  of  Appeal.    In
    particular, he drew attention to the contradiction between the findings
    at paragraph 31 and the subsequent findings made in the determination.

18. For his part, Mr Smart also placed reliance upon his Rule  24  response
    dated 20th May 2014 and accepted that there was apparent  confusion  in
    what the judge was saying at paragraph 31  and  what  was  subsequently
    found by him by looking at the wage slips.

19. Mr Smart submitted that the date of decision  was  5th  December  2012.
    The payslips were dated October  and  November  2012.   The  judge  was
    entitled to take these payslips into account even after he had made his
    statement at paragraph 31.  In taking these into account, the judge was
    entitled then to say that there were discrepancies in the payslips such
    that would lead him to take a contrary view.  This the judge  did.   It
    was now open to the Appellant to apply again under the new rules  where
    a minimum income of �18,600 would have to be shown.

20. In reply, Mr Ikhlak submitted that the judge did make  a  finding  that
    the "unchallenged figures" led him to conclude  that  the  Sponsor  had
    sufficient funds to meet the Rules,  but  failed  to  make  clear  what
    additional income he was really referring to.  There was  an  error  of
    law and I should make such a finding and then remake the decision.

Error of Law

21. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  involved
    the making of an error on a point of law (see  Section  12(1)  of  TCEA
    2007) such that I  should  set  aside  this  decision  and  remake  the
    decision.  My reasons  are  quite  simply  that  there  is  a  lack  of
    consistency between what was found by the judge at paragraph 31 on  the
    basis of "unchallenged figures"  which  showed  that  the  Sponsor  had
    sufficient funds "to demonstrate that she had an income which  exceeded
    the income support rates relevant at the time" (paragraph 31); and what
    the judge subsequently found from paragraph 35 onwards, where  he  held
    that, "the first set of payslips are misleading because they appear  to
    indicate that the Sponsor  had  been  in  employment  for  longer  than
    claimed based upon the figures given for total gross pay to date  ...."
    (paragraph 37).

Remaking the Decision

22. I have made the remade the decision on the basis of the findings of the
    original judge, the evidence before him, and the submission that I have
    heard today.  I am dismissing this appeal for the following reasons.

23. First, I accept the judge's findings that the payslips  simply  do  not
    make any sense whatsoever.  For example, it is said  that  the  Sponsor
    was employed from February 2012, and yet the first payslips only begins
    from October 2012, several months thereafter.  Furthermore, by the time
    of this hearing, I have had from Mr Ikhlak, P60s  for  2012  and  2013.
    These are at pages 9 to 10 of the latest bundle.  The P60 for 2013  (at
    page 9) shows that the Sponsor had earned �10,800.   This  is  the  one
    that she would seek to rely upon.  This is because the P60 (at page 10)
    for 2012, shows that she only earned �3,000.  Yet, even if one were  to
    look at the P60 for 2013, showing earnings of �10,800, it is  difficult
    to see how this can be an accurate document given that the  wage  slips
    show that the Sponsor earned no such sum at all.

24. I am aware that clearly, there have been returns made by the  employer,
    the Asian Language Centre, to Her Majesties Revenue &  Customs.   There
    is also a  P45  (at  page  8)  confirming  the  employment.   In  these
    circumstances, it is a bold step to disbelieve a P60 because this is  a
    document which is generated by the employer, and it  is  one  which  is
    intended to be a summary of an employee's employment record.   Yet,  it
    is a record which is  based  on  a  previous  year's  wage  slips.   An
    explanation is clearly called for as to why the P60 is  so  drastically
    inconsistent with  the  previous  year's  wage-slips.   But,  the  Asia
    Language Centre no longer exists.  At the  same  time,  the  Respondent
    authority has not been able to  show  that  the  P60  is  a  fraudulent
    document  which  has   been   forged.    The   situation   is   clearly
    unsatisfactory.  It is also unsatisfactory because the Judge (see  para
    8 above) had initially found in favour of the appellant on the basis of
    the funds available in this sponsoring wife's bank  account.   If  this
    was so, then the appellant could of course point to the availability of
    "income which exceeded the income support rates relevant at  the  time"
    (paragraph 31 of the Judge's determination).

25. Yet, ultimately, however, that finding of the Judge,  I  conclude,  was
    based on the existence of  an  employment  record  as  claimed  by  the
    appellant's sponsoring wife, which the Judge eventually  then  doubted,
    and this is why this appeal fails.  This  is  clear  from  the  Judge's
    observation that, ".... nevertheless I  am  satisfied  based  upon  the
    Sponsor's  employment  that  she  would  have  been  entitled  to  this
    additional income and  it  should  have  been  taken  into  account  in
    assessing the adequacy or otherwise of the maintenance" (paragraph 30).



26. The finding of the judge was inevitable on  the  evidence  before  him.
    The fact is that the background evidence in terms of wage slips  is  so
    much out of sync with the P60, that there is bound  to  be  a  question
    mark as to whether the Sponsor ever did work to  the  extent  that  she
    claimed to have worked,  generating  the  amount  of  income  that  she
    claimed to have  generated.  I  am  not  satisfied,  on  a  balance  of
    probabilities test, that she has been able to show this.

27. On the contrary, I find that the evidence points in the other direction
    and that there is considerable concern raised by the way in which these
    financial documents had been put together by the Asian Language Centre.
      I  come  to  this  conclusion  notwithstanding  the  absence  of   an
    investigation by the Respondent  confirming  the  P60  from  the  Asian
    Language Centre being a fraudulent document.

28. It is open to the Appellant to apply again.  If he does so, it will now
    be under the new Rules.  He will have to comply with Appendix FM.  That
    must be the natural consequence of this appeal being dismissed.

29. I have taken into account  the  application  of  Article  8  ECHR.   In
    circumstances where the Rules are meant to  strike  the  right  balance
    with respect to Article 8 in any event,  being  a  "complete  code"  as
    expressed by the Master  of  the  Rolls  in  MF  (Nigeria),  I  am  not
    satisfied that the Appellant can point to  "exceptional  circumstances"
    in the sense that the consequences of this appeal being  dismissed  are
    "unjustifiably harsh" for him.  This is because as the  judge  in  this
    determination said originally, it is open to the Sponsor to go and live
    with the Appellant, which he had already done for six months, following
    her marriage.

Decision

30. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did involve  the  making  of  a
    error of law such that it falls to be set aside.  I have set aside  the
    decision of the original judge.  I  remake  the  decision  as  follows.
    This appeal is dismissed.

31. No anonymity order is made.
