                                                                  Respondent

For the Respondent:    Mrs M O'Brien, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                       REMITTAL TO FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL

 1. First-tier Tribunal Judge David C Clapham SSC dismissed the appellant's
    appeal by decision promulgated on 8 February 2017.

 2. The case first came before the UT on 24 July 2017, following  which  an
    error of law decision was issued on 26 July 2017, which should be  read
    along with this decision.

 3. On 29 August 2017, the parties agreed that the outstanding  issues  are
    of greater scope than they had previously  thought,  in  light  of  the
    report by Dr R Fatah dated 22 August 2017, obtained by the appellant in
    light of the respondent's rule 24 reply of 21 July 2017.  Matters might
    not be  covered  by  country  guidance  as  it  stands.   They  further
    concurred that the case was apt for resolution in the FtT.

 4. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal has been set aside.   In  light
    of the foregoing, it is appropriate in terms of section 12(2)(b)(i)  of
    the 2007 Act and of Practice Statement 7.2 to remit the case to the FtT
    for a fresh hearing.

 5. The member(s) of the FtT chosen to consider the case are not to include
    Judge David C Clapham SSC.

 6. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
