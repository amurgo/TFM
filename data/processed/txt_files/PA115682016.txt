                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 (SI 2008/2698) I  make  an  anonymity  order.   Unless  the  Upper
    Tribunal or Court directs otherwise, no  report  of  these  proceedings
    shall directly or indirectly identify the  Appellant.   This  direction
    applies to both the appellant and to the respondent and  a  failure  to
    comply with this direction could lead to Contempt of Court proceedings.



Introduction

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Iraq who was born on [ ] 1983.  He  is  a
    Kurd and comes from Kirkuk.

 3. He arrived in the United Kingdom and was arrested on 21  February  2003
    having been found in the back of a lorry.  He claimed asylum  and  that
    application was refused on 7 April 2004.  However, on 16 December 2009,
    the appellant was granted leave to remain as the unmarried partner of a
    person settled in the UK.  That leave was valid until 16 November 2011.



 4. On 22  October  2010,  the  appellant  was  convicted  at  the  Bristol
    Magistrates' Court of possessing a class A drug and fined �75.   On  15
    February 2011, he was convicted at  the  Bristol  Crown  Court  on  two
    counts of using false instruments and two counts of knowingly being  in
    possession of false ID documents.  On 10 March 2010, he  was  sentenced
    to a total of twelve months' imprisonment.  As a result,  on  12  April
    2011 the appellant was notified by the Secretary of State that  he  was
    liable to be deported.  On 15 June 2011, the Secretary of State made  a
    decision to deport the appellant to Iraq.

 5. The appellant appealed that decision to the First-tier  Tribunal.   The
    First-tier Tribunal dismissed that appeal on  asylum  and  humanitarian
    protection grounds and under Art 8 of the ECHR.  The Tribunal  made  an
    adverse credibility finding and did not accept the appellant's  account
    that he was at risk on return because of his father's involvement  with
    the Ba'ath Party and because he had refused to  join  the  party.   The
    Tribunal also found that the appellant could not succeed on  the  basis
    of Art 15(c) of the Qualification Directive (Directive  2004/83/EC)  as
    the level of indiscriminate violence in his home area did not reach the
    required threshold under Art 15(c).  Finally, the Tribunal  found  that
    the appellant's removal would not be  a  disproportionate  interference
    with his private life under Art 8 of the ECHR.

 6. On 17 May 2012, the Upper Tribunal granted the appellant permission  to
    appeal solely on the ground that the judge had arguably failed properly
    to consider Art 15(c) of the  Qualification  Directive.   Subsequently,
    the Upper Tribunal (UTJ Spencer) concluded that the First-tier Tribunal
    had erred in law in its approach to  Humanitarian  Protection  and  its
    decision was set aside.  Following that decision,  the  Upper  Tribunal
    (UTJ Grubb) remade the decision in respect of Art 15(c) dismissing  the
    appellant's claim on that ground.  The FtT's decision  to  dismiss  the
    appellant's appeal on asylum grounds and Art 8 stood unchallenged.

 7. Following further submissions, on 13 October  2016,  the  Secretary  of
    State made a further  decision  refusing  the  appellant's  claims  for
    asylum and humanitarian protection and under Art 8 of the ECHR.

The Decision of the First-tier Tribunal

 8.  The  appellant  appealed  against  that  decision  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  In a determination promulgated on  30  January  2017,  Judge
    O'Rourke dismissed  the  appellant's  appeal  on  all  grounds.   Judge
    O'Rourke rejected the appellant's asylum claim based upon his  father's
    involvement with the Ba'ath Party.  Further, departing from the country
    guidance decision in AA (Article  15(c))  Iraq  CG  [2015]  UKUT  00544
    (IAC), the judge found that there was no longer an Art  15(c)  risk  in
    the appellant's home area of Kirkuk.  In any  event,  the  judge  found
    that the appellant could internally relocate to the IKR.  Finally,  the
    judge concluded that the appellant had not established a breach of  Art
    8 of the ECHR.

The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

 9. The appellant sought permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  on  a
    number of grounds challenging the judge's adverse finding in respect of
    the appellant's asylum claim; the judge's departure  from  AA  and  his
    conclusion that the appellant could internally  relocate  to  the  IKR.
    Further, the grounds challenged the adverse decision under Art 8.

10. On 24 February 2017, the First-tier Tribunal (Judge E B Grant)  granted
    the appellant permission to appeal on all grounds.

11. On 16 March 2017, the Secretary of State filed a rule 24 notice seeking
    to uphold the judge's decision to dismiss the appellant's appeal on all
    grounds.

12. Thus, the appeal came before me.

13. At the outset of the hearing, I raised  with  both  representatives  my
    involvement in the appellant's earlier appeal.  Both Ms Fitzsimons, who
    represented  the  appellant  and  Mr  Richards,  who  represented   the
    Secretary of State, indicated that they had no objection to my  dealing
    with the appellant's current appeal.  I indicated  that  whilst  I  was
    content to deal with  the  error  of  law  issue,  if  established  any
    remaking of the decision should be undetaken by a different judge.

Discussion

14. First, Ms Fitzsimons challenged the judge's  decision,  in  effect,  to
    follow the adverse factual finding made by the First-tier  Tribunal  in
    2012 in respect of the appellant's asylum claim based upon his father's
    involvement with the Ba'ath Party.

15. The judge's  reasoning  leading  to  his  adverse  factual  finding  is
    contained within para 21 of his determination as follows:

         "Father's  Ba'ath  Party  Activities.   This   matter   was   fully
         considered in the previous FtT determination of Judge Page in  2012
         [S13].   That  Tribunal  did  not  find  the  Appellant's   account
         credible.  It disbelieved his account  of  his  family  fleeing  to
         Jordan, as if, as he said, he was not in  contact  with  them,  how
         then was he aware of this fact.  It was  also  considered  relevant
         that he had not appealed against the 2004 decision  to  reject  his
         asylum claim, based on the same grounds.  His knowledge as  to  his
         father's position  and  activities  was  considered  very  limited.
         There was no evidence that he had  been  subject  to  any  personal
         threat, or any evidence to indicate that he would continue to be of
         adverse interest after so  many  years  had  passed,  under  a  new
         regime.  His appeal to the UT  did  not  challenge  that  decision.
         There is no new evidence before me to permit  me  to  come  to  any
         other conclusion.  The Appellant's witness evidence is the same  as
         that considered  by  the  previous  FtT  and  he  has  provided  no
         additional  documentary  or  objective  evidence  to  support   it.
         Professor  Joff�  comments  [AB38]  that  there  were  attacks   on
         Ba'athists in Kirkuk in 1991 and that it was plausible, if  he  was
         the son of a Ba'ath Party member that the Appellant would have been
         approached  by  the  Fedayeen,  but  accepts  that  there   is   no
         independent evidence of these events.  We are left, therefore, with
         the Appellant's evidence on this issue which was found  wanting  by
         the previous FtT and  accordingly,  therefore  that  decision  must
         stand, i.e. that the reason he  gives  for  leaving  Iraq  and  the
         related fear on return is not accepted."

16. Ms Fitzsimons submitted that the judge had failed to take into  account
    the evidence of  two  witnesses,  Mr  J  and  Mr  S  in  their  witness
    statements at pages A4-A5 and A6-A7 respectively.  Ms Fitzsimons relied
    upon the evidence of Mr S that he had been to Kirkuk and had spoken  to
    neighbours of the appellant's family who had said  that  they  did  not
    know where they were and that the local Mukhtar had said that  he  knew
    the family but they were "not in the  area  anymore".   It  was  wrong,
    therefore, for the judge to state in the concluding sentence of para 21
    that there was only the appellant's evidence which was "found  wanting"
    by the Tribunal in the earlier appeal.  Ms  Fitzsimons  submitted  that
    this evidence was supportive of the appellant's claim that  his  family
    had had to leave  Kirkuk.   Further,  Ms  Fitzsimons  relied  upon  the
    evidence of Mr J that the reason why the appellant had not appealed the
    earlier Tribunal decision to reject his asylum claim was  that  he  had
    not been able to find a lawyer to represent him.  The appeal forms  had
    been completed by the appellant with the help of Mr J.

17. Whilst the judge does make reference to evidence given by Mr S (and  to
    an extent Mr J) at paras 16 and 23(i) of his determination, he does  so
    only in the context of whether the appellant would  have  support  from
    family or friends on return.  I do not accept Mr  Richards'  submission
    that it was sufficient for the judge to say  that  he  had  taken  into
    account  all  the  "written  evidence"  as  sufficient  to  demonstrate
    consideration of the evidence of Mr S and Mr J.  The evidence of  Mr  J
    was, in large part, of less relevance than that of Mr S when the  judge
    was considering whether, applying Devaseelan [2002] UKIAT  00702  there
    was evidence subsequent to the earlier tribunal's decision which  might
    justify a different factual finding.  Mr S's evidence was,  despite  it
    not directly engaging with the appellant's claim that his father was  a
    member of the Ba'ath Party, some support for his claim that his  family
    had lived in Kirkuk and had left and that their  present  location  was
    unknown.  That was, at least, relevant in applying the  guidelines  set
    out in Devaseelan to the judge's consideration  of  whether  to  depart
    from the "starting point" of the tribunal's earlier factual finding  in
    the light of the evidence before him.  Likewise, although perhaps  with
    somewhat less force, the evidence of Mr J  was  relevant  in  that  the
    earlier tribunal took into account in reaching its adverse  credibility
    finding that the appellant had not appealed the refusal of  his  asylum
    claim in 2004.

18. I do not say that this new evidence should,  or  even  probably  would,
    have led the judge to reach  a  different  factual  finding.   It  was,
    however, relevant and I am unable to say, albeit with some  diffidence,
    that the judge's factual finding would necessarily have been the  same.
    The error was, therefore, material to  that  finding.   Of  course,  it
    would not be material to  the  judge's  dismissal  of  the  appellant's
    appeal on asylum  grounds  if  his  decision  in  respect  of  internal
    relocation was sustainable.  However, for  the  reasons  I  shall  give
    shortly, that is not the case.

19. Secondly, Ms Fitzsimons submitted that the judge  had  failed  to  give
    sufficient reasons, including for rejecting the evidence  of  Professor
    Joff�, in departing from the country guidance case of AA in para 22  of
    his decision concluding that although  Kirkuk  remained  a  "contested"
    area, the level  of  indiscriminate  violence  no  longer  reached  the
    threshold required to establish a  claim  for  humanitarian  protection
    under  Art  15(c)  of  the  Qualification  Directive.   Ms   Fitzsimons
    submitted that the judge's reasoning in para 22 focused unduly narrowly
    upon the risk of civilian casualties; wrongly  characterised  Professor
    Joff�'s evidence that there were "long-term ongoing security  concerns"
    as being "merely speculation"; and failed properly to take into account
    the  appellant's  individual  circumstance  in  Kirkuk  (including  the
    absence of any family) applying the 'sliding scale' adopted by the CJEU
    in Elgafaji v Staatssecretaris van Justitie [2009] 1 WLR 2100 at  [39].



20. Whilst Mr Richards did not formally concede the  points  raised  by  Ms
    Fitzsimons, he acknowledged that he was in some difficulties in arguing
    that the judge was entitled to depart from the country guidance  in  AA
    as it had been - at least in this respect - approved by  the  Court  of
    Appeal in AA (Iraq) v SSHD [2017] EWCA Civ 944.  He acknowledged  that,
    therefore, the guidance in  relation  to  Kirkuk  remained  undisturbed
    despite the Court of Appeal  effecting  an  amendment  to  the  country
    guidance promulgated by the Upper Tribunal (but not  relevant  to  this
    appeal) based upon a concession by the  parties  before  the  Court  of
    Appeal.

21. The judge's reasoning is at para 22 of his determination as follows:

         "Kirkuk - 'contested' area/Art.  15(c).   The  latest  CIG  on  the
         subject, 'Security situation in the 'contested'  areas'  of  August
         2016 [paragraph 3] indicates that  while  Kirkuk  continues  to  be
         'contested',  levels  of  violence  there  have   dropped   [2.3.10
         onwards], being much  lower  when  compared  to  other  'contested'
         areas.  Also, despite only 4% of IDPs coming from Kirkuk, of  those
         returning to 'contested' areas, returnees to Kirkuk make up 20%  of
         the total.  As a consequence, the CIG concludes that Art. 15(c)  is
         no longer engaged in Kirkuk, and  taking  account  an  individual's
         circumstances, persons can generally relocate there.  ISIS has been
         forced out of Kirkuk and there is no indication from the expert  or
         objective evidence that they could return there.   Professor  Joff�
         does not make that claim, merely stating  [AB38]  that  there  will
         continue to be long-term ongoing security concerns and  posits  the
         possibility of future Iraqi Government and KRI  conflict  over  the
         town, but that is, of necessity, merely speculation.  The objective
         evidence relied upon (as set out in paragraph 48 of the Appellant's
         skeleton argument) is either not up to date [CE13 - October  2014],
         or not included in the Bundle [CB1-10], or  indicative  of  ongoing
         terrorist acts and criminality, but  falling  short  of  Art.15(c).
         Reverting to the CIG advice, I see nothing  in  particular  in  the
         Appellant's individual circumstances that  dictate  that  he  would
         fall outside the parameters of a person who could not return: he is
         in his thirties, generally physically fit,  comes  from  the  area,
         speaks the language and his best  chance  of  re-uniting  with  his
         relatives will be there.  I note the medical  evidence  as  to  his
         psychological state, but there  is  no  reason  why  he  could  not
         continue to receive the same medication  in  Iraq.   Some  of  that
         evidence indicates that his 'low mood and anxiety' is  attributable
         to his experience of arrest and imprisonment in UK [A14] and  being
         obliged  to  report  to  a  police  station  which,  while  perhaps
         understandable, cannot be a factor weighing against his  return  to
         Iraq.  His medical notes refer also to 'low mood',  exacerbated  by
         him not being permitted to work [A35] or get citizenship [A19]  and
         his ongoing asylum  claim.   This  will,  no  doubt,  be  a  common
         experience for many asylum-seekers, caught in  'limbo'  while  they
         await an outcome to their claims and  appeals,  but  it  cannot  of
         itself be something that supports such a claim.  I  find  therefore
         that the Appellant can relocate to Kirkuk."

22. Although the judge refers to the appellant being able to  "relocate  to
    Kirkuk" in the final sentence of para 22, that was, of course, his home
    area.  It is clear that the judge's conclusion was that  there  was  no
    Art 15(c) risk in his home area.

23. In the light of Mr Richards' approach to this ground of appeal,  it  is
    unnecessary for me to deal with Ms Fitzsimons  submissions  in  detail.
    As Mr Richards acknowledged, the Court of Appeal in AA (Iraq)  approved
    the country guidance  of  the  Upper  Tribunal  in  AA.   That  country
    guidance was that an Art 15(c) risk existed in Kirkuk, the  appellant's
    home area.  The respondent plainly did not argue otherwise  before  the
    Court of Appeal.  The decision  in  AA  was  "authoritative"  (see,  SG
    (Iraq) v  SSHD  [2012]  EWCA  Civ  940)  unless  "very  strong  grounds
    supported by cogent evidence" justify departure (see, SG at [47]).

24. The judge  accepted  that  Kirkuk  remained  a  "contested"  area  but,
    nevertheless, in the  light  of  the  CIG  Report  on  Iraq,  "Security
    situation in the contested areas" (August 2016) (referred to in para  7
    of the decision letter), he concluded that there had been a  sufficient
    diminution in the levels of violence to depart from  the  authoritative
    finding in AA.  I have considerable doubt as to whether he was entitled
    to do so simply on the basis of that CIG Report.  However, in departing
    from AA, he failed in my judgment properly and fully  to  consider  the
    evidence of Professor Joff�, in particular at para 83(vi) of his report
    (AB38) identifying not only that the area is not "clear of all  threat"
    from ISIS but also that there is a "distinct possibility"  of  conflict
    between Peshmerga forces (of the IKR) and the  regular  Iraqi  Army  or
    militia over control of Kirkuk and the surrounding areas.  It was  not,
    in my judgment, an appropriate characterisation  of  Professor  Joff�'s
    evidence to describe it as "merely speculation".  In  failing  properly
    to grapple with that evidence and the proper weight to be given to  the
    background evidence concerning Kirkuk today, the judge failed  to  give
    adequate reasons for department from the authoritative guidance in  AA.
    As I have already indicated, Mr Richards did not press the Secretary of
    State's case on this issue.  Instead, he sought to argue that any error
    was immaterial as the judge's finding in  relation  to  the  option  of
    internal relocation was sustainable.

25. I now turn to the issue of internal relocation.  The judge  dealt  with
    this at paras 23 and 24 of his determination.  At para 23 he dealt with
    the possibility of relocation to the IKR as follows:

         "Relocation to, or return via the IKR.  In the alternative, I  find
         that the Appellant could relocate to the  IKR,  for  the  following
         reasons:

         i.   He is of Kurdish ethnicity and speaks the language and  again,
             is a thirty-three-year-old fit single man.  As he is an adult,
             I do not view any lack  of  family  links  in  the  KRI  as  a
             significant bar to his return.  I do not  consider  that  this
             situation would be unduly harsh.  He  is  keen  to  work,  has
             worked in UK and has learnt English which may be of assistance
             to him in finding employment.  I accept, from the  expert  and
             objective evidence that there is a refugee crisis in the  KRI,
             but  many  of  these  people  are  Syrians  or  non-Kurds  and
             therefore restricted from work and  restricted  to  IDP  camps
             [CC143] which will not apply to the Appellant.  Also,  he  is,
             as stated, a single adult male, without the burden of  a  wife
             and children, which is not the case for many  IDPs.   Finally,
             he has two very close friends who gave evidence on his behalf,
             both with family and contacts in the KRI who, while  unwilling
             perhaps at this hearing to indicate an ability to assist  him,
             would nonetheless doubtless do  so  if  the  situation  arose.
             Indeed, [Mr S] states that he goes there 'regularly'.

         ii.  CIG 'Iraq: Return/Internal Relocation'  indicates  [5.2]  that
             ethnic Kurds, albeit not from the KRI, will be accepted in the
             KRI, provided they are 'pre-cleared' with the KRI authorities,
             enter on a European Union Letter (EUL) and would fly direct to
             Erbil.  Those persons do not, therefore,  require  a  laissez-
             passer, or passport.  While, currently that does  not  include
             those from Kirkuk that may not continue to be the case and  in
             any event is a matter of the mechanics of return, not a reason
             for rejecting the possibility.  As stated by Ms Fitzsimons, it
             is for the Respondent to provide a safe, legal  and  practical
             route of return and if they cannot do so, then return will not
             be feasible, albeit that such return is lawful, following this
             and previous determinations.  AA (Iraq)  also  indicates  that
             non-KRI Kurds can obtain short-term entry, increased  if  they
             find employment.  Alternatively, in view  of  my  findings  in
             respect of relocation to Kirkuk, the Appellant  could  transit
             through the KRI,  to  the  neighbouring  province  of  Kirkuk,
             obtaining a CSID from his own governorate and if possible  re-
             unite with his family.  I note also that assistance  could  be
             available to him from the Facilitated Returns Scheme."

26. In para 24, the judge accepted that internal relocation to Baghdad  was
    not an option given the appellant's circumstances and lack of  contacts
    or family there.   In  addition  he  stated:  "Transit  from  there  to
    Kirkuk/KRI may also be more difficult, or dangerous."  It follows  from
    that final statement that the option of internal  relocation  was  only
    present if the appellant could be returned directly to the IKR.

27. Ms Fitzsimons raised a number of points  in  relation  to  the  judge's
    reasoning in para 23(i).  She submitted that the judge had  failed,  in
    accordance with AA to consider that the appellant had no family in  the
    IKR.  His finding in relation to the support he would obtain  from  the
    family or contacts of Mr S, Ms Fitzsimons submitted, was contrary to Mr
    S's evidence that they would not be able to assist.  Ms Fitzsimons also
    submitted that the judge had failed properly to  consider  whether  the
    appellant could remain in the IKR as that would be contingent upon  him
    obtaining employment and the evidence  was  that,  given  the  economic
    situation, it was unlikely that he would be able to do so.

28. Mr Richards submitted that the judge's  reasoning  in  para  23(i)  was
    sustainable and made any other error in his decision not material.  The
    judge was entitled to reject the evidence that the appellant's friends'
    families would not be prepared to support the sponsor.

29. In my judgment, there is a fatal flaw in  the  judge's  reasoning.   He
    accepts that the appellant could not relocate to Baghdad  and,  in  the
    final sentence of para 24 that I have set  out  above,  he  effectively
    finds that the appellant could not safely travel from Baghdad to Kirkuk
    or the IKR.  The only method by which the  appellant  could  internally
    relocate to the IKR would, therefore, be as a result of  travelling  by
    air to Erbil in the IKR.  However, in para 23(ii),  the  judge  accepts
    that the IKR will not accept a person, even if they  are  Kurdish,  who
    comes from Kirkuk.  This was not simply, as the judge stated, "a matter
    of the mechanics of return".  It was,  rather,  whether  the  appellant
    could relocate to the IKR.  If he could not  return  there  either  via
    Baghdad or by plane to Erbil, internal relocation to the IKR was simply
    not an option available to him.  In my judgment,  on  the  judge's  own
    findings relocation to the IKR was not open  to  the  appellant  coming
    from Kirkuk despite his Kurdish ethnicity.

30. Whether a person of Kurdish ethnicity could be  returned  to  the  IKR,
    form part of the country guidance in AA which was approved by the Court
    of Appeal.  In para 17 of that guidance it is stated:

         "The respondent will only return P to the IKR if P originates  from
         the IKR and P's  identity  has  been  'pre-cleared'  with  the  IKR
         authorities.  The authorities in the IKR do not require P  to  have
         an expired or current passport or laissez passer."

31. Of course,  the  appellant  does  not  originate  from  the  IKR.   The
    guidance, nevertheless, also provides (at para 19) that a Kurd who does
    not originate from the IKR can obtain entry for ten days as  a  visitor
    and then renew this entry permission for a further ten days.   Such  an
    individual, who finds employment, can remain for  longer  period.   The
    CIG Report, "Iraq: Return/Internal Relocation" (August 2016), which the
    judge referred to in para 23(ii), however points out that the IKR  will
    only accept persons of Kurdish ethnicity who are from an area currently
    under the administration of the IKR, including  some  parts  of  Kirkuk
    Governorate (but not persons from Kirkuk City).  That would  appear  to
    be the basis for the judge's conclusion in para 23(ii)  where,  at  the
    beginning of that paragraph, he accepts that the appellant would not be
    accepted by the IKR at present.

32. On the basis of this evidence, it is wholly unclear to me how the judge
    came to the conclusion that the appellant would be able  to  return  to
    the IKR given that he would at present not be accepted there given that
    his home area is Kirkuk City.

33. Consequently, on the basis of the Country Guidance case of AA  and  the
    evidence to which the judge referred,  I  am  not  persuaded  that  his
    finding that the appellant could relocate to the IKR was properly  open
    to him.  The judge's view that the appellant could "transit through the
    KIR, to the neighbouring province of Kirkuk"  is  also  flawed  if  the
    appellant could not gain entry even if the judge's finding in  relation
    to Art 15(c) in Kirkuk was sustainable - which, as I have  already  set
    out, it was not.

34. For these reasons, I am satisfied that the judge's adverse  finding  in
    relation to internal  relocation  also  cannot  stand  and  it  is  not
    necessary for me to consider the  additional  submissions  made  by  Ms
    Fitzsimons in relation to the appellant's employability  and  what,  if
    any, support he would have in the IKR.  These are matters which can  be
    explored in remaking the decision together with the up-to-date evidence
    concerning the ability of the appellant to reach and enter the IKR.

35. Consequently, I am satisfied that the judge's findings in  relation  to
    the appellant's asylum claim, his humanitarian protection claim relying
    on Art 15(c) and in respect of internal relocation cannot stand.

Decision

36. The decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  to  dismiss  the  appellant's
    appeal involved the making of an error of  law.   The  decision  cannot
    stand and is set aside.

37. In the light of the nature and  extent  of  fact-finding  required  and
    having regard to para 7.2 of the Senior President's Practice Statement,
    the proper disposal of this appeal is that it is remitted to the First-
    tier Tribunal for a de novo rehearing before a judge other  than  Judge
    O'Rourke and, because of the earlier appeal, Judge Page.

38. No submissions were made to me in relation to the decision  to  dismiss
    the appeal under Art 8.  However, in my judgment, the Art 8  claim  can
    only properly be assessed once sustainable factual findings  have  been
    made regarding the appellant's circumstances in Iraq.  As a result,  at
    the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal, a fresh decision in respect
    of Art 8 must also be made.
