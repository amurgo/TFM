                 ERROR OF LAW FINDING - DECISION AND REASONS




     1. This is an appeal against a decision of First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
        Andrew ('the Judge'), promulgated on 18 October 2016, in which  the
        Judge dismissed the appellant's  appeal  against  the  respondent's
        refusal to grant the  appellant  leave  to  remain  in  the  United
        Kingdom outside the Immigration Rules.
     2. The appellant is stated on the  Upper  Tribunal  file  to  have  no
        representative although was assisted by solicitors before the First-
        tier  Tribunal.  Those  solicitors  continued  to   represent   the
        appellant  until  10  January  2017  when  a  letter  was  received
        confirming they are no longer instructed in the case and asking the
        Upper Tribunal to contact the  appellant  at  her  new  address  in
        Walsall.
     3. Permission to appeal was granted in this matter on 30 December 2016
        and a copy of the notice of hearing setting out the date, time, and
        venue was posted to the appellant and the Presenting Officers  Unit
        by first class post on 17 March 2017. The  correspondence  has  not
        been returned to the Tribunal as not having been delivered and  the
        Tribunal is satisfied that there has been valid service of a notice
        of hearing upon  the  appellant  at  her  last  notified  place  of
        service, her new residential address.
     4. Notwithstanding the above,  the  appellant  failed  to  attend  the
        hearing. There is no application for an adjournment or  explanation
        for the appellant's absence. It is considered  appropriate  in  all
        the circumstances for the hearing to  proceed  in  the  appellant's
        absence in light of the fact there is no explanation  for  why  the
        appellant has not attended, the  principles  of  fairness  are  not
        offended by the matter proceeding in light  of  all  the  facts  as
        known, and in light of the overriding objective.



Background


     5. The appellant is a citizen  of  Pakistan  who  appealed  against  a
        refusal to grant leave to remain outside the Immigration Rules. The
        matter came before the Judge at  a  hearing  at  Sheldon  Court  in
        Birmingham on 4 October 2016. The Judge sets out her findings  from
        [4]to [32] of the decision under challenge. Those findings  may  be
        summarised as follows:


        a.    The  appellant's  representative  sought  to  rely  upon  the
             domestic violence provisions of the Rules and Article  8.  The
             claim by the representative he wished to rely upon  an  asylum
             claim was made for the first time at the  hearing.  The  above
             respondent's  representative  confirmed  the  Secretary  State
             would not give consent to the new matter being raised [5].


        b.   The appellant entered the United Kingdom on  27  January  2000
             with a spouse Visa valid 27 January 2001.  The  appellant  was
             later granted leave outside the Rules on 9 August 2011  to  31
             August 2012 [6].


        c.   Paragraph 289A of the Immigration Rules applies [8].


        d.   There was some element of domestic violence in the appellant's
             first marriage [9].


        e.   The marriage did not  break  down  as  a  result  of  domestic
             violence. The appellant's first husband asked her to leave the
             house. Had he not asked her to leave  she  would  have  stayed
             with him. [10].


        f.   The appellant was asked to leave the  house  in  2010  far  in
             excess of the date of 27 January 2001. Thus, the appellant was
             unable to produce  any  evidence  that  the  relationship  was
             caused to permanently breakdown before the end of  the  period
             of leave because of domestic violence [11].


        g.   The appellant is unable to meet the Rules.


        h.   The appellant has given birth to  three  children  during  her
             first  marriage  but  only  has  letterbox  contact  with  the
             children. It is  speculation  on  behalf  of  the  Independent
             Social Worker that the appellant  will  at  any  time  in  the
             future be able to resume any face-to-face contact with any  of
             the three children [13].


        i.    The  appellant  claims  that   her   husband   divorced   her
             Islamically. The appellant's former husband has remarried  and
             on the balance of  probabilities  has  produced  documentation
             either in the  United  Kingdom  or  in  Pakistan  which  would
             confirm that he is divorced and was free to marry [14].


        j.   The appellant would not tell  the  Judge  what  she  had  done
             between 2010 and 2012.  The  appellant  met  another  man  and
             married him Islamically on 5 May 2012. The appellant  has  two
             children from that marriage one aged 4 and the other 2 ï¿½. Both
             of whom are citizens of Pakistan [15].


        k.   The  appellant  has  been  abandoned  by  her  second  husband
             approximately 3 months ago and  she  now  lives  in  an  hotel
             provided by the Local Authority [16].


        l.   The Judge was satisfied there  has  been  a  divorce  and  the
             appellant was free to remarry [17].


        m.   The appellant  continues  to  have  ties  with  Pakistan.  The
             appellant is 36 years of age and lived the first 20  years  of
             her life in Pakistan. The appellant  speaks  the  language  of
             Pakistan has little if any grasp of English.  The  appellant's
             cultural identities are  with  Pakistan  and  not  the  United
             Kingdom and she remains immersed in the  culture  of  Pakistan
             [19].


        n.   The Judge could not be satisfied  on  the  evidence  that  the
             appellant would be at risk on return to  Pakistan.  No  weight
             could be placed upon comments by the Independent Social Worker
             in relation to any alleged risk [20].


        o.   The appellant is unable to meet the requirements of  paragraph
             276ADE of the Immigration Rules [21].


        p.   The Judge adopted the structured approach to assessing Article
             8 outside the rules as per Razgar [24].


        q.   The Judge was not required to consider the  best  interest  of
             the  children  from  the  first  marriage  as  that  had  been
             considered by the Family Court who concluded  it  was  in  the
             children's best interests to only have letterbox contact  with
             the appellant. The best interests of  the  children  from  the
             second marriage were considered in accordance with Section  55
             [25].


        r.   The children from the second marriage are very young and  both
             citizens of Pakistan who would be  removed  to  Pakistan  with
             their mother as a family unit [26].


        s.   The Judge was unable to accept the  appellant's  claim  as  to
             ostracism from her family was  credible.  In  any  event,  the
             appellant will be able to take advantage  of  the  support  in
             Pakistan such as shelters or crisis  centres.  At  least  some
             accommodation will be available  for  the  appellant  and  the
             children in Pakistan [27 - 29].


        t.   The appellant is not integrated into the United  Kingdom.  The
             appellant speaks no English and there is nothing to  show  she
             can ever be financially independent [30].


        u.   On the evidence the Judge was unable to make  a  finding  that
             there are any compelling circumstances in this matter [31].


     6. The appellant sought permission to appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal
        which was granted by Acting Resident Judge Appleyard in a  decision
        dated 30 December 2016, the operative section of which reads:


        3.   The ground seeking permission to appeal argue that  the  Judge
             erred in her assessment  of  whether  the  Appellant  suffered
             domestic violence, found that the Appellant's  former  husband
             was "legally divorced" in the absence of any evidence to  that
             effect, speculated, misdirected herself under the  Immigration
             Rules in relation to family and  private  life  and  erred  in
             dealing with the Article 8 issues.


        4.   These grounds are all arguable.



Error of law


     7. In relation to the domestic violence element of the case, the Judge
        accepted that there was some element of  domestic  violence  within
        the first marriage. The Judge thereafter  concluded  that  even  if
        there had been evidence of domestic violence it did not  cause  the
        marriage to permanently breakdown.
     8. The Judge correctly set out  the  appellant's  immigration  history
        which is relevant to assessing whether the appellant  was  able  to
        succeed under paragraph 298A of the Immigration Rules.
     9. 298A sets out the requirements for indefinite leave  to  remain  in
        the United Kingdom as the victim of domestic violence. The  current
        domestic violence rules are now contained in  Appendix  FM  section
        DVLR although a number of complex transitional provisions are to be
        found in paragraph 280(c) of the Rules. These provide that where an
        applicant was granted entry clearance or limited leave to enter  or
        remain as a spouse before 9 July 2012 where the applicants leave to
        enter or limited leave in that capacity remains  extant,  then  the
        old paragraph 289A continues to apply on domestic violence  issues.
        I was not referred to  these  provision  specifically.   The  Judge
        noted that as the application was made as long  ago  as  22  August
        2013 the earlier paragraph still applied. There is no challenge  to
        this element of the decision.
    10. The requirements of 298A include a requirement for (a) admission to
        the UK for a period not exceeding 27 months as a  spouse  or  civil
        partner of a person present and settled in the United Kingdom or an
        unmarried or same sex partner of a person present  and  settled  in
        the United Kingdom (b) the grant of leave to remain as  the  spouse
        or civil partner  or  unmarried  partner  or  same-sex  partner  in
        accordance with paragraphs  285  or  295E  of  the  Rules  (c)  the
        relationship with the spouse or civil partner or unmarried  partner
        or same-sex partner was subsisting at the  beginning  of  the  last
        period of leave granted in accordance with relevant  provisions  of
        the Rules and (d) is able to produce evidence to establish that the
        relationship was caused to permanently breakdown before the end  of
        that period as a result of domestic violence.
    11. The Judge noted that the relevant qualifying period  of  12  months
        expired on 27 January 2001 yet the  appellant  did  not  leave  her
        husband's property until 2010. Based on  the  evidence  before  the
        Judge, the finding that the appellant had failed to show  that  the
        relationship had broken down before  the  end  of  the  appropriate
        period as a result of domestic violence was a conclusion fully open
        to the Judge on the facts.
    12. In relation to the judge's finding that the appellant was divorced,
        this was a conclusion fully open to the Judge.  The source of which
        is to be found within the Independent Social Workers report in  the
        applicant's appeal bundle. The conclusion by the Judge  based  upon
        that evidence was  a  finding  fully  open  to  her  based  on  the
        appellant's own evidence.
    13. The Judge properly considered the requirements of paragraph  276ADE
        and no arguable legal error is made out in relation to  [19]  where
        the Judge assesses the nature of the  ties  the  appellant  has  to
        Pakistan. Finding that very  significant  obstacles  to  return  to
        Pakistan had not been made out is a conclusion fully  open  to  the
        Judge based on the evidence provided.
    14. The Judge proceeded to consider the merits of the Article  8  claim
        outside the Immigration Rules by following the five-step structured
        approach in Razgar [2004] UKHL 27 in which the Judge had regard  to
        section 117 A and B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act
        2002. The Judge was also aware of the need  to  consider  the  best
        interests of the appellant's children  from  her  second  marriage,
        having given adequate and sustainable reasons for why  it  was  not
        necessary to consider the best interests of the children  from  the
        first marriage.
    15. The conclusion the best interests of the  children  of  the  second
        marriage are to remain with their mother with whom  they  shall  be
        removed as a family unit is a finding reasonably open to the Judge.
    16. The reality of return for the appellant with two young children was
        clearly in the Judges mind. There  is  specific  reference  to  the
        appellant claiming that she will be homeless on return to  Pakistan
        and consideration of the relevant  country  guidance  and  reported
        decisions of the Upper Tribunal relating  to  the  availability  of
        shelters and effective protection for women who have  been  victims
        of domestic violence who are returned to Pakistan. The appellant is
        divorced and free to marry reducing the risk of family reprisals.
    17. The Judge who heard the  appellant  give  evidence  considered  the
        written material and concluded that the appellant's claims were not
        credible and there was nothing preventing her taking  advantage  of
        the available support  in  Pakistan,  including  accommodation  and
        other resources available.
    18. Although the Grounds raise several issues they  fail  to  establish
        any arguable legal error material to the decision  to  dismiss  the
        appeal in the determination under challenge.
    19. The Judge considered the  evidence  with  the  required  degree  of
        anxious scrutiny and has given adequate reasons  for  the  findings
        made, all of which fall within the  range  of  findings  reasonably
        open to the Judge on the basis of the evidence  she  was  asked  to
        consider.


Decision

    20. There is no material  error  of  law  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal
        Judge's decision. The determination shall stand.


   Anonymity.


    21. The First-tier Tribunal did not make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
        45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
        2005.


        I make no such order pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal  Procedure
         (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008).
