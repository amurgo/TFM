Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Phil Hayward, instructed by Turpin & Miller LLP
For the Respondent:    Mr Nath, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant is a citizen of Zimbabwe  born  30  September  1957.  She
    entered the United Kingdom on 3 December 2000. Although the exact  date
    of her entry into the United Kingdom  is  not  clear  from  the  papers
    before us (the dates referred to therein ranging from 2000 to 2002), it
    was agreed between the parties at the hearing that she  had  been  here
    since at least 2001. It is not in dispute  that  she  entered  using  a
    lawfully issued visit visa.  She  was  subsequently  granted  leave  to
    remain as a student 31 August 2006. She  sought  an  extension  of  her
    leave by way of an application made on the 27 December 2006,  but  such
    application was refused in 18 January 2007.

 2. The Appellant did not thereafter leave the country as required, and  on
    31 December 2008 she claimed asylum. The Appellant claimed, in summary,
    that she had worked for a printing company in Zimbabwe in  the  binding
    department.  In order of priority, she undertook to print out some  MDC
    leaflets whereupon she was confronted by  eight  men  who  entered  the
    premises, claiming to be members of the  "Border  Gezi  Youth  League,"
    which is an arm of the ZANU-PF. These men ill-treated her because their
    work had been relegated behind that of the MDC,  "the  Appellant  tried
    to persuade them that she was only doing her job and that it was simply
    due to a difference between the times at which she had  access  to  the
    materials" but "the men continued to make her  interview  uncomfortable
    and unpleasant," which led to there being  "some  veiled  threats  that
    they would be looking out for her and for other members of the printing
    works".

 3. The Secretary of State refused the Appellant's application by way of  a
    decision dated 1 July 2009, making a decision to remove  the  Appellant
    at the same time. The  appellant  appealed  the  Secretary  of  State's
    decision to the then Asylum and Immigration Appeal Tribunal.

 4. The appeal has a chequered history.  It was first heard by  Immigration
    Judge Del Fabbro (as he then was) on 5th August 2009.  The  Immigration
    Judge  dismissed  the  appellant's  appeal   on   Refugee   Convention,
    Humanitarian  Protection  and  Articles  3  &  8  ECHR  grounds,  in  a
    determination sent to the appellant on the 20 August 2009.

 5. An order for reconsideration  was  made  by  Senior  Immigration  Judge
    Jordan (as he then was), on 10 September 2009. On 6 January 2010 Senior
    Immigration Judge McKee (as he then was) found material  error  in  the
    determination of Immigration Judge Del Fabbro, in what was  then  known
    as  the  "first  stage"  of  the  reconsideration  process.  SIJ  McKee
    concluded that the immigration judge had  made  no  clear  findings  on
    whether the incident which allegedly  caused  the  Appellant  to  leave
    Zimbabwe actually took place, where the Appellant would go on return to
    Zimbabwe, where the other members of her family were, and whether  they
    had any problems with the authorities or  with  ZANU-PF.  He  indicated
    that the appeal would be re-heard de novo.

 6. The appeal next came before Upper Tribunal Judge Perkins on 19th  March
    2010, in order that he may re-make the decision under appeal. The focus
    of this hearing was on the Appellant's claim under Article 8 ECHR.  The
    judge reserved his decision.

 7. On 8th February 2013, nearly  three  years  later,  Principal  Resident
    Judge Southern issued directions observing  (i)  that  the  appeal  had
    indeed been heard on 19th March 2010 and (ii) "for reasons that are not
    at all clear, nothing  subsequently  happened.Judge  Southern  directed
    that the appeal should not be determined by Judge Perkins, and  made  a
    transfer order giving effect to such direction.

 8. On 5th April 2013, further directions were given at a  case  management
    hearing to the effect that the parties be given the decision  of  Judge
    McKee dated 6th January 2010, which  set  aside  the  determination  of
    Immigration Judge Del Fabbro; that the positive findings of  fact  made
    in that determination, as regards the incident described in paragraph 3
    of the determination, should stand as a starting point  for  the  Upper
    Tribunal's  own  factual  findings;  and  that  skeleton  arguments  be
    provided for the hearing in the Upper Tribunal.

Preliminary Issue

 9. At the outset of the hearing before us issue was raised by the  parties
    as to the scope of appeal. Mr Nath submitted that we ought to determine
    the appeal on a de novo basis, following a decision of  Upper  Tribunal
    Judges Kekic and Moulden made after a  hearing  on  14  May  2013.   Mr
    Haywood asserted that the findings of  fact  made  in  the  appellant's
    favour by Immigration Judge Del Fabbro ought to be maintained.

10. We pause at this point  to  observe  that  the  handwritten  record  of
    proceedings of the hearing of 14 May 2013  clearly  indicate  that  the
    panel concluded that the appeal should be determined  de  novo  by  the
    Upper Tribunal. However, no  reasons  are  given  for  this  conclusion
    within that record, although it does indicate that a  written  decision
    would be issued. This, though, was never done.

11. After some  discussion  at  the  hearing  before  us  Mr  Nath,  whilst
    maintaining that the Tribunal's consideration ought to be on a de  novo
    basis, nevertheless, sensibly accepted that even if this were the  case
    the evidence before the Tribunal led to the inescapable conclusion that
    the appellant had credibly detailed the events she claimed had occurred
    prior to  her  departure  from  Zimbabwe.  As  a  consequence  of  this
    concession there was no necessity for us to determine the issue set out
    above.

Opening Submissions

12. Given the complexity of the appeal we, thereafter, invited  Mr  Haywood
    to make opening submissions.

13. He firstly submitted that the Appellant was a  refugee,  following  the
    decision in CM (EM Country Guidance;  Disclosure)  Zimbabwe  CG  [2013]
    UKUT 00059.  This was said to be so because of the criminal  activities
    of the Chipangano and the risk  such  activities  would  cause  to  the
    appellant.  In support of his submission Mr Haywood took us to  various
    passages within the decision in CM (Zimbabwe), including the following,
    found at paragraph 198 of the determination, "weighing the evidence, we
    find that Chipangano has been responsible  for  acts  of  violence  and
    intimidation  outside  Mbare  on  limited  occasions  and  largely   in
    neighbouring suburbs such as Epworth and Highfields".

14. We observe at this  stage  however  that  whilst  the  decision  in  CM
    (Zimbabwe) refers to the criminal activities of the Chipangano, it also
    records in  the  next  breath  that,  "there  is  scant  evidence  that
    Chipangano has any significant range or  influence  in  low  or  medium
    density suburbs of Harare and their forays into the centre of the  city
    are infrequent ..." (para 198).

15. Second, Mr  Hayward  submitted  that  there  has  been  a  "conspicuous
    unfairness" in the treatment of the Appellant because had  this  appeal
    been promptly dealt with by the Upper Tribunal the determination in  RN
    (Zimbabwe) [2008] UKAIT 00083 would have been extant and the  Appellant
    would have succeeded in his appeal brought on asylum grounds.

16. Third, and in any event, Mr Hayward observed that the Appellant has  an
    adult daughter, Florence Makumire, in the United Kingdom. He  submitted
    that Ms Makumire's letter of support (see page  9  of  the  Appellant's
    bundle) leaves little doubt that the Appellant has a viable claim under
    Article 8 ECHR to remain in this country.

The Evidence

17. We have before us a bundle from the Secretary of State and a number  of
    bundles from the appellant. These bundles are all indexed and  as  such
    we do not propose to list the documents contained therein.

18. We heard oral evidence from the appellant, Mr Philip Mugarawa-Gobru, Ms
    Emelia Luwizhi and Ms Florence Makumire.

19. The first witness was the Appellant herself.  She adopted  her  witness
    statement dated 13th June 2013.  She was directed to  page  29  of  the
    bundle where  her  witness  statement  confirmed  that  her  house  was
    demolished in Warren Park.  At the time she had been married,  however,
    with the destruction of her home, her  relationship  with  her  husband
    deteriorated. In response  to  the  examination-in-chief,  the  witness
    confirmed that she and her husband separated in 2005 and  she  did  not
    know where he was at present.

20. In cross-examination by Mr Nath the witness was asked whether after her
    alleged mistreatment by the "Border Gezi Youth  League"  she  had  been
    subjected to further difficulties.   She  explained  that,  "I  had  no
    political affiliations at the time.  It was a  simple  misunderstanding
    that I could  not  get  the  books  bound  in  time.   It  was  nothing
    political.  If I returned I don't know if I could go back there."   She
    went on to confirm her relationship with her daughter (see her  witness
    statement at page 25 of the supplementary bundle).  She said  that  her
    daughter had helped her to cope emotionally with her time  in  the  UK.
    Mr Nath put it to the witness that at page 11 of her daughter's witness
    statement dated 25th April 2013 her daughter had said  that  she  would
    find it difficult to return to Zimbabwe to visit her mother because  of
    the cost of airline flights; she had  not  referred  to  any  political
    difficulties for either of them.  The witness replied, "I don't  know."



21. She was then asked what she intended to do in  the  UK  if  allowed  to
    remain and replied that she would like to do something for  herself  by
    improving upon her education.  She said she  had  no  one  in  Zimbabwe
    because her three sons were all in South Africa and since  her  husband
    had remarried she had no contact with him.

22. We observed to the witness that the evidence before  us  suggested  she
    had two nieces, Tendai and Memory, in Zimbabwe. The Appellant  accepted
    that that was indeed the case.

23. In reply to the cross-examination, Mr  Hayward  asked  the  witness  if
    Tendai and Memory could give  her  any  assistance  in  Zimbabwe.   The
    witness said that she had not spoken to them for a long time, when they
    were very young.  She thought that they lived in Marandera.   She  said
    that Memory was aged 25 and Tendai was  older  and  she  did  not  know
    whether they worked.  She had heard that Memory had married.

24. The second witness was  Philip  Mugarwa-Gobru,  the  Appellant's  adult
    nephew. He adopted his witness statement  (at  pages  7  to  8  of  the
    bundle) dated 13th June 2013.  He had a 4� year old son that his  aunt,
    the Appellant, looked after when he was at work.  He said that  he  was
    also doing a course in life chances at Birkbeck College, University  of
    London and was starting another course  at  Queen  Mary  and  Westfield
    College in biomedical sciences later this year.  He  said  his  partner
    was working, having finished the first year of a law degree.   As  both
    of them led busy lives, they looked to the Appellant  to  provide  care
    for their 4� year old son.

25. Mr Hayward asked the witness what  impact  the  Appellant's  return  to
    Zimbabwe would have on their lives.  The witness said  that  since  his
    father passed away, the Appellant was the person who is there for them.
     They referred to his witness statement where he said that  "she  binds
    us together."  He said that she was the eldest of the  girls  in  their
    family.  She was now the only one left in the UK.  In  any  event,  she
    had nothing to return to in Zimbabwe.

26. In cross-examination the witness  was  asked  by  Mr  Nath  whether  he
    himself was in contact with anyone in Zimbabwe.  He replied to say that
    he was in contact with church members because his grandfather  was  one
    of the founding members of their church and they are seen as the family
    of church leaders.  Indeed, his  aunt,  the  Appellant,  also  goes  to
    church.  He said that he was dependent upon the Appellant because since
    his father died, his mother in Zimbabwe had gone now to live  with  her
    family and she had maintained no connection with the Gobvu family.   He
    confirmed that he last contacted his mother in 2000  in  Zimbabwe.   He
    said his aunt was not in touch with anyone in  Zimbabwe.   Having  only
    been granted refugee status himself in 2010, the witness said  that  he
    had not returned back to Zimbabwe either.

27. He was asked what his aunt, the Appellant, does in his household.   The
    witness said that, "she helps with the cleaning, helps with the  child,
    drops him off at school, and picks him up."  When Emilia  Luwizhi  [the
    Appellant's niece who is a student in London] comes  from  London,  the
    appellant and Emilia talk about Emilia's welfare and her studies.

28. The witness was asked why  the  Appellant  did  not  apply  for  asylum
    earlier.  He said he did not know.  He was asked whether his aunt,  the
    Appellant, had ever mentioned the incident in Zimbabwe to him.  He said
    that this was the case.  He knew that she had got  into  trouble  while
    undertaking some printing work.  He said, "she had a contract  for  the
    MDC and for ZANU-PF, but they printed all the MDC work  first  and  not
    the ZANU-PF, and they got her into trouble with the  former.   She  was
    stripped naked."

29. Finally, the witness was asked how he knew (as disclosed by paragraph 6
    of his statement) that the Appellant would be subject to  reprisals  if
    she returned to Zimbabwe.  He replied  by  stating  that,  "she  has  a
    phobia of going back" and that she was "emotionally disturbed"  at  the
    thought of returning back.  There was no re-examination.

30. The third witness was the Appellant's adult niece, Emilia Luwizhi.  She
    adopted her witness statement (at page 9 of the bundle). There  was  no
    further  examination-in-chief,  nor  any  cross-examination   of   this
    witness.

31. The  fourth  witness  was  Florence  Makumire,  the  appellant's  adult
    daughter.  She adopted her witness statement (at page 11 of the bundle)
    dated 25th April 2013.  In her evidence-in-chief,  she  confirmed  that
    her son is currently aged 16 years and her daughter aged 7 years.   She
    worked as a social worker.

32. The witness continued her evidence by asserting said  that  her  mother
    helped her as a child carer, as she was struggling to  build  a  career
    herself.  She said that  her  mother  was  a  "second  mother"  to  her
    children.  It was not financially viable for the  appellant  to  go  to
    live in Zimbabwe.  She  would  also  have  no  food  and  no  transport
    facilities there.  Her family in the UK would not be able to visit her.
    The family house had been destroyed in 2005 and there would be  nothing
    for the appellant to return  to.   She  said  that  she  supported  her
    brother in South Africa.  She also said that one  of  her  brothers  in
    South Africa had died and the other one was looking after the children.



33. There was no cross-examination of this witness.

34. In response to a question from ourselves, the  witness  confirmed  that
    when she and her family go on holidays, they take  the  Appellant  with
    them because, "she is part of our family"  and  that  "I  want  her  to
    experience the holiday with us."

Closing Speeches

35. In his closing speech, Mr Nath, submitted that the Appellant could  not
    qualify for refugee status and had no demonstrable risk of  being  ill-
    treated in Zimbabwe.  She had worked in a printing  company.   She  was
    molested simply because the Border Gezi Youth League, who were used  to
    having their own way, found out that their printing  material  had  not
    been processed.  If the Appellant was subjected to molestation  it  was
    not on account of political violence.  The Appellant had  no  political
    profile.

36. The Appellant had today confirmed that other people were  also  working
    there but that nothing happened to anybody else in any event,  whatever
    happened ten years ago and there were no further reprisals of any kind.
     She could not show a risk of ill-treatment upon return.

37. As for her Article 8 ECHR claim, it was asserted that  this  would  now
    need to be  assessed  under  the  new  Immigration  Rules  despite  the
    decision in MF  (Article  8  -  New  Rules)  [2012]  UKUT  393.   Under
    paragraph 276ADE the appellant could not show that she had been in  the
    UK  for  twenty  years.   She  could  not  show  that  there  were  any
    "exceptional circumstances."  Much of her life had  been  in  Zimbabwe.
    It was true that she had been in the UK for  some  twelve  and  a  half
    years now.  However, the new Immigration Rules  refer  to  "exceptional
    circumstances," and even if she  had  been  looking  after  her  family
    members in the UK, this was  not  "exceptional."   She  had  not  given
    evidence of any  other  activity  that  she  performed  that  could  be
    regarded as "exceptional."  She had an interest in  becoming  a  dental
    nurse, but that was not "exceptional."  There was the issue of a  delay
    of three years following the hearing before  Senior  Immigration  Judge
    Perkins.  That too, however, was not "exceptional."

38. The Appellant had arrived a visitor's visa and had then overstayed. She
    has family in Harare.  Her nieces Tendai and Memory live  in  Zimbabwe.
    There is family support there.  Even if there had been  no  delay,  the
    Appellant would not have succeeded, because the refusal letter  of  1st
    July 2009 made it clear that the Appellant's claim  was  without  merit
    (see paragraph 40 onwards which  refers  to  the  relevant  situation).
    Accordingly, if the steps  in  Razgar  were  applied  with  respect  to
    Article 8 ECHR, all that the Appellant could show was that she has been
    here for twelve and a half years, and that she helps out with the  care
    of a child, but nothing more.  She could not succeed.

39. In his closing speech, Mr Hayward  relied  on  the  skeleton  arguments
    before us.  He emphasised the following points.  First,  the  Appellant
    would be returning, having lived in a high density area  Harare,  to  a
    situation where she had no family, and where she was in  her  50s,  and
    would have to fend for herself against the Chipangano.

40. Second, the Appellant could succeed under paragraph  395C  of  HC  395.
    There was a difference between this provision in the Immigration  Rules
    and Article 8 ECHR.  Article  8  ECHR  looked  at  the  wider  picture.
    Paragraph 395C considered specific factors that had to  be  taken  into
    account before  removal.   It  was  therefore  more  favourable  to  an
    applicant in some respects than Article 8  ECHR.   A  consideration  of
    those factors would surely militate against the Appellant's removal.

41. Third, the Appellant's credibility was strong.  She had made  it  quite
    clear that she was not political.  She has said that she is not in  the
    MDC.  But, she says that she cannot return.  She left on the  basis  of
    her fear, and that fear is  still  ongoing.   Mr  Haywood  took  us  to
    various country materials, including those contained at  pages  73  74,
    76, 79 and 81 of the appellant's bundle, which, he submitted, supported
    a conclusion that the Appellant could not  reasonably  return  back  to
    Zimbabwe.  In this respect he observed the  evidence  contained  within
    pages 116 and page 124  of the bundle were also important

42. Fourth, there are family life rights in play.  The  Appellant's  family
    life is getting stronger because she is living with her family members,
    and looking after their children. She has been  on  holidays  with  her
    daughter and her family. She has participated in the development of the
    children over a lengthy period.  Her family life cannot  be  replicated
    in Zimbabwe.  She provides emotional support to the family in  the  UK.
    The cultural context of so doing was important.

43. Fifth, there had been a delay within the Tribunal  Service  since  2009
    and the case of Rashid [2005] EWCA Civ 744 confirmed  that  this  could
    cause "conspicuous unfairness" to the Appellant and  the  consideration
    of her claim. We pause at this juncture to observe that  after  lengthy
    discourse  with  between  the  Tribunal  and  Mr  Haywood,  Mr  Haywood
    indicated  that  the  appellant  was  not  pursuing  the   'conspicuous
    unfairness' point as a freestanding argument, but that  it  was  to  be
    taken as a relevant factor in the consideration by the Tribunal of  the
    Article 8 ECHR and paragraph 395C grounds.

44. Mr Hayward invited the Tribunal to allow the appellant's appeal.

Re-making the Decision

45. In  re-making  the  decision,  we  proceeded,  pursuant  to  Mr  Nath's
    concession, on the basis that the account given by  the  appellant  (in
    the evidence pre-dating the date of  the  hearing  before  us)  of  the
    events  which  caused  her  to  leave  Zimbabwe,   was   truthful.   We
    nevertheless dismiss the appeal brought on the basis of the Appellant's
    claim to face persecution  or  ill-treatment  were  she  to  return  to
    Zimbabwe. Our reasons are as follows.

46. First, in relation to the Appellant's claim that she faces  a  risk  of
    ill-treatment  in  Zimbabwe,  we  make  the  following  findings.   The
    Appellant travelled  to  the  United  Kingdom  apparently  on  her  own
    passport.  It is a matter of some intrigue as to what happened to  that
    passport.  It has not been produced  before  us.   There  has  been  no
    explanation as to its whereabouts.  The Appellant's claim that she came
    on 3rd December 2000 was made in her screening interview.   That  claim
    changed during her asylum interview when the Appellant  suggested  that
    she had left Zimbabwe in September 2002.   The  inconsistency  has  not
    been explained in any credible manner, although  as  we  have  detailed
    above, it was agreed between the parties that the appellant had in fact
    been in the United Kingdom since at least 2001.

47. The appellant's asylum claim was based upon her producing leaflets  for
    the MDC, whilst at the same time having an unfulfilled  printing  order
    from the ruling party. We accept that there is a reasonable  likelihood
    that the Appellant was visited by the Border Gezi Youth League  in  the
    way explained by Judge Del Fabbro at paragraph 3 of his  determination.
    We also accept that she was questioned vigorously about her printing of
    the MDC leaflets and ill treated in the manner  claimed.  There  is  no
    credible evidence, however, that the company she  worked  for  suffered
    any adverse consequences. The Appellant asserted at the hearing  before
    us that the printing  company  had  been  closed  down,  however,  this
    evidence had not previously been given and, in any event, the Appellant
    also stated that no reasons had been given to her for such closure.  We
    further observe that the appellant left Zimbabwe  after  this  incident
    using her own passport without any difficulties or problems.

48. The Appellant has family members still living in Zimbabwe and her  sons
    lived there for some time after her departure, although they  now  live
    in South Africa.  There  is  no  evidence  that  these  family  members
    suffered any reprisals as a consequence of the Appellant's actions,  or
    indeed that the authorities contacted  the  family  members  after  the
    Appellant's  departure  from  the  country,  looking  for   her.    The
    whereabouts  of  the  Appellant's  husband  is  unknown.   She  has  no
    political profile, and does not claim to have any. She is certainly not
    a supporter of the MDC.  The Appellant lived  in  Warren  Park,  Harare
    (see answer to question 10 of the SEF)  prior  to  coming  to  the  UK,
    although this house was destroyed in 2005 for  reasons  unconnected  to
    the Appellant's departure.

49. When coming to our conclusions we have applied the country guidance set
    out in the recent decision of CM (Zimbabwe) [2013]  UKUT  00059.   This
    confirms that, as a general matter, that  there  is  now  significantly
    less politically motivated violence in Zimbabwe than was previously the
    case and that the return of a failed  asylum  seeker  from  the  United
    Kingdom, with no significant MDC profile, would, in general, not result
    in that person facing a real risk of having to demonstrate  loyalty  to
    the ZANU-PF.

50. In relation to return to Harare the tribunal in CM (Zimbabwe) concluded
    as follows:


         "A  returnee  to  Harare  will  in  general  face  no   significant
         difficulties, if going to a  low-density  or  medium-density  area.
         Whilst the socio-economic situation in high-density areas  is  more
         challenging, in general a person without ZANU-PF  connections  will
         not face significant problems there (including a  "loyalty  test"),
         unless he or she has a significant MDC profile, which  might  cause
         him or her to feature on a list of those targeted  for  harassment,
         or would otherwise engage in political activities likely to attract
         the adverse attention of ZANU-PF, or would be reasonably likely  to
         engage in such activities, but for a fear of thereby coming to  the
         adverse attention of ZANU-PF."

51. The Appellant claims to come from a high density area.  It is  accepted
    that the situation of  a  returnee  in  these  circumstances  is  "more
    challenging". We find, however, that the  Appellant  will  not  face  a
    loyalty test if returned to Harare and  not  face  any  problems  there
    significant problems as a consequence of her lack of  support  for  the
    Zanu-PF. She has no MDC profile at all, still less  a  significant  MDC
    profile.

52. We further note that the availability of food and other goods in  shops
    has improved in Harare.  There is, indeed, a large informal economy  in
    Zimbabwe, which ranges from street traders to  home-based  enterprises,
    which returnees can expect to avail themselves of.

53. We were addressed specifically on  the  problems  in  Harare  from  the
    Chipangano.  The issue of "problems in Harare" was  specifically  dealt
    with by CM (Zimbabwe) [2013] UKUT 00059.  In its head note the tribunal
    gave the following note of caution in this regard:

        "In  the  light  of  the  evidence  regarding  the  activities   of
        Chipangano, judicial-fact finders may need to pay particular regard
        to whether a person, who is reasonably likely to go to Mbare  or  a
        neighbouring high density area of Harare, will come to the  adverse
        attention of that group; in particular, if he or she is  reasonably
        likely to have to find employment of a kind that  Chipangano  seeks
        to  control  or  otherwise  exploit  for  economic,   rather   than
        political, reasons."

54. The origin, nature, and activities of the Chipangano were  specifically
    considered  by  the  tribunal  in  paragraphs  196  to   201   of   its
    determination. It was noted that the Chipangano have  been  responsible
    for acts of violence and intimidation within Mbare, although such  acts
    have occurred outside Mbare on limited occasions, although such  events
    largely  took  place  in  neighbouring  suburbs  such  as  Epworth  and
    Highfields. They do not have any significant range or influence in  low
    or medium density suburbs of Harare. Their activities have not led to a
    significant rise in overall number of human rights  violations  in  the
    city) and the evidence before the tribunal in CM fell short of  showing
    that Chipangani is an arm of the Zanu-PF (paragraph 198)

55. The driving force  behind  the  Chipangano  is  the  "intent  on  self-
    enrichment .... at the expense of those working in transport and in the
    informal economy ... primarily in the high density area of Harare known
    as Mbare" (see paragraph 200).

56.  The  Appellant  is  not  returning  to  Mbare  or  one  of  the  areas
    neighbouring Mbare.  WE find, on  the  evidence  before  us,  that  the
    appellant is not reasonably likely to seek employment of such a kind or
    in such an area so as to  encounter  Chipangano  'touts'  Consequently,
    given what is said about the Chipangano in CM, we find that it  is  not
    reasonably likely that she  is  a  risk  of  suffering  treatment  from
    Chipangano that would engage the Refugee Convention.

57. In any event, we find that the Appellant could return to a low  density
    or medium density suburb of Harare, observing as  we  do  so  that  her
    family home in the high density area  of  the  city  was  destroyed  in
    20005. Such relocation would not, in all the circumstances of the  case
    including those prevailing in Harare, be unduly harsh or  unreasonable.



58.  We  therefore  dismiss  the  Appellant's  appeal  brought  on  Refugee
    Convention, grounds.

59. As we have found that the Appellant is not a refugee, we must  consider
    whether she qualifies for humanitarian protection.  We  find  that  the
    background country information evidence does not indicate that a person
    such as the Appellant would be at real risk of suffering serious  harm.
    There is now a coalition government  in  Zimbabwe  with  power  sharing
    between the leaders of the two major parties.  The leader  of  the  MDC
    has asked people settled abroad to return back to his country.   Having
    found that  the  Appellant  is  not  a  refugee  because  she  has  not
    established a well-founded fear of persecution,  by  analogy,  we  find
    that the Appellant cannot qualify for humanitarian protection either.

60. We must also consider the Appellant's human rights claims.  As we  have
    found that the Appellant has not established  a  well-founded  fear  of
    persecution, by analogy, we find that her claim does not engage Article
    3 of the Human Rights Convention either.  We find that  she  would  not
    face a real risk, if returned, of "inhuman and degrading treatment"  in
    Zimbabwe.  Accordingly, we find that the Appellant would not suffer ill-
    treatment contrary to Article 3.

61.  Turning to Article 8 ECHR, the application  of  the  'new'  family  and
    private life related immigration rules  (HC  194)  to  appeals  against
    decisions of the Secretary of State made prior to the 9 July  2012  was
    considered by the Upper Tribunal  [Upper  Tribunal  Judges  Storey  and
    Coker] in the reported decision of MF (Article 8 - new  rules)  Nigeria
    [2012] UKUT 00393 (IAC).  The tribunal was not persuaded that  the  new
    rules had retrospective effect such that they were  of  application  to
    decisions of the Secretary of State taken prior  to  9  July  2012.  It
    further concluded that the new rules were not conclusive of the Article
    8 issue; there were two questions  to  be  answered,  (i)  whether  the
    decision is in accordance  with  the  Rules  and  (ii)  whether  it  is
    accordance with the law as  interpreted  by  the  senior  courts  whose
    decisions are binding. The tribunal noted a number of respects in which
    the new rules appeared to apply tests that have been disapproved of  by
    the courts. This approach was endorsed  in  Izuazu  (Article  8  -  New
    Rules) [2013] UKUT 00045.

62.  Despite that which is said above it  is  nevertheless  plain  that  the
    content of  the  Immigration  Rules  properly  informs  the  Article  8
    assessment made outside of the Rules in that they  identify  with  some
    specificity what the public interest is.

63.   With  that  in  mind  we  have  undertaken  a  consideration  of   the
    appellant's claim under the current immigration rules and find that she
    cannot succeed  under  paragraphs  276ADE  to  276DH  or  Appendix  FM,
    including Section EX of that Appendix, of the Immigration  Rules.   She
    has not been here twenty years in residence. We do not  find  that  the
    circumstances of her case can be described as exceptional.

64. We find, however, that the Appellant can succeed outside the  Rules  on
    the basis of the existing jurisprudence of Article 8 ECHR.

65. The Appellant has a substantial family and private life in the  UK.  We
    accept the  evidence before us as to the  extent  and  nature  of  such
    ties. The appellant lived with her daughter, Florence, from the time of
    her arrival in the United Kingdom until December 2011. During that time
    she established a close bond not only with her daughter, but  with  her
    daughter's young children whom she took care of whilst Florence and her
    husband were at work. The youngest of Florence's children was born at a
    time when the appellant was already living in the family home.

66. In December 2011 the  appellant's  sister  became  seriously  ill  with
    cancer. The appellant moved to live with her  sister  and  Emilia  (her
    sister's adult daughter). She provided support for her sister and  also
    for Emilia. The appellant's sister passed away in March of  this  year.
    Emilia moved to college accommodation in London and the appellant moved
    in with her nephew Phillip. She sees Emilia at weekends,  and  provides
    moral and emotional support to her. The appellant now looks  after  and
    cares for her nephew's child, who is aged just 4 �).  Philip stated, of
    the appellant, (at para 7 of his witness statement) that "she binds  us
    together" because she is the eldest of those in the family, and she  is
    now effectively the matriarch of  the  family.   She  looks  after  the
    family, she cleans the house, she drops  the  children  to  school  and
    picks them up'.

67. In Navaratnam Kugathas v Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department
    [2003] EWCA Civ 31, Arden LJ said  as  follows,  when  considering  the
    issue of family life between an adult child and his parents:


        "[24] There is no presumption that a person has a family life, even
        with the members of a person's immediate family. The court  has  to
        scrutinise the relevant factors. Such factors  include  identifying
        who are the near relatives of the  appellant,  the  nature  of  the
        links between them and the appellant, the  age  of  the  appellant,
        where and with whom he has resided in the past, and  the  forms  of
        contact he has maintained with the other members of the family with
        whom he claims to have a family life.


        [25] Because there is no presumption of family life, in my judgment
        a family life is not established between an  adult  child  and  his
        surviving parent or other siblings  unless  something  more  exists
        than normal emotional ties: see S v  United  Kingdom  (1984).  Such
        ties might exist if the appellant were dependent on his  family  or
        vice versa..."

68. In the same case Sedley LJ accepted the  submission  that  'dependency'
    was not limited to economic dependency, stating:


        "[17] But if dependency is read down as meaning  "support"  in  the
        personal  sense,  and  if  one   adds,   echoing   the   Strasbourg
        jurisprudence, "real" or "committed" or  "effective"  to  the  word
        "support", then it represents in my view the irreducible minimum of
        what family life implies."


69. After a  careful  examination  of  both  United  Kingdom  and  European
    jurisprudence [an examination later approved of by the Court of  Appeal
    in Shamilla Gurung & others],  the  Upper  Tribunal  [Lang  J  and  UTJ
    Jordan] observed  as  follows  in  Ghising  (family  life-adults-Gurkha
    policy) [2012] UKUT 00160:



        "[62] The different outcomes in cases  with  superficially  similar
        features emphasises to us that the  issue  under  Article  8(1)  is
        highly fact-sensitive.  In our judgment,  rather  than  applying  a
        blanket rule with regard to adult children,  each  case  should  be
        analysed on its own facts, to decide whether  or  not  family  life
        exists, within the meaning of Article 8(1). As Wall  LJ  explained,
        in the context of family life between adult siblings:

          "We do not think that Advic is authority for the proposition  that
          Article 8 of the Human Rights Convention can never be engaged when
          the family life it is sought to establish is  that  between  adult
          siblings living together. In  our  judgment,  the  recognition  in
          Advic that, whilst some generalisations are possible, each case is
          fact-sensitive places an obligation on both Adjudicators  and  the
          IAT to identify the nature of the family  life  asserted,  and  to
          explain, quite shortly and succinctly, why it is that Article 8 is
          or is not engaged in a given case."   (Senthuran  v  Secretary  of
          State for the Home Department)."


70. We find that looking at the family unit as a whole  the  appellant  has
    more than the normal  emotional  ties  with  her  daughter,  her  niece
    (Emilia) and her nephew (Phillip). She also has a significant and close
    bond with her nephew's child and with her grandchildren. We  accept  Mr
    Haywood's submissions that the appellant has established a family  life
    in United Kingdom with  these  relatives.  We  find  that  there  is  a
    protected family life here  and  the  support  that  she  provides  and
    receives is real and effective in the  way  that  family  life  support
    normally is.

71. If we are wrong in this conclusion then such the  bonds  the  appellant
    has formed with  her  relatives  in  the  United  Kingdom  nevertheless
    plainly form a substantial part of her private life here.

72.  Applying Lord Bingham's tabulation in Razgar (at para 17) we find  that
    the proposed removal of the Appellant would be  an  interference  by  a
    public authority with the exercise of the Appellant's right to  respect
    for  private  and  family  life.   The  interference  caused   by   the
    appellant's removal would have consequences of such gravity  so  as  to
    engage the operation of Article 8.  The interference is  in  accordance
    with  the  law.  It  is  common  ground  the  Respondent's  policy   of
    immigration control is 'a  legitimate  aim  in  the  interests  of  the
    economic well being of the country'.

73.  The public interest in a firm a fair system of immigration  control  is
    considerable and  we  have  borne  fully  in  mind  the  terms  of  the
    immigration rules and the fact that  this  appellant  cannot  meet  the
    requirements set out therein, when coming to our conclusions.

74.  We have set out above the nature and extent of the  appellant's  family
    and private life ties to the United Kingdom. The weight to be  attached
    to such ties is though reduced by the fact that they  have  been  built
    up, at least since August 2006,  at  a  time  when  the  appellant  had
    lawfully right to remain in the  United  Kingdom.  We  also  recognise,
    however, that the appellant's  appeal  has  remained  in  the  Tribunal
    system for approximately 4 years through no fault of her own.  She  was
    not required to leave the United Kingdom during this  time.   In  total
    the appellant has remained continuously living in  the  United  Kingdom
    for over 12 years, although over half of her stay has been unlawful. We
    further take into account  that  although  the  appellant's  return  to
    Zimbabwe will not lead to a breach of Article 3 ECHR, the conditions in
    that country are still generally harsh and unpalatable.




75. Looking at all the matters in this case in the round,  including  those
    mentioned above, those raised by the Secretary of State in her  refusal
    letter and those detailed by the representatives before  us,  we  find,
    despite the considerable weight attached to the public interest,  that,
    in particular, the length of the appellant's stay in  the  UK  and  the
    nature and extent of her relationships with her various family members,
    in particular the children in her family, that the appellant's  removal
    from the United Kingdom is not  proportionate  to  the  legitimate  aim
    sought to be achieved by the Secretary of State. We therefore  conclude
    that the appellant's removal is unlawful under s6 of the  Human  Rights
    Act 1998 as being  incompatible  with  her  Article  8  rights  and  we
    accordingly allow her appeal.

Decision

The decision Immigration Judge Del Fabbro  is  set  aside  for  the  reasons
already given.

The appellant's appeal is allowed on the basis that her removal is  unlawful
under s6 of the Human  Rights  Act  1998  as  being  incompatible  with  her
Article 8 rights.
