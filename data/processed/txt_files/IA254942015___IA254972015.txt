Representation:

For the Appellants:    Ms U Miszkiez, Counsel, instructed by Jein
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr T Wilding, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellants are citizens of Cameroon born on 15th November 1985  and
    1st September 1988 and are married.  The appeal of the second appellant
    is dependent on that  of  the  first.   The  first  appellant  made  an
    application for indefinite leave to remain on the basis  of  the  Armed
    Forces Appendix of the  Immigration  Rules  and  that  application  was
    refused  on  7th  July  2015.   Notice  was  given  for  liability   to
    administrative removal of  the  appellants  under  Section  10  of  the
    Immigration Act 1999 as overstayers and a decision was made  to  remove
    the appellants from the United Kingdom.

 2. The first appellant had arrived in the United Kingdom in 2011  under  a
    Tier 4 Migrant visa  valid  until  24th  September  2014.   The  second
    appellant arrived thereafter in May 2012 as his  dependant  with  leave
    valid to the same date.  On 31st March 2012 the  appellant  joined  the
    Territorial Army as a reservist.  On 12th May 2012 a decision was  made
    to curtail the leave of the appellant as the appellant was in breach of
    his Tier 4 visa conditions as he had ceased to  study.   On  11th  July
    2012 his leave was therefore curtailed with no right of appeal  and  on
    8th July 2013 a son was born to the  appellant.   The  child  does  not
    appear to have been included as an appellant.  On  7th  July  2014  the
    appellant submitted the application as a member of the armed forces and
    on  24th  September  2014  the  appellant  was  discharged   from   the
    Territorial Army as it was thought that this  was  the  date  the  visa
    expired, it being a condition of service that he have a valid visa.

 3. The Secretary of  State's  refusal  stated  that  his  leave  had  been
    curtailed and therefore his employment  was  unlawful  as  he  was  not
    entitled to work.  Exempt status by reason of engagement  with  the  TA
    was applicable  only  on  TA  duties.   The  appellant  did  not  serve
    permanently with the armed  forces  and  there  was  no  provision  for
    aggregating time to reach the four years of service  required  for  his
    application.  The members of the HM Forces Reserves could not  normally
    apply for leave to enter or  remain  on  the  basis  of  their  reserve
    service.  In relation to the second appellant she had provided  an  ETS
    TOEIC certificate which was no longer accepted from 1st July  2014  and
    she had not completed a continuous period of 60 months with leave under
    Appendix AF as the partner of someone serving in Her Majesty's  Forces.
    She  therefore  failed  to  meet  that   requirement   as   well.    No
    consideration was given to rights under Appendix FM or paragraph 276ADE
    as no human rights application or a fee paid application had been made.
     There were no Article 8 reasons given  and  the  Section  55  Borders,
    Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 duty was met as the appellants and
    their children would return to Cameroon as a family unit.

 4. On appealing the first appellant submitted that his  daughter  born  on
    25th September 2014 needed medical care and there were no  other  means
    of supporting himself.  The Secretary of State had failed to take  into
    account the service with the TA of the appellant and the appellant  had
    not known of the curtailment of his visa and he had never received  it.
    He had not worked illegally.  He had established a private  and  family
    life in the UK as a diligent citizen.

 5. The grounds of appeal were field further to  the  'old'  provisions  of
    Section 82(1)(d).

 6. At the First-tier  Tribunal  hearing,  as  recorded  by  the  judge  at
    paragraph 18 of his determination, the appellants accepted  they  could
    not meet the provisions under either Appendix FM or  paragraph  276ADE.
    They relied on Appendix AF of the Immigration Rules and Article 8 and I
    note that the grounds of appeal included a reference to  appealing  the
    Secretary of State's exercise of discretion.  The judge  recorded  that
    the appellant had given evidence he had never been discharged from  the
    Army Reserves.

 7. When the appellant was asked during the hearing  whether  he  had  ever
    studied or completed study in the  UK  the  appellant  stated  that  he
    obtained a PhD  online  through  Berkeley  University  (paragraph  26).
    Before he came to the UK the appellant had worked as an accountant.  He
    had one brother and two sisters who worked in Cameroon and his wife had
    family in Cameroon (paragraph 29).   He  also  confirmed  that  he  had
    received �2,500 to �3,500  per  month  from  his  father  and  friends,
    (paragraph 30).  He produced however no evidence of the PhD, (paragraph
    31).

 8. The submissions on behalf of the appellant were recorded by  the  judge
    and reference made to the skeleton argument and emphasis was placed  on
    the fact that the appellant had not had been served with a  curtailment
    of his leave and so he could not be found to  be  an  overstayer.   The
    application leading to the appeal was lodged prior to the visa expiring
    so he had leave by reason of Section 3(c) of the Immigration  Act  1971
    because of the application and the appeal.  The  appellant  had  joined
    the Territorial Army, now the Army Reserves, on 31st March 2012 and had
    now completed over four years of reckonable  service  and  fell  for  a
    grant of indefinite leave to remain and with him his dependant.  As  he
    remained lawfully in the UK by virtue of Section  3c  and  was  not  an
    overstayer and had four years' reckonable  service  then  he  would  be
    eligible for a grant of leave to remain.  The  best  interests  of  the
    children were a primary consideration.

 9. In summary it was submitted that  although  the  appellants  could  not
    succeed under paragraph 276ADE their appeal should be  allowed  outside
    the Rules.

10. The judge in his decision stated as follows:

         "41.     The appellant knew that if he did not  attend  his  course
             his visa would be terminated.   The  email  from  the  college
             dated 31 October 2011 (A6) expressly said so.  He attended  no
             lectures after that.  He cannot possibly have thought that his
             visa was still existent through  to  24  September  2014.   He
             stated that he did not  receive  notice  of  its  curtailment.
             While noting that no documentary evidence of such  notice  has
             been produced, it would have been a matter of routine  and  on
             the balance of probabilities I find he was served with  notice
             of curtailment.  I do not find him  a  credible  witness,  and
             find that he did receive such a notice.  Even if he  did  not,
             he will have known that his leave would have  been  curtailed.
             Accordingly he was without leave when  the  applications  were
             submitted.  Any service with the TA/Army Reserve would  confer
             exemption only in respect of that service.  In  assessing  the
             credibility of the appellant I noted that his application  for
             fee exemption stated  that  he  had  no  means  of  supporting
             himself, but in evidence to me stated that he  had  income  of
             between �2500 and �3500 monthly from his father.  I note  also
             his fabricated PhD, and the untruthful use of the  title  'Dr'
             on his notepaper.

         42.      The appellant produced a payslip to show that he was  last
             with the TA/Army Reserve on 16 August 2016, and  so  had  more
             than 4 years service after enlistment in March  2012.   If  so
             his service was unlawful as no one without a visa  can  be  in
             the TA/Army Reserves.  The appellant has had no visa since  11
             July 2012, and such service would not be 'reckonable  service'
             for that reason.  Even if the visa had not been  curtailed  it
             would have expired on 24 September 2014, and he has  had  none
             since, so that his reckonable  service  would  have  been  2.5
             years only.  I have been shown no evidence  that  S3(c)  leave
             applies to service with the TA/Army Reserves.  In any event  I
             find that 'reckonable service'  is  actual  service,  not  the
             length  of  time  since  joining,  so  that   the   cumulative
             reckonable service of the appellant is to be measured in a few
             weeks, not years."

11. The judge specifically stated at paragraph 48:

         "48.     A claim to rely on  Appendix  AF  cannot  succeed  as  the
             appellant was not with  the  TA/Army  reserves  for  4  years.
             There is no  information  before  me  as  to  how  'reckonable
             service' is calculated, and no submissions were  made  on  the
             point.  If it were relevant (that is if the appellant had been
             in the TA/Army Reserves for 4 calendar years) I find  that  he
             would not have 4 years 'reckonable service' as this is  likely
             to mean 4 years full time service when aggregated.   It  seems
             to me very unlikely that serving 3 hours a week  for  4  years
             (600 or so hours, or less than 3 months actual service)  would
             confer the right to a grant of indefinite leave to remain.  It
             is for the appellant to prove his case, and even if he  had  4
             calendar years in the TA/Army Reserve  his  appeal  would  not
             succeed for this reason."

12. The First-tier Tribunal dismissed the appeal.

13. The appellant submitted an application for permission to appeal on  the
    following grounds.

 1) Ground (i).  The first  appellant  consistently  denied  receiving  the
    curtailment notice dated 12th May 2012 and it was for the respondent to
    prove  that  it  had  been  served,  see  paragraphs  34  to  46,  Syed
    (curtailment of leave -  notice)  India  [2013]  UKUT  144  (IAC).   No
    documentary evidence of such notice had been produced by the respondent
    even at the hearing.  Nevertheless the judge found that  the  appellant
    was served with a notice of curtailment and did  receive  such  notice,
    paragraph 41.  This was unsupported by the  evidence  and  inadequately
    reasoned.  To state that "it would have been a matter of  routine"  was
    speculative.  The judge did not find him to be a credible  witness  and
    failed to give sufficient reasons for this finding.

    The appellants had valid leave until 24th September 2014 and  therefore
         that the applications made on 7th July 2014 were submitted in time.
          Accordingly the appellants had continuing  leave  under  3C.   The
         judge erroneously found  that  the  first  appellant's  service  in
         August 2016 was unlawful and that he had no leave since  11th  July
         2012.  The judge states "I have been shown no evidence that Section
         3C leave applies to service with the TA/Army  Reserves",  paragraph
         42, but this reasoning was inadequate  since  Section  3C  had  the
         effect of extending lawful leave on the same condition as before.

    Ground (ii).  The judge erred in his findings  and  in  his  Article  8
         assessment was flawed.  The judge found the PhD was fabricated  and
         bought online but fails  to  give  any  adequate  reason  for  this
         finding.  That the appellant's account was unsupported did not mean
         the qualification was untrue.

    In relation to the letter dated 26th June from Seven Day Healthcare  as
         regards having similar problems in November 2011 and May  2012  the
         judge found: "This was reporting what the appellant  had  told  the
         DR, who had not examined the appellant then, nor seen  his  medical
         records",  paragraph  24.   This  was  inadequately  reasoned   and
         speculative.

    The judge found there  was  no  medical  condition  of  relevance.   An
         inadequate  account  was   taken   of   the   daughter's   hospital
         appointments dated February, March and June 2015 and  reference  to
         "further assessment".  An inadequate  account  was  taken  of  this
         material evidence.

    The judge found that the first appellant was  not  presently  with  the
         Army Reserves and had not been so since 24th September 2014 because
         there was one payslip.  However, this finding  was  unsupported  by
         the evidence contained in the  appellants'  bundle  and  the  judge
         failed to take adequate account of the British Army  identity  card
         valid until 10th June 2019 and seven payslips from October 2015  to
         April 2016.

    Further, the judge found that the reckonable service was actual service
         or full-time service when aggregated,  not  length  of  time  since
         joining but failed  to  give  sufficient  or  any  reasons  for  so
         finding.  The judge erred in finding the first  appellant  had  not
         had four years' reckonable service ([42], [45] and [48]).

 2)  Overall,  the  errors  vitiated  the  judge's  assessment  under   the
    Immigration Rules.  He had not given adequate  reasons  further  to  MK
    (duty to give reasons) Pakistan [2013] UKUT 641 (IAC).

 3)  The  above  errors  vitiated  the  assessment  under  Article  8.   In
    particular,

 a. the judge found the family and private life was not engaged,

 b. the judge failed to direct himself to the threshold of engagement,

 c. the judge failed to consider  the  modified  proportionality  test  and
    erroneously applied the test of exceptionality,

 d. there was no proper assessment of the balancing exercise,

 e. the judge failed to reach a  finding  on  the  best  interests  of  the
    children,

 f. the judge failed to consider whether it was reasonable  to  expect  the
    family to relocate to Cameroon and instead considered  a  no  obstacles
    test,

 g. the judge failed to take adequate account of his valuable  contribution
    to British society, and

 h. the judge erroneously treated the considerations under Section 117B  as
    determinative.

14. At the hearing before me it was submitted by Ms Miszkiez that arguments
    had been raised by Mr Wilding which she  was  not  confident  that  she
    would be able to respond to fully in submission.  It was agreed  by  Mr
    Wilding that he  could  not  defend  the  reference  by  the  judge  to
    curtailment but that the curtailment letter had indeed been  served  on
    the college, which was the address the appellant  had  given  the  Home
    Office.

15. Ms Miszkiez submitted that the consideration of the 3(c) leave affected
    the  judge's  assessment  of  credibility,   which   contaminated   the
    assessment under Article 8.  It could not be said that it was a  matter
    of routine for curtailment letters to be served and that was  an  error
    of law.  The credibility assessment overall under Article 8 was fatally
    flawed and not defensible.  I was  referred  to  the  letter  from  the
    Rifles dated 3rd June 2014.  Ms Miszkiez stated that the letter  showed
    that the appellant had been able to serve with the Reserves as  he  had
    Section 3(c) leave and was not in breach of a condition.   He  was  not
    discharged, had leave and was not working in breach of condition.   The
    Secretary of State's refusal letter was flawed and  not  in  accordance
    with the law.  The skeleton argument  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    made the point that the decision was not in  accordance  with  the  law
    because the leave had  not  been  effectively  curtailed.   The  matter
    should be remitted back to the Secretary of State.  The appellant would
    now raise the matter of his application for naturalisation.

16. The judge had approached the  matter  on  the  basis  of  the  lack  of
    credibility of the appellant, which affected his assessment of  Article
    8.  Even if the application was not successful, part of the  assessment
    under Article 8 was that the appellant was in breach of the Immigration
    Rules.  The application must be properly considered and  the  appellant
    was entitled to a lawful decision.

17. Mr Wilding submitted that there was an error in the approach  to  Syed.
    It was agreed that Judge Housego had asked the wrong question.  In  his
    investigations Mr Wilding could not establish what postal  address  had
    been given by the appellant  and  there  was  no  concession  that  the
    curtailment had not been notified to  the  appellant  although  he  did
    concede that the formulation of  the  question  by  Judge  Housego  was
    incorrect and he could not have said that there was  service  when  the
    letter of service had not been put before him.

18. However, even if that were the case the appellant bears the  burden  of
    proof and Mr Wilding made specific reference to  Section  86(3),  which
    states:

         "The Tribunal must allow the appeal insofar as it thinks that -

         (a)      a decision against which  the  appeal  is  brought  or  is
             treated as being brought was not in accordance  with  the  law
             (including Immigration Rules), or

         (b)      a discretion exercised in making a decision against  which
             the appeal is brought or is treated as  being  brought  should
             have been exercised differently",

but Section 86(4) states:

         "For the purposes of subSection (3) a decision that a person should
         be removed from the United Kingdom under a provision shall  not  be
         regarded as unlawful  if  it  could  have  been  lawfully  made  by
         reference to removal under another provision."

That, Mr Wilding submitted, was fatal because the appellant could have  been
    given removal directions under Section 47 rather than  under  the  1999
    Act.  Even if it was right that there was  no  proper  curtailment  the
    error relied on did not amount to an unlawful decision as there was  an
    alternative route.  The language in Section 86 referred to "could"  and
    not "would".  It was not enough to say  that  the  Secretary  of  State
    issued an unlawful immigration decision as he could have  been  removed
    under Section 47 on the basis of the refusal of the application.

19. The appellant applied under the Immigration Rules but the type of  case
    'not in accordance with the law' was in relation to a policy not  being
    considered.  The Tribunal cannot  allow  an  appeal  as  being  not  in
    accordance with the law if another provision could have been  used  and
    this showed the teeth of Section 84.  The appellant was not studying  a
    few months after his arrival at the college and for which the  CAS  was
    issued, therefore he had indeed failed to study and therefore he  still
    would have been in breach.  That was accepted.

20. However, and moreover, the appellant  applied  under  Appendix  AF  and
    applied as somebody who had been discharged but he had not in fact been
    discharged and therefore paragraph  16  did  not  apply  to  him.   The
    Secretary of State applied the correct Rules and the Rules in force  at
    the date of the application were the same as those in force at the date
    of the decision.   I was referred to paragraph 16 and paragraph 11  set
    out as follows:

         "16.     Indefinite leave to remain as a  foreign  or  Commonwealth
             citizen discharged from  HM  Forces  will  be  granted  to  an
             applicant who:

             (a) is in the United Kingdom;

             (b) is not in breach of immigration laws, except  that,  where
                  paragraph 39E of these Rules applies, any  current  period
                  of overstaying will be disregarded

             (c) has made a  valid  application  for  indefinite  leave  to
                  remain as a foreign  or  Commonwealth  citizen  discharged
                  from HM Forces;

             (d) does not fall to be refused on the grounds of  suitability
                  under paragraph 8 or 9; and

             (e) meets the general eligibility  requirements  in  paragraph
                  11.

         11.      The general  eligibility  requirements  to  be  met  as  a
             discharged member of HM Forces are that:

             (a) the applicant:

                  (i)  has completed at least 4 years' reckonable service in
                      HM Forces; or

                  (ii) meets the medical discharge criteria in paragraph 12;
                      and

             (b) on the date on which the application is made:

                  (i)  the applicant has been discharged from HM Forces  for
                      a period of less than 2 years; or

                  (ii) in  the  case  of  an  applicant  who  was  medically
                      discharged more than 2 years before, new  information
                      regarding his or her prognosis is being considered by
                      the Secretary of State; or

                  (iii)      the applicant has been granted his or her  most
                      recent period of limited leave:

                      (aa)  under paragraph 15 or 19 of this Appendix as  a
                           foreign or  Commonwealth  citizen  who  has  been
                           discharged  from  HM  Forces;   or   (bb)   under
                           paragraph 276KA or 276QA of these Rules; or

                      (cc)  under  the  concession  which  existed  outside
                           these  Rules,  whereby  the  Secretary  of  State
                           exercised her discretion to grant leave to  enter
                           or remain to members of HM Forces who  have  been
                           medically discharged; and

             (c) in relation to an application made by a Gurkha, the Gurkha
                  is a citizen or national of Nepal."

21. Paragraph 16 refers to indefinite leave to remain by  someone  who  was
    discharged from the HM Forces and indeed it was  the  appellant's  case
    that he had not been discharged.  The earliest time he could have  been
    discharged to meet the requirements is 7th July 2012 but  here  he  was
    not discharged on 7th July  2014  and  therefore  could  not  meet  the
    requirements on any reading.

22. Thirdly, in relation to reckonable service he must be discharged.  When
    he applied he had only been in the UK just over three  years.   On  any
    reading the applicant was  going  to  fail.   It  was  clear  from  the
    skeleton argument at the First-tier Tribunal that he was saying that he
    satisfied paragraph 16 and all parties approached  the  matter  on  the
    basis of a misunderstanding.  The appellant failed under  11(a)(i)  and
    failed under (b)(i).  The appellant was arguing that he was working and
    therefore not discharged and indeed the part of  the  grounds  to  this
    Tribunal referred to the military card as continuing to be valid.  This
    was unanswerable.

23. The second point was whether for the purposes of 11(a)(i)  a  reservist
    could qualify as a member of HM Forces.  I was referred  to  the  Armed
    Forces Act of 2006 and provision 368, which specifically refers to  the
    regular forces.  The appellant was claiming to be a member of  the  TA.
    This did not apply to reservists.

24. Fourthly, the four years' reckonable service was grappled with  by  the
    judge such that the appellant was only exempt from immigration  control
    when he was deployed or due to be deployed.  The appellant may have had
    leave to remain as a student as he was not  effectively  curtailed  but
    his reckonable service only stemmed from when he was deployed or due to
    be deployed and that was three hours per week.

25. At this point Ms Miszkiez submitted that  these  were  new  submissions
    but, as I pointed out, the appellant had indeed applied under  Appendix
    AF and also the point on reckonable service was raised in  the  grounds
    for permission to appeal.

26. Mr Wilding submitted that when he was not serving he  needed  leave  in
    another capacity and the judge approached this correctly.   Service  of
    three hours per  week  could  not  amount  to  four  years'  reckonable
    service.  The payslips showed �500 to �600 payment a month and that was
    not evidence that he was due to be deployed for the entire period.

27. Not least one must be discharged by the date of the application and  by
    the date of application the appellant needed to be discharged  for  two
    years and he could not show that.  His application was doomed to fail.

28. The case of Syed could be distinguished on the basis that the appellant
    had lawful leave which continued to run and it  was  not  open  to  the
    Secretary of State to curtail that leave.  In this case, even if  there
    had been a failure to serve the notice of curtailment  the  substantive
    leave had expired and where there was a refusal  by  the  Secretary  of
    State there could always be a removal decision served with it,  whereas
    in Syed there was no removal provision for a  person  whose  leave  was
    still running.

29. In relation to Article 8 the  credibility  point  did  not  infect  the
    analysis made under the Immigration  Rules  and  the  judge  based  the
    finding in relation to Article 8 on the circumstances  of  the  family.
    In essence there was no obstacle to the family  returning  to  Cameroon
    and I was referred to the findings at paragraphs 44,  46  and  47.   In
    relation to the failure to consider Section 55  this  family  would  be
    removed together and further there was no  specific  challenge  to  the
    assessment of the children's best interests.  There was  no  suggestion
    that the children were going anywhere else  other  than  with  the  two
    appellants.

30. There was no  failure  to  deal  with  the  medical  evidence  and  the
    children, see paragraph 32, and the evidence was not up-to-date.

31. Ultimately the appellants had failed to properly evidence  their  claim
    to remain in the UK and despite an unhelpful  lack  of  signposting  in
    relation to Section 55 any explicit  consideration  would  not  show  a
    material difference.

32. The key point in relation to Syed was that he still had leave when  the
    decision was made.  That was not the case here.

33. Ms Miszkiez submitted that the Secretary of State relied on a breach of
    condition and anything that followed rendered  the  decision  unlawful.
    The appellant was entitled to  a  lawful  decision  regardless  of  the
    outcome and this was a material error.  If  Section  86(3)  applied  it
    should be submitted back to the Secretary of State  and  Section  86(4)
    was a red herring.  Even if the application was submitted on the  wrong
    basis the applicant was nevertheless entitled  to  a  lawful  decision.
    The appellant was notified that he would  be  discharged  by  the  army
    after the expiry of the visa and he would then be discharged.   He  had
    exempt status even on three hours per week.

34. In relation to  his  reckonable  service  the  judge's  calculation  of
    reckonable service was fatally flawed.  There was no information on how
    it was calculated.

35. The assessment of credibility had not given the appellant  any  benefit
    in relation to his service in the Reserves  and  his  belief  that  the
    appellant was a forger also affected the judge's view of Article 8.

36. There was no Section 55 analysis and the assessment on  proportionality
    was flawed.  Ms Miszkiez submitted that the matter should  be  referred
    back to the Secretary of State  and/or  secondly  that  the  matter  be
    remitted back to the First-tier Tribunal.  Further, there should be  an
    anonymity direction.  In addition, Mr Wilding submitted that if it  was
    considered that the point in regard to Syed was a material error of law
    the Upper Tribunal was capable of determining the Article 8 decision as
    there were no extensive findings of fact required.

Conclusions

37. Essentially First-tier Tribunal Judge Housego found that the  appellant
    had had no visa since 11th July 2012 but he stated: "Even if  the  visa
    had not been curtailed it would have expired on  24th  September  2014,
    and he has had no leave since, so that  his  reckonable  service  would
    only have been 2.5 years."  Notwithstanding that conclusion, the  judge
    made a finding that "reckonable service" is  actual  service,  not  the
    length of time since joining so that the cumulative reckonable  service
    of the appellant was to be measured in a few weeks, not years.

38. The appellant argues that he continued to have  leave  because  of  his
    3(c) leave and his service should have been taken into account.

39. The appellant made an application under Appendix AF  and  the  relevant
    Immigration Rules have been set out above.  The appellant simply cannot
    satisfy this part of  the  Rules.   Specifically,  which  both  parties
    agreed this is the only application that the appellant could  make  and
    both parties agreed that the grounds advanced  by  the  appellant  were
    that he had not been discharged.  As can be seen from paragraph  16  it
    is specific to indefinite leave  to  remain  applications  that  he  is
    discharged.  The point is that  the  appellant  under  the  Immigration
    Rules would need to have shown that he was discharged and he could  not
    possibly do that and he did not contend that.

40. Further, it is clear that  the  appellant  could  not  as  a  reservist
    qualify as a member of  HM  Forces  without  having  been  a  full-time
    member.  As set out in the relevant definition in Appendix AF  at  Part
    1, paragraph 2:

         "(d)     'A member of HM  Forces'  is  a  person  who,  subject  to
             subparagraphs (e) and (f), is a member of the  regular  forces
             within the meaning of the Armed Forces Act 2006."

41. This is also made evident by Section 374 of the Armed Forces  Act  2006
    which defines as follows

    'the 'regular forces' means the Royal  Navy,  the  Royal  Marines,  the
         regular army or the Royal Air Force, and references to  'a  regular
         force' are to be read accordingly;

    'the reserve forces' means the Royal Fleet  Reserve,  the  Royal  Naval
         Reserve, the Royal Marines Reserve, the Regular Reserve,  the  Army
         Reserve, the Royal Air Auxiliary Air Force, and the  references  to
         'a reserve force' are to be read accordingly'.

In effect, the appellant was a member of the  Territorial  Army  subject  to
    the Reserve Forces Act 1996 which states at Section  1(2)(b)  that  the
    reserve forces include the Army Reserve and the Territorial  Army.   He
    had never been a member of HM Armed Forces  for  the  purposes  of  the
    Armed Forces Act 2006 or the Immigration Rules even whilst deployed  as
    a reservist and subject to service law (Section  376(2)  of  the  Armed
    Forces Act).

42. Despite the close analysis of the above, which  was  not  discussed  by
    either representative or the First-tier Tribunal Judge  at  the  First-
    tier Tribunal the appellant had not undertaken four  years'  reckonable
    service because he had not been in the 'regular forces'.  He could  not
    amass reckonable service.  The judge was correct, in finding  that  his
    reckonable service could not be taken into account.  I also  find  that
    reckonable service can only mean when the appellant is deployed or  due
    to be deployed.  These points are regardless of the question about  his
    3(c) leave.  I do not accept that the appellant  was  deployed  at  all
    stages during his four and a  half  years,  particularly  when  he  was
    supposed to be on a student visa, albeit that he was not studying.   It
    is clear that those in the TA need alternative leave  such  as  student
    leave.

43. As the decision letter from the Secretary  of  State  established,  his
    exemption from immigration control under Section 8(4) only applied when
    he was on active service with  HM  Forces  or  in  his  case  the  Army
    Reserves.

44. The decision letter of the Secretary of State was  in  accordance  with
    the law as it clearly  stated  that  the  appellant  had  not  met  the
    requirements of paragraph 16(e)  of  Appendix  AF  of  the  Immigration
    Rules, which requires that the appellant :

         "(e)     meets the general eligibility  requirements  in  paragraph
             11",

The appellant had not been a discharged  member  of  HM  Forces  or  accrued
    reckonable service and did not meet the eligibility requirements.  This
    was the case whether or not his leave had been  curtailed  and,  as  Mr
    Wilding pointed out, on the basis of the refusal the Secretary of State
    under  Section  86(4)  could  have  implemented  the  removal  via   an
    alternative route although I do not analyse that  point  further.   The
    judge found at paragraph 42:

         "42.     Even if the visa had not  been  curtailed  it  would  have
             expired on 24th September 2014, and he has had none since,  so
             that his reckonable service would have been 2.5 years only.  I
             have been shown no evidence that Section 3(c) leave applies to
             service with the TA/Army Reserves.  In any event I  find  that
             'reckonable service' is actual service, not the length of time
             since joining, so that the cumulative  reckonable  service  of
             the appellant is to be measured in a few weeks, not years."

45. Regardless of the remaining analysis by the judge that was correct  and
    on any analysis the appellant could not succeed under Appendix AF.

46. The judge did consider the appellants in  relation  to  Article  8  and
    accepted that even if Article 8 was engaged an  interference  with  the
    rights was entirely proportionate.   The  judge  cited  Razgar  v  SSHD
    [2004] UKHL 27  and Huang v SSHD  [2007]  UKHL  11,  directing  himself
    appropriately and indicating that such  decisions  would  not  normally
    infringe Article  8  and  noted  that  the  appellants'  representative
    himself had conceded  that  the  appellants  could  not  succeed  under
    paragraph 276ADE.  It is not arguable that the judge failed to consider
    whether the appellants could reasonably return to Cameroon.

47. At paragraph 47 the judge found that there were  no  obstacles  to  the
    family returning to Cameroon and the family life of the appellants  was
    not engaged as all four would be returning as a family unit.  The judge
    also found that there was no evidence of any private life beyond  their
    family life.  Notwithstanding that, the judge stated that if Article  8
    was engaged then interference with those rights was  proportionate  for
    the reasons set out in Section  117A,  B  and  D  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act.   The judge simply found that there were no
    compelling circumstances in this case.

48. There is no indication that his views on the PhD infected his  analysis
    because there are no compelling factors. The judge was fully  aware  of
    the TA service (which did not  afford  the  family  ILR).   It  is  not
    apparent that he failed  to  take  it  into  account  as  he  proceeded
    thereafter to consider Article 8.  The family's leave had  always  been
    precarious and any such TA service would not become a  compelling  fact
    and failure to specifically identify it could not render this  decision
    in material legal error.  The judge made reference to precarious  leave
    not unlawful leave in his Article 8 assessment and made no reference to
    any finding of the PhD in his Article 8 assessment.

49. With regard to the health of the appellant, the judge clearly  did  not
    accept that the appellant was too ill  to  study  but  could  undertake
    physical activities in the TA (paragraph 30) and  I  am  not  persuaded
    that his approach to the medical evdience was unreasoned or  in  error.
    The judge found the medical  evdience  to  be  scant.  The  judge  also
    recorded the medical evidence in relation to  the  children  such  that
    there was no evidence of the serious skin condition which affected  his
    elder child and no up-to-date medical evidence,  the  last  being  22nd
    July 2015, as to the positional talipes of the younger child.   In  his
    conclusion the judge noted that there was no evidence of treatment  for
    the child with talipes since 15 January 2015.  It was open to the judge
    to conclude that the first appellant's medical problems were limited to
    treatment from over the counter analgesics for muscular pain and indeed
    that was the evdience that was given to him  by  the  appellant.    The
    judge rehearsed at length the provisions under Section 117 which he  is
    obliged to take into account, noting that the  appellant's  "family  is
    rich - his father owns hotels and other companies and sends  �2,500  to
    �3,500 to the appellant each month in cash", and further:  "There is no
    conceivable difficulty to the appellants or their children in a  return
    to Cameroon."

50. Although I find there may be some error in the judge  not  specifically
    signposting Section 55 this is not a material error as  this  provision
    was identified at the outset of the decision and the judge  had  it  in
    mind.  The children were not part of the appeal but the judge  applied,
    in essence, Beoku-Betts v SSHD [2008] UKHL 39 and at  paragraph  9  the
    judge noted that the best interests of the  children  are  an  integral
    part of the proportionality assessment and Article 8 and cited  Section
    55.

51. The judge was aware of the ages of the children and  found  the  family
    would return as a unit. Neither  of  these  children  is  a  qualifying
    child.  The judge applied the right test, noting that "if Article 8 was
    engaged then interference with those rights is  entirely  proportionate
    for the reasons set out in Section 117A, B and D  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and in Razgar".

52. The judge addressed the issue of the Secretary  of  State's  discretion
    and found no evidence of improper procedure.  His conclusions were open
    to him.

Notice of Decision

The First-tier Tribunal made no material  error  of  law  and  his  decision

Upper Tribunal Judge Rimington
