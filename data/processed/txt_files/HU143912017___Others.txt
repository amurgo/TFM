Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr S Shah, Legal Representative, 786 Law Associates
For the Respondent:    Mr P Deller, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. There are four appellants.  The first appellant, who was born on 26
    March 1980, is the mother of the other three, who were born
    respectively on 9 January 2003, 3 March 2004 and 29 August 2006.  The
    appellants are citizens of Pakistan.  They applied for leave to remain
    in the UK on the basis of their private and family life and their
    application was refused.  They appealed to the First-tier Tribunal and
    their appeal was determined on the papers at Bradford by Judge Ince
    who, in a decision promulgated on 2 March 2018, dismissed the appeal.
    The appellants are now appealing against that decision.

 2. The parties are in agreement that the decision of the First-tier
    Tribunal contains a material error of law such that the appeal should
    be heard afresh.  The reason for this agreement, in summary, is that
    the judge appears to not have had before him - and to have determined
    the appeal without having regard to - evidence adduced by the
    appellants that was material to the appeal.   The judge stated that
    "all that is before me is the notice of refusal and the notices and
    grounds of appeal."   However, it is plain from the file that there was
    a bundle of evidence submitted by the appellants concerning the private
    and family life of the children.

 3. Mr Deller noted that the appeal of the father of the family had been
    separated from the other appeals and this may account for why an
    incomplete picture was before the First-tier Tribunal.  In any event,
    irrespective of the reason why the relevant documents were not
    considered by the judge, and as agreed by Mr Deller, the failure to
    consider the evidence constitutes an error of law which renders the
    decision unsafe such that it will need to be heard afresh.

 4. Mr Shah argued that because of the length of time the children have
    been in the UK I should remake the appeal in their favour without
    hearing further evidence.  I do not accept this submission.  There are
    a range of factors that need to be considered and the fact that the
    children have been in the UK for over seven years is an important, but
    by no means determinative, consideration.  Therefore the matter will
    need to be heard afresh with up to date evidence concerning the
    children submitted in order for their rights under Article 8 ECHR to be
    evaluated.

 5. Given that there has not been a proper consideration by the First-tier
    Tribunal of the appellants' appeal this matter should be remitted to
    the First-tier Tribunal to be heard afresh.

     Decision

       a. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains a material error
          of law and is set aside.




       b. The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be heard
          afresh by a different judge of the First-tier Tribunal.






Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs otherwise, the appellants are
granted anonymity.  No report of these proceedings shall directly or
indirectly identify them or any member of their family.  This direction
applies both to the appellants and to the respondent.  Failure to comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
