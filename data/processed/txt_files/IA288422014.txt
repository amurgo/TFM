Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

      1. The appellant is a national of Nigeria, born in  1984  and  now  31
         years old.  He was last admitted to the United Kingdom in  February
         2011 and granted leave as a Tier 1 (post-study work) Migrant  valid
         until 12th February 2013.

      2. In January 2013, the appellant made an application for a  residence
         card  pursuant  to  the  Immigration   (European   Economic   Area)
         Regulations 2006, based on his marriage to a French national who he
         said was exercising Treaty  rights  in  the  United  Kingdom.   The
         marriage took place just a few weeks earlier, in December 2012, the
         wife stating her occupation to be 'babysitter'. His application was
         refused on 3rd June 2013 because the Secretary  of  State  was  not
         satisfied that the sponsor was exercising Treaty rights as a  self-
         employed person.  In  June  2013,  the  appellant  made  a  further
         application which was refused on 14th  August  2013  for  the  same
         reason.  There was no challenge to  the  respondent's  decision  on
         either of the 2013 applications.

      3. The application which is the subject  of  this  appeal,  the  third
         application by this appellant, was made in January 2014 and refused
         on 26th June 2014 refused on the single basis that the Secretary of
         State was not satisfied that the sponsor was  a  qualified  person,
         the third time that issue had  been  raised  on  the  same  factual
         matrix.

      4. In her refusal letter, the respondent accepted that the sponsor was
         making national insurance contributions but was not satisfied  that
         the bank statements provided showed payments from  her  jobs  as  a
         babysitter and/or  cleaner  or  that  there  was  sufficient  other
         evidence to support her claimed self-employment.

    First-tier Tribunal appeal

      5. The appellant appealed, electing for his appeal to be considered on
         the papers. In his notice of appeal he gave an address in  Cuthbert
         Road.  At the end of July 2014, it appears that the applicant moved
         to a different address, in Lincoln Road.  He  did  not  inform  the
         First-tier Tribunal of his change of address until 2  August  2014.
         A handwritten letter to that effect is produced with the grounds of
         appeal, but there is no record, either  electronically  or  on  the
         Tribunal file, of the receipt of such a document.

      6. On 3 September 2014 the First-tier Tribunal served on the appellant
         at his Cuthbert Road address, notice that his appeal was shortly to
         be considered by the Tribunal and that  any  written  evidence  and
         submissions on which he sought to rely should be received not later
         than 1 October 2014. The letter was returned by the postal  service
         on 4 September 2014, endorsed  "please  return  to  sender,  person
         named has moved out of property".

      7. On 2 October 2014, the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  considered  the
         appeal on the papers.  Her determination was prepared on 6  October
         2014.  The appellant  states  that  he  telephoned  the  First-tier
         Tribunal enquiring as to the status of his  appeal,  on  3  October
         2014, and was told that it was already before a judge.   At  13:33,
         according to the Tribunal file, the applicant  fax  confirming  his
         change of address. On any view, therefore, by 6 October 2014,  when
         the judge finalised her determination, the  Tribunal  (if  not  the
         judge) was aware of the change of address.

      8. In her determination the Judge  indicated  her  surprise  that  the
         appellant had not provided any evidence  from  his  wife's  clients
         which  might  have  clarified  entries  in  her  bank  account  and
         supported her account of the income relied upon  to  establish  the
         exercise of Treaty rights.  The appellant's wife had  not  attended
         the hearing or  provided  any  witness  statement  to  support  his
         application. She dismissed the appeal.

    Upper Tribunal appeal

      9. In his Grounds of Appeal the  appellant  stated  that  he  had  not
         received the notice of paper consideration and asserted  that,  had
         he received the letter of 3 September 2013, further evidence of the
         sponsor's exercise of Treaty rights would  have  been  produced  to
         support his case.  Permission to appeal was granted  on  the  basis
         that it was  arguable  there  may  have  been  a  procedural  error
         resulting in an unfair hearing.

     10. On 29 May 2015, notice of hearing was served on  the  Lincoln  Road
         address by the Upper Tribunal sent notice  of  the  present  appeal
         hearing to the appellant at the updated address he gave, in Lincoln
         Road.  The appellant neither responded nor  attended  the  hearing.
         We are satisfied that he was properly served  with  the  notice  of
         hearing and has given no reasonable explanation  for  his  absence.
         We proceeded to hear the appeal in his absence, pursuant to rule 38
         of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.

     11. We approach this appeal  taking  the  appellant's  account  at  its
         highest, and assuming that the letter of 2 August 2014 was sent  to
         the First-tier Tribunal but not recorded or linked to the file.  In
         any event, by the time the judge finalised her decision, the  Upper
         Tribunal was on notice of the earlier change of address.

     12. On that basis, applying the principles in E  &  R  v  Secretary  of
         State for the Home Department [2004] EWCA Civ  49,  the  First-tier
         Tribunal  was  on  notice  that  the  appellant  had  not  had   an
         opportunity to submit further  evidence.   We  are  satisfied  that
         there was a material error of law, as set out in MM (unfairness;  E
         & R) Sudan [2014] UKUT 00105 (IAC) and that it  is  appropriate  to
         set aside the First-tier Tribunal decision and  proceed  to  remake
         it, pursuant to section  12(2)(b)  of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and
         Enforcement Act 2007.

    Evidence before the Upper Tribunal

     13. The appellant produced a substantial bundle of documents (over  300
         pages), including a  number  of  receipts  and  invoices  which  he
         contends were created by the sponsor through  her  self-employment,
         together  with  business  insurance  documents  relating   to   the
         sponsor's  self-employment,  which  covered  her   business   until
         September 2014, and a number of advertisements  for  her  business,
         with dates in 2013 and 2014. There was  evidence  of  a  number  of
         National Insurance payments, in relatively  small  amounts,  and  a
         letter from her accountants accompanied  by  a  draft  tax  return,
         purporting to declare taxable profits of ï¿½7,342 up  to  31st  March
         2014.  There was no direct evidence from the Inland Revenue  as  to
         the sponsor's declared income and no up to date evidence about  her
         employment.  There is still no witness statement or letter from the
         sponsor herself, supporting the application.

     14. In submissions for the respondent, Miss Isherwood noted that  there
         was no up-to-date evidence of  the  sponsor's  exercise  of  Treaty
         rights.  The appellant was aware that this was the  crucial  issue,
         since it had been the  reason  for  refusal  of  his  two  previous
         unchallenged EEA spouse applications.  Miss Isherwood  referred  us
         to the authority of Begum  (EEA  -  worker  -  jobseeker)  Pakistan
         [2011] UKUT 00275 in respect of what must be proved and the type of
         work and remuneration which can satisfy the requirements of the EEA
         Regulations. Miss Isherwood asked us to dismiss the appeal.

    Discussion

     15. The appellant has not taken any further interest  in  this  appeal,
         although notice of hearing has been correctly served on him at  his
         last known address.   He  did  not  provide  the  evidence  of  his
         spouse's exercise of Treaty rights with the application for an  EEA
         residence card, although he was aware how important  that  question
         had been in the two previous applications, and his spouse  has  not
         supported this application.

     16. Some evidence has  now  been  provided,  but  it  is  post-decision
         evidence and is not current:  the most recent document is  about  6
         months ago.  If the appellant  had  appeared,  with  his  wife,  to
         explain his  circumstances,  that  might  well  have  assisted  the
         Tribunal but he has chosen not to do so.

     17. The burden of showing that at the material times the EEA citizen is
         exercising Treaty rights is upon  the  appellant  and  we  are  not
         satisfied, on  this  evidence,  that  he  has  discharged  it.   We
         therefore remake the decision by dismissing the appellant's appeal.



Decision

The appellant's appeal is dismissed.
