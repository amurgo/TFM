For the Appellant:     Mr S Ahmed, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr I Jarvis, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant is a national of Sri Lanka born on 11 December 1988.   He
    appealed against the respondent's decision  dated  27  August  2015  to
    refuse him leave to remain in the UK as  a  Tier  4  (General)  Student
    under the points-based system and for  a  biometric  residence  permit.
    The appellant had applied on 12 November 2012.  The respondent  decided
    to remove the appellant from the UK with directions under Section 47 of
    the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act  2006.   The  reasons  were
    that the appellant had submitted a TOEIC certificate  from  Educational
    Testing Service (ETS) to the respondent and to his  sponsor  which,  it
    was alleged, was obtained by deception.   The  respondent  refused  the
    application under paragraph 322(1A) of the Immigration Rules HC 395, as
    amended.

2.   The appellant's appeal  was  dismissed  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Solly in a determination promulgated on 24 October 2016.

3.   The appellant appealed Judge Solly's decision.  On 24 March 2017 First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Gibb granted the appellant permission to appeal  on
    the basis that it was arguable that the judge had erred in her approach
    to the photographs of the appellant which appeared on  the  results  of
    his test certificates at Appendix  F1  and  F2  of  the  Home  Office's
    bundle.

4.   In a determination promulgated on 8  June  2017,  I  ruled  that  Judge
    Solly had materially erred in law in her approach to  the  photographs.
    She had chosen to make the photographs an issue in this  case  but  had
    not made the appellant aware of this.  The respondent had better copies
    of Appendices F1 and F2 on her  file  and  could  have  been  asked  to
    produced them in order to resolve the matter.  As this was not done,  I
    could not say that if the conclusions in  respect  of  the  photographs
    were removed, whether the judge's decision would have been the same.  I
    therefore set aside the judge's decision in  order  to  remake  it.   I
    adjourned the hearing to another date.

5.   The appellant's appeal came before me for hearing on 5 September  2017.
     The appellant gave oral evidence.

6.   Mr  Ahmed  relied  on  two  bundles  of  documents;  the  first  bundle
    consisted of  fourteen  pages  and  included  the  appellant's  witness
    statement dated 25  January  2016.   The  second  bundle  consisted  of
    sixteen pages and contained the appellant's statement dated 14  October
    2016.  He also relied on the Upper Tribunal's decision in SM and  Qadir
    v Secretary of State for the Home Department (ETS - Evidence  -  Burden
    of Proof) [2016] UKUT 00229 (IAC).

7.   Mr Jarvis  relied  on  Professor  Peter  French's  report  on  Forensic
    Speaker Comparison Tests Undertaken by ETS dated 20 April 2016, Project
    Fa�ade - Criminal Inquiry into Abuse of the TOEIC dated 5 May 2015  and
    the case of MA (ETS - TOEIC testing) Nigeria [2016] UKUT 450 (IAC)  (16
    September 2016).

8.   The appellant relied on his two statements dated 25  January  2016  and
    14 October 2016 as being true and accurate.

9.   The appellant said he took the two tests in the respondent's bundle  at
    F1 and F2.  He took the F1  test  on  18  September  2012.   It  was  a
    speaking test.   The  photograph  on  the  certificate  was  his.   The
    certificate at F2 was in respect of the test he  took  on  20  November
    2012.  The photograph on this certificate was his.

10.  He was referred to paragraph 9 of the  statement  he  had  made  on  14
    October 2016.  He said therein that following  the  completion  of  his
    Business Management course, he  enrolled  on  a  two  year  Diploma  in
    Management Studies at the Alyssa School in Birmingham as  evidenced  by
    the Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies dated 12 November 2012.  The
    Alyssa School was part of BIETTEC College and classes took place in the
    building next door.  He explained that there were two buildings next to
    each other.  The first building was the Alyssa School  and  the  second
    was BIETTEC College.  He studied for the Diploma in Business Management
    course at BIETTEC.  The Diploma in Management  Studies  course  was  to
    take place at the Alyssa School.  He took the tests on 18 September and
    20 November 2012 at the Alyssa Test Centre.

11.  He was then referred to paragraph 10 of the same statement  wherein  he
    had said that on 8 November 2013, he sat the International English  for
    Speakers of Other Languages  (IELTS)  -  Communicator  -  B2  test  and
    achieved a first class pass  in  Reading,  Writing  and  Listening,  as
    evidenced by the copy of the certificate and notice of  results  issued
    on 27 November 2013.  He also achieved a first class pass in the Spoken
    Examination as evidenced by  the  certificate  and  notice  of  results
    issued on 9 December 2013.  He  explained  that  he  took  these  tests
    because the first application he had made to the Home Office for  leave
    to  remain  in  November  2012  for  which  he  had  attached  a  TOEIC
    certificate had been refused by the Secretary of  State  on  the  basis
    that the TOEIC test had been taken  at  two  different  sittings.   The
    Secretary of State said that the tests should have been  taken  at  one
    sitting.  He explained that at the time he  made  his  application  the
    Immigration Rules did not require him to take the  TOEIC  test  at  one
    sitting.  The test comprised reading, listening, writing and  speaking.
    At the time he made his application there was no requirement  that  the
    test for each component should be taken at one sitting.  Because he had
    sat the test on two different dates, the Secretary of State refused his
    application.  The Rule requiring the component tests be  taken  on  the
    same date came into effect in October 2013.  This was not in  existence
    at the time of the decision by the respondent on 17 June 2013.

12.  The appellant was asked by Mr Ahmed if he used deception in  making  an
    application to the Home Office.  The appellant replied "No, not  to  my
    knowledge.  I took the test."  He said that he has always been  of  the
    understanding that his  application  would  be  refused  if  there  was
    deception and he knew of the consequences.

13.  In cross-examination,  the  appellant  was  referred  to  his  original
    statement dated 24 October 2013.  At paragraph  28  the  appellant  had
    accepted that the first attempt at the  speaking  examination  was  not
    successfully passed.  At paragraph  29  he  said  he  did  not  have  a
    reasonable explanation why he was not successful in his first  speaking
    exam, apart from the fact that he was worried and  nervous  before  and
    during the exam.  Similarly, he was worried how his pronunciation would
    be perceived and as such, he was extremely careful with  the  words  he
    used during the exam.

14.  The appellant said that at the time  of  the  tests  in  2012,  he  was
    living with his uncle in Coventry.  He travelled by bus to BIETTEC  and
    that journey took nearly an hour.  He travelled alone.  His uncle  knew
    he was travelling to take the tests.  After the tests, he spoke to  his
    uncle who asked him how the tests went and he said  he  did  everything
    well.  On 20 November 2012 when he was carrying out the  tests  he  did
    not recognise any student from his course.  He did not recognise any of
    the staff as staff from Alyssa or BIETTEC.  On 18 September 2012, there
    were two students from his course also taking the  test.   He  has  not
    been in contact with any of them for five years.  It  was  put  to  him
    that when he received his refusal on 17 June 2013, BIETTEC  was  closed
    down by then because of issues with the Home Office.  Alyssa School had
    also lost its licence.  The appellant said he was not  sure  when  this
    was.  He found out from BIETTEC that Alyssa had closed down.

15.  The appellant said he had no evidence that his solicitor had  requested
    the voice recording  from  the  Home  Office  or  tried  to  trace  the
    recording from ETS.  He thought  his  solicitor  had,  but  he  had  no
    evidence to support this.

16.  The appellant was referred to his bank statements at J1 and J2  of  the
    respondent's bundle.  He was also referred to  page  8  of  his  second
    bundle which was a payment plan he had set up with BIETTEC in September
    2011 to pay his tuition fees.  The  payment  plan  showed  that  on  18
    September 2012, he made a payment  of  �600  to  Sam  from  his  Lloyds
    account.  On 30 October 2012, he again paid Sam �600 by cheque.  It was
    put to him that at J2 there was no outgoing of �600  by  cheque  on  30
    October 2012.  The appellant said that the �1,750  transferred  to  his
    account on 9 October 2012 was  from  his  uncle  (Sakthi  Services  STA
    Chana).  This was a transfer from his  uncle's  business  account.   He
    withdrew the same amount in cash on 10 October 2012.  He explained that
    the �370 paid into his account on 29 October 2012 was  his  wages  from
    his uncle whom he was working with.  It was put to him that at the last
    hearing he had said in respect of the �1,750 that that was his  college
    fee.  He explained that about a month-and-a-half after the  hearing  he
    asked his uncle about the money.  His uncle told him that he  had  paid
    this money into his account by mistake.  That was why he took  out  the
    money in cash and gave it back to his uncle.  He said the  �300  was  a
    cheque that had cleared on 10 October  2012.   He  denied  that  having
    failed the speaking test, and being nervous and concerned about failing
    it again, someone had offered him a chance of taking it by proxy as the
    safest way of passing it.  He denied that he had paid  that  person  to
    make it happen and had withdrawn the �1,750 to make it happen.  He said
    that when he made his student application in Sri  Lanka,  he  took  the
    IELTS test at the British Council and got band  5  score  which  was  a
    pass.  He did not pay anyone to take the TOEIC test for him as  he  did
    not need to.  He failed the first test he sat on 18 September 2012.  On
    that occasion, he was scored 150.  On the second attempt on 20 November
    2012 he passed with a score of 170.

17.  Mr Jarvis said to him that the Secretary of State was  of  the  opinion
    that he used a proxy in both tests.  The printout at E1 from ETS showed
    both tests were invalid because he had used a proxy on both dates.  The
    appellant denied that he had used a proxy on both occasions.

18.  Mr Ahmed questioned the appellant  about  the  procedure  at  the  test
    centre.  He said he entered the test centre at  Alyssa.   In  September
    there were ten other students taking the tests.  He entered through the
    door and there was a supervisor who checked his name  on  his  passport
    and checked he was on the list  of  candidates  taking  the  tests.   A
    supervisor took his photograph.  He was then given a cubicle which  was
    number 7.  It had a computer in it.  He entered his personal details on
    the computer.  He put on his headphones and spoke into the computer for
    about one-and-a-half hours.  He said it was impossible for an  imposter
    to enter the test centre.  He went into  it  by  himself  and  was  not
    accompanied by anyone else.

19.  I put some questions to the appellant.  He  told  me  that  his  spoken
    English in 2012 was quite good.  He had passed the IELTS  test  at  the
    time he made his student application at the British High Commission  in
    Sri Lanka.  He said his solicitor had requested a  recording  from  ETS
    after the last hearing and was still chasing up ETS for  a  reply.    I
    said I would like to see documentary evidence from  the  solicitors  in
    respect of their requests to ETS.  I gave Mr Ahmed a week to submit the
    evidence.  Mr Jarvis said he wished to respond to the evidence when  he
    received it.

20.  I then heard submissions from both parties.  I  shall  incorporate  the
    submissions into my findings.


Findings

21.  The issue in this case is  whether  the  appellant  used  deception  by
    supporting the application he made on 20 November  2011  with  a  TOEIC
    certificate which he had obtained by use of  a  proxy.   At  the  first
    stage, the evidential burden is on the  respondent  to  establish  that
    there is prima facie evidence of deceit.  In  SM  &  Qadir,  the  Upper
    Tribunal found that  in  the  light  of  the  evidence  from  ETS,  the
    respondent had satisfied the legal burden on her.  I find this  is  the
    case here.

22.   The  second  stage  is  for  the  appellant  to  provide  a  plausible
    explanation. It is interesting to note that the two tests the appellant
    sat on 18 September 2012 and 20 November 2012 were declared invalid  by
    ETS.  It is interesting in the sense that he had  failed  the  speaking
    test taken on 18 September 2012, and yet that test  had  been  declared
    invalid.  I note that the appellant made his application to remain as a
    Tier 4 Student on 12 November 2012.  When he submitted his application,
    he had yet to sit the test on 20 November 2012.   I  therefore  presume
    that the TOEIC certificate from ETS which he had submitted to the  Home
    Office and to his sponsor,  that  is  Alyssa  School,  was  certificate
    number 00442022016034001 in respect of the test taken on  18  September
    2012.  By the time the respondent refused his application on 27  August
    2015, the  respondent  had  received  information  from  ETS  that  the
    speaking test the appellant had taken on 20 November 2012  was  invalid
    as it had been  taken  by  a  proxy.   It  was  on  the  basis  of  the
    information from  ETS  that  the  respondent  refused  the  appellant's
    application.

23.  The appellant's defence is that he did not use a proxy  and  there  was
    no need for him to.  This was because when he had made his  application
    for a student visa in Sri Lanka in 2010 he had sat the  IELTS  and  had
    the opportunity of speaking personally to a test officer at the British
    Council and had scored a band 5 which was a pass.  He had said  in  his
    original statement of 2013 that he was nervous and concerned about  his
    pronunciation and that may have led to an  unsuccessful  test.   I  can
    understand that he might have been nervous on  that  occasion,  but  it
    still does not explain why he would fail the test taken on 18 September
    2012 when he had been in the UK since 5 September  2010  and  had  been
    interacting with English speaking people for two years prior to  taking
    the test.  Mr Ahmed questioned why the appellant did not pass the  test
    if he had used a proxy on 18 September.  He said it  was  unusual  that
    the respondent was challenging the validity of a  failed  test.   I  do
    not, in my opinion, believe that the  respondent  was  challenging  the
    result of the test. Because of the evidence from  ETS,  the  respondent
    took the view the appellant had employed a proxy to take  the  test  on
    his behalf.  The fact that he  failed  that  test  was  not  of  itself
    evidence that the appellant took the test himself.

24.  Mr Jarvis relied on the Home Office Project Fa�ade -  Criminal  Inquiry
    into Abuse of the TOEIC, in particular at the Birmingham  Institute  of
    Education, Training and Technology (BIETTEC).  A criminal  inquiry  was
    into the various test centres.  The report highlighted  the  difference
    between invalid and questionable TOEIC results.  Invalid  results  were
    where evidence exists of proxy test  taking  and/or  impersonation  and
    questionable meant that test takers who should retake the test  due  to
    administrative irregularities.  Paragraph 6 of the report recorded that
    between  11  April  2011  and  9  February  2014  public  test  centres
    (Bloomsbury and Westminster) undertook 1,039 TOEIC speaking and writing
    tests, of which ETS identified  that  three  were  invalid,  none  were
    questionable and  the  percentage  of  invalid  tests  was  0.28%.   In
    comparison, the level of cheating found at the majority of private test
    centres was significant; in one case 88% of the tests taken were  found
    to be invalid.  In some of the private test centres the number of tests
    invalidated was in the thousands.  In the report by  Rebecca  Collings,
    she said at paragraph 28 that ETS described that any tests  categorised
    as cancelled (which later became known as invalid) had the  same  voice
    for multiple test takers questioning ETS advised that they were certain
    there was evidence of proxy  test  taking  or  impersonation  in  those
    cases.  Following further communication with  ETS  they  confirmed  the
    definition of "questionable" as set out in Peter  Millington's  witness
    statement.  It is where an individual's test result was still cancelled
    on the basis of tests administration irregularity, including  the  fact
    that the test was taken at a UK  testing  centre  when  numerous  other
    results have been invalidated on the  basis  of  a  "match".   ETS  had
    analysed over 10,000 test scores at that point, of which  the  majority
    were  cancelled  as  invalid,   the   remainder   were   cancelled   as
    questionable. I rely on this evidence  as  it  particularly  refers  to
    BIETEC, the test centre where the appellant took his tests.

25.  I note that two months later, on 20 November 2012,  the  appellant  sat
    another test and passed it but not by a very large margin.   I  had  no
    evidence as to what he did to prepare for the second test.  Even if  he
    had sat the first test himself, I am not persuaded that he  would  have
    passed  the  second  test  two  months  later  without  help.   In  the
    circumstances, I am not persuaded by his evidence that he sat the tests
    himself.

26.  I gave the appellant seven days to submit evidence from his  solicitors
    that they had made enquiries with ETS about his test  results.   As  at
    the time of having this determination promulgated, I had  not  received
    any such evidence from the appellant or  his  solicitors.   I  draw  an
    adverse inference from this omission and conclude that no such evidence
    exists because no enquiries were made by his solicitors.

27.  In MA  (ETS  -  TOEIC  testing)  Nigeria  [2016]  UKUT  450  (IAC)  (16
    September 2016), the Tribunal held at paragraph 57 that:-

     "... we acknowledge the suggestion that the Appellant had no reason  to
         engage in the deception which we have found proven.  However,  this
         has not deflected us in any way from reaching our main findings and
         conclusions.  In the abstract, of  course,  there  is  a  range  of
         reasons why persons proficient  in  English  may  engage  in  TOEIC
         fraud.  These include, inexhaustively, lack of confidence, fear  of
         failure,  lack  of  time  and  commitment  and  contempt  for   the
         immigration system.  These reasons  could  conceivably  overlap  in
         individual cases and there is  scope  for  other  explanations  for
         deceitful conduct in this sphere.  We are not required to make  the
         further finding of why the Appellant engaged in  deception  and  to
         this we add that this issue was not explored  during  the  hearing.
         We resist any temptation to speculate about this discrete matter."

28.  I take account of the appellant's evidence that he travelled  alone  to
    the test centre and gave a detailed account of  his  journey.   I  find
    that this adds little weight to his case as  he  had  studied  in  that
    building for about a year and would have been familiar with the journey
    to the test centre.

29.  I have also taken into  account  the  appellant's  evidence  about  the
    procedure at the test centre.  In the light of the evidence  thrown  up
    by the criminal investigations into the abuse of TOEIC at  BIETTEC  and
    the conclusions drawn by Professor French in his  report  of  20  April
    2016, I find that it is conceivable that  the  procedure  at  the  test
    centre was not full proof.

30.  Mr Ahmed questioned why the appellant would  use  another  proxy  if  a
    proxy failed the first test.  I have no answer to this question  and  I
    would be speculating if I said I had.  In court, he spoke English  well
    but this is five years after the results of the tests that he  took  in
    2012.  I accept that he passed the test in 2013 but  this  was  a  year
    after the failed tests.  Mr Ahmed's submission  that  in  MA  paragraph
    48(v) the Tribunal held that the applicant's TOEIC certificate dated 28
    February 2013 was not the product of any test undertaken on  that  date
    and any occasion or at all because of the absence of  a  photograph  of
    the first of the two TOEIC certificates.  In this case I found that the
    photograph on each of the appellant's two test certificates was of him.
     However, I am in agreement with Mr  Jarvis'  submission  that  nothing
    turns on the photographs because it  is  possible  that  the  appellant
    colluded with people in the college to engage in  the  deception.   The
    appellant has not provided any evidence from his solicitors  that  they
    made enquiries with ETS  about  his  tests,  despite  being  given  the
    opportunity to do so.

31.  I turn to the issue of the appellant's finances.  At J1 and J2  of  the
    respondent's bundle is the appellant's bank statement from  his  Lloyds
    Bank account from 2 October 2012 to 5  November  2012.   The  statement
    shows that on 9 October 2012 �1,750 was transferred into his account by
    Sakthi Services.  On 10 October 2012 that amount was withdrawn from the
    appellant's account.  I bear in mind that his appeal was heard by First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Solly on 18  October  2016,  eight  days  after  he
    withdrew the money.  He told Judge Solly that the �1,750 was a  college
    fee that he paid by cheque.  At the hearing before me he said that  his
    uncle had mistakenly paid �1,750 into his account and the withdrawal on
    10 October was to give the money back to his uncle.  The explanation he
    had given today was the explanation given to him by his uncle after  he
    had questioned his uncle about the money.  I do not believe him.  There
    was no evidence from the uncle to support his evidence.   If  that  was
    the explanation given to him by his uncle, I question why  he  did  not
    give this explanation to Judge Solly.

32.  At page 8  of  his  second  bundle  was  a  payment  plan  between  the
    appellant and BIETTEC to pay his tuition  fees.   The  start  date  was
    September 2011.  It showed that on 18 September 2012 he had  paid  �600
    to Sam, on 30 October 2012 he had again paid  �600  to  Sam  and  on  5
    November 2012 had  paid  �250  to  Sam.   None  of  these  payments  is
    reflected in his bank statement.  His bank statement showed  that  �300
    was debited from his account on 15 October 2012.   He  had  told  Judge
    Solly that the �300 was a cheque for  a  college  fee.   I  accept  the
    appellant's evidence that payment  of  �370  into  his  account  on  20
    October 2012 represented his wages.  Other than these two  payments,  I
    do not accept that the appellant has been  entirely  honest  about  his
    finances.

33.  Having  considered  all  the  evidence  before  me,  I  find  that  the
    respondent has discharged the legal burden on her in proving  that  the
    appellant obtained the certificate on 20 November 2012 by deception.
