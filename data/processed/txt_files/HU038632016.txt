                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction


 1. The appellant is a national of Jamaica born on 10 January 1970. She has
    been granted permission to appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  against  a
    decision of Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  ("FtT")  Sangha  who,
    following a hearing on 6 October 2016, dismissed her appeal  under  the
    Immigration Rules and on human rights grounds against a decision of the
    respondent of 28 January 2016 to refuse her application  for  leave  to
    remain in the United Kingdom as the spouse of a Mr  Paul  Gordon  David
    Colman and to give directions under section 10 of the  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 1999 (the "1999  Act")  for  her  removal  from  the  United
    Kingdom.

 2. The appellant arrived in the United Kingdom on 29  November  1999  with
    six months' leave as a visitor. Her in-time application for leave as  a
    student and subsequent out-of-time applications for leave on the  basis
    of Article 8 and as a spouse were refused. She has  therefore  remained
    in the United Kingdom without leave since May/June 2000.  The  decision
    of 28 January 2016 that was the subject of the appeal to  the  FtT  was
    the third decision refusing to grant leave to remain as a  spouse.  The
    appellant met her husband-to-be in 2012. He is a British citizen.  They
    were married on 9 August 2013. Her husband has two adult  children  who
    live separately. His father requires care which the appellant provides.



 3. The issues before the judge were as follows:

    i)      In relation to Appendix FM of the  Immigration  Rules,  whether
        there were  insurmountable  obstacles  to  the  appellant  and  her
        husband relocating to Jamaica to enjoy their family life together.

    ii)     In relation to para 276ADE(1)(vi)  of  the  Immigration  Rules,
        whether there were very significant obstacles  to  the  appellant's
        reintegration in Jamaica.

    iii)    In relation to the Article 8 claim outside the  Rules,  whether
        the appellant's removal would be in breach of Article 8.

The judge's decision

 4. The judge considered the evidence before him at para 18 onwards of  his
    decision.   His  findings,  and  reasons  for  his  findings,  may   be
    summarised as follows:

    i)      There were no insurmountable obstacles to the appellant and her
        husband relocating to Jamaica to enjoy family life  (paras  20-22).
        In  reaching  this  decision,  the  judge  took  into  account  the
        following:

            a)   The appellant's evidence  that  she  was  caring  for  her
             father-in-law and a friend in the United Kingdom. He noted that
             the appellant's father-in-law was entitled to  assistance  from
             social services in respect of his care but he did not want such
             assistance because he did not like paying  for  it.  The  judge
             found that such assistance was clearly available to the father-
             in-law whether as a matter of personal choice he wanted  it  or
             not. The appellant was providing the care out of preference and
             not necessity (para 20).

            b)   The appellant's evidence that she had  been  supported  by
             her aunt when she lived in Jamaica, that  none  of  her  family
             live in Jamaica any longer and that she had never worked whilst
             in Jamaica. The judge found her evidence in this respect to  be
             lacking in credibility (para 20).

            c)   The judge also  noted  the  evidence  of  the  appellant's
             husband that he was aware of the appellant's immigration status
             before they were married (para 21).

            d)   The evidence of the appellant's husband who  said  he  was
             self-employed in the construction industry and  that  he  would
             not be able to relocate to Jamaica because  he  would  have  to
             leave all of his family behind in the United Kingdom, including
             his two grown up children and his elderly  father  who  was  in
             need of care (para 21). At para 26, the  judge  said  that  her
             husband's evidence that he would not be  able  to  relocate  to
             Jamaica was an expression of preference.

            e)   At para 22, the judge considered the appellant's  evidence
             that her British citizen husband is in full time  employment  /
             self-employment, that  they  have  their  home  in  the  United
             Kingdom, that they are living together and that it would  cause
             disruption to their lives if she were  required  to  return  to
             Jamaica in order to apply for entry clearance or if her husband
             were to relocate to Jamaica with her.

      ii)   The judge said that, from  the  evidence  before  him,  he  was
        satisfied that there were no  very  significant  obstacles  to  the
        appellant's reintegration into Jamaica (para 21).  He  had  earlier
        stated, at para 20, that he found the appellant's evidence that she
        had never worked in Jamaica, that she had lived in Jamaica with her
        aunt and that she no  longer  has  family  in  Jamaica  lacking  in
        credibility.

    iii)    The judge said, at paras 21, 22, 25, 26 and 29,  that,  in  the
        alternative, the appellant had the option of returning  to  Jamaica
        temporarily in order to make an application  for  entry  clearance,
        that it was more than likely that they would  be  separated  for  a
        short while only and that during the period of their separation she
        could continue to communicate with her husband by modern  means  of
        communication. At para 26, he said that the appellant would be able
        to re-establish herself in Jamaica for a short period  of  time  in
        order to apply for entry clearance. In reaching  this  finding,  he
        took into account the appellant's evidence that she  did  not  have
        family in Jamaica. He noted that she was 29 years old when she came
        to the United Kingdom and had therefore spent the major part of her
        life in Jamaica including her formative years and that  she  speaks
        English. He noted that the appellant's husband  had  said  that  he
        would support the appellant's application for entry  clearance,  at
        paragraph 26. At para 29. He noted  that  appellant's  husband  was
        earning ï¿½22,000  per  annum,  and  therefore  the  appellant  would
        satisfy the financial requirements for entry clearance in order  to
        rejoin her spouse.

 5. The above summary is drawn from paras 18-30  of  the  judge's  decision
    which read:


      "My Findings of Fact and Conclusions


      18.   On examination of the evidence I find  that  the  Appellant  was
        born on 10 January 1970 and is a citizen of Jamaica.


      19.   The Appellant entered the UK on 29 November 1999 with a 6  month
        visitor's visa. On 23 May 2000 the Appellant applied for  leave  to
        remain as a student but that application was refused  on  4  August
        2000.  The  Appellant  thus  became  an  overstayer.  Although  the
        Appellant  subsequently  made  various  applications  in  order  to
        regularise  her  stay  in  the  UK,  all  those  applications  were
        unsuccessful. The evidence before me is that the Appellant met Paul
        Gordon  David  Colman,  a  British  citizen,  in  2012   and   they
        established a relationship and they got married on  9  August  2013
        and this is evidenced by a copy of the Marriage  Certificate  which
        appears before  me  at  page  9  of  the  Appellant's  bundle.  The
        Appellant's husband has admitted in his evidence that he was  aware
        of the Appellant's immigration status before they got  married.  It
        would appear that on 25 February 2014  the  Appellant  applied  for
        leave to remain under the Family and Private Life  Rules  but  that
        application was refused on 16 April  2014.  On  7  April  2015  the
        Appellant applied  for  leave  to  remain  as  a  spouse  but  that
        application was rejected on 18 June 2015. On  27  August  2015  the
        Appellant applied  for  leave  to  remain  as  a  spouse  but  that
        application was rejected on 3 November 2015. On  19  December  2015
        the Appellant applied for leave to remain in the UK on Form  FLR(M)
        on the basis of her relationship with her husband Paul Gordon David
        Colman and the fact that she had been residing in  the  UK  for  16
        years and that she cared for her father in law and a family friend.
        Her application for leave to remain was on the basis of her  family
        and private life in the UK. That application  was  refused  by  the
        Home Office by their letter dated 28 January 2016.


      20.   The issue in this  case  is  whether  there  are  insurmountable
        obstacles for the Appellant and Sponsor relocating to Jamaica.  The
        burden of proof is on the Appellant. The Appellant was 29 years  of
        age when she entered the UK and her evidence was that she had  been
        living with an aunt. She says that none of her family now reside in
        Jamaica and that  they  are  either  in  the  USA  or  Canada.  The
        Appellant also said that she had never worked whilst in Jamaica and
        that she had been  supported  by  her  aunt.  However  I  find  her
        evidence  in  that  respect  to  be  lacking  in  credibility.  The
        Appellant also claims that she is caring for her husband's  elderly
        father and also for a friend Miss Latchman although the Appellant's
        husband has two grown up children. There was  also  evidence  given
        before me that although the Appellant's father in law  is  entitled
        to assistance from Social Services in respect of his care, that  he
        does not want it because he does not like paying for it. However, I
        find that Social Services assistance is clearly  available  to  the
        Appellant's father in law whether he, as a matter of choice,  wants
        it or not. The fact that the Appellant is providing  that  care  is
        out of preference and not, it seems to me, out of necessity.


      21.   I heard evidence from the Appellant's husband, who admitted that
        he knew his wife's immigration status before they got married.  The
        Appellant's husband is self- employed in the construction  industry
        and claims that he would not be able to relocate to Jamaica because
        he would have to leave all his  family  behind  including  his  two
        grown up children and his elderly father who is in  need  of  care.
        The Respondent's case is that all these factors do not prevent  the
        Appellant and her husband from relocating to Jamaica to enjoy their
        family life together or alternatively for the Appellant  to  return
        to Jamaica in order to apply for  entry  clearance  to  rejoin  her
        husband  in  the  UK.  The  Respondent's  case  is  that   although
        relocating to Jamaica may  cause  a  degree  of  hardship  for  the
        Appellant, her husband and other family members that there  was  no
        evidence to  show  that  there  was  any  insurmountable  obstacles
        preventing them from continuing their relationship in Jamaica.  The
        Respondent's case  is  that  the  Appellant  did  not  satisfy  the
        requirements of paragraph EX.1(b) of the  Rules  and  nor  did  the
        Respondent consider that the  Appellant  met  the  requirements  of
        paragraph 276 ADE of the Rules and that it is clear  that  she  has
        not been resident in the UK for more than 20 years  and,  from  the
        evidence before me, I am satisfied that there is little evidence to
        show  that  there  would  be  very  significant  obstacles  to  the
        Appellant's integration into Jamaica if she were required to  leave
        the UK. On the evidence before me I  agree  with  the  Respondent's
        assessment in this respect.


      22.   The basis of the Appellant's Application  is  that  her  British
        husband is in full time employment/self-employment  and  that  they
        have their home and that they are living together. Her case is that
        it would cause disruption to their lives if she  were  required  to
        return to Jamaica in order to apply for entry clearance  or  indeed
        for her and her husband to relocate to Jamaica. In my assessment of
        the evidence, the Appellant has not  demonstrated  that  there  are
        very significant obstacles preventing the Appellant or her  British
        partner from relocating to Jamaica to enjoy their  family  life  or
        indeed alternatively for her to return to  Jamaica  temporarily  in
        order to apply for entry clearance in the proper manner to join her
        husband in the UK.  Whilst  the  Appellant  and  her  husband  have
        established a family life here, it was their own  choice  to  marry
        and live in the circumstances they have chosen to do. The Appellant
        and her husband both knew the Appellant's  immigration  status  was
        precarious when they chose to enter into their marriage. They  will
        have known that they would have had to comply with the requirements
        of the Immigration Rules for the purpose of entry clearance to  the
        UK. The Appellant's immigration status in the UK  has  always  been
        precarious since she overstayed because it depended  on  her  being
        granting further leave to remain which is evidenced by the  various
        applications that the Appellant has made since she has been  living
        here. Whilst I can understand that the Appellant and her  husband's
        desire for her to remain in the UK, I am  required  to  assess  the
        Appellant's case in accordance with the UK's Immigration  Laws.  On
        the evidence before  me  I  cannot  accept  that  the  Respondent's
        decision is in any way disproportionate  in  the  circumstances  of
        this particular case. Whilst I note  that  Miss  Reid  argued  that
        there were significant obstacles for the Appellant and her  husband
        to be able to enjoy their family life outside the UK, I  find  that
        there is nothing to stop the Appellant from returning to Jamaica in
        order to make an application for  entry  clearance  in  the  proper
        manner and during that time she could continue to communicate  with
        her husband by modern means of communication and they are more than
        likely to be separated for only a short while.


      23.   In the assessment of this case I have  taken  into  account  the
        Upper Tribunal's decision in R (on the Application of Chen) v. SSHD
        (Appendix FM Chikwamba - Temporary  Separation  -  Proportionality)
        IJR [2015] UKUT 189 (IAC).


      24.   In the Chen case it was held:


           "(i)  Appendix FM does not include consideration of the question
            whether it would be disproportionate to expect an individual to
            return  to  his  home  country  to  make  an  entry   clearance
            application to rejoin family members in the UK.  There  may  be
            cases in which there are no insurmountable obstacles to  family
            life being  enjoyed  outside  the  UK  but  where  a  temporary
            separation to enable an individual to make an  application  for
            entry clearance may be disproportionate. In all cases, it  will
            be for the individual to place before the  Secretary  of  State
            evidence  that  such  temporary   separation   will   interfere
            disproportionately with  protective  rights.  It  will  not  be
            enough to rely solely upon the case law concerning Chikwamba v.
            SSHD [2008] UKHR 40.


           (ii)  Lord Brown was not  laying  down  a  legal  test  when  he
            suggested in Chikwamba that requiring the claimant to  make  an
            application  for  entry  clearance  would  only  "comparatively
            rarely" be proportionate in a case involving children  (Burnett
            j as he then was, in R (Kotecha & Das) v. SSHD [2011] EWHC 2070
            (Admin)).


           (iii) In an application for leave on the basis of an  Article  8
            claim, the Secretary  of  State  is  not  obliged  to  consider
            whether an application for entry clearance (if one were  to  be
            made) would be successful. Accordingly,  her  silence  on  this
            issue does not mean that it is accepted  the  requirements  for
            entry clearance to be granted are satisfied.


           (iv)  In cases where the Immigration Rules (the  "IRs")  do  not
            fully address an Article  8  claim  so  that  it  is  necessary
            (pursuant to R (Nagre)) to consider the claim outside the  IRs,
            a failure by the Decision Maker to consider Article  8  outside
            the IRs will only render the decision unlawful if the  Claimant
            in  fact  shows  that  there  has  been  or,  in  a  permission
            application (arguably has been) a substantive breach of his  or
            her rights under Article 8".

      25.   In my assessment  this  Appellant  has  not  placed  any  cogent
        evidence before me that a temporary separation from her UK  Sponsor
        by returning to Jamaica to make an application for entry  clearance
        in the proper manner would interfere  disproportionately  with  her
        protected Article 8 rights. I do not accept that the Appellant  and
        her husband cannot  maintain  their  family  life  if  she  returns
        temporarily to Jamaica to make an application for  entry  clearance
        in the proper manner. I am satisfied that  the  Appellant  and  her
        husband could continue to maintain  contact  with  one  another  by
        modern means of communication whilst  she  temporarily  returns  to
        Jamaica to make an application for entry clearance  in  the  proper
        manner. Consequently I  do  not  accept  that  there  will  be  any
        disproportionate  interference  with  the  Appellant  and  the   UK
        sponsor's private and family life by  their  temporary  separation.
        The circumstances placed before me are not, in  my  assessment,  so
        exceptional to  warrant  a  grant  of  leave  to  remain  for  this
        Appellant outside the Rules.


      26.   In assessing this case I have also taken into account the public
        interest provisions of Section 117 A -  B  of  the  2002  Act.  The
        public interest in the maintenance of effective immigration control
        is engaged. There is no  infringement  of  the  "English  speaking"
        public interest as the Appellant speaks  English.  The  Appellant's
        husband is economically self-sufficient as he is self-employed. The
        Appellant is, as I have found, an overstayer and any  private  life
        established since then or a relationship formed with  a  qualifying
        partner established  whilst  the  Appellant  has  been  in  the  UK
        unlawfully, is to be given little weight. Little weight  is  to  be
        given to private life established by a person at a  time  when  the
        person's immigration state is precarious. The  fact  that  although
        the Appellant claimed that she does not have any family in  Jamaica
        does not, in my assessment mean  that  that  there  would  be  very
        significant obstacles to the Applicant's integration  into  Jamaica
        if required to leave the UK. The Appellant was 29 years of age when
        she came to the UK and spent the  major  part  of  her  life  there
        including her formative years. She speaks English. Just as she  was
        able to establish herself in the UK I find that she would  be  able
        to re-establish herself in Jamaica for a short period  of  time  in
        order to apply for entry clearance to  return  to  the  UK  in  the
        normal way. Whilst I note the  Appellant's  husband  gave  evidence
        that he would not be able to relocate  to  Jamaica  with  his  wife
        because he would be leaving his family here, I find that that is an
        expression of preference and does not, in my assessment, amount  to
        "very significant obstacles" to the  Appellant's  integration  into
        the country to which she would have to go if required to leave  the
        UK. There has been no evidence put before me to demonstrate why the
        Appellant would not be able to return to Jamaica  for  a  temporary
        period of time and to apply for entry clearance to return to the UK
        to rejoin her husband. Her husband has said that he  would  support
        such an  application.  In  my  assessment  the  Appellant  and  her
        husband's circumstances here do not outweigh  the  public  interest
        provisions.


      27.   In the assessment of this appeal I have taken into  account  the
        cases of AM (S.117B [2015] UKUT 260 (IAC) and Forman  (SS117A  -  C
        Considerations) [2015] UKUT 412 (IAC) where it was stated:-


             "(i) The public interest in firm immigration  control  is  not
             diluted by the consideration that a person  pursuing  a  claim
             under Article 8 has at no time been a financial burden on  the
             state  or  is  self-sufficient  or  is  likely  to  remain  so
             indefinitely. The significance of these factors is that  where
             they are not present the public interest is fortified.


             (ii)      The list of considerations contained in Section 117B
             and Section 117C... is not exhaustive.  Tribunal  entitled  to
             take into  account  other  considerations  provided  they  are
             relevant in bearing the public interest.


             (iii) In cases where the provisions of Sections 117B - 117C...
             arise, the decision of the Tribunal must demonstrate that they
             have been given full effect".


      28.   I have also considered the case of SSHD v. SS (Congo  &  Others)
        [2015] EWCA in which it was stated at paragraph 51:


                  "... the approach to Article 8 in the light of  the  Rules
            in Appendix FM - SE should be the same as  in  respect  of  the
            substantive leave  to  enter  and  leave  to  remain  rules  in
            Appendix FM. In other words, the same general position applies,
            that compelling circumstances would have to apply to justify  a
            grant of leave to enter or leave to remain where  the  evidence
            rules are not complied with".


      29.   I note that the Appellant's husband is earning ï¿½22,000 per annum
        and  therefore  the   Appellant   would   satisfy   the   financial
        requirements of the Immigration Rules when she  applies  for  entry
        clearance to rejoin her husband in the UK.


      30.   In all the circumstances therefore I  find  that  the  Appellant
        fails to meet the requirements of Appendix EX.1(b) or paragraph 276
        ADE (1) (vi) of the Rules. I also find  in  all  the  circumstances
        that the Respondent's decision is not  a  disproportionate  measure
        and therefore does not, in my assessment, contravene Article  8  of
        the ECHR."

The grounds

 6. The judge erred in finding  that  there  was  nothing  to  prevent  the
    appellant from returning  to  Jamaica  to  apply  for  entry  clearance
    because the  Upper  Tribunal  had  confirmed  in  Chen  that  temporary
    separation may be disproportionate even if there were no insurmountable
    obstacles to  family  life  continue  permanently  outside  the  United
    Kingdom.

 7. In reaching his decision that there were no insurmountable obstacles to
    the appellant and her husband returning to Jamaica whilst the appellant
    makes an entry clearance application, the judge failed to consider  the
    following:

    i)      The cost of travelling to Jamaica.

      ii)   The cost of renting accommodation in Jamaica.

      iii)  They would have no means of income.

    iv)     It was uncertain how long the appellant would have to wait  for
    a visa.

    v)      The appellant has been resident in the United  Kingdom  for  17
    years.

    vi)     The appellant had no family members in Jamaica.

 8. The judge erred in stating that, during the period of their separation,
    the appellant and her husband would be able to  communicate  with  each
    other through modern means of communication. The judge failed  to  take
    into account a  decision  said  in  the  grounds  to  be  that  of  the
    Immigration Appeal Tribunal in "Nigeria [2011] UKUT 247 (IAT)" in which
    it is said that the Tribunal made the  point  that  ""modern  means  of
    communication  cannot  equate  to  ongoing   physical   and   emotional
    relationship available to people who  reside  together  or  nearby  one
    another."

 9. The judge failed to consider  the  public  interest  considerations  in
    s.117B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002  (the  "2002
    Act"),  i.e.  that  the  appellant  speaks  English  and  that  she  is
    financially independent.

10. Finally, it is said that the judge failed  to  take  into  account  the
    decision of the Upper Tribunal in Hayat (nature of Chikwamba principle)
    [2011] UKUT 00444 (IAC). The head-note of this case reads:

      "The significance of Chikwamba v SSHD [2008] UKHL 40  is  to  make  it
        plain that, in appeals  where  the  only  matter  weighing  on  the
        respondent's side of an Article 8 proportionality  balance  is  the
        public policy of requiring an application  to  be  made  under  the
        immigration rules  from  abroad,  that  legitimate  objective  will
        usually be outweighed by factors resting on the appellant's side of
        the balance. The Chikwamba principle is not confined to cases where
        children are involved or where the person with whom  the  appellant
        is seeking to remain has settled status in the United Kingdom."

Submissions

11. Ms Reid accepted that the judge had considered s.117B at para 26 of the
    decision, i.e. that the appellant speaks English and that  her  husband
    is  self-sufficient.  However,  she  submitted  that  the  only  proper
    consideration by the judge of the impact of temporary separation on the
    fact that the appellant cares for her father-in-law  was  at  para  25.
    However, whilst the judge found that, if the appellant and her  husband
    were to relocate permanently to Jamaica, her father-in-law could obtain
    care from social services, the judge failed to consider the position if
    the appellant were to return to Jamaica temporarily in order  to  apply
    for entry clearance. This was  important  given  that  the  appellant's
    father-in-law  receives  a  significant  level   of   care.   Temporary
    separation can amount to a disproportionate breach.

12. I asked Ms Reid whether any evidence was placed  before  the  judge  to
    show that temporary separation would have such consequences in relation
    to the care that the appellant's father-in-law receives from  her  that
    removal would be disproportionate even if permanent separation did not.
    Ms  Reid  informed  me  that  she  could  not  point  to  any  specific
    documentary evidence.

13. Ms Reid submitted that it  would  be  disproportionate  to  expect  the
    appellant to return to Jamaica to apply for entry clearance, given  the
    factors listed in the grounds of appeal.

14. Mr Staunton replied briefly. In  relation  to  s.117B(2)  and  (3),  he
    relied upon the Court of Appeal's judgment in Rhuppiah  v  SSHD  [2016]
    EWCA Civ 803.

Assessment

15. Dealing first with the judge's treatment of s.117B(2) and s.117B(3)  of
    the 2002 Act, the judge was not referred to Rhuppiah. Nevertheless,  it
    is clear from para 26 of his decision that he (correctly) regarded  the
    fact that the appellant speaks English as a neutral factor. He  appears
    to have  treated  the  fact  that  the  appellant's  husband  is  self-
    sufficient  as  equivalent   to   the   appellant   being   financially
    independent. Leaving aside whether this was  the  correct  approach  in
    view of  Rhuppiah,  the  fact  is  that,  even  if  the  appellant  was
    financially  independent  for  the  purpose  of  s.117B(3),  the  judge
    correctly treated it as a  neutral  factor.  To  the  extent  that  the
    grounds take issue with the  judge's  consideration  of  s.117B(2)  and
    s.117B(3), they amount to no more  than  an  attempt  to  re-argue  the
    evidence.

16. The main point raised on the appellant's behalf concerns the impact  of
    temporary separation, both on the appellant  in  view  of  the  factors
    listed in the grounds and described at my para 7 above and  the  impact
    on her father-in-law.

17. In relation to the impact on the appellant's father-in-law, it is clear
    that the judge considered, in terms, the impact of permanent relocation
    to Jamaica by the appellant and her husband.  He  considered  that  the
    care that the appellant's father-in-law required was available  to  him
    but that he did not want such assistance because he did not like paying
    for it. Although the judge did not specifically make a finding that  it
    would not be disproportionate  for  the  appellant's  father-in-law  to
    receive care from social services if the appellant were  to  return  to
    Jamaica temporarily to make an application  for  entry  clearance,  the
    fact is that he did consider the possibility  of  temporary  return  to
    Jamaica and he did quote from the headnote in Chen, in particular, para
    (i) of the headnote which specifically refers  to  this  issue.  In  my
    judgment, it is a reasonable inference to be  drawn  from  the  judge's
    assessment that, in reaching his decision that  removal  would  not  be
    disproportionate, he had in mind not only the impact of  the  appellant
    being separated temporarily from her husband but also her father-in-law
    when he considered  the  possibility  of  the  appellant  returning  to
    Jamaica to make an entry clearance application.

18. In any event, even if I am wrong about this,  Ms  Reid  confirmed  that
    there was no evidence before the judge  to  show  that  the  impact  of
    temporary separation on  the  appellant's  father-in-law  might  be  in
    breach of Article 8 even if permanent relocation by  the  appellant  to
    Jamaica did not. In the absence of such evidence, it is inevitable that
    the judge's decision would have been the same.

19. The grounds refer to "Nigeria [2011] UKUT 247 (IAT)". I assume this  is
    a reference to the decision of the Upper Tribunal (not the  Immigration
    Appeal Tribunal) in Omotunde  (best  interests  -  Zambrano  applied  -
    Razgar) Nigeria [2011] UKUT 00247 (IAC).  However,  Omotunde  concerned
    family life  between  a  parent  and  a  child.  The  children  of  the
    appellant's husband are adults. There are no minor children  who  would
    be  affected  by  the  appellant  returning   either   temporarily   or
    permanently to Jamaica.

20. In relation to the factors relied upon in the grounds and listed at  my
    para 6 above, the judge considered the appellant's  evidence  that  she
    would have no accommodation in Jamaica  and  that  she  had  no  family
    members in Jamaica. He was plainly aware that the appellant  had  lived
    in the United Kingdom for  17  years.  It  is  not  clear  whether  the
    remaining factors were in fact relied upon before the judge or  whether
    there was any evidence before the  judge  to  establish  them.  In  any
    event, it was not necessary for the judge to  have  dealt  specifically
    with each of the remaining factors. The suggestion that  the  appellant
    would have no means of income ignores the fact that her husband is self-
    employed and the evidence was that she was currently being supported by
    him. There was no evidence before the judge that her husband  would  be
    unable to give her financial support, to include the cost of travel and
    accommodation in Jamaica, if she returned temporarily.

21. Overall, I have to say  that  there  is  simply  no  substance  in  the
    grounds.

22. Given that there are no minor  children  involved  in  this  case,  the
    judge's finding that the appellant's father-in-law had  the  option  of
    obtaining care from social services and that the only reason he did not
    wish to do so was because he did not want  to  pay  for  it  and  given
    further the public interest considerations in s.117B having  regard  to
    the appellant's immigration history and that, as the judge  noted,  the
    appellant and her husband entered into the marriage in  full  knowledge
    of her immigration status, it was entirely open to the  judge  to  find
    that it would not be disproportionate for the appellant  to  return  to
    Jamaica either permanently with her husband or temporarily in order  to
    make an entry clearance application.

      Decision

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the  making  of
    an error on a point  of  law.  The  appellant's  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal is therefore dismissed.
