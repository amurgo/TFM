                                DETERMINATION



Introduction
On 23 July I sat with Upper Tribunal Judge Macleman and heard the  Secretary
of State's appeal against the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  who  had
allowed the appeal of LC.  We found that there were errors  of  law  in  the
determination of the First-tier  Tribunal  and  these  we  set  out  in  our
decision dated 19 August 2013.  On 3 September 2013 the  Principal  Resident
Judge at Field House made a transfer order so that I could hear  the  appeal
alone.  As the decision setting out the  error  of  law  in  the  First-tier
Tribunal's determination was lengthy and sets out the evidence I propose  in
this determination to incorporate the decision made on error of law in  this
determination using the same paragraph numbering.

The relevant facts and chronology were set out  in  the  decision  dated  19
August in paragraphs 2 through 7,  the  correspondence  leading  up  to  the
making of the deportation order in paragraphs 4 through 12 and in that  last
paragraph I set out the sentencing remarks of the Judge.

Having set out the reasons for finding that there was a  material  error  of
law in the determination we gave a direction that the OASys Report and  pre-
sentence report, if available, should be produced for the  further  hearing.


Error of law Decision
1.   The Secretary of State appealed, with permission, granted  on  21  June
    2013  against  a  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  who   in   a
    determination promulgated on 4 June  2013  allowed  the  appeal  of  LC
    against a decision of the Secretary of  State  to  make  a  deportation
    order under Section 32 of  the  UK  Borders  Act  2007.   Although  the
    Secretary of State is the appellant in the appeal before  us  we  will,
    for ease of reference, refer to her as the respondent as  she  was  the
    respondent before the First-tier Tribunal.  Similarly, although  LC  is
    the respondent in the appeal before us we will  refer  to  him  as  the
    appellant as he was the appellant before the First-tier Tribunal.

2.   The appellant is a citizen of China who was born on  18  January  1986.
    He entered Britain on 26 February 2002 claiming asylum and stating that
    he was a minor.  He was assessed by Social Services as being  over  the
    age of 18.  His application was refused.  His appeal was dismissed in a
    determination promulgated on 2 August 2002.

3.   The appellant overstayed.

4.   In January 2007 submissions were made on his behalf  under  the  legacy
    programme.  On 9 November that year the appellant's son, HC,  was  born
    to his partner, LL, in Britain.  LL had come to Britain as a student in
    November 2001.

5.    The  respondent  was  provided  with  evidence  of   the   appellant's
    relationship with LL and in July 2008 the appellant and HC were granted
    indefinite leave to remain.  On 21 November 2008 HC was granted British
    citizenship.

6.   In June 2010 the appellant, having pled guilty, was  convicted  of  two
    counts of robbery and sentenced to five years'  imprisonment.   He  was
    served with notice of his liability  to  deportation  in  October  that
    year.  In February 2011 LL gave birth to their second child, YC.

7.   In October 2011 LL was granted indefinite leave to remain.

8.   On 4 October 2010 the appellant  was  informed  of   his  liability  to
    automatic deportation and on 19 June 2012 the respondent wrote  to  the
    appellant asking him  if he considered there were any  reasons  why  he
    fell within one  of  the  exceptions  to  automatic  deportation  under
    Section 32(5) of the UK Borders Act  2007.   On  6  November  2012  the
    Secretary of State served a notice on the appellant that Section  32(5)
    of the UK Borders Act 2007 applied.  In reaching  that  conclusion  the
    Secretary of  State  took  into  account  the  appellant's  immigration
    history and the birth of his children, noting that the reasons given by
    the appellant that he met an exception under Section 32(5) were that he
    had a partner and two children in Britain. The  letter  considered  the
    rights of the appellant under Article 8 of the ECHR, referring  firstly
    to paragraph 398 of the Immigration Rules and  placing  weight  on  the
    fact that  that the appellant had been  sentenced  to  more  than  four
    years' imprisonment.

9.   The position  of  the  appellant's  son,  HC,  was  considered  by  the
    Secretary of State who stated that "it  is  accepted  that  it  may  be
    unreasonable  to  expect  your  child  to  leave  the  United   Kingdom
    potentially  giving  up   the   benefits   that   accompanied   British
    citizenship".  The notice however went on to state:-

         "While it is accepted that it may be unreasonable  to  expect  your
         son to leave the United Kingdom due to his British citizenship,  it
         is considered that this is an option open to you and  your  family.
         It is noted that your son is 4 years of age and  he  is  considered
         young enough to be able to readjust  to  life  in  China  with  the
         support of his parents.  Furthermore,  as  a  British  citizen,  it
         would be open to your son to return to the United Kingdom  when  he
         is old enough to live independently of you should he wish to do so.
          You have provided no evidence to suggest that your son may not  or
         cannot live in China and no evidence has been  adduced  to  suggest
         that it would be either impossible or exceptionally  difficult  for
         him to relocate to China.  It is also noted that your son's  mother
         is of Chinese origin and therefore it is assumed that your son  may
         have extended family who continue to reside in China who  would  be
         able to assist your son to readjust were he to relocate  to  China.
         These factors lead to the conclusion that your son  could  relocate
         to China and this remains an option that is available  to  you  and
         your family.  Nevertheless, it is accepted that due to  your  son's
         British citizenship, it may be considered  unreasonable  to  expect
         him to leave the United Kingdom."

10.  The notice went on to point out that while the appellant was in  prison
    his children had been living with LL who was caring for  them  and  who
    had indefinite leave to remain.  It was pointed out that she could live
    in Britain with the children should she wish.  It was  emphasised  that
    no evidence had been provided to suggest that LL  would  be  unable  to
    continue to care for the appellant's children in his absence if he were
    to be removed from the United Kingdom.  It was noted that she had  been
    the appellant's son's sole carer since he was remanded in custody on  8
    June 2010.

11.  It was noted that YC was a British  citizen  who  was  born  after  the
    appellant was imprisoned for committing a criminal offence and  it  was
    stated that there was no evidence to support his claim that he received
    visits and telephone calls from her although it was  accepted  that  he
    had a genuine subsisting relationship  with  her.   It  was  considered
    further that it might be unreasonable to expect her  to  leave  Britain
    potentially giving up the benefits that accompanied British citizenship
    and relocate to China but it was considered that  that  was  an  option
    available to her.

12.  The reason for the decision to deport was  the  appellant's  conviction
    on two counts of robbery.  It is appropriate to set out the  sentencing
    remarks of Judge J May QC in full:

         "You have pleaded guilty to two counts of robbery, arising  out  of
         one incident.  Your victims were two flat mates  sharing  a  ground
         floor flat.  In the middle of  the  night  while  they  slept,  you
         entered their flat and, one after another, you tied  them  up  with
         their own clothes and using cellotape.  You took their  bank  cards
         and you then terrorised them into giving  you  their  pin  numbers.
         Whilst you were with the second victim, the  first  wriggled  loose
         and called the police.


         You went back to her and re-tied her, saying that if she had called
         the police, you would kill her; but the police arrived  whilst  you
         were still there, and found you, hiding in  the  toilet,  with  the
         bank cards.  This was, clearly, a  terrifying  experience  for  the
         girls concerned.  I regard the tying up and restraining of them  as
         violent, albeit that  no  physical  injury  was  caused  to  either
         victim.


         I adjourned this from the last occasion, because I was told at that
         time that your DNA profile had been matched to  a  prior  incident,
         involving a very similar robbery  in  2005,  in  Cambridge,  and  I
         adjourned this for details of that.  I have been told that that was
         not proceeded with, as the complainants in that case had gone  back
         to China by the time your DNA was matched.   I  have,  today,  been
         told of another similar robbery in Lewisham, in  2005;  again,  the
         complainants appear to have returned to China.  So,  other  than  a
         DNA match, I have no information that the way in which the offences
         in Cambridge and Lewisham were carried out, was  the  same.   Other
         than that, I have no information.


         There appears to have been no physical injury caused to any of  the
         complainants in Cambridge or in Lewisham,  and  I  don't  have  any
         information as to any psychological impact.  I am not prepared - on
         the basis of  that  information  alone  -  to  make  a  finding  of
         dangerousness in your case.


         It remains something of a concern that  the  reason  you  gave  for
         carrying out these robberies, a �200,000 loan; it's  a  worry  that
         that loan remained outstanding.   I  am,  today,  told  that  there
         exists an agreement by which your father-in-law is going to pay off
         that sum.  As I said, I am not going to find you dangerous on  this
         occasion.


         Having said that, these offences are very serious, and there is  no
         question but that they pass the  custody  threshold.   The  regular
         guidelines, expressly, don't apply  to  violent  robberies  in  the
         home, which, as I have already said, I find this one to have been.


         Taking into account your guilty plea at the  earliest  opportunity,
         the sentence will  be  5  years  for  each  offence;  both  to  run
         concurrently.  The total is, therefore, 5 years.   You  will  serve
         half of that time, and I  direct  that  the  52  days  that  you've
         currently spent on remand be taken into account.  If  the  52  days
         turns out  to  be  inaccurate,  then  an  adjustment  can  be  made
         administratively, you don't need to come back to Court.
         At the end of that time, you will  be  released,  but  on  license.
         That means if you commit any further offences, or if the  Secretary
         of State sees any reason to do so, you can be returned  to  custody
         to serve out the rest of your sentence.


         That's all, you can go."


13.  The Tribunal heard evidence from the  appellant  and  LL.   They  first
    dealt with an  application  made  by  the  Presenting  Officer  for  an
    adjournment relating to the DNA evidence which indicated the  appellant
    had committed previous offences and further because  of  the  delay  in
    serving the appellant's bundle.  That application was refused.

14.  The appellant gave evidence which included his assertion  that  he  did
    not accept that he had broken into the property - the  door  he  stated
    was not closed properly and was not locked.   He had been chased  by  a
    creditor  and  was  nervous  and  drunk.   He   had   not   broken   in
    intentionally.  He claimed that he was not looking for someone to steal
    money from but he wanted to take something in order  to  help  pay  his
    debts.  The two girls had been in different bedrooms  and  he  had  not
    searched any other rooms before the bedrooms.

15.  The appellant had said that he had borrowed �200,000 and he  wanted  to
    make money for his baby.  He had set  up  a  business  which  had  been
    unsuccessful.  His father-in-law had  however  paid  off  his  debt  by
    selling a property in China.  He owed his father-in-law �200,000.

16.  The Tribunal then heard evidence from LL who stated that when  she  had
    come to Britain she had intended to return to China.   Her  father  had
    run a school for beauticians and she and her  parents  were  relatively
    well-off by Chinese standards.  However her father's  business  was  no
    longer doing very well.  She said that she  had  obtained  her  Masters
    Degree in Accounting and Finance, studying while  she  lived  with  the
    appellant.  She had returned to China in 2008 leaving her son with  the
    appellant.  She had been supported by her father at that time.

17.  She said that she  had  started  claiming  benefits  in  December  2012
    because her father's situation was no longer very  good.   She  claimed
    that she would not work in Britain because her children were too young.

18.  In paragraph 56 onwards of  the  determination  the  Tribunal  set  out
    their conclusions.  They referred to the guidance given  by  the  Upper
    Tribunal in Bah (EO (Turkey) - liability to deport) [2012]  UKUT  00196
    (IAC) and in Masih (deportation - public interest -  basic  principles)
    Pakistan [2012] UKUT 00046 (IAC).

19.  They then referred to the Immigration Rules relating to the  rights  of
    an appellant under Article 8 of the ECHR before stating,  in  paragraph
    63 that they did not accept that the appellant  had  given  a  truthful
    account of the circumstances of  the  burglary.   They  found  it  more
    likely than not that he had targeted two young women, specifically  for
    theft, and waited until he had found them at home alone.  They also did
    not accept the appellant's evidence of the reasons  for  borrowing  the
    money to import toys from China and sell  them  here  but  nevertheless
    they accepted he had borrowed over �100,000  to  start  "some  form  of
    business" and that he had been unable to repay the loan out of his  own
    resources.  They stated therefore that they had  treated  his  evidence
    with caution.

20.  They accepted however the evidence of LL.

21.  They  went  on  to  consider  the  comments  by  the  sentencing  judge
    regarding DNA evidence which  linked  the  appellant  to  two  previous
    crimes.  As they had not that evidence before them they stated they did
    not accept the  Presenting  Officer's  submission  that  the  appellant
    should be treated as a repeat offender.

22.  They then considered the issue of whether or not the appellant  was  at
    risk  of  re-offending.   They  noted  a  statement  from  LL's  father
    regarding his  repayment  of  the  appellant's  debts  which  had  been
    questioned by Mr Bryant because of the change in signatures.

23.  They went on in paragraph 70 to state:-

         "We bear in mind the fact that the appellant has been placed  in  a
         low risk Category D prison (A47), which is a  clear  indication  of
         the view the authorities have taken with regard  to  his  level  of
         risk.  We also note the email from a prison officer  (A32)  stating
         that he has not received any negative entries in his record."


24.  They stated that  they  accepted  the  evidence  that  the  appellant's
    father-in-law had paid off the  loan  and  stated  that  they  did  not
    consider that there was a  risk  the  appellant  would  commit  further
    offences to repay LL's father.

25.  In paragraph 72 onwards they dealt with what they considered to be  the
    central issue - that relating to the appellant's  two  young  children.
    They noted that the respondent had  accepted  that  they  were  British
    citizens and it was unreasonable to expect them to leave Britain.  They
    stated in paragraph 73 that there was no evidence regarding the risk in
    the province to which the appellant, LL and the children  would  return
    regarding penalties for having a second  child  and  stated  that  such
    penalties "might extend to imprisonment for one of the parents".

26.  They stated that the respondent had accepted that the appellant  had  a
    strong relationship with his partner and their children.  Having quoted
    from the determination of the Tribunal  in  Izuazu  (Article  8  -  new
    rules) Nigeria [2013] UKUT 45 (IAC) they focused on the  issue  of  the
    best interests of the children.  They stated in paragraph 77:-

         "The ability of the appellant's partner to care for their  children
         does not take any account of the effect on the children  of  losing
         their father for a lengthy period probably in excess of ten  years.
         We find the respondent has failed to consider  the  impact  on  the
         children of being separated from their family for the  majority  of
         their childhood means that her decision was not in accordance  with
         the law."


27.  They went on to state:-

         "78. We accept that LL has the right to remain in the UK  and  that
             she is likely to do so the children [sic].  Given their  young
             ages, we find the extended absence of their father  is  likely
             to have a significant and detrimental impact on the welfare of
             the children and their development.  Although they may be able
             to visit their father in China, we do not consider  that  this
             will be sufficient to  ameliorate  the  ill-effects  on  their
             relationships, particularly since we accept that  funding  for
             such visits is likely to be  extremely  difficult  for  LL  to
             arrange.


         79.   We  have  to  balance  the  children's  welfare  against  the
             respondent's important  public  duties  of  preventing  crime,
             protecting the public and expressing  society's  revulsion  at
             the appellant's very serious offending.  We  acknowledge  that
             the appellant's circumstances are very different from those of
             Mrs Izuazu and we accept that, without any family ties in  the
             UK, the appellant would find it extremely difficult to  resist
             expulsion.


         80.   However,  the  welfare  of  the   children   is   a   primary
             consideration.  It is clearly in their best  interests  to  be
             brought up by both parents in the UK, where the  parents  have
             indefinite leave to remain.  We accept that H was born in 2008
             and has therefore lived in the UK for  only  five  years.   We
             accept the evidence of the appellant and of LL that  they  did
             not separate at any time,  apart  from  short  visits  to  her
             parents and that the solicitors made an error in stating  that
             she had left the UK.  We find that H has not  resided  in  any
             other country.


         81.  For the reasons given above, we consider that the risk of  the
             appellant re-offending is low.  This means  that  less  weight
             should  be  attached  to  the  respondent's  important  public
             duties.


         82.  Looking at the evidence in the round, we find that the welfare
             of the children and the importance of  growing  up  with  both
             parents outweighs the respondent's important public duties  of
             preventing crime and protecting the public in  the  particular
             circumstances  of  this  case.   We  find  that  removing  the
             appellant and  splitting  up  the  family  will  amount  to  a
             disproportionate interference with their right to respect  for
             their family life under Article 8.  We allow the appeal."

28.  The Secretary of State appealed, referring to  the  appellant's  crime.
    It was pointed out that the Tribunal had said that the appellant  could
    not satisfy the Article 8 provisions in the  Rules  unless  there  were
    exceptional circumstances but that the Tribunal had made no finding  on
    that approach and had simply gone on to consider the best interests  of
    the children.  In the alternative it was  argued  that  the  Tribunal's
    proportionality assessment was incomplete "because  it  does  not  take
    account anywhere of the propensity  to  deportation  expressed  in  the
    Immigration Rules".  The grounds asserted that the legislation had  not
    been properly considered and that the "Article  8  provisions"  of  the
    Immigration Rules reflected the Secretary of State's view as  to  where
    the balance lay between an individual's rights and public interest.

29.  The final ground of appeal submitted that the assessment  of  the  best
    interests of the children was incomplete.  The Tribunal had found  that
    it was in the best interests of the children to be brought up  by  both
    parents and had gone on to state it was in their best interests  to  be
    brought up in Britain.  It was argued however that it was not clear why
    that should be so as the appellant's  partner  could  return  to  China
    where her family had considerable resources.  It was submitted that the
    conclusions on proportionality were incomplete.

30.  Permission to appeal was given by  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Saffer.  The appellant's solicitors then served a reply under  Rule  24
    stating that there was no requirement for the Tribunal to have had  any
    regard to the Immigration Rules, that in any event paragraph 397 of the
    Rules suggested the Human Rights Convention was considered prior to the
    question of "exceptional circumstances" and that it was trite law  that
    the appellant could  succeed  under  Article  8  even  if  he  had  not
    satisfied the Rules.  It was not a material error to fail to  determine
    whether  or  not  there  were  exceptional  circumstances.   The  reply
    emphasised that there was no requirement to show  exceptionality  under
    Article 8 and reference was made to the determination in Izuazu.

31.  With regard to the second ground of appeal it  was  stated  that  there
    was no such thing as a  propensity  to  deportation  as  opposed  to  a
    propensity to re-offend and it was argued that there was  no  authority
    for the proposition that length of sentence was determinative  for  the
    purposes of proportionality.

32.  It was argued that the Tribunal  had  given  clear  reasons  for  their
    decision to find that it was in the best interests of the  children  to
    be brought up by both parents in the United Kingdom and that  it  would
    be disproportionate to deport the appellant. With regard to the reasons
    for deportation letter the  respondent  had  relied  on  the  issue  of
    insurmountable obstacles and that that was wrong.  It was claimed  that
    the Secretary of State's contention that the  appellant's  partner  and
    his family had considerable resources was unfounded in fact.

33.  At the hearing of the  appeal  before  us  Mr  Wilding  relied  on  the
    grounds of appeal, concentrating  however  on  the  third  ground.   He
    argued that the assessment of the best interests of  the  children  was
    incomplete as there was no consideration of the  circumstances  of  the
    family in China.   All  that  had  been  considered  was  the  domestic
    circumstances here.  It was surely in their best  interests  to  go  to
    China with the whole family.

34.  In  any  event  he  argued  that  the  proportionality  assessment  was
    incomplete - the best interests of the children was not a determinative
    factor.

35.  He referred to the comments made in the  letter  of  refusal  regarding
    whether or not it was reasonable to expect the children to go to  China
    but stated that that was a nuanced position -  the  family  could  live
    together in China - there was nothing to stop them doing so.

36.  He  went  on  to  refer  to  the  legislative  provisions  relating  to
    deportation since the 2007 Act and  therefore  he  argued  the  greater
    weight to be  placed  on  the  public  interest  in  deporting  foreign
    criminals.  He referred to the judgment of the Court of  Appeal  in  SS
    (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ 550  where,  with  regard  to  the  issue  of
    exceptionality Laws LJ had stated at paragraph 46:-

         "Thus while the authorities demonstrate that there is  no  rule  of
         exceptionality; they also  clearly  show  that  the  more  pressing
         public interest in removal or deportation, the stronger must be the
         claim under Article 8 if it is to prevail.  This antithesis, in  my
         judgment, catches  in  the  present  context  the  essence  of  the
         proportionality test required by Article 8(2)."


37.  Mr Wilding  then referred to the comments of Laws LJ in  paragraphs  48
    onwards in which he had stated under the heading of "The deportation of
    foreign criminals (1) the source of the  policy:  primary  legislation"
    the following:-

         "48. With these considerations in mind I may turn to the particular
             case of the deportation of foreign criminals  under  the  2007
             Act.  Where such potential deportees have raised claims  under
             Article 8, seeking to resist deportation  by  relying  on  the
             interests of a child or children having British citizenship  I
             think with respect that insufficient attention has  been  paid
             to the weight to be attached, in  virtue  of  its  origin  and
             primary  legislation,  to  the  policy  of  deporting  foreign
             criminals.  In Sanade the UT observed 'the  more  serious  the
             offending the stronger is the case for deportation' [paragraph
             48].  With respect that is no  doubt  right;  but  it  applies
             readily to a  case  where  the  offender  is  not  subject  to
             automatic deportation under s.32  of  the  2007  Act  and  his
             removal  is  at  the  Secretary  of  State's  discretion.   In
             Strasbourg,  within  the  Uner/Maslov  criteria  we   find   a
             comparable reference to 'the nature  and  seriousness  of  the
             offence committed by the applicant'."


38.  He asked us to note that in that judgment in paragraphs 53 and 54  Laws
    LJ had stated:-
         "53. The importance of the moral and  political  character  of  the
             policy shows that the  two  drivers  of  the  decision-maker's
             margin of discretion - the policy's nature and  its  source  -
             operate in tandem. An  Act  of  Parliament  is  anyway  to  be
             specially respected; but all the  more  so  when  it  declares
             policy of this kind. In this case, the policy is  general  and
             overarching. It is circumscribed only by five carefully  drawn
             exceptions, of which the first  is  violation  of  a  person's
             Convention/Refugee  Convention  rights.  (The  others  concern
             minors,  EU  cases,  extradition  cases  and  cases  involving
             persons subject to orders under  mental  health  legislation.)
             Clearly, Parliament in the 2007 Act has  attached  very  great
             weight to the policy as a well justified  imperative  for  the
             protection of the public and to reflect  the  public's  proper
             condemnation of serious wrongdoers. Sedley LJ was with respect
             right to state that 'in the case of a 'foreign  criminal'  the
             Act places in the proportionality scales  a  markedly  greater
             weight than in other cases'.
          1. I would draw particular attention to the  provision  contained
             in s.33(7): 'Section 32(4) applies despite the application  of
             Exception  1...',  that  is  to  say,  a  foreign   criminal's
             deportation   remains   conducive   to   the    public    good
             notwithstanding his successful reliance on Article 8.  I  said
             at paragraph 46 that while the  authorities  demonstrate  that
             there is no rule of exceptionality for Article  8,  they  also
             clearly show that the more pressing  the  public  interest  in
             removal or deportation, the stronger must be the  claim  under
             Article 8 if it is to prevail.  The  pressing  nature  of  the
             public interest here is vividly informed by the fact  that  by
             Parliament's  express  declaration  the  public  interest   is
             injured if the criminal's deportation is not effected. Such  a
             result could in my judgment only be justified by a very strong
             claim indeed.
         (3)  Summary
         55.  None of this, I apprehend, is  inconsistent  with  established
             principle, and the approach I have outlined is well  supported
             by the authorities concerning the decision-maker's  margin  of
             discretion. The leading Supreme  Court  cases,  ZH  and  H(H),
             demonstrate that the  interests  of  a  child  affected  by  a
             removal decision are a matter of substantial  importance,  and
             that the court must proceed on a proper understanding  of  the
             facts which illuminate those interests (though upon the latter
             point I would not with respect accept  that  the  decision  in
             Tinizaray should be regarded as establishing anything  in  the
             nature of general principle). At the same time H(H) shows  the
             impact  of  a  powerful  public   interest   (in   that   case
             extradition) on what needs to be demonstrated for an Article 8
             claim to prevail over it. Proportionality, the absence  of  an
             'exceptionality'  rule,  and  the  meaning   of   'a   primary
             consideration' are all, when  properly  understood,  consonant
             with the force to be attached in cases of the present kind  to
             the two drivers of the decision-maker's margin of  discretion:
             the policy's source and the policy's nature, and in particular
             to the great weight which  the  2007  Act  attributes  to  the
             deportation of foreign criminals."
39.  He therefore argued that the Tribunal were in error in not weighing  up
    all  factors  in  the  appellant's  case  and  not  acknowledging   the
    legislative provisions within the  Rules.   He  pointed  out  that  the
    Tribunal had found that the appellant was not credible and that he  had
    sought to downplay his actions.
40.   He  argued  therefore  there  were  material  errors  of  law  in  the
    determination of the Tribunal and  asked  that  we  set  that  decision
    aside.
41.  In reply Mr Slatter pointed out  that  SS  was  not  mentioned  by  the
    respondent in the grounds of appeal and there had been no reply to  the
    Section 24 response which he had prepared and on which he relied.
42.  He referred to the fact that the  Tribunal  had  mentioned  the  public
    interest in paragraph 79 and had considered that the appellant would be
    unlikely to offend.  They had taken into account that there was no need
    for the appellant to commit further  offences  and  they  had  properly
    weighed in the balance the fact the  children  were  British  and  that
    their mother had indefinite leave to remain in her own right.   In  any
    event the appellant had himself been granted indefinite leave to remain
    before the conviction.
43.  He argued that in effect the grounds of appeal and submissions made  by
    Mr  Wilding  were  merely  a  disagreement  with  the   proportionality
    assessment of the Tribunal and did not point  to  any  misdirection  in
    law.  He stated that in any event the judgment in SS (Nigeria) was case
    specific, referring to paragraphs 34 and 35 of that judgment.   Indeed,
    that judgment noted that the best interests  of  the  children  were  a
    primary  consideration.   Those  considerations  had  been  taken  into
    account by the Tribunal who had found that it  was  not  reasonable  to
    expect the appellant's partner and children to return  to  China  -  in
    that they had followed what had been said in the letter of refusal.
44.  At the end of the hearing we stated that we had found that  there  were
    material errors of law in the determination of the Tribunal.
45.  Mr Slatter had argued that the judgment in SS was dated after the  date
    of decision and had not  been  mentioned  in  the  grounds  of  appeal.
    However, we consider that that judgment  merely  clarifies  and  to  an
    extent amplifies the correct approach to the law as set out in a number
    of judgments of the Court of Appeal starting with  that  in  N  (Kenya)
    [2004] EWCA Civ 1094 and including DS (India)  [2009] EWCA Civ  544 and
    AD LEE [2011] EWCA  Civ 348 as well as, of  course,  determinations  of
    the Tribunal such as that in Masih to which the panel referred.
46.  We consider that the reality is that the Tribunal did not carry out  in
    sufficient detail the necessary balancing exercise when  assessing  the
    proportionality of removal.  While the interests of the children  is  a
    primary concern, a number of factors need to be taken into account when
    assessing what is actually in the best interests of a child.  It is not
    necessarily the case that living in Britain is in the best interests of
    a child and indeed, as is stated in E-A (Article 8 - best interests  of
    the child) (Nigeria) [2011]  UKUT  315 (IAC)  for young children it  is
    appropriate that they should follow their parents  when  their  parents
    are returned to another country.  In this case the appellant  would  be
    returning to China.  While LL has indicated that she would not wish  to
    return to China it would be for her to decide whether or  not  to  keep
    the family together.  The facts relating to the circumstances which the
    children would face in China will also need to  be  considered.   While
    the Tribunal concluded in paragraph 37 that it  was  reasonably  likely
    that the family would be penalised by  the  authorities  in  China  for
    having a second child they give no reasons for  their  conclusion  that
    there was a reasonable likelihood that the penalty was  such  that  one
    member of the family might face would be imprisonment.
47.  We note, of course, that while the issue of the best interests  of  the
    child is a primary factor to take into account when  assessing  whether
    or not removal is  disproportionate,  it  is  only  a  factor  and  not
    determinative.  Equally important,  we  consider,  particularly  having
    regard to the public interest is the removal of a foreign criminal  who
    has been convicted of a serious offence. In  that  regard  we  consider
    that the Tribunal erred in law in not properly setting out and  placing
    weight on the very serious nature of the appellant's crime - he entered
    a house where two young women were sleeping, tied them  up,  threatened
    them and took their credit cards.  The trauma  which  they  would  have
    experienced was a relevant factor in the  judge's  conclusion  that  an
    appropriate sentence was one of five years.  That reflects the  serious
    nature of the crime.  Moreover the Tribunal  did  not  place  into  the
    balance the fact that the appellant, before them, had showed no remorse
    for what he had done and attempted to play down the seriousness of  his
    crime.  What the Tribunal stated in paragraph 63 is relevant - they did
    not  accept  the  appellant  had  given  a  truthful  account  of   the
    circumstances of the burglary and they found that more likely than  not
    that he targeted two young women specifically for theft and waited till
    he had found them at home alone. We do not consider what  the  Tribunal
    wrote in paragraph 79 shows that they placed sufficient weight  on  the
    appellant's criminality.
48.   The  Tribunal  clearly  had  very  considerable   doubts   about   the
    credibility of the appellant.
49.  They reached a conclusion  that  the  appellant  would  not  re-offend.
    Their conclusion was based on the fact  that  the  appellant  had  been
    placed in a low risk category D prison and  did  not  have  a  negative
    record  in  prison.    However,  that  did  not  demonstrate  that  the
    appellant's crime was not serious or that he would not re-offend,  only
    that it was not thought that he would attempt  to  escape  and  behaved
    while in prison.  Although the respondent's grounds did  not  focus  on
    paragraph 70  of the panel's   determination,  we  find  a  significant
    error also in the illogical  conclusion reached there.  With regard  to
    the level of risk which the  appellant  would  pose  on  release,  more
    relevant is the statement in the Border Agency letter  of  21  November
    2012 that the appellant should be detained because his release  carried
    a high risk of public  harm  and  there  was  a  risk  of  further  re-
    offending.  They referred to the appellant's dishonesty in the evidence
    he gave regarding his identity on arrival and  the  fact  that  he  had
    overstayed.  They assessed the appellant as posing a  serious  risk  of
    harm to the public because he had committed two counts of  robbery  and
    that there was a significant risk that he would re-offend.
50.  For the above reasons we find lacunae in the Tribunal's  assessment  of
    the proportionality of removal in relation to (a) the best interests of
    the children (b) and the lack of weight they placed on the  appellant's
    serious criminality and (c) the risk of re-offending.  We consider that
    those errors amount to material errors of law.
51.  We therefore indicated at the hearing  that  we  would  set  aside  the
    decision and would propose to hear submissions prior to  re-making  the
    decision.  We indicated that we considered that the Tribunal  had  been
    hindered by the fact that they did not have before them a  pre-sentence
    report or an OASys Report.  Neither party had these  reports  to  hand.
    It was clear that neither party  had  been  ordered  to  produce  these
    reports at the pre-hearing review.
52.  Having taken instructions Mr  Slatter  stated  that  he  believed  that
    these reports existed and that they could be produced.  He  asked  that
    rather than proceed immediately to re-hear the appeal we adjourn  to  a
    further date so that these documents could be produced and  considered.
    We agreed that that would be an appropriate course of action.
53.  While it was Mr Slatter on behalf of the appellant who stated that  the
    reports were in existence and that those instructing him would be  able
    to produce the reports we considered that it was equally incumbent upon
    the respondent to obtain and lodge copies of the reports.
54.  We therefore set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  on  the
    basis that there is a material error of law therein and  directed  that
    the appeal be set down for re-hearing on  6  September  2013  at  Field
    House.  We adjourned the hearing so that reports which were said to  be
    in existence could be obtained.
Submissions on 6 September
 55. At the hearing of the appeal on 6 September  Mr  Slatter  first  stated
    that he did not have sight of the letter from the Home Office dated  21
    November  2012  to  which  I  had  referred  in  paragraph  49  of   my
    determination.  He and Mr Bramble were then furnished with copies.  The
    appellant's representatives  had  produced  the  OASys  Report  and  Mr
    Slatter indicated that he did not wish to call any further evidence but
    rather to rely on the evidence given by the appellant  and  LL  at  the
    hearing before the Tribunal.

56.  A pr�cis of the evidence of LL is set out in paragraph 16 above.

57.  Mr Bramble in his submissions first  referred  to  the  issue  of  what
    penalties, if any, would be faced by  the  appellant  and  LL  if  they
    returned to China with the children.  He pointed out that LL had stated
    that  she  came  from  Liao  Ning  Province  and  he  referred  to  the
    determination of the Tribunal  in  the  country  guidance  case  of  AX
    (Family Planning Scheme) China CG [2012] UKUT 00097 (IAC).  He referred
    to the headnote which reads as follows:-

         "Single-child families

         (5)  Parents who restrict themselves to one  child  qualify  for  a
             'Certificate  of  Honour  for  Single  Child   Parents'   (SCP
             certificate), which entitles  them  to  a  range  of  enhanced
             benefits throughout their lives, from priority schooling, free
             medical treatment, longer maternity, paternity  and  honeymoon
             leave, priority access to housing and to retirement homes, and
             enhanced pension provision.






         Multiple-child families


         (6)  Any second child, even if authorised, entails the loss of  the
             family's SCP certificate.  Loss of a family's SCP  results  in
             loss of privileged access to schools,  housing,  pensions  and
             free  medical  and  contraceptive  treatment.   Education  and
             medical treatment remain available but are no longer free.
         (7)  Where an unauthorised child is born, the family will encounter
             additional penalties.  Workplace  discipline  for  parents  in
             employment is likely to  include  demotion  or  even  loss  of
             employment.  In addition,  a  'social  upbringing  charge'  is
             payable (SUC), which is based on income, with a  down  payment
             of 50% and three years to pay the balance.


         ...


         (9)  The financial consequences for a family of losing its SCP (for
             having more than one child) and/or of having SUC imposed  (for
             having unauthorised children) and/or  suffering  disadvantages
             in terms of access to education, medical  treatment,  loss  of
             employment, detriment to future employment etc. will  not,  in
             general, reach the severity threshold to amount to persecution
             or serious harm or treatment in breach of Article 3."

58.  Mr Bramble went on  to  state  that  the  issue  of  return  to  Fujian
    Province had been set out in  the  letter  of  6  November  2012  which
    referred to the Canadian IRB report which states  that  information  on
    penalties faced by couples returning to China from overseas who were in
    violation of family planning regulations was scarce but stated  special
    provisions for returned overseas  Chinese  with  a  second  child  were
    relevant in the province of Fujian.  The  writer  of  the  decision  to
    deport had stated:

         "In  light  of  the  information  available  it  is  accepted  that
         returning to China with your Chinese partner and two children could
         potentially result in some form of penalty being applied if you are
         deemed to have breached the one child policy, however it  is  clear
         this  policy  is  applied  inconsistently   across   the   country.
         Furthermore objective evidence available suggests that the birth of
         an unauthorised child abroad is unlikely to result in a penalty and
         would be largely dependent on the province.  As  it  is  considered
         likely that your family would return to  Fujian  Province  if  they
         choose to accompany you to China, consideration was  given  to  the
         Regulations and place in  the  Fujian  Province.   The  information
         available is considered to suggest that you would  be  unlikely  to
         encounter difficulties if you returned  to  Fujian  Province  as  a
         family unit despite having had more  than  one  child  due  to  the
         children's citizenship and the fact that they were born outside  of
         China.   It  is  not  accepted  that  relocation  would  be  either
         impossible or exceptionally  difficult  but  nevertheless  accepted
         that it may be unreasonable to expect your daughter to relocate  to
         China on account of her British citizenship."


59.  He stated that in fact the First-tier Tribunal had made no  finding  on
    this point in their decision where they had said there was no  evidence
    regarding the risk in the province from which LL came.  He stated  that
    their conclusion that the family would be penalised by the  authorities
    for having a second child "and that  such  penalties  might  extend  to
    imprisonment for one of the parents" was clearly wrong - there  was  no
    evidence to support that assertion.

60.  Mr Bramble went on to say that  the  simple  issue  in  this  case  was
    whether or not the public interest was outweighed by the  circumstances
    which the appellant and his family were to face on return.  He referred
    to the judgment of the Court of Appeal in SS from which I had quoted in
    paragraphs 36 through 38 above.  He emphasised the seriousness  of  the
    offence and referred to the sentencing remarks.  He asked  me  to  note
    that the Tribunal had not accepted the truthfulness of the  appellant's
    account and then referred me to the OASys Report which he claimed  made
    it clear that the appellant was still a risk to the public.

61.  He then referred to the position of  the  children  pointing  out  that
    their young ages meant that they would be unlikely to have set up links
    outside the family unit here but stated that the decision would be  for
    the family to  decide  whether  or  not  LL  and  the  children  should
    accompany the appellant to China.

62.  He referred to the evidence that some support was still received by  LL
    from her father and emphasised that it was she who had looked after the
    children as their primary carer while the appellant was in prison.

63.  There was no reason why the appellant should not obtain work  in  China
    to support the family and LL could also work there.

64.  He again emphasised the serious nature of  the  appellant's  crime  and
    the relevant legal context in  which  his  removal  and  the  automatic
    deportation provision should be made.

65.  In reply Mr Slatter argued first the respondent's decision was  not  in
    accordance with the law and that that was a  finding  of  the  Tribunal
    which the Tribunal had been correct to make.  Therefore he stated  that
    he would argue that the Tribunal had found that the  third  requirement
    in the structured approach in Razgar had not been met and that on  that
    basis alone the appeal should have been allowed.  He then  argued  that
    the Tribunal had erred in not considering the rights of the   appellant
    under the Rules in that they had not considered whether  or  not  there
    were exceptional factors in this case. He did  not  elaborate  on  what
    those might be.

66.  Moreover he stated that it was not open to the respondent to argue,  or
    for the Tribunal to find that the children could be expected to  follow
    with their mother the appellant to China.  He referred to paragraphs 92
    and 97 of Sanade and Others (British  children  -  Zambrano  -  Dereci)
    [2012] UKUT 00048 (IAC) where the  President  of  the  Immigration  and
    Asylum Chamber, quoting from Counsel who had appeared on behalf of  the
    respondent,   had  stated  that  it  was  accepted  on  behalf  of  the
    respondent that :

         "In a case where third country nationals  are  unable  to  claim  a
         right to reside on the basis set out above it will not logically be
         possible, when  assessing  the  compatibility  of  the  removal  or
         deportation with the ECHR  to  argue  that  any  interference  with
         Article 8 rights could be avoided by the family unit  moving  to  a
         country which is outside the EU".


     He stated that that concession had been repeated in  the  determination
    MF (Article 8 - new rules) Nigeria [2012] UKUT 393 (IAC)  at  paragraph
    72 where the Presenting Officer was noted as having  conceded  that  it
    would not be reasonable to expect a British citizen mother to  relocate
    with her child who was also a British citizen to the country  to  which
    the father was being removed.

67.  He stated that LL had indefinite leave to remain in her own  right  and
    that the appellant was  an  integral  part  of  the  family  unit.   He
    emphasised the needs of the children and  stated  that  they  would  be
    denied the general enjoyment of their rights as British citizens should
    the  appellant  be  removed.   This  was  an  important  part  of   any
    proportionality exercise.

68.  With regard to the issue of risk he asked me to find that LL  had  been
    found to be a generally credible witness and that the Tribunal appeared
    to accept that her father had paid off the  debt  due.   Therefore  the
    risk of re-offending was surely low.  He asked me to take into  account
    the fact that the appellant had now been on bail for over one month and
    had not  committed any  offences  and  indeed  had  not  committed  any
    offences since he was sentenced,  albeit that he  had  been  in  prison
    until his recent release on bail.

69.  He emphasised that the OASys Report indicated that  the  appellant  was
    at low risk of offending and that that was a significant  factor  under
    European law as was indicated in a decision of the Tribunal in  Sanade.



70.  He therefore asked me to allow the appeal.

Determination.
71.  This is an appeal against automatic deportation. The  appeal  can  only
    succeed if it is found that the deportation of the appellant would lead
    to a disproportionate infringement of his rights under Article 8 of the
    European Convention on Human Rights.

72.   The First-tier Tribunal found that the  appellant  could  not  benefit
    from the provisions of the Rules.  They were correct  to  so  find.   I
    would  add  that  there  is  nothing  in  the   way   of   "exceptional
    circumstances" as set out in paragraph 398(c)  which  would  mean  that
    this appellant might come within the provisions  of  the  rules.   Each
    case is, of course, different from other cases, but  there  is  nothing
    which makes the appellant's case exceptional. Of course, the  appellant
    has British children, but    that I do not consider that that is a fact
    which makes this case exceptional.  The appellant is  not,  of  course,
    the child's primary carer.  I therefore turn to consider the rights  of
    the appellant under the European Convention on Human Rights.

73.  In considering the appellant's rights under Article 8  of  the  ECHR  I
    note the test set out by Lord Bingham of Cornhill in R (Razgar) v  SSHD
    [2004] UKHL 27 in the well-known five stage test:
         "(1) Will the proposed removal  be  an  interference  by  a  public
             authority with  the  exercise  of  the  applicant's  right  to
             respect for his private or (as the case may be) family life?
         (2)  If so,  will  such  interference  have  consequences  of  such
             gravity as potentially to engage the operation of Article 8?
         (3)  If so, is such interference in accordance with the law?
         (4)  If so, is such interference necessary in a democratic  society
             in the interests of national security, public  safety  or  the
             economic well-being of the  country,  for  the  prevention  of
             disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals,  or
             for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others?
         (5)  If so, is such interference proportionate  to  the  legitimate
             public end sought to be achieved?"
74.  I accept that there is a family life existing  between  the  appellant,
    LL  and  the  children.   The  deportation  of  the  appellant  is   an
    interference with that right such as to engage his rights under Article
    8 of the ECHR.  It would be for a legitimate purpose - the removal of a
    foreign criminal and I consider that it is also in accordance with  the
    law.

75.  I would at this stage note that Mr Slatter wished  to  argue  that  the
    decision was not in accordance with the law and indeed  that  this  had
    been a finding  of  the  Tribunal  below.   I  do  not  understand  the
    conclusion in that regard in paragraph 77  of the determination of  the
    First-tier Tribunal  where it is stated that the  respondent's  failure
    to consider the impact on the children of being  separated  from  their
    father for the majority of their childhood meant that the  decision was
    not in accordance with the law.  That simply is incorrect.   The  issue
    of the children was dealt with in the decision dated  6  November  2012
    where there is a lengthy section relating to family life.  In  pages  5
    through 12 the Secretary of State  deals  first  with  the  duty  under
    Section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 and  to
    the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of children and refers to
    the judgment of the Supreme Court in ZH (Tanzania) before going  on  to
    consider the position of the children and the impact of Chinese  family
    policies.  The decision was clearly in accordance with the  law  as  it
    was made under relevant legislation.

76.  I therefore have concluded for the above reasons that the  decision  is
    in  accordance  with  the  law.   The  issue  comes  down  to  that  of
    proportionality and in particular  the  issue  of  the  rights  of  the
    children.

 77. I would emphasise that the welfare of the children  is  a  primary  but
    not a paramount  consideration. I note the ages of the children  -  the
    appellant's daughter is 2 and his son 5.  They do not  appear  to  have
    formed any links outside the home.  They clearly have the right  to  be
    brought up in Britain and to be educated here.   There  is  nothing  to
    indicate,  however,  that  they  could  not  be  brought   up   equally
    comfortably in China.  It appears  that  LL  comes  from  a  relatively
    prosperous family - her father  had  two  properties  and  a  business,
    although it was her evidence that the business is  not  doing  so  well
    now.  She herself has qualifications obtained here which she could  use
    to find work in China.  There was no reason why the appellant could not
    find work in China.  While it  does  appear  that  there  may  be  some
    penalties because the appellant and LL have had  more  than  one  child
    there is nothing in the country guidance case of AX  to  indicate  that
    these  would  be  anything  other  than  either  the  loss  of  certain
    privileges or possibly a financial fine - and given the ability of LL's
    father to, it is claimed, pay off the appellant's debts here  there  is
    clearly some money available on return.   I  therefore  consider  that,
    should the family decide that they should remain together  and  LL  and
    the children return with the appellant they would be able to do so  and
    would not suffer hardship such as to mean that the return  of  all  the
    family as a family unit would not be a viable option let alone that the
    clear presumption in automatic deportation,  that  a  foreign  criminal
    should be removed, would be overturned.

78.  But, of course, the reality is that LL and the children are  not  being
    removed and there is no pressure on them to  go  to  China  with  their
    father.  It was not considered reasonable that they should be  expected
    to go with him. Whether the family all return to China  together  is  a
    decision which should  be  made  by  the  appellant  and  LL  who  must
    themselves consider the best interests of the children.  The  Secretary
    of State is doing nothing to infringe  the  Article  8  rights  of  the
    children or indeed their rights  under  European  Law.   Their  primary
    carer and, indeed, over the last two years their only carer,  has  been
    their mother who is not being removed.  Indeed even if they go to China
    they would always, as British citizens, be able  to  return  here  when
    they wished either for further education or to work.

79.  If the appellant is removed and they remain and  are  deprived  of  the
    presence of a father here that is the consequence  of  the  appellant's
    criminality.  As Sedley LJ stated in paragraph 27 of  his  judgment  in
    Lee:-

         "27. The tragic consequence of this family, short lived as  it  has
             been, will be broken up forever because of the appellant's bad
             behaviour".

80.  I have considered the OASys Report.  It sets  out  the  nature  of  the
    appellant's offence at section R11.12

         "LC's two year OGRS is 8%, OGP 7%, and OVP 10% indicating low  risk
         of general and violent re-offending.  However LC's offence is of  a
         serious nature whereby two  females  were  bound,  blindfolded  and
         gagged within their  own  home  whilst  they  were  sleeping.   The
         offence is likely to cause a significant degree  of  emotional  and
         physical harm to the victims that is likely  to  effect  them  long
         term.   LC  demonstrated  violence  in  the  manner  in  which   he
         imprisoned the victims  within  their  home  and  threatened  them,
         making threats to kill.  However LC  did  not  inflict  any  direct
         physical injuries to the victims during the  offence.   He  has  no
         previous convictions.  LC indicates that offence was opportunistic.
          However, given that LC's friend lived within  the  same  block  of
         flats  there  is  a  potential  of  preplanning  and  targeting  of
         vulnerable women which would be a concern".


81.  The report   sets  out   the  "predictor  scores  percentage  and  risk
    category."  That relating to the probability of proven re-offending was
    a low percentage of 4% in the first year increasing to 8% in the second
    year.  That of proven non-violent offending going up from 4% to 7%  and
    the probability of "violent type re-offending" going up from 6% to 10%.
     These were all in the low category.  However it does show  a  probable
    increase in the likelihood of re-offending.

82.  At section R10.1.of the report  the answer to the question of  who  was
    at risk was noted as being "public -  specifically  women/or  those  LC
    perceives as vulnerable" the nature of the risk was "robbery,  violence
    by way of tying up victims........ threats" and the circumstances which
    were likely to increase risk were described  as  "alcohol  consumption,
    continuous financial pressures, lack of employment/income, breakdown in
    family  relationships,  other  stressors".  I  note  that  the   "OASys
    assessment" states that  the  risks  in  the  community  were  low  for
    children, known adults and staff but medium for the public.

83.  I would summarise  the  OASys  Report  as  showing  that  although  the
    appellant's risk of re-offending is low it is by  no  means  negligible
    and that factors such as unemployment would increase risk. There  seems
    no indication that the appellant  would  be  able  to  obtain  work  in
    Britain and he has no employment record here and therefore  I  consider
    that unemployment is likely to be a factor in  the  future  and   could
    well trigger re-offending.  If the appellant re-offends  -and  again  I
    note that the risk is not assessed as high -  violence  might  well  be
    part of the re-offending.  I note the particularly traumatic experience
    which his victims in the index offence went through  and  that  despite
    the appellant's claim that he was drunk at the time that there  was  an
    element of premeditation.

84.  I therefore conclude  that  the  risk  of  the  appellant  re-offending
    cannot be discounted.

85.  The appellant received a sentence of five years:  that  is  a  sentence
    for a significant period of time.  I note the terms of the judgment  of
    the sentencing judge who stated that while he was not going to find the
    appellant "dangerous on this occasion" he went on to say that he  found
    that the offence was a violent robbery in  the  home  and  clearly,  as
    indicated in the level of the sentence, he considered that the  offence
    was serious.

86.  I have quoted the relevant passages from a  judgment  in  SS  (Nigeria)
    [2013] EWCA Civ 550 above and, in particular, I note what was stated by
    Laws LJ who stated the more pressing the public interest in removal  or
    deportation the stronger must be the claim under Article 8 if  it  were
    to prevail.  There is clearly  an  extremely  strong  interest  in  the
    removal of someone such as the appellant who has  committed  a  serious
    and violent crime.  I note, moreover, the comment  of  Rix  LJ  in   DS
    (India) [2009] EWCA Civ 544:

         "In my judgment, when consideration is given to the manifold nature
         of that public interest (see N (Kenya) at paragraph 87 E-O (Turkey)
         [2008] EWCA Civ 671...at paragraph 19 and OH (Serbia)  v  Secretary
         of State for the Home Department [2008] EWCA Civ 694  at  paragraph
         15) it cannot be said the AIT erred in this  respect.   The  public
         interest in deportation of those who  commit  serious  crimes  goes
         well beyond depriving the offender in question of the chance to re-
         offend in this country.  It extends  to  deterring  and  preventing
         serious crime generally and upholding  public  abhorrence  of  such
         offending".

87.  I therefore find, having considered the serious  nature  of  the  crime
    committed by this appellant, and also considering the best interests of
    the children as a primary, but  not  a  paramount  factor,  and  having
    placed appropriate weight on the legislation which reflects the will of
    Parliament and taking into account the possibility of the appellant re-
    offending, that the  removal  of  the  appellant  under  the  automatic
    deportation provisions is a proportionate decision.

88.    I therefore  conclude  that,  the  determination  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal having been set aside,  the  appellant's  appeal  against  the
    decision to deport should be dismissed on both  immigration  and  human
    rights grounds.

Decision.
This appeal is dismissed on both immigration and human rights grounds.
