                           BWAWANJOT SINGH SEMBHI
                                                                   Appellant
                                     And

                           ENTRY CLEARANCE OFFICER
                                                                  Respondent


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS



      1. The appellant was refused entry clearance for reasons set out in  a
         decision date 6th March 2014. His appeal against that decision  was
         heard and allowed by a First-tier Tribunal judge in a determination
         promulgated on 10th  December  2014.  The  respondent  was  granted
         permission to appeal


      2. On 10th  February  2015  the  appellant,  through  his  solicitors,
         informed the Tribunal that he wished to  withdraw  his  appeal.  In
         accordance with Rule 17 of The Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)
         Rules 2008 this is treated as an application for the consent of the
         Upper Tribunal to the withdrawal of his case.  The  Upper  Tribunal
         consents to the withdrawal by the appellant of his case.


      3. The consequences of this are that the decision  of  the  First-tier
         Tribunal judge is set aside and I remake the decision by dismissing
         it; the decision of the Entry Clearance Officer therefore stands.


    Conclusions:


    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside  and
    the appeal against the decision  of  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  is
    remade and dismissed.
