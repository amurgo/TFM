Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Khurram Solicitor with Hanif & Co Solicitors.

For the Respondent:    Mr Mills - Senior Home Office Presenting Officer.



                            DECISION AND REASONS


     1. The appellant, a citizen of Somalia born on 2 June 1984, claims  to
        have arrived in the United Kingdom  on  22  November  2002  shortly
        after  which  he  claimed  asylum.  The  respondent   refused   the
        application against which the  appellant  appealed.  The  appellant
        succeeded on appeal when it was accepted he was  a  member  of  the
        Ashraf minority clan and therefore at risk on return to Somalia. On
        17 March 2004 the appellant was recognised as a refugee and granted
        indefinite leave to remain.
     2. On 4 April 2014 the appellant  was  convicted  of  possession  with
        intent to supply controlled Class A drugs - heroin,  for  which  he
        was sentenced to 5� years imprisonment.
     3. On 11 February 2015 a decision was made to deport him in accordance
        with section 32(5) of the UK Borders Act 2007.
     4. On 26 January 2016 the appellant was notified of  the  respondent's
        intention to cease his refugee status pursuant to Article 1C(5)  of
        the Refugee Convention and paragraph 339A of the Immigration  Rules
        on the basis that the circumstances in connection with which he had
        been recognised as a refugee had ceased to  exist.  In  a  decision
        dated 12  October  2016  the  respondent  refused  the  appellant's
        protection and human rights claim and maintained  the  decision  to
        deport him. A deportation order was issued the same day.
     5. The appellant appealed. This appeal was heard before the First-Tier
        Tribunal on 17 February 2017 in  which  the  Judge,  amongst  other
        issues, made the following findings: (a) that the appellant posed a
        danger to the community and that the respondent had properly  found
        that he had failed  to  rebut  the  presumption  in  section  72(2)
        Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, (b)  that  there  had
        been a significant and non-temporary  change  in  circumstances  in
        Somalia so that the appellant was no longer at risk of  persecution
        for a Refugee Convention reason on his  return  to  Mogadishu,  (c)
        that the appellant would not have access to financial resources and
        would have no family or clan support and that he would end up in an
        IDP camp where there was a real possibility of having  to  live  in
        conditions that fell below  acceptable  humanitarian  standards  in
        breach of Article 3, (d)  with  regard  to  article  8,  the  Judge
        accepted the appellant a genuine and subsisting  relationship  with
        his wife and  children  and  that  the  effect  upon  them  of  his
        deportation would be unduly harsh. The Judge accepted the appellant
        was socially and culturally integrated into the United Kingdom  and
        that there would be very significant obstacles to  his  integration
        to Somalia. The Judge found  there  were  compelling  circumstances
        outweigh the public interest in the appellants deportation and that
        the appellant met the requirements of the immigration rules and  on
        article 8 grounds, leading to the appeal being allowed pursuant  to
        both article 3 and 8 ECHR.
     6. The Secretary of  State  sought  permission  to  appeal  which  was
        granted. At an Error of Law hearing on 4 July 2017  Upper  Tribunal
        Judge Kebede found the First-Tier Tribunal had erred in  law  in  a
        manner material to the decision to dismiss the  appeal.  The  Judge
        Kebede's reasoning is set out at [12 - 14] in the following terms:


         12.      I find myself in agreement with the assertion made in the
                    respondent's grounds, that the Judge  failed  adequately
                    to engage with all the paragraphs of the  head  note  to
                    the country guidance in MOJ.  Although the Judge clearly
                    had regard to the country guidance and set out the head-
                    note in full at [23], there is nothing in  her  findings
                    to show that she gave consideration to (x)  and  to  the
                    question  of  access  to   economic   opportunities   in
                    Mogadishu. At  [24]  she  referred  to  the  appellant's
                    limited qualifications and skills but did not  elaborate
                    or provide any reasons why  he  could  nevertheless  not
                    find employment. The Judge also, rather curiously, found
                    that  the  appellant  would  have  no  form  of  ongoing
                    support, but she did not provide any  details  nor  give
                    reasons as to why he could not access support  from  his
                    family in the UK or his brother in  Norway.  Accordingly
                    the Judge's conclusion, that the  appellant  would  find
                    himself destitute and subjected to harsh  conditions  in
                    an IDP camp that amounted to a breach of Article 3,  was
                    inadequately reasoned.


     13. For the same reasons the Judge erred, in her Article 8  assessment,
                    in her finding that  there  would  be  very  significant
                    obstacles to the  appellant's  integration  in  Somalia.
                    That, in turn, fed  into  her  findings  on  "compelling
                    circumstances".  Furthermore,  I  find  merit   in   the
                    respondent's submission that the Judge's decision failed
                    to identify  any  proper  reasons  why  the  appellant's
                    circumstances were considered to be compelling  or  what
                    was  exceptional  about  the  best  interests   of   the
                    appellant's children in  the  terms  considered  in  The
                    Secretary of State the Home Department  v  CT  (Vietnam)
                    [2016] EWCA Civ 488.


                    14.  For  all  these  reasons  I  consider  the  Judge's
                    conclusions on Article 3 risk on return, and on  Article
                    8, to be unsustainable and accordingly her decision must
                    be set aside. The  decision  on  Articles  3  and  8  is
                    therefore set aside.


     7. At [15] of the Error of Law decision the Upper  Tribunal  confirmed
        the scope of the next hearing which  is  for  the  decision  to  be
        remade on Articles 3 and 8 ECHR  grounds  only,  with  the  Judge's
        findings on exclusion and cessation being preserved.



Background


     8. The matter was listed for a Resumed Hearing before another judge of
        the Upper Tribunal at Birmingham on 13 July 2018.  The  appellant's
        previous representatives had written to the Upper Tribunal on  12th
        July indicating that the  barrister  instructed  to  represent  the
        appellant  had  on  that  day   withdrawn   due   to   professional
        embarrassment and  seeking  an  adjournment  to  allow  alternative
        counsel to be instructed in the matter. The Upper Tribunal  granted
        the appellant's request. The matter was relisted for hearing on  26
        September 2018 with notices being sent to the parties by post on 23
        August 2018.
     9. On 21 September 2018 another firm of solicitors, Hanif & Co,  wrote
        to the Upper Tribunal confirming they had been  instructed  by  the
        appellant and providing a form  of  authority  dated  21  September
        2018.
    10. The Upper Tribunal then received a request for the  hearing  listed
        on 26 September to be adjourned as the new representatives required
        time to compile and serve any relevant documents and bundles.  That
        application was refused  by  a  Duty  Lawyer  exercising  delegated
        powers on the basis the decision on error of law  was  sent  on  12
        July 2018 and notice of hearing on 23 August  2018  and  that  late
        instruction of new representatives by the appellant did not justify
        the hearing being vacated at this late stage.  Time  and  resources
        had already been allocated for the case to be heard  and  it  would
        not be possible to  list  an  alternative  matter  at  this  stage.
        Further, the respondent did not appear to have been given notice of
        the application. The appellant  was  given  liberty  to  renew  the
        request at the hearing.
    11.  At  the  hearing  on  the  26  September  2018   the   appellant's
        representative was present but not, initially,  the  appellant.  Mr
        Khurram advised that the delay in instructing solicitors was  as  a
        result  of  financial  problems  and  that  Hanif  &  Co  had  been
        instructed once the appellant was in funds. He stated he needed  to
        see the appellant who, it appeared, had gone to the  Priory  Courts
        in Birmingham where the First-Tier Tribunal sit, despite the notice
        of hearing clearly stating the Upper Tribunal will  be  sitting  in
        the  Employment  Tribunal  Building.  When  the  appellant  finally
        arrived at the Upper Tribunal he was able to  hear  his  advocate's
        submissions.
    12. It is accepted that at the last hearing the appellant was in  funds
        which Mr Khurram stated was because a friend had paid his  previous
        representatives, Khan Solicitors.
    13. When asked the scope of their instructions it was confirmed Hanif &
        Co had accepted instructions to represent  the  appellant  for  all
        proceedings and not only for the renewed  adjournment  application.
        Mr Khurram was asked why his client could not update  his  case  in
        examination in chief,  from  the  developments  since  the  earlier
        statements which he confirmed he could. It was stated however  that
        Social Services had become involved with  the  family  since  March
        2018 and that it was believed there  is  a  risk  assessment  being
        undertaken  by  Social  Services  with  a  view  to  the  appellant
        returning to live with his children; as the appellant was not  with
        the family at that time.
    14. Mr Mills, on  behalf  of  the  Secretary  of  State  confirmed  the
        respondent was ready to proceed in July but that the appellant  had
        not attended that hearing and that the matter has been put off as a
        result of the fairness principle. There  had  been  delay  in  this
        matter being relisted and being brought back and early evidence has
        been provided. It was submitted the  current  representatives  have
        been instructed late  and  that  the  appellant  was  "playing  the
        system".  Mr  Mills  opposed  the  adjournment  on  the  basis  the
        principles of fairness did not require the same to be granted.
    15. Mr Khurram stated in March 2018 the  appellant  had  been  released
        from detention and that his circumstances had now changed and  that
        he will be ready to proceed if given time. It was claimed that  one
        month will be sufficient.
    16. There has been considerable delay in this  matter  including  as  a
        result of the appellant failing to attend the hearing before  Upper
        Tribunal Judge Kebede. Lack of funds is not a reason to an  adjourn
        as it is not  made  out  the  appellant  could  not  have  provided
        evidence to update his circumstances or to have  prepared  for  the
        hearing as a self-representing  litigant  if  required.  Sufficient
        time to prepare had already been given and it was not made out that
        the appellant or any witnesses could not provide oral  evidence  to
        confirm  their  current  situation.  It  was  not  established  the
        principle  of  fairness  required  a  further  adjournment  of  the
        proceedings; although it was considered if an  issue  arose  during
        the  course  of  the  hearing  that  required  the   same   further
        consideration would be given to it.
    17. The appellant was thereafter called to give oral evidence in  which
        he confirmed, inter alia, the statement he provided on 26 September
        2018 was true. He was released from immigration detention in  March
        2018 and has  contact  with  his  family  and  with  his  wife  and
        children. The appellant claims to take the children to  school  and
        to spend time with them. The appellant is not working as he is  not
        permitted to work and claimed that if deported he could not rely on
        funds from abroad and that the family could not go to Somalia.  The
        appellant was cross-examined.  There  was  no  re-examination.  The
        appellant's wife also gave oral evidence confirming  her  statement
        was accurate and  in  response  to  questions  from  the  advocates
        confirmed the appellant was released sometime  in  March  2018  and
        that although they had lived together  briefly  since  release  the
        appellant was not permitted by Social Services to live with her  or
        the children at that time. The appellant's wife considered  she  is
        in a subsisting relationship with her husband and that contact  and
        indirect contact occurs.
    18. In cross examination the appellants wife was asked how the children
        had coped as they had not lived with the appellant for a number  of
        years to which she claimed it was quite hard for them.  When  asked
        to explain the impact of the appellant's removal the witness stated
        he had been around since being released from prison  and  that  the
        children get emotional when they speak to him  and  upset  if  they
        cannot see their father. The witness confirmed that  they  see  the
        appellant whenever they have money  or  social  services  range  of
        contact which is supervised by social services at  their  house  or
        another place. A social worker  has  been  appointed.  The  witness
        confirmed there have been meetings with social workers and that the
        appellant can come to the house but must  return  and  cannot  stay
        overnight. This was agreed approximately 2 months ago. The evidence
        indicates ongoing assessment by social services,  but  the  witness
        stated that work had been completed resulting  in  more  supervised
        contact taking place after which there will be a further review. No
        decision has yet been made on the future arrangements at this time.
        The witness confirmed the  children  had  been  on  the  "at  risk"
        register but came off last year and that the children  are  in  her
        full-time care.
    19. The  witness  confirmed  the  extended  family  in  Birmingham  the
        appellant has and that she does not speak to her  family.  She  has
        lived in Rotherham all her life. It was said in Birmingham there is
        the appellants sister and nephews with whom there is contact.
    20. In reply to questions from the bench the witness  confirmed  social
        service had become involved with her first child a long time ago, a
        child not related to the appellant, who  now  lives  with  her  own
        parents, which is a long-term arrangement. The three boys mentioned
        in her statement are  the  appellant's  children  and  that  social
        services have been involved since the birth of the  children.  When
        asked the reason for their involvement the witness confirmed it was
        as a result of concerns  regarding  physical  abuse  and  emotional
        neglect which was initially attributed to the witness herself,  but
        then as her parents did not  like  the  appellant  social  services
        became involved with both the witness and appellant.
    21. A childcare conference occurred approximately  a  week  before  the
        hearing. The children were on the child  protection  register  when
        the appellant went into prison. Although concerns have been  raised
        there was no suggestion of the commencement of care or  supervision
        proceedings arising from the childcare meetings and  that  although
        social services were more involved at the point the appellant  went
        into prison their involvement was reduced a year or two thereafter.
        The witness stated she had got on with life and that  although  she
        did not like social services  intervening  she  has  "put  up  with
        them".
    22. As stated, social services have not  expressed  concerns  that  the
        children are at risk of physical harm or neglect in  her  care  and
        that the Guardian appointed to represent the children supported the
        view that  the  children  should  remain  with  their  mother,  the
        witness, and that  they  should  work  around  this  scenario.  The
        witness stated social services were assessing  the  impact  on  the
        children if the appellant is returned to the family.
    23. There was no re-examination or questions arising.
    24. A third witness, the appellant's niece, confirmed  the  content  of
        her statement, that there was no family in Mogadishu, and that  she
        could not financially support the appellant.


Discussion



    25. The effect of the section 72 certificate is that the  appellant  is
        excluded from the protection of the Refugee Convention. Such status
        previously granted to the appellant was revoked by the Secretary of
        State. No arguable legal error is made out in these aspects of  the
        respondent's decision. Indeed,  if  the  appellant  were  to  claim
        asylum now on the basis of his membership of  the  Ashraf  clan  in
        Somalia, absent any new matters arising that may give rise to grant
        of international protection, any claim for asylum or  international
        protection will be more likely than not to be refused on the  basis
        of the current country conditions and relevant country guidance set
        out in MOJ& Ors (Return to Mogadishu) Somalia CG [2014] UKUT  00442
        (IAC), and availability of a  viable  internal  flight  alternative
        which would preclude the appellant from a  grant  of  international
        protection. MC (Art 1 (c) (5) Mogadishu) Somalia [2018]  UKUT  2018
        considered in making such finding.
    26. In any event,  the  rejection  of  protection  claim  is  preserved
        findings are not a matter before this Tribunal.
    27. It is, however, relevant to consider the current  country  guidance
        case relating to  Somalia.   In  MOJ&  Ors  (Return  to  Mogadishu)
        Somalia CG [2014] UKUT 00442 (IAC) it was held that(i) The  country
        guidance issues addressed in this determination are  not  identical
        to those engaged with by the Tribunal in AMM and others  (conflict;
        humanitarian crisis; returnees; FGM) Somalia  CG  [2011]  UKUT  445
        (IAC). Therefore, where country guidance  has  been  given  by  the
        Tribunal in  AMM  in  respect  of  issues  not  addressed  in  this
        determination then the guidance provided by AMM shall  continue  to
        have effect; (ii) Generally, a person who is "an ordinary civilian"
        (i.e. not associated  with  the  security  forces;  any  aspect  of
        government or official administration or any NGO  or  international
        organisation) on returning to Mogadishu after a period  of  absence
        will face no real risk of persecution or risk of harm  such  as  to
        require protection under Article 3 of the ECHR or Article 15(c)  of
        the Qualification Directive. In particular, he will not be at  real
        risk simply on account of having lived in a European location for a
        period of time  of  being  viewed  with  suspicion  either  by  the
        authorities as a possible supporter of Al Shabaab or by Al  Shabaab
        as  an  apostate  or  someone  whose  Islamic  integrity  has  been
        compromised by living in a Western country; (iii)  There  has  been
        durable change in the sense that the  Al  Shabaab  withdrawal  from
        Mogadishu is complete and there  is  no  real  prospect  of  a  re-
        established presence within the city. That was not the case at  the
        time of the country guidance given by the  Tribunal  in  AMM;  (iv)
        The level of civilian casualties, excluding non-military casualties
        that  clearly  fall  within  Al  Shabaab  target  groups  such   as
        politicians,  police  officers,  government  officials  and   those
        associated with NGOs and  international  organisations,  cannot  be
        precisely  established  by  the  statistical  evidence   which   is
        incomplete and  unreliable.  However,  it  is  established  by  the
        evidence considered as a whole that there has been a  reduction  in
        the level of civilian casualties since 2011,  largely  due  to  the
        cessation  of  confrontational  warfare  within  the  city  and  Al
        Shabaab's resort to  asymmetrical  warfare  on  carefully  selected
        targets.  The present level of casualties  does  not  amount  to  a
        sufficient risk to ordinary  civilians  such  as  to  represent  an
        Article 15(c) risk; (v)  It is  open  to  an  ordinary  citizen  of
        Mogadishu to reduce further still his personal exposure to the risk
        of "collateral damage" in being caught up in an Al  Shabaab  attack
        that was not targeted at him by avoiding areas  and  establishments
        that are clearly identifiable as likely Al Shabaab targets, and  it
        is not unreasonable for him to do so; (vi) There is no real risk of
        forced  recruitment  to  Al  Shabaab  for  civilian   citizens   of
        Mogadishu, including for recent returnees from the West; (vii)    A
        person returning to Mogadishu after a period of absence  will  look
        to his nuclear family, if he  has  one  living  in  the  city,  for
        assistance in re-establishing himself and  securing  a  livelihood.
        Although a returnee may also seek assistance from his clan  members
        who are not close  relatives,  such  help  is  only  likely  to  be
        forthcoming for majority clan members, as minority clans  may  have
        little to offer; (viii)  The significance  of  clan  membership  in
        Mogadishu has  changed.  Clans  now  provide,  potentially,  social
        support  mechanisms  and  assist  with   access   to   livelihoods,
        performing less of a protection function than previously. There are
        no clan militias in Mogadishu, no clan violence, and no clan  based
        discriminatory treatment, even for minority clan members; (ix)   If
        it is accepted that a person facing a return to Mogadishu  after  a
        period of absence has no nuclear family or close relatives  in  the
        city to assist him in re-establishing himself on return, there will
        need to be a careful assessment of all of the circumstances.  These
        considerations  will  include,  but  are  not   limited   to:   (a)
        circumstances in Mogadishu before departure; (b) length of  absence
        from Mogadishu; (c) family or clan associations  to  call  upon  in
        Mogadishu; (d) access to financial  resources;  (e)   prospects  of
        securing  a  livelihood,  whether  that  be  employment   or   self
        employment; (f) availability of remittances from abroad; (g)  means
        of support during the time spent in the United Kingdom; (h) why his
        ability to fund the journey  to  the  West  no  longer  enables  an
        appellant to secure financial support on return; (x)   Put  another
        way, it will be for the person facing  return  to  explain  why  he
        would not be able to access the economic  opportunities  that  have
        been produced by the economic boom, especially as there is evidence
        to the effect that returnees are taking  jobs  at  the  expense  of
        those who have never been away; (xi)  It will, therefore,  only  be
        those with no clan or family support who will not be in receipt  of
        remittances from abroad and who have no real prospect  of  securing
        access to a livelihood on return who  will  face  the  prospect  of
        living in circumstances falling below that which is  acceptable  in
        humanitarian  protection  terms;  (xii)   The  evidence   indicates
        clearly that it is not simply those who  originate  from  Mogadishu
        that may now generally return to live in  the  city  without  being
        subjected to an Article  15(c)  risk  or  facing  a  real  risk  of
        destitution. On the other  hand,  relocation  in  Mogadishu  for  a
        person of a minority clan  with no former links  to  the  city,  no
        access to funds and no other form of clan, family or social support
        is unlikely to  be  realistic  as,  in  the  absence  of  means  to
        establish a home and some form of ongoing financial  support  there
        will be a real risk  of  having  no  alternative  but  to  live  in
        makeshift accommodation within an IDP camp where there  is  a  real
        possibility of having to live in conditions  that will  fall  below
        acceptable humanitarian standards.
    28. Mr Mills submissions referred to the provisions of the headnote set
        out at (viii) and (ix).
    29. The country guidance case law reaffirms the need  to  consider  all
        relevant circumstances of an individual before making  findings  in
        relation to their ability to satisfy the relevant criteria, or not.
        The criteria present a considerable hurdle  for  the  Secretary  of
        State, but the burden is not upon  him  to  initially  establish  a
        person can return but upon an appellant alleging an entitlement  to
        international protection or right to remain  that  they  should  be
        awarded the same. In this case that is the article 3 ECHR aspect.
    30.  The  appellant  is  a  healthy  individual  in  his  mid-30s  with
        considerable experience of working and living in Somalia. Mr  Mills
        argued the appellant has not discharged the burden upon him to  the
        required standard to establish that his circumstances are such that
        he would face destitution  or  be  unable  to  support  himself  if
        returned to Somalia. The appellant has no disability, there are  no
        psychiatric issues, and no established credible impediment  to  the
        appellant being able to work.
    31. The issue of remittances from family  members  was  raised  in  the
        error of law finding and it is not  made  out  that  the  appellant
        would not have access to resources from the family  members  either
        in the United Kingdom or  elsewhere.  The  bare  assertion  by  one
        witness that she would not  be  able  to  provide  support  appears
        contrary to both the family  and  cultural  values  of  the  Somali
        community  who  will  help  each  other  as   much   as   possible.
        Insufficient evidence was provided to establish  that  any  claimed
        refusal to assist is genuine or that the economic circumstances  of
        the  individuals  concerned  is   such   that   they   would   not,
        realistically, be able to provide some form of assistance.
    32. The appellant fails to make out that any  assistance  that  may  be
        available,  even  if  less  than  he  will  prefer,  would  not  be
        sufficient to enable him to secure  accommodation  and  meet  basic
        needs if returned to Somalia with other income  arguably  available
        to him through work.
    33. The appellant fails to  establish  that  he  would  be  subject  to
        unacceptable living standards if returned to Somalia sufficient  to
        amount to a breach of his rights pursuant to Article 3 ECHR.
    34. Mr Mills referred the tribunal to the  decision  of  the  Court  of
        Appeal in MA (Somalia) [2018] EWCA Civ 994 and specifically at  [63
        - 64] where it was found:


             63. The analysis in Said, by which this  Court  is  bound,  is
             that there is no violation of Article 3 by reason only of  the
             person being returned to a country which for economic  reasons
             cannot provide him  with  basic  living  standards.  Mr  Sills
             however contends  that  the  situation  is  brought  about  by
             conflict, which is recognised by the European Court  of  Human
             Rights as an exception to this analysis. It is true that there
             has historically been severe conflict in Somalia, but, on  the
             basis of MOJ, that would  not  necessarily  be  the  cause  of
             deprivation if the respondent were returned  to  Somalia  now.
             The evidence is that there is no present reason why a  person,
             with support from his family and/or prospects  of  employment,
             should face unacceptable living standards.


             64. Mr Waite submits that the decision of  this  Court  in  FY
             (Somalia) v Sec State for the Home Department  EWCA  Civ  1853
             could be read as departing from Said and is accepting that  it
             was sufficient for Article 3 purposes that a person  returning
             to his country of origin might end up living in  and  the  IDP
             camp. Although the holding of the FTT in that case  (paragraph
             22), which this Court held had not  erred  in  law  (paragraph
             23), could be read as so  holding,  Said  was  not  cited  and
             therefore in my judgement to the  extent  that  there  is  any
             conflict between the decision of this Court in Said  and  that
             in FY (Somalia), the decision of this Court in Said should  be
             followed.


    35. The appellant has not discharged the burden of proof upon him, even
        to the lower standard applicable in  appeals  of  this  nature,  to
        establish  credible  argument  that  he  does  not  have  realistic
        prospects of employment or that he would face  unacceptable  living
        standards or destitution on return to Somalia sufficient to  engage
        article 3 ECHR or an entitlement to  any  aspect  of  international
        protection remaining available to him, if any.
    36. In relation to article 8 ECHR, I find there  is  family  life  that
        exists between the appellant his  wife  and  their  children.  Such
        family life existed before the appellant  was  imprisoned  and  has
        continued since his release from criminal and immigration detention
        albeit that the frequency of contact and nature  of  the  way  such
        family life is enjoyed is affected by the  intervention  of  social
        services as a result of concerns they have for  the  well-being  of
        the children.
    37. The contact the appellant enjoys with the children is supervised at
        the insistence of social services who are carrying out a review  to
        ascertain whether it is safe for the appellant  to  return  to  the
        family environment. Social services involvement is as a  result  of
        concerns centred around physical and emotional neglect and/or harm,
        real  concerns  illustrated  by  the  convening  of   a   childcare
        conference, appointment of a guardian for the  children,  and  work
        being undertaken to ensure the children's needs are properly met.
    38. The tribunal  is  very  grateful  to  the  children's  mother,  the
        appellant's wife, for her assistance and the honest  way  in  which
        she answered questions relating to the children.
    39. The effect of the enforced separation is that the appellant and the
        children live approximately one hundred  miles  apart  making  more
        frequent contact  difficult  as  a  result  of  the  geography  and
        possible  economic  reality  of  the  cost  of  travelling  between
        Yorkshire where the children live and the  appellant's  address  in
        Birmingham.
    40. It is not disputed that the  best  interests  of  children  are  to
        remain in an  environment  with  both  parents,  provided  such  an
        environment is a loving, caring, and supportive one, to enable  the
        children to attain their maximum potential; but the best  interests
        are not  the  determinative  aspect,  albeit  one  of  considerable
        importance.
    41. The appellant is the subject of a deportation order as a result  of
        his conviction for serious drug-related offences for which  he  was
        imprisoned for 5 � years by the Nottingham Crown Court.
    42. This is not the first such offence as the appellant  was  convicted
        of possession of a controlled drug Class  B  drug  -  cannabis  and
        possession of a controlled Class A  drug  -  heroin  together  with
        other  matters  recorded  in  the  appeal  papers  prior  to   this
        conviction.
    43. To resist deportation the appellant is therefore required  to  show
        very compelling circumstances sufficient  to  outweigh  the  public
        interest in his removal from the United Kingdom. Both the Court  of
        Appeal in Supreme Court have reminded us that a  very  strong  case
        needs to be made out to resist such deportation which, on the facts
        of this matter, is not made out.
    44. It is accepted that  if  the  appellant  is  deported  he  will  be
        separated from the children and they from him physically, but  that
        is normal consequence of deportation. No adverse  impact  upon  the
        children or  indeed  the  appellant's  wife  has  been  established
        sufficient to outweigh the  public  interest  in  deportation.  The
        appellant's wife has, to her credit, had to bring the  children  up
        during the time the appellant has been in  prison  and  immigration
        detention and on a practical day-to-day  level  during  the  period
        since the appellant's release, when he  has  been  prohibited  from
        living within her family home. The fact the  appellant's  wife  and
        children may be upset as a result of the separation that may  occur
        is not sufficient to outweigh the very strong  public  interest  in
        the appellant's removal.
    45. There is no evidence any of a negative  impact  on  the  children's
        education or psychological health and the involvement and  presence
        of social services in the family  unit  indicates  ongoing  support
        will be available, if required. It is also to  the  credit  of  the
        children's mother that social services are happy for  the  children
        to remain with her as she is able  to  adequately  care  for  them,
        notwithstanding the difficulties she has faced. It is also the case
        that there was no evidence provided to show that when the appellant
        was in prison social services needed to  be  involved  any  further
        than they were and did not need to issue proceedings to protect the
        welfare of the children. There was no need  to  take  the  children
        into care or seek any statutory orders. As Mr Mills submitted  this
        was a trial run of how the family would cope if  the  appellant  is
        deported.
    46. Mr Khurram relied upon the skeleton argument that had been prepared
        prior to the hearing and  the  oral  evidence  and  submitted  that
        social services had indicated that they would allow  the  appellant
        to return to live in the family home. It was argued that there will
        be a deterioration in the children's welfare if  the  appellant  is
        deported and that  in  all  the  circumstances  the  appellant  had
        discharged the burden of proof to establish that his  removal  from
        the United Kingdom is disproportionate.
    47. Any case involving the loss to a child of a parent brings  its  own
        issues that require careful consideration. In this  case,  however,
        the appellant is the author of his own misfortune as  a  result  of
        his serious criminal  offending  resulting  in  an  order  for  his
        deportation from the United Kingdom. The children are fortunate  in
        that they have their mother and statutory  services  to  assist  if
        necessary. It is also  the  case  that  insufficient  evidence  was
        provided to substantiate the appellant's claim that if removed from
        the United Kingdom sufficiently compelling circumstances  had  been
        made out to outweigh the public interest in his removal. Members of
        the family may consider that the appellant's removal is harsh,  but
        it has not been established, when weighing the competing interests,
        that it will be unduly harsh. Any interference in  the  appellant's
        family and private  life  established  in  the  United  Kingdom  is
        proportionate to the legitimate aim relied upon.
    48. I find the Secretary of State has discharged the  burden  of  proof
        upon him to the required standard  to  show  that  the  appellant's
        deportation from the United Kingdom is a proportionate response  in
        light of his criminal conduct and when  considering  the  competing
        arguments, in light of existing provisions and case law.
