Representation:

For the Appellant:           Ms. E. Daykin, of Counsel, instructed by  Ennon
                       & Co. Solicitors.
For  the  Respondent:                Ms.  C.  Gough,  Senior   Home   Office
                 Presenting Officer.

      A decision to revoke or refuse  to  renew  a  grant  of  asylum  under
    paragraph 339A of the Immigration Rules only relates to the individual's
    status under the Qualification Directive (European refugee  status)  and
    not his status under the Refugee Convention; further, it can only  apply
    to cases in which the asylum application was made on or after 21 October
    2004 and at least one of the provisions in  sub-paragraphs  (i)-(vi)  of
    para 339A of the Immigration Rules applies.

      If an individual was granted refugee status some time  ago,  there  is
    no legal or evidential presumption that, for so long as he is a  refugee
    under the Refugee Convention, removal would be in breach of  Article  3.
    Whilst the past may  be  relevant  in  shedding  light  on  the  current
    situation and the prospective Article 3 risk, it remains the  case  that
    the question whether there is a real risk  of  Article  3  ill-treatment
    must be answered at the date of the hearing and is forward-looking.





                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.    The Appellant is a 35-year old national of Vietnam who  has  lived  in
    the United Kingdom since the age of twelve, having left Vietnam  at  the
    age of eight and lived in Hong Kong  with  his  family  for  about  four
    years. He arrived in the United Kingdom on 4 July 1989 with  his  father
    and older siblings (a brother and a  sister).  His  father  was  granted
    refugee status. It appears that the UK Border Agency no longer  has  any
    information about the reasons why the Appellant's father (who has  since
    died) was granted refugee status. Ms. Daykin informed us that her papers
    indicate that the asylum claim of the Appellant's father  was  processed
    and decided in Hong  Kong.  Although  the  Appellant  was  also  granted
    refugee status, it is clear that he did not have an  independent  asylum
    claim; he was dependent on his father's asylum claim. His  siblings  and
    his father were later naturalised as British citizens.  The  Appellant's
    application of 24 April 1996 for naturalisation as a British Citizen was
    refused on 24 June 1999 on the ground of his character.

2.    The Appellant has  been  granted  permission  to  appeal  against  the
    determination of the First-tier Tribunal (Designated Judge of the First-
    tier Tribunal J F W Phillips and Mr. M E Olszewski  JP)  (hereafter  the
    panel) dismissing his appeal against a deportation  order  made  against
    him on 6 October 2011 by virtue of section 32(5) of the U.K. Border Acts
    2007. The deportation order followed the Appellant's  conviction  on  30
    March 1999 at the Central Criminal Court of  murder  and  wounding  with
    intent to cause grievous bodily harm for which he received sentences  of
    life imprisonment and seven years' imprisonment respectively.

3.     Given  that  the  Appellant  had  been  sentenced  to  a  period   of
    imprisonment of at least two years, the panel  upheld  the  Respondent's
    decision to apply the presumption under section 72 of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 Act (the 2002 Act),  that  he  had  been
    convicted by final judgment of  a  particularly  serious  crime  and  to
    constitute a danger to the community of the United Kingdom.   The  panel
    further found that the Appellant had gone  nowhere  near  rebutting  the
    presumption that he is a danger to the community. It found that  he  had
    been convicted of a particularly serious crime and that he was a  danger
    to the community.  These  findings  have  not  been  challenged  on  the
    Appellant's behalf.   Accordingly,  the  Appellant  is  a  person  whose
    refoulement is not prohibited by Article 33 of the  Refugee  Convention.
    It follows that it has been established that his removal would not be in
    breach of the United Kingdom's obligations under the Refugee Convention.



4.    The Respondent  revoked  (or  purported  to  revoke)  the  Appellant's
    refugee status under para 339A(v) of the Statement  of  Changes  in  the
    Immigration Rules HC 395 (as amended)  (the  Immigration  Rules).   This
    mirrors the cessation  clause  in  Article  1C(5)  of  the  1951  Geneva
    Convention relating to the Status of Refugees (the Refugee  Convention),
    which provides that the Refugee Convention shall cease  to  apply  to  a
    person "if he can no longer, because of circumstances in connection with
    which he has been recognised as a refugee have ceased to exist, continue
    to refuse  to  avail  himself  of  the  protection  of  the  country  of
    nationality". The panel found that the Appellant  was  still  a  refugee
    because the Respondent could not show  that  the  cessation  clause  she
    sought to rely upon applied. This finding has not been challenged.

5.    The Respondent also revoked (or purported to revoke)  the  Appellant's
    refugee status under para 339A(x) of the Immigration Rules on the ground
    that, having been convicted  by  a  final  judgment  of  a  particularly
    serious crime, he constituted a danger to the community  of  the  United
    Kingdom. The equivalent of this provision in the Refugee  Convention  is
    to be found in Article 33, which prohibits refoulement but provides,  by
    virtue of Article 33, that the benefit of the non-refoulement  provision
    may not be claimed by  a  refugee  who,  having  convicted  by  a  final
    judgment of a particularly serious crime constitutes  a  danger  to  the
    community of the United Kingdom. However, whilst the Refugee  Convention
    does not give any hint that Contracting States may  revoke  the  refugee
    status of the individual concerned,  para  339A(x)  of  the  Immigration
    Rules, which was intended to implement Article 14 of  Council  Directive
    2004/83/EC (the Qualification Directive), provides for the  individual's
    "grant of asylum" to be revoked or  not  renewed.  An  issue  before  us
    (issue (a)) is whether there is an inconsistency in this respect between
    the two and, if so, which should prevail.

6.    Having found that the Appellant was a danger  to  the  community,  the
    panel  considered  that  the  Respondent  was  entitled  to  revoke  the
    Appellant's refugee status under para 339A(x) of the Immigration  Rules.
     Their reasons are set out at our paragraphs 14, 15 and 16 below.

7.    In the panel's view, the revocation of the Appellant's refugee  status
    meant that there was  no  longer  a  presumption  that  the  Appellant's
    removal to Vietnam would be in breach of his rights under Article  3  of
    the 1950 European Convention for the  Protection  of  Human  Rights  and
    Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR).  The second issue which has  arisen  (issue
    (b)) is whether there is a presumption, for so  long  as  a  person  has
    refugee status under the Refugee Convention, that his removal  from  the
    United Kingdom would be in breach of his rights under Article 3  of  the
    ECHR.

8.    Having concluded that the Appellant's refugee status had been  revoked
    under para 339A(x) with the result (in the panel's view) that there  was
    no presumption of risk in relation to Article 3,  the  panel  considered
    that it was therefore for the Appellant to show that his  removal  would
    be in breach of Article 3 (para 46).  The panel went on to consider  the
    evidence and found that the Appellant had not shown that he was at  real
    risk of treatment in breach of his rights under Article 3. We  summarise
    their reasons for  their  conclusion  at  our  paragraph  17  below.  No
    challenge has been made to the panel's finding (if  it  was  correct  to
    place the burden the proof in relation to Article 3  on  the  Appellant)
    that he had not discharged that burden.

9.    The panel concluded that the Appellant had not shown that  he  was  at
    real risk of serious harm in Vietnam. In any event, he was excluded from
    humanitarian protection pursuant to para 339D of the Immigration  Rules,
    having been convicted of a serious crime (para 48 of the determination).



10.   The panel also found that the Appellant's  removal  would  not  be  in
    breach of Article 8 of the ECHR. This has not  been  challenged  on  the
    Appellant's behalf.

11.   It is important to appreciate  that  the  only  reason  issue  (a)  is
    advanced is to lay the ground for issue (b).

12.   It should also be noted that we are not concerned with  the  cessation
    provisions  in  this  appeal  because  the  panel's  finding  that   the
    Respondent had  not  shown  that  para  339A(v)  applied  has  not  been
    challenged.

      The relevant provisions

13.   The relevant provisions are set out below:

            The Refugee Convention

         Article 1


         "A. For the purposes of the present Convention, the term  "refugee"
         shall apply to any person who:
         (1)      Has been considered a refugee under the Arrangements of 12
            May 1926 and 30 June  1928  or  under  the  Conventions  of  28
            October 1933 and 10 February 1938, the Protocol of 14 September
            1939  or  the  Constitution  of   the   International   Refugee
            Organization;
            ...
         (2)      ...owing to well-founded  fear  of  being  persecuted  for
            reasons  of  race,  religion,  nationality,  membership  of   a
            particular social group or political opinion,  is  outside  the
            country of his nationality and is  unable  or,  owing  to  such
            fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection  of  that
            country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the
            country of his former habitual residence as a  result  of  such
            events, is unable or, owing  to  such  fear,  is  unwilling  to
            return to it."

            Article 1C

            "This Convention shall cease to  apply  to  any  person  falling
                 under the terms of section A if:

            (5)  He can no longer, because the circumstances  in  connection
            with which he has been recognised as a refugee  have  ceased  to
            exist, continue to refuse to avail himself of the protection  of
            the country of nationality;
                       Provided that this para shall not apply to a  refugee
            falling under section A(1) of this Article who is able to invoke
            compelling reasons  arising  out  of  previous  persecution  for
            refusing to avail himself of the protection of  the  country  of
            nationality.
            (6)  ..."

            Article 33

                       "Prohibition of expulsion or return ('refoulement')

        "1.      No Contracting State shall expel or return ('refouler')  a
           refugee in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories
           where his life or freedom would be threatened on account of  his
           race, religion, nationality, membership of a  particular  social
           group or political opinion.


        2. The benefit of  the  present  provision  may  not,  however,  be
           claimed  by a refugee whom  there  are  reasonable  grounds  for
           regarding as a danger to the security of the country in which he
           is, or who, having been convicted by  a  final  judgement  of  a
           particularly  serious  crime,  constitutes  a  danger   to   the
           community of that country."

            Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002

      "72. Serious Criminal


        (1)      This section applies for the purpose of  the  construction
           and application of  Article  33(2)  of  the  Refugee  Convention
           (exclusion from protection).


        (2)      A person shall be presumed to have  been  convicted  by  a
           final judgment of a particularly serious crime and to constitute
           a danger to the community of the United Kingdom if he is -


             (a)  convicted in the United Kingdom of an offence, and


             (b)  sentenced to a period of  imprisonment  of  at  least  two
             years."

            The Immigration Rules

         "Grant of Asylum


         334.    An asylum applicant will be granted asylum in  the  United
                Kingdom if the Secretary of State is satisfied that:
           (i)   he is in the United Kingdom or has arrived at  a  port  of
                      entry in the United Kingdom;
           (ii)  he is a refugee, as defined by  the  [Refugee]  Convention
         and protocol;
                 and
           (iii)  refusing  his  application  would  result  in  him  being
                      required to go (whether immediately or after the  time
                      limited by any existing leave to enter or  remain)  in
                      breach of the Convention and Protocol, to a country in
                      which his life  or  freedom  would  be  threatened  on
                      account of his race, religion, nationality,  political
                      opinion or membership of a particular social group."


      "Revocation or refusal to renew a grant of asylum


      339A.      A person's grant of asylum under  paragraph  334  will  be
                revoked  or  not  renewed  if  the  Secretary  of  State  is
                satisfied that:


                  ...


                  (v)  he  can  no  longer,  because  the  circumstances  in
                      connection with which he  has  been  recognised  as  a
                      refugee have ceased to exist, continue  to  refuse  to
                      avail himself of the  protection  of  the  country  of
                      nationality;


                  ...


                  (ix) there are reasonable grounds for regarding him  as  a
                      danger to the security of the United Kingdom; or


                  ...


                  (x)  having been  convicted  by  a  final  judgment  of  a
                      particularly serious crime he constitutes a danger  to
                      the community of the United Kingdom.


                 In considering (v) and (vi), the Secretary of State  shall
                have regard to whether the change  of  circumstances  is  of
                such significant and non-temporary nature that the refugee's
                fear of persecution can  no  longer  be  regarded  as  well-
                founded.


                 Where an application for asylum was made on  or  after  21
                October 2004, the Secretary of State will revoke  or  refuse
                to renew a person's grant of asylum where  he  is  satisfied
                that at least one of the provisions  in  sub-paragraph  (i)-
                (vi) apply."


      Asylum and Immigration Appeals Act 1993 (the 1993 Act)


      "1.   Interpretation

            In this Act-

            'the Convention' means the Convention relating to the Status  of
            Refugees done in Geneva on 28 July 1951  and  the  Protocol  to
            that Convention.


      2.    Primacy of Convention


            Nothing in the immigration rules (within the meaning of the 1971
            Act) shall lay down any practice which would be contrary to  the
            Convention."


      The Qualification Directive


      "THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,


      Whereas:


          (3)     The Geneva Convention and Protocol provide the cornerstone
            of  the  international  legal  regime  for  the  protection  of
            refugees.


          (30) Within the  limits  set  out  by  international  obligations,
            Member States may lay down that the granting of  benefits  with
            regard to access to employment, social welfare, health care and
            access to integration facilities requires the prior issue of  a
            residence permit.


          Article 1


          "Subject matter and scope


          The purpose of this Directive is to lay down minimum standards for
         the qualification of third country nationals or stateless  persons
         as  refugees  or  as  persons  who  otherwise  need  international
         protection and the content of the protection granted."


          Article 2


          "Definitions


          For the purposes of this Directive:


          (a)      'international  protection'   means   the   refugee   and

            status of refugees done at Geneva on 28 July 1951,  as  amended
            by the New York Protocol of 31 January 1967;


          (c)     'refugee' means a third country national who, owing  to  a
            well-founded fear of being  persecuted  for  reasons  of  race,
            religion, nationality, political opinion  or  membership  of  a
            particular social group, is outside the country of  nationality
            and is unable or, owing to such a fear, is unwilling  to  avail
            himself or herself of the protection  of  that  country,  or  a
            stateless person, who, being outside of the country  of  former
            habitual residence for the same reasons as mentioned above,  is
            unable or, owing to such fear, unwilling to return to  it,  and
            to whom Article 12 does not apply;


          (d)     'refugee status' means the recognition by a  Member  State
            of a  third  country  national  or  a  stateless  person  as  a

      "Cessation


      1.   A third country national or a stateless person shall cease to be
         a refugee, if he or she:


            (e)   can no longer, because  the  circumstances  in  connection
                with which he or she has been recognised as a  refugee  have
                ceased to exist, continue to  refuse  to  avail  himself  or
                herself of the protection of the country of nationality;


      2.   In considering points (e) and (f) of paragraph 1, Member  States
            shall have regard to whether the change of circumstances  is  of
            such a significant and non-temporary nature that  the  refugee's
            fear of persecution can no longer be regarded as well-founded."



            Article 13

            "Granting of refugee status

            Member States shall grant refugee  status  to  a  third  country
         national or a stateless person, who  qualifies  as  a  refugee  in
         accordance with Chapters II and III."

            Article 14


      "Revocation of, ending of or refusal to renew refugee status


      1.   Concerning applications for international protection filed after
            the entry into force of  this  Directive,  Member  States  shall
            revoke, end or refuse to renew the refugee  status  of  a  third
            country  national  or  a   stateless   person   granted   by   a
            governmental, administrative, judicial or  quasi-judicial  body,
            if he or she has ceased to  be  a  refugee  in  accordance  with
            Article 11.


      4.   Member States may revoke, end or  refuse  to  renew  the  status
            granted to a refugee by a governmental, administrative, judicial
            or quasi-judicial body, when:

            (a)   there are reasonable grounds for regarding him or her as a
                danger to the security of the Member State in  which  he  or
                she is present;


            (b)   he or she, having been convicted by a final judgement of a
                particularly serious crime,  constitutes  a  danger  to  the
                community of that Member State.


      5.   In situations described in paragraph 4, Member States may decide
            not to grant status to a refugee, where such a decision has  not
            yet been taken."


      Article 21

        "Protection from refoulement


        1.        Member  States  shall  respect  the  principle  of   non-
           refoulement in accordance with their international obligations.

        2.  Where not prohibited by the international obligations mentioned
           in paragraph 1, Member States may  refoule  a  refugee,  whether
           formally    recognised or not, when:


                 a) there are reasonable grounds for considering him or her
                    as a danger to the security  of  the  Member  State  in
                    which he or she is present; or
                 b) he or she, having been convicted by a  final  judgement
                    of a particularly serious crime, constitutes  a  danger
                    to the community of that Member State.


        3. Member States may revoke, end or refuse to renew or to grant the
           residence permit of (or  to)  a  refugee  to  whom  paragraph  2
           applies."


      Article 24

        "Residence permits


        1.       As soon as possible after their status has  been  granted,
           Member States shall issue to beneficiaries of refugee  status  a
           residence permit which must be valid for at  least  three  years
           and renewable unless compelling reasons of national security  or
           public order otherwise require, ..."

      The panel's reasons

14.   The panel gave the following  reasons  for  its  conclusion  that  the
    Respondent was entitled to revoke refugee status under para  339A(x)  of
    the  Immigration  Rules.  First,  no  argument  was  advanced   on   the
    Appellant's behalf to suggest that the fact that the Refugee  Convention
    does not provide for revocation of refugee status in circumstances where
    the Immigration Rules do  contain  such  a  provision  should  have  any
    bearing on the lawfulness of the Respondent's decision.

15.   Second, the panel was not persuaded by the contents of a letter  dated
    25 May 2011 from the  United  Nations  High  Commissioner  for  Refugees
    (UNHCR). It noted that the UNHCR drew attention to  the  fact  that  the
    Refugee Convention does not provide for revocation of refugee status and
    said that the Respondent's guidance (reflected in para  339A(x)  of  the
    Immigration Rules) was "not in keeping with  international  norms".  The
    panel also noted that there was no legal authority for the suggestion in
    the UNHCR's letter to the  effect  that  the  Immigration  Rules  cannot
    provide for revocation of refugee  status  in  circumstances  where  the
    Refugee Convention only allowed for refoulement of  the  refugee  rather
    than the revocation of refugee status.

16.   Third, the panel considered that Parliament had intended to  create  a
    provision allowing for the revocation of refugee status in circumstances
    where the refugee Convention only allowed for  the  refoulement  of  the
    refugee. In this regard, the panel quoted from, and  relied  upon,  para
    124 of IH (s.72; 'Particularly  Serious  Crime')  Eritrea  [2009]  UKAIT
    00012, which reads:

             "In  our  view,  Mr  Draycott's  submission  (scaled  down   or
           otherwise) is doomed to fail in  the  light  of  the  clear  and
           unchallenged statements of the law  in  the  speeches  of  Lords
           Bingham of Cornhill and Hope of Craighead in Asfaw.  There is no
           suggestion that any of the other members of the House disagreed.
            As a result,  in  our  judgment,  the  'incorporation'  of  the
           Refugee Convention into English Law effected by s.2 of the  1993
           Act is limited to that provision's impact upon  the  content  of
           immigration rules or any wider policy.  Of course, the  Tribunal
           must, when called upon to do so, deal with the argument that  an
           individual's removal in consequence of a particular  immigration
           decision will be a breach of the Refugee Convention.  That  much
           follows from the statutory ground of appeal  in  s.84(1)((g)  of
           the 2002 Act.  Beyond that however,  at  its  highest,  reliance
           upon the Refugee  Convention  is  confined  to  the  established
           interpretative axiom that  when  construing  legislation  giving
           effect to a treaty obligation Parliament should be taken to have
           intended to give effect to  that  treaty's  terms  unless  clear
           contrary words are used.   The problem faced by Mr  Draycott  in
           this appeal is that Parliament both in s.72 and the  2004  Order
           has  clearly  done  just  that.   Parliament  has  unambiguously
           presumed to lay down a meaning of  some  of  the  words  in  the
           Convention, despite any autonomous  international  meaning  that
           those words might  have.  No  ordinary  principle  of  statutory
           interpretation in English Law could led to a  different  reading
           of s.72(4) read with s.72(6)  -  the  presumption  that  certain
           crimes are per se "particularly serious" ones is irrefutable."

17.   The panel gave its reasons for its conclusion that the  Appellant  had
    not shown that he was at real risk of Article 3 ill-treatment in Vietnam
    at para 47 of the determination. It rejected the Appellant's  contention
    that there would be investigations into his links and his family's past,
    which it considered was not supported by any  background  material.  The
    panel noted that the Appellant's father, upon whom the entire family had
    based their fear of return, had returned to Vietnam  without  difficulty
    more than once. The Appellant's elder brother and sister, both  of  whom
    had left Vietnam as adults, had also been able to return to Vietnam on a
    number of occasions. The panel  found  it  wholly  incredible  that  the
    Appellant's elder brother, who left Vietnam at the age of  26  with  his
    wife and children, had no idea why his father had left Vietnam with  his
    wife and children, if there was some specific reason for their departure
    rather than  the  general  situation  existing  in  Vietnam.  The  panel
    accepted that  in  returning  to  Vietnam  the  Appellant's  father  and
    siblings had been able to do so with the protection and security of  the
    British nationality but it  found  it  incredible,  if  there  had  been
    specific adverse interest in the family, that they would have taken  the
    risk of returning to Vietnam.

      Assessment

      Issue (a)

18.   The Appellant is a person who has been granted refugee status  and  is
    lawfully in the United Kingdom as such. However,  he  is  not  protected
    from removal by Article 33(2) of the Refugee Convention, because of  his
    conviction for murder and wounding with intent to cause grievous  bodily
    harm and the unchallenged finding that he constitutes a  danger  to  the
    community.

19.   The Refugee Convention is the basic document  in  refugee  protection.
    It has wide acceptance throughout the world. Its terms have been adopted
    and expanded in a number of other countries  and  regions.  One  of  the
    regions is that of the  European  Union.  The  adoption  of  a  regional
    instrument relating to  refugee  protection  cannot  dispense  from  the
    obligations of individual  State  parties  to  the  Refugee  Convention.
    Rather, a regional instrument may introduce provisions that  are  to  be
    seen as alongside and supportive of those obligations. The Qualification
    Directive is such an instrument. Its preamble makes the primacy  of  the
    Refugee Convention clear, but the incidents of recognition as a  refugee
    under the Qualification Directive (which we shall call "European refugee
    status") are in some respects different  from  those  envisaged  by  the
    Refugee Convention. For example,  it  is  clear  that  European  refugee
    status may itself be subject to restrictions: but it  is  equally  clear
    that restrictions on European refugee status do not of themselves affect
    an individual's rights under the Refugee Convention in any State that is
    a party to the latter.

20.   The provisions of  the  Refugee  Convention  which  are  that  in  the
    circumstances of a case like this, a person remains  a  refugee  but  is
    removable, are apparently inconsistent with those of  Article  14(4)  of
    the Qualification Directive and para 339A(x) of  the  Immigration  Rules
    which provide for revocation of his status.  There  are  three  possible
    ways of dealing with this argument. The first is to say  that  there  is
    such  an  inconsistency  and  that  the  Qualification  Directive  takes
    precedence over the Refugee Convention. The second is the say that there
    is  such  an  inconsistency   and  that  the  Refugee  Convention  takes
    precedence over the Qualification Directive and the  Immigration  Rules.
    The third is to say that the  status revoked under those  provisions  is
    different from the individual's status under the Refugee Convention  and
    that there is in fact no inconsistency.  The third is the right  answer,
    in our judgment. Our reasons are as follows:

21.   A person is a refugee if he satisfies the definition of a  refugee  in
    the Refugee Convention. This is so even  if  his  status  has  not  been
    recognised by the Contracting  State  in  question.  The  view  that  an
    individual's status as a refugee exists independently of any recognition
    of his status is supported by paragraph 28 of the foreword to  the  1979
    UNHCR Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status
    (cited by Lord Brown in Hoxha v. Special Adjudicator [2005] UKHL 19):

            "28.  A person is a refugee  within  the  meaning  of  the  1951
                 Convention as soon as he fulfils the criteria contained  in
                 the definition. This would necessarily occur prior  to  the
                 time at which his refugee status  is  formally  determined.
                 Recognition of his refugee status does not  therefore  make
                 him a refugee but declares him  to  be  one.  He  does  not
                 become a refugee because of recognition, but is  recognized
                 because he is a refugee."

22.   Article 1A of the  Refugee  Convention  itself  distinguishes  between
    those who have been recognised as refugees  (see  Article  1A(1),  which
    refers to a person who "has been considered a refugee ...") and a person
    who  satisfies  the  definition  in  Article   1A(2).   Accordingly,   a
    distinction needs to be drawn between a  refugee  simpliciter  (one  who
    objectively  satisfies  the  definition)  and  a  person  who  has  been
    recognised as a refugee.

23.   That this distinction exists was clearly established  in  Hoxha.  This
    has been more recently confirmed in the judgment of the Supreme Court in
    R (on application of ST (Eritrea)) v. SSHD [2012] UKSC 12 upholding  the
    judgment of the Court of Appeal in the case  in  SSHD  v.  ST  (Eritrea)
    [2010] EWCA Civ 643.

24.   Apart from Article 28 of the Refugee Convention,  which  provides  for
    Contracting States to  issue  to  refugees  lawfully  staying  in  their
    territory travel documents for  the  purpose  of  travel  outside  their
    territory, there is no provision under the Refugee  Convention  for  any
    document to be issued to a refugee in recognition  of  the  individual's
    status as a refugee, nor is there any provision for the grant of  asylum
    or the grant  of  any  form  of  leave.  Even  where  an  individual  is
    recognised as a refugee, this does not, of itself,  confer  a  right  to
    remain in the United Kingdom, as Stanley Burnton LJ said in ST (Eritrea)
    (para 53). If it were otherwise, a refugee with a right of residence  in
    a safe third country would have a right to remain in the United Kingdom.



25.   In  contrast  to  the  fact  that  the  Refugee  Convention  makes  no
    provision for the grant of leave to a refugee or for  the  status  of  a
    refugee to be recognised, Article  13  of  the  Qualification  Directive
    requires Members States to "grant refugee  status  to  a  third  country
    national ....., who qualifies as a refugee in accordance  with  Chapters
    II and III."  It should be noted that, whereas some  of  its  provisions
    import the equivalent provision of the Refugee Convention by  using  the
    same words and others make a specific reference to a particular  article
    of the Refugee Convention, Article 13 refers to a person "who  qualifies
    as  a  refugee  in  accordance  with  Chapters  II  and  III"   of   the
    Qualification Directive. The use of this language is intentional, in our
    view.  In the case of such a  person,  Member  States  are  required  by
    Article 24 to issue a residence permit "which must be valid for at least
    three years  and  renewable  unless  ...".  The  requirement  under  the
    Qualification Directive for residence permits to be issued goes  further
    than the Refugee Convention, as the Supreme Court noted in ST  (Eritrea)
    (para 45).  Since  the  scheme  of  the  Qualification  Directive  makes
    provision for the grant  of  residence  permits  to  an  individual  who
    qualifies as a refugee under its provisions, it makes sense for there to
    be provisions to revoke those permits where an individual is  no  longer
    entitled to it under its terms. In our view, this is the  rationale  for
    the provisions in  the  Immigration  Rules  which  give  effect  to  the
    Qualification Directive and which permit the Respondent to "revoke,  end
    or refuse  to  renew"  a  grant  of  asylum  in  certain  circumstances,
    including those set out in para 339A.

26.   In other words, what Article 14 permits Member States to "revoke,  end
    or refuse to renew" is the status that was granted by that Member  State
    to the individual pursuant to its obligations  under  the  Qualification
    Directive. It is therefore  necessary  to  distinguish  between  refugee
    status granted pursuant to the provisions of the Qualification Directive
    and  refugee  status  under  the   Refugee   Convention   which   exists
    independently of any recognition. We have already referred to the former
    as "European refugee status" to distinguish it from refugee status under
    the Refugee Convention. Given that section 2 of the 1993  Act  prohibits
    the Immigration Rules from laying down any practice that is contrary  to
    the Refugee Convention, the provision in para 339A for revocation or non-
    renewal of the grant of  asylum  can  only  refer  to  European  refugee
    status. In other words, the true effect of  any  revocation  under  para
    339A(x), when  read  with  the  Qualification  Directive,  is  that  the
    individual's European refugee status is revoked.  Such  revocation  does
    not affect the individual's status under the Refugee Convention.

27.   These conclusions do not seem to us to be materially affected  by  the
    fact that the Refugee Convention is not strictly a part of  the  law  of
    the United Kingdom or of community law. Its provisions are given primacy
    by both and it is in our judgment inconceivable that  the  Qualification
    Directive dispensed with  the  benefits  it  provides.  Of  course,  the
    Immigration Rules cannot lawfully do so, given that  section  2  of  the
    1993 Act makes it clear that nothing in the Immigration Rules shall  lay
    down any practice which would be contrary to the Refugee Convention.

28.   Our interpretation, that the revocation etc permitted  by  Article  14
    concerns European refugee  status  and  not  refugee  status  under  the
    Refugee Convention, makes sense when one considers that preamble  30  of
    the Qualification Directive specifically provides  that  "Member  States
    may lay down that the granting of benefits  with  regard  to  access  to
    employment, social  welfare,  health  care  and  access  to  integration
    facilities requires the prior issue of a residence permit."

29.   Given that there is no inconsistency between (on  the  one  hand)  the
    Refugee  Convention  and  (on  the  other  hand)  para  339A(x)  of  the
    Immigration Rules and Articles 14 and 21 of the Qualification Directive,
    there is no need to make any reference to the CJEU.

30.   We therefore agree with the opinion of the UNHCR in its  letter  dated
    25 May 2011 that the words "status granted  to  a  refugee"  in  Article
    14(4) of the Directive refers to the "asylum status" granted by a Member
    State under the Qualification Directive rather than being a  refugee  in
    the sense of Article 1A(2) of the 1951 Convention. The panel had  before
    it a complete copy of the UNHCR's letter  which,  insofar  as  relevant,
    reads:

             "UNHCR  finds   [the   Secretary   of   State's   guidance   on
           Cancellation, Cessation & Revocation of Refugee Status]  not  to
           be in keeping with international refugee norms and continues  to
           consider it to be an inappropriate use of the cessation  clauses
           if they  are  invoked  on  the  basis  that  an  individual  has
           committed a crime and  the  country  of  refuge  is  looking  to
           withdraw refugee status  in  order  to  be  able  to  expel  the
           individual on this basis, rather than for one of the reasons set
           out in Articles 1C (1) to (6) of the 1951 Convention.  The  fact
           that a refugee has been  convicted  of  a  criminal  offence  is
           irrelevant and should not be taken into account  when  making  a
           decision  on  the  application  of  Article  1C  of   the   1951
           Convention.  It should be noted that the cessation  clauses  are
           negative in character and exhaustively enumerated.

           In making this comment, UNHCR appreciates that Article  14(4)(b)
           of  the  European  Council  Qualification  Directive  2004/83/EC
           repeats the provisions of the second paragraph of Article  33(2)
           as a ground for States to "revoke, end or refuse  to  renew  the
           status granted to a refugee".  UNCHR continues to reiterate that
           Article 14(4) of this Directive runs  the  risk  of  introducing
           substantive modifications to the exclusion and cessation clauses
           of the 1951 Convention, by adding the provision of Article 33(2)
           of the 1951 Convention as a basis for exclusion, revocation,  or
           termination of refugee status.  Assimilating the  exceptions  of
           the non-refoulement principle permitted under Article  33(2)  to
           the exclusion clauses of Article  1F  or  to  Article  1C  would
           therefore be incompatible with the 1951  Convention.   To  avoid
           such an outcome, "status granted to a refugee" in Article  14(4)
           of the Directive is therefore understood to refer to the  asylum
           ("status") granted by a State rather than refugee status in  the
           sense of Article 1A(2) of the 1951 Convention."

31.   Although this  appeal  only  concerns  the  effect  of  revocation  or
    refusal to renew in circumstances falling within para 339A(x), the  same
    reasoning must apply to para 339A(ix), which mirrors the other  scenario
    in Article 33(2) where refoulement of a refugee is permitted  under  the
    Refugee Convention. We have not considered the remaining  provisions  of
    para 339A,  which  include  the  cessation  provisions  in  the  Refugee
    Convention.

32.   The panel concluded that the Respondent was  entitled  to  revoke  the
    Appellant's refugee status.  It  is  plain  that  it  had  in  mind  the
    Appellant's refugee status  under  the  Refugee  Convention,  not  least
    because of its rejection of the opinion in the UNHCR's letter.  For  the
    reasons given above, we are satisfied that the panel  erred  in  law  in
    concluding that the Respondent was entitled to  revoke  the  Appellant's
    refugee status under the Refugee Convention.

33.   However, there is another  reason  why  the  panel  erred  in  law  in
    reaching this conclusion. This arises from the final paragraph  of  para
    339A, which provides that, where an application for asylum was  made  on
    or after 21 October 2004, the Respondent will revoke or refuse to  renew
    a person's grant of asylum where she is satisfied that at least  one  of
    the provisions in sub-paragraphs (i) to (vi) apply. This  is  consistent
    with Article 14.1 which requires  Members  States  to  "revoke,  end  or
    refuse to renew" refugee status if an individual  has  ceased  to  be  a
    refugee in accordance with Article 11 of the Qualification Directive and
    the individual's application for asylum was made on or after the date on
    which the Directive came into force. The  Qualification  Directive  came
    into force on 20 October 2004.

34.   One possible interpretation of the final paragraph of para 339A is  to
    say that the power to revoke or refuse to renew an individual's grant of
    asylum is not available if an asylum  application  was  made  before  21
    October 2004; it is only available if an asylum application was made  on
    or after 21 October 2004 and at least one  of  the  provisions  in  sub-
    paragraphs (i) to (vi) apply.

35.   The second is to say that, in the case of an asylum  application  made
    before 21 October 2004, the power is available if any  one  of  the  ten
    possibilities in para 339A  applies  but,  in  the  case  of  an  asylum
    application made on or after  21  October  2004,  only  if  one  of  the
    provisions in sub-paragraphs (i) to (vi) apply.

36.   The second interpretation runs the clear risk  of  having  the  result
    that, in the case of an asylum application made before 21 October  2004,
    the Immigration Rules permit a practice that is contrary to the  Refugee
    Convention because there is nothing  in  the  Refugee  Convention  which
    allows for the revocation of status; and the conditions expressed in sub-
    paragraphs (vii) - (x) are expressed  more  widely  than  the  exclusion
    provisions in the Convention. It is also inconsistent with the principle
    that refugee status under  the  Refugee  Convention  is  something  that
    exists independently of any recognition by a Contracting State.

37.   We therefore prefer the first interpretation, which  gives  effect  to
    section 2 of the 1993 Act which provides that nothing in the Immigration
    Rules shall lay down any practice which would be contrary to the Refugee
    Convention.

38.   Accordingly, the Respondent's decision  to  invoke  para  339A(x)  can
    have no effect, because the Appellant was recognised as a refugee in the
    late 1980s or early 1990s, nearly fifteen years before the date referred
    to in the final para of para 339A; he has  never  had  European  refugee
    status. The Appellant's status remains  that  of  a  refugee  under  the
    Refugee Convention.

39.   However, the errors made by the panel as identified above do not  make
    any difference to the outcome and therefore do not justify  the  setting
    aside of the decision of the panel. As  stated  at  para  4  above,  the
    Appellant's removal would not be in breach of  the  Refugee  Convention.
    The only reason for issue (a) to be advanced on the  Appellant's  behalf
    is to lay the ground for issue (b). For the reasons  we  give  below  in
    relation to issue (b), we are satisfied that the panel  was  correct  to
    determine the Article 3 claim without applying a  presumption  that  the
    Appellant's removal  would  be  in  breach  of  Article  3,  albeit  for
    different reasons. The result is that issue (a) is not relevant  to  the
    outcome of this appeal.

      Issue (b)

40.   Ms. Daykin did not refer us  to  any  authority  for  the  proposition
    that, for as long as an  individual  has  refugee  status,  there  is  a
    presumption that his or her removal would be in breach of Article 3.  We
    reject this proposition, which we consider is simply wrong. The extracts
    we quote below from decided cases of the European Court of Human  Rights
    (to which we were not referred) settle the  issue  so  clearly  that  no
    further discussion is required on our part:

      Saadi v. Italy, no.37201/06, 28.02.2008, [2008] ECHR 179


        "133.     With regard to the material date,  the  existence  of  the
           risk must be assessed primarily with reference  to  those  facts
           which were known or ought to have been known to the  Contracting
           State at the time of expulsion. However, if  the  applicant  has
           not yet been extradited or deported when the Court examines  the
           case, the relevant time will be that of the  proceedings  before
           the  Court  (see  Chahal,  cited  above,  �� 85  and  86,  and
           Venkadajalasarma v. the Netherlands,  no. 58510/00,  � 63,  17
           February 2004). This situation typically arises when, as in  the
           present case, deportation or extradition is delayed as a  result
           of an indication by  the  Court  of  an  interim  measure  under
           Rule 39 of the Rules of Court (see Mamatkulov and Askarov, cited
           above, � 69). Accordingly, while  it  is  true  that  historical
           facts are of interest in so  far  as  they  shed  light  on  the
           current situation and the way  it  is  likely  to  develop,  the
           present circumstances are decisive. "

                 Sufi & Elmi v the United Kingdom [2011] ECHR 1045

            "1.  General principles applicable in expulsion cases


        1. If the applicant has not yet been extradited  or  deported  when
           the Court examines the case, the relevant time will be  that  of
           the proceedings before the Court  (see  Saadi  v.  Italy,  cited
           above, � 133). A full and ex nunc assessment is  called  for  as
           the situation in a country of  destination  may  change  in  the
           course of time.  Even  though  the  historical  position  is  of
           interest in so far as it may shed light on the current situation
           and its likely evolution, it is the present conditions which are
           decisive and it is therefore  necessary  to  take  into  account
           information that has come to  light  after  the  final  decision
           taken by the  domestic  authorities  (see  Salah  Sheekh,  cited
           above, � 136, [2007] ECHR 36).


        1. The foregoing principles, and in particular the need to  examine
           all the facts of the case, require  that  this  assessment  must
           focus on the foreseeable consequences  of  the  removal  of  the
           applicant to the country of destination...


        1. ... the sole question for the Court to consider in an  expulsion
           case is whether, in all the circumstances of the case before it,
           substantial grounds have  been  shown  for  believing  that  the
           person concerned, if returned, would face a real risk  of  being
           subjected  to  treatment  contrary   to   Article   3   of   the
           Convention...

41.   The fact that an individual is a refugee or has been recognised  as  a
    refugee in the past does not mean that there is any legal or  evidential
    presumption that removal to his or her country  will  be  in  breach  of
    Article 3. Where an individual's asylum and Article 3 claims are decided
    at the same time and it is found that removal would be in breach of  the
    Refugee Convention, a real risk of Article 3 ill-treatment will  usually
    also be found. This will usually be because the  factual  basis  is  the
    same, the risk factors are the same and the feared ill-treatment amounts
    to both persecution and inhuman or degrading treatment, and not  because
    of the existence of any presumption of Article 3 risk arising  from  the
    fact that the asylum claim was successful.

42.   However, where an individual was recognised a refugee  at  some  point
    in the past, the past may be relevant in shedding light on  the  current
    situation and the prospective Article 3 risk but  it  remains  the  case
    that the question whether there  is  a  real  risk  of  Article  3  ill-
    treatment must be answered at the date of  the  proceedings  before  the
    court and is forward looking.

43.   The panel misdirected itself in assuming that there was a  presumption
    of a real risk of Article 3 ill-treatment for so long as  an  individual
    is a refugee. It did not err in  assessing  the  Appellant's  Article  3
    claim on the basis that it was for him  to  establish  a  real  risk  of
    treatment in breach of Article 3.

      Summary of conclusions

(i)   The Qualification Directive sets out minimum standards for  qualifying
    for refugee protection to be applied by Member States. It also  requires
    Member States to grant refugee status to a person  who  qualifies  as  a
    refugee under its provisions (Article  13)  and  to  issue  a  residence
    permit to such a person (Article 21). These requirements go further than
    the Refugee Convention.

(ii)  A decision to revoke or refuse to renew a grant of asylum  under  para
    339A of the Immigration Rules only relates to  the  individual's  status
    under the Qualification Directive (European refugee status) and not  his
    status under the Refugee Convention. However, it is necessary to bear in
    mind that the circumstances under which para 339A is  invoked  may  also
    result in a cessation clause under the Refugee Convention applying.

(iii) A decision to revoke or refuse to renew a grant of asylum  under  para
    339A can only apply to cases in which the asylum application was made on
    or after 21 October 2004 and at least one  of  the  provisions  in  sub-
    paragraphs (i)-(vi) of para 339A of the Immigration Rules applies.

(iv)  The effect of the final paragraph of  para  339A  read  together  with
    section 2 of the 1993 Act is that any purported decision  to  revoke  or
    refuse to renew a grant  of  asylum  in  a  case  in  which  the  asylum
    application was made before 21 October 2004 cannot have  any  effect  on
    the  individual's  recognition  of  refugee  status  under  the  Refugee
    Convention. He accordingly continues to be entitled to the  benefits  of
    that Convention, subject of course to the limitations in,  for  example,
    Articles 32 and 33.

(v)   If an individual was granted refugee status some time  ago,  there  is
    no legal or evidential presumption that, for so long as he is a  refugee
    under the Refugee Convention, removal would be in breach of  Article  3.
    Whilst the past may  be  relevant  in  shedding  light  on  the  current
    situation and the prospective Article 3 risk, it remains the  case  that
    the question whether there is a real risk  of  Article  3  ill-treatment
    must be answered at the date of the hearing and is forward-looking.

      Decision:

      The First-tier Tribunal did err in law.  The Appellant  is  a  refugee
    but is not immune from removal to Vietnam.  Any  entitlement  under  the
    Qualification Directive has been validly revoked. His removal to Vietnam
    is not shown to breach Article 3. For those reasons, we  set  aside  the
    First-tier Tribunal's decision and now dismiss his appeal.
