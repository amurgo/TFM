                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. This is an appeal  brought  by  the  Appellant,  Mr  Ali,  against  the
    decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  O'Malley  (Judge  O'Malley),
    promulgated on 22 April 2015, in which she dismissed his  appeal.  That
    appeal in turn was against the decision  of  the  Respondent,  dated  9
    September 2014, to refuse the Appellant's application to vary his leave
    to remain as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) and to  make  a  removal  decision
    under Section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.

 2. The basis of the Respondent's refusal of the application was  a  narrow
    one. It was said that the Appellant had failed to submit advertising or
    marketing materials covering a continuous period commencing  before  11
    July 2014 and up to no earlier than three months before the date of the
    application. The relevant provisions of the Immigration Rules relied on
    was paragraph 245DD(b), with reference to  paragraph  41-SD(e)(iii)  of
    Appendix A to those Rules.

 3. On appeal to Judge O'Malley  it  was  accepted  that  the  Respondent's
    appeal bundle did not contain all of  the  evidence  submitted  by  the
    Appellant with  the  application  (see  paragraph  24  of  the  judge's
    decision). The judge accepted that certain items of evidence which were
    not in the bundle had in fact been submitted with the  application,  in
    particular an advert in the  Ilford  Recorder  and  an  advert  on  the
    Gumtree website. However both of these items postdated 11 July 2014.

 4. The judge did not accept that an invoice dated 10 June 2014 had in fact
    been included with the application. This finding  was  based  upon  the
    Appellant's own witness statement at paragraph 12. The  judge  accepted
    that the Appellant had registered the domain name for his website on 26
    June 2014, and that he had requested flyers and business cards in  June
    of that year. However, it appears that he  did  not  accept  that  this
    evidence was before the decision-maker. It was also said that  even  if
    the  invoice  referred  to  previously  had  been  submitted  with  the
    application it was not sufficient to show that  the  relevant  material
    had been published locally or nationally as required by the Rules,  and
    this conclusion was based upon the fact that  the  Appellant  had  only
    distributed his headed letter  paper  for  the  use  of  drawing  up  a
    contract. This, in the judge's view, did not constitute publishing.

 5. The Appellant sought permission to appeal.  This  was  refused  in  the
    first instance by the First-tier Tribunal but was  renewed  in  lengthy
    grounds of appeal to the Upper  Tribunal.  Permission  was  granted  by
    Upper Tribunal Judge Goldstein on 24 August 2015.

The hearing before me

 6. Before me, Mr Saini, Counsel for the Appellant, sought to rely  on  the
    grounds. In the first instance he submitted  that  the  fact  that  the
    Appellant had his own website prior to 11 July 2014 was  sufficient  to
    satisfy the alternative limb within paragraph 41-SD-(e)(iii)(1) because
    the existence of the  website  amounted  to  advertising  the  services
    provided by the Appellant's company.

 7. Secondly, Mr Saini submitted that the  judge  had  failed  to  properly
    address the issue of the other evidence submitted with the application,
    in particular business cards and the flyers. Although  it  is  accepted
    that the question of what was or was not submitted with the application
    was not entirely clear from the papers before us,  Mr  Saini  submitted
    that  the  judge  had  not  taken  any  credibility  issues  with   the
    Appellant's evidence and had failed to address the flyers and  business
    cards adequately or at all when reaching his findings. I  was  referred
    to particular pages in the Appellant's consolidated bundle and evidence
    which was said to have been submitted with the application. The invoice
    mentioned by  the  judge  was  simply  corroborative  evidence  of  the
    purchasing of the  flyers  and  business  cards.  Mr  Saini  sought  to
    resurrect ground 5 of the grounds, a ground upon  which  permission  to
    appeal was expressly refused by Upper Tribunal Judge Goldstein.

 8. A final point made by Mr Saini was that the change in the Rules brought
    about by HC535 in respect of the  need  to  show  a  continuous  period
    rendered the decision under appeal not in accordance with  the  law  as
    the  imposition  of  a  retrospective  requirement  by  the  Rules  was
    unreasonable.

 9. For the Respondent, Mr Bramble submitted that when one  looked  at  the
    wording of the particular provision in question,  "trading"  must  mean
    something more than simply online advertising,  as  reference  to  such
    advertising was made prior  to  the  use  of  the  word  "or"  in  that
    subparagraph. There was no evidence in this case that the Appellant had
    in fact been trading in the sense of conducting  business  through  his
    website. In respect of the other materials referred to  previously,  in
    particular the business cards and the flyers, Mr Bramble  asked  me  to
    look at paragraphs 12 and 18 of the witness statements,  and  paragraph
    26 of the judge's decision.

10. It was submitted that paragraph 30 of the  decision  referred  back  to
    paragraphs 26 and 28, and when one looked at the decision  as  a  whole
    the judge's findings were sustainable. Mr Bramble accepted that if  the
    judge was wrong in the way that he dealt  with  the  witness  statement
    evidence and the issue of the materials submitted with the application,
    the flyers and business cards could in fact meet  the  requirements  of
    the Rules if they were published locally or nationally. He objected  to
    the attempted resurrection of ground 5 of the grounds of appeal.

Decision on Error of Law

11. I find that the judge has made material errors of law in this case.

12. It  is  clear  that  the  evidential  position  before  the  judge  was
    unsatisfactory in  certain  respects.  The  Respondent  had  failed  to
    include all of the evidence  submitted  with  the  application  in  her
    bundle. The Appellant's witness statement is not as clear as  it  might
    have been and there are elements of the Rules themselves which are  not
    entirely straightforward. Having said that I find the judge has  failed
    to make clear findings and/or has failed to  provide  adequate  reasons
    for her conclusions in material respects.

13. First, it is clear to me  that  the  judge  had  no  issue  as  to  the
    Appellant's credibility (see for example paragraph 27 of her decision).
    [She] She should therefore have regarded the  Appellant's  evidence  as
    being truthful. In light of that, and  having  regard  to  the  witness
    statement as a whole, the  judge  should  have  taken  account  of  the
    Appellant's evidence that he had submitted relevant marketing materials
    together with his application, notwithstanding their omission from  the
    Respondent's bundle. If the judge was to make sustainable  findings  to
    the contrary, adequate reasons were required to be provided, and in  my
    view no such reasons are set out on the face of the decision.

14. In respect of paragraphs 26 and 27 of the decision, it appears to me on
    a fair reading of these passages that the  judge  has  focused  on  the
    invoice referred to previously and has failed to engage  properly  with
    the flyers and business cards themselves.

15. In respect of paragraph 34 of the decision, the judge's conclusion that
    relevant material had not been  published  locally  or  nationally  was
    based solely upon the distribution of the headed letter  paper.  In  my
    view this was too narrow a basis upon which to  found  the  conclusion,
    and it failed to have any regard to the other  items  of  evidence,  in
    particular the business cards and the flyers.

16. Turning to the witness statement evidence, although as I have  said  it
    is not perhaps as clear as it might have been, on a fair reading of the
    statement as a whole, in particular the passages between paragraphs  12
    and 20, it is apparent that the Appellant was in effect stating that he
    had in fact marketed and advertised his business before 11  July  2014,
    and that he was relying on the invoice only  as  corroboration  of  his
    obtaining the business cards and the flyers.

17. Having regard to the  Appellant's  consolidated  bundle,  the  relevant
    parts of which it was agreed by both representatives  were  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal, I have looked  at  pages  252  onwards  which  are
    printouts from the Appellant's website. I have also looked at pages 103
    and 104, the former showing one of the business cards in  question  and
    the latter showing the flyer.

18. Mr Saini referred me to the covering letter at  pages  192-195  of  the
    Appellant's bundle, which accompanied the  Appellant's  application  to
    the Respondent. This includes a long list of  evidence  submitted  with
    the application, and on a fair reading of that  list  it  includes  the
    items to which I have referred previously. This information has not  in
    my view been adequately addressed by the judge in her decision,  either
    by way of express consideration or by way of reasons as to why  it  was
    found that these items of evidence had not in fact been submitted  with
    the application, as stated on the face of the evidence.

19. For these reasons I find that the judge has materially erred in law.  I
    find it unnecessary to go on and deal with the other grounds of appeal.



20. I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

Remaking the decision

21. Both representatives were agreed that I could remake  the  decision  on
    the basis of the evidence before me, and that I now do.

22. I find that the Appellant did in fact satisfy the requirements  of  the
    Rules in light of the very narrow basis upon which his application  was
    refused by the Respondent. I accept  that  the  Appellant  himself  has
    provided credible evidence in all material respects. I accept that  the
    evidence to which I have already referred in my decision  was  in  fact
    submitted together with the application to the Respondent (see items 10
    and 14 at page 195 of the Appellant's bundle). In  particular,  I  find
    that the flyers and the business cards were in fact obtained  prior  to
    11 July 2014 and were submitted with the application.  Aside  from  the
    Appellant's own evidence, this is corroborated by the invoice dated  10
    June 2014, which I also find was submitted with the application.

23. It is more likely than not, and applying a bit of  commonsense  to  the
    scenario, that the Appellant in fact distributed  these  marketing  and
    advertising materials locally. In short, they were  published  locally.
    There would have been very little point  in  him  having  gone  to  the
    trouble of producing them, only to have kept them in a box, as it were.
      This  would  have  had  the  obvious  effect  of  defeating  his  own
    application, and in light of  the  detailed  covering  letter  and  the
    fastidious manner in which  the  application  was  prepared  I  am  not
    willing to impute such inaction onto the Appellant.

24. It was accepted by Mr Bramble that if these  particular  items  had  in
    fact been published locally that they would satisfy the requirements of
    the Rules. I find that this is indeed the case.

25. In addition, I find that the website was in existence prior to 11  July
    2014 and that the printouts from that website were  in  fact  submitted
    together with the application (see item 9 on page 195 and pages 252-257
    of the Appellant's bundle). Therefore these printouts also satisfy  the
    requirements of the relevant subparagraph of paragraph 41-SD(e)(iii)(1)
    of Appendix A.

26. For these reasons the  appeal  is  allowed  under  the  Rules,  as  the
    Appellant has in fact satisfied  the  particular  requirements  of  the
    provision in question and no other  provisions  of  the  Rules  are  in
    dispute.

Notice of Decision

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.

I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

I re-make the decision by allowing the appeal under the Immigration Rules.

No anonymity direction is made.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a fee award and have decided to make a reduced  fee
award of �100.00. I have found  that  the  Appellant  did  in  fact  provide
relevant evidence with his application to  the  Respondent.  The  Respondent
did not furnish the First-tier Tribunal  with  all  of  that  evidence.  The
Appellant has succeeded in his  appeal  on  the  basis  upon  which  he  had
originally sought an extension  of  leave  from  the  Respondent.  The  only
reason for reducing the  fee  award  is  that  aspects  of  the  Appellant's
evidence on appeal has not been entirely clear, and thus  required  judicial
adjudication.
