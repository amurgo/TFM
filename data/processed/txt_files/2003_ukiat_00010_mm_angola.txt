                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS



     1. The Secretary of State appeals with leave against the determination
        of an Adjudicator (Mr D A W  Chandler)  allowing  the  respondent's
        appeal against his decision to set  removal  directions  to  Angola
        after refusal of asylum. The respondent is a citizen of Angola.

     2. At the hearing, Mr S Stevenson,  Home  Office  Presenting  Officer,
        appeared for the appellant.  Mr J Gulvin of Counsel represented the
        respondent.

     3. The Adjudicator allowed the respondent's appeal on both asylum  and
        human rights grounds. The appellant  was  not  represented  at  the
        hearing due to operational difficulties.

     4. Leave to appeal was granted, as the Tribunal considered that  there
        was an arguable issue as to whether the respondent would now be  at
        risk of persecution in Angola in the light of the current situation
        evidenced by the CIPU Report for April  2002  and  the  appellant's
        Operational Guidance Note.

     5.  For  the  appellant,  Mr  Gulvin  said  that   he   accepted   the
        Adjudicator's finding of past persecution but that his future  risk
        assessment was  not  sustainable,  as  he  had  ignored  the  peace
        process.

     6. For the respondent, Mr Stevenson said that the CIPU Report had  not
        been served on the respondent's Counsel for the Adjudicator hearing
        (he had represented the respondent before  the  Adjudicator  also).
        The appellant was not entitled to succeed on that  basis.   He  had
        now looked at the October 2002 CIPU Report and  submitted  that  it
        would be right to remit the appeal for rehearing.

     7. He accepted that the  present  objective  evidence  suggested  that
        there would be no great risk to the respondent if she  were  to  be
        returned to Angola now, but the Adjudicator had the  right  not  to
        reject her appeal where  no  Home  Office  Presenting  Officer  was
        available for the Adjudicator hearing.  He asked  the  Tribunal  to
        remit the appeal to be considered under the  CIPU  Report  due  for
        April 2003.

     8. In reply, Mr Gulvin said that it was not the Secretary of State who
        sought to isolate the April 2002 CIPU Report.  At paragraph  17  of
        the determination, the Adjudicator summarised the  then  situation,
        and that was plainly drawn from the April  2002  CIPU  Report.   He
        should have had regard to the totality of that report,  not  merely
        to its  historical  element.   Paragraph  3  of  the  determination
        included a reference to  the  Secretary  of  State's  supplementary
        bundle,  which  contained  the  CIPU  Report  and  the  Adjudicator
        therefore did have it.  We checked the file;  it is there.

     9. The Tribunal reserved its determination for postal delivery,  which
        we now give.  It is  not  open  to  the  Adjudicator  to  disregard
        evidence of the peace process, which is  clearly  set  out  in  the
        April 2002 CIPU Report.  Nor can  the  respondent's  representative
        argue that as he was not personally served with the document (which
        is in the public domain) and did not trouble to look at  it  before
        the hearing, that excuses the Adjudicator's omission.  It does not.
         The respondent's Counsel concedes that the  October  2002  report,
        which he has now  considered,  shows  'no  great  risk'  to  family
        members of UNITA supporters.  The Tribunal would  go  further  than
        that;  the risk is  now  below  the  Article  3  ECHR  and  Refugee
        Convention standard.

    10. It has long been established that risk on return for  the  purposes
        of the Geneva Convention relating to the Status  of  Refugees  1951
        and its protocols or the European Convention on  Human  Rights  and
        Fundamental Freedoms  1950  must  be  considered  at  the  date  of
        hearing.   Accordingly,  the  Adjudicator's  error  in  failing  to
        consider the current position as set out in the April  2002  report
        makes his determination plainly wrong and unsustainable.

    11. The Secretary of State's appeal is allowed.
