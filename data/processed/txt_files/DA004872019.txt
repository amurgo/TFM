                      ERROR OF LAW FINDING AND REASONS


    1. The Secretary of State appeals with permission a decision  of  First-
       tier Tribunal Judge Buckwell  ('the  Judge')  promulgated  on  the  5
       February 2020 in which he allowed Mr [I]'s appeal against  the  order
       for his deportation from  the  United  Kingdom  to  the  Netherlands,
       pursuant to the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2016.

Background

    2. Mr [I] is a citizen of the Netherlands of Somali origin who was  made
       the subject of an order for his deportation from the  United  Kingdom
       following his conviction on the 10 May 2019 at  the  Leicester  Crown
       Court for offences of false  representation  and  for  concealing  or
       disguising criminal  property.  Mr  [I]  was  also  in  breach  of  a
       suspended sentence imposed by the Woolwich Crown  Court  for  similar
       offences on 3 November 2017.
    3. Mr [I] was born on the 16 July 1996  and  entered  the  UK  with  his
       parents in 2003 and has remained since.
    4. The Judge sets out his findings from [80] of the  decision.  The  key
       findings being:

        a. Mr [I] is entitled to the highest level of protection,  that  of
           imperative grounds [82].


        b. Mr [I] is not a persistent offender [84].


        c. Mr [I] is motivated to rehabilitate and not  to  commit  further
           offences [86].


        d. The burden is upon the Secretary  of  State  to  establish  that
           imperative grounds require Mr [I] deportation  and  that  it  is
           proportionate to do so [88].


        e. That the Judge did not hear any detailed reasons  on  behalf  of
           the respondent that persuaded him that the imperative grounds in
           relation to national security had been met [89].


        f. In light of the decision under the Regulations did  not  propose
           in detail to deal with article 8 ECHR but if you were to  do  so
           you would find the respondent's decision disproportionate [90].

    5. The Secretary of State sought permission to appeal asserting

           1. The FTTJ finds that imperative grounds apply in this case but
                fails to properly engage with why the  appellant's  offences
                do not meet that threshold and/or  whether  the  appellant's
                integrative links have  been  broken  as  a  result  of  his
                offending and time spent in prison.


           2. At paragraph 84, the FTTJ finds that the appellant is  not  a
                persistent  offender  that  relies  on  the  fact  that  the
                appellant has the protection of imperative  grounds,  rather
                than undertaking any analysis of why the offending does  not
                meet that threshold. Further,  at  paragraph  89,  the  FTTJ
                refers to "national security" rather  than  public  security
                and again there is no analysis  as  to  why  this  threshold
                cannot be met. See FTTJ should have considered the four year
                sentence that the appellant received  alongside  the  actual
                offences   concerning   the   fraud   and    making    false
                representations  which  clearly  affect   public   security.
                Nowhere has the FTTJ taken into the fact that  although  the
                appellant was first convicted in November 2017, receiving  a
                suspended sentence, he went on to reoffend and was convicted
                in May 2019, when his previous  sentence  was  activated  in
                part as well has been sentenced to a further 3 years.


           3. Given the absence of such analysis of the  circumstances,  it
                cannot be said that the FTTJ has properly considered whether
                or not the appellants offending has met the high  threshold.
                It must be noted that the appellant is still in  prison  and
                therefore out of the community and the FTTJ  has  failed  to
                make any findings on  whether  the  appellant's  integrative
                links have been broken as a  result  of  his  offending  and
                imprisonment.


           4. Further, at paragraph 91, the FTTJ finds that  the  appellant
                is not a genuine, present and  sufficiently  serious  threat
                that the FTTJ clearly states that he is looking  forward  to
                the appellants scheduled release from custody in two  months
                time. The FTTJ could have made this finding as at  the  date
                of hearing and not looking to the future because as  present
                he is still incarcerated and therefore  still  considered  a
                threat to the public. Further, there has  been  no  analysis
                regarding whether or not the appellant is rehabilitated,  or
                focus seems to be on the fact that his parents and  siblings
                would be able to prevent  the  appellant  from  reoffending,
                notwithstanding  the  fact  that  they  were  not  able   to
                influence him previously. Again, there should have been  the
                consideration of the fact that the appellant was  previously
                sentenced a suspended sentence, reoffended and sentence  was
                activated in part  because  he  clearly  remained  a  threat
                public.


           5. Overall, has been inadequate engagement with the  issues  and
                the  evidence  is  such  that  the   findings   are   wholly
                inadequate.

    6. Permission to appeal was granted by another judge of  the  First-tier
       Tribunal who found all grounds to be arguable.

Error of law

    7. In relation to the Judge's finding the appellant was entitled to  the
       higher level of protection, it is settled law  that  the  'ten  years
       residence' is calculated counting backward from date of  decision  to
       deport, and it must be continuous: SSHD v MG [2014] EUECJ C-400/12, B
       v Land Baden W�rttemberg (Case C-316/16) [2019] QB 126. The Judge was
       aware of the chronology including the date of the decision to deport,
       the 1 August 2019, at which point  the  appellant  had  been  in  the
       United Kingdom continuously for a period of 16 years.
    8. It is accepted that even if 10 years has passed, whether a person  is
       entitled to the higher level of protection requires an assessment  of
       whether during the relevant period they  have  maintained  sufficient
       integrative links to the United Kingdom and that periods  in  prison,
       in principle, may weaken such integrative links. What is required  is
       a holistic assessment: Onuekwere (Judgment of the Court) [2014] EUECJ
       C-378/12 (16 January 2014); [2014] 1 WLR 242.
    9. The Judge had available to him written and oral evidence setting  out
       the appellant's case.  The  appellant  was  educated  in  the  United
       Kingdom studying for O and A-levels at school and having studied  for
       a BTEC qualification in business. The Judge records  the  appellant's
       evidence that he wishes to go to university to study business. It was
       noted the appellant has both  parents  and  brothers  in  the  United
       Kingdom who had  visited  him  in  prison.  The  family  support  the
       appellant financially in the  United  Kingdom.  The  appellant  lives
       within the family home. The evidence before the Judge  was  that  the
       appellant could return to the  family  home  upon  his  release  from
       prison or detention. The appellant entered the United Kingdom when he
       was six years of age.
   10. The respondent submitted before the Judge that the appellant's  links
       have been broken because he had been persistent in his offending.  In
       relation to this matter the Judge writes at [84]:

           "84.   Ms Darkwah, understandably, sought to emphasise that  the
                Appellant had been persistent  in  his  offending.  In  that
                respect the Appellant has had  two  substantive  appearances
                before two Crown Courts. Not only, from  the  sentencing  in
                Leicester in May 2019, did the Appellant receive a  term  of
                imprisonment amounting to three years,  but  additionally  a
                period of a previously suspended prison sentence, 12 months,
                was added on a consecutive basis. That is a total four  year
                period. In light  of  those  convictions  and  sentences  Ms
                Darkwah sought to persuade the Tribunal that  the  Appellant
                should be considered to be  a  persistent  offender.  It  is
                certainly true that in the two Crown Court  appearances  the
                Appellant  was   sentenced   for   13   offences.   However,
                considering all the evidence in the round I do not find that
                Appellant should be seen as a  persistent  offender,  having
                been subject to sentencing on two occasions.  The  Appellant
                also had the benefit of the  imperative  grounds  of  public
                security threshold. Specifically that consideration does not
                include public policy."

   11. Contrary to the assertion in the grounds seeking permission to appeal
       to Judge does not find the appellant is  not  a  persistent  offender
       because he is  entitled  to  the  higher  level  of  protection.  The
       specifically finding is that the appellant should not be  seen  as  a
       persistent offender in light of the fact he has only  been  sentenced
       on two occasions, albeit for 13 offences.
   12. A "Persistent Offender" is defined as a person who "keeps on breaking
       the law": Chege ("is a persistent offender") Kenya  [2016]  UKUT  187
       (IAC) (12 April 2016) as approved in SC  (Zimbabwe)  v  Secretary  of
       State for the Home Department [2018] EWCA Civ 929 (26 April 2018) and
       Binbuga v SSHD [2019] EWCA Civ 551. It is a question of fact in  each
       case. The Judge  considered  the  appellant's  criminal  history  but
       clearly found that  the  two  periods  of  offending  for  which  the
       appellant had been sentence did not satisfy this  definition.  Whilst
       the respondent may disagree it has not been shown the Judges  finding
       on this point is outside the range of those reasonably  available  to
       him on the evidence.
   13. As it was found the appellant is not a persistent offender  and  that
       the evidence had not established a breakdown  in  his  links  to  the
       United  Kingdom,  and  that  he  satisfied  the  10  year  continuous
       residence criteria, the finding the appellant  was  entitled  to  the
       higher level of protection has not been shown to be a finding outside
       the range of those available to the Judge on the evidence.
   14. The relevant date at which the Judge was  required  to  assess  these
       matters is the date of the appeal. The burden of proof rested on  the
       Secretary  of  State  to  make  out  her  case  that  the  appellants
       deportation from the United Kingdom is lawful and  justified  on  the
       balance of probabilities: Arranz (EEA  Regulations  -  deportation  -
       test) [2017] UKUT 00294  (IAC).  The  Judge's  finding  is  that  the
       respondent had not discharged the necessary burden. At [89] the Judge
       writes

           "89.   No doubt the conviction of the  Appellant  for  being  in
                possession  of  items  for  use  in  committing   fraudulent
                offences were directly related to the other matters to which
                the Appellant pleaded guilty. I did not  hear  any  detailed
                reasons on behalf of the Respondent which persuaded me  that
                the threshold in relation to imperative grounds of  national
                security had been met. Whilst it might well  have  been  the
                position that my overall findings would have been  different
                if the Appellant did not have the entitlement to the highest
                degree of protection under the EEA  Regulations,  it  is  on
                that basis that I must make my decision."

   15. Whilst the Judge does refer to 'national security' the correct  phase
       of 'public security' is recorded at [84], [88] and  [91],  indicating
       the Judge was fully aware of and applied the correct test. I find the
       reference to 'national security' to be no more than a typing error.
   16. In Tsakouridis (European citizenship) [2010] EUECJ  C-145/09  it  was
       found that 'public security' is concerned  with  state  internal  and
       external  security,  including  threats   to   institutions,   public
       services, military interest and the population. In that case  it  was
       accepted  that  in  some  circumstances  the  definition  encompasses
       instances of serious criminality such as organised crime/trafficking.
   17. It is not made out that the offences  for  which  the  appellant  was
       convicted satisfy this definition. In relation  to  the  future,  the
       Judge was correct to focus on the propensity of the appellant to  re-
       offend. It was not  made  out  before  the  Judge  that  this  is  an
       exceptionally serious case in which the  question  of  deterrence  or
       public revulsion could play a part. The author of the grounds  claims
       the Judge erred by looking at  the  position  if  the  appellant  was
       released from prison. Although the author of  the  ground  seemed  to
       infer that the appellant was imprisoned as a result of the danger  he
       presented to society he was imprisoned because he had been  convicted
       of an offence which a judge of the Crown Court  correctly  found  was
       punishable by a substantial  period  of  imprisonment.  It  does  not
       appear in the evidence there is a finding of 'dangerousness'  by  the
       Criminal court and nor is it made out that the appellant did  pose  a
       risk in the future of reoffending when he was in the confines of  the
       prison system.
   18. In relation to the question of rehabilitation, at [85 - 86] the Judge
       writes:

           "85.   The Appellant's parents gave evidence. I have  summarised
                that above. The father of  the  Appellant  was  particularly
                impressive. He is an extremely  hard  working  man.  He  has
                brought up his family  in  this  country  after  spending  a
                number of years in Holland. Although the  background  detail
                was not provided, nor was it necessary, I  assume  that  the
                Appellant's parents migrated from Somalia as  a  consequence
                of the civil war. I  have  no  doubt  whatsoever  that  both
                parents of the Appellant, and the Appellant's brothers,  are
                indeed ashamed  by  the  behaviour  of  the  Appellant,  and
                rightly so. His family have behaved entirely properly  since
                coming to the United Kingdom and the Appellant's parents are
                both dedicated and respectful individuals who contributed to
                British society by the usual payment of tax and other dues.


           86     I believe and find that both the Appellant's parents  and
                his adult brothers are now fully aware of the need  for  the
                Appellants to abide by the laws of this country and  not  to
                commit further offences. My assessment in the round is  that
                whilst they  were  not  previously  able  to  influence  the
                Appellant appropriately, they will be able to do so now.  In
                the past  the  Appellant  has  been  able  to  disguise  his
                criminal activities to the extent that his parents have  not
                been aware of them, at least in any significant detail. That
                option will simply not subsist  for  the  Appellant  in  the
                future. He has brought shame to his family that he  has  the
                opportunity  to  make  amends.  His  parents  have  set   an
                excellent example and I believe that as a consequence of the
                possibility of deportation to the Netherlands  both  parents
                will put significant effort into ensuring that the Appellant
                does not offend again. Of course there will  be  support  in
                terms of probation when  the  Appellant  has  concluded  his
                sentence. I am satisfied that the Appellant is motivated  to
                rehabilitate and not to commit further offences."

   19. The finding by the Judge that the  appellant  had  rehabilitated  and
       that with family support was not likely to commit further offences is
       a finding within the range of those available to  the  Judge  on  the
       evidence. On that evidence no genuine threat had been established.
   20. The "imperative grounds of public security" presupposes not only  the
       existence of a threat to public security, but also that such a threat
       is  of  a  particularly  high  degree  of  seriousness:   Tsakouridis
       (European citizenship) [2010] EUECJ C-145/09, I v Oberb�rgermeisterin
       der Stadt Remscheid (Case C-348/09) [2012]  Q.B.  799.  See  also  FV
       (Italy) v SSHD [2013] 1 W.L.R. 3339 relied upon by Ms Tobin  for  its
       application.
   21. The difficulty for the Secretary of  State  is  that  an  experienced
       judge clearly considered the  relevant  matters  applicable  to  this
       appeal and, even if not setting out the decision in  the  manner  the
       author of the grounds would have preferred,  makes  a  clear  finding
       supported by adequate reasons that the respondent had not established
       that the applicable threshold  had  been  crossed.  The  finding  the
       appellants deportation will be contrary to the  Regulations,  on  the
       facts, has not been shown to be a finding outside the range of  those
       reasonably available to the Judge on the evidence.
   22. Whilst  the  Judge  is  criticised  in  relation  to  the  article  8
       assessment, the Judge allowed the appeal under  the  Regulations  and
       was therefore not required to do more. The Judge did not carry out  a
       full article 8 assessment as a result indicating that if he had to do
       so the likely outcome would  have  been  a  finding  the  deportation
       decision was not proportionate. That is an indication and no more and
       one in the alternative which forms no  part  of  the  Judges  primary
       findings.
   23. If the appellant reoffends the proposed changes to the applicable law
       following the United Kingdom leaving the European Union may  mean  he
       may not have the benefit of such protection in the future.

Decision

   24. There is  no  material  error  of  law  in  the  Immigration  Judge's
       decision. The determination shall stand.

  Anonymity.

   25. The First-tier Tribunal did  not  make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
       45(4)(i) of the Asylum and  Immigration  Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
       2005.

       I make no such order pursuant to rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
       (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.
