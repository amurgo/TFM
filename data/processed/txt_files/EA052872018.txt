 DECISION PURSUANT TO RULE 40(3) OF THE TRIBUNAL PROCEDURE (UPPER TRIBUNAL)
                                 RULES 2008

 1. The appellant appealed to the First-tier  Tribunal  ("FtT")  against  a
    decision dated 18 July 2018 to refuse a permanent residence card as the
    family member of an EEA national. The  FtT  dismissed  the  appellant's
    appeal.

 2. At the hearing before us on 21 August 2019 it was  agreed  between  the
    parties that the FtT erred in law for the reasons advanced  in  grounds
    of appeal in relation to the decision of the FtT.

 3. It was also agreed between the parties that the errors of law are  such
    as to require the decision of the FtT to be  set  aside,  and  for  the
    decision to be re-made, allowing the appeal.

 4. In the circumstances, we set aside the decision of the FtT for error of
    law and re-make the decision, allowing the appeal under the Immigration
    (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016.

 5. Pursuant to rule 40(3)(a) of the Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)
    Rules 2008, no reasons (or further reasons) are required, the  decision
    being made with the consent of the parties.
