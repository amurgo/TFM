                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT


                                                                  Respondent

For the Appellant:     Mr S Winter, Advocate, instructed by Gillespie
MacAndrew LLP
For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is from Hong Kong.   His  parents  live  there.   He  was
    educated at boarding school in England  from  age  12  or  13.   During
    shorter holiday periods, he went to stay with his  aunt  and  uncle  in
    Edinburgh.  He spent the longer holidays with his parents in Hong Kong.
     He stayed with his aunt and uncle while he attended Napier University.
     He applied on 24 September 2015 for indefinite leave to remain in  the
    UK, based on long residency (10 years).

 2. The respondent refused his application for  reasons  explained  in  her
    decision dated 17 January 2016.

 3. In grounds of appeal to the FtT, the appellant  accepted  that  he  had
    been absent from the UK for 703 days in the 10-year  period,  exceeding
    the permitted maximum by 163 days.  He said that the respondent  failed
    to consider the duration of and reasons for absence, and the compelling
    and compassionate circumstances; it was unreasonable and  unlawful  not
    to exercise discretion in his favour; and he  had  a  right  to  remain
    under article 8, notwithstanding non-compliance with the  rules,  based
    on his private and family life.

 4. FtT Judge Doyle dismissed the appellant's appeal, giving his reasons in
    a decision promulgated on 13 December 2016.

 5. These are the grounds of appeal to the UT, lightly edited:

      Ground 1 - errors of law in relation to family life.

      The tribunal erred in law  in  finding  that  the  appellant  had  not
      established family life with his uncle and aunt.

      (i) Error at �15 (c).  There is  no  need  for  the  appellant  to  be
      dependent on his aunt and uncle for family life to  be  established  -
      Gurung [2013] 1 WLR 2546, �44-46.

      (ii) Further error at �15 (c).   The  tribunal  failed  to  place  the
      appellant's relationship in context and thus failed  exercise  anxious
      scrutiny.  Even if not dependent on  them  "just  now",  he  had  been
      dependent on them since he was 12 years of age, was still living  with
      them and accordingly family life was established.

      (iii) Error at 15 (d), finding nothing beyond  normal  emotional  ties
      between the appellant and his aunt and uncle.  There is no such  test.
       Whether family  life  exists  is  simply  a  matter  of  fact.    The
      relationship does not need to be beyond normal emotional ties.

      (iv)  It is unclear whether the tribunal had in mind the correct test.
       Where the tribunal had in mind the wrong considerations and had those
      at the forefront of its mind, it cannot be  said  the  decision  would
      have been the same.

      Ground 2 - errors of  law  assessing  the  appeal  with  reference  to
      article 8.

      (i) Failure to assess whether the decision was in accordance with  the
      law, in relation to policy and to discretion whether  to  grant  leave
      under �276B of the immigration rules

      (ii) Error at �16, applying an  exceptionality  test;  a  term  to  be
      avoided as it creates confusion - Hesham  Ali  [2016]  UKSC  60.   The
      tribunal "failed to recognise that  the  question  is  simply  whether
      factors  in  favour  of  the  appellant  are  sufficient  to  outweigh
      immigration control. In particular, the tribunal  has  not  given  any
      weight or not explained what weight it has given to the fact that  the
      appellant has been lawfully in the UK for the time he has been in  the
      UK."

      (iii) Error at �16 in looking for "compelling circumstances"; there is
      no need for "compelling circumstances"; the correct  test  is  one  of
      proportionality - Hesham Ali.

      (iv) Error in finding "no reason" to consider  the  case  outside  the
      rules; it is evident  that  the  tribunal  should  consider  the  case
      outside the rules - Khan [2016] CSIH 13.

 6. In a skeleton argument, the appellant amplifies the grounds.

      Ground 1 - reliance also on Ghising [2012] UKUT 00160.  Error material
      as tribunal failed to assess proportionality on basis  that  there  is
      family life.

      Ground 2 - exceptionality the wrong  approach,  supported  by  Agyarko
      [2017] 1 WLR 283 at �57 and by Rhuppiah [2016] 1 WLR 4203 at �53.

      If  appellant's  stay  was  lawful  and  not  precarious,  exceptional
      circumstances not the correct test - Rhuppiah at �44.

 7. Mr Winter submitted further on ground 1 that although  the  Judge  said
    that the existence of family life was a  question  of  fact,  he  over-
    relied on Kugathas, which is outdated, and that it could  not  be  said
    that on a different finding, the outcome would have been the same;  and
    on ground 2, that the judge had not considered whether the decision was
    in accordance with the law, or  applied  the  correct  test  for  cases
    outside the rules.

 8. Mr Matthews replied to the "according to the law" argument by  pointing
    out that the appeal is on human rights grounds only,  which  rank  over
    policy and discretion.  Policy might inform an outcome, but  could  not
    have the effect that an appeal succeeded where a human right  to  leave
    to remain was not shown.  He submitted  further  as  follows.   Agyarko
    confirmed that there had to be something significant and compelling  to
    justify a right  outside  the  rules.   The  appellant  had  been  here
    lawfully, but only as a student, not on a route to settlement, and  his
    status had always been precarious as interpreted in the case law.   The
    judge had not applied an erroneous test of legal exceptionality.   Even
    if some error of legal approach were found, the outcome of the case, on
    the evidence, should be the same.

 9. I reserved my decision.

10. Agyarko deals with "exceptional circumstances" at �54 - 60.  At �57 the
    Court says that ultimately a tribunal:

      ... has  to  decide  whether  the  refusal  is  proportionate  in  the
      particular case before  it,  balancing  the  strength  of  the  public
      interest in the removal of the person in question against  the  impact
      on private and family life. In doing so, it  should  give  appropriate
      weight to the Secretary of State's policy, expressed in the Rules  and
      the Instructions, that the public interest in immigration control  can
      be outweighed, when considering an application  for  leave  to  remain
      brought by a person in the UK in  breach  of  immigration  laws,  only
      where   there   are   "insurmountable   obstacles"   or   "exceptional
      circumstances" as defined. It must also consider all factors  relevant
      to the specific case  in  question,  including,  where  relevant,  the
      matters discussed in  paras  51-52  above.  The  critical  issue  will
      generally be whether, giving due weight to the strength of the  public
      interest in the removal of the person  in  the  case  before  it,  the
      article 8 claim is sufficiently strong to outweigh it. In general,  in
      cases  concerned  with  precarious  family  life,  a  very  strong  or
      compelling claim is  required  to  outweigh  the  public  interest  in
      immigration control.

11. The test for a case to succeed outside the  rules  has  been  variously
    described, but has not changed, and remains a high  one.   The  grounds
    erroneously sought to minimise it.

12. The case law may be moving towards the view that there are  degrees  of
    precarious status; but it is plain that the appellant's stay has always
    been as a school and university student, not on a settlement route, and
    has been precarious.

13. Beyond that, the grounds and submissions for the appellant seek to over-
    analyse the judge's phrasing of his decision, and  to  search  minutely
    for error of legal approach where there is none.  The  case  turned  on
    the assessment of the facts, not on  any  legal  nuance.   As  to  that
    assessment, the grounds are only disagreement.

14. The appellant has some family life in  the  UK,  in  the  extended  and
    everyday sense of the phrase, but not  within  the  protected  core  of
    article 8.  The judge's finding on that issue was plainly open to  him,
    and was not affected by any legal error.

15. If there had been such error, then on the evidence, I would have had no
    difficulty in coming to the same conclusion.

16. The applicant is  no  doubt  a  blameless  individual  with  a  genuine
    preference to make the UK rather than Hong Kong the centre of his life.
     However, the tribunal was plainly entitled  to  find  nothing  in  his
    private and family life which gives him a right to do so, other than by
    bringing himself within  the  terms  of  the  immigration  rules.   The
    outcome on proportionality was the only one ever likely  to  have  been
    reached.

17. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.

18. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
