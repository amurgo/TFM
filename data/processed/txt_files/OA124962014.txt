Representation

For the Appellant:     Ms N Wilcocks-Briscoe, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr P Turner, counsel, instructed by Greater London
Solicitors

                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. I shall refer to the appellant as "the entry clearance officer" and to
      the respondent as "the claimant."


   2. The entry  clearance  officer  appeals  with  permission  against  the
      decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge promulgated on 25  September
      2015, allowing the claimant's appeal against the decision of the entry
      clearance officer dated 21 August 2014 refusing  his  application  for
      leave to  enter  the  UK  as  a  partner  under  Appendix  FM  of  the
      Immigration Rules.


     The entry clearance officer's case


   3. In refusing the  claimant's  application  for  entry  clearance  as  a
      partner under Appendix FM of the Rules, the  entry  clearance  officer
      asserted in respect of the financial requirements that had to be  met,
      that his sponsor provided evidence showing that she is employed  as  a
      teaching assistant and meal supervisor at a  school  earning  a  total
      salary of �15,842.15 a year which is lower  than  the  minimum  income
      threshold required, namely �18,600 per year.


   4. With regard to the assertion that the sponsor  is  also  self-employed
      and has submitted a letter from her accountant dated 2  October  2013,
      stating that she earned �6,324 in September 2013 and �14,124 in  March
      2014, the dates on this letter did not correspond  as  the  letter  is
      dated October 2013 while it is dealing  with  the  sponsor's  accounts
      from March 2014.


   5.  Additionally,  it  is  asserted  that  various  specified   documents
      demonstrating self-employment, as set out in  Appendix  FM-SE  of  the
      Immigration  Rules,  had  not  been  provided.  The  application   was
      accordingly refused under paragraph EC-P.1.1 (d) of Appendix FM of the
      rules.


   6. On  19  February  2015,  the  Entry  Clearance  Manager  reviewed  the
      decision. It is noted at paragraph 2 that following the refusal of the
      application, the refusal notice advised the  claimant  to  submit  any
      additional evidence they may have in order that concerns mentioned  in
      the notice could be properly addressed. The ECM identified ten of  the
      documents which had been submitted with the application.


   7. The ECM also set out  documents  "submitted  with  the  appeal".  That
      included bank statements; CT600, evidence of registration  with  HMRC;
      accounts and invoices.


   8. The ECM referred at paragraph 3 of the Review, to the  fact  that  the
      application had been refused as the claimant had not provided evidence
      of the sponsor's income from self-employment. As  the  business  is  a
      limited company, the claimant is required to provide documents  listed
      at paragraph 9 of  Appendix  FM-SE.  The  documents  provided  by  the
      claimant did not meet the requirements as:


        i. The CT 600 tax return has been provided but there is no evidence
           that it has been submitted to HMRC;


       ii. A certificate of incorporation has been  provided  stating  that
           the company was incorporated in  March  2013.  No  evidence  was
           provided showing the sponsor was operating her  business  before
           then. As the application was  submitted  in  January  2014,  the
           business was  operating  for  less  than  one  year  before  the
           application was submitted. The claimant  could  accordingly  not
           show that his sponsor had  earned  the  required  annual  amount
           prior to the application;


      iii. The appointments report, P60, payslips and documents relating to
           dividends or anything set out at paragraph 9(b)(vii) of Appendix
           FM-SE had not been submitted.


       iv. As the claimant is relying on a  combination  of  the  sponsor's
           income from salaried  employment  and  self  employment,  he  is
           required to show that she earned the required  amount  over  the
           same period. This  had  not  been  done  as  documents  produced
           related to the sponsor's salaried employment going back  as  far
           as April 2013 whereas the application was made in January 2014.


   9. The First-tier Tribunal Judge stated at [3] that  in  considering  the
      appeal,  he  bore  in  mind  the  legal  provisions  of  the  relevant
      paragraphs of the Immigration Rules as amended.  He  has  borne  every
      provision  of  these  paragraphs  in  mind  meticulously  during   the
      assessment of the claimant's case.


  10. There was no presenting officer in  attendance  at  the  hearing.  The
      sponsor attended the hearing and adopted her witness  statement  dated
      10 September 2015. There was also a statement from the  claimant.  The
      Judge stated that he read the statements of the claimant and his  wife
      and other documents in the bundle. He also took into account the  oral
      evidence.


  11. He found that the sponsor gave evidence consistent with the assertions
      made by the claimant in his application. She also told the Judge  that
      she was of the opinion that the refusal  was  totally  incorrect.  The
      Judge noted that the sponsor asserted that there was clear documentary
      evidence showing that she was earning over �19,000 per annum [7].


  12. The Judge stated at [8] that he has outlined the  evidential  elements
      of the evidence adduced on behalf of the claimant. He has  taken  into
      account the documentary and oral evidence in making  up  his  mind  on
      factual issues.


  13. He concluded at [10a] that it was  helpful  that  the  sponsor's  oral
      evidence corroborated her evidence in her statement.  The  only  issue
      raised was whether the sponsor had the income of �18,600  required  by
      the new Rules. He found that, "as was elicited by admissible evidence"
      the entry clearance  officer  had  failed  to  look  at  the  evidence
      neutralising that point - indubitably, I was left in no doubt that the
      ECO concerned had failed to look at the evidence at his/her  disposal"
      [10b].


  14. The Judge took into account the reasons set out in the refusal  notice
      of 21 August 2014 [11]. He noted that it had been submitter before him
      that  the  ECO  had  made  a  mistake  about  the  income;   all   the
      requirements under the Immigration Rules were met [12].


  15. He further stated that the "rule of law" demands that a person  should
      be able to benefit from the ECHR so long as the UK remains a party  to
      that Convention [15]. He stated at [17] that he is pleased  to  assist
      this claimant to have some family life and allow this  appeal.  He  is
      fully conscious of the "legal requirements" stipulated by  immigration
      law. It was incumbent upon him to  advert  to  the  new  rules  giving
      respect to the animus legis dictated by the supremacy  of  Parliament.
      The rule of law demands that this claimant should  be  helped  by  the
      system because respect has to be shown by the obligations  imposed  on
      the Court of this country by the ECHR [18].


  16. He went on to find that "the appeal, of course, can be  allowed  under
      the Immigration Rules because the ECO had manifestly failed to look at
      the relevant evidence." Alternatively, the appeal can be allowed under
      ECHR [18].


  17. He  stated  that  in  view  of  his  deliberations  in  the  preceding
      paragraphs, he is persuaded that the claimant comes within law and can
      benefit from the relevant Immigration Rules, as amended [19].


  18. On 11 March 2016, First-tier Tribunal Judge Chohan granted  the  entry
      clearance officer permission to appeal. The grounds contended that the
      Judge failed  to  make  any  findings  of  fact  in  relation  to  the
      Immigration Rules and Article 8.  Judge  Chohan  stated  that  he  had
      carefully considered the Judge's decision and "....I have to say  that
      it is difficult to understand on what  basis  the  Judge  allowed  the
      appeal under the Immigration Rules and  Article  8  of  the  EHCR.  No
      specific findings have been made on the facts and evidence before  the
      Judge." It was accordingly an arguable error of law.


  19. Ms Wilcocks-Briscoe submitted that no findings had in fact  been  made
      and no reasons had been given. The Judge accordingly did not  set  out
      the basis upon which the claimant met the Rules. The  issues  relating
      to specified evidence was raised both in the reasons for  refusal  and
      the subsequent ECM review.  She referred to the decision of the  Upper
      Tribunal in Shizad (sufficiency of Reasons:  set  aside)  [2013]  UKUT
      00085 (IAC).


  20. The Tribunal held in Shizad  - an appeal  against  a  negative  asylum
      decision - that although there  is  a  legal  duty  to  give  a  brief
      explanation of the conclusions on a central issue on which  an  appeal
      is determined, those reasons need not be extensive if the decision  as
      a whole makes sense, having regard to the  material  accepted  by  the
      Judge.  Although a decision may contain an error  of  law,  where  the
      requirements to give adequate reasons are not met, the Upper  Tribunal
      would not normally set aside a decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
      where there has been no misdirection of law, the fact-finding  process
      cannot be criticised and the relevant country guidance has been  taken
      into account unless the conclusions the Judge draws from  the  primary
      data were not reasonably open to him.


  21. Ms Wilcocks-Briscoe submitted that  there  was  no  reference  to  the
      specified evidence  required.  The  appellant  had  not  provided  the
      documents identified as being required by Appendix FM-SE. The claimant
      could therefore not show that there was the minimum amount of  �18,600
      established. There was no reference to any documents,  let  alone  how
      the documents satisfied the relevant parts of Appendix FM-SE.


  22. Nor was there any analysis, assessment or reasons given as to how  the
      appeal was allowed under the Human Rights Convention.


  23. On behalf of the claimant, Mr Turner submitted that the bundle of some
      250 pages of documents was produced before the Tribunal.


  24. He made reference to the  evidence  of  financial  requirements  under
      Appendix FM set out in Appendix FM-SE. He referred to paragraph A1(9),
      relating to income from employment and/or shares in a limited  company
      based in the UK.


  25. A1(2) set out the evidence to  be  provided  in  respect  of  salaried
      employment in the UK except where paragraph 9 applies.  This  includes
      payslips covering a  period  of  six  months  prior  to  the  date  of
      application if the person has been employed by  the  current  employer
      for at least six months (and where paragraph  13(b)  of  the  appendix
      does not apply).


  26. Paragraph 2(c) also requires personal bank statements corresponding to
      the same period(s) as the payslips at paragraph 2(a) showing that  the
      salary has been paid into an account in the name of the person  or  in
      the name of the person and their partner jointly.


  27. Paragraph A1(7) sets out  the  documents  that  must  be  provided  in
      respect of self employment in the UK, inter alia, as a sole trader.


  28. Mr Turner submitted that documents were in the bundle as noted by  the
      Judge at [7] and [8]. The Judge was therefore alive to the  assertions
      made by  the  entry  clearance  officer  and  manager  as  to  missing
      documents. They had been supplied. Mr Turner accepted that he did  not
      take the Judge through all the documents specified in Appendix FM-SE.


  29. Mr Turner submitted that in the circumstances, it is a bit late in the
      day to unpick what was or was not read by the Judge.  The  Judge  said
      that he had read it and that was the basis of  his  conclusions.  This
      amounted to a finding that the ECO and the ECM were wrong.


  30. In reply, Ms Wilcocks-Briscoe submitted that even if the Judge had had
      regard to these  documents  in  the  bundle,  some  of  the  specified
      evidence was supplied "post decision". She referred by way of  example
      to page 47 containing an income certificate for Jacinth Associates Ltd
      dated 16 September  2014.  The  letter  is  sent  to  "Chief  Clearing
      Officer". It is asserted that they  have  prepared  the  accounts  for
      Jacinth Associates Ltd for the financial year 1 April 2013 to 31 March
      2014 and confirmed the figures from the accounts and balance sheet for
      the said period.


  31. That evidence post-dates the decision. She referred to the application
      for entry clearance at D of the entry clearance officer's  bundle.  At
      D21,  the  section  dealing  with  the  sponsor's  income  from  self-
      employment has been left blank. The application was  submitted  online
      on 12 November 2013.


  32. She submitted that in the circumstances the  decision  should  be  set
      aside and remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for a decision to be re-
      made.


      Assessment


  33. I find that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge was diffused
      and  unfocused.  There  has  been  no  attempt  to  grapple  with  the
      assertions made by the ECO or the ECM relating to the  documents  that
      were required to be provided, including those that had to be  supplied
      as at the date of application.


  34. As noted by Wilcocks-Briscoe the application submitted online  by  the
      claimant on 12 November 2013, did not set out at D21 any of the detail
      required in respect of the sponsor's income from self employment.  Nor
      was there any accompanying letter from  either  the  claimant  or  his
      solicitors.


  35. I have had regard to the claimant's grounds of appeal  to  the  First-
      tier Tribunal against the decisions of the ECO dated 24 March 2014. It
      is asserted that if evidence was missing in line with Appendix  FM-SE,
      the "secretary of state" should have made contact  with  the  claimant
      for this evidence. There was no good reason why the claimant  was  not
      contacted. That was unfair in the circumstances.  The  appeal  against
      the decision dated 24 March 2014 in appeal  number  OA/05760/2015  was
      set down for hearing on 25 March 2015.


  36. Even though there was a pending appeal, the ECO issued a new  decision
      giving a fresh right of appeal. That  was  the  decision  -  dated  21
      August  2014  -  that  was  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal   Judge.
      Accordingly the solicitors stated that "we submit a fresh appeal  with
      the requested documents. Since we have already  submitted  grounds  of
      appeal, we submit the same grounds of appeal and request  the  ECM  to
      rely on the grounds that address issues raised by the  decision  dated
      21 August 2014." Further documents were submitted. Those documents are
      set out in the ECM review.


  37. It was as noted, still asserted that the documents  provided  did  not
      meet the requirements for the purpose of paragraph 9 of  Appendix  FM-
      SE.


  38. The Judge did not however consider the ECO's contentions  relating  to
      such documentation referred to at paragraph 3 of the ECM appeal review
      dated 19 February 2015.  There  had  merely  been  an  assertion  that
      documentary evidence has been  provided.  That  is  what  the  sponsor
      stated during her evidence [7].


  39. The Judge was left in no doubt that the ECO concerned  had  failed  to
      look at the evidence at his/her disposal [10b]. That was not  correct,
      having regard to the detailed report from  the  ECM  as  well  as  the
      evidence before the ECO.


  40. It had merely been submitted that the appeal should be allowed as  the
      ECO made a mistake about the income and that all the requirements  had
      been met.


  41. Mr Turner has been frank in informing me that  he  did  not  take  the
      Judge through the evidence which the claimant and sponsor asserted had
      been  provided  to  demonstrate  that  the  requirements  relating  to
      specified evidence had been met.


  42. It is an essential feature in the making of any decision for  a  party
      to know why they lose or succeed. The decision itself  should  contain
      sufficient and appropriate reasons demonstrating that the  contentious
      issues have been properly assessed and considered.


  43. I find in this case that  the  failure  to  provide  adequate  reasons
      renders the  decision  unsafe.  It  also  appears  that  some  of  the
      documentation relied on, and which needed  to be provided  as  at  the
      date of the application, had only been  produced  after  the  date  of
      decision.


  44. I accordingly find that the making of the decision by  the  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge involved the making of errors on  a  point  of  law.  I
      accordingly set it aside. The parties agreed that  in  that  event  it
      would have to be re-made. There will be substantial fact finding  that
      will be necessary. This is  accordingly  an  appropriate  case  to  be
      remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for the decision to be re-made.


      Notice of Decision


      The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  involved  the  making  of  an
      error of law and the decision is set aside. The claimant's  appeal  is
      remitted to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Taylor  House)  for  a  fresh
      decision to be made by another Judge.


      No anonymity direction is made.
