                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS




     1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against a determination
        of First-tier Tribunal Judge S J Pacey promulgated  on  13th  March
        2014 in which he allowed the above Respondent's appeal, under  both
        the Immigration Rules and on  human  rights  grounds,  against  the
        refusal of an Entry Clearance Officer to grant him leave  to  enter
        the United Kingdom for the purposes of settlement as the spouse  of
        his sponsor.


     2. There are two reasons for the refusal, firstly  that  it  was  said
        there was no evidence provided that the  marriage  was  valid  and,
        secondly, it was said the Respondent cannot satisfy  the  financial
        requirements as his sponsor will need a gross income  of  at  least
        �18,600 a year whereas her  employment  details  only  revealed  an
        annual income of �5,756.29 which could not be made up  by  relevant
        savings.  The letter from the sponsor's  employer  did  not  comply
        with the Rules regarding the specified evidence required.


     3. The Respondent is a citizen of Kosovo born on the 17th August 1975.
         He acknowledged in the grounds of appeal that  his  sponsor  could
        not meet the current financial requirements of the Rules  but  said
        that if the appeal was allowed he will  enter  the  United  Kingdom
        allowing his sponsor to work additional hours for, as her  husband,
        he is able to help with childcare.


     4. The Judge notes that the income revealed by the sponsor  was  "well
        short" of  the  relevant  threshold  contained  in  the  Rules  but
        indicates that that was "not the end of the matter"[10]. The  Judge
        refers to paragraph EX.1  of  Appendix  FM  which  would  allow  an
        applicant  to  succeed  if  they  have  a  genuine  and  subsisting
        relationship with a partner who is in  the  UK  and  is  a  British
        citizen, settled in the UK or in  the  UK  with  refugee  leave  or
        humanitarian protection, and that insurmountable obstacles exist to
        family life with that partner continuing outside the UK exist.


     5. The  Judge  states  that  in  his  mind  there  are  insurmountable
        obstacles in the case and refers to the history  at  paragraph  12,
        following which he concludes that absent any finding in relation to
        insurmountable obstacles it appeared to the Judge that  there  are,
        in any event, exceptional circumstances in this case.


     6. The Judge then states, in paragraph 14, that even if the Respondent
        had not succeeded under the Rules he  would  have  needed  to  have
        considered the case as a stand-alone Article 8 case.  Having  found
        that the parties have a family life recognised  by  Article  8  the
        Judge then refers to the case of MM [2013] EWHC 1900 and finds  the
        situation of the Respondent and his sponsor falls within the  ambit
        of that decision. In the conclusions  at  paragraph  17  the  Judge
        finds "Had I not, then, found for  the  Appellant  under  paragraph
        EX.1 (and/or "exceptional circumstances") I would  have  held  that
        the decision under appeal was one  disproportionate  in  Article  8
        terms."


     7. The Secretary of State sought permission to appeal  asserting  that
        in paragraph 9 of the determination the Judge  finds  that  on  the
        totality of the evidence the Respondent was unable to  comply  with
        the Rules yet thereafter appears to disregard this as a  result  of
        which any subsequent finding relating to the  Rules  is  incorrect.
        The grounds also assert that allowing the appeal  under  Article  8
        ECHR is wrong  as  the  way  in  which  the  Judge  approached  his
        assessment is contrary to settled law.


     8. In relation to the Judge's findings  relating  to  the  High  Court
        decision in MM, the grounds assert that this is only  a  persuasive
        authority and that in relying upon this case in  the  way  that  he
        did, the Judge has materially erred especially in relation  to  the
        proportionality assessment.


     9. The grounds also assert that paragraph 17, where the Judge found he
        would have allowed  the  appeal  under  EX1,  indicates  a  further
        failing in the Judge's thinking as EX.1 is not applicable to  entry
        clearance applications.



Error of law


    10. Before the First-tier Tribunal the  Respondent  was  without  legal
        representation and it appears the Judge did his best to assist  the
        Respondent and his  sponsor  but,  as  stated  in  MG  (Serbia  and
        Montenegro) (2005) UKAIT 00113, sympathy for an individual did  not
        enhance a person's rights under Article 8.


    11. The Judge recognises that the level of  maintenance  available  was
        not sufficient to satisfy the minimum required figure  set  out  in
        the Immigration Rules and also appears to have accepted that, as  a
        result, the requirements of the Rules could not be met. If this  is
        so, the subsequent decision allowing the appeal under the Rules  in
        paragraph 18 of the determination is a material legal error  absent
        other provisions which permit such a decision to be made.


    12. It is a legal error to allow an appeal under paragraph  EX.1  as  a
        freestanding element of the Rules.  This is a challenge to an entry
        clearance decision and there is no mention of EX 1 in the  relevant
        part of the Rules relating to such an application. See  also  Sabir
        (Appendix FM - EX.1 not free standing) [2014] UKUT 63 (IAC).


    13. In relation to the  approach  to  the  Article  8  issues,  it  was
        necessary for the Judge to consider these in  accordance  with  the
        approach set out by the Court of Appeal in MF (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA
        Civ 1192, the High Court in Nagre [2013] EWHC 720  (Admin)  and  by
        the Upper Tribunal in Gulshan [2013]  UKUT  640,  as  confirmed  in
        Shahzad (Art 8: legitimate aim) [2014] UKUT 00085.  These judgments
        are made it clear that the  question  of  proportionality  must  be
        looked at in the context of the immigration rules with no  need  to
        go on to a specific assessment under Article 8 if it is clear  from
        the  fact  is  that  there  are  no  particularly   compelling   or
        exceptional circumstances requiring that course  of  action  to  be
        taken.  Such approach was recently confirmed by the Court of Appeal
        in Haleemundeen v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 558.


    14. It is arguable that the  Judge  therefore  erred  in  treating  the
        matter as a stand-alone Article 8 case and going on to consider  it
        outside the Rules and by reference to MF (Nigeria) [2012] UKUT  393
        as that case had been overturned by the Court  of  Appeal,  without
        more. I also find that in placing reliance upon the decision in  MM
        the Judge failed to sufficiently analyse principles in the case  or
        to  conduct   a   proportionality   assessment   in   which   equal
        consideration was given to the legitimate aim relied  upon  by  the
        Secretary of State.  It is not sufficient to  state  that  had  the
        appeal not been allowed under paragraph EX.1. It  would  have  been
        allowed on the basis it was disproportionate  in  Article  8  terms
        without properly analysing why this should be so, or  even  whether
        there was a need to consider Article 8 outside the Rules.


    15. I find the above Appellant has established a material  legal  error
        in the decision of the Judge. The determination shall be set aside.
        The findings made regarding the nature of the relationship and  the
        Respondent and  his  sponsor's  circumstances  shall  be  preserved
        findings.



Discussion



    16. In proceeding to remake the decision the Upper Tribunal was able to
        hear oral evidence from the sponsor. That evidence related  to  her
        financial circumstances in which she confirmed  that  she  did  not
        earn the required �18,600 per annum due to family  commitments  and
        so Mr Gushlla could not meet the minimum financial requirements  of
        the Rules.


    17. The sponsor has two children who speak Albanian  and  who  recently
        spent five weeks in Kosovo and enjoyed their  visit.   The  sponsor
        has family in Kosovo, her  mother  and  father,  who  the  children
        stayed with whilst she and her husband  were  able  to  spend  time
        together.


    18. The sponsor entered the United Kingdom  in  1999  lawfully  with  a
        spouse visa and her children are from that  marriage.  She  and  Mr
        Gushlla grew up in the same area and met when  they  were  younger.
        Their respective prior relationships and medical issues  were  also
        discussed.


    19. Such discussion reveals that Mr Gushlla's position remains  similar
        to that which existed at the time of the application to  the  Entry
        Clearance Officer, in that  the  requirements  of  the  Immigration
        Rules cannot be met.  There  was  a  need  to  identify  compelling
        circumstances outside the Rules and although this appears to  be  a
        long-standing relationship with family and  issues  discussed  with
        the sponsor, it was submitted by Mr Harrison that a lawful decision
        had been made that the  Tribunal  was  unable  to  go  behind.   In
        relation to Article 8, he submitted this element depended upon  the
        case of MM.


    20. In MM and Others v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department
        [2013] EWHC 1900 (Admin) Blake J held that the Secretary  of  State
        for the Home Department's June 2012 amendments to  the  Immigration
        Rules HC 395 (as amended) concerning the  maintenance  requirements
        for the admission of spouses  to  the  UK,  including  raising  the
        minimum income level to be provided by a UK sponsor to �18,600, had
        a legitimate aim in promoting measures that required spouses to  be
        maintained at a somewhat higher level  than  the  bare  subsistence
        level set under previous interpretations of the Rules. He took  the
        view that when applied to recognised refugees or British  Citizens,
        the  measures  were  so  onerous  as  to  be   a   disproportionate
        interference with family  life,  suggesting  instead  a  figure  of
        �13,400.


    21. The first issue of note is that the category of applicants Blake  J
        thought were adversely affected by the impact of the new rules  was
        limited and did not include all applicants and secondly, of greater
        importance, is that the case has been overturned on appeal.


    22. In MM(Lebanon) and others [2014] EWCA Civ 985 it was said  that  in
        setting  the  maintenance  limits  the  Secretary  of   State   had
        "discharged the burden of demonstrating that the  interference  was
        both the minimum necessary and strikes a fair balance  between  the
        interests of the groups concerned and  the  community  in  general.
        Individuals will have  different  views  on  what  constitutes  the
        minimum income requirements needed to accomplish the stated  policy
        aims. In my judgment it is not the court's job to  impose  its  own
        view unless, objectively  judged,  the  levels  chosen  are  to  be
        characterised as irrational, or  inherently  unjust  or  inherently
        unfair. In my view they cannot be".


    23. The importance of  demonstrating  the  availability  of  sufficient
        funding in the eyes  of  the  United  Kingdom  government  is  also
        demonstrated by the provisions of the Immigration Act 2014 where it
        is stated that it is in the public interest, and in  particular  in
        the interests of the economic well-being  of  the  United  Kingdom,
        that persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom  are
        financially independent, because such persons-(a) are not a  burden
        on taxpayers, and
          (b) are better able to integrate into society.


    24. The case of MM was not a challenge to a decision made by a decision
        maker such as the Entry Clearance Officer but to the lawfulness  of
        the new Immigration Rules themselves, which failed.  In relation to
        the Article 8 "question" the Court stated at para 132:


              "....The only difference, when it  is  an  IR  that  is  being
   challenged in principle, as           opposed to an individual Article  8
   decision, is that the "proportionality"                questions have  to
   be considered in principle. In  that  case,  it  seems  to  me  the  test
   must be whether, assuming the relevant  IR  constitutes  an  interference
   with a              Convention right,  the  IR  and  its  application  to
   particular cases, would be                inherently disproportionate  or
   unfair. Another way of putting the test is whether              the IR is
   incapable of being proportionate and so is inherently unjustified."


    25. In paragraph 134:


               Where  the  relevant  group  of  IRs,   upon   their   proper
   construction, provide a                    "complete  code"  for  dealing
   with   a   person's   Convention   rights   in   the   context    of    a
   particular IR or statutory provision, such as in  the  case  of  "foreign
   criminals",[152]             then the balancing exercise and the way  the
   various factors are to be taken into          account  in  an  individual
   case must be done in accordance with that code,                  although
   references to "exceptional circumstances" in the  code  will  nonetheless
     entail a proportionality exercise.[153] But if the  relevant  group  of
   IRs is not such a            "complete  code"  then  the  proportionality
   test will be more at large, albeit guided              by the Huang tests
   and UK and Strasbourg case law.[154]


    26. The provisions  in  the  Rules  relating  to  those  subject  to  a
        deportation order were found to be a complete code as they  contain
        a provision for consideration of exceptional circumstances' if  the
        core requirements could not be met. Mr  Gishlla's  application  was
        refused by reference to E-ECP of Appendix FM which states:


              Section E-ECP: Eligibility for entry clearance as a partner


              E-ECP.1.1. To meet  the  eligibility  requirements  for  entry

   partnership, as specified.
              E-ECP.2.8. If the applicant is a fianc�(e) or  proposed  civil
   partner they            must be seeking entry to the UK to  enable  their
   marriage or civil                partnership to take place.
              E-ECP.2.9. Any previous relationship of the applicant or their
   partner             must have broken down permanently,  unless  it  is  a
   relationship which            falls  within  paragraph  278(i)  of  these
   Rules.
              E-ECP.2.10. The applicant and  partner  must  intend  to  live
   together                permanently in the UK.


              Financial requirements
              E-ECP.3.1. The applicant must provide specified evidence, from

                  (iii) an additional  �2,400  for  each  additional  child;
   alone or in                      combination with
              (b) specified savings of-
                  (i) �16,000; and
                  (ii) additional savings of an  amount  equivalent  to  2.5
   times the                    amount which is the difference  between  the
   gross  annual  income                    from  the  sources   listed   in
   paragraph  E-ECP.3.2.(a)-(d)  and  the   total                     amount

   18 years                when they were first  granted  entry  under  this
   route;
                  (b) applying for entry clearance as  a  dependant  of  the

   the                     Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006.


              E-ECP.3.2. When determining whether the financial  requirement
   in                  paragraph EECP.


              3.1. is met only the following  sources  will  be  taken  into
   account-
                  (a) income of the partner  from  specified  employment  or
   self-                    employment,  which,  in  respect  of  a  partner
   returning to the UK  with                   the  applicant,  can  include
   specified employment or self-employment                 overseas  and  in
   the UK;
                  (b) specified pension income of the applicant and partner;


                  (c)  any  specified  maternity  allowance  or  bereavement
   benefit                      received by the partner in the UK;
                  (d) other specified income of the applicant  and  partner;
   and
                  (e) specified savings of the applicant and partner.


              E-ECP.3.3. The requirements to be met under this paragraph are-


                  (a) the applicant's partner must be receiving one or  more
   of the                       following -
                  (i) disability living allowance;
                  (ii) severe disablement allowance;
                  (iii) industrial injury disablement benefit;
                  (iv) attendance allowance; or
                  (v) carer's allowance; and

   applicant and any                     dependants  adequately  in  the  UK
   without recourse to public funds.

   who are not included in the               application but who live in the
   same household, which the family own  or             occupy  exclusively:
   accommodation will not be regarded as adequate if-
              (a) it is, or will be, overcrowded; or
              (b) it contravenes public health regulations.


              English language requirement
              E-ECP.4.1. The applicant must provide specified evidence  that
   they-
              (a) are a national of  a  majority  English  speaking  country

              (b) have passed an  English  language  test  in  speaking  and

   English; or
              (d) are exempt from the  English  language  requirement  under

              E-ECP.4.2. The applicant is exempt from the  English  language

              (a) the applicant is aged 65 or over;
              (b)  the  applicant  has  a  disability  (physical  or  mental
   condition) which             prevents  the  applicant  from  meeting  the

              (c) there are  exceptional  circumstances  which  prevent  the
   applicant from               being able to meet the requirement prior  to
   entry to the UK.


              Section D-ECP: Decision on application for entry clearance  as
   a partner


              D-ECP.1.1. If the applicant meets the requirements  for  entry
   clearance as a               partner the applicant will be granted  entry
   clearance for an initial period           not exceeding  33  months,  and
   subject to a condition of no  recourse  to            public  funds;  or,
   where   the   applicant   is    a    fianc�(e)    or    proposed    civil
   partner, the applicant will be granted entry clearance for a  period  not
     exceeding 6 months, and subject to a condition of no recourse to public
              funds and a prohibition on employment.
              D-ECP.1.2. Where the applicant does not meet the  requirements
   for entry           clearance  as  a  partner  the  application  will  be
   refused.


    27. The rule does contain what appears to be a complete code in that it
        sets out mandatory requirements but does not contain any  reference
        to exceptional circumstances and so, as per the cases  referred  to
        above,  it  is  arguable  there  is   a   need   to   undertake   a
        proportionality      exercise      to       ascertain       whether
        exceptional/compassionate circumstances exist as per existing  case
        law.


    28. The Upper Tribunal  accept  there  is  family  life  recognised  by
        Article 8 between Mr Gushlla  and  his  sponsoring  wife.  Even  if
        family life is yet to be established  between  him  and  his  step-
        children they form part of the private lives of each other.


    29. The family maintain contact by indirect, and when  time  and  funds
        allow, direct means by visits  to  Kosovo  where  there  are  other
        family members who are able to assist.


    30. I note the emotional impact of separation and the strong desire for
        this family to be together and of the fact  the  sponsor  is  being
        tested on a quarterly basis to  check  if  she  has  breast  cancer
        although, to date, her prognosis is negative. The sponsor is to  be
        commended for her devotion to her husband and children and for  the
        assistance she gives, when time permits, to help  refugees  in  the
        North West with language issues.


    31. The Secretary of State's case is as set out above, that  unless  Mr
        Gushlla is able to meet the requirements  of  the  Rules  admission
        should be refused as there is nothing exceptional about the case on
        the facts. When considering  whether  there  are  any  non-standard
        and/or  particular  features  demonstrating  that  maintaining  the
        refusal will be unjustifiably harsh, the Tribunal  must  find  that
        this has not been proved  to  be  the  case  on  the  evidence  and
        material made available, at this time.  The sponsor referred  to  a
        situation in which she is unable to earn a greater  income  without
        her husband being admitted yet he cannot  be  admitted  unless  she
        earns the minimum level of income. I understand this dilemma but it
        has not been shown that no alternative positions are  available  or
        that alternative arrangements cannot be made so  as  to  facilitate
        the sponsor. If it was established this was the  case  or  she  was
        diagnosed with an illness which required additional support that is
        not available in the UK it may be different, but that  is  not  the
        case at the date of the hearing.


    32. In Razgar [2004] UKHL 27 Lord Bingham said that decisions taken  in
        pursuit of the lawful operation  of  immigration  control  will  be
        proportionate in all save a small  minority  of  exceptional  cases
        identifiable only on a case by case basis.  In the context of these
        comments it is arguable that a decision that accords with the Rules
        will generally be taken in  pursuit  of  the  lawful  operation  of
        immigration control.


    33. In the case of AAO v Entry Clearance Officer [2011]  EWCA  Civ  840
        the Court of Appeal held that, given the weakness  of  family  life
        and the lack of  a  positive  duty  which  imposed  on  the  UK  an
        obligation that went beyond making systematic allowance for a right
        of entry which was governed by carefully composed Immigration Rules
        and an overriding consideration of  Article  8  on  a  case-by-case
        basis, it was not possible to say that there had been a  breach  of
        Article  8.   As  Strasbourg   and   domestic   jurisprudence   had
        consistently emphasised, states were entitled  to  have  regard  to
        their system of immigration  control  and  a  requirement  that  an
        entrant should be maintained without recourse to public funds was a
        fair and  necessary  limitation  on  what  would  otherwise  be  an
        overwhelming burden on all its citizens.


    34. Having applied the current case law and the relevant rules, as  the
        2014 Act has no application to his decision, I find  the  Secretary
        of State has discharged  the  burden  of  proof  upon  her  to  the
        required standard to prove the decision  is  proportionate  to  the
        legitimate aim relied upon.


Decision

    35. The First-tier Tribunal Judge materially erred in law. I set  aside
        the decision of the  original  Judge.  I  remake  the  decision  as
        follows. This appeal is dismissed.


   Anonymity.


    36. The First-tier Tribunal did not make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
        45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
        2005. I make no such direction pursuant to rule 14 of the  Tribunal
        Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 as there was no  request  for
        anonymity which is not justified on the facts.

Upper Tribunal Judge Hanson
