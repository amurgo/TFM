                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1) The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan, born on 19 July 1963.  On 6  July
   2012 he applied for indefinite leave to  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom
   based on length of residence.  The respondent refused his application  by
   letter dated 28 May 2013.  One of the main points of refusal was that the
   respondent did not  accept  that  the  appellant  had  been  continuously
   resident in the United Kingdom for 14 years.

2) First-tier Tribunal Judge Balloch dismissed  the  appellant's  appeal  by
   determination promulgated on 13 January 2014.  At paragraph 38, the judge
   accepted that the appellant had been resident in the United  Kingdom  for
   over  14  years.   However,  he  failed  to  satisfy  paragraph  276B(iv)
   (sufficient knowledge of the English language and about life in the  UK),
   not having sat and passed the relevant test.

3) The first point taken for the appellant in the  Upper  Tribunal  is  that
   paragraph 276A(i) and 276A(ii) permit an application to  succeed  on  the
   basis of long residence without satisfying  paragraph  276B(iv),  to  the
   extent that a period not exceeding 2 years of  leave  to  remain  (rather
   than indefinite leave to remain) may be granted.

4) Mr Mullen's attention having been directed to the  relevant  findings  in
   the FtT determination and to the foregoing provisions of  the  Rules,  he
   fairly and properly conceded that it followed that the appellant's appeal
   should have been allowed under the Rules.

5)  The  determination  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  is  set  aside.   The
   following decision is substituted: under paragraphs 276A(i) and  276A(ii)
   of the Rules, the appeal is allowed.
