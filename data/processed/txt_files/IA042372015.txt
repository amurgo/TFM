Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr D Mills, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Appellant in person


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant Secretary of State appeals to  the  Upper  Tribunal  with
    permission against the decision and  reasons  statement  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Holt that was promulgated on 18 August 2015.  Judge Holt
    allowed the appeal against the Home Office decision of 12 January  2015
    in the belief that removing Ms [G] would be disproportionate on private
    and family life rights grounds, primarily because of Ms [G]'s child and
    partner.

 2. Ms [G] was without legal representation.  She attended the hearing with
    her partner and their son.  The Tribunal provided a Punjabi interpreter
    through whom I explained to Ms [G] and her family why the Secretary  of
    State challenged the judgment of Judge Holt and what my role was.    Ms
    [G] was content with my explanation and understood that part of my role
    was to ensure that she could participate in the proceedings.

 3. Mr Mills argued that Judge Holt had failed to have proper consideration
    to the question of whether it was unreasonable to expect Ms  [G]'s  son
    to leave the UK even though he has lived in the UK for well over  seven
    years.  Mr Mills reminded me that the  Court  of  Appeal  had  recently
    reviewed the law in this area (see MA  (Pakistan)  &  Ors,  R  (on  the
    application of) v Upper Tribunal (Immigration  and  Asylum  Chamber)  &
    Anor [2016] EWCA Civ 705) and although Judge Holt had no access to that
    judgment she should have been guided by the early guidance it upheld.

 4. As I indicated at the end of the hearing, I agree.  It  is  clear  that
    Judge Holt regarded the seven-years residence of Ms [G]'s son as if  it
    were a trump card.  It is not.  It is  also  evident  that  Judge  Holt
    failed to have full regard to Ms [G]'s family circumstances.   She  was
    living with her partner and their son, yet Judge Holt  failed  to  take
    account of the relationships.  Instead, Judge Holt regarded Ms  [G]  as
    having sole responsibility for the  child  ignoring  the  presence  and
    involvement of  the  child's  father.   The  situation  may  have  been
    somewhat confused since the Home Office has not indicated  what  action
    it proposes to take against Ms [G]'s partner, who appears  to  have  no
    current immigration status, but that did not prevent Judge Holt  having
    regard to the facts as presented.  On the face of it, the family should
    have been regarded as a unit and all aspects should have been assessed.

 5. Because I am satisfied Judge  Holt  erred  in  law,  I  set  aside  her
    decision and  reasons.   This  appeal  must  start  again  because  the
    approach taken means that insufficient findings were made by the First-
    tier Tribunal to enable me to remake the decision.  As per  the  Senior
    President's Practice  Statement,  this  is  an  appeal  which  must  be
    remitted for a fresh decision on all aspects.

 6. I direct that the appeal is remitted for a de novo hearing in the First-
    tier Tribunal by any judge other than Judge Holt.

Decision

The decision and reasons statement of Judge Holt contains an  error  of  law
and is set aside.

The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for  a  fresh  hearing  on
all issues before any judge other than Judge Holt.
