For the Respondent:    Ms A Everett, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria who was born on 13 May 1980.  She
    claims that she arrived in the United Kingdom, clandestinely, in  2005.
    On 4 August 2010 she was granted an EEA residence card (pursuant to the
    Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations  2006,  "the  2006
    Regulations") as the family member of Mr Luis Miguel Rebelo Dos Santos,
    a Portuguese national, whom she had married on 12 December  2009.   The
    residence card was valid until 4 August 2015.   On  31  July  2015  the
    appellant applied for permanent residence as a family  member  who  has
    retained the right of residence after the termination of her  marriage,
    the couple having commenced divorce proceedings  on  11  May  2015.   A
    decree absolute was issued on 5 October  2015.   That  application  was
    initially refused on 29 November 2015.  Following receipt of additional
    evidence the Secretary of State agreed to reconsider  the  application.
    The application was refused  once  again  on  17  December  2015.   The
    Secretary of State accepted that  the  appellant  was  married  to  the
    sponsor and that the marriage had lasted for three years and  that  the
    couple had spent at least one year  together  in  the  United  Kingdom.
    However, the respondent did not accept that the appellant had  provided
    evidence that the sponsor, her ex-husband, was a  qualified  person  at
    the point of divorce.

The appeal to the First-tier Tribunal

 2. The appellant appealed against the respondent's decision to the  First-
    tier Tribunal.  In a decision promulgated on 27 April  2017  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Courtney dismissed the appellant's  appeal.   The  judge
    was not satisfied that the appellant's former husband was  a  qualified
    person at the time of the divorce and therefore she  is  not  a  family
    member who has retained the right of residence.  The judge also went on
    to consider permanent right of  residence  and  found  that  there  was
    insufficient  evidence  that  the  appellant's  ex-husband   had   been
    exercising treaty rights and was therefore a  qualified  person  during
    the relevant period because there were significant  gaps  in  his  work
    history.

 3. The appellant applied for permission to appeal against  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's decision.  On 8  November  2017  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Pickup  refused  permission  to  appeal.   The  appellant  renewed  her
    application for permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  and  on  8
    January  2018  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Kamara  granted  the   appellant
    permission to appeal.

The hearing before the Upper Tribunal

 4. The appellant submits that  the  judge  erred  in  law  by  failing  to
    conclude that the appellant had established, by way  of  the  extensive
    payslips, the EEA national's evidence of employment  in  October  2015.
    There was an absence of reasoning  for  not  concluding  that  the  EEA
    national was qualified in view of  the  cogent  evidence  submitted  in
    respect of the relevant period.  The judge was not  entitled  to  reach
    the conclusion she did by noting that other evidence could be obtained.
    She was obliged to reach a decision on the evidence adduced.  The judge
    did not acknowledge the three  months'  payslips  covering  the  period
    August to December was good evidence She provided  no  reason  for  its
    rejection and proceeded to note the absence of other  evidence.   There
    is no proscribed form of evidence to establish that  the  EEA  national
    was a qualified person.  Without more, the conclusion of the  judge  at
    paragraph 20 cannot stand.  It is not transparent  why  the  apparently
    cogent evidence of the employment  was  rejected  by  the  judge.   The
    period August to December 2015 is a few months within a long history of
    employment.  It submitted that it is  artificial  and  unreasonable  to
    focus on the short period around 5 October 2015 and find  the  payslips
    inadequate in view of the very long history of employment  by  the  EEA
    national.

 5. The judge errs at paragraph 24 when he  concludes  in  the  alternative
    that the appellant has  not  established  that  the  EEA  national  has
    resided in the UK exercising treaty rights for any continuous period of
    five years from the date of marriage which was  December  2009.   While
    the judge noted the evidence that was there, including HMRC evidence of
    continuous  national  insurance  contributions  of   more   than   five
    continuous years, she considered the evidence for one period  as  being
    evidence of purely marginal and ancillary employment.  It is  submitted
    that the conclusion is perverse when the evidence is  looked  at  as  a
    whole.

 6. At the hearing Ms Iqbal submitted that the appellant  has  demonstrated
    that at the date of the  divorce  the  EEA  national  was  a  qualified
    person.  She submitted that the judge has applied too stringent a  test
    and imposed a higher threshold than required in terms of evidence.

 7. Ms Everett submitted that the findings were open  to  the  judge.   The
    burden is on the appellant to  discharge  the  burden  of  proof.   She
    accepted that there had been  no  challenge  to  the  validity  of  the
    payslips, however, those payslips ought to be considered  in  light  of
    the evidence overall.  If there were significant gaps in  the  evidence
    the judge was entitled to take that into  consideration  when  deciding
    what weight to attach to three isolated payslips.  She  submitted  that
    the judge had given sufficient reasons for the conclusions reached when
    the determination was looked at as a  whole.   She  accepted  that  the
    challenge on the basis that the judge applied too high a standard  with
    regard to the evidence required is a good  one  and  not  an  erroneous
    challenge.  However, the judge would have to satisfy himself  that  the
    appellant was married to a qualified person and  at  the  time  of  the
    divorce he  was  exercising  treaty  rights  -  in  this  case  through
    employment.

 8. Ms Iqbal argued that there was a considerable amount of cogent evidence
    in the case.  She referred  to  various  documents  that  were  in  the
    appellant's bundle which clearly demonstrated that her  ex-husband  had
    been exercising treaty rights for a period in excess of five years  and
    therefore the appellant met the permanent residence test.  She referred
    in particular to a number of documents in the bundle which demonstrated
    that the appellant's ex-husband had been exercising treaty rights  over
    a prolonged period, for example a letter from HMRC at page 122  of  the
    bundle which confirms that the appellant had fifteen  qualifying  years
    of national insurance contributions up to 5 April 2015.  At page 120 of
    the bundle there was another letter from HMRC showing between 2006  and
    2012 national insurance credits  and  at  page  127  which  set  out  a
    schedule from 2001 to 2014 of national  insurance  contributions  being
    paid.

 9. The judge considered two matters as argued in  the  skeleton  argument.
    Although the appellant had applied for a residence  card  as  a  person
    with a right to permanent residence the appeal was argued on the  basis
    that the application for a residence card was formulated as a residence
    card on  the  back  of  a  retained  right  of  residence.  The  judge,
    therefore, dealt firstly with the retained right of residence and  then
    the permanent residence issue. It was accepted by the  respondent  that
    the appellant met the requirements that there was  a  genuine  marriage
    that had lasted more than three years and that  the  couple  had  spent
    more than one year together in the UK. The  judge  considered  all  the
    evidence carefully in this case. She set out:

         "17. It is a general principle of Community  law  relating  to  the
             exercise of free movement rights  that,  except  where  it  is
             specified that only certain means of evidence are  admissible,
             evidence may be adduced by  any  appropriate  means  ...Member
             States have a degree of discretion in asking for evidence that
             the conditions are met.   There  are  no  specific  evidential
             requirements in the  Regulations,  but  the  Home  Office  has
             issued  Guidance.  ...This  provides  that  evidence  of  paid
             employment may include:

                . payslips dated no more than 6 weeks before the application
                  was made;

                . a letter from the employer confirming employment;

                . a contract of employment.

         18.  The Appellant states that as at the date  of  the  divorce  Mr
             Santos was working for Staffline Group Plc.  The appeal bundle
             includes copy payslips covering the 12-week period 21  August-
             13 November 2015.  These show that Mr Santos worked a  16-hour
             week @ �9.24 per hour, increasing to a 40-hour week as from 28
             August.  The most recent payslip indicates taxable pay to date
             of �11,963.40.  Ms Pinder submitted that the payslips had been
             served on the Respondent in  November  2016  as  part  of  the
             Appellant's bundle, allowing  ample  time  for  checks  to  be
             undertaken.  No issue had been taken by the Secretary of State
             with regard to the validity of Mr Santos' payslips.

         19.  There is no letter from the  employer  confirming  employment,
             and no contract of employment.  There are no  bank  statements
             showing earnings from Staffline going into Mr Santos' account,
             and no HMRC documents.  The  Appellant's  representatives  did
             not seek an 'Amos direction' requiring the Secretary of  State
             to supply any information necessary for the  determination  of
             their client's appeal.

         20.  I recognise that the Regulations  themselves  do  not  specify
             evidence, and the guidance is at most an aid  to  constriction
             of the Regulations.  However, the burden of proof  is  on  the
             Appellant to produce relevant  evidence  to  substantiate  her
             claim.  I am not satisfied, on the balance  of  probabilities,
             that Mrs Olalekan's former husband was a 'qualified person' at
             the time of the divorce.  She is not a family member  who  has
             retained the right of residence.

10. Dealing firstly  with  the  right  to  retained  residence,  the  judge
    accepted the payslips showed that  the  sponsor  worked  for  Staffline
    Group Plc during the period 21 August - 13 November 2015 and appears to
    have accepted the submission that  no  issue  had  been  taken  by  the
    respondent with regard to the  validity  of  the  payslips  (they  were
    served on the respondent  in  November  2016,  after  the  reasons  for
    reasons for refusal letter was issued). There is no requirement for any
    specified evidence (as recognised by the judge.). In the absence of any
    suggestion that the judge considered  that  these  documents  were  not
    valid it is not clear why the judge was not satisfied that the evidence
    was sufficient to demonstrate that the sponsor was employed at the date
    of divorce. The judge appears to have imposed  additional  requirements
    for evidence without giving any reasons for rejecting the evidence that
    was provided.  This was a material error of law.

11. The judge then  considered  the  permanent  right  of  residence  issue
    setting out:

         21.  Even if I am wrong in this conclusion, I do not consider  that
             the Appellant has established that she has acquired the  right
             to reside in the United Kingdom permanently  under  regulation
             15.

         22.  Regulation 15(1)(f) contains a  twofold  test.   An  applicant
             must first show that she has resided in the UK  in  accordance
             with these Regulations for a continuous period of  five  years
             (Regulation 15(1)(f)(i)), and then that  she  is  someone  who
             was, at the end of  that  period,  a  family  member  who  has
             retained the  right  of  residence.  ...For  the  purposes  of
             Regulation 15(1)(f) one must, in my judgment, have regard to a
             continuous period of  five  years  in  the  time  between  the
             marriage (12 December 2009) and the date of  the  hearing  (24
             March 2017).  Prior to the termination of the  marriage  on  5
             October 2015 the Appellant's residence was dependent  upon  Mr
             Santos' status as a qualified person.  Thereafter Mrs Olalekan
             has a retained right  of  residence  under  Regulation  10(5),
             assuming she can show that she herself has been  a  worker,  a
             self-employed person or a self-sufficient person  during  this
             period.

         23.  The EEA(PR):  guidance  notes  ...'detailed  guidance  on  the
             evidence you must submit if you are applying  for  a  document
             certifying permanent residence or permanent  residence  card'.
             With regard to employment the guidance provides as follows:

                . Letter from each employer confirming  the  dates  you/your
                  sponsor worked for them,  salary/wages,  normal  hours  of
                  work, and the reason the employment ended (if relevant);

                . Wage slips  and/or  bank  statements  showing  receipt  of
                  wages...;

                . P60s for each year in  which  you  were/your  sponsor  was
                  employed.

             If you can't submit the document above  (for  example,  you've
             lost the relevant documents, the employer is no longer trading
             or you are/your sponsor is unable to contact them), you should
             enclose a letter  explaining  why  not.   ...You  must  submit
             alternative evidence of the relevant employment, such as:

                . P45s;

                . signed contract of employment;

                . notice of redundancy;

                . letter accepting resignation;

                . letter of dismissal;

                . employment tribunal judgment relating to the employment.

         24.  As previously noted, prior to the termination of the  marriage
             on 5 October 2015 the Appellant's residence was dependent upon
             Mr Santos' status as a 'qualified person'.  However, there are
             significant gaps in his work history.  In particular, the only
             piece of evidence which touches upon  his  employment  in  the
             2014/15 tax year is an  HMRC  letter  dated  22  October  2015
             stating that Mr Santos had accrued 15 qualifying years NICs up
             to 5 April 2015.  With regard to the 2013/14 tax year there is
             evidence of paid employment with  First  Recruitment  Services
             Ltd, but his P45 shows total earnings of  only  �381.30.   The
             HMRC letter shows an NI contribution due in  2013/14  of  just
             �0.42.  This indicates activities on such a small scale as  to
             be regarded as purely marginal and ancillary.

         ...

         29.  I find that Mrs Olalekan does not  meet  the  requirements  of
             Regulation 15(1)(f) because there is insufficient evidence  to
             show that she has been residing in the UK in  accordance  with
             the Regulations for a continuous 5-year period."

12. Although the appellant relied considerably on the letter from HMRC that
    demonstrates that the appellant's ex-husband had accrued fifteen  years
    of qualifying national insurance contributions the last period recorded
    was 2013/14 and as that year showed minimal  contributions  of  42p  it
    does not demonstrate a continuous  period  of  five  years  during  the
    relevant period. The judge considered carefully all  the  documentation
    and was entitled to note that in the period 2013-2014  the  appellant's
    earnings were very minimal amounting to �381.30.  The minimum level  of
    earnings is reflected in  the  HMRC  letter,  indicating  the  national
    insurance contribution for that year was �0.42.  That year falls within
    the five year continuous qualifying period and is indicative  that  the
    appellant's ex-husband was unlikely to be exercising treaty  rights  in
    the UK continuously during that period.  It is  for  the  appellant  to
    demonstrate that he was exercising treaty rights, not for the  Tribunal
    Judge to reach a finding that he was not.  There was no error of law in
    respect of the judge's findings on permanent right of residence.

Re-making the retained right of residence issue

13. As set out above the appellant provided  payslips  covering  a  12-week
    period 21 August-13 November 2015.  These demonstrate that the  sponsor
    worked a 16-hour week, increasing to a 40-hour week as from 28  August.
    The  most  recent  payslip  indicates  taxable  pay  to  that  date  of
    �11,963.40. The respondent did take any issue regarding the validity of
    the payslips  either  prior  the  First-tier  Tribunal  hearing  or  in
    response to the grounds of appeal or  at  the  hearing  of  the  appeal
    before me. The respondent accepted that the  appellant  met  the  other
    requirements of Regulation 10 of the 2006 Regulations, i.e. that  there
    was a genuine marriage that had lasted more than three years  and  that
    the couple had spent more than one year together in the UK.  The  judge
    accepted that the appellant was working in the UK. I am satisfied  that
    the appellant meets the requirements of Regulation 10 - she is a family
    member who has a retained  the  right  of  residence.  The  appellant's
    appeal is allowed to this limited extent.

14. I ought to mention that an application was made for a  direction  under
    Rule 4(3)(d) of the Tribunal Procedure Rules that the Tribunal exercise
    its power to permit or require a party or  another  person  to  provide
    documents, information, evidence or submissions to the  Tribunal.   The
    appellant refers to the case of Amos v SSHD [2011] EWCA Civ 552.  I did
    not need to consider that application as I did not find an error of law
    in the  First-tier  Tribunal's  decision  on  the  permanent  right  of
    residence issue.

Notice of Decision

The appeal against the  First-tier  Tribunal's  decision  is  allowed  on  a
limited basis.
The appellant's appeal against the Secretary  of  State's  decision  on  the
retained right of residence issue is allowed.
The appeal against the  First-tier  Tribunal's  findings  on  the  permanent
right of residence issue is dismissed. The Secretary of State's decision  on
this issue therefore stands.

No anonymity direction is made.
