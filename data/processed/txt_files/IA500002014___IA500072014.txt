Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr I Jarvis, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Miss T Hyatt, Counsel, Rotherham & Co Solicitors

                                  Anonymity
The First-tier Tribunal made an order  pursuant  to  rule  45(4)(i)  of  the
Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
 I continue that order (pursuant  to  rule  14  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
(Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008)   and   consequently,   this   determination
identifies the appellants by initials only.

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   Both respondents are nationals of Gambia, the first  having  been  born
    on 29th December, 1978 and being the mother of  the  second  respondent
    who was born on 9th October, 2003.  References I make to the respondent
    henceforth are to the first named appellant.

2.   The respondent entered  the  United  Kingdom  on  7th  September,  2005
    having been granted an EEA family permit because of her marriage to AN,
    a Belgian national exercising treaty rights within the United  Kingdom.
    She was later granted a residence card valid until 10th November, 2012.
     Sadly, the respondent was divorced from her husband on 3rd June,  2012
    and by that time they had three children, the second respondent  and  R
    born on 8th January, 2007 and L, born on 13th April, 2010.

3.   On 18th October, 2012 the respondent sought permanent  residence  under
    the Immigration (European Economic Area)  Regulations  2006  which  was
    refused.  The respondent appealed that decision but  it  was  dismissed
    and the respondent became appeal rights exhausted on 19th June, 2014.

4.   On 27th June, 2014 the respondent sought a  derivative  residence  card
    under the 2006 Immigration (European Economic Area)  Regulations  which
    the respondent rejected.

5.   On 22nd August, 2014 the respondent again sought a  derivate  residence
    card for herself and for her son, the second respondent.

6.   As a result of that application being  refused,  she  appealed  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal and her appeal was  heard  by  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Chapman at Birmingham on 16th April, 2015.

7.   Counsel who appeared on behalf of the respondent  conceded  before  the
    judge that the appeal could not be allowed under the 2006  Regulations.
    The judge went on to consider the Article 8 rights  of  the  respondent
    and concluded that the decisions in respect  of  both  respondent  were
    disproportionate and purported to allow the appeals under Article 8.

8.    The  appellant  sought  to  challenge  the  decision  and  in   making
    application for permission to appeal pointed out  that  there  were  no
    removal directions and no Section 120 notice.  As a result, the  impact
    of the Secretary of State's decision on  the  respondent'  private  and
    family lives were minimal.

9.   Permission to appeal was subsequently granted.

10.  At the hearing before me Miss Hyatt suggested that the judge  may  well
    have been influenced by what was said by  the  Secretary  of  State  at
    paragraph 7 of page 5 of the reasons for refusal letter of 1st December
    2014.  There the Secretary of State simply said:

         "As you appear to have no alternative basis of stay in  the  United
         Kingdom you should now make arrangements to leave.  If you fail  to
         do so voluntarily your departure may be enforced.  In that event we
         would first contact  you  again  and  you  would  have  a  separate
         opportunity to make representations against the proposed removal."

11.  Counsel appeared to suggest that this paragraph in some  way  persuaded
    the judge that he had jurisdiction to hear the Article 8  appeal.   She
    also relied on the decision in JM (Liberia) and the decision  in  Nazir
    Ahmed v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2013] UKUT 00089.

12.  Mr Jarvis relied on the recent decision of the Tribunal in  Amirteymour
    and Others (EEA appeals; human rights) [2015] UKUT 00466, the head note
    for which says

         "Where no notice under section 120 of the 2002 Act has been  served
         and where no EEA decision to remove has  been  made,  an  appellant
         cannot bring a Human Rights challenge to removal in an appeal under
         the EEA Regulations. Neither the factual matrix nor  the  reasoning
         in JM (Liberia) [2006] EWCA Civ 1402 has any application to appeals
         of this nature".

13.  The respondent can of course at any time make an Article  8  appeal  to
    the Secretary of State by completing the necessary form and paying  the
    requisite fee.  In purporting to allow this  appeal  under  Article  8,
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Chapman has erred in law. In  dismissing  the
    appeal under the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations  2006
    the judge was correct and that part of the judge's decision is  upheld.
    That part allowing the respondent's  appeal  under  Article  8  is  set
    aside.

Notice of Decision

The Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department's  appeal  against  the
decision of First Tier Tribunal Judge  Chapman  to  allow  the  respondents'
Article 8 human rights appeal is allowed and that part of the  determination
is set aside.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
