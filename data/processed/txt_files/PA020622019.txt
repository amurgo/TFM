                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. This is an appeal against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Courtney ('the Judge') issued on 2 May 2019 by  which  the  appellant's
    appeal against the decision of the respondent to refuse  to  grant  him
    international protection was dismissed.

 2. In granting permission to appeal Upper Tribunal  Judge  Storey  granted
    permission on all grounds.



Anonymity

 3. The Judge did not issue an anonymity order.  This is a matter in  which
    the appellant has sought asylum.  I am mindful of Guidance  Note  2013,
    No 1 concerned with anonymity orders and I observe  that  the  starting
    point for consideration of anonymity orders  in  this  chamber  of  the
    Upper Tribunal, as in  all  courts  and  Tribunals,  is  open  justice.
    However, I note paragraph 13 of the Guidance Note where it is confirmed
    that it is the present practice of both  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and
    this Tribunal that an anonymity order is made in  all  appeals  raising
    asylum or other international protection claims.

 4. Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 (SI 2008/269)  I  make  an  anonymity  order.   Unless  the  Upper
    Tribunal or a court directs otherwise, no report of  these  proceedings
    or any  form  of  publication  thereof  shall  directly  or  indirectly
    identify the appellant.  This direction applies to, amongst others, the
    appellant  and  the  respondent.   Any  failure  to  comply  with  this
    direction could give rise to contempt of court proceedings.  I do so in
    order to avoid a likelihood of serious harm arising  to  the  appellant
    from the publication of the contents of his protection claim.



Background

 5. The appellant is accepted by the respondent to be aged 20.  He  asserts
    that he is a Syrian citizen, though the respondent believes him to be a
    national of Egypt.  The appellant asserts that he left Syria when  aged
    either 12 or 13 and lived in Egypt for approximately  one  year  before
    relocating to Greece where he stayed for two years.   He  entered  this
    country clandestinely  on  18  October  2015  and  claimed  asylum  the
    following day.  The respondent refused the appellant's asylum claim  by
    way of a decision dated 8 April  2016  but  granted  him  discretionary
    leave to remain as an unaccompanied asylum-seeking child  until  5  May
    2016.

 6. The appellant made a further asylum application on 3 May 2016 which was
    refused by the respondent by way of a decision dated  5  October  2016.
    The decision letter was wrongly addressed, and  effective  service  was
    only achieved on 21 February 2019.

 7.  In  refusing  the  application  for  international   protection,   the
    respondent relied upon a language analysis test report dated  29  March
    2016 which concluded that the linguistic  behaviour  displayed  by  the
    appellant was not consistent with an Arabic linguistic  community  that
    is represented in Aleppo, Syria.  The results were identified as  being
    consistent with the linguistic community situated in  the  Nile  Delta,
    Egypt.



Hearing before the First-tier Tribunal

 8. The appeal came before the Judge at Hatton Cross on 17 April 2019.   In
    dismissing the appeal, the Judge made a number of  adverse  credibility
    findings.  Of relevance to this appeal are paragraphs 25, 29 and 30  of
    the decision.

         "25. If the Appellant left Aleppo at the age of 13 this  would  fix
             his departure date as some time after November 2011.   In  his
             first witness statement (dated 12 January 2016) the  Appellant
             makes no mention of the war as a reason for leaving Syria.  He
             alludes to it in a somewhat throwaway and distanced  reference
             in the penultimate paragraph: "I also know about the war going
             on in Syria, it is not a safe place to live, bombs  are  being
             thrown  from  planes  the  situation  is  bad  and   therefore
             returning back will be very difficult" [WS1 �5].   During  his
             Screening interview on 29 December 2015 he was asked if he was
             afraid something bad would happen to him if he  returned  home
             and he  replied:  "I  will  expect  anything.   ISIS  teaching
             children weapons" [para 4.2].  At interview on 2 March 2016 he
             said that the  reason  he  went  to  Egypt  was  because  "The
             education [in Syria] is compulsory education.  I couldn't stay
             remaining on the street" (AIR Q13).   In  his  second  witness
             statement the Appellant says: "I believe my life is  still  at
             risk in Syria.  I believe that I would be  arrested,  tortured
             and possibly killed either by the government or  the  opposing
             forces.  I left Syria when I was very young and I do not  want
             to witness what I witnessed there  again"  [WS2  �12].   Quite
             what it was that he witnessed he does not say.

         ...

         29.  In his witness statement the Appellant says: "The Home  Office
             asked me  about  the  Syrian  independence  day.   I  answered
             correctly that Syria got independence from  France.   However,
             it is true I was not aware of the exact date.  I do not  think
             this is unusual.  As stated above, I was  still  a  child  and
             such things were not important to me at the time.  I was  only
             aware of the main events such as Eid.  The situation in  Syria
             was too chaotic for us to be even thinking about such  things"
             [WS �11].  It was not just the date that he failed to  mention
             but the very fact that there was  such  an  even,  saying  "We
             didn't celebrate the independence day" (AIR Q52).  Asked  what
             public holidays were celebrated in Syria, other  than  Ramadan
             and EID, the Appellant replied:  "There  is  nothing  else  we
             celebrate in Syria.  Syria doesn't have  celebration,  it  has
             blood" (AIR Q53).  I take judicial notice  of  the  fact  that
             Independence Day on 17 April is one of Syria's most  important
             national holidays, which is marked with firework displays  and
             celebrations across the country.  As previously noted, it  was
             not until early 2012 that security forces in Aleppo  began  to
             be targeted with bombings, and it was late  July  2012  before
             the conflict reached Aleppo in earnest.  For the first  12  or
             13 years of his life there would have been no  inhibitions  on
             marking Independence Day.

         30.  Asked at interview to name some towns or villages near  Aleppo
             the Appellant gave the examples of Al Raqqa, Dara'a and El Bab
             (AIR Q22).  When it was put to him that Dara'a and Raqqah were
             a considerable distance away from Aleppo (they are  460km  and
             210km away respectively) the Appellant said: "This is the ones
             I know that are close to Aleppo.  I didn't  leave  this  small
             place.  I never been and didn't go there" (AIR Q58).   In  his
             skeleton argument Mr Bisson submits that "The  Respondent  has
             failed to take into consideration the  Appellant's  young  age
             and lack of education when questioning him on the geography of
             cities that he has never visited.  Weight should be  given  to
             the fact that the Appellant was  able  to  name  other  cities
             outside Aleppo.  The Respondent  also  conveniently  fails  to
             give the example of El Bab that the Appellant  provides  as  a
             city near Aleppo" [� 11].  I take judicial notice of the  fact
             that Al-Bab is located 40 kilometres northeast of Aleppo."




Grounds of Appeal

 9. In granting permission to appeal, Upper Tribunal Judge Storey observed,



         "Given that the appellant was a minor when he arrived in the UK and
         was still a minor when the respondent refused his asylum appeal, it
         is arguable  that  the  judge  failed  to  assess  the  appellant's
         credibility regarding his nationality (which the appellant said was
         Syrian and the  respondent  said  was  Egyptian)  and  his  adverse
         experiences in Syria in the context that the appellant was a  minor
         at  the  time  and  that  some  allowances  had  to  be  made   for
         discrepancies and more emphasis placed on objective evidence.   The
         grounds disclose an arguable error of law and all (including  those
         relating to the linguistic report) are arguable."

10. No Rule 24 response was filed by the respondent.



Decision on Error of Law

11. Both representatives at the hearing  informed  me  that  they  were  in
    agreement that the Judge's decision  was  flawed  by  legal  error  and
    should be set aside.  The Judge criticised evidence  presented  by  the
    appellant whilst he was a child both during the course  of  his  asylum
    interview and also in  a  witness  statement  prepared  in  2016.  When
    considering such evidence both representatives before me accepted  that
    the Judge was required to remind herself as to the  Joint  Presidential
    Guidance Note No 2 of 2010, concerned with children, vulnerable  adults
    and sensitive appellants.  The guidance details  at  paragraph  10.3(i)
    that when assessing evidence provided by a child,  a  Judge  is  to  be
    aware that children often do not provide as much detail  as  adults  in
    recording experiences and may often manifest  their  fears  differently
    from adults.

12. I observe at paragraph 25 of the decision that the Judge is critical of
    the appellant for not mentioning issues in  his  statement  of  January
    2016.  At this time, he was aged 17 and was a  minor.   There  is  also
    criticism in that paragraph as to his failure to explain matters during
    his screening interview in 2015, a time again when he was a child.   At
    paragraph 29 the Judge was critical  as  to  the  appellant's  lack  of
    knowledge in interview as to Independence  Day  in  Syria.   Again,  no
    consideration is given to the fact that  this  evidence  was  presented
    whilst the appellant was a child. I find that it  is  clearly  apparent
    from reading the decision and reasons that the Judge did not  have  the
    Presidential Guidance firmly in mind when making adverse criticisms  as
    to the recollection of a child witness.  I accept the  representatives'
    submissions that the failure to consider the Presidential Guidance is a
    material error of law because the adverse findings flowed into the rest
    of the Judge's decision.

13. Having found that the Judge materially erred in law as to ground  1,  I
    do not proceed to consider grounds 2 - 6.



Remittal

14. As to remaking the decision, given the nature of the errors,  I  accept
    the submissions made by both Ms Jones and Mr Bisson that clear findings
    of fact have to be made and evidence provided.  Both  advocates  submit
    that the appeal should be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal.  I  have
    given careful consideration to the  Joint  Practice  Statement  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal and  Upper  Tribunal  concerning  the  disposal  of
    appeals in this Tribunal that reads as follows at paragraph 7.2  and  I
    quote:

         "7.2 The Upper Tribunal is likely on each occasion  to  proceed  to
             remake the decision, instead of  remitting  the  case  to  the
             First-tier Tribunal, unless the Upper  Tribunal  is  satisfied
             that:

             (a)  the effect of the error  has  been  to  deprive  a  party
                  before the First-tier Tribunal of a fair hearing or rather
                  opportunity for that party's case to be put and considered
                  by the First-tier Tribunal; or

             (b)  the nature or extent of any judicial  fact-finding  which
                  is necessary in order for the decision in the appeal to be
                  remade is such  that,  having  regard  to  the  overriding
                  objective in Rule 2, it is appropriate to remit  the  case
                  to the First-tier Tribunal."

15. I have reached the conclusion that it  is  appropriate  to  remit  this
    matter to the First-tier Tribunal for a fresh decision on all  matters.
    The Appellant has enjoyed no adequate consideration of his asylum claim
    to date and has not yet had a fair hearing.



Notice of Decision

16. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    on a point of law and I set aside the Judge's decision promulgated on 2
    May 2019 pursuant to Section  12(2)(a)  of  the  Tribunal,  Courts  and
    Enforcement Act 2007.

17. This matter is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for a fresh  hearing
    before any Judge other than Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  Courtney.



18. No findings of fact are preserved.
