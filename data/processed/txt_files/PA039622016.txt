For the Appellant: Mr C Lane instructed by Braitch RB Solicitors.
For the Respondent: Mr Mills Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS




     1. This is an appeal against a decision of First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
        Hussain ('the Judge') promulgated on 27 October 2016 in  which  the
        Judge dismissed the appellant's appeal against the refusal  of  his
        claim for international protection and/or for a grant of  leave  to
        remain on human rights grounds.



Background


     2. The appellant was born on 1 April 1997 and is a citizen of Iran.
     3. The Judge noted the appellant's immigration history  and  basis  of
        claim, that the appellant was a former police officer in  Iraq  and
        whilst there faced threats from ISIS because he, like his  brother,
        was involved in arresting members of ISIS. The  appellant  asserted
        that threats from ISIS became real when  an  explosion  took  place
        outside the family home.
     4. The Judge sets out the findings of fact from [7]  to  [25]  of  the
        decision which may be summarised in the following terms:


   a. The appellant is not credible [7].
   b. The appellant was not consistent about his  date  of  birth  or  large
      parts of his evidence. The appellant was aware of his  date  of  birth
      but has given two different dates. The date  of  birth  given  in  the
      screening interview was changed to match the  date  of  birth  on  the
      police ID documents subsequently produced [8].
   c. Whichever date of birth is adopted to the appellant was 16  years  old
      when he claims he joined the police although  the  appellant  go  also
      gave an inconsistent account of when he joined the police; claiming in
      his substantive interview it was March 2013,  in  oral  evidence  July
      2013, whereas his police ID card is dated from September 2013 [8].
   d. The appellants age, so far as it relates to  employment  as  a  police
      officer, is an important factor as  the  Iraqi  constitution  and  law
      prohibits child labour and employment and work detrimental to  health,
      safety, or morals for anyone under 18 [9].
   e. The appellant claimed to have undertaken dangerous work at the age  of
      16 having been trained in the use of weapons and  going  on  raids  to
      arrest ISIS members and being involved in firefights.  The  Judge  was
      not satisfied the State of  Iraq  would  employ  a  juvenile  in  such
      circumstances. In light of that, the Judge was not satisfied that  the
      appellant was a member of the Iraqi police force [9].
   f. The Judge did not find it credible that a 16-year-old will be employed
      as a bodyguard for somebody much older and more powerful than  he  was
      [10].
   g. The appellant's brother for whom he was a bodyguard  is  also  in  the
      United Kingdom, they live together, but the brother did not attend  to
      give oral evidence. His absence was unexplained and detracted from the
      weight given to the appellant's account [11].
   h. The appellant remained in Iraq despite the claimed  explosion  outside
      the family home,  from  January  2014  to  May  2015.  There  were  no
      incidents during this time and no threats to him or his family.  There
      was no trigger incident in May 2015 forcing  him  to  leave.  In  oral
      evidence the appellant claimed he left Iraq because  the  family  were
      living in one room but, when challenged, changed his evidence  to  say
      he left because  he  did  not  want  to  endanger  his  family.   Such
      inconsistency damaged his credibility [12].
   i.  The  explanation  for  leaving  to  protect  the  family  was   found
      implausible because the family suffered no harm for at  least  the  14
      months that he was with them, despite  an  alleged  letter  from  ISIS
      threatening violence against the family [12].
   j. The appellant's credibility is damaged by his failure to claim  asylum
      in France despite being there for 2 ï¿½ months [13].
   k. The appellant is from Kirkuk [17].
   l. The appellant's parents and family still live in Iraq in their village
      in the area where, despite the claimed threat from  ISIS,  they  lived
      with the appellant without incident [18].
   m. The appellant is in regular contact with his father and other  members
      of the family. His father posted the ID documents to him.  The  family
      still live in the same house and have come to no harm  or  experienced
      any difficulty. The village is 70 to 80 km from Kirkuk [18].
   n. Since his substantive interview the appellant has obtained  his  Iraqi
      nationality documents making return to Iraq feasible [19].
   o. There is no reason  why  the  appellant  cannot  return  to  the  Iraq
      Kurdistan Region (IKR) [20 - 21].
   p. The appellant would not be destitute in the IKR.  The appellant claims
      to have worked in the past and could find work as a labourer  but,  if
      not, his family including his father live nearby and would be able  to
      support him or he could return to live with the family in the  village
      where they have lived without incident for some time [22].
   q. If returned to Baghdad,  there  are  flights  every  second  day  from
      Baghdad. The appellant would not become destitute as his family  could
      provide support as they did when  they  helped  him  leave  Iraq.  The
      appellant speaks basic Arabic. Any difficulties would be short  lived.
      Even if  the  stay  in  Baghdad  was  for  a  significant  period  the
      appellant's father could forward his CSID document to him which  would
      enable the appellant to obtain  some  financial  assistance  from  the
      authorities, education, housing and medical treatment. Taking all into
      account, the appellant will face little  or  no  risk  of  destitution
      amounting to serious harm in Baghdad [23].
   r. Internal relocation would not be unduly harsh [24].
   s. The appellant did not pursue any other claim including Article 8  ECHR
      [25].


     5. The Judge concludes by finding the appellant does not  qualify  for
        asylum or Article 15 (c) protection but even  if  he  did,  he  can
        internally relocate to the IKR  or  Baghdad  without  facing  undue
        hardship.
     6. The appellant sought permission to  appeal  which  was  granted  by
        another judge of the First-tier Tribunal. The  operative  parts  of
        the grant of permission being in the following terms:


        3.   The grounds disclose arguable errors of law in at least  three
        respects.


        4.    Firstly, it is arguable that in relying on the failure of the
             Appellant's brother to give  evidence  in  stating  that  this
             undermined the Appellant's credibility, the  Judge  materially
             erred as it was a different brother who the Appellant  claimed
             to have worked as a bodyguard for, and it is  not  clear  what
             evidence the brother in the United Kingdom  could  have  given
             that would have enhanced the Appellant's claim.


        5.   Secondly, it is arguable that the Judge has  materially  erred
             in extrapolating constitutional norms in a collapsed state  to
             apply to the Appellant when there is a civil war,  to  justify
             the finding that it did not work as a police officer.


        6.   Thirdly, it is arguable that the Judge has materially erred in
             dismissing the Appellant's account before considering  the  ID
             produced, and has not  considered  the  documentation  in  the
             round as part of the claim itself before reaching  conclusions
             on credibility.



Error of law


     7. It was submitted on the appellant's behalf that  the  inconsistency
        in  relation  to  the  appellant's  date  of  birth  had  not  been
        adequately dealt with by the Judge. It was asserted  there  was  no
        cross-examination on this issue and  that  it  was  a  matter  that
        should have been put before the appellant for comment.
     8. At [8]  the  Judge  notes  that  in  his  screening  interview  the
        appellant gave a date of birth of 1 April 1997 which he changed  to
        21  February  1997  to  match  the  police  document.  There  is  a
        discrepancy in these two dates, although the Judge did not find the
        discrepancy of significance to the core element of the  claim  that
        the appellant was at risk as a former police officer who had  faced
        threats from ISIS, for on both dates of birth the  appellant  would
        have been claiming to have been 16 years of age when he joined  the
        police.
     9. The Judge was entitled to note the discrepancy and to consider that
        together with all the other evidence the appellant was  seeking  to
        rely upon. In relation to the assertion matters  should  have  been
        put to the appellant, such claim does not  make  out  any  arguable
        legal error. Proceedings within  this  jurisdiction  are  by  their
        nature adversarial. The  appellant  was  represented  by  Mr  Lane,
        competent and  experienced  counsel,  who  would  have  been  in  a
        position either in evidence in  chief  or  re-examination  to  have
        raised issues that needed clarifying. If, for whatever  reason,  no
        further evidence was adduced in relation to this  issue  the  Judge
        was perfectly entitled to consider the available material.  It  has
        not been shown the finding of an inconsistence is arguably perverse
        or irrational or outside the range of permitted findings, in  light
        of the discrepancy, or that the appellant did not  receive  a  fair
        hearing with ample opportunity to advance his case  and  deal  with
        issues that arose, before  the  First-tier  Tribunal.  No  arguable
        legal error is made out on this ground.
    10. In relation to the finding by the Judge that the Iraq  State  would
        not employ the appellant as a police officer, it was submitted  the
        Judge erred as evidence was put forward that the country  is  in  a
        state of internal conflict in which the usual rule of law is  often
        breached and that evidence was cited from  the  objective  evidence
        that children were being used in the  conflict,  although  Mr  Lane
        accepted that this mostly related to militia groups. Legal error is
        submitted in  the  Judge  failing  to  consider  the  evidence  and
        submissions and arriving at a conclusion that  was  too  simplistic
        and contrary to what is known about how States act generally during
        conflict.
    11. The Judge had available to him and appeal bundle including  a  2015
        US State Department country report on  human  rights  practices  in
        Iraq, dated 13 April 2016.
    12. Mr Lane made specific reference  to  the  section  of  that  report
        headed "Child Soldiers" in support of his argument but it is  noted
        at page 160 - 161 of the appellant's bundle, in  the  said  report,
        that it is written :


        The were no reports that ISF conscripted or recruited  children  to
        serve in the security services. According to the report of  the  UN
        Secretary-General on children and armed conflict in Iraq,  released
        in November, while there were no instruction for children  to  join
        fighting, children continued to be associated with PMF and militias
        in all conflict  areas.  UN  observers  reported  children  wearing
        military  uniforms  and  carrying  weapons,  as  well  as  parading
        alongside adult members of armed groups. The report stated that  on
        June 7, the Ministry of Youth  and  Sport  sent  a  letter  to  its
        directorates in all governorates encouraging the use of youth clubs
        for military training of youth.


        On July 28, the  Associated  Press  reported  its  staff  witnessed
        dozens of camps  around  the  country  with  hundreds  of  students
        training to join the PMF and fight  Da'esh.  A  spokesman  for  the
        Prime Ministers Office responded that there were isolated incidents
        of underage fighters joining combat on their  own  but  that's  the
        government did not condone children going to war.  Observers  noted
        there were no official encouragement for children to join militias,
        which occurred infrequently and generally due  to  family  or  peer
        encouragement.


    13. The issue before the Judge did not relate to whether the  appellant
        had joined a militia group. The specific claim by the appellant was
        that he joined the police force and engaged in the type of  conduct
        the Judge found was contrary to the Iraqi constitution. In relation
        to the material relied upon by Mr Lane  there  is  no  evidence  to
        support the contention raised in the grounds that the alleged state
        of disorder is the norm in Iraq to the extent the  constitution  is
        ignored. It is accepted that some areas of Iraq have been found  to
        be in a state of internal armed conflict, but this does  not  apply
        to all parts of the country.  Whilst the state  of  governance  may
        not be the same as that in other countries around the world  it  is
        not made out that the country is  in  such  a  state  of  chaos  or
        disorder that the restriction in  relation  to  the  employment  of
        children in dangerous roles is relaxed, or undermined, such  as  to
        impact upon the finding by the  Judge  on  this  point.  There  is,
        indeed, in relation to the appellant's own evidence no report  that
        the Iraqi Security Forces  (ISF)  conscripted  or  recruited  child
        soldiers.
    14. It has not been made out that the finding by the Judge in  relation
        to this issue was not reasonably open to the Judge on the evidence.
        No arguable legal error is made out on this point.
    15.  Mr  Lane  also  submitted  the  Judge  had  erred  in  relying  on
        implausibilities in relation to the account.  This  is  a  case  in
        which the findings  are  not  based  solely  on  plausibility  and,
        indeed, the weight to be given to the evidence was a matter for the
        Judge bearing in mind issues such as the appellant's claim to  have
        joined the police force aged  15  and  have  engaged  in  dangerous
        activities was not supported by the country  information.  This  is
        not a claim to have joined a militia group or ISIS, where  the  use
        of child soldiers is recognised, but the Iraq Security Forces where
        there was insufficient evidence to show that the Judge's conclusion
        regarding the use of underage individuals  was  not  a  sustainable
        finding. Adequate reasons have been given to the findings made  and
        the weight to be given to the evidence was a matter for the Judge.
    16. The assertion the appellant referred to the wrong brother  at  [11]
        is accepted by Mr Mills as the appellant has a brother lawfully  in
        the United Kingdom as well as brothers in Iraq. The issue  is  not,
        however, whether the Judge erred in law when assessing the identity
        of the brother,  but  whether  the  error  made  is  material.  The
        assertion made by the appellant is that as a result of  that  error
        the overall assessment of the appellant's credibility cannot stand.
        This has not been made out. It is not disputed that the brother  in
        the United Kingdom did not give oral  evidence  on  behalf  of  the
        appellant, although it is accepted that the brother in  the  United
        Kingdom may not have personal knowledge of what occurred  in  Iraq.
        The finding by the Judge that the failure of the brother to  attend
        and give  oral  evidence  detracted  weight  from  the  appellant's
        account may not be a sustainable finding, although it has not  been
        shown the amount of negative weight that may  have  been  given  to
        this matter was a determinative factor. This, for example,  has  no
        impact upon the Judge's findings in relation to the core account to
        have joined the police and the age issue, sufficient  to  make  out
        they are not safe and sustainable findings. No material  error  has
        been arguably made out.
    17. Paragraph 7 of the grounds was not pursued by Mr Lane who  did  not
        seek to rely upon the same.
    18. Paragraph 8 of  the  grounds  relates  to  the  section  8  adverse
        credibility  findings,  which  are  challenged  on  the  basis  the
        appellant is a man of young age with an older brother in the United
        Kingdom who could help him which was the excuse  for  not  claiming
        asylum earlier. The fact the appellant was deliberately seeking  to
        enter the United Kingdom where he had a brother does  not  arguably
        excuse him  from  the  option  of  claiming  asylum,  which  is  an
        application  for  international   protection,   at   the   earliest
        opportunity. What the appellant's actions suggest is that he had no
        intention of claiming asylum until he arrived at  the  jurisdiction
        of his choice when he would make such a claim. It has not been made
        out why the appellant could not have claimed  asylum  the  earliest
        opportunity for, if he succeeded, he may have been able to join his
        brother in any event. The explanation provided  does  not  admit  a
        finding of legal error material to the  Judge's  decision  on  this
        basis.
    19. In relation to the ID document, it was asserted the Judge found the
        appellant lacked credibility and therefore found the  documents  to
        be of no assistance whereas if the Judge was finding the  documents
        are forged, the onus would be on the respondent to prove this fact.
        It is asserted the Judge should have considered  whether  documents
        were true or not and, if true, the extent to which they backup  the
        appellant's  account.  It  is  stated  the  Judge  erred   in   not
        considering the documents to be true as a result  of  the  date  of
        birth issue which it is asserted was not put to  the  appellant,  a
        matter that has been disposed of above. Mr Lane  also  asserted  an
        artificial separation by the Judge who should have  considered  the
        documents as part of the claim.
    20. The document is considered by the Judge at [14] where the following
        findings are made:


         14.  These are some of the reasons why did not find  the  appellant
             to be credible. My main finding that he was not in the  police
             force means that he did not receive the  claimed  threat  from
             ISIS nor that there was an explosion outside their house  both
             which occurred because the appellant claimed he was  a  police
             officer. It also goes without saying that I place no weight on
             the police ID documents produced by the appellant. I therefore
             dismiss his asylum claim.


    21. Had this been all the Judge said there may have been merit  in  the
        submission by Mr  Lane  of  artificial  separation,  in  the  Judge
        deciding the account was not credible but then using  this  finding
        to place no weight upon the ID document rather than considering the
        document as part of the overall claim. This was, however,  not  all
        the Judge did for at [8] it is found:


         8.   The appellant was not consistent about his date  of  birth  as
             indeed he wasn't  about  large  parts  of  his  evidence.  The
             appellant is clearly aware of his date of birth and  the  fact
             that  he  has  given  two   different   dates,   damages   his
             credibility. At his screening interview, he gave his  date  of
             birth as 1 April 1997. This was  subsequently  changed  to  21
             February 1997 to match the date of  birth  on  the  police  ID
             documents that he subsequently produced. The significance,  if
             any, of the date of birth, can only relate to  whether  it  is
             claimed that he was either the child or  a  juvenile  when  he
             joined the Iraqi police force. However, on closer examination,
             the  discrepancy,  other   than   damaging   the   appellant's
             credibility, is of no significance because,  no  matter  which
             date of birth is adopted, the appellant was 16 years old  when
             he says that he joined the police. As with his date of  birth,
             he gave an inconsistent account of when he joined the  police.
             In his substantive interview, he said that he joined in  March
             2013, in his oral evidence, he said that  he  joined  in  July
             2013 where as his police ID card is dated from September  2013
             suggesting that that is when  he  joined.  Whichever  date  of
             birth is used, he was, on all of those dates, 16 years of age.


    22. The  Judge  clearly  factored  the  police  ID  document  into  the
        assessment of the evidence at a much earlier stage in the  decision
        than [14]. Having considered the evidence as a whole the Judge  was
        fully entitled to decide that no weight could be  placed  upon  the
        police document. The Judge does not find the ID is  forged  and  no
        evidential burden arises upon the Secretary of  State  to  prove  a
        forgery. The statement in paragraph 9 of the grounds that the Judge
        "seems to be saying" that they must be forgeries misrepresents  the
        actual finding that no weight may be placed upon the evidence.  The
        police ID document may be a genuine document in that  it  has  been
        deliberately prepared in the form that was provided  to  the  Judge
        even though what it purports to represent is  not  consistent  with
        the evidence taken as a whole. The Judge was entitled to place  the
        weight he considered it was appropriate to place  on  the  document
        without needing to  consider  the  forgery  issue.  This  is  amply
        demonstrated within this jurisdiction when dealing with  ETS  cases
        in which there may be what on the face of it appears to be a  valid
        English language certificate, upon which no weight may be placed in
        terms of  accepting  what  the  certificate  purports  to  show  in
        relation to an appellant's English language ability,  as  the  test
        which gave rise to the marks recorded in the certificate was  taken
        by a third party. The certificate is not  necessarily  forged  even
        though the actions of an appellant are deceitful.
    23. Mr Lane challenges the Judges conclusions in relation to  the  area
        of Iraq in which the appellant could  return  by  reference  to  AA
        (Article 15(c)) Iraq CG [2015] UKUT 544. The appellant asserts  the
        Judge erred by saying he cannot return to his home area  of  Kirkuk
        but then at [22] that he can return to that area. There is  also  a
        challenge to the findings in the  alternative  that  the  appellant
        could go to the IKR which it is said  the  Judge  was  required  to
        assess by reference to whether it would be  unduly  harsh  for  the
        appellant to settle there. The appellant challenges the findings of
        the Judge that the appellant could seek employment in the  IKR  and
        the findings in relation to the conditions the appellant would face
        on  return  to  Baghdad.  The  appellant  asserts   that   internal
        relocation is not reasonable and that there will be a real risk  of
        Article 3 ECHR real treatment such that the finding is infected  by
        arguable legal error.
    24. The Judge was aware of the country guidance caselaw and  notes  the
        claim for humanitarian of subsidiary protection from [15]  and  the
        fact that in AA the Secretary of State accepted that  Kirkuk  is  a
        contested area, notwithstanding that from mid/end 2014 the  Kurdish
        forces had defeated ISIS and forced them from Kirkuk which  was  at
        that point under Kurdish control, and has remained so  ever  since.
        The Judge finds the appellant can return to  his  home  area  where
        there was no evidence of incidents or a credible threat. The  Judge
        noted that the village was some 70 to 80 km from Kirkuk. This is  a
        relevant finding for Kirkuk is about 87 km from  Erbil  and  96  km
        from Sulaimaniya, the major cities in the IKR and areas in relation
        to which it has been accepted there has never been a real  risk  of
        harm sufficient to warrant a grant of international protection. The
        reality of the matter is that even if the city of Kirkuk was at the
        time of ISIS occupation  within  a  contested  area,  the  evidence
        before the Judge was that there was no real risk in the appellant's
        home area. The Judge was required to assess risk at the date of the
        hearing of the appeal which  was  20  October  2016.  It  was  also
        submitted by Mr Mills that there have been further advances against
        ISIS in Mosul and other areas outside the  appellant's  home  area,
        which is arguably correct.  A reading of the material  provided  to
        the Judge also shows there is no evidence that the appellant's home
        area was ever under the control of ISIS. As such, the Judge was not
        required to find there was a real risk pursuant to Article  15  (c)
        in the appellant's home area as the evidence did not support such a
        conclusion. The finding the appellant was able  to  return  to  his
        home area has not been shown to be a finding infected  by  arguable
        legal error.
    25. The assertion by the appellant that his CISD makes return  feasible
        is not in accordance with AA which states that  what  makes  return
        feasible is either the possession of an Iraqi passport or a laissez
        passï¿½. The applicant has his identity document so he should be able
        to obtain a passport from the Iraq Embassy in the United Kingdom to
        facilitate his return. The appellant has failed to  establish  this
        is not so. The Judge also found the  appellant  maintained  contact
        with his parents and there is  therefore  no  evidence  that  other
        documents could not be obtained, if required.
    26. It is accepted that the country material refers to  the  influx  of
        refugees into the Kurdish area but as the finding the appellant can
        return to his home area has  not  been  shown  to  be  infected  by
        arguable legal error, the issue of internal flight does not  arise.
        The  appellant  is  of  Kurdish  ethnicity  and  with   appropriate
        documentation could return directly to the IKR if pre-clearance  is
        obtained, in accordance with established practice, from the Kurdish
        authorities.
    27. The appellant has a viable option of returning to Baghdad with  the
        available documents from which he can fly internally to  Erbil  and
        be reunited with his family if he cannot fly directly to  the  IKR.
        In relation to return to Baghdad, the  Judge  deals  with  what  is
        described as a limited period of time  until  he  can  re-join  his
        family. The appellant asserts in his grounds that the Judge  failed
        to consider the reasonableness of relocating but this is  an  issue
        raised in the Reasons for Refusal letter placing  the  burden  upon
        the  appellant  to  establish  that  the  proposed  option  is  not
        reasonable.
    28. The appellant claimed he had worked as a police officer in Iraq but
        now, as Mr Mills identified, seems to be claiming that he cannot be
        expected to find work.  As  a  healthy  individual  with  no  known
        impediment to obtaining employment, with necessary language skills,
        and family support, it has not been made  out  that  the  appellant
        will be unable to support himself (directly or with the  assistance
        of others). The Judge does not find the appellant's conditions  are
        sufficient to engage article  3  when  finding  in  [23]  that  the
        appellant would not become  destitute  or  suffer  any  significant
        hardship and any that he suffered would be short lived. It  is  not
        disputed that it may be difficult for the appellant  to  return  to
        Baghdad and that matters may be hard or difficult for him  if  thie
        option was necessary. That is not however the correct test.  It  is
        not made out that even if the appellant does find things  difficult
        whilst he re-establishes himself that  threshold  of  any  problems
        experienced will cross the high threshold of Article 3.
    29. Considering the decision in the round, it has not been made out the
        Judge has made arguable legal error material  to  the  decision  to
        dismiss the appeal for the  reasons  set  out  in  the  grounds  of
        challenge, oral submissions, and the material made available to the
        Tribunals.
