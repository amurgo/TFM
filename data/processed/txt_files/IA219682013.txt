                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant, a citizen of Belarus born on 21 December  1966,  appeals
    against a decision of the Secretary of State made on  22  May  2013  to
    refuse her leave to remain as the spouse of Mr  I  V  H  whom  she  had
    married on 12 February 2012.  I V H, also a  Belarusian  national,  had
    been granted refugee  status  in  Britain  and  has  now  been  granted
    indefinite leave to remain.  The appellant and  her  husband  had  been
    married in Belarus but had divorced there  in  April  1999  before  the
    appellant's husband sought asylum in Britain.  They have a daughter, K,
    who had come to Britain in July 2010 as a dependant of her  father  and
    as the family member of a refugee.  She is studying  part-time  at  the
    University of London and is in her third year of a  four  year  course.
    She also works part-time here.

2.   The appellant first married her husband in August 1988.  K was born  on
    11 December 1990.  I V H later became a member of the Belarus  National
    People Party and in  2003  was  arrested  during  a  demonstration  and
    sentenced to three years in prison.  He had been  released  in  October
    2004 but the appellant's claim was that he  and  she  were  continually
    being harassed thereafter.  Her husband had fled Belarus in  2007.   In
    her witness statement the appellant had stated that  the  marriage  had
    broken down because of her husband's social habits and they had  become
    emotionally apart although they continued to live together  and  indeed
    did so after they had been divorced in August 1999.  In  recording  the
    appellant's evidence in his determination Judge Grant stated  that  she
    had said that:

         "They  divorced  for  her  protection  although  the  disagreements
         contributed to the breakdown of their marriage.  She did not travel
         to the UK with her husband because he was seeking  asylum  and  her
         parents and her daughter still lived in Belarus so  she  could  not
         leave them behind."

3.   The appellant had also stated in  evidence  that  she  had  suffered  a
    nervous breakdown following the deaths of her  parents  in  2011.   Her
    evidence was that her relationship with her husband  had  continued  on
    the basis of friendship notwithstanding the divorce.

4.   The appellant came to Britain as a family visitor on  11  October  2011
    and it was her evidence that thereafter she  and  her  husband  decided
    that they should remarry.  She had always lived with  her  husband  and
    daughter here.

5.   Her application for leave to remain as a  spouse  was  refused  because
    the appellant was in Britain as a visitor and that her daughter was not
    under the age of 18.  She therefore did not qualify under  the  "parent
    route" nor was it accepted that her private life under Article 8 of the
    ECHR would be infringed by the decision.

6.   The grounds of appeal in the First-tier  argued  that  the  appellant's
    rights under Article 8 of the ECHR would be infringed  by  her  removal
    asserting that  the  respondent  had  not  considered  the  appellant's
    Article 8 rights under the "old" Article 8 provisions.

7.   Judge Warren Grant considered the appeal and found that  the  appellant
    did not enjoy private and family life with her husband "over and  above
    that which subsisted in Minsk" which he had found to be  quite  minimal
    and that their Registry Office marriage was "a mere  piece  of  paper".
    He therefore found that Article 8 was not engaged.

8.   When the appeal came before me I found that there were material  errors
    of law in the determination of Judge Warren  Grant,  particularly  with
    regard to whether or not the marriage was, in effect,  subsisting.   At
    the hearing I gave an oral  judgment  which  is  at  Annex  1  of  this
    determination.  I indicated that  given  that  the  appellant  and  her
    husband were living together and were married it was difficult  to  see
    how  the  judge  could  have  concluded  that  the  marriage  was   not
    subsisting.  I made it clear moreover that it would be of use if before
    the  further  hearing  there  was  evidence  to  show  that  the  other
    requirements  of  the  Rules  -   those   regarding   subsistence   and
    accommodation - were met.

9.   At the hearing of the appeal before me  the  appellant  relied  on  her
    witness statement and in answer to questions from Mr  Tufan  said  that
    she had initially intended a visit when she had arrived.  She  accepted
    that having arrived in 2011 she had returned  to  Belarus  for  medical
    treatment before returning to Britain and stated that it was only  when
    she returned to Britain that she and her husband  decided  to  remarry.
    She said that she had thought there was no reason to return to make  an
    application.  She said that she would not want  to  separate  from  her
    family now although she did not fear persecution.  She  confirmed  that
    she was living with her husband and daughter.  She gave some details of
    her husband's work.

10.  The appellant's husband gave evidence regarding his  own  business  and
    confirmed that he was living with the appellant.  Their  daughter  then
    gave similar evidence that she was living with both her parents here.

11.  In summary Mr  Tufan  stated  that  it  was  beyond  dispute  that  the
    appellant could not benefit from the Rules and that that really was the
    only issue that was engaged.  He said that he was not  going  to  argue
    that this was not a genuine marriage given that the appellant  and  her
    husband were married and living together.  He did comment on  the  lack
    of evidence of taxes being paid by the appellant's husband and asked me
    to note that the appellant's husband had  only  been  recently  granted
    indefinite leave to remain. He stated that although he considered  that
    Mr Dutton would rely  on  the  judgment  of  the  Court  of  Appeal  in
    Chikwamba that was no longer relevant given that the new Rules applied.
     He emphasised that there were no minor children involved.   He  stated
    that it was not disproportionate to expect the appellant to  apply  for
    entry clearance.  He also stated  that  of  course  the  appellant  had
    Section 3C leave and therefore she would not be prevented from making a
    further application abroad.

12.  Mr Dutton emphasised that it had been accepted that there was a  family
    life between the appellant and her husband and indeed her daughter  and
    went on to state that there was  evidence  that  the  appellant  would,
    aside from the issue of her having entered as a visitor, meet  all  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules and that there was  a  subsisting
    marriage and that there was  adequate  maintenance  and  accommodation.
    Article 8 was moreover, he argued, engaged and on this he  referred  to
    his  skeleton   argument   asserting   that   there   were   compelling
    circumstances as to why  the  appellant  should  be  granted  leave  to
    remain.  He emphasised that private and family life was a composite and
    moreover it was important to note not only the infringement  of  family
    life but the importance of the potential to develop  that  family  life
    for a married couple.  He asked  me  to  take  into  account  that  the
    appellant's  husband  was  a  post-flight  refugee   relying   on   the
    determination of Sedley LJ in FH (Post-flight spouses) Iran [2010] UKUT
    275 (IAC).  This was a family which could not live together abroad.

13.  His detailed skeleton argument argued that this was a  compelling  case
    in that the appellant was estranged  from  her  brother  who  lived  in
    Belarus, her mother had died in 2009 and her father  in  December  2010
    and the appellant has no other relatives in Belarus.  Her  husband  had
    fled Belarus in 2009 without the appellant and had  then  been  granted
    asylum in Britain.  She was supported financially by  her  husband  and
    had undertaken courses in English.  Her husband  had  set  up  his  own
    business in January 2014 and her daughter was studying  here.   In  the
    skeleton argument he referred to  the  composite  right  in  Article  8
    referring to the determination in MM [2007] UKAIT 40  and  other  cases
    such as Beoku-Betts [2008] UKHL 39.  With regards to  Article  8  under
    the "new" regime he stated that it was clear that if an application did
    not succeed under the Rules it should  be  refused  unless  there  were
    exceptional circumstances which mean that refusal  of  the  application
    would result in unjustifiably harsh consequences for the individual  or
    their family such that refusal would not be proportionate under Article
    8 and argued that such factors existed. He referred to  the  cumulative
    effect of private and family life, the development of that family life,
    that removal of the appellant would affect and disrupt the family  life
    of both her husband and her daughter and that  no  provision  had  been
    made under the Rules for granting leave to the spouse of a refugee when
    the marriage took place after the  refugee  had  left  his  country  of
    origin.

Discussion

14.  I consider it important to set out my findings of  fact  in  this  case
    before considering the issue of  the  rights  of  the  appellant  under
    Article 8 of the ECHR.  I consider that it is  clear  that  this  is  a
    genuine and subsisting marriage.  The appellant her  daughter  and  her
    husband are living together in Brittan.

15.  There were a number of factors which affected the relationship  between
    the  sponsor  and  the  appellant  before  the  sponsor  left  Belarus.
    Principally, it was his personal conduct which led to the  divorce  but
    thereafter the reality is that the couple continued to  live  together,
    albeit living separate lives but that the political involvement of  the
    sponsor led to the appellant herself being harassed.   Given  that  the
    sponsor was granted refugee status here I consider  that  it  is  clear
    that he did suffer such harassment - that has been acknowledged by  the
    grant of status.  However, the reality is that and she and her  husband
    have remarried.

15.  I have seen the tenancy agreement and note the evidence of the  parties
    and accept that there is suitable accommodation for the appellant where
    she is living with her husband and daughter.

16.  I also consider that there are ample funds within the criteria set  out
    in Appendix FM to show that the appellant  will  not  be  a  burden  on
    public funds and indeed the capital sum available to her husband  meets
    the requirements in that regard of the Rules - I note the terms of  the
    letter of 20 August 2014 which stated that the sponsor had, at Barclays
    Bank, a current account the balance of which  on  20  August  2014  was
    �63,513 and that he also had a savings account whose  balance  on  that
    date was in excess of �85,000.

17.  However, the appellant cannot  succeed  under  the  Rules  because  she
    entered Britain as a visitor.

18.  I consider, taking into account the financial  evidence,  the  evidence
    of accommodation and the fact that the marriage is subsisting, that the
    appellant would be able to make a successful application for entry as a
    spouse from her own country which is, indeed, a country  to  which  she
    travelled in 2011.  There is clearly sufficient money  for  her  to  be
    able to live there pending the issue of the visa.  However,  there  are
    factors in this case which are exceptional. The principal one of  which
    is that the sponsor, who was granted refugee status, now has indefinite
    leave to remain but this means that he would not be able to  travel  to
    Belarus with his wife when the application was made.  There is also the
    factor that in the past the appellant had mental health problems  after
    the death of her parents and that she suffered harassment,  because  of
    her husband's activities whilst she was in Belarus. I consider that she
    might well feel vulnerable returning there  for  an  indefinite  period
    while the application was processed.

19.  The question before me is whether or not those  factors  make  this  an
    exceptional case which means that she should be granted leave to remain
    on Article 8 grounds.

20.  I take into account the fact that she meets  the  requirements  of  the
    Rules and that I consider that her stay in Belarus might only be for  a
    limited period although there is no evidence whatsoever  before  me  to
    indicate that that is the case.  However, on balance, I find  that  the
    exceptional factors which I have set  out  above  do,  just,  weigh  in
    favour of my concluding that the appellant's appeal should  be  allowed
    under Article 8.

21.  I therefore, having set aside the decision of the Judge of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal, remake the decision  and  allow  this  appeal  on  human
    rights grounds.
