                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Secretary of State appeals to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Bart-Stewart sitting at Royal  Courts
    of Justice on 17 September 2014) allowing the claimant's appeal against
    the decision of the Secretary of State  to  make  a  deportation  order
    against him by virtue of Section 32(5) of the UK Borders Act 2007.  The
    First-tier Tribunal did not make an anonymity direction, and we do  not
    consider that the claimant or his child (whose name and the name of his
    primary carer we have  anonymised  in  this  decision)  require  to  be
    accorded the protection of an anonymity direction for these proceedings
    in the Upper Tribunal.

The Reasons for Granting Permission

 2. On  13  March  2015  Deputy  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  McWilliam  granted
    permission to appeal for the following reasons:

         (1)  The [claimant] is a citizen of Jamaica and he appealed against
             the decision of the [SSHD] to make a deportation  order.   His
             appeal was allowed by FtTJ Bart-Stewart.  The  [claimant]  was
             sentenced to twenty  months  for  possession  with  intent  to
             supply a class A drug.

         (2)  The grounds are arguable.  It is arguable that the  judge  did
             not give  adequate  reasons  for  finding  in  favour  of  the
             [claimant] in respect of  Section  117(5)  [this  should  read
             Section 117B(v)].  In any  event,  it  is  arguable  that  she
             applied the wrong test.  It  is  arguable  that  she  did  not
             attach sufficient weight to the public interest.  It  is  also
             arguable that inadequate reasons were given for  finding  that
             there would  be  significant  obstacles  to  the  [claimant's]
             integration into Jamaica.

The Claimant's Material History

 3. The claimant, who was born on 19 June 1988, came to the United  Kingdom
    as a visitor on 14 November 1999 aged 11.  He did not leave the  UK  on
    the expiry of his visit visa.  On 10 June 2003, when aged nearly 15, he
    was granted indefinite leave to remain as a  dependant  of  his  mother
    under the "seven year child concession".  On 21 November 2013, aged 25,
    he was convicted and sentenced to twenty months'  imprisonment  and  an
    ASBO preventing him from entering the London  Borough  of  Enfield  for
    three years, save to visit his son and girlfriend.  The conviction  was
    for the supply of a class A drug.

The Judge's Sentencing Remarks

 4. In his sentencing remarks, Judge Lyons accepted that the  claimant  was
    in a category of a street runner, and that gave him a starting point of
    three years.  The judge continued:

         "When deciding what sentence is actually appropriate in this  case,
         a number of factors come into play; firstly, most  importantly,  is
         the immediate plea of guilty; secondly, is the record  which  shows
         that although you have cannabis, you have had no dealing whatsoever
         with class A drugs before.  For a 25 year old  coming  before  this
         court, you are, indeed, lightly convicted in comparison  with  many
         others who come here.  I take into account  the  remorse  that  has
         been expressed on your behalf.

         It is not necessary for this court to  expand  on  the  dangers  to
         society and individuals to class A drugs; that is reflected in  the
         various guidelines and starting points for the  offences.   Looking
         at your particular offending, there were two offences and two types
         of drug.  Nevertheless, the quantity of that drug  was  quite  low,
         being, in total, less than one gram.

          The Crown are concerned, in all the many cases with which  I  will
         be dealing as a result of this operation, about gangs being  funded
         by street dealing.  They are concerned that all who are  caught  in
         that  operation,  if  they  do  not  have  direct  links  with  the
         predominant gang in that area - the 'Get-Money' Gang - could not be
         dealing there without, at the very least, acquiescence on behalf of
         that gang, were it  otherwise,  it  would  be  an  extremely  risky
         activity to undertake.

         I do not, in this case,  make  any  suggestion  of  association  or
         membership an aggravating feature; that will appear in other cases.
          Where it comes into play has been pointed out by  Mr  Potter;  the
         courts have wide powers with ASBOs; they are  often  exercised  too
         widely; they are an interference with the liberty  of  the  subject
         and must be used  sparingly.   I  have  no  doubt  whatsoever  that
         hampering (a) drug dealing and (b) any association  or  activities,
         however loosely connected with gangs which are a blight on Enfield,
         makes an ASBO necessary...

         Resorting to the sentencing matter; the  starting  point  of  three
         years, I think the full  three  years  not  wholly  necessary,  and
         looking at it and applying all the factors  I  have  spoken  about,
         including a plea of guilty, the age, the number  of  offences,  and
         the number of drugs, the previous character and the weight, I  come
         to a sentence of twenty months' imprisonment, that is on  count  1;
         twenty months on count 2; they are to run  concurrently  -  at  the
         same time.  I pass an ASBO of duration, in your case  three  years,
         and it is you must not have in your possession any mobile phone  or
         SIM card which is other than registered to you.  You must not enter
         the London Borough of Enfield save for visiting -  and  there  will
         have to be a name put on it; you do not need  to  do  it  now,  the
         details can be done later - name - girlfriend, name - child, and is
         not to be at large in Enfield unless in their company -  unless  in
         the company of either of them."

The PNC Record and Police Intelligence

 5. The claimant's PNC record shows that on 27 April 2009 he was  convicted
    at Wood Green Crown Court of possessing a knife/sharp  pointed  article
    in a public place on 2 October 2007, and was sentenced to  a  community
    order and a curfew requirement of four months; on 5 April 2009  he  was
    cautioned by Thames Valley Police for possessing a controlled  class  B
    drug; and on 23 June 2011 he was  convicted  at  Uxbridge  Magistrates'
    Court of possessing a controlled class B drug (cannabis/cannabis resin)
    on 2 June 2011 for which he received a fine of �60.

 6. In a witness statement dated 18 March 2014, PC  Finnigan  said  he  had
    interrogated the police intelligence  systems  so  as  to  provide  the
    following information from that research regarding the  claimant.   The
    police ran a covert operation on Enfield  Borough  targeting  the  Get-
    Money Gang ("GMG").  The operation started in June 2013 and lasted  for
    four months, ending in September 2013.  The reason  why  the  operation
    was initiated was to tackle the escalation in gang and violent crime in
    Enfield, specifically targeting  the  GMG  in  order  to  combat  their
    funding through drug dealing.  As  a  result  of  this  operation,  the
    claimant was identified as supplying class  A  drugs  and  subsequently
    arrested and convicted of that offence.  He was part  of  an  operation
    that brought convictions relating to eighteen named  gang  members  who
    all received custodial sentences.  As well as the  claimant  being  the
    subject of a gang ASBO, he was named as  an  associate  on  four  other
    ASBOs of high ranking GMG gang members.  As well as being known to deal
    in drugs on numerous occasions, the claimant also had  warning  markers
    on his police record  due  to  him  carrying  knives,  consistent  with
    practices that gang nominals were involved with.  His association  with
    gang members was he believed clear and  his  involvement  in  the  drug
    dealing in that area suggests that his involvement was very active.

The NOMS Report

 7. An OASys assessment was completed on 21 March 2014.  The  claimant  was
    assessed as posing a medium risk of serious harm to the public in  that
    he had supplied class A drugs to  those  vulnerable  to  drug  use  and
    addictions.  The author of the NOMS Report said he had  no  information
    about  the  circumstances  surrounding  the  index  offence,   or   the
    claimant's previous convictions.  He added  that  the  claimant's  ROSH
    could be reassessed on release.  His risk of  reconviction  within  one
    year was assessed as 29%, and within two years  as  46%,  on  the  OGRS
    predictor.  These scores placed the claimant into the category of a low
    risk reoffender.

The Claimant's Case

 8. The deportation order was signed against the claimant on 9  July  2014,
    and he appealed against  the  decision  to  make  a  deportation  order
    against him on the ground that he came within Exception 1 under Section
    33(2) of the 2007  Act.   Initially  he  indicated  that  he  might  be
    pursuing an asylum claim, but this was withdrawn.

 9. His case before the First-tier Tribunal was that the deportation  order
    would breach his rights under Article 8 ECHR. As at  the  date  of  the
    hearing in the First-tier Tribunal, the claimant had a child  aged  two
    by F, a Swedish national who had first entered the country in 2009.  He
    had never lived with F.  They were allegedly  secretly  engaged  to  be
    married.  He had a paternal grandmother, siblings and his mother in the
    UK.  His father had died when he was aged seven.

The Case for the Secretary of State

10. The case for the Secretary of State, set out in a decision letter dated
    9 July 2014, was that the claimant did not  satisfy  all  the  criteria
    contained within paragraph  399(a)  of  the  Rules  in  order  for  his
    parental relationship with his child to outweigh the public interest in
    his deportation.  He was in a genuine and subsisting relationship  with
    his child A and it would be unreasonable to expect child A to leave the
    UK.  But it was not accepted that child A  was  British,  or  had  been
    living in the UK continuously for  at  least  seven  years  immediately
    preceding the date of the immigration decision, and it  was  considered
    there was another family member who was  able  to  care  for  child  A.
    Child A was currently cared for by  his  mother,  which  had  been  the
    arrangement since his birth.  The appellant had stated in  response  to
    the notice of liability to automatic deportation letter that he was not
    living with child A prior to his imprisonment, although he said he  was
    at the family home most of the time.  He had failed to submit  evidence
    that he provided financial support for child A.  His  mother  had  been
    his primary carer, and had thus been able to support and  maintain  his
    development and wellbeing without  any  support  or  intervention.   He
    would not live as a functioning family unit with child A if he remained
    in the UK, as the ASBO prevented him from living with child A  and  his
    mother in Enfield.  He had put child A at  risk  of  being  exposed  to
    drugs, which could have resulted in serious consequences.  So it was in
    the best interests for child A to remain in the UK with his mother.

11. The claimant also did not satisfy  all  the  criteria  under  paragraph
    399(b) of the Rules which had to be  satisfied  before  a  genuine  and
    subsisting relationship with a spouse or partner outweighed the  public
    interest in his deportation.  It was accepted that he was in a  genuine
    and subsisting relationship with F, and that she was settled in the UK.
     But he had not been living in the UK with valid leave continuously for
    at  least  fifteen  years  immediately  preceding  the  date   of   the
    immigration decision (discounting any  periods  of  imprisonment),  and
    there were not insurmountable obstacles to family  life  with  F  being
    able to continue outside the UK.

The Findings of the First-tier Tribunal Judge

12. The First-tier Tribunal Judge correctly states in paragraph  [30]  that
    the appeal is to be  determined  in  accordance  with  paragraphs  398,
    399(a) and (399d) and 399A of the Immigration Rules  and  that  she  is
    also required to have regard to "s117 of  the  new  Act  introduced  to
    amend Part 12 of the 2002 Act".  By this we assume she means Section 19
    Immigration Act 2014 which amended  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002 by the insertion of Sections 117A - D in Part 5.

13. The judge comments that the child is in fact a British  Citizen  having
    been born to the claimant who had indefinite leave  to  remain  at  the
    time.  In paragraph [32] she draws the  distinction  between  a  person
    sentenced to more than four years and a  person  sentenced  to  between
    twelve months and  four  years.   In  paragraph  [33]  she  finds  that
    paragraph 399(a) applies because the child is  a  British  citizen  and
    that the issue is whether it is "unreasonable to expect  him  to  leave
    the UK and if there is another family member who is able  to  care  for
    him".  However she goes on to find:

         "35. ...Having seen and heard the witness, I do not consider it  at
             all likely that the appellant's girlfriend would follow him to
             Jamaica.  There would  be  a  separation  possibly  permanent,
             between the appellant and his son.  I find  it  would  not  be
             reasonable to expect a young child to leave a mother  who  has
             cared for him since his birth and consequently find  it  would
             not be reasonable to expect the child  to  leave  the  UK  and
             therefore the criteria of paragraph 399(a) is not met.

         36.  ...I accept the appellant  is  in  a  genuine  and  subsisting
             relationship with a partner who is settled in the UK ...  [H]e
             has only had valid leave for ten and a half years prior to the
             date  of  the  immigration  decision.   The   appellant   must
             therefore show that  there  are  insurmountable  obstacles  to
             family life with his partner continuing outside the UK.

         37.  ...I consider that there are no  insurmountable  obstacles  to
             family life with [F] continuing  outside  of  the  UK  by  her
             accompanying the appellant to Jamaica.   It  is  a  matter  of
             choice.  Their child is at an age where he  does  not  have  a
             private life independent of his parents and would be  able  to
             settle wherever his parents decide to settle and  I  therefore
             find that this would not be a factor in concluding that  there
             are insurmountable obstacles to family life continuing outside
             the UK.

         38.  In respect of the new Rules and Section 117 I consider whether
             it would be unduly harsh for the appellant to be deported.   I
             first have regard to the offence and sentence...

         39.  Supplying drugs of any kind and  any  quantity  is  a  serious
             offence.  His claim that he did so having been approached by a
             stranger suggests a distinct lack of judgement and  the  claim
             that it is to the appellant that the family would  go  to  for
             advice.  However I note that the sentence was well  below  the
             starting point of 3 years which reflects the judge's  view  of
             severity.

         40.  ...[T]he risk of serious harm level as  medium.   Amongst  the
             matters taken into account for the assessment in his favour he
             said that the appellant would be returning  to  a  country  he
             does not know.  He has no family or  friends  in  Jamaica.  He
             only has two GCSEs and had not left the UK since 2011. He  had
             no previous Class A drug conviction and whilst in  prison  had
             completed courses  to  turn  his  life  around.   He  is  also
             unusually close to his son.

         41.  ...

         42.  I find that exception 1 does apply. The appellant has lawfully
             resided in the United Kingdom for most of his life.  I  accept
             the evidence with regards to his family...I  accept  that  the
             appellant is socially and culturally integrated in the  United
             Kingdom.  Whilst it appears that he does have  some  relatives
             in Jamaica...I accept his claim that he personally is  not  in
             contact  with  them...I  accept  that  there  would  be   some
             difficulties in the appellant integrating into the country  to
             which it is proposed he be deported.

         43.  I find that exception 2 applies in respect of the  appellant's
             relationship with his son  who  is  a  qualifying  child...For
             reasons I have already given I  do  not  consider  it  at  all
             likely that if the appellant were deported [F] would accompany
             him...

         44.  ...

         45.  The starting  point  is  the  view  taken  by  the  sentencing
             judge....I have also taken account of  the  situation  at  the
             date of  hearing  with  full  account  of  developments  since
             sentence was passed.....

         46.  Very serious reasons are required to justify expulsion  and  I
             have regard  to  the  risk  of  reconviction  which  has  been
             reported as low.  I find that the threshold for expulsion  has
             not been reached in balancing the public interest against  the
             Article 8 family and private life of the appellant, his  child
             and partner."

Reasons for Finding an Error of Law

14. It is well established that the  current  legislation  and  Immigration
    Rules reflect and incorporate the considerations required in an  appeal
    on  Article  8  grounds  and  in  particular  the  assessment  of   the
    proportionality of deportation.

Errors within the Grounds

15. It is unfortunate that although the First-tier Tribunal Judge sets  out
    Section 117C Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002  (the  2002
    Act) and refers to paragraphs 398(b), 399, 399A  she  has  not  applied
    them to her findings of fact.

16. Firstly, the starting point is not the sentencing remarks of the  judge
    but the clearly stated will of Parliament that deportation  of  foreign
    criminals is in the public interest.  For  a  person  convicted  of  an
    offence and sentenced to more than twelve months  but  less  than  four
    years, deportation is  the  proper  course  of  action  (see  paragraph
    398(b)) unless paragraphs 399 or 399A applies.  If  neither  does  then
    the public interest in deportation will only  be  outweighed  by  other
    factors where there are very compelling circumstances  over  and  above
    those described in paragraphs 399 and 399A.

17. The judge found that Exception 1 applied i.e. Section  117C(4)  of  the
    2002 Act.  She refers to his  personal  circumstances  in  the  UK  and
    concludes that "there would  be  some  difficulties  in  the  appellant
    integrating into [Jamaica]".  She has not applied the true construction
    of Exception 1 which requires a  finding  that  there  would  be  "very
    significant obstacles".  The  judge  has  not  made  findings  of  fact
    consistent with a finding that Exception 1 applies.

18. The judge also finds that Exception 2 i.e. Section 117C(5) applies  but
    other than stating that this deportation  would  result  in  the  child
    growing up without his father she has not made a finding of fact either
    specifically or such as  can  be  inferred,  that  the  effect  of  the
    claimant's deportation on the child would be unduly harsh.   Again  she
    has failed to make the reasoned finding that is required  to  enable  a
    conclusion that Exception 2 applies.

19. The judge then goes on to consider the evidence as a whole in the light
    of her findings of fact, incorrectly as referred to above,  taking  the
    starting point as the judge's sentencing remarks.  It appears that this
    may be part of her consideration as to whether Exception 1 applies  and
    may also be an attempt to reflect Section 117C(2) which  sets  out  the
    obvious assertion that the  more  serious  the  offence  committed  the
    greater is the public interest in deportation.

20. It is plain from these remarks that we are satisfied  that  the  First-
    tier Tribunal judge erred in law:

    (a)  in failing to make findings of fact consistent with her conclusion
         that Exception 1 applied;

    (b)  in that  her  finding  that  there  were  "some  difficulties"  in
         integration did  not  and  could  not  result  in  a  finding  that
         Exception 1 applied;

    (c)  in failing to make any findings as to the  child  which  could  be
         said to result in or infer that it would be unduly  harsh  for  the
         child to remain in the UK without the claimant;

    (d)  in failing to weigh the public interest in deportation as  decreed
         by the clear will of Parliament but rather  took  as  her  starting
         point the judge's sentencing remarks.



Alleged Additional Errors not raised in the Grounds

21. After indicating that we are minded to allow the Secretary  of  State's
    appeal on the above grounds, and  to  re-make  the  decision  ourselves
    without hearing any further evidence, Mr Tufan  raised  two  additional
    criticisms which had not been ventilated in the grounds of appeal.   We
    did not accept what appears to have been an oral  application,  not  on
    notice or in writing, for an amendment to the grounds but for the  sake
    of completeness we comment as follows. The first  additional  criticism
    related to the  following  passage  in  paragraph  27  of  the  judge's
    decision:

         "Whilst [F]  was  giving  evidence  a  person  walked  into  public
         gathering whom I recognised.  I informed the representatives  as  I
         then realised her name is listed as an aunt of  the  claimant.   Mr
         Kotas took instructions and said the  caseworker  objected  on  the
         basis of bias.  The test for determining apparent bias is if a fair
         minded and informed observer, having considered  the  facts,  would
         conclude that there was a  real  possibility  that  the  judge  was
         biased.  I did not consider the fact  I  know  a  relative  of  the
         claimant prevented me from evaluating the  evidence  and  making  a
         just decision."

22. Mr Tufan submitted that the judge  should  have  recused  herself,  and
    that, insofar  as  she  had  found  in  favour  of  the  claimant,  her
    favourable findings were tainted by apparent bias.

23. The leading case on apparent bias  is  Locabail  (UK)  Ltd  v  Bayfield
    Properties Ltd & Another [1999] EWCA Civ 3004.  At paragraph  [21]  the
    court cited with  approval  the  following  observations  made  by  the
    Constitutional Court of South Africa:

         "It follows from the foregoing that the correct  approach  to  this
         application for the recusal of members of this court  is  objective
         and the onus of establishing it  rests  upon  the  applicant.   The
         question is whether a reasonable,  objective  and  informed  person
         would on the correct facts reasonably apprehend that the judge  has
         not or will not bring an impartial mind to bear on the adjudication
         of the case, that is a mind open to persuasion by the evidence  and
         submissions of Counsel.  The  reasonableness  of  the  apprehension
         must be assessed in the light of the oath of office  taken  by  the
         judges to administer justice without  fear  or  favour;  and  their
         ability to carry out that oath by  reason  of  their  training  and
         experience.  It must be assumed that they can disabuse their  minds
         of any irrelevant personal beliefs or predispositions.   They  must
         take into account the fact they have a duty to sit in any  case  in
         which they are not obliged to recuse themselves.  At the same time,
         it  must  never  be  forgotten  that  an  impartial  judge  is  the
         fundamental prerequisite for a fair trial and  a  judicial  officer
         should not hesitate to recuse  herself  or  himself  if  there  are
         reasonable grounds on the part of a litigant for apprehending  that
         the judicial officer, for whatever reasons, was not or will not  be
         impartial."

24.  The  observations  of  the  South  African  Constitutional  Court  are
    condensed in the test for apparent bias subsequently formulated by  the
    House of Lords in Porter v Magill [2002] 2 AC 357 as follows:

         "Whether the fair minded and informed observer,  having  considered
         the facts, would conclude that there was a  real  possibility  that
         the judge was biased."

25. On the topic of disclosure, the court in  Locabail  said  at  paragraph
    [26]:

         "If, appropriate disclosure having been made by the judge, a  party
         raises no objection to the judge hearing or continuing  to  hear  a
         case, that party cannot thereafter complain of the matter disclosed
         as giving rise to a real danger of bias.  It would be unjust to the
         other party and undermine both the reality  in  the  appearance  of
         justice to allow him to do  so.   What  disclosure  is  appropriate
         depends in large measure on the stage that the matter has  reached.
         If, before a hearing has begun, the judge is alerted to some matter
         which might, depending on  the  full  facts,  throw  doubt  on  his
         fitness to sit, the judge should in our view enquire into the  full
         facts,  so  far  as  they  are  ascertainable,  in  order  to  make
         disclosure in the light of them.  But if a judge has embarked on  a
         hearing in ignorance of a matter which emerges during the  hearing,
         it is in our view enough if the judge discloses what he then knows.
          He has no obligation to disclose what he does not know.  Nor is he
         bound to fill any gaps in his knowledge  which,  if  filled,  might
         provide stronger grounds for objection to his hearing or continuing
         to hear the case.  If, of course, he does make further enquiry  and
         learn additional facts not known to him before, then he  must  make
         disclosure  of  those  facts  also.   It  is,  however,   generally
         undesirable that the hearings should be aborted unless the  reality
         or the  appearance  of  justice  requires  that  they  should  (our
         emphasis)."

26. We find that the judge acted appropriately in drawing the attention  of
    the representatives to the fact that  she  realised  that  she  knew  a
    relative of the  claimant.   She  thus  gave  the  representatives  the
    opportunity to make representations as to  whether  she  should  recuse
    herself on that ground.  As stated in paragraph [26] of Locabail it  is
    generally undesirable  that  hearings  should  be  aborted  unless  the
    reality or the appearance of justice requires that  they  should.   The
    judge applied the correct test as to whether there was a real danger of
    bias or perception of bias, and we are not persuaded that  she  reached
    the wrong conclusion in light of the oath of office  taken  by  her  to
    administer justice without fear or favour, and her ability to carry out
    that oath by reason of her training and experience.  It must be assumed
    that she would not allow herself to be unduly influenced in  favour  of
    the claimant on account of knowing an aunt of his, particularly as  the
    aunt was not tendered as a witness.

27. Mr Tufan's other criticism was that the judge had been wrong to proceed
    on the premise that child  A  was  a  British  national,  and  hence  a
    qualifying child for the purposes of Section  117D  of  the  2002  Act.
    Although child A held a Swedish passport, and not apparently a  British
    passport, we consider that he is a British  national  by  operation  of
    law, since his father had ILR at the  date  of  his  birth.   Mr  Tufan
    submitted there were procedural requirements as to proof  of  paternity
    which needed to be observed, where the father is  not  married  to  the
    mother.  While we accept the formalities may not  have  been  observed,
    the claimant's name appears on  child  A's  birth  certificate  as  his
    father, and it is accepted in the deportation letter that the  claimant
    is child A's father; and that at all material times he had ILR.  So  on
    the balance of probabilities child A is  a  qualifying  child  for  the
    purposes of Section 117D of the 2002 Act, and we are not persuaded that
    Judge Bart-Stewart erred in law in treating child  A  as  a  qualifying
    child.

The Re-Making of the Decision

28. There was no request by either representative for  the  hearing  to  be
    adjourned. We did not consider it necessary to remit  this  appeal  for
    further fact-finding evidence.  Although the First-tier Tribunal  heard
    the appeal in September 2014, there has been no application  to  adduce
    further evidence and  no  indication  before  us  as  to  what  further
    evidence could add to the findings  to  enable  us  to  reach  our  own
    conclusions.  There was no challenge to the record of evidence set  out
    by the judge in her determination or to the actual findings drawn  from
    that evidence as opposed to the unreasoned conclusions she reached.  We
    have not disturbed her factual findings on the evidence before her.

29. We heard submissions from both parties. Mr Collins drew  our  attention
    to various passages in the evidence upon which he relied, including the
    claimant's statement at G14 that he had been involved in his son's life
    since he was in his mother's womb.  He had been at  every  appointment,
    and was there throughout the whole pregnancy, and he had been a  hands-
    on father from the day he was born.  He had seen what  F  went  through
    and how good she was with him, so seven months later on Christmas  Day,
    he secretly proposed as he knew he wanted to spend the rest of his life
    with her and to be a proper family.  Every child deserved the right  to
    be brought up by both parents.  His fianc�e was now saying that he  was
    starting to misbehave because everyone he was used to being around  was
    leaving him: he was away, F was  on  a  course,  his  (the  claimant's)
    mother was ill and could not look after him, his older brother was also
    on a course, and his younger brother had his own family.   So  his  son
    did not have the stability he was used to having, and his  fianc�e  was
    now relying on friends.  There have been countless studies showing that
    kids in single parent houses did not do  as  well  as  kids  with  both
    parents, and he  believed  that  his  son  would  suffer  mentally  and
    emotionally if he were to be deported.  His mother  told  him  that  he
    still walked round the house looking for him and it was very stressful,
    as he was used to him being there, brushing his teeth, putting  him  to
    bed, playing with him and just being around.

30. On behalf of the Secretary of State, Mr Tufan  drew  our  attention  to
    various passages in Chapter  13  of  the  IDIs,  entitled  "Criminality
    Guidance in Article 8 ECHR cases" (Version 5.0 dated 28 July 2014).

Discussion and Findings on Re-Making

31. We are mandated by Parliament to give effect to the new Part 5A of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002.   Part  5A  is  entitled
    "Article 8 of the ECHR: public interest considerations".  Section  117A
    provides:

         '(1) This Part applies where a court or  tribunal  is  required  to
             determine whether a decision made under the Immigration Acts-

             (a)  breaches a person's right  to  respect  for  private  and
                  family life under Article 8, and

             (b)  as a result would be unlawful  under  section  6  of  the
                  Human Rights Act 1998.

         (2)  In considering the public  interest  question,  the  court  or
             tribunal must (in particular) have regard-

             (a)  in all cases, to the  considerations  listed  in  section
                  117B, and

             (b)  in cases concerning the deportation of foreign criminals,
                  to the considerations listed in section 117C.

         (3)  In subsection (2), 'the public interest  question'  means  the
             question of whether an interference with a person's  right  to
             respect for private and family life is justified under Article
             8(2).'

32.  Section  117B  lists  the  following  "Article  8:   public   interest
    considerations applicable in all cases":

         '(1) The maintenance of effective immigration controls  is  in  the
             public interest.

         (2)  It is in  the  public  interest,  and  in  particular  in  the
             interests of the economic well-being of  the  United  Kingdom,
             that persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom
             are able to speak  English,  because  persons  who  can  speak
             English-

             (a)  are less of a burden on taxpayers, and

             (b)  are better able to integrate into society.

         (3)  It is in  the  public  interest,  and  in  particular  in  the
             interests of the economic well-being of  the  United  Kingdom,
             that persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom
             are financially independent, because such persons-

             (a)  are not a burden on taxpayers, and

             (b)  are better able to integrate into society.

         (4)  Little weight should be given to-

             (a)  a private life, or

             (b)  a relationship formed with a qualifying partner,

             that is established by a person at a time when the  person  is
             in the United Kingdom unlawfully.

         (5)  Little weight should be given to a private life established by
             a person at a time when the  person's  immigration  status  is
             precarious.

         (6)  In the case of a person who is not liable to deportation,  the
             public interest does not require the person's removal where-

             (a)   the  person  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting   parental
                  relationship with a qualifying child, and

             (b)  it would not be reasonable to expect the child  to  leave
                  the United Kingdom.'

33. Section 117C sets out  additional  public  interest  considerations  in
    cases involving foreign criminals.  These considerations are:

         '(1)  The  deportation  of  foreign  criminals  is  in  the  public
             interest.

         (2)  The more serious the offence committed by a foreign  criminal,
             the greater is the  public  interest  in  deportation  of  the
             criminal.

         (3)  In the case of  a  foreign  criminal  (C)  who  has  not  been
             sentenced to a period  of  four  years  or  more,  the  public
             interest  requires  C's  deportation  unless  Exception  1  or
             Exception 2 applies.

         (4)  Exception 1 applies where -

             (a)  C has been lawfully resident in the  United  Kingdom  for
                  most of C's life; and

             (b)  C is socially and culturally  integrated  in  the  United
                  Kingdom; and

             (c)   there  would  be  very  significant  obstacles  to   C's
                  integration into the country to which C is proposed to  be
                  deported.

         (5)  Exception 2 applies where  C  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting
             relationship with a  qualifying  partner,  or  a  genuine  and
             subsisting parental relationship with a qualifying child,  and
             the effect of C's deportation on the partner or child would be
             unduly harsh.

         (6)  In the case of a foreign criminal who has been sentenced to  a
             period of imprisonment of at  least  four  years,  the  public
             interest requires deportation unless there are very compelling
             circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions  1
             and 2. '

34. Accordingly, in determining the question  of  whether  the  apprehended
    interference with the right to respect for private and family  life  is
    justified under Article 8(2), we are enjoined to  have  regard  to  the
    considerations specified in Section 117B and Section 117C.

35. Under Section 117B, a consideration in the claimant's favour is that he
    is able to speak English.  On the  debit  side,  the  claimant  is  not
    financially independent, and there is no  evidence  that  he  has  ever
    undertaken any gainful employment, save possibly when he worked  as  an
    apprentice trainee chef. Mr Tufan relied on Paragraph 2.57 of the  IDIs
    which states that if  a  foreign  criminal  cannot  demonstrate  he  is
    financially independent, it will be more difficult for him to show that
    the effect of deportation on his qualifying partner or qualifying child
    will be unduly harsh.

36. Under Section 117C we acknowledge Parliament's unambiguous  declaration
    that deportation of foreign criminals is in the  public  interest,  the
    more so according to the seriousness  of  the  offence  committed.   We
    recognise that the claimant's offending occupies a position of moderate
    gravity in the notional scale of criminality, based on  the  length  of
    the sentence of imprisonment that was imposed. (The  statute  does  not
    distinguish between different types of offence or  the  level  of  harm
    that C thereby poses to the public.) As the sentence falls  within  the
    band of one to four years, the claimant can  potentially  benefit  from
    either Exception 1 or Exception 2.

37. It is convenient to note at this stage that Exception 1  is  reproduced
    verbatim in Paragraph 399A of the deportation rules, as  from  28  July
    2014. Exception 2 is also reflected in the latest version of  Paragraph
    399, but the current deportation rules provide greater  specificity  on
    what needs to be shown in order for  the  proposed  deportation  to  be
    treated as having an unduly harsh impact on partner or child.

Exception 1

38. We find that Exception 1 does not apply as the claimant  has  not  been
    lawfully resident in the United Kingdom for most of his life.  Although
    Judge Bart-Stewart found that he had, her conclusion was  unreasoned  -
    and wrong. At the time he arrived in the UK, he had  resided  for  some
    eleven years in Jamaica.  Judge Bart-Stewart calculated that his period
    of lawful residence in the UK  since  arrival  is  ten  years  and  six
    months.  We infer that this figure was  arrived  at  by  excluding  the
    period from when the claimant's visit visa expired until he was granted
    ILR in line with his mother.  Thereafter,  the  claimant  was  lawfully
    resident until  he  went  to  prison.  The  claimant  is  currently  in
    immigration detention,  and  he  has  apparently  been  in  immigration
    detention since his notional release on licence. The deportation  order
    which was made against him after  his  conviction  had  the  effect  of
    immediately curtailing his ILR. We infer from the  judge's  calculation
    that the claimant was in prison on remand for four months leading up to
    his conviction. This would tally with the claimant  being  arrested  in
    the summer of 2013, in the middle of the police operation  against  the
    GMG. Given the police's perception of him,  it  is  unlikely  that  the
    claimant was released on bail pending his criminal trial.

39. We accept that the claimant is socially and  culturally  integrated  in
    the United Kingdom. But there is insufficient  evidence  to  warrant  a
    finding  that  there  would  be  very  significant  obstacles  to   his
    reintegration into his country of origin.  Although he has not lived in
    Jamaica since the age of 11, he came to this country  with  his  mother
    and other family members have followed or were already here.  So it  is
    likely that the  claimant  continued  to  grow  up  within  a  Jamaican
    diaspora, and thereby he had through family members continued  exposure
    to Jamaican culture and customs.  On the question of his  employability
    on return to Jamaica, Mr Collins submitted that the claimant  had  only
    obtained a few  GCSEs.   But  in  the  deportation  letter,  presumably
    echoing claims made by the claimant in his completed questionnaire,  it
    was said that the claimant had gained a CSCS  card,  a  certificate  in
    health and safety and had gained employment as  an  apprentice  trainee
    chef.  In her evidence  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  the  claimant's
    mother admitted that she had left behind four brothers in Jamaica,  and
    she had attended the wedding of one of them in Jamaica about five years
    ago.  In re-examination, she said that the claimant knew  her  brothers
    when he was younger, but he was not in  contact  with  them  now.   The
    judge accepted this, and we do not disturb her finding. But  while  the
    claimant's family ties in Jamaica are weak ties, they  are  ties  which
    can be revived.   In  Bossadi  (paragraph  276ADE;  suitability;  ties)
    [2015] UKUT 00042 (IAC) the UT held at [15] that the decision-maker  is
    required  to  take  into  account   both   subjective   and   objective
    considerations, "and also to consider what lies within the choice of  a
    claimant to achieve"; and at [16] that such  an  assessment  must  also
    consider, "whether ties that are dormant  can  be  revived."  The  weak
    family ties which the claimant has in Jamaica  "could  be  pursued  and
    strengthened" by him if he chooses: see Balogun v UK [2012] ECHR 614 at
    [51].

40. The reasons given by Judge Bart-Stewart in paragraph [37]  for  finding
    there are not insurmountable obstacles to F living in Jamaica with  the
    claimant are also supportive of the proposition that there are not very
    significant obstacles to the claimant going back on his own.



Exception 2 - Paragraph 339(a) - Whether unduly harsh impact on F

41. We do not find that Exception 2 applies in respect  of  the  claimant's
    relationship with F.  As submitted by Mr Tufan, F is not shown to be  a
    person who is settled in the UK, within the meaning of Section 117D (1)
    and Section 33(2) of the Immigration Act 1971, to which Section 117D(1)
    cross-refers. She is not shown to be ordinarily resident here  "without
    being subject under the immigration laws  to  any  restriction  on  the
    period for which [she] may remain". There has been no attempt  to  show
    that she  has  exercised  treaty  rights  as  an  EEA  national  for  a
    continuous five year period so  as  to  qualify  for  the  issue  of  a
    permanent residence  card.   So  she  is  not  a  "qualifying"  partner
    pursuant to Section 117D(1).

42. We acknowledge that the deportation letter accepted that F was  settled
    in the UK. But the concession was unanalysed, and  while  the  Tribunal
    must accept a factual concession, it should  not  accept  a  concession
    that is  erroneous  in  law.  There  is  no  procedural  unfairness  as
    Exception 2 does not apply for other reasons.

43. The judge's finding at paragraph [37] that there are no  insurmountable
    obstacles to F carrying on family life with  the  claimant  in  Jamaica
    support a finding that  it  would  not  be  unduly  harsh  for  her  to
    accompany the claimant to Jamaica, if that  is  the  choice  which  she
    makes.

44. Another relevant consideration is that F is not a  partner  within  the
    meaning of Appendix FM.  This is because she  is  not  married  to  the
    claimant, and she has also not lived with him in a relationship akin to
    marriage for at least two years.  The finding by the judge at paragraph
    [37] is that prior to his imprisonment the claimant had been  receiving
    jobseeker's allowance for  four  years  and  housing  benefit,  and  no
    attempt was made by him to obtain accommodation "nearer to his  partner
    and child".  The claimant gave evidence  (paragraph  23)  that  at  the
    inception of his relationship with F he was living in Slough,  and  she
    was living in Crawley, an hour and a half away  by  train.   The  judge
    held at paragraph [35] that at the time the claimant  claimed  to  have
    become secretly engaged on Christmas Day 2012, just before  his  arrest
    (which was actually in the summer of 2013 - see  above),  the  claimant
    was living in Slough and his partner F  was  living  in  Crawley.   The
    judge  rejected  the  claimant's  evidence  that  there  was  a  secret
    engagement. Although F moved with child A to Enfield, the claimant  did
    not cohabit with F in Enfield despite operating in Enfield  as  a  drug
    dealer. Hence the claimant admitted in  the  deportation  questionnaire
    that he was not living under the same roof as his F and child A at  the
    time of his arrest. As observed by the judge at paragraph  [37],  there
    was no suggestion that F had made any enquiries about moving out of the
    borough so that they could live together during  the  currency  of  the
    ASBO.   So while the claimant and F are partners in a loose  sense,  it
    is a boyfriend-girlfriend  relationship,  rather  than  a  relationship
    which is akin to marriage.  Hence F is also not a "partner" within  the
    meaning of Section 117D(1).

45. Under Rule 399(b) the unduly harsh question is  broken  down  into  two
    distinct limbs.  It has to be shown it would be unduly  harsh  for  the
    partner to live in the country to which the person is to  be  deported,
    because of compelling circumstances over and above those  described  in
    paragraph EX.2 of Appendix FM; and that it would be  unduly  harsh  for
    that partner to remain in the UK  without  the  person  who  is  to  be
    deported.

46. The claimant's case under Rule 399(b) falls at  the  first  hurdle,  as
    there are not insurmountable obstacles to family life with F continuing
    in Jamaica, within the meaning of Paragraph EX.2 of Appendix FM.  So it
    would not be unduly harsh for F to live in Jamaica with  the  claimant.
    The fact that it is  unlikely  that  F  will  follow  the  claimant  to
    Jamaica, as the judge found at paragraph [35], does not change the fact
    that the first limb of the test is not satisfied.

Exception 2 - Paragraph 399(b) - Whether unduly harsh impact on Child

47. As to paragraph 399(b) of the Rules, it must be shown in respect  of  a
    qualifying child:

      i) it would be unduly harsh for the child to live in  the  country  to
         which the person is to be deported; and

     ii) it would be unduly harsh for the child to remain in the UK  without
         the person who is to be deported.

 1. It would not be unduly harsh for child A to go with both his parents to
    Jamaica at this stage of his life.  Although he is a  British  citizen,
    he is also a Jamaican national and thereby entitled to the benefits  of
    Jamaican citizenship. He is still very young, and with the  support  of
    both parents he would be able to adapt to life in Jamaica, one  of  the
    countries of which he is a national.  Insofar as he is part of a family
    unit comprising his mother and his father, at this stage of his life it
    is more important that this family  unit  be  preserved,  wherever  his
    parents happen to be, than that he  should  continue  to  live  in  the
    country of his birth for the next ten years.

 2. The more likely outcome on the basis of the accepted evidence  is  that
    his mother will not take him to Jamaica. We accept that the removal  of
    his father to Jamaica will be contrary  to  his  best  interests.   The
    level of contact with his father has been very restricted for more than
    half his life (being restricted to visits to see his father  in  prison
    or detention) and his father is not and  never  has  been  his  primary
    carer.  His father has not been part of his home environment since  the
    summer of 2013. The claimant's claim to have put the child  to  bed  as
    frequently as he did before  his  arrest  is  not  credible  given  the
    distance  between  the  two  households  and  the  lack  of  any  other
    corroborative evidence. Also, there is no evidence that there  was  any
    talk between the couple of living together to enable  the  claimant  to
    take an active role in Child A's care more  easily.  The  claimant  has
    never been a source of financial support. Child A  is  likely  to  have
    become used to not having the claimant as a central  father  figure  in
    his life, and although it would be better for  his  development  to  be
    able to continue to have some direct contact with his  father,  we  are
    unable to find it would be unduly harsh for him to  remain  in  the  UK
    without the claimant.

 3. As neither Exception 1 nor Exception 2 applies, the public interest  in
    deportation will only be outweighed by other factors  where  there  are
    very  compelling  circumstances  over  and  above  those  described  in
    paragraphs 399 and 399A or over and above those described in Exceptions
    1 and 2.

Whether Very Compelling Circumstances

 4. The judge found at paragraph [38] that there was  no  evidence  of  the
    claimant having any direct links with gangs, although there had  to  be
    concern that one of the people he described as a friend  with  whom  he
    went out and had drinks had  a  number  of  cautions  for  offences  of
    dishonesty and three convictions  of  possession  of  drugs,  including
    offering to supply a class A drug (cocaine).  At  paragraph  [45],  the
    judge noted that at the beginning of the sentence  of  imprisonment  it
    appeared the claimant was a cannabis user, which he admitted,  but  the
    drug tests carried out in March  2014  when  he  was  transferred  from
    Pentonville Prison were all negative; and that most of  the  references
    in the medical notes were to his back pains caused by him being stabbed
    (in 2007).

 5. The judge appears not to have made the connection  between  the  police
    intelligence of the claimant  being  an  active  gang  member  who  was
    involved in knife crime and the claimant's account of  being  seriously
    wounded in 2007 through being attacked with a knife.  But  assuming  in
    the claimant's favour that he has put his past behind him (as the judge
    does, and we do not disturb her finding in this  regard)  and  reaching
    our conclusions on the basis that he was not an active gang member,  we
    are unable to see any circumstances that have not  already  been  taken
    into account or that amount  to  very  compelling  circumstances  which
    militate against the public interest in the claimant's deportation.

Conclusion

 6. Both by reference to the statute, and by reference to  the  deportation
    Rules, the claimant  has  not  shown  that  his  deportation  would  be
    contrary to the United Kingdom's obligations under  Article  8  of  the
    ECHR.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  contained  an  error  of  law,  and
accordingly the  decision  is  set  aside  and  the  following  decision  is
substituted: the claimant's appeal against deportation  on  Article  8  ECHR
grounds is dismissed.

No anonymity direction is made.
