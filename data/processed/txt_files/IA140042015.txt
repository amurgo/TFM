Representation:
For the appellant:     Mr M Jaufurally, Callistes Solicitors
For the respondent:    Ms Z Ahmad, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Sadiq Ibrahim, date of birth 20.11.90, is a  citizen  of
    Nigeria.

 2. This is his appeal against the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Taylor promulgated 22.4.16, dismissing his appeal against the  decision
    of the Secretary of State, dated 5.1.15, to refuse his application made
    on 27.11.13 for leave to remain as a Tier 4 Student Migrant.  The Judge
    heard the appeal on 18.4.16.

 3. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Colyer  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    14.9.16.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 24.10.16 as an appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. For the reasons summarised below, I found such  error  of  law  in  the
    making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  as  to  require  the
    decision of Judge Taylor to be set aside and  the  decision  remade  by
    dismissing the appeal, but on a limited basis, as explained below.

 6. As the refusal decision makes clear, the appellant  failed  to  provide
    sufficient evidence to meet the maintenance requirements under Appendix
    C of the Immigration Rules. He was required to  show  possession  of  a
    minimum sum of �1,600 for a consecutive 28-day period and that evidence
    had to be submitted with the application. Mr Jaufurally  conceded  that
    requirement cannot now be met.

 7. However, the  application  was  additionally  refused  under  paragraph
    322(1A), on the basis that in his application the appellant  failed  to
    disclose a conviction for theft on  4.12.09.  The  Secretary  of  State
    considered that he had used deception in  the  application,  hence  the
    refusal on that ground  and  reference  to  paragraph  320(7B)  in  the
    refusal decision as to the  consequences  of  such  deception  for  any
    future application.

 8. Whilst 322(1A) refers  to  false  representations  etc.  made  with  or
    without the appellant's knowledge, AA (Nigeria) v SSHD [2010] EWCA  Civ
    773, makes clear that dishonesty must be proved, even if it is not that
    of the appellant.

 9. Ms Ahmad relied on IA (Somalia) [2007] EWCA Civ 323 to the effect  that
    an error is not material if the decision-maker must  have  reached  the
    same conclusion without the error. As the appeal was bound to  fail  on
    the maintenance requirements, she submits that there can be no material
    error of law. However, whilst the decision in the appeal would  be  the
    same,  namely  dismissal,  there  are  very  difference   consequences,
    depending on what basis the appeal is dismissed. If the decision of the
    Secretary of State to dismiss under paragraph 322(1A)  is  upheld,  the
    appellant will find any  future  application  refused  under  paragraph
    320(7B) for a period of time, depending on whether  he  leaves  the  UK
    voluntarily or has to be removed. In those circumstances, an  error  of
    law on the issue on the non-disclosure of the conviction is  very  much
    material, even if the outcome of the appeal remains the same.

10.  Before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  the  appellant  gave  contradictory
    explanations as to why he had not disclosed the  conviction.  He  first
    stated that he had forgotten about it, but later acknowledged  that  he
    had not forgotten but claimed he  assumed  the  respondent  would  know
    about it anyway as the application form said that the Home Office would
    check its records. At �15 the First-tier Tribunal Judge concluded  that
    the appellant's explanation for the omission did "not ring true.  I  do
    not believe he forgot about it or thought  that  it  was  unimportant."
    However,  the  judge  did  not  find  that  the  appellant  had   acted
    dishonestly.

11. Bearing in mind that the burden  lay  on  the  Secretary  of  State  to
    establish dishonesty on the balance of probabilities, the mere  failure
    to disclose the conviction does not discharge that  burden.  The  judge
    made no conclusion as  to  dishonesty  even  though  finding  that  the
    appellant had not forgotten about the conviction. The  judge  does  not
    state that the  second  explanation  proffered  by  the  appellant  was
    untrue, or not credible, or not believed. On those findings,  there  is
    insufficient to discharge the burden of proving dishonesty.

Conclusion:

12. I therefore find that the appellant's appeal must fail, but only on the
    maintenance requirements of Appendix C. I find that  the  Secretary  of
    State has failed to demonstrate that he used dishonesty  when  omitting
    to disclose his criminal conviction and  therefore  he  should  not  be
    subjected to  the  prohibition  of  paragraph  322(7B)  in  any  future
    application. Mr Jaufurally also points out that the appellant  may  now
    benefit from the 28-day grace period to  make  a  new  application  for
    leave to remain as a Tier 4 Student.

Decision

13. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should  be
    set aside.

     I set aside the decision.

                    I re-make the decision in the appeal  by  dismissing  it
                    under the Tier 4 student maintenance requirements of the
                    Immigration Rules.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.




Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed and thus there can be no fee award.
