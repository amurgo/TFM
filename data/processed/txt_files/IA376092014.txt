Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr  M  Aslam,  Counsel  instructed  by  Hartley  Bain
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr S Whitwell, Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal (Judge Rowlands sitting  at  Richmond  Magistrates'
    Court on 8 April 2015) dismissing his appeal against the decision by an
    Immigration Officer to refuse to grant him leave to  enter  the  United
    Kingdom, and to cancel his continuing  leave  as  a  Tier  1  (General)
    Migrant.  The First-tier Tribunal did not make an anonymity  direction,
    and I do not consider  that  the  appellant  requires  to  be  accorded
    anonymity for these proceedings in the Upper Tribunal.

The Grant of Permission to Appeal

 2. On 14 July 2015 First-tier Tribunal Judge Grant-Hutchison  granted  the
    appellant permission to appeal for the following reasons:

         "2.  It is arguable that the Judge has misdirected himself  by  (a)
             not  placing  the  burden  of  proof  on  the  Respondent   in
             allegations  of  false  representations  and  (b)  failing  to
             consider that the amended tax  returns  under  which  a  large
             liability for tax was acknowledged showed that  the  Appellant
             was genuinely liable for that tax which in turn mean  that  he
             genuinely earned the money claimed.

         3.   It is further submitted that the Judge erred in law by failing
             to  address  the  need  to  consider  not  whether  there  are
             exceptional circumstances but whether  there  were  compelling
             circumstances   not   sufficiently   recognised   under    the
             Immigration Rules to address Article 8.  Bearing in  mind  the
             decision of the Upper Tribunal in Ferrer [2012] UKUT 304 (IAC)
             although this ground is weaker I  am  disinclined  to  exclude
             it."

The Relevant Background Facts

 3. The appellant is a national of Ghana, whose date of birth is  8  August
    1974.  He first entered the United Kingdom  on  7  November  2009  with
    valid leave as a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant.

 4. According to the explanatory statement, the appellant's leave  in  this
    capacity ran until 31 January 2012.  According to the appellant, he was
    granted leave to remain as a Tier 1 Migrant  in  2010,  and  the  first
    grant of leave to remain as a Tier 1 Migrant ran until October 2012.

 5. It is however common ground that in August 2012 the  appellant  applied
    for leave to remain as a Tier 1 Migrant, relying  on  claimed  previous
    earnings of �73,687.12 earned during the period 12 August 2011 up to  6
    August 2012.  These earnings were from three sources: (1) earnings from
    employment with Spencer and Arlington of  �23,822,  earned  between  31
    August 2011 and 31 July 2012; (2) earnings from Temp  Exchange  Ltd  of
    �4,875.42 earned between 27 November 2011 and 27 May 2012; and (3) self-
    employment earnings of �53,830 gross, earned between 19 August 2011 and
    15 July 2012.  On the  strength  of  the  evidence  provided  with  the
    application, the appellant was granted leave to  remain  as  a  Tier  1
    Migrant for a three year period running from 12 February 2013 until  12
    February 2016.

 6. As set out in a detailed explanatory  statement  which  was  issued  in
    response to the  appellant's  grounds  of  appeal,  the  appellant  was
    interviewed by Border Force officers on 19 September 2014  at  Heathrow
    Airport, Terminal 4, having flown in from Accra via Amsterdam.  He  was
    questioned about his employment history.  He had  been  employed  on  a
    long-term basis as a support worker with Spencer  and  Arlington  since
    March 2010 with earnings of between �23,000 and �24,000 per annum.   He
    had been self-employed as a business  consultant  from  September  2011
    until April 2012.  He had earned between �60,000 and �65,000 from  this
    self-employment.  It was a consultancy business relating to  the  start
    up of businesses in Ghana.

 7. Following enquiries with local sources available to the United  Kingdom
    Border Force, questions arose concerning the levels of income which the
    appellant had claimed for the purposes of obtaining a Tier 1  (General)
    Migrant residence permit.  Records indicated  that  he  had  registered
    himself  as  self-employed  on   23   August   2011   as   a   business
    consultant/tutor, but he had failed to submit returns to HMRC for which
    a penalty had been levied against him.

 8. At a second interview, the appellant said he  had  travelled  to  Ghana
    with his family as his wife had health problems with her pregnancy  and
    required care.  So she was now with extended family in Ghana with their
    son.  The only employment he currently had was as a support worker with
    people with mental disabilities.  This was his  employment  by  Spencer
    and Arlington.  He was asked why, if he was able to earn  �60,000  from
    self-employment within an eight month period, he was  now  working  for
    only �24,000 per annum.  The appellant said  he  needed  to  make  that
    level of income to keep his status, so he  had  to  venture  into  that
    business.  He used a freelance accountant that  he  had  found  on  the
    internet, and he was unable to recall any tax that had been paid on his
    earnings from self-employment.  He admitted the penalty notice had been
    issued to him by HMRC.  He said it was for  a  sum  of  a  little  over
    �1,000 but he did not need to pay.  This was because  he  contacted  an
    accountant that he had found online, who helped him to waive  the  fine
    as he had ceased self-employment.

 9. The appellant was granted temporary admission until 29  September  2014
    in order to submit further documents.  At an interview on 29  September
    2014, he gave further details about his self-employment, and  confirmed
    that two named clients were his  only  clients.   He  said  he  charged
    between �200 and �400 per hour for his services, and he had started his
    business in September 2011 and had continued his  business  until  July
    2012.  He did not carry on with his business  as  he  had  started  his
    Masters programme.  When asked by the interviewing officer why  he  had
    withdrawn large sums of money soon after payments were  made  into  his
    account, he said that this was a coincidence.

10. On 29 September 2014 a Chief Immigration Officer at Terminal 4 Heathrow
    Airport served the appellant with a  notice  of  refusal  of  leave  to
    enter.  The notice stated as follows:

         "To: Kareem Sule Fuseini

         You were given notice of leave to remain in the United Kingdom as a
         Tier 1 General Migrant on 12/02/13, but I am satisfied  that  false
         representations were employed or material facts were not  disclosed
         for the purpose of obtaining the leave, or there has  been  such  a
         change of circumstances in your case since the  leave  was  granted
         that it should be cancelled.  I therefore  cancel  your  continuing
         leave.  If your leave was conferred by  an  entry  clearance,  this
         will also have the effect of cancelling your entry clearance.

         I have reached this decision with the regard to the fact that  your
         residence permit was issued  to  you  on  the  basis  of  documents
         supporting your application which showed that you had  earnings  of
         �73,687.16 from 01/08/11 to 31/07/12 for which you were awarded  40
         points.  As well as working as a support  worker  for  Spencer  and
         Arlington, you state that you worked as a self-employed  consultant
         providing business advice and providing tour  referrals  to  people
         who  wanted  to  go  to  Ghana.   You  claimed   to   have   earned
         approximately �57,000 per annum.  You were  unable  to  explain  in
         detail what the work involved.  You claimed to have only clients by
         the name of Abdullah Majeed and Tajul Mohammed.

         Contact was made with  Mr  Abdullah  Majeed  who  stated  that  you
         provided him with building and housing advice, but was  very  vague
         and could not clearly explain what work you carried  out  for  him.
         Mr Majeed could not recall how much money he had paid you for  your
         services, but believed it was  around  �10,000.   Several  attempts
         were made to  contact  Mr  Tajul  Mohammed  but  the  phone  number
         provided was not a valid number.  You also  stated  that  Mr  Tajul
         Mohammed was currently in Ghana.

         Your bank statements show payments  made  from  Mr  Majeed  and  Mr
         Mohammed, but  your  account  also  shows  large  amounts  of  cash
         withdrawals within a couple of days after the money  was  deposited
         by your clients.

         Our records also show that you have not paid any tax on your  self-
         employment earnings.  You stated that your accountant  Gordon  Addo
         made an error.  Several attempts were made to contact Mr  Addo  but
         there was no response.

         For the reasons above, I  am  satisfied  that  our  self-employment
         earnings were inflated in order to obtain your residence permit.

         You have  not  sought  entry  under  any  other  provision  of  the
         immigration rules.

         I  therefore  refuse  you  leave  to  enter  the  United  Kingdom/I
         therefore  cancel  your  continuing  leave.   If  your  leave   was
         conferred by an entry clearance, this will also have the effect  of
         cancelling your entry clearance.  The cancellation  of  your  leave
         will be treated for the purposes of the Immigration  Act  1971  and
         the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 as  a  refusal  of
         leave to enter at a time when you were in possession of  a  current
         entry clearance."

The Hearing before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

11. At the hearing in the First-tier  Tribunal,  the  appellant  gave  oral
    evidence and relied on the documents which  had  been  assembled  in  a
    bundle by his solicitors.

12. The bundle of documents included a letter dated  13  August  2012  from
    Gordon Addo and Associates addressed  to  the  UK  Border  Agency.   As
    accountants for the appellant, they could confirm  his  self-employment
    income for the accounting period ended 31 July 2012.  His gross  income
    from self-employment was �53,830.  After deduction of expenses, his net
    income from self-employment was �44,989.

13. At page 74 of the bundle was a revised tax calculation for the tax year
    ended 5 April 2012.  It is apparent from the table that the profit from
    self-employment previously declared to HMRC, and thus assessed by them,
    was zero for the year to 5 April 2012.  What was now being declared was
    a profit from self-employment in the  relevant  tax  year  of  �29,993.
    Accordingly, whereas the appellant  had  previously  been  assessed  as
    having a total income on which tax  was  due  of  �9,577,  he  was  now
    declaring a total income on which tax was due of �51,040.   This  meant
    that the income tax due for the tax year had risen  from  �1,950.40  to
    �13,416 (a difference of �11,500).

14. In the witness statement, which he adopted  as  his  evidence-in-chief,
    the appellant said that the cancellation of his  continuing  leave  had
    raised concerns in his mind with regards to the accuracy of the returns
    that had been submitted by his previous accountant.   So  he  presented
    the information to a different accountant who  saw  the  documents  and
    advised that the tax  returns  should  be  amended  as  they  were  not
    entirely accurate.  With regards to the Border Force not being able  to
    make contact with Mr Addo, he  could  not  comment  on  that.   He  had
    approached Mr Addo to enquire about the same, and Mr  Addo  had  simply
    told him that he had not received any calls from the Home Office.

15. As is apparent from paragraphs [5] to [9]  of  the  judge's  subsequent
    decision, the appellant was cross-examined on his evidence.  He said he
    did not think that there was anything odd about him not having paid any
    tax at all on his self-employed earnings because  the  accountant  said
    that the tax could be carried over.

16. The judge's reasons for finding against the appellant were set  out  in
    paragraphs [12] to [21] of his subsequent  decision,  and  I  reproduce
    these paragraphs below:

         "12. This is an appeal under the provisions of Section 82(1) of the
             Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002,  which  states
             that where an immigration decision is made  in  respect  of  a
             person he may appeal to an immigration  judge.   The  onus  of
             showing that he can comply with  the  Immigration  Rules  lies
             with  the  Appellant.   He  must  do  so  on  the  balance  of
             probabilities.  As far as any breach of his human  rights  are
             concerned it is for him to show that  there  is  a  reasonable
             likelihood that there would be a breach if he were removed  or
             not allowed entry clearance.

         13.  The Appellant has not really challenged the factual  basis  of
             the Respondent's decision.  The Residence Permit issued to him
             was  on  the  basis  of  his  claimed  earnings  of   �73,687.
             Enquiries revealed that there was now some  real  doubt  about
             that claimed income.  This was brought about  by  consultation
             with  HMRC  which  showed  that,  despite  the  claimed  self-
             employment income, nothing had been paid in income  tax.   The
             Appellant's evidence is that he still has not paid any tax.

         14.  The Appellant claims that he was told by his  accountant  that
             this was normal and it was alright for him not to pay out that
             income.  He has  now  appointed  another  accountant  and  has
             notified HMRC of his income and his tax  liabilities  properly
             recalculated although not paid.  He was extremely vague  about
             the details of his original accountant and as yet  no  contact
             has been made with him.  Effectively, he is saying that he was
             let down by his accountant and mislead.

         15.  I totally reject this argument by  the  Appellant.   I  do  so
             because the Appellant is clearly a successful business man  in
             Ghana, he has been studying for a Masters in Law  and  already
             has a degree.  I do not believe that someone of his  level  of
             intelligence would not know that tax would be liable  on  that
             kind of income and I certainly do not accept that he has  been
             duped in the way that he claims.  I believe the truth is  that
             the Appellant knew full well that there would have  been  some
             tax liability and that he has actually  co-operated  with  the
             accountant in  preparing  false  accounts  in  order  to  try,
             successfully as it was, to persuade the  Respondent  that  his
             income was such that he met the requirements to be issued with
             a Tier 1 (General) Migrant Residence Permit.

         16.  I am satisfied that having  then  been  found  out  about  the
             falsity of the accounts he has  compounded  the  situation  by
             having other accounts prepared  showing  that  he  has  a  tax
             liability knowing full well that he would not able to pay  the
             tax in any event.

         17.  The Appellant claims to have earned these significant  amounts
             and yet at the same time given all that up in order to earn  a
             relatively low income working for Spencer  Arlington  Limited.
             His explanation as to why he should do that frankly lacks  any
             credibility.  I believe that the truth is that  he  never  had
             the claimed self-employed income and that the large sums  paid
             into his account were simply put there in  order  to  make  it
             look as if he had the income whereas  in  fact  it  was  being
             removed from his accounts within a very short period of  time.
             Contact with the people he was supposedly doing business  with
             ended up with suggestions that there had been  little  contact
             with the Appellant in the two years preceding  the  claim  was
             made that  Abdullah  Majeed  had  received  some  housing  and
             building work supply but no further information was  provided.
             Nothing had been paid in the last two years.  No  contact  was
             made with the other.

         18.  I am satisfied on the basis  of  the  enquiries  made  by  the
             Immigration Officers that the Appellant did  not  receive  the
             income claimed from self-employment.

         19.  Another reason for doubting the Appellant's  claim  concerning
             the self-employment is his lack of credible explanation as  to
             why he would give up such lucrative self-employment  in  order
             to continue with his work with Spencer Arlington Limited.   It
             makes no sense for anyone to give up a job bringing in �50,000
             or more to concentrate on work as a Carer for  about  �24,000.
             I am satisfied that the evidence shows that the Appellant  was
             not receiving the income  as  claimed  and  that  the  Tier  1
             (General) Migrant leave was properly cancelled.

         20.  The Appellant has tried to argue that  his  leave  should  not
             have been cancelled either as this would be  contrary  to  his
             Article 8 rights in the United Kingdom.  I have considered the
             facts of the case and reach the conclusion that the  Appellant
             does not fulfil any of the immigration rules.

         21.  I have gone on to consider the circumstances and take the view
             that there are no exceptional circumstances in this case which
             could lead to consideration of his  right  to  remain  in  the
             United Kingdom under Article 8 outside the immigration  rules.
             The fact that he has used false accounts in  order  to  obtain
             leave would count against him in any issue of  proportionality
             and as I have stated there are no exceptional circumstances."

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

17. At the hearing before me, Mr Aslam submitted there  were  a  number  of
    errors.  Firstly, the Home Office bundle before the First-tier Tribunal
    had not included the appendices to the explanatory statement.   So  the
    Secretary of State had not provided the evidence necessary  to  sustain
    her case, and the judge should have so directed himself and found  that
    there was no case to answer.

18. Secondly, he submitted the judge had adopted the  wrong  approach.   He
    did not remind himself of the grounds of refusal,  but  had  in  effect
    acted as if he was re-deciding the merits of the  application  made  in
    2012.  He thus asked himself the wrong question.  He had asked  himself
    whether the appellant had  proved  that  he  had  earnings  from  self-
    employment of �53,380 gross, rather than whether the case  put  forward
    by the respondent as justifying the cancellation of his leave was  made
    out.

19. Thirdly, with reference to paragraph [16], the judge failed  to  direct
    himself that the appellant was seeking to remain in the United Kingdom;
    if he was successful in that endeavour he would leave  himself  exposed
    to civil or potentially criminal proceedings by HMRC for the unpaid tax
    to which his amended returns made him liable.  It was wholly  illogical
    to suggest that he had created a tax liability which he knew  he  would
    never have to pay.  The only logical inference from the  submission  of
    amended  tax  returns  under  which  a  large  liability  for  tax  was
    acknowledged was that the appellant was genuinely liable for that  tax,
    which in turn meant that he had genuinely earned the money he claimed.

20. I asked Mr Aslam to address me on the alternative case run by the Chief
    Immigration  Officer  that  there  had  been  a  material   change   of
    circumstances justifying the cancellation  of  the  appellant's  leave.
    The material change of  circumstances  was  the  appellant's  professed
    cessation of self-employment from July 2012, with the consequence  that
    he had been only earning one third of the amount each year which he had
    claimed to be earning in order to be awarded 40 points on  his  Tier  1
    application.   Mr  Aslam  submitted  that  this  was  irrelevant.   The
    appellant only needed to show that his previous earnings had been at  a
    particular level.  It did not matter  that  he  had  not  been  earning
    anything like the same  level  as  his  previous  earnings  during  the
    currency of his Tier 1 visa.

21. I asked Mr Aslam what should happen to the appeal if  I  was  persuaded
    that an error of law was made out.  He agreed with Mr Whitwell  that  I
    could remake the decision on the documents,  without  the  need  for  a
    further hearing.  In that event, Mr Whitwell invited me to take account
    of the appendices  to  the  explanatory  statement  that  were  in  his
    possession, and which I had arranged to have copied.  Mr Aslam did  not
    object to my taking the appendices into account in  the  event  that  I
    decided to remake the decision.

Discussion

22. The first point argued by Mr Aslam was not raised  in  the  grounds  of
    appeal.

23. My bundle did not contain the appendices, so he is  probably  right  in
    his assertion that the First-tier Tribunal Judge did not have sight  of
    the appendices.  But the appellant was legally represented  before  the
    First-tier  Tribunal,  and  it  does  not   appear   that   the   legal
    representative applied for an adjournment or submitted that  the  judge
    could not take into account the contents of the  explanatory  statement
    in the absence of the supporting documents contained in the appendices.
     I accept that as a general rule the Secretary of State ought to  serve
    on the appellant all the evidence on which she relies. But it does  not
    appear from the grounds of  appeal  or  from  the  appellant's  witness
    statement that he challenged the  facts  recorded  in  the  explanatory
    statement.  It was thus open to the judge  to  direct  himself  at  the
    beginning  of  paragraph  [13]  that  the  appellant  had  not   really
    challenged the factual basis of the respondent's decision.   Since  the
    factual basis of the respondent's decision was not challenged,  it  was
    immaterial that the evidence  underpinning  the  explanatory  statement
    (such as  the  interview  transcripts)  had  not  been  served  on  the
    appellant.  Essentially, the line taken by way of  appeal  was  one  of
    confession and avoidance, not denial.  The appellant accepted  that  he
    had not paid any tax on his claimed earnings from self-employment,  and
    blamed this on his former accountant.

24. I consider that the decision is most vulnerable to attack on the  first
    ground pleaded in the grounds of  appeal,  which  was  that  the  judge
    misdirected himself as to the burden of proof.  At paragraph [12],  the
    judge ought to have directed himself that the burden  rested  with  the
    respondent to prove her case, and that the refusal under 321A(2), which
    is where "false representations  were  made  or  false  documents  were
    submitted ..., or material facts were not disclosed, in relation to the
    application for leave", required dishonesty on either  the  appellant's
    part  or  on  the  part  of  someone  else  involved  in  the  relevant
    application.

25. Ordinarily, the judge's misdirection would translate  into  a  material
    error of law.  But in this case it does not. As stated in  the  grounds
    of appeal, a decision under paragraph 321A(2) raises a  burden  on  the
    respondent to prove any contested precedent facts.  But in view of  the
    stance taken by the appellant by way of appeal, there were no contested
    precedent facts at the appeal hearing.  It was not  disputed  that,  on
    the facts set out in the notice of  refusal  of  leave  to  enter,  the
    respondent had raised a prima facie case of  fraud.   So  although  the
    legal burden always rested with the respondent to prove her  case,  the
    evidential burden had shifted to the appellant to rebut the prima facie
    case of fraud.  Thus the judge was right to approach  his  fact-finding
    exercise on the basis that the core issue was whether the appellant had
    provided a credible explanation for the discrepancies in  the  evidence
    relating to his claimed self-employment.

26. In The Queen (On the application Of Bijendra Giri) v Secretary of State
    [2015] EWCA Civ 784 Richards LJ reviewed two reported decisions of  the
    Upper Tribunal on the issue of standard  of  proof  at  paragraph  [35]
    onwards.  The Upper Tribunal had been wrong in JC  (Part  9  HC  395  -
    burden of proof) China [2007] UKAIT 0027 to hold that the  standard  of
    proof in relation to a question of deception will be at the higher  end
    of the spectrum of balance of probability.  The law had been  correctly
    stated in NA and Others (Cambridge College of Learning) Pakistan [2009]
    UKAIT 0031.  The seriousness of the  consequences  did  not  require  a
    different standard of proof, citing  Lord  Hoffman  in  Re  B  Children
    [2008] UKHL 35 where he said at paragraph [15]:

         "... there is only one rule of law, and only the occurrence of  the
         fact and issue must be proved to be more probable than not.  Common
         sense, not law, requires that in  deciding  this  question,  regard
         should  be  had,  to  whatever  extent  appropriate,  to   inherent
         probabilities"

27. The same accountant who had produced the accounts  relied  on  for  the
    purposes of the Tier 1 application had,  according  to  the  appellant,
    prepared a tax return for the tax year ended April 2012 which  did  not
    declare any earnings from self-employment in that tax year  -  and  the
    appellant saw no problem with this.

28. As a matter of common sense and inherent probabilities, the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge was fully entitled to find that this  was  preposterous,
    and that the appellant would not have been duped by his accountant into
    believing that he was not liable to pay any tax  on  his  self-employed
    earnings for the tax year April 2012.

29. It was thus open to the judge to find, for  the  reasons  he  gives  in
    paragraph [14], that the appellant co-operated with the  accountant  in
    preparing a false set of accounts to persuade the respondent  that  his
    income was such that he met the requirements to be issued with a Tier 1
    (General) Migrant residence permit.

30. The second pleaded ground of appeal is  that  the  judge's  finding  at
    paragraph [16] is illogical, and instead the judge ought to have  found
    that the appellant's recent dealings with HMRC showed that his  claimed
    earnings from self-employment were genuine.

31. I do not consider  that  the  judge's  finding  at  paragraph  [16]  is
    illogical or perverse.  On the evidence before the judge, the appellant
    was not earning enough from his employment as a support  worker  to  be
    able to pay the tax which he was now claiming to owe  HMRC.   Moreover,
    it is not true that the only inference that  can  reasonably  be  drawn
    from the appellant's recent dealings with  HMRC  is  that  his  claimed
    earnings from self-employment are genuine.  A belated declaration of  a
    liability  to  pay  tax  on  earnings  from  self-employment  is   also
    consistent with the appellant having to do what is necessary  in  order
    to win his appeal.  It is not implausible that the appellant, whom  the
    judge found to be dishonest, would be willing to inflate his  true  tax
    liability by some �11,500 (see paragraph 13 above) in order  to  secure
    his future in the UK.

32. Ground 4 is that the judge misdirected himself in asking whether  there
    were exceptional circumstances which could lead to a  consideration  of
    his right to remain in the United Kingdom under Article 8  outside  the
    Immigration Rules, as opposed to  asking  himself  whether  there  were
    compelling  circumstances  not  sufficiently   recognised   under   the
    Immigration  Rules   which   made   the   decision   appealed   against
    disproportionate.

33. Although the judge has not used the form of words approved by the Court
    of Appeal in SS Congo, I  note  that  in  Agyarko  &  Ors,  R  (on  the
    application of) v SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ 440 at [51] Sales LJ said:

         "There was  no  arguable  case  that  Mrs  Ikuga  could  show  that
         exceptional circumstances (my  emphasis)  existed  to  support  the
         conclusion that Article 8 required that she should be granted leave
         to remain."

34. Context is key. If a judge uses the "exceptional circumstances" test in
    a way which implies  that  the  applicant  has  to  surmount  a  higher
    threshold than the "compelling circumstances" test,  this  will  be  an
    error. But if its use does not imply a higher threshold,  there  is  no
    error.

35. The judge's form of words does not disclose  an  error.  No  compelling
    circumstances were identified in the grounds  of  appeal  as  being  in
    play.  The appellant's partner and child were in Ghana at the time that
    he was refused leave to enter, and it was not suggested that the effect
    of the decision appealed against  was  to  impact  on  the  appellant's
    family life in the UK.  While questions 1 and  2  of  the  Razgar  test
    would  have  to  be  answered  in  his  favour  with  regard   to   the
    establishment of private life in the UK,  questions  3  and  4  of  the
    Razgar test had to be answered in favour of  the  respondent.   On  the
    issue of proportionality, the appellant's  use  of  false  accounts  in
    order to obtain leave would plainly reinforce the  public  interest  in
    the appellant's exclusion.  In AM (S117 B) Malawi [2015] UKUT 260 (IAC)
    the UT held that an appellant can obtain no positive right to  a  grant
    of leave to remain from either s117B (2) or (3), whatever his degree of
    fluency in English, or the strength of his financial resources.

36. As noted by Mr Whitwell, the appellant gave no evidence in  support  of
    an Article 8 claim in his witness statement, and so the judge's finding
    on proportionality required no further elaboration.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  dismissing  the  appeal  under  the
Rules and on human rights grounds does not contain  an  error  of  law,  and
accordingly the decision stands.  This  appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  is
dismissed.

I make no anonymity direction.
