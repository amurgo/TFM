                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, David George Lee Shue, was born on 31 December 1972  and
    is a male citizen of Jamaica.  He has appealed against  a  decision  of
    the First-tier  Tribunal  which  was  promulgated  on  14  April  2014.
    Permission was granted on the basis that the  appellant  (who  did  not
    attend before the First-tier Tribunal)  should  have  been  granted  an
    adjournment because his partner was in hospital at the time  undergoing
    a serious heart operation.

 2. I am aware that the same appellant appeared before me in  a  completely
    separate appeal in the Upper Tribunal which I allowed and which, so far
    as I am aware, has not been appealed successfully by the  Secretary  of
    State to the Court of Appeal.   The  present  appeal  concerns  a  very
    similar application for leave to remain which  was  the  subject  of  a
    successful appeal.  The appellant did not appear before me on  16  July
    2014 at Bradford.

 3. In light of the fact that the appellant  has  now  been  successful  in
    proceedings before the Upper Tribunal, albeit in different proceedings,
    he should, by now, have been granted leave  to  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom, noting also that he failed to attend the hearing  on  16  July
    2014, I consider the correct  course  of  action  is  to  dismiss  this
    appeal.

Notice of Decision

This appeal is dismissed.
