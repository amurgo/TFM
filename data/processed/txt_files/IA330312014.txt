Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr M Rashid, Counsel instructed by David A Grand
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr C Avery, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria born on 25th August 1959  and  he
    appeals under Section 82(1) of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum
    Act 2002 against the refusal dated 24th July 2014 to grant him leave to
    remain in the UK as a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant under the Points
    Based System.

 2.  The  respondent  claimed  that  the  appellant  did  not  satisfy  the
    Immigration  Rules  under  paragraph  245ZX(c)  and  245ZX(d)  of   the
    Immigration Rules.  It was stated that it was a requirement of a Tier 4
    (General) Student visa that he sit a Pearson English test  and  had  to
    have assigned that Pearson test score to the UK  Border  Agency.   When
    the website was checked 24th July 2014  no  score  had  been  assigned.
    Although he  provided  an  English  language  certificate  he  had  not
    provided Pearson website access to the UKBA and he  did  not  meet  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules.

 3. As regards his maintenance it  was  not  accepted  therefore  that  the
    appellant had established presence and therefore he needed to show  the
    maintenance fees of �9,000 plus any outstanding  course  fees  for  the
    first year of  his  course  and  to  show  that  he  held  this  for  a
    consecutive 28 day period to meet the Tier 4 (General) Student  Migrant
    maintenance fund requirements.

 4. It was also stated that at the time of his application on 28th May 2014
    he no longer had any valid leave to remain and therefore did  not  have
    established presence.  I note that in the reasons for refusal, and this
    did not appear to be recorded, it was stated that the appellant had  no
    leave to remain at the time of his application and therefore there  was
    no right of appeal against the decision.  This did not appear to  be  a
    point taken by the Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal.   Although  there
    was an application to extend time in relation to Rule  7  of  the  2005
    Procedure Rules it would appear that this was considered on  the  basis
    that the appeal was out of time further to BO and Others (Extension  of
    time for appealing) Nigeria [2006] UKAIT 00035.  It  was  indicated  by
    Judge Shanahan in a decision on 26th September 2014 [6] that there  was
    an arguable case that the appellant was entitled to a right  of  appeal
    and there  were  special  circumstances  to  extend  time  but  it  was
    specifically stated by Judge Perry, however, that the  application  was
    out of time.

 5. In the event, however, Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Perry dismissed
    the appellant's appeal under the Immigration Rules.

 6. He noted  at  paragraph  26  that  the  appellant  contended  that  his
    application was made online on 23rd May.  However,  the  judge  clearly
    found the application was made by post and stated as follows:

         "The appellant contended that his application was made online on 23
         May.  However the Tier 4 application form at page 2  of  14  states
         'you need to submit this to us  by  post  in  order  to  make  your
         application'.  While it is the case as the appellant  asserts  that
         his credit card was debited on 23 May 2014 with the application gee
         [sic] of �422, it remains the case that the application  itself  is
         only valid if made by post.  The appellant did submit the documents
         in post but not until 28 May.  I find that this application was out
         of time."

    The judge made a clear finding that the application was out of time.

 7. At the hearing before me Mr Rashid submitted that the  application  was
    in fact made on 23rd May 2014 and that the appellant  initially  filled
    out an application summary  which  showed  that  his  credit  card  was
    charged on 23rd May 2014.  He stated that this was a barcoded  document
    which was printed out after the payment was made.  I  was  referred  to
    page 2 of the application  where  it  stated  "this  is  your  official
    document for your application" and to  page  14.   In  essence  it  was
    submitted that the appellant made the application on 23rd May 2014  and
    that these further documents (including the  application)  were  merely
    the supporting documents which were  submitted.   The  application  was
    made online.  The appellant should be categorised as having established
    presence in which case  he  could  comply  with  the  maintenance  fees
    required.

 8. The onus was on the Secretary of State to establish that access to  the
    Pearson website should  be  given  to  UKBA  and  there  was  no  clear
    indication of  when  the  Rules  changed  and  they  certainly  did  so
    subsequently to the appellant's application.

 9. Mr Avery submitted R (on the application of Wasif) v Secretary of State
    for the Home Department (rule 34 - "print and send") (IJR) [2015]  UKUT
    00270 (IAC).  Mr Rashid did not  acknowledge  that  the  appellant  had
    opted for option 2 and in  any  event  he  stated  that  this  judgment
    postdated the hearing date.

10. Mr Avery submitted that the appellant had opted for the print and  send
    option but in any  event  the  appellant  needed  to  comply  with  the
    Immigration Rules as they were at the date of decision.

11. In conclusion R (on the application of Wasif) v Secretary of State  for
    the Home Department explains and declares the law as it was as  at  the
    date of application and decision and states as follows:

         "(i) An application for leave to remain in the United Kingdom  must
             comply with the requirements of paragraph A34 and all material
             provisions of paragraphs 34A - 34K of the Immigration Rules.

         (ii) Between June 2013 and August 2014, Tier 4 applicants  had  the
             choice of submitting their applications either on line  or  by
             the 'Print and Send' mechanism.

         (iii)    The correct construction of the Rules is as follows:

             (a)  The first of these options required the submission of the
                  completed application form on line and  the  provision  of
                  supporting documents by post.

             (b)   The  second  option,  'Print  and  Send',  required  the
                  applicant to print the completed application form and send
                  it, with accompanying supporting documents, by post.   The
                  'Print and Send' instruction does not amount to an on-line
                  application.

         (iv) A  failure  to  comply  with  the  requirements  in  34A  (per
             paragraph 34C) invalidates the application."

12. It is clear that this describes the process  for  Tier  4  applications
    between June 2013 and August 2014  and  I  note  that  the  appellant's
    application was made in May of 2014.

13. The judgment of Wasif makes clear the law and clearly shows that  there
    were two options to be adopted when applicants were applying.   One  is
    the online form and the second print and send.

14. As President McCloskey states at paragraph 12 of Wasif:

         "The 'print and send' mechanism was first introduced in  the  Rules
         in October 2012.   I  have,  for  convenience,  reproduced  in  the
         Appendix to this judgment the  version  of  paragraph  A34  of  the
         Immigration Rules which governed the Applicant's application at the
         material time (it has been superseded subsequently).  Giving effect
         to the above principles I construe this as follows:

         (i)  The opening paragraph establishes,  in  unambiguous  language,
             two options: the applicant is to either complete 'the relevant
             online   application   process'   in   accordance   with   the
             requirements  of  paragraph  A34(iii)  or  make  use  of  'the
             specified application form' in accordance with paragraphs  34A
             - 34D.

         Option 1

         (ii) The first option requires the application to be made  via  the
             UKBA  website,  in  accordance  with   the   process   therein
             stipulated.  This  requires  the  applicant  to,  inter  alia,
             select the appropriate 'immigration category'.

         (iii)    Invocation of the online option requires any specific  fee
             to be paid in accordance with the 'method specified'.

         (iv) Invocation of the online application option  clearly  requires
             the completed application to  be  submitted  on  line  by  the
             relevant date.

         (v)  Where the online application option is selected, the  Rule  is
             unequivocal in the requirement relating to  the  provision  of
             'supporting documents': these must be submitted  by  post  'in
             the specified manner within 15 working days of  submission  of
             the online application'.

         (vi) Where the online application option is selected, the  sanction
             for  non-compliance  with   the   relevant   requirements   is
             unambiguous: the application '... will be invalid if  it  does
             not comply with the requirements  of  paragraph  A34(iii)  and
             will not be considered.'

         Option 2

         (vii)    Where the second of the two options offered  is  selected,
             the 'specified application form' must be used  and  completed.
             This is accessed via the UKBA website.

         (viii)   In this event, the appropriate fee must  be  paid  in  the
             manner prescribed.

         (ix) The specified types of information must be provided.

         (x)   The  completed  application  must  be  accompanied   by   the
             photographs  and  documents  specified  as  mandatory  in  the
             application form and/or related guidance notes  and  the  form
             must be signed by the applicant.

         (xi) Transmission of the completed application form, accompanied by
             the stipulated photographs and documents, must be by  pre-paid
             post to UKBA or in person at a public enquiry office of  UKBA,
             subject only to the exceptions listed.

         (xii)    Where  the  'Print  and  Send'  option  is  selected,  the
             sanction for non-compliance with the relevant requirements  is
             unambiguous: the application '... will be invalid if  it  does
             not comply with the requirements  of  paragraph  A34(iii)  and
             will not be considered.'"

15. As stated in Judge Perry's decision the application  was  submitted  by
    post.  The application itself is stamped 29th May 2014 and although  it
    is clear that there was a payment made by a credit card dated 23rd  May
    2014 the application was not submitted  online  because  the  form  was
    signed in line with Option 2, (x) above.  The form did not refer to  an
    online application and the applicant signed the form.  The  declaration
    at the close of the application clearly shows not only the  appellant's
    signature with a date of 23rd May 2014 but  also  the  representative's
    signature and the date of 28th May 2014.  The representative  confirmed



         'that I am aware of the contents of this application, including its
         supporting documents and that the application is to be best of  his
         knowledge and belief true and correct'.

    It is clear to me that this application although paid for on  23rd  May
    2014 was not completed in substance until 28th May  2014  whereupon  it
    was posted and stamped as received by the Home Office on 29th May 2014.

16. Further to Regulation 34G, where the application form is sent  by  post
    it is the date of posting which is relevant and thus it is  clear  that
    this application was made for the purposes of the Immigration Rules  on
    28th May. This indeed is what is recorded by the Secretary of State  in
    the refusal letter. I do not accept Mr  Rashid's  submission  that  the
    application was already made on the date of payment and this is  merely
    following on  of  supporting  documentation.   The  application  states
    clearly at the top of page 2

         'This is your official document for your application

         You need to submit this to  us  by  post  in  order  to  make  your
         application'

17. The application was signed by the  representative  on  28th  May  2014,
    after the expiry of the appellant's leave.

18. There was  no  error  in  Judge  Perry's  assessment  with  regard  the
    immigration  rules.   The  appellant  himself  acknowledged  that   the
    requirement to assign the Pearson test score came into  effect  on  1st
    July 2014.  It was a requirement as at the  date  of  the  respondent's
    decision on 24th July 2014 that the Pearson test score was assigned  to
    the UK Border Agency.  There was no dispute from the appellant as Judge
    Perry confirmed that it was not so assigned as required.  The  relevant
    date for the application of the rules is the date of the  decision  not
    the date of application.  As stated by Lord Neuberger in Odelola [2009]
    UKHL 25

         'I turn, then, to the central issue, namely whether the  amendments
         made by the 2006 Statement extend to an application made,  but  not
         determined, before the Statement came into force.  In  common  with
         all your Lordships, I have reached the conclusion that they do'.

19.  The error of law in Judge Perry's decision, if there is any,  is  that
    there was in fact no valid appeal before him  as  the  application  for
    leave to remain was made after the appellant's leave  expired  on  24th
    May 2014.  Under Section 82(1)  of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002 a person may only appeal where there is an  immigration
    decision and it would not be the case that the refusal would result  in
    the person having no leave to enter or remain as the appellant's  leave
    had already expired.  It was not that there was no 'in country'  appeal
    - there was no appeal.   As  there  was  no  valid  appeal  before  the
    Tribunal, it had no jurisdiction.

20. The Judge erred materially for the reasons identified.  I set aside the
    decision pursuant to Section  12(2)(a)  of  the  Tribunals  Courts  and
    Enforcement Act 2007 (TCE 2007) and remake the decision  under  section
    12(2) (b) (ii) of the TCE 2007

21. I set aside the decision and insert a decision to the effect  that  the
    Tribunal has no jurisdiction and there is no valid appeal.

Decision

No valid appeal.
