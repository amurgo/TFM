                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr M Karnik, Counsel, instructed by M A Consultants
For the Respondent:    Mr I Jarvis, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. By a decision that I made dated 13 November 2014 I found that there was
    a material error of  law  in  the  determination  of  Designated  Judge
    McClure in  relation  to  an  application  made  on  10  October  2012.
    Accordingly I am remaking the decision. The appellant is a national  of
    Pakistan who arrived lawfully in the United Kingdom in March 2008 as  a
    visitor and in August 2010, at which time his last  leave  expired,  he
    remained.  On 24 April 2011 he married a British citizen and the couple
    started cohabiting on  28  January  2012  and  they  have  two  British
    children.  On 12 October 2012 the appellant  made  an  application  for
    leave to remain which was refused on  4  October  2013  and  a  removal
    decision was made.  The appeal against that  decision  was  the  appeal
    which was determined by Designated Judge McClure.

 2. It is common ground that the legal regime that I have  to  consider  is
    the legal regime that applies on 4 October 2013, that is  the  date  of
    the respondent's decision, and it requires me to look at the Rules then
    in force.  For the purposes of this judgment I am not going to set  out
    the requirements of the Rules although I will insert those  Rules  into
    the written determination.  Suffice it to  say  that  the  requirements
    were under two routes: the routes either as a partner or as a parent.

 3. The route as a partner required the applicant  to  be  married  to  his
    spouse or in a relationship set out in GEN 1.2:

         GEN.1.2. For the purposes of this Appendix "partner" means-

            (i) the applicant's spouse;

            (ii) the applicant's civil partner;

            (iii) the applicant's fianc�(e) or proposed civil partner; or

            (iv) a person who has been living together with  the  applicant
            in a relationship akin to a marriage or civil  partnership  for
            at least two years prior to the date of application,

         unless the context otherwise requires.

 4. The appellant went through a form of marriage which was not  recognised
    in English law and no attempt has been made to obtain the status  of  a
    spouse by undergoing a civil ceremony  of  marriage  which  would  have
    recognised both in law and in religious terms the fact that the  couple
    are married.  This has  a  significant  bearing  upon  the  application
    because for the purposes of the partner  route  the  appellant  has  to
    establish the requirements of GEN 1.2.  Those are that he is  either  a
    spouse according to law or a civil partner, which  does  not  apply  in
    these circumstances, or a fianc� or proposed civil partner or has  been
    living together with the appellant in a relationship akin  to  marriage
    for at least two years prior to the date of application.

 5. Whilst the precise words have varied between the version of  the  Rules
    on 4 October 2013 and the Rules on 11 March 2015, which was the date of
    the  hearing  before  the  Designated  Judge,  the  substance  of  that
    requirement has remained the same and the appellant did not  meet  that
    requirement because he had not been living with the appellant  for  the
    period of two years prior to the date of application.

 6. There is in my judgement nothing unlawful in the Secretary of State  or
    Parliament when dealing with a relationship  which  falls  short  of  a
    recognised marriage or civil partnership making the existence  of  that
    relationship dependent upon a period  of  cohabitation  as  a  mark  of
    establishing the permanence of that relationship  so  that  it  has  an
    equivalent status in its being an established relationship.

 7. The appellant does not meet that requirement and accordingly he  cannot
    succeed under the partner route.

 8. The second route is as a parent.  There is no doubt that the  appellant
    is a parent but in order to meet the  requirements  of  the  Rules  for
    limited or indefinite leave to remain the appellant must not  fall  for
    refusal under Section S-LTR which is the suitability of leave to remain
    and he must meet the requirements of Section  E-LTRPT  eligibility  for
    leave to remain as a parent.  These requirements  are  subject  to  the
    additional requirements of E-LTRPT2.2 to 2.4 and E-ELTRPT3.1.   Finally
    there is the application of EX1.

 9. The requirements are:

         Section R-LTRPT: Requirements for limited  leave  to  remain  as  a
         parent

            R-LTRPT.1.1.  The  requirements  to  be  met  for  limited   or
            indefinite leave to remain as a parent or partner are-

                (a)    the applicant and the child must be in the UK;

                (b)    the applicant must have made a valid application  for
                   limited or indefinite leave to  remain  as  a  parent  or
                   partner; and either

                (c)    (i)  the applicant must not fall  for  refusal  under
                      Section S-LTR: Suitability leave to remain; and

                   (ii)    the applicant meets all of  the  requirements  of
                      Section ELTRPT: Eligibility for leave to remain as  a
                      parent, or

                (d)    (i)  the applicant must not fall for refusal under S-
                      LTR:

                   (ii)     the  applicant   meets   the   requirements   of
                      paragraphs E-LTRPT.2.2-2.4. and E-LTRPT.3.1.; and

                   (iii)   paragraph EX.1. applies.

         Section E-LTRPT: Eligibility for  limited  leave  to  remain  as  a
         parent

            E-LTRPT.1.1. To qualify for limited leave to remain as a parent
            all of the requirements of paragraphs E-LTRPT.2.2. to 5.2. must
            be met.

            Relationship requirements

            E-LTRPT.2.2. The child of the applicant must be-

                (a)    under the age of 18 years at the date of application,
                   or where the child has turned 18   years of age since the
                   applicant was first granted entry clearance or  leave  to
                   remain as a parent under this  Appendix,  must  not  have
                   formed an  independent  family  unit  or  be  leading  an
                   independent life;

                (b)    living in the UK; and

                (c)    a British Citizen or settled in the UK; or

                (d)    has lived in the UK continuously for at least  the  7
                   years immediately preceding the date of  application  and
                   paragraph EX.1. applies.

            E-LTRPT.2.3. Either-

                (a)    the applicant must have sole parental  responsibility
                   for the child  or  the  child  normally  lives  with  the
                   applicant and not their other parent (who  is  a  British
                   Citizen or settled in the UK); or

                (b)    the parent or carer  with  whom  the  child  normally
                   lives must be-

                   (i) a British Citizen in the UK or settled in the UK;

                   (ii)    not the partner  of  the  applicant  (which  here
                      includes a person who has been in a relationship with
                      the applicant for less than two years  prior  to  the
                      date of application); and

                   (iii)   the applicant must not be eligible to  apply  for
                      leave to remain as a partner under this Appendix.

            E-LTRPT.2.4.

                (a)    The applicant must provide evidence  that  they  have
                   either-

                   (i) sole parental responsibility for the child,  or  that
                      the child normally lives with them; or

                   (ii) access rights to the child; and

                (b)    The applicant must provide  evidence  that  they  are
                   taking, and intend to continue to take, an active role in
                   the child's upbringing.

         Section EX: Exception

            EX.1. This paragraph applies if

                (a)

                   (i) the applicant has a genuine and  subsisting  parental
                      relationship with a child who-

                      (aa) is under the age of 18 years, or was  under  the
                         age of 18  years  when  the  applicant  was  first
                         granted leave on the  basis  that  this  paragraph
                         applied;

                      (bb) is in the UK;

                      (cc) is a British Citizen or  has  lived  in  the  UK
                         continuously for at least the 7 years  immediately
                         preceding the date of application; and

                   (ii)    it would not be reasonable to expect the child to
                      leave the UK; or

                (b)     the  applicant  has   a   genuine   and   subsisting
                   relationship with a partner who is in the  UK  and  is  a
                   British Citizen, settled in the UK  or  in  the  UK  with
                   refugee leave or humanitarian protection, and  there  are
                   insurmountable obstacles  to  family  life  with     that
                   partner continuing outside of the UK.

10. The appellant fails to  meet  the  requirements  as  a  result  of  the
    relationship which he has with  his  'wife'.   He  falls  foul  of  the
    requirements of 2.3 because he has been in a relationship for less than
    two years at the date of application.

11. The purpose of this requirement is to draw a  distinction  between  the
    nuclear family where the family are living together as a unit  and  the
    circumstances where a parent has sole responsibility  for  a  child  or
    access  rights  to  the  child.   The  distinction  between  those  two
    significantly different types of case is  to  draw  a  line  between  a
    nuclear family and a family which is separated in some form or another.

12. What, however, the Rules do not set out to establish is a  route  where
    the parent is living in a relationship, short of marriage,  where  that
    relationship has lasted for less than two years prior to  the  date  of
    application.

13. The requirements of EX1 do not require any separate consideration.

14. The point made by Mr Karnik is that the Rules are either flawed or that
    the circumstances in  which  the  appellant  finds  himself  should  be
    treated as such that an exception should be  made  to  the  Immigration
    Rules because they do not properly reflect the rights of a  father  who
    is in a subsisting relationship with his 'common law' wife  (if  I  can
    say that) and their  children.   What  he  submits  is  that  from  the
    commencement of the child's birth there is a relationship  between  the
    child and his father which should not  be  subject  to  any  limitation
    where the couple are not married; a requirement  to  have  been  living
    together for a period of two years prior to the date of application  is
    an unlawful bar to the exercise of that right.

15. In this way he says either the  Rules  are  unlawful  or  an  exception
    should be made because of this lacuna. In my judgement this  is  not  a
    lacuna.  It is a careful construction of a policy  which  distinguishes
    between a nuclear family which is either together because of  the  bond
    of marriage or civil partnership or the bond  which  is  implied  by  a
    relationship which has lasted for more than two years and the situation
    where the relationship has either never taken the  form  of  a  nuclear
    family and one parent is looking after the relevant child or there is a
    parent who has the benefit of access rights to the child.  It cannot be
    said that the construction of the Rules  is  such  as  to  render  them
    unlawful by reason of the  distinction  that  is  drawn  between  these
    various categories or that,  by  reason  of  the  appellant  not  being
    provided with the benefit that he seeks to obtain, an exception  should
    be made in his case because the Rules do not provide it.   It  is  true
    that he does not meet the requirements of the Rules but that is  a  far
    cry from saying that the Rules require an exception to be made  in  his
    case.  He does  not  meet  the  Rules  and  there  are  no  exceptional
    circumstances.

16. Having a child of a British parent or having a child who is  a  British
    citizen does not for that reason alone create a right to remain in  the
    United Kingdom for the benefit of a non-national parent.

17. In those circumstances I am satisfied  that  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules are not met and the appeal fell  to  be  refused  for
    that reason alone.

18. It is as well to consider the requirements of sections 117A-D  inserted
    into the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act, 2002 and  whether  or
    not there is a place  for  a  consideration  outside  the  Rules.   The
    considerations set out in s.117B do not materially alter  the  position
    in favour of the appellant.   The  operation  of  the  Rules  has  been
    recently considered by the Court of Appeal in Singh and Khalid  v  SSHD
    [2015] EWCA Civ 74 (12 February 2015).  It is not necessary  to  pursue
    this, save to say that the agreement reached by the parties as  to  the
    applicable Rules is in accordance with the view expressed by the  Court
    of Appeal.

19. The appellant does not meet the requirements of the  Immigration  Rules
    for the reasons that I have stated and even in  the  broadest  view  of
    those Rules there is no reason why a departure should be  made  in  his
    case or indeed in the case of the children.

20. Whilst the child's best interests are a factor which to be  taken  into
    account, in the circumstances of this case there is a  route  which  is
    available to the appellant.  Indeed it may even be a route which he has
    already pursued.  That does not in my judgement mean that the decision,
    the subject of this appeal, was an unlawful one or  fails  properly  to
    afford due for either his wife's or his  children's  rights  under  the
    Human Rights Convention and for these reasons I dismiss the appeal.

Notice of Decision

The First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  made  an  error  on  a  point  of  law.   I
substitute a decision to the same effect: the appeal is dismissed under  the
Immigration Rules.

No anonymity direction is made.
