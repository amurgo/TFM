For the Appellant:     Mr S Winter, Advocate, instructed by Maguire
                 (Solicitors) Scotland Ltd
For the Respondent: Mr A Mullen, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                         DETERMINATION AND REASONS)

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan, born on 15 July 1992.  He  came
    to the UK as a student in May 2011, but did not study.  His  leave  was
    curtailed as from 16 June 2012.  He  did  not  leave  the  UK,  and  in
    February 2015 applied for leave to remain on the basis  of  family  and
    private life.     The respondent refused his  application  on  13  July
    2015.  First-tier Tribunal Judge Mozolowski  dismissed  his  appeal  by
    decision promulgated on 9 June 2016.

 2. The appellant's wife is a citizen of the UK, born on 16 July 1985.  She
    and the appellant began a relationship in or around July 2012,  shortly
    after she separated from her former husband.  The evidence was somewhat
    conflicting as to their degree of cohabitation prior to their  marriage
    on 17 November 2014, but little turns on that.  She has a son, aged  12
    at the time of the FtT hearing, and a daughter, then aged 7.   Her  son
    lives nearby with his father, and she sees  him  daily.   Her  daughter
    lives with her and the appellant.

 3. The grounds of appeal to the UT (lightly prï¿½cised) are as follows.

      Ground 1 - failing to resolve conflicting  findings  material  to  the
      outcome of the appeal on whether the relationship is genuine or not.

      The judge  found  at  paragraph  24  and  at  paragraph  27  that  the
      requirements of  the  rules  were  not  met  because  the  appellant's
      relationship with his partner was not genuine and they did not  intend
      to live permanently together. However, at paragraph 37 in relation  to
      the claim outside the rules the judge accepted that  the  relationship
      was  genuine.  "In  particular,  such  a  finding  has  precluded  any
      examination of paragraph EX1 of appendix FM  and  whether  the  appeal
      ought to be allowed under those provisions".

      Ground 2 - error of law when assessing section 117B (6)  of  the  2002
      Act.

      The judge erred at paragraph 34 ...:

      (i) The judge found that the appellant and his partner do not  have  a
      qualifying child, failing to recognise that it  is  not  necessary  to
      have "parental responsibility" in law for there to  exist  a  parental
      relationship.  It is not a pre-requisite that any child  must  be  the
      biological child. This undermines also the findings at paragraph 40.

      (ii) The judge failed to  ask  the  correct  question  when  assessing
      whether there is a parental relationship between the appellant and his
      step-daughter, having regard to the  fact  that  they  live  together.
      Although his step-daughter has contact with her biological father, the
      correct question is whether the appellant has stepped into  the  shoes
      of a parent. Had the judge asked the correct question then on the fact
      that the appellant lived with his step-daughter  and  other  evidence,
      the judge ought to have found that there was a parental  relationship.
      This also undermines the findings at paragraph 40.

      (iii) In any event, the judge erred by failing to resolve  conflicting
      findings, accepting at paragraph 37 that the appellant has  a  genuine
      relationship with his partner, it is unclear why the  judge  does  not
      accept at paragraph 34 that the appellant has a  genuine  relationship
      with his step-daughter, when he  lives  with  his  partner  and  step-
      daughter.

      (iv) That being so, the judge erred in law by failing to find  it  was
      not in the public interest to remove the appellant when he  meets  the
      terms of section 117B (6) ... and where  the  judge  appears  to  have
      accepted that it would not be reasonable  for  the  appellant's  step-
      daughter to leave the UK ... In any event it would not  be  reasonable
      for the appellant's step-daughter to leave the UK where she  would  be
      separated from her mother, lose contact with her brother ... and  with
      her biological father ... If the foregoing is correct it would  render
      the findings on maintaining family life from abroad and in relation to
      entry clearance as well the reliance on  the  appellant's  immigration
      history otiose.

      Ground 3 - error of law when assessing whether it is  disproportionate
      to remove the appellant in  relation  to  his  relationship  with  his
      British spouse.

      (i) While the judge recognises at paragraph 37 that little  weight  is
      to be placed on the relationship in terms of section  117B  (4)(b)  of
      the 2002 Act and acknowledges at paragraph  38  that  the  appellant's
      wife ... would not relocate to Pakistan and  there  is  likely  to  be
      prolonged or indefinite separation ... the judge  erred  when  finding
      that such  separation  would  be  justified  as  family  life  can  be
      continued to  visits  to  Pakistan  and  by  telephone  or  electronic
      communications ... Family life cannot be continued by  the  occasional
      visit or by Skype, email or letters and it  is  not  proportionate  to
      rely on  where  family  members  have  been  living  together  ...  In
      addition, the judge erred at paragraph 31 as there was  no  evidential
      basis for finding that the sponsor received benefits  to  support  the
      appellant. The appellant is not in receipt of public benefits  and  in
      that regard would come within sections 117B (2) and (3) ...

      (ii) Further the judge misdirected herself by failing to apply anxious
      scrutiny when placing reliance on the appellant returning to apply for
      entry clearance when the entry clearance officer is not  in  a  better
      position to examine the case, it is better for the appeal to be  dealt
      with once and for all, and it is only comparatively rarely that  entry
      clearance should be relied on where there are children involved, there
      would be prolonged or indefinite  delay,  and  there  is  no  sensible
      reason for the appellant to return to apply ... [Chikwamba]

 4. Mr Mullen submitted that at  paragraph  24  the  judge's  reference  to
    paragraph E-LTRP.1.7 [genuine and subsisting relationship] was  a  slip
    of the pen, and the judge intended  her  decision  to  turn  rather  on
    paragraph E-LTRP.1.10 [intention to live together  permanently  in  the
    UK], so that there was no tension with the finding at paragraph 37 of a
    genuine relationship; the judge meant that the relationship was genuine
    but one-sided and not long term; there must be a difference between the
    tests of a genuine relationship  and  of  intention  to  live  together
    permanently.  He further submitted that paragraph 40 had to be read  as
    a finding of no genuine and subsisting  parental  relationship  between
    the appellant and his wife's children, who have such relationships with
    their natural mother and with their natural father, and not with him.

 5. Those were valiant arguments on the two essential points raised for the
    appellant, but insufficient to sustain  the  decision.   It  cannot  be
    gainsaid that the judge at paragraph 23 held that the relationship  was
    not genuine, and at paragraph 37 that it was.  Paragraph 40 reads as  a
    broad proportionality assessment, a striking of a  balance,  when  what
    was required was a decision  on  whether  the  connection  between  the
    appellant and the  children  is  "a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
    relationship".  Resolution of that question (of mixed fact and law)  is
    lacking, without which no sustainable final conclusion could be reached
    (either under the rules or in terms of section 117B(6)).

 6. As to the rest of the grounds, it does not automatically follow that if
    the appellant has a relationship  with  the  mother  of  the  children,
    resides in  the  same  household  as  one  child  and  sees  the  other
    regularly, that he must be in a parental relationship  with  either  or
    both of them.  That is to be determined on all the evidence.   The case
    seems more likely  to  resolve  around  that  than  on  whether  it  is
    reasonable to expect the children to leave the UK,  given  their  wider
    circumstances.  It is also  doubtful  whether  the  case  involves  any
    principle set out in Chikwamba.  However, these observations  are  made
    in passing, as the two errors identified above resolve the case  before
    the UT.

 7. The decision of the FtT is set aside.  None  of  its  findings  are  to
    stand. The nature of the case is such that it is appropriate  in  terms
    of section 12(2)(b)(i) of the 2007 Act and of Practice Statement 7.2 to
    remit the case to the FtT for an entirely fresh hearing.  The member(s)
    of the FtT chosen  to  consider  the  case  or  not  to  include  Judge
    Mozolowski.

 8. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
