                       Judicial Review Decision Notice



               The Queen on the application of Prabhu Sekaran
                                                                   Applicant

                 Secretary of State for the Home Department
                                                                  Respondent


                     Before Upper Tribunal Judge Frances




               Application for judicial review: substantive decision


Having considered  all  documents  lodged  and  having  heard  the  parties'
respective representatives, Mr S Karim, of  Counsel,  instructed  by  Deccan
Prime Solicitors, on behalf of the Applicant and, Mr B Bedford  of  Counsel,
instructed by the Government Legal Department, on behalf of the  Respondent,
at a hearing at Field House, London on 4 February 2019.


                                  JUDGMENT

   1. The applicant challenges the respondent's decision of 12 January  2018
      refusing his application for indefinite leave to remain as  a  Tier  1
      (General)  migrant  and  the  administrative  review  decision  of  14
      February 2018 maintaining the decision. His wife is his dependant.


   2. The applicant is a citizen of India born on 1 February 1982.  He  came
      to the UK as a student in April 2009. He was granted leave  to  remain
      as a Tier 1 (Post-Study Work) migrant until  10  August  2012.  On  31
      March 2011, he applied for  further  leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  1
      (General) migrant which was granted and leave extended until  23  July
      2016.


   3. On 23 July 2016 the applicant applied for indefinite leave to  remain.
      He responded  to  the  'paper  genuineness  test'  questionnaire  [the
      questionnaire] on 10 May 2017. The respondent refused the  application
      under paragraphs 322(5) and 245CD(b) on 12 January  2018  because  the
      applicant had claimed earnings from self-employment of �37,150 in  the
      period 1 September 2010 to 26 March 2011 in his application for  leave
      to remain made in March 2011 and declared �4270 to HMRC in  his  self-
      assessment tax return for the year 2010/2011.  The  respondent  stated
      that it was not credible that an accountant would make such a  mistake
      and rejected the applicant's explanation given in  the  questionnaire,
      that he was not able to verify his tax return, on the basis  that  the
      applicant would have provided information to  his  accountant  at  the
      time and would have been aware of the discrepancies.


   4. In his application for administrative review, the applicant  submitted
      that paragraph 322(5) did not apply because he  had  not  intended  to
      deceive or to submit an inaccurate  tax  return.  There  had  been  an
      omission  which  had  now  been  rectified.  There   were   no   false
      representations or deception. The  respondent  had  failed  to  follow
      guidance in AA Nigeria [2009] EWCA Civ 773.


   5. The decision to refuse leave was maintained on  administrative  review
      on the ground that the Applicant was responsible for ensuring his  tax
      return was correct and he had either failed  to  declare  earnings  to
      HMRC or over-inflated his income  in  his  application  for  leave  to
      remain. The decision maker stated: "You raise AA Nigeria  [2009]  EWCA
      and TR (CCOL cases) Pakistan [2011] UKUT to support your  application,
      arguing there was no intention to deceive the Secretary of  State.  On
      review the case laws are relating to deception being  used  to  obtain
      leave of some form in the UK. However, this case  law  is  not  deemed
      relevant to your application as your application has not been  refused
      on deception, but on character and conduct."


   6. The applicant challenged the decisions on the following grounds:


        a. The respondent had reached irrational conclusions;


        b. The respondent failed to engage with material matters; and


        c. The respondent  had  acted  unlawfully  in  his  application  of
           paragraph  322(5)  and  had  failed  to  properly  exercise  his
           discretion.


   7. It was submitted  that  the  respondent  failed  to  engage  with  the
      explanation given  for  the  amendment  to  the  tax  return  and  the
      conclusion that a professional accountant would not make such an error
      was irrational. The applicant had voluntarily amended his  tax  return
      and paid the tax due. His actions demonstrated that  his  presence  in
      the UK was not undesirable. The respondent applied to high a  standard
      of proof in considering the explanation and  had  failed  to  exercise
      discretion under paragraph 322(5) such that the refusal of  indefinite
      leave to remain was unlawful. Further, the respondent  ought  to  have
      invited  further  comment  prior  to  refusing  the  application.  The
      respondent had failed to explicitly allege dishonesty or deception and
      in any event the applicant had provided a plausible explanation.


   8. Permission was granted on the ground that, if the respondent  was  not
      asserting dishonesty,  it  was  difficult  to  see  what,  other  than
      negligence or significant carelessness, could  have  resulted  in  the
      discrepancies. It is arguable that significant carelessness,  if  that
      is what the respondent was actually asserting, does  not  fall  within
      the scope of  paragraph  322(5)  of  the  immigration  rules  and  the
      respondent acted unlawfully in relying on that provision.


Applicant's explanation for the discrepancies


   9. In his questionnaire the applicant  names  his  accountants  as  Oasis
      Accountants and gives their full address and postcode. He stated  that
      they prepared his self-assessment tax returns on five  occasions  from
      2010 to 2015 and his company tax returns for five years from  2012  to
      2017. He set out his turnover, expenses and net profit for each  year.
      The following questions and answers are relevant to this application.


  10. Question 12: Did you review, check and sign each tax return before  it
      was submitted and if not please list and give reason why?


           "I was undergoing lot of problems in family and was not able  to
           concentrate on this. Also my marriage was  fixed  on  26/02/2012
           and was really behind making the necessary arrangement. Moreover
           I was rushing to complete my official commitments before leaving
           to India for marriage. Hence given authorisation  to  accountant
           for filing the tax return. This was the reason  why  I  was  not
           able to verify the figures submitted by accountant. As soon as I
           realised the mismatch in figures, made amendments  to  2010-2011
           tax returns and started paying revised tax."


  11. Question  13:  Are  you  satisfied  that  the  tax  returns  submitted
      accurately reflected your income and if not state what further  action
      you have taken to address it?


           "The variation in incomes was in 2010-2011 which was brought  to
           my notice by early 2016 while checking previous tax  history.  I
           was undergoing lot of problems in  family  and  was  under  real
           stress. Also my marriage was fixed on 26/02/2012 and was  really
           behind making the necessary arrangement. Moreover I was  rushing
           to complete my official commitments before leaving to India  for
           marriage. Hence given authorisation to accountant for filing the
           tax return. This was the reason why I was not able to verify the
           figures submitted by accountant.  As  soon  as  I  realised  the
           mismatch in figures, made amendments to  2010-2011  tax  returns
           and started paying revised tax."


  12. Question 14(a) Please provide details  and  why  the  tax  return  was
      incorrectly submitted?


           "I was undergoing lot of problems in family and was  under  real
           stress. Also my marriage was fixed on 26/02/2012 and was  really
           behind making the necessary arrangement. Moreover I was  rushing
           to complete my official commitments before leaving to India  for
           marriage. Hence given authorisation to accountant for filing the
           tax return. This was the reason why I was not able to verify the
           figures submitted by accountant.  As  soon  as  I  realised  the
           mismatch in figures, made amendments to  2010-2011  tax  returns
           and started paying revised tax."


  13. Question 14(c) What was the cause of the error?


           "As I explained earlier, I was not able to verify the tax return
           at the time of filing. I was  going  through  a  lot  of  family
           problems and also my marriage was fixed in feb (sic) 2012. I was
           rushing to complete the necessary arrangements and was not  able
           to concentrate on this."


  14. In his unsigned and undated statement at H1 of the trial  bundle,  the
      applicant stated:


           "Tax difference issue had come into light as my  new  accountant
           was going through all my tax returns, and the reason  for  2010-
           2011 tax return discrepancy was due to  because  in  during  Jan
           2012 I was in the process of getting married  and  I  was  fully
           busy in doing marriage arrangements. As my parents are very old,
           I have to do all the arrangement from here and my  marriage  was
           held in India. We have invited over 1000 people therefore I  was
           totally busy arranging marriage hall  and  food  and  invitation
           therefore I was not able to check and sign the accounts prepared
           by my accountant.


           One of my staffs in Financial partners has made this  error  and
           he submitted on my behalf as he prepared my accounts for my Tier
           1 general  visa  and  I  was  in  the  impression  since  he  is
           submitting the same figures. He would do it accurately. However,
           the staff has made a mistake.


           I have been trying to  get  hold  of  the  staffs  in  Financial
           partners  when  my  new  accountant  identified.  However,   the
           financial partners was closed and I  found  in  companies  house
           they dissolved the company in October 2014. So I  am  unable  to
           get hold of any staffs. I am still in the process of  trying  to
           get hold of the staff or owner or get a letter of this error.


           So  due  to  my  marriage  circumstances   I   lost   track   of
           responsibilities. And I did sign the accounts in my tax  returns
           which was submitted by my old accountant.


           Hence, when my new accountant     spotted the mistake I gave the
           permission to rectify it and was ready to pay the difference  to
           HMRC And I have paid all the taxes in full."


Respondent's decisions


  15. In the refusal letter of 12 January 2018, the Respondent set  out  the
      answer to question 14(c) and stated:


           "Consideration has  been  given  to  the  explanation  provided.
           However, it  is  not  credible  that  a  competent  professional
           accountant would make such a fundamental  mistake  in  declaring
           taxes to HMRC. Your accountant would have prepared your accounts
           based on the evidence and information provided to  them  at  the
           time. Once they had produced the accounts, you would  have  been
           provided with a copy which you could check for any inaccuracies.
           It is therefore not accepted that you could have been unaware of
           the discrepancies between the  earnings  declared  to  UKVI  and
           HMRC.


           Therefore, the Secretary of State is satisfied  that  the  self-
           employed earnings you  had  declared  in  your  initial  Tier  1
           (General) application is not consistent  with  your  declaration
           made to HMRC in  the  relevant  tax  period.  Had  you  declared
           earnings which were consistent with your  declaration  to  HMRC,
           you  would  not  have  scored  sufficient   points   under   the
           Immigration Rules for leave to remain to be granted.


           The Secretary of State has  considered  whether  the  particular
           circumstances of your case merit  the  exercise  of  discretion.
           Having considered those circumstances the Secretary of State  is
           satisfied that  the  refusal  remains  appropriate  and  is  not
           prepared to exercise discretion in your favour."


  16. On administrative review,  dated  14  February  2018,  the  Respondent
      stated:


           "You claim that you did not intentionally sought to deceive  the
           Home Office or intentionally not provide accurate information to
           HMRC...


           The ultimate responsibility for the requirements lies with  you,
           as you are responsible for ensuring that when  the  tax  returns
           are submitted to HMRC the details  within  are  correct.  It  is
           additionally noted there would have  been  a  clear  benefit  to
           yourself either by under-reporting your  self-employed  earnings
           to HMRC and thereby reducing your tax  liability,  or  by  over-
           inflating your self-employed  earnings  in  order  to  meet  the
           threshold for points required as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant.  On
           review we are satisfied the  original  caseworker  has  assessed
           your application correctly and we have maintained  the  original
           decision.


           You raise AA  Nigeria  [2009]  EWCA  Civ  and  TR  (CCOL  cases)
           Pakistan [2011] UKUT    to  support  your  application,  arguing
           that you had no intention to deceive the Secretary of State.  On
           review the case laws are relating to  deception  being  used  to
           obtain leave of some form in the UK. However, this case  law  is
           not deemed relevant to your application as your application  has
           not been refused on deception but on character and conduct."


Applicable Law


  17. The relevant Immigration Rule in this case is paragraph  322(5)  which
      states:


           'Grounds on which leave to remain...should normally be refused


            (5)  The undesirability of permitting the person  concerned  to
                 remain in the  United  Kingdom  [considering  his  conduct]
                 (including convictions which do not fall  within  paragraph
                 322(1C), character or associations  or  the  fact  that  he
                 represents a threat to national security'.


  18. In the reported decision of R (Khan) v SSHD (Dishonesty,  tax  return,
      paragraph 322(5))  [2018]  UKUT  00384,  Martin  Spencer  J  gave  the
      following guidance:


        i) Where there has been a significant difference between the income
           claimed in a previous application for leave to  remain  and  the
           income declared to HMRC, the Secretary of State is  entitled  to
           draw an inference that  the  Applicant  has  been  deceitful  or
           dishonest  and  therefore  he  should  be  refused  ILR   within
           paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules.   Such  an  inference
           could be expected where there is no  plausible  explanation  for
           the discrepancy.


       ii) Where an Applicant has presented evidence to show that,  despite
           the prima facie inference, he was not in fact dishonest but only
           careless, then the Secretary of State must  decide  whether  the
           explanation and evidence is sufficient, in her view, to displace
           the prima facie inference of deceit/dishonesty.


      iii) In approaching that fact-finding task, the  Secretary  of  State
           should remind herself that, although the standard  of  proof  is
           the "balance of probability", a finding that a person  has  been
           deceitful and dishonest in relation to his tax affairs with  the
           consequence that he is denied settlement in this  country  is  a
           very serious finding with serious consequences.


       iv) For an Applicant simply to blame his or her  accountant  for  an
           "error" in relation to the historical tax return will not be the
           end of the matter, given that the accountant will or should have
           asked the tax payer to confirm that the return was accurate  and
           to have signed the tax return. Furthermore, the  Applicant  will
           have known of his or her earnings and will have expected to  pay
           tax thereon. If the Applicant  does  not  take  steps  within  a
           reasonable time to remedy the situation, the Secretary of  State
           may be entitled  to  conclude  that  this  failure  justifies  a
           conclusion that there has been deceit or dishonesty.


        v) When considering whether or not the Applicant  is  dishonest  or
           merely careless the  Secretary  of  State  should  consider  the
           following matters, inter alia, as well as the  extent  to  which
           they are evidenced (as opposed to asserted):


           i. Whether the explanation for the error by  the  accountant  is
              plausible;


          ii. Whether the documentation which can be assumed to exist  (for
              example,  correspondence  between  the  Applicant   and   his
              accountant at the time of the tax return) has been  disclosed
              or there is a plausible explanation for why it is missing;


         iii. Why the Applicant did not realise that an error had been made
              because his liability to pay tax was less than he should have
              expected;


          iv. Whether, at any stage,  the  Applicant  has  taken  steps  to
              remedy the situation and, if so, when those steps were  taken
              and the explanation for any significant delay.


Written Submissions


  19. In his skeleton argument, Mr Karim refined the grounds and submitted:


   i) The respondent's actions/decisions were  in  breach  of  the  Tameside
      duty;


  ii) The respondent's decisions were unlawful/irrational; and


 iii) The respondent's decisions amount to a disproportionate breach of  the
      applicant's Article 8 ECHR rights.


  20. It was submitted that the questionnaire was wholly inadequate and  the
      respondent should have interviewed the applicant and  contacted  HMRC.
      The threshold for the engagement of paragraph  322(5)  was  high.  The
      respondent must have reliable  and  cogent  evidence  and  give  clear
      precise reasons in support of  the  conclusion  that  the  applicant's
      presence in the UK was  undesirable.  The  respondent'  allegation  of
      deception was vague and in any event the applicant had  been  careless
      and not dishonest. The exercise of discretion was flawed  because  the
      respondent had failed to have regard to all factors and an  inadequate
      balancing assessment had been carried out. Lastly, the  applicant  had
      now made a human rights claim and he should be given  the  opportunity
      to give evidence at an appeal hearing in line with Khan v SSHD  [2018]
      EWCA Civ 1684.


  21. In the detailed grounds of defence, the respondent submitted that  the
      application was not refused under paragraph 322(2) and  therefore  the
      deception tests set out in AA Nigeria v SSHD [2009] EWCA Civ  773  did
      not apply. Under paragraph 322(5) the respondent did not need to  show
      who was deceived just that deception/dishonesty  had  occurred.  There
      was reliable evidence of sufficiently reprehensible conduct to justify
      the refusal under paragraph 322(5). The  respondent  properly  applied
      the guidance in R (Khan). An allegation of dishonesty was implicit  in
      a refusal under paragraph 322(5).


Application to amend the grounds


  22. Mr Karim submitted that the application to amend was not made  at  the
      eleventh hour. The applicant relied on Articles 6 and 8 at  section  4
      of the judicial  review  claim  form  and  in  the  skeleton  argument
      submitted two weeks before the hearing.  The  pragmatic  approach  was
      that agreed in the ETS case of  Khan  v  SSHD  [2018]  EWCA  Civ  1684
      whereby on appeal the applicant could advance evidence in response  to
      the respondent's allegation of dishonesty.


  23. Mr Bedford submitted that section 4 of the claim  form  did  not  give
      rise to a human rights claim. There were no particulars in the grounds
      and permission was not granted on this point. The  respondent  had  no
      opportunity to deal with it and it was an attempt  to  circumvent  the
      rules of public law.


  24. Mr Karim relied on paragraph 14 of Ahsan v SSHD [2017] EWCA  Civ  2009
      in which the respondent conceded that there was no statutory provision
      requiring an applicant to make a paid application.  The  human  rights
      claim had been raised in the claim form and the respondent  had  ample
      opportunity to deal with it.


  25. I refused the application to amend the grounds made on 21 January 2019
      for the following reasons. The applicant had not made  an  application
      for leave to remain on human rights grounds and stating that Article 8
      was relied  on  in  section  4  of  the  claim  form,  without  giving
      particulars in the grounds, was not sufficient. The  grounds  did  not
      rely on Article 8 and permission was not granted on  that  basis.  The
      statement relied on in the application to amend  was  not  before  the
      respondent at the time he made his decision to refuse indefinite leave
      to remain or  on  administrative  review.  In  the  interests  of  the
      overriding objective, I have regard to the comments by Singh LJ  in  R
      (Talpada) v SSHD [2018] EWCA 841 at paragraphs 67 to 69.


Applicant's submissions


  26. Mr Karim relied on  grounds  1  and  2  and  proceeded  to  make  oral
      submissions as follows: The ambit of paragraph  322(5)  was  wide  and
      even if dishonesty was found, the rule still required an assessment of
      whether the applicant's conduct was undesirable. The respondent's  own
      guidance indicated a high level of reprehensible behaviour  such  that
      it would be undesirable to allow a person to remain in the UK and  the
      consequences of a refusal under paragraph  322(5)  were  serious.  The
      rules required the respondent  to  conduct  two  balancing  exercises.
      Firstly, weighing  desirable  factors  against  undesirable  ones  and
      secondly, exercising discretion as  to  whether  the  rule  should  be
      invoked at all. There must be reliable evidence and the  threshold  of
      engagement was high.


      Ground 1


  27. Mr Karim submitted that the applicant  was  not  interviewed  and  the
      questionnaire was not sufficient to put the applicant on notice of  an
      allegation of dishonesty or deception. There was no reference  to  the
      respondent's concerns in the questionnaire or in  any  correspondence.
      Following R (Anjum) v ECO [2017] UKUT 00406 (IAC), the respondent  had
      adopted an inflexible approach and denied the applicant an opportunity
      to clarify the answers given in the questionnaire. In the  absence  of
      an interview the respondent should at least issue a 'minded to refuse'
      letter. The allegation was a serious one and should have been  put  to
      the applicant (R v SSHD ex parte Fayed [1998] 1 WLR 763 at 777B,  Lord
      Woolfe MR).


  28. Mr Karim submitted that the applicant did not know the respondent  was
      alleging deception because amending his tax return was not  sufficient
      to  lead  to  a  conclusion  of  dishonesty.  The  questionnaire   was
      inadequate. The allegation was not put in this case and the  applicant
      was not aware of the draconian consequences. He was not  able  to  put
      forward reasons for why his conduct was not undesirable because  there
      was no proper process in place. The respondent was not seized  of  all
      facts and information prior to making the decision.  It  was  apparent
      from the respondent's guidance that HMRC would  take  action  if  they
      suspected non-compliance. They had not done so and therefore they  had
      not been deceived. As part of his Tameside duty the respondent  should
      have made enquiries.


  29. In the decision to refuse indefinite  leave  to  remain  the  decision
      maker referred to errors but did not state that the applicant intended
      to deceive. In the administrative review decision, the decision  maker
      specifically stated that the  application  had  not  been  refused  on
      deception but on  character  and  conduct.  The  decision  makers  had
      wrongly assumed that amending a tax  return  was  sufficient  for  the
      application of paragraph 322(5) without the need for dishonesty.  This
      was a significant error and the decisions should be quashed.


  30. The applicant had amended his tax return and paid all tax due. He  had
      received no financial benefit. HMRC had taken no action and  were  not
      deceived. The respondent accepted the applicant's evidence  of  income
      in granting leave to remain in  2011.  There  was  no  suggestion  the
      applicant had submitted false documents.  The  respondent's  reasoning
      was fundamentally flawed.


  31. The applicant raised the issue  of  deception  in  his  administrative
      review and denied it. The respondent in the acknowledgement of service
      stated that he was not implying dishonesty and  has  now  changed  his
      position after the  grant  of  permission.  The  two  decisions  under
      challenge were contradictory and vitiated by public  law  errors.  The
      decision maker did not consider dishonesty or deception.


      Ground 2


  32. The decisions demonstrated that the error in the  tax  return  was  an
      innocent mistake not an act of  deception.  The  applicant  had  given
      substantial answers  in  his  questionnaire  and  the  respondent  had
      applied the wrong burden of proof in rejecting this explanation  which
      only had to be plausible  not  convincing.  The  decisions  failed  to
      engage with the explanation in  considering  whether  the  applicant's
      conduct was undesirable. There was a clear contradiction  between  the
      decision to refuse leave and the summary grounds of defence.


Respondent's submissions


  33. Mr Bedford submitted that the guidance in R (Khan) was  binding,  even
      though it could be distinguished on its facts. In  the  present  case,
      there  was  no  letter  from  the  applicant's  previous  or   current
      accountant. Mr Bedford accepted that carelessness was  not  enough  to
      engage paragraph 322(5). However, the discrepancy was  large  and  the
      amendment of the tax return was not made until four years  later.  The
      respondent had properly considered the applicant's explanation for the
      error in his tax return and concluded that it was not  credible.  This
      case was on all fours with R (Sultana) v SSHD (JR/10580/2017).


  34. The respondent did not accept that the applicant was  unaware  of  the
      discrepancies in self-employed income declared to UKVI  and  HMRC.  It
      was not relevant that HMRC had not taken any action. The  decision  to
      prosecute was different with a higher burden of proof.  There  was  no
      further information necessary for the respondent to reach  a  balanced
      conclusion. The respondent did  not  accept  the  applicant  had  been
      careless. The applicant's behaviour came within paragraph  322(5)  and
      it was not necessary for the respondent to  prove  which  of  the  two
      government departments had been deceived.  The  respondent  considered
      undesirability in the exercise of his discretion.


  35. Mr Bedford accepted that the paragraph in  the  administrative  review
      decision referring to AA Nigeria  was  ambiguous  but,  when  read  in
      context, the decision  maker  was  stating  that  this  case  was  not
      relevant because paragraph 322(1A) did not apply.  The  administrative
      review decision did not invalidate the initial refusal  of  indefinite
      leave to remain. The decision maker did appreciate that dishonesty was
      required and it was clear that the  applicant's  innocent  explanation
      was disbelieved.


  36. The applicant's statement at H1 of the trial bundle was not before the
      initial decision maker.  This  statement  was  inconsistent  with  the
      answers given in the questionnaire. There was no  statement  from  the
      either of the accountancy firms. Mr Bedford  submitted  that  even  if
      there was an error  in  the  decisions  under  challenge  it  made  no
      difference to the outcome and relief should be refused. There  was  no
      additional evidence which could lead to a different conclusion.


  37. The  applicant  was  not  taken  by  surprise  by  the  allegation  of
      dishonesty and was clearly aware of the need to  explain  why  he  had
      amended  his  tax  return.  There  was  no  requirement  to  put   the
      application on notice that his  explanation  had  not  been  accepted.
      There was no policy to offer an interview and it was  not  merited  in
      this case because the applicant had completed a questionnaire and  his
      explanation had not changed on administrative review.


Applicant's response


  38. Mr Karim submitted that R (Khan) was not binding but  he  accepted  it
      was  persuasive.  The  absence  of  a  letter  from  the   applicant's
      accountant was not  an  issue.  The  applicant  was  not  blaming  his
      accountant. He was stating that he was in a rush and unable to  verify
      his tax return. He had not provided his accountant  with  the  correct
      information. The respondent had failed to  properly  engage  with  the
      applicant's explanation and had applied  too  high  a  threshold.  The
      applicant's subsequent tax returns, submitted by the same  accountant,
      were accurate. His explanation  could  be  plausible.  The  respondent
      failed to assess desirability.


  39. The administrative review decision was flawed and should be set aside.
      The respondent's  concession  that  the  decision  was  ambiguous  was
      sufficient for the applicant's claim to succeed. The respondent failed
      to conduct a true and fair balancing exercise (R (Ngouh) v SSHD [2010]
      EWHC 2218 (Admin)). There was a clear allegation in Sultana that false
      information had been submitted. That was not clear from  the  language
      used in this case. The applicant was not aware of  the  allegation  of
      dishonesty and the respondent stated that he did not rely on it in the
      administrative review decision. This further undermined  the  decision
      making process. Section 31 of the  Senior  Courts  Act  1981  did  not
      apply. A discrepancy in a tax return was not necessarily dishonest and
      the respondent failed to conduct balancing exercise. Had he done so he
      may well have come to a different conclusion.


Discussion and conclusions


  40. It is not in dispute that the applicant failed to declare  �32,880  to
      HMRC in his self-assessment  tax  return  for  2010/2011.  This  is  a
      significant discrepancy capable of giving  rise  to  an  inference  of
      dishonesty. There is an  implicit  allegation  of  dishonesty  in  the
      application of paragraph 322(5). This is accepted at paragraph  33  of
      the applicant's grounds.


  41. It is  apparent  from  the  decision  of  12  January  2018  that  the
      respondent is alleging dishonesty because he does not accept that  the
      applicant's  accountant  could  have  made  such  a  mistake  and  the
      applicant was unaware of the discrepancies between  earnings  declared
      to UKVI and HMRC. There was no evidence before the respondent from the
      accountant or correspondence from the applicant at the time of the tax
      return. Applying R (Khan) the respondent was entitled  to  reject  the
      applicant's explanation.


  42. It is also apparent in the administrative  review  decision  that  the
      respondent is alleging the applicant either under reported  his  self-
      employed income to HMRC to reduce his tax liability or  over  inflated
      his self-employed income to meet the threshold for points required  as
      a Tier 1 (General) migrant. A clear allegation of  dishonesty  on  the
      facts. The statement that the application was not refused on deception
      but on character  and  conduct  was  with  reference  to  AA  Nigeria:
      mandatory refusals under paragraphs 322(1A) as opposed to the  refusal
      under paragraph 322(5) in this case.


  43.  Paragraph  11(e)  of  the  acknowledgment  of  service  states:  "The
      Respondent is not implying  dishonesty  or  deception,  but  that  the
      Applicant has been refused on character and  conduct."   However,  the
      detailed  grounds  of  defence  make  it  clear  this  was   not   the
      respondent's position. The refusal letter  and  administrative  review
      make a clear allegation that  the  applicant  has  failed  to  declare
      income to HMRC or inflated his income in his application for leave  to
      remain. The submission advanced in the acknowledgment of service  does
      not change this.


  44. The  standard  of  proof  for  paragraph  322(5)  is  the  balance  of
      probabilities and the burden  is  on  the  respondent.  The  applicant
      failed to declare income of �32,880 to HMRC for  the  year  2010/2011.
      This was a significant discrepancy. The applicant relied on income  of
      �37,150 in his application for leave to remain  made  in  March  2011.
      There was reliable evidence of dishonesty.


  45. On the  facts,  the  discrepancy  would  have  been  apparent  to  the
      applicant. His explanation that he was under too much stress  and  was
      too busy to check his tax return was rejected by the respondent as not
      credible. This conclusion was one which was  reasonably  open  to  the
      respondent on the material before  him  and  the  reasons  given  were
      adequate. The  respondent  was  entitled  to  reject  the  applicant's
      explanation for the discrepancy in relation  to  self-employed  income
      and draw an inference that the applicant was  deceitful  or  dishonest
      such that indefinite leave to remain should be refused under paragraph
      322(5).


  46. The applicant was aware of the reason for the discrepancy in  his  tax
      returns before he made his application for indefinite leave to remain.
      He amended his tax return in early 2016  and  applied  for  indefinite
      leave to  remain  in  July  2016.  There  was  no  obligation  on  the
      respondent to put the applicant  on  notice  of  something  which  was
      within the applicant's own knowledge. This was not  a  case  where  an
      applicant would be in real difficulty in doing himself justice  unless
      the area of concern was identified by notice.


  47. I am not persuaded that the refusal of indefinite leave to remain  was
      procedurally unfair because the respondent  failed  to  interview  the
      applicant and failed to act consistently with HMRC. The applicant  was
      aware of the discrepancies in his tax returns and the reason for those
      discrepancies at the time he made his application.  He  was  given  an
      opportunity to elaborate and explain in the questionnaire.


  48. The applicant's explanation is that his accountants submitted his  tax
      return and he did not verify it. The respondent did  not  accept  that
      the accountants would make such a  mistake.  There  was  no  plausible
      explanation for why there was no evidence from Oasis Accountants given
      that the applicant claimed they filed his company tax returns for  the
      year 2016/2017. The applicant was aware of the error in his tax return
      in early 2016, he made his application for indefinite leave to  remain
      in July 2016 and the questionnaire was submitted in May 2017.


  49.  If  the  applicant  was  claiming  that  he  inadvertently  gave  his
      accountants incorrect information, as submitted by Mr Karim, there was
      no plausible explanation before the respondent for how he was able  to
      claim income of �37,150 in March 2011 in his application for leave  to
      remain given that he now claims that his accountants assisted him with
      this application. The explanation put forward  does  not  explain  why
      there was such a significant difference. The applicant's statement  at
      H1 was not  before  the  respondent  and  was  inconsistent  with  the
      applicant's questionnaire. He named different accountants  and  stated
      that they closed in 2014.


  50. The applicant has paid  a  late  penalty  to  HMRC.  The  respondent's
      decision to apply paragraph 322(5) was not inconsistent  or  dependant
      on the action taken by HMRC.  The  respondent  considered  whether  to
      exercise  discretion  and  considered  the  evidence  as  a  whole  in
      concluding that the applicant's presence in the UK was not  desirable.
      There was no misapplication of paragraph 322(5).


  51. The respondent's  decision  to  refuse  indefinite  leave  to  remain,
      applying paragraph 322(5), was open to him on the material before  him
      at the time of the decision. The respondent gave adequate reasons  for
      why the explanation was not credible.


  52. Accordingly, I refuse this application. The decisions  of  12  January
      2018 and 14  February  2018  were  not  unlawful  or  irrational.  The
      application is dismissed.


  53. Mr Karim applied for permission to appeal to the Court  of  Appeal.  I
      refuse his  application  for  the  following  reasons.  There  was  no
      obligation on the respondent to put the allegation  of  dishonesty  to
      the applicant prior to the decision  to  refuse  indefinite  leave  to
      remain. The summary grounds of defence were not part of  the  decision
      making process. The applicant had ample opportunity to put  forward  a
      plausible  explanation  and  failed  to  do  so.  This  case  was  not
      comparable with Fayed (see paragraph 46 above). The applicant accepted
      he had under-declared income to HMRC. Their view was not  material  to
      the respondent's decision. The decision that the  applicant's  conduct
      was undesirable was open to the respondent on the evidence before him.
      The applicant's answers in his questionnaire were largely the same and
      the respondent engaged with his explanation.  The  applicant  did  not
      make a human rights claim in his application for indefinite  leave  to
      remain.


  54. I refuse permission to appeal to the Court  of  Appeal.  There  is  no
      arguable case that I have erred in law or there is some  other  reason
      that requires consideration by the Court of Appeal.


  55. The Applicant to pay the Respondent's costs  of  �8,434.  The  summary
      grounds of defence, at paragraph 11(e), were an  inaccurate  statement
      of the respondent's position and were not relied on  in  the  detailed
      grounds of defence.


  56. The circumstances do not justify a departure from Bahta v SSHD  [2011]
      EWCA 895 and M v Croydon BC [2012] EWCA Civ 595 that the  unsuccessful
      party will pay the costs of the successful party.  The  Respondent  is
      entitled to his reasonable costs.
