Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr I Jarvis, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms J Heybroek, instructed by Lloyds PR Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1. This is an appeal by the Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department
   (SSHD) against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal allowing Ms  Win's
   appeal against the respondent's decision to remove her  from  the  United
   Kingdom following the refusal of her application for leave to  remain  on
   grounds of long residence.

2. For the purposes of this decision,  I  shall  hereinafter  refer  to  the
   Secretary of State as  the  respondent  and  Ms  Win  as  the  appellant,
   reflecting their positions as they were in the appeal before  the  First-
   tier Tribunal.

3. The appellant is a citizen of Myanmar born on  5  June  1976.  She  first
   entered the United Kingdom on 12 October 2001 with leave to  enter  as  a
   student until 20 November  2002  and  was  subsequently  granted  further
   periods of leave  as  a  student,  a  participant  of  the  International
   Graduates Scheme and a Tier 1 Post-Study Migrant until 2 July 2010. On  2
   July 2010 she applied for further leave to remain as  a  Tier  1  General
   Migrant but her application was refused  on  27  July  2010.  Her  appeal
   against the decision was dismissed on 23 December 2010, on 13 April  2011
   permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was refused in the  First-tier
   Tribunal and, following a further application to the Upper  Tribunal  for
   permission to appeal, permission was refused on 14 July 2011.

4. On 22 August 2013 the appellant applied for indefinite  leave  to  remain
   on the basis of ten years' lawful residence. In her  application  it  was
   stated that she did not receive the refusal of permission  to  appeal  to
   the Upper Tribunal until 15 April 2013 as it was  incorrectly  served  on
   her. She had spent nearly 12 years in the United Kingdom by the time  she
   received the decision. The respondent  was  requested  to  disregard  the
   short period of overstaying from 28 days following  the  receipt  of  the
   Upper Tribunal's decision on 15 April 2013. It  was  submitted  that  the
   appellant had established  a  family  and  private  life  in  the  United
   Kingdom. She was in a relationship with a person with permanent residence
   in the United Kingdom  and  her  employer  was  happy  to  reinstate  her
   employment.

5. The respondent refused the appellant's application  on  14  October  2013
   and a decision was made the same day  for  her  removal  to  Myanmar.  In
   refusing her application the respondent considered that she was unable to
   meet the criteria in Appendix FM as her partner  had  only  discretionary
   leave until 22 February 2015 and was currently in Myanmar and she did not
   have any children. The  respondent  considered  that  the  appellant  was
   unable to meet the requirements of paragraph  276ADE.  She  had  not  had
   valid leave since the expiry of her leave to remain as  a  Tier  1  Post-
   Study Migrant on 2 July 2010 and it was considered reasonable for her  to
   continue her private life in Myanmar.

6. The appellant appealed against that decision and her appeal was heard  by
   First-tier Tribunal Judge Colvin on 24 March 2014. It was conceded before
   the judge on behalf of the appellant that she could not meet the ten year
   long residency rule and that the appeal was pursued  only  on  Article  8
   grounds. It was accepted that she could not meet the  requirements  under
   Appendix FM or paragraph 276ADE. However it was submitted  on  behalf  of
   the appellant that there was a level of exceptionality in her  case.  The
   judge noted that she had been in the United Kingdom  for  12�  years,  of
   which nine had been with valid leave, and that the delay  in  making  the
   current application was partly due to the decision of the Upper  Tribunal
   refusing permission to appeal against the First-tier Tribunal's  decision
   in her Tier 1 application having been wrongly served. She concluded  that
   there were compelling circumstances not sufficiently recognised under the
   new rules and on that basis she allowed the appeal  on  Article  8  human
   rights grounds.

7. Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was sought by  the  respondent
   on the grounds that the judge had failed to follow the approach in Nagre,
   R (on the application of) v Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department
   [2013] EWHC 720 and Gulshan (Article 8 - new Rules  -  correct  approach)
   Pakistan [2013] UKUT 640 and had failed to provide adequate  reasons  why
   the appellant's circumstances were compelling or exceptional.

8. Permission to appeal was granted on 6 May 2014.

Appeal Hearing

9. The appeal came before me on 15 July 2014.

10. After hearing submissions from both parties I advised them  that  in  my
   view the judge's decision contained material errors of law such  that  it
   could not stand. Although the judge was clearly  aware  of  the  body  of
   recent jurisprudence relevant to Article 8 and the new immigration rules,
   referring in particular to  Shahzad  (Art  8:  legitimate  aim)  Pakistan
   [2014] UKUT 85 and the endorsement in that case to the approach taken  in
   Gulshan, she did not appear to follow that approach. I do not agree  with
   Ms Heybroek's submission that the decision in MM (Lebanon) & Ors,  R  (on
   the application of) v Secretary of State for the Home Department  &  Anor
   [2014] EWCA Civ  985  dispensed  with  the  requirement  to  follow  that
   approach. The judge was clearly  aware  of  the  need  for  there  to  be
   arguably good grounds for granting leave outside the rules and for  there
   to be compelling circumstances  not  sufficiently  recognised  under  the
   rules. However the factors upon which she relied at paragraph 22  of  her
   determination as amounting to compelling circumstances amounted to little
   more  than  the  appellant's  length  of  residence,  which  was  already
   recognised by the rules, and the fact that she fell short of  ten  years'
   continuous residence by only a short period,  which  was  a  "near  miss"
   consideration.  It  is  clear  that  she  felt  sympathetic  towards  the
   appellant and that she let her sympathy cloud her judgment  with  respect
   to the correct approach to be taken to the evidence, reaching conclusions
   that were, as Mr Jarvis submitted, clearly at odds  with  the  principles
   set out in Patel & Ors v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department
   [2013] UKSC 72 and Nasim and others (Article 8) Pakistan [2014] UKUT 25.

11. Accordingly I set aside the judge's decision and  sought  the  views  of
   the parties with respect to re-making the decision. On the  basis  of  Ms
   Heybroek's confirmation that there was no further evidence to be produced
   in regard to the appellant's private life and that there was no change in
   circumstances since the First-tier Tribunal heard the appeal I considered
   there to be no reason why I could not re-make the  decision  myself  with
   the benefit of further submissions from both parties.

12.  Ms  Heybroek  submitted  that  the  appellant  had  had  a   legitimate
   expectation of being able to stay in the  United  Kingdom  when  she  was
   granted leave as a Tier 1 worker. She relied upon paragraph 33(ii) of the
   judgment of the Administrative Court in Nagre in  submitting  that  there
   were good grounds justifying the grant of leave to the appellant  outside
   the rules, given the strength of her ties to the United Kingdom  and  the
   roots she had put down here, which outweighed the ties  she  retained  to
   Myanmar. She submitted  that  those  ties  consisted  of  her  length  of
   residence here, her social and community ties, her involvement  with  the
   Buddhist temple and the friendships she had  formed  here.  She  had  not
   lived in Myanmar since 2001 and had made only three short visits to  that
   country since then. In response to my enquiry, Ms Heybroek confirmed that
   the appellant was no longer in a relationship.

13. Mr Jarvis submitted that the issue of legitimate expectation  was  dealt
   with in Nasim. He had nothing to add to the submissions  previously  made
   in regard to the error of law.

Consideration and Findings

14. It is accepted that the appellant cannot  meet  the  immigration  rules,
   either in terms of ten years' lawful residence or family and private life
   under Appendix FM and paragraph  276ADE.  Accordingly,  pursuant  to  the
   principles in Shahzad and Gulshan, unless there are arguably good grounds
   for granting leave outside the rules there is nothing further to consider
   in terms of Article 8.

15. I do  not  consider  that  such  arguably  good  grounds  exist  in  the
   appellant's case. The legitimate expectation argument in  relation  to  a
   previous grant of Tier 1 leave was comprehensively rejected in Nasim. The
   Court of Appeal in  Miah  &  Ors  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
   Department [2012] EWCA Civ 261 rejected the notion of a  "near-miss"  and
   accordingly nothing material arises from the shortfall in the appellant's
   period of ten  years'  lawful  residence.  Her  length  of  residence  is
   addressed within the terms of the rules as is the question of ties to her
   country of origin. Whilst the appellant has been in  the  United  Kingdom
   for over 12� years, the past four years have been without any leave.  She
   relies upon the three year  delay  caused  by  the  Tribunal's  error  in
   notifying her of the decision to refuse to grant permission to appeal  to
   the Upper Tribunal. However I find merit in Mr  Jarvis'  submission  that
   she was aware that her application for further leave  had  been  refused,
   that her appeal against that decision had been  dismissed  and  that  her
   application to the First-tier Tribunal for permission to  appeal  to  the
   Upper Tribunal had been refused. No explanation is given  as  to  why  it
   took the appellant so long to chase up the subsequent application to  the
   Upper Tribunal for permission to appeal and it is relevant to  note  from
   the decisions of 13 April 2011 and 14 July 2011 that there was  no  merit
   in any event in her grounds of appeal.

16. Ms Heybroek relied upon paragraph 33(ii) of the judgment in Nagre  which
   provided for circumstances where the ties to the United Kingdom  and  the
   roots established here were so strong as to manifestly outweigh the  ties
   to the country of origin even in cases of adults who had resided  in  the
   United Kingdom for less than 20 years and who had retained some  ties  to
   their country. However I do not find that  that  is  the  case  with  the
   appellant. She has no family ties to the United Kingdom. Her relationship
   with her partner has ended. Although she  claims  to  have  an  offer  of
   employment from her previous employer if she was granted leave to  remain
   there is no evidence to that effect. She is not currently employed.   The
   evidence of her ties to the United Kingdom is extremely thin and consists
   of no more than details of a meditation programme followed at a  Buddhist
   temple and her own,  unsupported,  statement  as  to  relationships  with
   friends and colleagues. Her ties to Myanmar, however,  consist  of  close
   family ties, namely  her  parents  and  two  married  sisters  and  their
   children, as well as cultural and linguistic ties. Although she claims to
   have only visited Myanmar three times since leaving there in 2001, it  is
   clear that she retains significant ties to that country.  Accordingly  it
   seems to me that there are no arguably good grounds  for  granting  leave
   outside the rules and there is therefore nothing further to consider  for
   the purposes of Article 8.

17. However, for the sake of completeness,  going  on  to  consider  whether
   compelling circumstances exist outside the rules I find  that  there  are
   none, for the same reasons  as  considered  above.  Whilst  Judge  Colvin
   referred to the appellant being well integrated into the  United  Kingdom
   there is, as I have said, very limited evidence to support such  a  view.
   The other factors relied upon by  the  appellant,  and  endorsed  by  the
   judge, such as the  appellant's  good  character  and  residence  without
   breaching the immigration rules, consist of no more than those considered
   in Nasim as not carrying weight in enhancing a person's human rights.

18. In all the circumstances I find that the appellant's  removal  from  the
   United Kingdom would not be disproportionate to  the  legitimate  aim  of
   maintaining an effective immigration control and would not be  in  breach
   of Article 8 of the ECHR.

DECISION

19. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved an  error
   on a point of law. The Secretary of State's appeal is accordingly allowed
   and the decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside. I  re-make  the
   decision by dismissing Ms Win's appeal on all grounds.
