Representation:
For the appellant:     Mr Matthew Moriarty of Counsel, instructed by
                    Everest Law Solicitors
For the respondent:    Ms Susana Cunha, a Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals with permission from the decision of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal dismissing his appeal against the  respondent's  decision
    on 15 November 2018 to refuse him entry clearance to  join  his  father
    and step-mother in the United Kingdom.  The appellant is a  citizen  of
    Nepal, an adult son of a  former  Gurkha  who  settled  in  the  United
    Kingdom, with the appellant's step-mother, in 2014.

 2. Mode of hearing.  The hearing today took place remotely  by  Skype  for
    Business.  There were no technical difficulties.  I am  satisfied  that
    all parties were in a quiet and private place and that the hearing  was
    completed fairly, with the cooperation of both representatives.

 3. The appellant is aged 47.   He accepts that  he  cannot  bring  himself
    within Annex K.  he relies on his family life under Article 8 ECHR.

 4. On the respondent's behalf, Ms  Cunha  accepted  at  the  hearing  that
    financial dependency had been demonstrated but argued that the evidence
    of emotional dependency was not sufficient.  However, she accepted that
    if family life were found, and Article 8(1) engaged, then having regard
    to the historic injustice to former Gurkha soldiers and their families,
    such a finding would be determinative of the appeal in  favour  of  the
    appellant.

 5. The First-tier Judge found the appellant's father and step-mother to be
    unreliable witnesses, whose accounts changed  several  times  and  were
    contradictory. However, it was common  ground,  having  looked  at  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal and the documents which were before
    the First-tier Judge, that he failed to engage with a very  significant
    number of documents, the parents' passports showing at least  two  long
    visits by the appellant's father and step-mother to Nepal, in 2017  and
    2019,  and  bank  statements  and  other  financial  evidence  of  very
    substantial payments to him made during those visits.  There were  also
    numerous telephone cards and Viber conversations.

 6. I am satisfied that the First-tier Judge made an error of fact  at  the
    level of an error of law in overlooking that evidence, and also that in
    applying the negative view he had formed of the  parents'  evidence  to
    the documentary evidence  which  he  did  consider,  he  committed  the
    Mibanga error.  There was no question but that the decision would  have
    to be set aside and remade.

 7. I therefore proceeded to remake the decision at the hearing.  The  core
    account is that the appellant's parents (that is to say, his father and
    his second wife, the  appellant's  step-mother)  moved  to  the  United
    Kingdom in 2014.  Before leaving, they set  up  the  appellant  with  a
    general store and left him in a large home, hoping that he  would  make
    himself independent.

 8. The evidence of both parents was that the appellant had  never  worked.
    He does have two uncles locally, who are farmers, and  two  sisters  in
    Nepal.  The appellant has produced a certificate that he is single, and
    another  certificate  that  he  is  unemployed,  neither  of  which  is
    challenged in the refusal decision and on which his  parents  were  not
    cross-examined in the First-tier Tribunal.   Those  documents  must  be
    regarded as reliable.

 9. The general shop failed.  In 2017, when the appellant's parents came to
    visit, they gave him over ï¿½23000, partly to pay off the debts the  shop
    had incurred, and partly to support him in the future.   The  appellant
    also had access to his father's Nepalese Gurkha pension account.    The
    telephone cards and Viber messages indicate substantial contact between
    the parents and the appellant in Nepal, and again, they were not cross-
    examined on those documents in the First-tier Tribunal.

10. The test of dependency in a historical injustice case  is  set  out  in
    Patel, Modha & Odedra v Entry Clearance Officer  (Mumbai)  [2010]  EWCA
    Civ 17 (25 January 2010) at [14] in the judgment of Lord Justice Sedley
    (with whom Lord Justice Longmore and Lord Justice Aikens agreed):

         "14. You can set out to compensate for a historical wrong, but  you
         cannot reverse the passage of time. Many of these children have now
         grown up and embarked  on  lives  of  their  own.  Where  this  has
         happened, the bonds which constitute family life will no longer  be
         there, and art. 8 will have no purchase. But what may constitute an
         extant family life falls well short of what constitutes dependency,
         and a good many adult children - including  children  on  whom  the
         parents themselves are now reliant - may still have a  family  life
         with parents who are now settled here not by leave or by  force  of
         circumstance but by long-delayed right.  That  is  what  gives  the
         historical wrong a potential relevance to art.  8  claims  such  as
         these. It does not make the Convention a mechanism for turning  the
         clock back, but it does make both  the  history  and  its  admitted
         injustices potentially relevant to the application of art. 8(2). "

11. In Ghising (family life - adults - Gurkha policy) Nepal [2012] UKUT 160
    (IAC) (11 April 2012, the Upper Tribunal held  that  the  Article  8(1)
    issue is highly fact-sensitive:

         "62. The different outcomes in  cases  with  superficially  similar
         features emphasises to us that the  issue  under  Article  8(1)  is
         highly fact-sensitive.  In our judgment,  rather  than  applying  a
         blanket rule with regard to adult children,  each  case  should  be
         analysed on its own facts, to decide whether  or  not  family  life
         exists, within the meaning of Article 8(1). As Wall  LJ  explained,
         in the context of family life between adult siblings:

             "We do not think that Advic is authority for  the  proposition
             that Article 8 of the Human Rights  Convention  can  never  be
             engaged when the family life it is sought to establish is that
             between adult siblings living together. In our  judgment,  the
             recognition in Advic that,  whilst  some  generalisations  are
             possible, each case is fact-sensitive places an obligation  on
             both Adjudicators and the IAT to identify the  nature  of  the
             family life  asserted,  and  to  explain,  quite  shortly  and
             succinctly, why it is that Article 8 is or is not engaged in a
             given case."  (Senthuran v Secretary of  State  for  the  Home
             Department [2004] EWCA Civ 950)."

12. The relevant factual matrix here is that the appellant lived  with  his
    parents (first his father and his mother, and later his father and  his
    step-mother) all of the time they lived in Nepal, and that since  then,
    they have provided for him and been in regular telephone  contact  with
    him, as well as two long visits to sort out his finances and  reconnect
    with him and, no doubt, the extended family of his siblings and uncles.
     He lives in a large house with spare bedrooms which are unused, except
    during those visits.  He relies on his  father's  Gurkha  pension,  and
    large sums of money which his father gives him when he visits.

13. The respondent does not dispute  financial  dependence,  and  there  is
    sufficient evidence of  emotional  dependence  also  in  the  documents
    before the Tribunal.  The appellant  and  his  father  and  step-mother
    remain a close knit family, despite the distance. He does not work  and
    is a single man.

14. I am satisfied that Article  8  (1)  is  engaged.   By  reason  of  the
    concession made by Ms Cunha that  if  Article  8(1)  was  engaged,  the
    appellant's claim should succeed, I need go no further than that.

15.  The  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  is  set  aside  and  the
    appellant's appeal against the refusal of entry clearance allowed.



DECISION

16. For the foregoing reasons, my decision is as follows:

    The making of the previous decision involved the making of an error  on
    a point of law.

    I set aside the previous decision.  I remake the decision  by  allowing
    the appellant's appeal.
