Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr I Ali (Counsel)
For the Respondent:    Miss J Isherwood (HOPO)


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal against a determination of First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    Thomas, promulgated on  4th  December  2014,  following  a  hearing  at
    Birmingham on 19th November 2014.   In  the  determination,  the  judge
    dismissed the appeals of Kousar Younis, Waqar  Younis,  Danish  Younis,
    and Attia Younis.  The Appellants subsequently applied  for,  and  were
    granted, permission to appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal,  and  thus  the
    matter comes before me.

The Appellants

 2. The Appellants comprise a family of a mother and  her  children.   They
    are all citizens of Pakistan.  They were born respectively on 4th  June
    1971, on 4th November 1995, on 4th November 1995, and on  2nd  December
    1996.  The second  and  third  Appellants  are  twins.   They  appealed
    against the decision of the Respondent Entry  Clearance  Officer  dated
    23rd January 2014, refusing their application for  entry  clearance  to
    join the husband  of  the  first  Appellant,  and  the  father  of  the
    remaining Appellants, Mr Mohammed Sahir, a person present  and  settled
    in the UK.

The Appellants' Claim

 3. The Appellants' claim is that  the  first  Appellant  and  the  Sponsor
    married on 1st April 1982.  They have been married for 22 years.  There
    is a marriage certificate.  There is a video recording  of  the  event.
    The second and third Appellants are twins and were  born  on  4th  June
    1995.  The fourth Appellant was born on 2nd December  1996.   They  are
    all children of the marriage.  They all live together in Pakistan.  The
    Sponsor has maintained contact with all of them.  There  has  been  one
    visit by the Sponsor.  The Sponsor's marriage was arranged.  He is  now
    a British citizen.  However, when  he first came  to  the  UK  on  15th
    March 1996, he had applied for asylum and this was rejected, and he was
    only granted indefinite  leave  to  remain,  and  eventually  became  a
    naturalised citizen in  2013.   He  has  maintained  contact  with  the
    Appellants.  He has visited them  once  in  July  2014,  after  he  had
    acquired legal citizen in the UK.  He stayed for three weeks then.   He
    uses telephone cards to call them.  He works for Twin Plastics Ltd as a
    machine operator.  He has a 50% share in  a  fast  food  company.   His
    marriage with the first Appellant is genuine and subsisting.  He  loves
    his wife and children and wants to be reunited with them.  His position
    is that, "there will be no reason for him to send money to his wife  if
    his relationship was not ongoing, genuine  and  subsisting"  (paragraph
    6).

The Judge's Findings

 4. The judge was satisfied that the parties were married on 1st April 1992
    as claimed.  There was no issue that the first Appellant was the mother
    of the remaining Appellants.  The judge observed how the  Sponsor  left
    Pakistan soon after the conception  of  his  third  child,  the  fourth
    Appellant (see paragraph 16).  There  were  birth  certificates,  which
    were  not  original,  but  they  "do  carry  some  evidential   weight"
    (paragraph 16).  The judge also observed that, "there is no issue  that
    the Sponsor has remitted funds to the first Appellant over  the  years"
    (paragraph 16).  There had been evidence from a Dr  Rehman  before  the
    judge, and the judge observed that, "I also accept the evidence  of  Dr
    Rehman that he has in the past taken  gifts from  the  Sponsor  to  the
    Appellants" (paragraph 16).

 5. However, the judge then went on to hold that, the fact that  the  three
    children existed "indicates that the matrimonial  relationship  existed
    from 1992 until 1996 when the  Sponsor  came  to  the  United  Kingdom"
    (paragraph 17) but it could not be said that  it  existed  beyond  this
    time without further evidence.  There was no evidence at all  from  the
    first Appellant to confirm the existence of the marital relationship or
    her intentions.  The judge observed that, "whilst I accept that she  is
    illiterate and has dyslexia, I  note  from  her  application  that  she
    speaks  Mirpuri  and  Urdu  well"  (paragraph  23).   The  appeal   was
    dismissed.

Grounds of Application

 6. The grounds of application state that the judge erred  in  her  finding
    that the marriage did not subsist and that there was  no  intention  to
    live together permanently given the weight of the evidence before  her.
    The Sponsor had given evidence that he had returned back  to  Pakistan,
    after he had got legal status in the UK, and lived as man and wife with
    the first Appellant on that occasion.  Furthermore, there  was  also  a
    discrepancy in the judge's conclusions at paragraph 24, where the judge
    held that the marriage does not subsist under  the  Immigration  Rules,
    and what she concluded later at paragraph 30, namely, that family  life
    could continue by the Sponsor  rejoining  his  wife  and  children   in
    Pakistan.

 7. On 2nd February 2015, permission to appeal was granted.

 8. On 13th February 2015, a Rule 24 response was entered.

Submissions

 9. In  his  submissions  before  me,  Mr  Ali,  appearing  on  behalf  the
    Appellants, relied  upon  his  well  crafted  skeleton  argument.   The
    principle point here was that the had failed to abide by the strictures
    in Goudey (subsisting marriage -  evidence)  Sudan  [2012]  UKUT  00041
    (IAC).  In this case, the President of the Tribunal  gave  judgment  to
    the following effect:

         "It may  be  that  the  ECO  and  the  judge  considered  that  the
         requirement to show a "against subsisting  marriage"  imposes  some
         significant burden to produce  evidence  other  that  showing  that
         there was a genuine intention to live together as man and wife in a
         married relationship.  If so we conclude that is an error  of  law.
         The authority of GA ("subsisting" marriage) Ghana [2006] Imm AR 453
         only requires that there is a real relationship as opposed  to  the
         merely formal one of a marriage which has not  been  determinative.
         Where there is a legally recognised marriage and  the  parties  who
         are living part both want to  be  together  and  live  together  as
         husband  and  wife,  we  cannot  see  that  more  is  required   to
         demonstrate that the marriage  is  subsisting  and  thus  qualifies
         under the Immigration Rules".

10. For her part, Miss Isherwood submitted that given that  the  Appellant,
    after the failure of his asylum  claim,  did  not  leave  the  UK  (see
    paragraph 18) the absence of eighteen years  away  from  his  wife  and
    family, was a matter that the judge could ask for further evidence  on,
    as proof for the  existence  of  a  genuine  and  subsisting  marriage.
    Furthermore, whereas the Sponsor was sending monies, it is by no  means
    clear that he was sending the money to the children alone,  or  to  his
    wife as well.  The essential basis of the decision here  was  that  the
    marriage was not genuine and subsisting  any  longer.   The  judge  was
    entitled to so conclude.

11. In reply, Mr Ali submitted that there was no way in which  the  judge's
    findings at paragraph 31 could  be  reconciled  with  the  findings  at
    paragraph 25.  In the latter, the judge had said that family life could
    be continued in Pakistan.  In the  former,  she  had  denied  the  very
    existence of family life.

12. Second, it was wrong to  say  (at  paragraph  23)  that  "there  is  no
    evidence at all from the first Appellant to confirm the existence of  a
    marital relationship or her  intentions".   The  judge  had  completely
    overlooked the witness statements of the parties.  These made it  quite
    clear that a German married life was intended.  Moreover,  at  question
    1.18 of Appendix 2 of the VAF application form, the Appellant makes  it
    clear that her intention is to live  permanently  with  the  Appellant.
    These facts alone suffice for the purposes of the Tribunal decision  in
    Goudey.  The judge was wrong to have overlooked the importance of  that
    decision.

13. Third, the judge's reasoning is irrational in other respects.   On  the
    same facts, the judge finds the relationship and  tie  of  the  Sponsor
    with his children to be a genuine and subsisting one.  Yet, on the same
    facts again, he finds the relationship and tie with his wife, the first
    Appellant, who had borne him three children, to be baseless.

14. There were two additional facts which were of great importance.  First,
    the judge concluded that there were "evidence of financial  remittances
    from the Sponsor".  She went on to say that, "there is indeed  evidence
    of such remittances from September 2012 to date"  (see  paragraph  20).
    This showed the Sponsor's commitment to his family.  Mr  Ali  submitted
    that he had  actually  worked  out,  from  the  remittances  that  were
    submitted, the funds that the Sponsor had over  the  two  year  period,
    sent to his family, and they amounted to no less than �16,000,  a  very
    substantial sum.  Second, the remittances were all in his wife's  name.
    It did not make sense for him to send the money to  his  wife,  if  his
    relationship with her had broken down, and it was  not  a  genuine  and
    subsisting one.  The judge also states that it is not  clear  what  the
    parties talk about.   She  accepts  that  "the  Sponsor  has  telephone
    contact with the Appellants" (paragraph 21) but that "the Sponsor gives
    no evidence of the content  of  conversations"  (paragraph  21).   This
    could simply not be  true  because  at  paragraph  14  of  the  witness
    statement the nature of the relationship is fully described.  The judge
    had overlooked this.

Error of Law

15. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  involved
    the making of an error on a point of law (see  Section  12(1)  of  TCEA
    2007) such that  I  should  set  aside  the  decision  and  remake  the
    decision.  My reasons are  as  follows.   The  judge  at  paragraph  30
    implies that there is a  distinction  between  British  citizenship  at
    birth and British citizenship acquired by naturalisation.  This follows
    from the observation that, "in the same way that he chose to leave  his
    family and move to the United Kingdom, there is nothing preventing  him
    from returning to live with his family in Pakistan now.  He  is  not  a
    British citizen by birth and is therefore able to  rejoin  his  family"
    (paragraph 30).  To say so is not only not based on  law,  but  defeats
    the application of Article 8 jurisprudence  in  appropriate  cases,  as
    there will be an implication here that any person not a British citizen
    otherwise than birth, can return back to the country of his origin.

16. Second, the suggestion at paragraph  30  that  a  family  life  can  be
    continued in  Pakistan  abroad,  runs  counter  to  the  conclusion  at
    paragraph 24 earlier  that,  "whilst  the  Appellant  and  Sponsor  are
    married and have three  children,  the  evidence  does  not  prove,  as
    required, in line with the case of GA, that  the  marital  relationship
    subsists and that the parties intend to live  together  permanently  in
    the  United  Kingdom".   The  two  conclusions  in  the  two   separate
    paragraphs are discordant and therefore amount to an error of law.

Re-Making the Decision

17. I have remade the decision on the basis of the decision of the original
    judge, the evidence that I have heard today, and the submissions before
    me.  I am allowing this appeal for the reasons given by Mr Ali  in  his
    clear and succinct submissions.  On any view, this is a case where  the
    Sponsor has regular contact with his family, which includes the contact
    with the first Appellant, his wife.  The  evidence  is  clear  on  this
    point and was accepted by the original judge when she observed that, "I
    accept that the Sponsor  is  still  in  contact  with  the  Appellants"
    (paragraph 21).  It is not true  that  there  is  no  evidence  of  the
    content of the conversations because this is set out in paragraph 14 of
    the witness statement of the Sponsor.

18. Second, there is acceptance that from 1996 onwards the Sponsor has been
    supporting his family.  There is evidence of remittances from September
    2012 to date and these remittances are all in the  name  of  the  first
    Appellant, the Sponsor's wife.

19. Third, the couple have been married for 22 years.  There is no rule  of
    law that a period away in the  UK,  for  a  couple  who  are  otherwise
    married and have children, imports a presumption that the marriage  has
    thereby broken down, with no intention to  live  permanently  together.
    In the very nature of things, where a person is an economic migrant, as
    has been  the  implication  here,  there  will  be  a  period  of  long
    separation, until such time, should it ever arise, that the person away
    in the United Kingdom acquires legal status.

20. The presumption is, if anything, the other way as demonstrated  by  the
    present decision in Goudey which confirms that all that is required  is
    a real relationship as opposed to a merely formal one, and where  there
    is a legal recognised marriage, and the parties are living  apart,  and
    both want to be together, and to live together  as  husband  and  wife,
    nothing more is required to demonstrate that the  marriage  is  genuine
    and subsisting.

21. Fourth, there are three children of the marriage.

22. Fifth, the Sponsor sends, not  just  monies,  but  gifts  as  well,  as
    confirmed by Dr Rehman.

23. Sixth, it is not clear why the evidence of the Sponsor, given and taken
    at face value, is not credible.  The evidence is credible because it is
    perfectly consistent with every other action that  he  has  taken  with
    respect to his wife and family.  The Appellants only  have  to  satisfy
    the Tribunal on a balance of probabilities.  This they have done.   The
    appeal is allowed.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an  error  of
law such that it falls to be set aside.  I set aside  the  decision  of  the
original judge.  I remake the decision as follows.  This appeal  is  allowed
under paragraphs EC-P.1.1(d) and E-ECP2.6 and  E-ECP2.10  (Appendix  FM)  of
the Immigration Rules.

No anonymity direction is made.
