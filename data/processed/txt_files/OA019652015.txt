Representation
For the Appellant:     Mr S. Whitwell, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:     Ms S. Alban, instructed by Sultan Lloyd Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1. The respondent (hereinafter "the claimant") is a citizen of Pakistan
   born on 11 March 1986. On 10 September 2014 she applied for entry
   clearance as the partner of a British citizen ("hereinafter "the
   sponsor"). Her application was refused by the appellant (hereinafter "the
   ECO") on the basis that certain required evidence concerning the
   sponsor's income from self employment was not submitted.


2. Upon review by the Entry Clearance Manager, it was accepted that all the
   required evidence was submitted. However, the decision to refuse entry
   clearance was maintained on the grounds that the bank statements
   submitted by the claimant showed the sponsor's income was below the
   required threshold.


3. The claimant's appeal came before First-tier Tribunal Judge Colyer.
   Allowing the appeal, the judge found that the sponsor is a self employed
   driver who earned, and paid tax on, a gross income of �19,005 in the
   2013/14 financial year. This sum exceeds the requirement under the
   Immigration Rules to earn at least �18,600 per year.


4. The judge found that the sponsor's bank statements over the 2013/14
   financial year show a total of only �7,545.58 being deposited. The judge
   found that the discrepancy between the sponsor's taxable income and the
   amount deposited into his account is because the sponsor earns most of
   his income in cash and uses much of this without depositing it. The judge
   was satisfied that the evidence showed the sponsor earned �19,005 which
   was a sum that was sufficient to meet the financial requirement in
   Appendix FM.


5. At paragraph [28] the judge quoted paragraph 7(f) of Appendix FM-SE
   (although he misstated the paragraph), which stipulates that a self
   employed person must, inter alia, provide:


         (f) personal bank statements for the same 12-month period as the
         tax return(s) showing that the income from self-employment has been
         paid into an account in the name of the person or in the name of
         the person and their partner jointly.


6. At paragraph [29] the judge stated that this requirement does not
   specify that all of the income must be paid into a personal bank account
   and that it was sufficient if, as in this case, only some of the
   sponsor's income was paid into an account as demonstrated by bank
   statements.

Grounds of appeal and submissions

7. The grounds of appeal argue that judge erred by failing to recognise
   that it is a requirement under paragraph 1(n) of Appendix FM-SE that only
   wages paid into a bank account can be counted.


8. The grounds make no mention of paragraph 7(f) of Appendix FM-SE or the
   judge's analysis of this provision at paragraphs [28] and [29] of the
   decision.


9. In granting permission to appeal, First Tier Tribunal Judge Baker
   referred to, and found an arguable error of law in respect of, the
   judge's interpretation of paragraph 7(f) notwithstanding that this was
   not raised in the grounds of appeal.


10. Mr Whitwell argued that the judge had conflated the rules regarding
   required income and the evidence necessary to substantiate that income.
   He submitted that the wording of paragraph 1(n) makes clear that where
   earnings and deposits do not match, only the amount deposited can be
   taken into consideration. I asked Mr Whitwell whether he intended to
   pursue an argument in respect of paragraph 7(f) and he declined to do so,
   contending that his assessment of paragraph 1(n) is sufficient to dispose
   of the matter.


11. Ms Alban argued that Mr Whitwell's argument is based on a
   misinterpretation of paragraph 1(n), as this paragraph does not apply to
   income from self employment. In respect of paragraph 7(f), she argued
   that if the clause was meant to require all income to be deposited it
   would have said "all of the income" rather than "the income".

Consideration

12. Appendix FM-SE stipulates the form of evidence required to substantiate
   claims that the substantive financial requirements under Appendix FM have
   been met.


13. Appendix FM-SE is detailed and prescriptive. It delineates three
   different categories of income and specifies the evidence necessary in
   respect of each. These are: (1) income as an employee/from salaried
   employment (paragraphs 2-6 of Appendix FM-SE); (2) self employment income
   (paragraphs 7-9); and (3) non employment income.


14. Paragraph 1 of Appendix FM-SE sets out a range of general requirements.
   One of the general requirements is that specified at paragraph 1(n) which
   provides as follows:

      The gross amount of any cash income may be counted where the person's
      specified bank statements show the net amount which relates to the
      gross amount shown on their payslips (or in the relevant specified
      evidence provided in addition to the specified bank statements in
      relation to non-employment income). Otherwise, only the net amount
      shown on the specified bank statements may be counted. [emphasis
      added]


15. In interpreting paragraph 1(n) I have not sought to ascertain (or
   surmise) what the Secretary of State's policy considerations may have
   been in formulating the paragraph. Rather, I have looked at the language
   used and given that language its natural and ordinary meaning. See Ahmed
   Mahad [2009] UKSC 16 at [10].


16. In my view, a plain reading of paragraph 1(n) leads to the inescapable
   (although perhaps surprising) conclusion that the paragraph is not
   applicable to income from self employment. The paragraph starts by
   stipulating that "bank statements [must] show the net amount which
   relates to the gross amount shown on their payslips". This cannot be
   meant to apply to income from self employment as, firstly, there would
   not be any payslips for a self employed person and, secondly, the amount
   deposited would ordinarily be the gross income rather than a net amount
   corresponding to the gross income. Moreover, payslips are not part of the
   evidence applicable in respect of self employed applicants. Paragraph
   1(n) then gives an alternative, which concerns "non employment income".
   It states that the gross amount of cash income may be counted where the
   statements show the net amount that relates to non employment income.
   Self-evidently, this alternative applies to "non employment income".


17. Paragraph 1(n) stipulates requirements that apply in respect of
   employment income and non employment income. However, it is silent in
   respect of self employment income.  For paragraph 1(n) to apply to self
   employment income it would either have to say so (which it does not) or
   be drafted in a broad way that would encompass self employment income
   (which it also does not).


18. This appeal concerned evidence of income from self employment. As
   paragraph 1(n) is only applicable in respect of income from employment
   and income from non-employment, no error of law arises from the judge's
   failure to give it consideration.


19. The grant of permission raises the question of whether the judge erred
   in his interpretation of paragraph 7(f) of Appendix FM-SE. However, this
   was not included in the grounds of appeal or pursued by Mr Whitwell at
   the error of law hearing. There is therefore no basis for me to address
   that issue. The only matter before me was whether the judge erred by
   failing to apply paragraph 1(n). For the reasons I have given, I am
   satisfied that he did not.

Decision

20. The appeal is dismissed.  The grounds of appeal do not identify a
   material error of law and the decision of the First-tier Tribunal shall
   stand.
