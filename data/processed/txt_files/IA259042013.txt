Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr A Miah, Counsel, instructed by Sony Sadaf Haroon
                    Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr J Singh, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by a citizen of Bangladesh against the decision of the
    First-tier Tribunal dismissing his appeal against  a  decision  refusing
    him further leave to remain in the United Kingdom.  His case is that his
    circumstances have changed and he has married  in  the  United  Kingdom.
    The respondent decided that he did not  meet  the  requirements  of  the
    Rules because he and his wife  between  them  did  not  earn  sufficient
    money.

 2. There are crucial findings at paragraph 33 of  the  determination  which
    have not been challenged before me. They are  to  the  effect  that  the
    parties did not earn the �18,600 required by the Rules but they did earn
    a significant amount of money and certainly in excess of the  figure  of
    �13,500 identified by Mr Justice Blake in the decision of MM and  Others
    v SSHD [2013] EWHC 1900 (Admin) as an approximation of the sum needed to
    live in the United Kingdom.

 3. I have to say that it is quiet clear that the  First-tier  Tribunal  did
    err in law. It is  plain  beyond  argument  because  the  Tribunal  said
    expressly at paragraph of 20 of the determination that the appellant was
    relying on the decision in MM but although this was acknowledged in  the
    determination there is no finding at all about the impact of MM.   There
    really should have been. The decision in MM is not  strictly  a  binding
    decision as it is a decision of the Administrative Court, albeit made by
    a High Court Judge with particular experience of immigration matters. If
    the First-tier Tribunal wanted to rely on MM it  should  have  explained
    clearly what, exactly, it thought that MM decided and how it  should  be
    applied.

 4. I also find it plain, although this was not raised in the grounds,  that
    the First-tier Tribunal Judge erred at paragraph 40 of the determination
    when he found that it would be reasonable  to  conclude  that  with  the
    passage of time the appellant's wife and baby would be able to travel to
    Bangladesh.  As a statement of fact this may very well be right  but  it
    rather misses the point that when determining human  rights  claims  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge should have decided the case in the  light  of
    the facts extant when he made his decision. It may very well be  thought
    that it is not reasonable to expect a woman who is seven months pregnant
    to travel to Bangladesh. Indeed it is not easy to  see  how  that  could
    practically be achieved without going to quite extraordinary means  such
    as hiring a private air ambulance.  It  may  have  been  appropriate  in
    accordance with the findings for the judge to direct a short  period  of
    leave, at least until the time the baby was born, to allow the appellant
    to be present at the birth, but that is not a matter for me because that
    is not what happened.

 5. Mr Singh was not able to advance any detailed argument  to  support  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal. It is the Secretary of State's case
    that MM is not a decision to be followed and that the Rules  are  to  be
    followed and the appeal should have been dismissed.  Mr Singh made  that
    much extremely clear but MM had to be considered and, other  then  being
    mentioned by name, it was not.

 6. Having found that there is an error of law  I  have  to  decide  how  to
    advance the case.  My starting point would be to  determine  the  appeal
    now on the facts as found but I do not think that  would  be  the  right
    thing to do.  This is because I am told, and I accept  although  I  have
    not seen any evidence for this,  that  the  appellant's  wife,  who  was
    heavily pregnant is January 2014, has been delivered of a child, in this
    case a son. I am pleased to say I have been told that the boy is healthy
    and everybody is very happy.

 7. However, the arrival of  the  baby  will  impact  significantly  on  the
    finances of the couple, both in terms of what they have to spend and  in
    terms of their ability to earn a living.  I was told  in  general  terms
    that the appellant's wife intends to carry on  earning  and  understands
    that her sister-in-law will look after the baby.  This may be right  but
    it was not disclosed  in  any  properly  admissible  form  and  was  not
    something that the Secretary of State had an opportunity of  considering
    or checking.

 8. I am aware that people who choose to  come  before  the  Upper  Tribunal
    without preparing their cases when new evidence suggest that they should
    have been prepared are not normally entitled to a lot sympathy but  this
    case is clearly going to concern the interests of a small child who  may
    be a British national. He must not be disadvantaged in any  way  because
    of any dilatoriness in the preparation of the case.  It is also right to
    say that the appellant and his wife have had a great deal more to  think
    about more about recently than immigration matters.  I do not wish to be
    unduly critical but the fact is that the preparation has not been done.

 9. I have decided therefore that the proper way to address  this  error  of
    law is for the matter to be remitted  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  for
    there to be fresh findings on the impact of removal on  the  family,  on
    how the family could manage in Bangladesh, if at all, and on what  their
    financial circumstances in the United Kingdom are now, and both findings
    of fact will then illuminate a proper decision on human rights grounds.

10. It may be that by then the judgment of the Court of Appeal  in  MM  will
    be available to us but I do not ask for the case be left until that  has
    happened because that might take longer than anyone expects.

11. It follows, therefore, that I allow the appeal and direct that the  case
    be heard again in the First-tier Tribunal for the findings indicated  to
    be made and a proper decision made in accordance with the law.
