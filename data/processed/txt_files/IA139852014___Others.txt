Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Welsh, Counsel, instructed by Trent Centre for
Human Rights
For the Respondent:    Ms Johnstone (HOPO)
Interpreter:     Mr Samuel


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants, born June 1, 1967, August 16, 1966, July  6,  1996  and
    April 29, 1994 respectively are citizens  of  India.  The  first  named
    appellant entered the United Kingdom on September 25, 2009  with  leave
    to enter as a Tier 4 (General) student until April 30, 2011. This leave
    was  extended  until  July  25,  2013.  The  remaining  appellants  are
    dependants of the first appellant and their leave matched that  granted
    to the main appellant. They all submitted applications to extend  their
    stay under the Immigration Rules  on  July  18,  2013.  The  respondent
    refused their applications on March 11, 2014 under  paragraph  245ZX(a)
    and 322(1A) HC 395 and decisions were taken to remove them  by  way  of
    directions under section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum and  Nationality
    Act 2006.

 2. The appellants appealed to the First-tier Tribunal under Section  82(1)
    of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 on March  21,  2014
    and  on  July  14,  2014  Judge  of  the  First  Tier  Tribunal  Davies
    (hereinafter referred to as the "FtTJ")  heard  their  appeals  and  in
    determination promulgated on July 15,  2014  he  refused  their  claims
    under paragraph 322(1A) HC 395.

 3. The appellants lodged grounds of appeal on September 29,  2014  and  on
    October  7,  2014  Designated  Judge  Zucker  extended  time  and  gave
    permission to appeal finding there were arguable grounds that the  FtTJ
    had erred in his approach.

 4. The matter came before me on December 11, 2014 and at that  hearing  Mr
    McVeety, the Home Office representative, accepted  that  the  FtTJ  had
    failed to deal with the private and family life claims despite the fact
    article 8 had been raised in the grounds of appeal. An error of law was
    therefore made out.

 5. Mr Hussain, the appellant's representative, then argued that  the  FtTJ
    had erred in rejecting the claim under  the  Immigration  Rules.  After
    hearing submissions I found the appeals were correctly dismissed  under
    paragraph 245ZX(a) HC 395 but the  findings  in  respect  of  paragraph
    322(1A) HC 395 were flawed.

 6. I directed that the matter be listed for a hearing on  article  8  ECHR
    and 322(1A) HC 395 and the matter came before me on the  date  set  out
    above.

    PRELIMINARY ISSUE

 7. At the previous hearing on December 11, 2014 I gave directions for  the
    future disposal of this appeal. I directed that any additional evidence
    should be served by January 26, 2015.

 8. Although the  appellants'  representatives  served  additional  witness
    statements late on January 28, 2015 and a large bundle on  February  4,
    2015  I  nevertheless  agreed  to  admit  them  into  evidence  despite
    submissions from Ms Johnstone to refuse them. The fact  they  had  been
    served on the Tribunal prior to the hearing was a factor  I  took  into
    account when allowing their admission.

 9. However, when Mr Welsh invited me  to  admit  further  evidence  namely
    mobile phones and a bank statement I refused  this  request.  This  was
    evidence that existed prior to the  original  hearing.  The  appellants
    failed to produce that evidence at that time and also failed to make an
    application to adduce the evidence prior to the hearing on December 11,
    2014. Mr Welsh accepted the appellants had not co-operated  with  their
    solicitors and no blame should be placed on the representatives.

10. The evidence should have been  documented  prior  to  the  hearing  and
    served in accordance with the Rules and in view of  the  non-compliance
    and the appellants' own neglect I concluded that it would be unfair  on
    the respondent to adduce this evidence at the eleventh hour.

11. Having ruled on this issue I invited Mr Welsh to call his  evidence  on
    the two issues namely whether a finding should be made under  paragraph
    322(1A) HC 395 and article 8 ECHR.

    EVIDENCE

12. The four appellants each gave evidence and were each cross-examined  by
    Ms Johnstone.

13. Ms Neena Bhatti adopted her recent statement and explained  that  prior
    to coming to the United Kingdom she had worked in India as a  qualified
    nurse and had obtained a diploma in nursing. She came here to "upgrade"
    her standing as a nurse internationally. She agreed  that  on  previous
    occasions she had used an agent or  friend  or  been  assisted  by  the
    university. For the current application a friend advised her to  use  a
    firm called Study Solutions. She told him she wanted to obtain  a  work
    permit but he advised her that due to the shortness of time she  should
    apply for a further study visa although she believed she was  going  to
    study health and social care. It was all a rush the  day  she  and  her
    family signed the forms partly because Mr Shiv, her representative, was
    running late. She did not  read  the  contents  and  was  unaware  that
    fraudulent documents had been submitted with them. She stated that  she
    had not provided him with any of the  fraudulent  documents.  When  she
    went to enrol on the course she discovered it was an accountancy course
    so she contacted Mr Shiv who told her not to worry and  that  once  the
    visa was granted she  could  change  course.  After  she  received  her
    refusal letter she tried to speak to Mr Shiv but  he  was  evasive  and
    would not return her calls or answer her texts. She  believed  that  if
    she had to leave then she would be unable to resume her nursing  career
    in India because she had not been doing that type  of  work  and  would
    have to go back to study before she would stand any chance of obtaining
    work.

14. In cross-examination by Ms Johnstone she agreed that on every  previous
    occasions she had had to produce  financial  evidence  to  support  her
    application but on this occasion she had not had  to  because  she  was
    supposed to be applying for a work permit. It was put to her that  when
    she signed the form she would have been aware she needed  to  show  she
    had over �20,000 and that she had failed to produce any evidence  based
    on the account she was giving. She blamed the agent for this.  She  was
    questioned why she needed more training to be  a  nurse  when  she  had
    worked for nineteen years as one in India and she  responded  that  she
    intended to do an English exam that she had never taken  and  that  she
    would need. It was put to her that it made no sense that she wanted  to
    do a course in health and social care when she just said she wanted  to
    take an English exam and she said Mr Shiv said she had to  do  it  this
    way as there was insufficient time to apply for what  she  wanted.  She
    explained that she did not contact the Home Office to  tell  them  what
    had happened after she was refused because she was upset and nervous.

15. I asked her to tell me details about her  personal  situation  and  she
    indicated that she had two sisters and a brother in India but that  her
    brother had fallen out with her because her husband was a Hindu and she
    was a Christian. She agreed that she spoke to her siblings occasionally
    on the telephone but maintained she had no one to turn to in India.

16. She claimed she would be unable to carry out her religious  beliefs  in
    India in the way she could here but agreed that this was not  something
    she had raised until this hearing although she claimed to have told her
    solicitors about the problem.

17. Stephen Bhatti adopted his recent statement and confirmed his  mother's
    claim that they had all come to London to sign  the  application  forms
    but that he was not aware fraudulent documents were used. He  confirmed
    his mother's account they had  tried  to  contact  Mr  Shiv  after  the
    application was refused and he stated they had no letters had been sent
    to him or received from him.  He  confirmed,  albeit  for  a  different
    amount, that money had been paid to Mr  Shiv  for  him  to  file  their
    applications. He stated that he wanted to  embark  on  an  air  traffic
    controller course that was not taught in India  and  he  felt  that  he
    needed his family with him to financially and morally support him.

18. In cross-examination he  also  accepted  that  in  the  past  financial
    documents were submitted to support applications and  that  his  mother
    had sent them to them. He claimed they were not required to  bring  any
    financial  documents  for  the  current  applications  only  cash.   He
    confirmed that he had made no enquiries about studying in India.

19. Taniya Bhatti adopted her statement and stated she had never  seen  the
    fraudulent documents but was aware her mother was told to bring between
    �4,000 and �5,000 but eventually only paid �2,000.  She  indicated  she
    was studying for a BTEC in maths and English  and  then  she  hoped  to
    commence an Access to Science course and then go to university to study
    medicine. She indicated she had many friends in the United Kingdom  and
    liked to play the piano and sing songs. Family was  very  important  to
    her although she would be all right if her mother had to leave but  she
    would miss her support.

20. Under cross-examination she stated  she  had  been  attending  boarding
    school and living with her grandmother  before  coming  to  the  United
    Kingdom. She had not made any enquiries about courses in India.

21. Mr Shahsi Bhushan Bhatti confirmed his  wife's  account  regarding  the
    current application forms and the fact they were required  to  pay  Mr.
    Shiv up to �5,000 albeit the amount eventually paid (�2,000) was  less.
    He explained that he had been working until January 2015 when he had an
    operation for glaucoma. He also suffered from  diabetes  and  his  wife
    helped him with his medication. He had no ongoing treatment or problems
    albeit he wore a patch for a month after the  operation.  He  explained
    his wife came to the United Kingdom to  expand  her  knowledge  and  to
    brighten her future and theirs. She decided this was a nice country and
    then brought the  remainder  of  her  family  over  as  dependants.  He
    emphasised he wanted to be a father to his children be that here or  in
    India and he did not believe it would be easy for his  wife  to  follow
    her religion in India.

22. Under cross-examination he reiterated what the other witnesses had said
    about financial paperwork namely that on previous applications his wife
    had submitted the necessary paperwork. He confirmed that  in  India  he
    had worked for thirteen to fourteen years before coming here  and  that
    he had been a  Christian,  like  his  wife,  since  1991  when  he  was
    baptised.

    SUBMISSIONS

23. Ms Johnstone invited me to uphold the finding under  paragraph  322(1A)
    HC 395. She said it was not disputed  that  false  documents  had  been
    submitted and it was also not disputed that the first  named  appellant
    had signed the declaration on the application form. Her  case  was  she
    did not know what she sent off but Ms  Johnstone  invited  me  to  find
    against her because her actions undermined her claims of innocence. She
    had always provided financial documents so her claim none  were  needed
    this time for a student application lacked credibility. She went to her
    course but said nothing about being  on  the  wrong  course  until  her
    application was refused and  she  submitted  that  if  the  first-named
    appellant was genuine then why had she not spoken to Mr Shiv before the
    refusal or contacted the home office. There was no evidence she had the
    funds required and to this day she had not  produced  any.  The  simple
    truth was her post-study visa was expiring and could  not  be  extended
    and she was correctly told she could not apply for a work  permit.  She
    was blaming an agent when in reality the fault lay  on  her  shoulders.
    Her oral evidence was she wanted to take an  English  course  but  this
    contradicted her claim she wanted to  take  a  heath  and  social  care
    course even though she had nineteen years experience  as  a  nurse.  Ms
    Johnstone invited me to find she had knowingly acted dishonestly.

24. Ms Johnstone  went  onto  address  me  on  the  Immigration  Rules  and
    submitted they could not meet the Rules. They came on  temporary  visas
    with no expectation of being allowed to stay and both children would be
    able to continue their studies in India and the husband  had  indicated
    he had worked for many years in India. With the exception of  the  main
    appellant all of the others had come as dependants  and  would  all  be
    able to continue their lives in India. Friendships could  be  continued
    other than by direct contact and there was no evidence that the  first-
    named appellant could not practise her religion. Applying Section  117B
    of the 2002 Act she submitted the public interest  was  in  maintaining
    immigration control because the parents did not appear  able  to  speak
    English to the required level with both using the  interpreter  at  the
    hearing and the main appellant admitted she wanted to study an  English
    course. Their private lives were precarious since  July  2013  and  the
    younger appellants had only been here for fourteen months whereas  they
    had all spent the majority  of  their  lives  in  India.  Ms  Johnstone
    submitted it would not be disproportionate to require the family to  be
    removed.

25. Mr Welsh adopted his skeleton argument that had been faxed on  February
    6, 2015. He submitted that the witnesses all confirmed  that  the  main
    appellant relied on Mr Shiv and that money had been paid  to  him.  Her
    actions were not dishonest although they may be described as naive. The
    application form suggested someone other than the appellants  completed
    them and the fraudulent documents were ham-fisted and basic errors were
    made. The appellant should  not  be  blamed  for  the  actions  of  her
    representatives. He submitted that MR Shiv was a  confidence  trickster
    and he had duped the family.

26. Mr Welsh then addressed me on article 8 claims, accepting they did  not
    meet the  Rules.  He  submitted  the  main  appellant  was  a  positive
    influence on society and the family  had  not  been  a  burden  on  the
    taxpayers. The main appellant had come here to develop her  skills  and
    the family had joined her lawfully. They wanted to live  together  here
    as a family and continue their studies and work. The fact they used the
    interpreter should not be held against the appellants and it  would  be
    disproportionate to remove them.

27. I reserved my decision.

    DISCUSSIONS AND FINDINGS

28. There were two issues for me to consider. Firstly, I  had  to  consider
    whether the appellants had established a right to remain under  article
    8 and secondly I had to consider  whether  a  finding  under  paragraph
    322(1A) HC 395 should be made.

29. It was not disputed  that  the  Immigration  Rules  were  not  met  and
    following a recent line of cases I was invited to consider their claims
    outside of the Rules.  Ms  Johnstone  did  not  suggest  I  should  not
    consider them under article 8 so I proceeded to consider them following
    the principles set out in Razgar [2004] UKHL 00027 and Section 117B  of
    the 2002 Act.

30. The argument advanced was that the family had family life and I find it
    is probably just arguable they demonstrated this they are  parents  and
    children and whilst the children are over eighteen  they  had  recently
    been living as a family unit. The decisions to remove  them  would  not
    interfere with family life if they were removed as a family  unit.  The
    main appellant had been here the longest and her husband  and  children
    had subsequently followed. I am satisfied that  if  they  were  removed
    together then family life would not be interfered with as they would be
    removed as a unit. I therefore find that the family life claim falls at
    the second Razgar question.

31. Turning to the issue of private life I  accept  that  the  family  have
    established a private life and that removal would interfere with  their
    respective plans. The children both want to  study  or  train  and  the
    mother wanted to also work or study. The father  had  been  working  as
    well. Any removal would be in accordance with the law and  for  one  of
    the reasons set out in article 8(2) ECHR.

32. The issue in each of their cases was whether removal was  proportionate
    and in considering  proportionality  I  have  to  have  regard  to  the
    evidence and when considering the public interest I have to have regard
    to section 117B of the 2002 Act.

33. The  first-named  appellant  has  been  in  the  United  Kingdom  since
    September 2009. The second-named appellant came in  November  2010  and
    the other appellants came in April  2012  when  they  were  16  and  18
    respectively.

34. I am satisfied that three of the appellants came as dependants  whereas
    the main appellant came initially as a student and then progressed to a
    Tier 1 post study migrant. At the time  of  her  last  application  she
    found herself unable to extend her stay as a Tier 1 migrant and  whilst
    she talked of extending her stay as a work permit holder no explanation
    has ever been advanced as  to  how  that  was  to  be  achieved.  I  am
    satisfied that when her visa was about to expire she sought  to  extend
    her stay by returning to the classroom.

35. Mr Welsh's submission to  me  is  that  she  has  provided  a  positive
    influence on society and has not been a burden on the British tax payer
    and both those comment may be correct so far as she is concerned but  I
    cannot lose sight of the fact her status here has always been temporary
    and by failing to meet the Immigration Rules her right to  remain  here
    ended unless removal would breach her right to private life.

36. The second appellant came as a dependant and has no right to remain  in
    his own right. He worked legally until recently. He had an operation at
    an NHS hospital presumably at public expense because  no  evidence  was
    provided that he paid for his treatment. He  admitted  he  could  be  a
    father to his children either here or in India and he also admitted  he
    had previously worked  in  India.  There  is  nothing  in  his  medical
    condition that would engage article 8 specifically as he told  me  that
    following his operation he had recovered albeit he wore a patch for one
    month after the operation.

37. The third and fourth appellants came as children and studied here.  The
    third named appellant would like to do an air traffic controller course
    but admitted he had made no enquiries about a similar course in  India.
    The impression I gained was that he simply expected to be allowed to do
    the course because he was here.  His  sister  was  studying  Maths  and
    English and wanted to then take an Access to Science  course  with  the
    intention of going to study medicine at university. She too  seemed  to
    think that she was able to take what courses she wanted in  the  United
    Kingdom albeit clearly there was an education system  in  India.  I  do
    question whether her qualifications would enable her to  take  medicine
    but ultimately that would be a matter for someone else to decide and is
    not a judicial decision.

38. I am satisfied that none of the  appellants  have  explained  why  they
    would be unable to continue their private lives in India. The  Tribunal
    in Nasim and others (Article 8) [2014] UKUT  00025  (IAC)  reminded  us
    that an expectation of study or work does not create  a  private  life.
    Neither of the children is in  the  middle  of  critical  courses  that
    removal would interfere with their education.

39. Section 117B requires  me  to  have  regard  to  certain  factors  when
    considering public interest.

40. I accept all of the appellants can speak  English  to  varying  degrees
    with the two younger appellants speaking  excellent  English.  However,
    the two older appellants' English abilities are less clear as both used
    the interpreter, which indicated they were more  comfortable  in  their
    native language. The main appellant also stated she had intended taking
    an English course.  Balanced  against  that  is  the  fact  the  second
    appellant was able to hold a job down and the first named appellant had
    attended college and had also worked. On balance I find their levels of
    English would not mean they would be a burden on the taxpayers although
    clearly integration would be more  difficult  if  they  did  not  speak
    English well. The fact they have some command of the  English  language
    also means I am able to find they could be financially independent  and
    therefore not a burden on the taxpayers.

41. They have  all  been  here  legally  but  as  they  did  not  meet  the
    Immigration Rule under which they applied I  am  satisfied  their  stay
    since July 2013 has been precarious.

42. In considering the issue of removal I find the following factors  carry
    more weight than their desire to remain here. These factors are:

          a. No expectancy they would be allowed to remain.

          b. Their private lives have been built around study and work over
             a relatively short period of time.

          c. All appellants have lived  the  majority  of  their  lives  in
             India.

          d. Failure to meet the Immigration Rules.

          e. Private life precarious since July 2013.

          f. No evidence that they could not continue their lives  back  in
             India.

43.  I  therefore  find  that  removal  in   each   case   would   not   be
    disproportionate and I refuse their applications under article 8 ECHR.

44. I turn to the second issue namely whether  a  finding  under  paragraph
    322(1A) should be made. That paragraph applies:

          "Where false representations have been made or false documents  or
         information have been submitted (whether or  not  material  to  the
         application, and whether or not to the applicant's  knowledge),  or
         material  facts  have  not  been  disclosed,  in  relation  to  the
         application."

45. There is no dispute that false documents were submitted. These included
    two false letters to the home office and a bank statement. It is  these
    documents that the respondent shows the appellant was fully aware  that
    false documents were submitted.

46. The applications were refused, as long ago as March  2014  but  despite
    this the first-named appellant produced nothing to  the  FtTJ  in  July
    2014 that supported her claims and even when the matter came before  me
    in  December  2014  nothing  was  produced.  The  representatives  then
    submitted another bundle of documents only a week or so  ago  but  this
    bundle contained nothing that may assist her apart  an  acknowledgement
    of a letter of complaint that was sent on  December  19,  2014.  Little
    effort was made by this appellant to properly argue her case.  Today  I
    refused permission to produce mobile phones to show text messages and I
    did so because it would be unfair to produce evidence at  the  door  of
    court that could have been produced at anytime over  the  previous  ten
    months. There would be no way of cross checking  the  messages  and  to
    further allow the admission of a  bank  statement  again  at  the  last
    minute would also prove little as it would only  show  withdrawals  and
    the evidential weight would be virtually none as  it  would  not  prove
    anything and the respondent would be unable to counter what  was  going
    to suggested.

47. On the one hand I have the appellants' evidence that the main appellant
    did not act improperly whereas  the  respondent  submits  she  did.  Ms
    Johnstone obtained  evidence  in  cross-examination  that  all  of  the
    appellants knew financial  documents  were  needed  with  the  previous
    applications. No plausible explanation has  ever  been  tended  by  the
    appellants to explain why none were needed. They appeared to know  that
    financial documents were needed so what did the  first-named  appellant
    think was different this time. She knew she could not extend her Tier 1
    status and according to her oral evidence she could  not  apply  for  a
    work permit and so she was applying to study.

48. I simply do not accept she did not  know  false  documents  were  being
    submitted with her application. She and her family  were  desperate  to
    extend their stay because they liked the life here. They  were  running
    out of time and whilst they may not have provided the  documents  I  am
    satisfied she knew full well false documents were being submitted. That
    may explain why there are so many "ham-fisted" errors in the documents.
    She signed her application form and that  included  a  declaration  the
    contents were true.

49. The burden of proof in proving a document is false is on the respondent
    and the standard of proof is on the balance of probabilities. There  is
    no dispute these documents were  false.  The  Court  of  Appeal  in  AA
    (Nigeria) v SSHD [2010] EWCA Civ 773 confirms dishonesty is needed  and
    I am satisfied for the reasons  set  out  above  that  the  first-named
    appellant did act dishonestly. I  therefore  confirm  that  her  appeal
    under the  Immigration  Rules  was  properly  refused  under  paragraph
    322(1A) HC 395.

    DECISION

50. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did disclose an error in law in
    so far as article 8 ECHR is concerned and by failing to make a  finding
    under paragraph 322(1A) HC 395.

51. I remake the decision as follows:

      a. I uphold the dismissal of the appeal under the Immigration Rules.

      b. A finding under paragraph 322(1A) HC 395  against  the  first-named
         appellant should be made.

      c. I dismiss their appeals under article 8 ECHR.

52. Under Rule 14(1) The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (as
    amended)  an  appellant  can  be  granted  anonymity  throughout  these
    proceedings, unless and until a tribunal or court directs otherwise. An
    order was not made in the First-tier and I see no reason to amend  that
    order.
