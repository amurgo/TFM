                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh, born on 31st  December  1983.
    His appeal against the decision of the respondent, made on 7th  January
    2013, refusing his application  for  leave  to  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom as a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant under paragraph 245ZX  of
    HC 395, as amended, was dismissed after  a  hearing  before  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Dean, in a determination promulgated on 30th April 2013.

 2. On 2nd July 2013 I  granted  permission  to  appeal  on  the  following
    grounds:

          "As the  First-tier  Tribunal  judge  correctly  pointed  out  in
          paragraph 11 of her determination, the change to the  immigration
          rules  under  which  the  respondent  purported  to  refuse   the
          application, was effected by paragraph 458 of HC 760.   What  she
          failed to  notice,  however,  were  the  transitional  provisions
          contained in HC 760.  Paragraph 458 was not expressly listed as a
          paragraph which applied to all applications  decided  after  13th
          December 2012 and the First-tier Tribunal judge  failed  to  heed
          the provision in HC 760 which stated that in respect of the other
          changes set out in the Statement, if an  applicant  had  made  an
          application for entry clearance or leave before 13 December  2012
          and the application had not been decided  before  that  date,  it
          would be decided in accordance with the  Rules  in  force  on  12
          December 2012. "

 3. I indicated that for the reasons which I had  given  I  had  taken  the
    provisional view that  the  appeal  should  be  allowed  and  that  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal should be re-made by  allowing  the
    appeal without a hearing. I invited submissions to the contrary  to  be
    made to the Upper Tribunal within 21 days of the  date  of  the  order.
    No submissions  to  the  contrary  have  been  received  by  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

 4.  The  appellant's  application  was  made  on  18th   September   2012.
    Accordingly pursuant to  rule  34  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
    Tribunal) Rules 2008, I am satisfied that the decision  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal  contained  a  material  error  on  a  point  of  law  as
    identified in the grounds of appeal and grant of permission to  appeal.
    Therefore I set aside the  determination  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    dismissing the appeal. I am satisfied that the appellant complied  with
    the  requirements  of  paragraph  245ZX  of  HC  395,  as  amended  and
    accordingly I re-make the decision by allowing  the  appeal  under  the
    immigration rules.




Signed                                  Dated



P A Spencer
Judge of the Upper Tribunal
