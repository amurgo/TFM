For the Appellant:     Deborah Revill, instructed by MTC & Co Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Stephen Whitwell, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. On 16 March 2021, I issued a  decision  in  which  I  found  (with  the
    consent of the parties) that the First-tier Tribunal had erred  in  law
    in its decision to dismiss the appellant's appeal  on  Article  8  ECHR
    grounds.  I set that decision  aside  in  part  and  ordered  that  the
    decision on the appeal would be remade  following  a  further  hearing.
    The finding made by the FtT in respect of the Immigration  Rules  (that
    the appellant  could  not  establish  that  there  were  insurmountable
    obstacles to family life with her husband continuing in Sri Lanka)  was
    preserved, also with the consent of the parties.  This is  my  decision
    following the resumed hearing which took place on 16 July 2021.



Background

 2. I am able to take much of what follows from  the  concise  and  helpful
    skeleton prepared by Ms Revill of  counsel,  who  has  represented  the
    appellant throughout the life of this appeal.

 3. The appellant is a Sri Lankan national who  was  born  on  26  February
    1956.  She is  therefore  65  years  old.   She  has  been  married  to
    Balasubramaniam Shanmugham, a Sri Lankan national with Indefinite Leave
    to Remain ("ILR")  in  the  UK,  since  1977.   They  have  four  adult
    children, all of whom live in  the  United  Kingdom.   Three  of  those
    children are British citizens.  The fourth has ILR.

 4. The sponsor came to the United Kingdom in 1994.  It is  agreed  on  all
    sides that an asylum claim was made by him at some point  and  that  it
    was refused.  Ms Revill and Mr Whitwell were  also  prepared  to  agree
    that he was granted ILR in 2010 under the Legacy Programme and not as a
    result of an entitlement to refugee status or another status under  the
    Immigration Rules.

 5. The appellant entered the UK holding entry clearance as a spouse  on  6
    March 2014.  She made an in-time application for further leave in  that
    capacity on 18 October 2016.  The application was refused on 28 January
    2017 and the respondent  certified  the  claim  as  clearly  unfounded.
    Judicial review proceedings followed.  Those proceedings were  resolved
    by consent, with the respondent agreeing to pay the appellant's  costs.



 6. The application was reconsidered and refused again on 14 May 2018.  The
    respondent considered that the sponsor was unable to meet the Financial
    Requirements in Appendix FM of the Immigration  Rules  and  that  there
    were no insurmountable obstacles to their  relationship  continuing  in
    Sri Lanka.

 7. The appellant appealed and  her  appeal  was  heard  by  Judge  Andrew,
    sitting in Birmingham on 19 November 2018.  It was common  ground  that
    the  appellant  could  not  meet  the  Financial  Requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  It was argued that the FtT should nevertheless take
    into account the support  available  to  the  appellant  from  her  son
    Mohanathas, with whom she and her husband have  lived  for  some  years
    (and continue to do so to date).  The  judge  rejected  that  argument,
    finding that there was no credible or sufficient evidence to  establish
    Mohanathas' ability to support his parents to the extent required.  The
    judge concluded that there was nothing to prevent the appellant and the
    sponsor living together in Sri Lanka and there was no reason  that  the
    children could not visit them there.  Considering the  public  interest
    in the maintenance of immigration control, the judge concluded that  it
    was proportionate to remove the appellant from the United Kingdom.

 8. Permission to appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal  against  Judge  Andrew's
    decision was refused on 7 March 2019.   On  23  March  2019,  she  made
    another application for leave to remain.  The claim was presented in an
    admirably concise letter from her current solicitors.  It was said that
    the appellant and the sponsor were financially self-sufficient in  that
    they  depended  on  their  son  Mohanathas,  who  had  an   income   of
    approximately �45,000  per  annum.   The  difficulties  in  the  couple
    relocating to Sri Lanka were highlighted, not  least  their  separation
    from their children and British grandchildren  in  the  UK.     It  was
    submitted that the appellant's removal would be contrary to section  55
    of  the   Borders,   Citizenship   and   Immigration   Act   2009   and
    disproportionate under Article 8 ECHR.

 9. The application was refused by  letter  dated  25  October  2019.   The
    respondent did not accept that there were insurmountable  obstacles  to
    family life between the appellant and the  sponsor  continuing  in  Sri
    Lanka.  She did  not  accept  that  there  would  be  very  significant
    obstacles to the appellant reintegrating to Sri  Lanka.   Nor  did  she
    accept that there were  exceptional  circumstances  which  warranted  a
    grant of leave to remain outside the Immigration Rules  with  reference
    to Article 8 ECHR.

10. On appeal, First-tier Tribunal Judge Butler found that  there  were  no
    insurmountable obstacles and that the appellant's removal would not  be
    contrary to Article 8  ECHR.   Permission  to  appeal  was  sought  and
    granted in respect of only the latter conclusion.  Before me on 4 March
    2021, it was agreed between the parties that the judge had erred in her
    conclusion that the appellant was not financially independent  for  the
    purposes of s117B(3) of the Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act
    2002 ("the 2002 Act").  The respondent felt unable to submit that  this
    error was immaterial to the outcome of the appeal and was  content  for
    the decision to be set aside and remade on Article 8 ECHR grounds, with
    the judge's finding on paragraph EX1 preserved.



The Resumed Hearing

11. In preparation for the resumed hearing, the appellant's solicitors  had
    filed and served a consolidated  bundle  of  155  pages.   I  was  also
    assisted by Ms Revill's skeleton argument.

12. I heard oral evidence from the appellant and her son Mohanathas.   Both
    required the assistance of the court-appointed Tamil interpreter,  whom
    they confirmed they could understand  before  giving  evidence.   There
    were no difficulties of translation noted during the  hearing  although
    Mohanathas opted to give some of his evidence in English, in  which  he
    is clearly fluent.  I do not propose to rehearse the oral  evidence  in
    this decision.  There is a full note of it in the Record of Proceedings
    and I shall refer to it insofar as it is necessary to do so to  explain
    my findings of fact.

13. Mr Whitwell relied on the respondent's decision and the submissions  he
    had previously made in writing in the response to the grounds of appeal
    under rule 24.  He accepted that there was a family life  in  existence
    between the members of Mohanathas' household and that the appellant was
    likely to have a private life with her other children.   The  question,
    he  submitted,  was  whether  there  would   be   unjustifiably   harsh
    consequences brought about by the appellant's  removal.   It  was  well
    established that that was a stringent test: R (Agyarko) v  SSHD  [2017]
    UKSC 11; [2017] Imm AR 764.

14. Mr Whitwell submitted  that  the  starting  point  for  the  Tribunal's
    analysis should be Judge Andrew's decision from 2018,  particularly  as
    regards the  question  of  third  party  support  being  provided  from
    Mohanathas.  When the  third  party  support  was  considered  in  more
    detail, it was far from clear that Mohanathas had enough money to  keep
    his found his parents to the extent which  would  be  required  by  the
    Immigration Rules.  His basic salary was in the region of  �42,000  and
    he had his own family to support.  There were significant outgoings, as
    was clear from his bank statements.

15. It was clear from the  decisions  of  the  FtT  that  the  sponsor  had
    returned to Sri Lanka repeatedly,  hence  the  concession  made  by  Ms
    Revill that she was unable to criticise the conclusion reached  by  the
    FtT as regards the existence of insurmountable obstacles.  It was  also
    to be recalled that neither the appellant nor the  sponsor  would  have
    any language issues there; that  she  had  received  medical  treatment
    there; and that there were  family  members  in  Sri  Lanka,  including
    siblings in Colombo.  There was  also  no  reason  to  think  that  the
    appellant's children in the UK would be  unable  to  provide  financial
    support. The absence  of  insurmountable  obstacles  was  an  important
    consideration in the assessment of proportionality.

16. It was incorrect and unhelpfully emotive to say that the sponsor was  a
    refugee.  In any event, the appellant and the sponsor had  lived  apart
    for many years whilst he was without status in the UK.   The  appellant
    asked the Tribunal to attach significance to the fact that she would be
    separated from her grandchildren but they would be remaining with their
    parents and it could not realistically be submitted that there would be
    a serious impact on their best interests.  She did not think that  they
    would be able to visit her in Sri Lanka but the sponsor said that  they
    had visited his parents-in law with and without the  children.   Whilst
    there were family relationships  at  stake  in  this  case,  there  was
    nothing which sufficed to overcome the public interest  in  immigration
    control.

17. Mr Whitwell submitted that the  appellant's  presence  in  the  UK  had
    caused a significant burden on the NHS.  She had not been  entitled  to
    surgery,  or  to  inpatient  treatment  for  one  and  a  half   months
    thereafter, or to the list of medication she now received.   She  might
    properly be able to submit  that  she  was  independent  of  the  state
    without reference to this cost but not when it was taken properly  into
    account.  If she was nevertheless financially independent, it was clear
    that  this  was  merely  a  neutral  point   in   the   assessment   of
    proportionality: Rhuppiah v SSHD [2018] UKSC 58;  [2019]  Imm  AR  452.
    There was no reason that such support could not continue whilst she was
    out of the UK.

18. Ultimately, submitted Mr Whitwell,  the  case  was  one  in  which  the
    appellant sought to choose the country in which she  would  pursue  her
    family life.  It was understandable that she wanted to be  in  the  UK,
    surrounded by her family, but the ECHR did not give her  the  right  to
    choose.  Properly analysed, there was a plethora  of  reasons  why  she
    should not remain in the UK.  There was nothing to show that  an  entry
    clearance application would be bound to succeed, whether as a spouse or
    as an Adult Dependent Relative.  An application  on  the  latter  basis
    would be particularly unmeritorious, given that it was  said  that  she
    looked after he grandchildren in the UK.

19. For the appellant, Ms  Revill  relied  on  her  skeleton  argument  and
    invited me to allow the appeal.  She accepted, as  she  had  since  the
    first hearing before the Upper Tribunal,  that  the  finding  regarding
    insurmountable obstacles should stand; it was not  suggested  that  the
    appellant and the  sponsor  could  not  live  there.   It  remained  to
    consider whether it was proportionate to expect them to do so, however.
     What was at issue, Ms Revill submitted, was the accepted  family  life
    between all members of Mohanathas' house and the private  life  between
    the appellant and her other children and other grandchildren in the UK.



20. Ms Revill submitted that  the  question  was  proportionality  and  the
    starting point in assessing the 'cons' which fell to be weighed against
    the appellant was s117B of the 2002  Act.   It  was  well  established,
    however, that the weight which was to be given to  the  maintenance  of
    lawful immigration control could vary  depending  on  the  facts.   The
    proper course was to consider the Immigration Rules and the  extent  to
    which the appellant fell short of them.  The absence of  insurmountable
    obstacles was not the end of the enquiry.  There was demonstrable third
    party support although, as Mr Whitwell had submitted, the existence  of
    genuine and reliable third party support was a  neutral  point  in  the
    assessment of proportionality.  What the appellant was required to show
    was an income of more than �18,600 and Mohanathas was able to show that
    his income was more than  adequate  to  cover  that  sum  and  his  own
    family's requirements.  His income was higher than his basic salary and
    he would be permitted to count  his  overtime  under  paragraph  18  of
    Appendix FM-SE.  The availability of that funding actively reduced  the
    public interest in the appellant's removal.

21. Ms Revill submitted  that  the  Adult  Dependent  Relative  rules  were
    irrelevant to the assessment, since the closer rule and the  one  under
    which the appellant would be expected to apply, was the spouse rule.

22. Turning to the appellant's treatment on the NHS,  Ms  Revill  submitted
    that the NHS would be entitled to claim the  cost  of  the  appellant's
    treatment and that it was a matter for the NHS as to whether  it  chose
    to do so.   The  appellant  had  accessed  treatment  quite  innocently
    believing that she was entitled to  it;  there  was  no  suggestion  of
    deceit or of health tourism.  If she was granted leave, she would  have
    to pay the Immigration Health Surcharge again and would be entitled  to
    receive treatment during the currency of her leave.

23. It had been submitted that the appellant's children  and  grandchildren
    could visit her in Sri Lanka but that was very  different  from  living
    with her.  The assessment of a child's best interests was a  broad  one
    and it would be in the best interests  of  the  grandchildren  for  the
    appellant to remain in the UK.  The  family  would  do  their  best  to
    support her in Sri Lanka but  sending  money  did  not  compensate  for
    family life.  The appellant and her husband were getting no younger and
    wished to be with their family in the UK.  Significant weight should be
    attached to the  relationships  described  in  the  evidence.   It  was
    relevant to consider the circumstances in which the appellant became an
    overstayer.  She had come  with  entry  clearance  as  spouse  but  the
    sponsor had retired before she made her application for further  leave,
    with the result that the Rules were no longer met.  The  appellant  did
    not seek to  present  the  respondent  or  the  Tribunal  with  a  fait
    accompli.

24. The sponsor had resided in the UK for a significant period and  it  was
    to be recalled that twenty years was thought in the  Immigration  Rules
    to represent a relevant threshold in terms of  unlawful  residence.  He
    had also been receiving  treatment  in  the  UK  and  was  entitled  to
    continue to depend on the NHS.

25. There were, Ms Revill submitted, various disparate factors  which  were
    all relevant to the  assessment  of  proportionality.   None  of  those
    factors would suffice on their own to render  the  appellant's  removal
    disproportionate but when combined, those factors sufficed to  overcome
    the public interest in the appellant's removal.

26. I reserved my decision at the conclusion of the submissions.



Analysis

27. It is now accepted that the appellant cannot  satisfy  the  Immigration
    Rules.  She does not have current leave  to  enter  or  remain  and  is
    therefore ineligible for leave to remain as a spouse under the Ten Year
    Route in Appendix FM.  She is not able,  in  any  event,  to  meet  the
    Financial Requirements set out in Appendices FM and FM-SE.  As a result
    of the preserved findings from the FtT, she is unable  to  satisfy  the
    requirements of the Ten Year Route, in that she cannot show that  there
    are insurmountable obstacles  to  the  relocation  of  her  husband  to
    Zimbabwe (paragraph EX1 of Appendix FM refers).

28. The FtT's finding that there were no insurmountable  obstacles  to  the
    couple's relocation to Sri Lanka had the most solid of foundations.  As
    Judge Butler noted at [11] and [19], the sponsor has  returned  to  Sri
    Lanka four or five times since receiving ILR and he and  the  appellant
    referred to Sri Lanka as their Motherland before the FtT.  For  similar
    reasons, no sensible argument could be made (nor does Ms Revill attempt
    to submit) that there  would  be  very  significant  obstacles  to  the
    appellant's reintegration to Sri  Lanka  so  as  to  satisfy  paragraph
    276ADE(1)(vi) of the Immigration Rules.  She has returned to Sri  Lanka
    since coming to the UK, she speaks  the  language  and  she  has  close
    relatives living in Colombo.   The  appellant  cannot  succeed  in  her
    appeal on the basis contemplated by the Court of Appeal at [34]  of  TZ
    (Pakistan) v SSHD [2018] EWCA Civ 1109; [2018] Imm  AR  1301  (ie  that
    satisfaction of the Rules is positively determinative of the appeal  on
    Article 8 ECHR grounds).

29. Ms Revill therefore submits  that  the  appellant's  removal  would  be
    unlawful under section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998 as being a breach
    of Article 8 ECHR.  In order to succeed in  that  submission,  what  Ms
    Revill must establish is that the interference with the Article 8  ECHR
    rights in question will give rise to unjustifiably harsh  consequences.
    In order to decide  whether  the  consequences  will  be  unjustifiably
    harsh, I shall set out my findings of fact before undertaking a balance
    sheet assessment of the 'pros' in favour of family and private life and
    the 'cons' which weigh in favour of immigration control: TZ  (Pakistan)
    refers, at [35], citing Hesham Ali v SSHD [2016] UKSC 60; [2016] 1  WLR
    4799.

30. The only real dispute as  to  the  facts  concerns  financial  matters.
    Leaving those matters to one side for the time being, I find  that  the
    appellant's  personal  and  family  circumstances  are  essentially  as
    claimed in the witness statements before me.  The key elements  are  as
    follows.

31. The appellant and her husband have been married  for  44  years.   They
    have four adult children, all of whom live in the  UK.   They  live  in
    Bedfordshire with their son Mohanathas, his wife  and  their  children,
    who are aged six and four.   Mohanathas  and  his  family  are  British
    citizens.  Two of the appellant's other children are  British  and  one
    has settled status.  The other children live nearby and  the  appellant
    and the sponsor  spend  time  with  them  and  with  their  other  four
    grandchildren.  The appellant and the sponsor assist around Mohanathas'
    house and with his children.  The family is mutually supportive and the
    appellant  will  have  benefitted  from  the  support   of   her   son,
    particularly whilst she  recovered  from  the  surgical  procedure  she
    underwent at the end of 2020 (as described below).

32. Mr Whitwell expressly accepted Ms Revill's submission, made at [10]  of
    her skeleton argument, that Article 8 ECHR is  engaged  in  its  family
    life aspect in relation to each member of  Mohanathas'  household.   In
    light of Mobeen  v  SSHD  [2021]  EWCA  Civ  886,  that  was  a  proper
    concession.  At [11] of her skeleton argument, Ms Revill suggested that
    she might argue that Article 8 ECHR was also engaged in its family life
    aspect  between  the  appellant,  her  other  children  and  her  other
    grandchildren.  That submission was not pursued orally, however, and it
    was ultimately agreed between the advocates  that  these  relationships
    instead formed part of the  appellant's  private  life  in  the  United
    Kingdom.

33. The appellant has been significantly unwell in recent years.   She  was
    diagnosed with non-alcoholic liver cirrhosis  in  March  2019.   On  15
    December 2020, she underwent a  whole  liver  transplant  at  Cambridge
    University Hospital.  She remained in hospital for six weeks after  the
    operation, during which time she  required  ventilator  support  via  a
    tracheostomy, antibiotic treatment for  pyrexia  and  reassurance  from
    staff who were able to speak to her in Tamil when she was agitated  and
    confused.  The appellant currently receives twelve different  types  of
    medication on prescription.

34. The appellant's husband has been in the UK since 1994. He was here  for
    sixteen years without status until he was granted ILR under the  Legacy
    Programme in 2010.  He is said to  have  medical  conditions  including
    asthma and high blood pressure.  He is in receipt of  a  state  pension
    which currently amounts to �144.69 per week.  He and the appellant have
    returned to Sri Lanka three times since she arrived in the  UK.   There
    was one visit in 2014 and a further two in 2016.  He has also  been  to
    Sri Lanka without the appellant, although it is not clear whether there
    were one or two additional  visits.   The  appellant  received  medical
    treatment on one of the occasions that she travelled to Sri Lanka.  She
    and the sponsor remained in the country for three months or so for this
    visit.

35. The appellant stated in her application form that she had no family  in
    Sri Lanka and that her entire family was in the UK.  The  sponsor  told
    Judge Butler that the appellant had no siblings in Sri Lanka.  That was
    not correct.  The appellant's evidence at the hearing was that she  was
    one of five siblings, the oldest of whom is two years her  senior,  the
    youngest of whom is five years her junior.   Three  of  those  siblings
    live in Colombo.  The other one lives in Switzerland.  The sponsor also
    has siblings living in Sri Lanka.  Whilst I heard no  evidence  on  the
    point, I consider it more likely than not that the  appellant  and  the
    sponsor stayed with these family members for some or all  of  the  time
    they have spent in Sri Lanka since 2014.

36. In my judgment, the personal and family consequences of  the  appellant
    being removed to Sri Lanka will be as follows.

37. The appellant's children and her grandchildren will remain  in  the  UK
    and she will lose regular face-to-face contact with them.   Insofar  as
    it was suggested that the appellant's husband would not relocate to Sri
    Lanka with her, I do not accept that evidence.  He has strong  ties  to
    the UK and is supported in this country by his four children.  There is
    no evidence in the consolidated bundle to establish that he suffers ill
    health which necessitates his remaining in the UK to receive  treatment
    on the NHS.  There is evidence to suggest that he has asthma  and  high
    blood pressure but there is no evidence to suggest that  he  could  not
    receive adequate treatment for these common conditions in Colombo.

38. In his witness statement, the sponsor expresses a fear of returning  to
    Sri Lanka as a result of the change in the  government  there.   Having
    considered the recent country guidance in KK & RS (Sri Lanka) CG [2021]
    UKUT 130 (IAC), I do  not  consider  that  the  election  of  President
    Gotabaya has brought about such changes that  the  sponsor  -  who  has
    returned there on four or five occasions without incident - would be at
    any greater risk.

39. The sponsor is in receipt of the state  pension  in  the  UK.   He  can
    continue to draw that pension in Sri Lanka.  His ILR would lapse if  he
    was outside the UK for more than two years but he would wish to  return
    to the UK to  visit  his  children  and  grandchildren  in  any  event.
    Equally, the family in the UK would wish to visit  the  family  in  Sri
    Lanka, as Mohanathas confirmed they had done in the  past.   Ms  Revill
    also accepted that it was likely  that  Mohanathas  would  support  his
    parents financially in the event that they returned to Sri Lanka.  That
    was a proper  concession  in  the  light  of  the  oral  evidence  that
    Mohanathas supports his parents-in-law, who live  in  Vavuniya  in  Sri
    Lanka.

40. The appellant has her siblings in Sri Lanka.  They  live  in  different
    places in Colombo and it is more likely than not that the appellant and
    her husband would be able to stay with family upon return.   I  do  not
    accept that the appellant's husband (who did not give  evidence  before
    me) values  his  ties  to  the  UK  more  highly  than  he  values  his
    relationship with  his  wife.   It  is  established  by  the  preserved
    findings that there are no insurmountable obstacles to their relocating
    to Sri Lanka and I consider, on balance, that  the  most  likely  'real
    world' outcome in the event of the  appellant's  removal  is  that  the
    sponsor would relocate to Sri Lanka.

41. Ms Revill submitted that it was  a  matter  of  significance  that  the
    sponsor has been in the UK for more than twenty years, that  being  the
    threshold in paragraph 276ADE(1)(iii) of the Immigration Rules.  I take
    his length of residence into account but I do not accept  that  it  has
    the effect for which Ms Revill appears to contend.   The  threshold  in
    paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) is  not  -  as  is  sometimes  suggested  -  an
    acceptance by the respondent that a person will inevitably have accrued
    such Article 8 ECHR rights by this stage that their removal would be  a
    breach of that article.  It is, instead, an administrative  convenience
    - a pragmatic watershed - which recognises that there comes a point  at
    which regularisation  is  likely  to  be  the  fairest  course  to  the
    individual concerned.

42. I think it likely that the departure of the appellant and  her  husband
    would be very upsetting  for  the  appellant,  her  husband  and  their
    children.  They would be able to maintain  communication  by  telephone
    and possibly by more  modern  means  but  the  reality  (as  stated  in
    authorities from the Upper Tribunal and the Court  of  Appeal  which  I
    need not mention) is that this is no real  substitute  for  the  family
    life  which  is  currently  enjoyed  by  the  members  of   Mohanathas'
    household.  Nor would occasional visits serve to replicate  the  family
    life which is currently enjoyed in the UK in any meaningful way.

43. It was not submitted by Ms Revill that  the  appellant's  health  is  a
    matter which weighs in her favour in  the  scales  of  proportionality.
    She was correct not to make that submission.  The appellant's treatment
    was successful and  although  she  will  certainly  require  indefinite
    immunosuppressant  treatment  to  prevent  her   body   rejecting   the
    transplanted  liver,  there  is  no  evidence  to  suggest  that   this
    medication or anything else which she presently receives from  the  NHS
    is not available and accessible to her in Colombo.

44. The appellant's grandchildren, all six of whom are under ten years old,
    would also be upset by the removal of the appellant and  the  departure
    of their grandfather.  Although she cited Dasgupta [2016] UKUT 28 (IAC)
    in  her  skeleton  argument,  Ms  Revill's   submission   about   these
    relationships was  characteristically  measured.   She  submitted  that
    there would be some impact on the best interests of  the  grandchildren
    if one or both of the grandparents were no longer physically present in
    their lives.  I am prepared to accept that  this  is  correct  but  the
    submission can go no further than that.

45. This is not a case in which the removal of the appellant  will  have  a
    serious impact on Mohanathas' children (or, for  that  matter,  on  the
    appellant's other grandchildren).   They  have  loving  and  supportive
    parents who are able to provide for them.   They  have  a  stable  home
    life.  They have an education.  There is no indication in the  evidence
    that they are other than mentally and physically well.   The  departure
    of the appellant and her husband  from  their  lives  will  upset  them
    greatly but their essential needs will continue to be met and  it  must
    be remembered that these  are  young  children  who  adapt  quickly  to
    changed circumstances.  There will be an impact on their best interests
    but not one which adds significantly to the  appellant's  side  of  the
    'balance sheet' assessment which I am required to undertake.

46. Clear 'pros' weighing in favour of  the  appellant  are  therefore  the
    effective separation of the appellant from her close family members  in
    the UK; the impact on the best interests of her grandchildren; and  the
    disruption which will be caused to the  appellant's  husband's  settled
    family and private life, including his right to access the  NHS,  as  a
    result of his likely decision to return to Sri Lanka  to  be  with  his
    wife.  Those consequences  will  be  mitigated  to  an  extent  by  the
    availability of telephone and other contact, the possibility of visits,
    and the support from which the appellant and her husband can benefit in
    Colombo.  Those points in mitigation serve only  marginally  to  reduce
    the real emotional consequences of the appellant's enforced  departure,
    however.

47. Turning to the financial considerations, it is  necessary  to  consider
    where on the balance sheet  of  proportionality  they  should  feature,
    since  it  was  an  important  part  of  Ms  Revill's   argument   that
    Mohanathas's willingness and ability to support his parents  positively
    reduces  the  public  interest  in  the   appellant's   removal.    His
    willingness to do so is not in dispute.  There is disagreement  between
    the parties as regards his ability to do so in the sums required by the
    Immigration Rules.

48. It is not in dispute that Mohanathas is employed by  a  food  wholesale
    business.  He is a production manager and is responsible, he  explained
    at the hearing, for ensuring that the foodstuffs are  produced  to  the
    requisite standard.  He was asked  a  number  of  questions  about  his
    income and his  outgoings.   He  stated  in  his  most  recent  witness
    statement that his annual salary is �60,000 plus overtime.   I  do  not
    think that is correct and Ms Revill did not attempt to suggest that  it
    was after considering the payslips.  There is no contract of employment
    before me.  The payslips show that Mohanathas is paid  a  basic  hourly
    rate of �20 per hour.  He said that this had recently risen  to  �20.60
    per hour.  He explained that he is expected to work 40 hours per  week.
    At the higher rate (which Mr Whitwell did not  seek  to  dispute),  his
    annual income without overtime is just under �43,000 per annum.

49. Mohanathas also receives overtime, and he explained in evidence that he
    is expected to do overtime to ensure that productions runs are properly
    supervised.  Overtime is paid at a rate of time and  a  half:  �30  per
    hour.  The amount of overtime he does varies widely, from 3.5 hours  in
    the weekly payslip at page 28 of the consolidated  bundle  (a  week  in
    January 2021) to 45 hours in the payslip which appears at page 33  (the
    week before Christmas in December 2020).

50. The income which is recorded on Mohanathas' P60 for the year  ending  5
    April 2020 (�60,145) reflects his basic  pay  and  his  overtime.   His
    final payslip for the year ending April 2021 shows an  income  of  over
    �67,000 for the year.  There was some debate before me over  whether  I
    should take into account only his basic pay or  whether  the  composite
    sum should be taken as his income. I  am  grateful  to  Ms  Revill  for
    reminding me that paragraph 18(b) of Appendix FM-SE of the  Immigration
    Rules permits overtime to be taken into account in  calculating  income
    from salaried employment.  I do not consider Mohanathas' employment  to
    be 'salaried'.  There is no definition of that term in paragraph  6  of
    the Immigration Rules but what is said in paragraph 18(d)  of  Appendix
    FM-SE corresponds with the ordinary usage of that word:

         (d) Gross income from non-salaried employment will be calculated on
         the same basis  as  income  from  salaried  employment,  except  as
         provided in paragraph 18(e) and 18(f), and the requirements of this
         Appendix for specified evidence  relating  to  salaried  employment
         shall apply as if references to salary were  references  to  income
         from non-salaried employment. Non-salaried employment includes that
         paid at an hourly or other rate (and the number and/or  pattern  of
         hours required to be worked may vary),  or  paid  an  amount  which
         varies  according  to  the  work   undertaken,   whereas   salaried
         employment includes that paid at  a  minimum  fixed  rate  (usually
         annual) and is subject usually to a contractual minimum  number  of
         hours to be worked.   [emphasis added]

51. Ultimately, it makes no real difference whether Mohanathas'  employment
    is salaried or non-salaried.  Either way, the  respondent's  policy  as
    expressed in Appendix FM-SE is that his  overtime  may  be  taken  into
    account for the purpose of calculating his income.  I am satisfied that
    he is required to work a certain amount of overtime as a result of  his
    role.  I am satisfied that his total income,  taking  account  of  that
    overtime, is in the region of �60,000 per annum.

52. In reliance on Mohanathas' income  and  the  sponsor's  pension  income
    (which amounts to just over �7500 per annum), Ms Revill does not merely
    submit that the appellant is financially independent, as that statutory
    term is defined in Rhuppiah v SSHD.  She has also submitted  throughout
    the life of this appeal that the appellant and  the  sponsor  would  be
    able to meet the Minimum Income Requirement (of �18,600 per  annum)  if
    proper account is taken of the support available from Mohanathas.  That
    submission takes as its foundation what was said by Lady Hale and  Lord
    Carnwath (with whom the rest of the Justices agreed) at [99]-[101] of R
    (MM (Lebanon) & Ors) v SSHD [2017] UKSC 10; [2017] Imm AR 729.

53. I am not able to accept that submission.   In  order  to  establish  it
    evidentially, what Ms Revill must show is  that  there  is  a  credible
    source of funding which  suffices  to  meet  the  shortfall  under  the
    Immigration Rules.  She cannot do so, in my judgment, merely by showing
    that Mohanathas' income exceeds the sum required in Appendix FM  for  a
    family of four (�24,800) plus the sum required by a  couple  (�18,600).
    Appendix  FM  itself  mandates   no   such   consideration   in   these
    circumstances and Article 8 ECHR requires  that  I  must  look  to  the
    reality of the situation, as  stated  in  MM  (Lebanon).  It  would  be
    unrealistic simply to overlook Mohanathas' outgoings and  the  balances
    in his bank statements and to do so would necessarily risk a  situation
    in which the appellant and her husband have available  to  them  a  sum
    which falls well  short  of  the  Minimum  Income  Requirement  despite
    Mohanathas' income.  What the appellant must show, therefore,  is  that
    Mohanathas has residual disposable income which makes up the  shortfall
    in the �18,600 required by Appendix FM.

54. The shortfall in question is  �18600  less  the  sponsor's  pension  of
    �7500, so something in the region of �11,000 per annum.  The  appellant
    and her husband live with Mohanathas  and  eat  their  meals  with  his
    family.  They are not required to contribute to  the  mortgage  or  the
    bills.  Mohanathas says in  his  statement  that  he  also  gives  them
    between �200 and  �400  per  month  for  sundry  expenses.   There  was
    sensibly no suggestion on  Mr  Whitwell's  part  that  this  claim  was
    untrue, and it chimes with the general thrust of the evidence, which is
    that Mohanathas is only too pleased to be able to  support  his  mother
    and father as they grow older as a part  of  the  family  unit  he  has
    established in Dunstable.

55. In MM (Lebanon) v SSHD,  however,  the  Supreme  Court  underlined  the
    importance of what had been said by Collins J in R (Arman Ali)  v  SSHD
    [1999] EWHC 830 (Admin); [2000] Imm AR 134 and by Lords Brown and  Kerr
    in Mahad v ECO [2009] UKSC 16; [2010] 1 WLR 48.  Those comments related
    specifically to promises of long-term third party support  which  might
    suffice to meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules prior to  the
    introduction of Appendices FM and FM-SE.   Applied  to  the  submission
    made by Ms Revill, those dicta  underline  the  caution  with  which  I
    should  approach  the  suggestion  that  Mohanathas  can  make  up  the
    shortfall in the sum required by the Minimum Income Requirement.  There
    is no schedule of his outgoings.  It is clear from his bank  statements
    that he is a man who is living within his means.  On  occasion,  as  Mr
    Whitwell established by reference to one bank statement, he has  fallen
    into  his  overdraft  facility.   Whilst  he  able  to   maintain   and
    accommodate  his  parents  without  difficulty,  there  is  no   proper
    evidential basis upon which to conclude that he has a spare �11,000 per
    annum with which to make up the shortfall under the Immigration  Rules.



56. It is for those reasons that I do not  accept  Ms  Revill's  submission
    that the public interest in the maintenance of an effective immigration
    control is reduced because Mohanathas  and  her  husband  are  able  to
    support the appellant to the extent  required  by  the  Minimum  Income
    Requirement in  Appendix  FM.   The  evidence  does  not  support  that
    submission and I weigh against the appellant her inability to meet  the
    Immigration Rules, which are  statements  of  policy  to  which  proper
    weight must be accorded at a general level, whilst always ensuring that
    the end result is consistent with Article 8 ECHR: GM (Sri Lanka) v SSHD
    [2019] EWCA Civ 1630; [2020] INLR 32, at [28].

57. I accept Ms Revill's submissions that the appellant  entered  lawfully;
    that her inability to meet the Financial Requirements  stems  from  her
    husband's retirement; and  that  she  does  not  seek  to  present  the
    respondent with a fait accompli of the type encountered in some of  the
    reported decisions.  The public  interest  in  the  maintenance  of  an
    effective immigration control might not sound against her as loudly  as
    it would in such a case but it is nevertheless  a  matter  to  which  I
    attach weight.

58. Ms Revill also submits that the appellant  is  financially  independent
    for the purposes of s117B(3) of the 2002 Act.  In Rhuppiah v  SSHD,  it
    was agreed between the parties, as a  result  of  the  decision  in  MM
    (Lebanon) v SSHD,  that  this  provision  referred  to  an  absence  of
    financial dependence upon the state: [55].

59. It is necessary when considering that submission to have regard to  the
    whole of s117B(3), which states that:

    (3)  It is in the public interest, and in particular in  the  interests
         of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that persons  who
         seek to enter or remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  are  financially
         independent, because such persons -

         (a)  are not a burden on taxpayers, and

         (b)  are better able to integrate into society.

60. Ms Revill submits that the appellant has never drawn  on  public  funds
    and that she and  her  husband  are  fully  maintained  by  Mohanathas.
    Insofar as that submission concerns  the  appellant's  need  for  food,
    clothing and accommodation, I  have  no  difficulty  with  it  at  all.
    Although Mohanathas cannot demonstrate that he has a spare  �11,000  so
    as to make good the  shortfall  under  the  Financial  Requirements  of
    Appendix FM, he is plainly able to feed,  clothe  and  accommodate  his
    parents.  The difficulty which Ms Revill faces in  this  submission  is
    with reference to the appellant's recourse to the NHS.

61. I spent some time with the advocates at  the  hearing  considering  the
    appellant's entitlement to access free treatment on the NHS.  As I have
    recorded above, she entered the UK with leave to enter as a spouse.  It
    was common ground that she would have been entitled to  free  treatment
    on the NHS whilst she held leave in that capacity.  Her leave to  enter
    was extended by operation of statute (section 3C of the Immigration Act
    1971) whilst her in-time application for further leave as a spouse  was
    under  consideration.   Ms  Revill  initially   submitted   that   this
    entitlement came to an end when the appellant received a refusal  which
    was certified under s94 of the 2002 Act, which did not attract  an  in-
    country right of appeal.

62. In exploring the chronology a little further, however, it  was  finally
    agreed between the advocates that the position  was  as  follows.   The
    appellant's leave did come to an end when the  respondent  refused  her
    application and certified it as clearly unfounded on 28  January  2017.
    The application for judicial review which followed  obviously  did  not
    have the effect of extending the applicant's leave  under  section  3C.
    The application for judicial review was settled  by  consent,  however,
    with the respondent agreeing to reconsider the certified  decision  and
    to pay the costs of the application.  Mr Whitwell  was  constrained  to
    accept, in those circumstances, that the decision of  28  January  2017
    had been withdrawn and that  the  application  for  further  leave  was
    consequently pending before the respondent until it was refused  on  14
    May 2018.  The appellant's was extended to that point, and  whilst  her
    appeal was pending thereafter.  It was therefore accepted on all  sides
    that the appellant should be treated as having had valid leave to enter
    as a spouse from her entry in 2014 until she exhausted  her  rights  of
    appeal against the  14  May  2018  decision,  on  7  March  2019.   Her
    entitlement to free treatment on the NHS continued to that point.

63. I was initially concerned that the respondent had not refused the  case
    on the Suitability ground at S-LTR 4.5[1].  It occurred to  me  that  I
    should perhaps disregard the cost to  the  NHS  in  the  absence  of  a
    suggestion that this ground of refusal applied.  But that would  be  to
    overlook the chronology in this case, given that the  most  significant
    costs to the NHS accrued after  the  refusal  dated  25  October  2019.
    Neither advocate submitted that I should disregard the costs to the NHS
    from my proportionality assessment in the absence of such a  ground  of
    refusal.

64. All of the NHS treatment I have summarised at [30] above  was  received
    at a time when the appellant was unlawfully  present  in  the  UK.   Ms
    Revill accepted that the appellant was not entitled to  that  treatment
    free of charge.  The appellant stated that the sponsor had  been  asked
    about the cost of her treatment.  The sponsor stated that  he  had  not
    been asked about this by the NHS.  Ultimately, I do not think  that  it
    matters whether the sponsor has been asked or not;  Ms  Revill  accepts
    that there must be a significant sum[2] which is payable to the NHS  as
    a result of the liver transplant, the inpatient  treatment  thereafter,
    and the ongoing care which the appellant is  presently  receiving  from
    the NHS.   Despite  the  food,  clothing  and  accommodation  which  is
    provided to her by her son and husband, there can be no doubt that  she
    has been a significant burden on  the  taxpayer  and  that  she  cannot
    properly be said to be financially  independent  for  the  purposes  of
    s117B(3).

65. Ms Revill submitted before the FtT that the appellant must be taken  to
    speak English because she was granted entry clearance as  a  spouse  in
    2014.  Appendix FM  was  certainly  in  force  at  that  date  and  the
    appellant would have been required to show that  she  met  the  English
    Language requirement of having passed an English language  test  of  at
    least level A1 on the CEFR.  Had that submission stood alone,  I  would
    have had some difficulty accepting it in the absence of  any  evidence.
    There is no evidence of the certificate which was shown  to  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer.  The appellant gave evidence through an  interpreter
    before me.  I do not understand why I am asked to make  assumptions  in
    this respect when the evidence could easily have been produced.

66. That submission does not stand alone.  Ms Revill also relied  upon  the
    fact that the appellant is over 65 and would be exempt from the English
    Language requirement in the  Immigration  Rules  at  the  date  of  the
    hearing.  Mr Whitwell had no answer to that submission, which seems  to
    me to be sound.  If as a matter of policy the  respondent  has  decided
    that those who are over 65 need not establish their proficiency in  the
    English language, it cannot be right to add  the  appellant's  apparent
    inability to speak the language to the list of points which militate in
    favour of immigration control.  I treat that as a  neutral  matter,  in
    accordance with Rhuppiah v SSHD.

67. Nor do I consider s117B(4) or (5) to militate against the appellant  to
    any  significant  extent.   As  to  sub-section  (4),  the  appellant's
    relationship with her husband was not formed at a time when she was  in
    the United Kingdom unlawfully.  Their relationship was  not,  in  fact,
    formed in this country at all, but in Sri Lanka in the 1970s.   In  any
    event, the appellant entered the United Kingdom lawfully, as a  spouse,
    in 2014 and her presence in the UK  must  be  taken,  for  the  reasons
    above, to have been lawful up to March 2019.  There has certainly  been
    a period of unlawful residence for the subsequent two and half years or
    so but that does not appear to be the mischief  to  which  s117B(4)  is
    directed;  it  makes  specific  reference  to  the   formation   of   a
    relationship at a time when the individual is in the UK unlawfully.

68. As for s117B(5), it is firmly established that it strikes only  at  the
    weight to be attached to a private life during  periods  of  precarious
    stay in the UK: Lal v SSHD [2019] EWCA Civ 1925; [2020] 1 WLR  858,  at
    [58].  Whilst that provision renders it appropriate  to  attach  little
    weight to the appellant's private  life,  including  her  relationships
    with people outside Mohanathas' house, it has no effect on the weight I
    should attach to  the  relationships  at  the  centre  of  Ms  Revill's
    argument.

69. I now draw the threads together and balance the matters militating  for
    and against the appellant in the scales of proportionality. On the  one
    hand is the very real human cost of the appellant's removal.  She  will
    lose  regular  face  to  face  contact  with  her  children   and   her
    grandchildren, to whom she has become very close since entering the  UK
    lawfully seven years  ago.   Those  relationships  will  have  deepened
    further still whilst the appellant was significantly  unwell  in  2020.
    There will, as I have set  out  above,  be  some  impact  on  the  best
    interests of the children (particularly the older children) as a result
    of her removal. The appellant's removal will also present  her  husband
    with an invidious choice, of staying in the country  to  which  he  has
    become accustomed since 1994 or returning to Sri Lanka to be  with  his
    wife.  For the reasons I have given above, I think it more likely  than
    not that he will leave his children and grandchildren  in  the  UK  and
    return with his wife of 44 years to Sri Lanka.  Aside from the loss  of
    contact with his children and grandchildren, he  will  no  longer  have
    ready access to the NHS and he will have to return to the UK every  two
    years in the event that he does not wish his ILR to lapse.   I  do  not
    underestimate any of these consequences, and they are offset to only  a
    limited extent by the presence of siblings in Sri  Lanka,  the  support
    they would receive from the UK, and the likely visits  from  Mohanathas
    and other family members.

70. On the other hand, I have found there to be  powerful  public  interest
    considerations which favour the appellant's removal.  She is unable  to
    meet the Immigration Rules, which are statements of policy to  which  I
    am required to attach weight.  I have rejected Ms  Revill's  submission
    that the appellant is able to meet the substance of the Minimum  Income
    Requirement by reference  to  her  son's  income.   The  weight  to  be
    attached to the maintenance of an effective  immigration  control,  and
    specifically the public interest in the consistent application  of  the
    Minimum Income Requirement, militate against the  appellant.   Of  much
    greater significance, however, is the point  which  Mr  Whitwell  quite
    properly put at the forefront of his oral submissions: the accrued  and
    ongoing cost to the NHS of the appellant's presence in the UK.  She has
    received a liver transplant and lengthy inpatient  treatment  to  which
    she was not entitled.  She continues  to  receive  follow-up  care  and
    medication to which she is not entitled.  She and the sponsor  seem  to
    have proceeded on the basis that she could receive treatment if she had
    a pending application or appeal.  That is evidently not the case and it
    is rightly accepted by Ms Revill that there is a significant sum  owing
    to the NHS for the appellant's treatment.

71. I have found above that the burden on the NHS falls within the scope of
    s117B(3) of the 2002 Act.  Whether or not that is correct, it is  quite
    clear that such matters fall within the scope of Article 8(2)  as  they
    bear directly on the economic wellbeing of the country.  As  the  Upper
    Tribunal held in Akhalu [2013] UKUT 400 (IAC), the existence of such an
    impermissible burden on  the  limited  resources  of  the  UK's  health
    services speak cogently in favour of removal.  I  consider  that  those
    observations apply with some force in the present appeal and that there
    is a cogent public interest in the appellant's removal as a result.

72. Taking all relevant matters above into account, I  come  to  the  clear
    conclusion that the consequences  to  the  appellant  and  her  family,
    whilst serious, are not unjustifiably harsh.  She  can  and  will  live
    with her husband in Sri Lanka and the upset  and  hardship  which  that
    will  certainly  cause  are  justified  by  the  public   interest   in
    maintaining  an  effective  immigration  control  and  protecting   the
    economic wellbeing of the country.



Notice of Decision

The decision of the FtT has been set aside in part. I  remake  the  decision
on the appeal by dismissing it on human rights grounds.

No anonymity direction is made.

                                                                29 July 2021

[1] S-LTR.4.5. One or more relevant NHS bodies has  notified  the  Secretary
of State that the applicant has failed to pay  charges  in  accordance  with
the relevant NHS  regulations  on  charges  to  overseas  visitors  and  the
outstanding charges have a total value of at least �500.
[2]  I  canvassed  with  the  advocates   the   possibility   of   obtaining
confirmation from the NHS of the  precise  sum  but  they  were  content  to
proceed  on  the  basis  that  the  appellant  had  received   'significant'
treatment to which she was not entitled.
