Representation:

For the Appellant:      Mr N Ahluwalia, Counsel, instructed by Bankfield
                  Heath Solicitors
For the Respondent:   Miss S Ahmad, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the Appellant against the decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Davies (the judge), promulgated  on  15  June  2016,  in
    which he dismissed the appeal on all grounds.   That  appeal  had  been
    brought against the Respondent's decision  of  2  July  2015,  refusing
    protection and human  rights  claims.   The  Appellant  is  an  Iranian
    national and is married, his wife being a dependant upon his claim.

 2. The couple's protection claim was essentially based on the  claim  that
    they had converted from Islam to Christianity whilst  in  Iran.   As  a
    result of this they had had problems there and would,  if  returned  to
    that  country,  be  persecuted  for  the  Convention  reason  of  their
    religion.





The judge's decision

 3. The judge sets out the Appellant's case, the evidence before  him,  and
    the representative's submissions. His findings begin at  paragraph  53.
    That paragraph begins with the very clear statement  that  he  had  "no
    hesitation" in concluding that both the Appellant and his wife had lied
    to him regarding the circumstances of their journey from  Iran  through
    Europe to the United Kingdom. Those untruths,  it  was  said,  directly
    impinged on the findings relating to credibility as a whole.

 4. Paragraph 54  provides  a  lengthy  and  forthright  rejection  of  the
    Appellant's evidence as to their journey from Iran to this country.  As
    a result of his primary findings of adverse credibility on the  journey
    issue, the judge goes on at paragraphs 55, 56, 57 and 58 to reject  all
    other evidence in respect of the claimed  conversion  to  Christianity,
    including that of witnesses holding  particular  positions  within  the
    church.

 5. At paragraph 59 the judge concludes that the neither Appellant nor  his
    wife were genuine converts from Islam to Christianity. He  goes  on  to
    say that the suggestion that there was a risk on return on the basis of
    being a Christian convert was "fanciful". At  paragraph  60  the  judge
    concludes that even if he had found the Appellant and his  wife  to  be
    genuine converts, they would not evangelise upon return to Iran.  It is
    said that the Appellant and his wife would be well aware of  the  risks
    to them of doing so. Therefore, no risk would arise in  any  event.  In
    light of this the appeal was dismissed on all grounds.

The hearing before me

 6. I did not call on Mr Ahluwalia to make submissions.  Miss Ahmad briefly
    submitted that the judge was entitled to place weight on the  issue  of
    the journey to the United Kingdom. She had nothing further to add.

Decision on error of law

 7. In my view there are clear  material  errors  of  law  in  the  judge's
    decision.

 8. It is true that issues arising  under  section  8  of  the  Asylum  and
    Immigration (Treatment of Claimants etc.) Act 2004 are,  in  the  first
    instance, for the judge to assess.  However, it is also right that such
    credibility matters must be looked at in the round, together  with  the
    rest of the evidence: they are not simply  a  starting  point  (see  SM
    [2005] UKAIT 116).

 9. In the present case the judge has started his credibility findings with
    the section 8 issue, namely the journey from Iran to this country.  The
    adverse findings on this issue  are  stated  in  a  forthright  manner.
    Having regard to the decision as a whole, it is clear  to  me  that  in
    reality the adverse credibility conclusions reached on the issue of the
    journey have had an overwhelmingly negative impact on  everything  else
    that follows. With respect to the judge, it appears to me as though the
    section 8 issue has  been  both  the  starting  point  and  indeed  the
    finishing point as well: credibility has not  been  looked  at  in  the
    round.  I say this for the following reasons.

10. First, the very first line of paragraph 55 (which of course immediately
    follows the adverse findings relating to the section  8  issue)  states
    that, "I conclude that the Appellant's claim to have been converted  to
    Christianity and attended in house churches in Iran to be false  taking
    into account both his and his wife's lack of credibility with regard to
    their journey to the United Kingdom".  In my view this gives the  clear
    impression that the core element of the  Appellant's  whole  claim  was
    being rejected as a direct  result  of  the  adverse  findings  on  the
    section 8 issue.

11. Second, at paragraph 56 the judge refers once again to the findings  on
    the journey and once again pegs the lack of credibility in  respect  of
    the section 8 issue to  the  rejection  of  the  core  element  of  the
    Appellant's account.  The approach to  the  section  8  issue  and  its
    obvious predominance in respect of the rest of the credibility findings
    is erroneous and is clearly material to the outcome of the appeal.

12. On this basis alone I would set aside the judge's decision.

13. There are, however, other material errors of law in the decision.

14. At paragraph 57 the judge rejects the evidence of two church  officials
    as being in his words, "na�ve" in respect of their  assessment  of  the
    genuineness of the Appellant's conversion to Christianity.  There is no
    independent reasoning as to why he has reached  this  conclusion.  What
    follows in the remainder of that paragraph appears to me to proceed  on
    the assumption  that  the  Appellant's  case  had  already  been  found
    incredible, and therefore everything that the Appellant had been  doing
    was geared towards the fabrication of his account.

15. At paragraph 58 the judge makes reference to  supporting  evidence  and
    again seems to be suggesting that the witnesses were  either  na�ve  or
    lax in their consideration as to whether the  Appellant  was  indeed  a
    genuine convert.  The judge states that the  evidence  "overwhelmingly"
    indicates that the Appellant and his wife were  using  Christianity  to
    seek to remain in the United Kingdom.  Again, there was no  independent
    reasoning as to why all of the relevant evidence was being rejected.

16. I find that the judge has failed to have any regard to what on the face
    of it was important written evidence from  two  other  church  sources,
    namely the Reverend Canon Richard White of Liverpool Cathedral  and  Mr
    Fenelon Broqurt (all contained in the Respondent's  bundle).  This  was
    clearly potentially supportive, and it required addressing.   The  lack
    of reasoning and a failure to have regard to relevant evidence is  also
    a material error of law.

17. The judge has also materially erred in respect of the issue of risk  on
    return.  In concluding that the risk on return simply on the  basis  of
    being a Christian convert was "fanciful", he appears to have overlooked
    the Respondent's own Country Information  and  Guidance  (contained  at
    page 104 of the Appellant's bundle), which provides quite the  opposite
    conclusion, namely that Christian converts are at risk  of  persecution
    on return to Iran.

18. Finally, the judge has misdirected himself as to the application of the
    important principle in HJ (Iran) [2010] UKSC 31.  At paragraph  60  the
    judge finds that the Appellant and his wife would not  evangelise  upon
    return to Iran because they would have been well aware of the risks  in
    doing so. But of course HJ (Iran) tells us that those who would  desist
    from engaging in activities that they would otherwise wish to engage in
    order to avoid the risk of  persecution  are  nonetheless  entitled  to
    succeed in a claim for international protection. The  judge's  approach
    constitutes a further material error of law.

19. I set aside the judge's decision.

Disposal

20. This appeal must be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal.  There will be
    a complete rehearing of the appeal, with no findings from  the  judge's
    decision preserved.  I will issue relevant directions.

Notice of Decision

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.

I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

I remit the case to the First-tier Tribunal.


Anonymity

Unless and until a tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
