                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


The History of the Appeal

1.   The Appellant, Miss Rungnapa Amsri, who was born on 17  June  1998  and
    is a citizen of Thailand, applied  for  entry  clearance  to  join  her
    mother, Mrs Nangnoi Bualom, as her child under  paragraph  297  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  Her appeal against the ensuing refusal was heard by
    Immigration Judge Turquet sitting at Hatton  Cross  on  12  July  2013.
    Both parties were represented, the  Appellant  by  Mr  Solomon.   In  a
    determination of 19 July, promulgated on 26 July, 2013, the appeal  was
    dismissed under the Immigration Rules.

2.   The Appellant's application for permission to appeal, settled in  great
    detail by Mr Solomon, was refused on 6 September 2013 by Judge Astle on
    the basis that it  represented  only  disagreement  with  the  judicial
    findings, but granted on 22  November  2013  by  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    Freeman on the basis that arguably not all relevant evidence was  taken
    into account.  This exactly encapsulates the issue in this  challenging
    appeal.

3.   At the error of law hearing before us on 7 January  2014,  the  Sponsor
    was present and the proceedings were interpreted to her.  The  hearing,
    which lasted almost an hour, took the form of submissions,  Mr  Solomon
    developing the permission application and Mr  Bramble  responding.   We
    are indebted to both of them for cogent, cerebral  and  not  overstated
    submissions, which have greatly assisted us.

The Core Issues

4.   There are two related core issues which run through the argument.

5.   The first core issue is whether Judge Turquet did not take  account  or
    sufficient account of relevant evidence.   A  judge  need  not  discuss
    every detailed aspect of the evidence, especially in an appeal such  as
    this in which the evidence is copious.  But he or she must take account
    of evidence which is significant and relevant to an issue which  arises
    for decision.

6.   The second core issue is whether the conclusions of Judge Turquet  were
    unreasoned or insufficiently reasoned.  As recently  reiterated  in  MK
    (duty to give reasons) Pakistan [2013] UKUT 00641 (IAC), , it was  held
    that axiomatically a determination must clearly  disclose  the  reasons
    for a decision and that  reasons  for  rejecting  oral  or  documentary
    evidence must be given.

7.   We identify a third core issue, which is that a determination  must  be
    read holistically.  Especially in an appeal  like  this  one  in  which
    there is a great deal  of  evidence,  a  determination  which  repeated
    evidence in  each  context  in  which  it  was  relevant  would  assume
    inordinate length.  If a determination addresses evidence at one point,
    the onus is upon the party seeking to challenge it to establish that in
    a  chain  of  reasoning  at  another  point  it  had  escaped  judicial
    consciousness.  So, for example, the submissions of the representatives
    at paragraphs 18 and 28 of the  determination  (referred  to  as  (18),
    (28)) and the Respondent's case (20 to 27) is to be taken to be  within
    the consciousness of the judge throughout the determination unless  the
    contrary can be inferred.


The Essence of the Determination

8.   The key issues under  paragraph  297  of  the  Immigration  Rules  were
    whether the Sponsor had  sole  responsibility  for  the  Appellant  and
    alternatively whether there were serious and compelling family or other
    considerations  which  made  the  Appellant's  exclusion  from  the  UK
    undesirable and suitable arrangements had been made for her  care.   As
    to the first issue of sole responsibility, the key judicial finding  is
    in paragraph 43, which begins:

         "Given the inconsistencies in the accounts, I cannot  rely  on  the
         veracity of the evidence in respect  of  the  Sponsor  having  sole
         responsibility."


    The Respondent argues that these inconsistencies are the basis for  the
    rejection of evidence going to the issue of sole  responsibility.   The
    Appellant argues that the rejection of what is said  to  be  consistent
    evidence on different aspects  of  sole  responsibility  given  by  the
    Appellant, the Sponsor, the Sponsor's husband and the  aunt  with  whom
    the  Appellant  lives  in  Thailand  is  unreasoned  or  insufficiently
    reasoned.  This, we conclude, is the core issue  in  the  appeal,  from
    which most of the other issues follow.

9.   The judge identified inconsistencies within the evidence  about  visits
    to Thailand by the Sponsor and her husband  (31),  photographs  of  the
    Appellant (33), money transfers (34), the knowledge of the Sponsor  and
    her husband about money transfers (34), the finances of the Appellant's
    aunt (34), control of the  Appellant's  education  (35),  school  trips
    (35), with whom the Appellant was or was not able to  discuss  problems
    (35), the Sponsor's evidence about contact and responsibility (36), the
    Appellant's schooling arrangements (37), the  ability  or  not  of  the
    Appellant's aunt to care for her (41)  as  well  as  issues  previously
    identified (41) and the Appellant's contact with her father  (42).   It
    is argued that some of these instances are either  not  inconsistencies
    (for example understanding of distances may be relative  (31)).   These
    we discuss below in relation to the specific grounds of the  permission
    application.

10.  The judge heard evidence from the Sponsor and her husband (2)  and  had
    statements from  them  and  from  the  Appellant  and  her  aunt.   The
    Appellant argues that this evidence was broadly consistent.  Even if it
    was broadly consistent, it was not entirely so.  For example  the  oral
    evidence of the Sponsor's husband was inconsistent  with  that  in  his
    statement (34), which  is  itself  a  mirror  image  of  the  Sponsor's
    statement.

11.  There is no apparent basis for inferring that the judge  did  not  have
    all of this evidence in her mind when she considered what she found  to
    be  inconsistencies  within  it.   Even  if  some  of  those   asserted
    inconsistencies may require some  qualification,  they  afford  in  the
    aggregate ample justification for  the  conclusion  which  she  reached
    which was that she could not rely on the veracity of  the  evidence  in
    respect of the Sponsor having sole responsibility  for  the  Appellant.
    So this finding was judicially open to her.  Hence, in relation to each
    of the specific grounds of the permission application,  the  submission
    of no or insufficient reasoning will not stand.

12.  Against this  background  we  consider  each  of  the  grounds  of  the
    permission applications.

The Specific Grounds of Appeal of the Permission Applications

Ground 1. Sponsor's Visits

13.   The  judge  gave  reasons  for  rejecting  the  evidence,  which   are
    sufficient even if the  relative  perception  of  distance  is  not  an
    inconsistency.  Corroboration is not as a matter of law  required,  and
    the  judge  did  not  erroneously  suggest  that  it  was  needed,  but
    corroborative evidence from the hotel might have addressed the  judge's
    concerns about the evidence.

Ground 2. Photographs

13.  The photographs of the Appellant are school photographs,  mostly  of  a
    group and one of the Appellant individually.  The judge was entitled to
    doubt the shyness of the Appellant in  front  of  the  camera.   Again,
    whilst corroborative evidence is not as a matter of law  required,  the
    judge was entitled to note  the  absence  of  any  photographs  of  the
    Appellant and the Sponsor together, despite the Sponsor's evidence,  at
    pages 8 and 9 of the Appellant's  bundle,  that  she  had  visited  the
    Appellant eleven times over the last eight and a half  years,  with  no
    explanation save that of the Sponsor's husband that the camera had been
    lost.

Ground 3. Money Transfers

14.  The judge noted two plus three plus more  money  transfers  (34,  first
    sentence).  The separate copy of the money transfer  of  ï¿½1,000  on  28
    December 2011 which is in the Respondent's bundle and which Mr  Solomon
    told us that he could not locate is on the Tribunal file as a  separate
    document and was presumably handed to the  judge  during  the  hearing.
    Both are photocopies, so that neither is an original.  The  one  handed
    to the judge shows the  name  of  the  receiver,  whilst  that  in  the
    Respondent's bundle does not.  The judge  was  entitled  to  note  this
    fact.

15.  The Appellant submits that this matter was not put to  the  Sponsor  at
    the hearing, and that this was a  procedural  irregularity.   In  cases
    with much  documentary  evidence  such  as  this  one,  points  can  be
    identified by the judge after the hearing which were not raised  during
    it.  It is not invariably  a  procedural  irregularity  to  note  these
    points.  Whether fairness demands that the point be put to the parties,
    by way of directions or of reconvening the  hearing,  is  a  matter  of
    judicial judgement, depending upon the significance of the issue to the
    appeal.  The point was one of numerous matters  upon  which  the  judge
    expressed her concerns and it was not of such subtlety  that  it  could
    not been anticipated and addressed by counsel at the hearing.   In  our
    view it was not sufficiently significant to have required her to afford
    the parties the opportunity to comment before noting the point.

16.  The Sponsor's memorandum of statement on parental power over  child  of
    19 July 2012 at page 38 of the Appellant's bundle was made in readiness
    for the application which was submitted on 26 July 2012.   Although  Mr
    Solomon submits that it is a significant document,  it  reiterates  the
    Sponsor's written and oral evidence and adds nothing to it except legal
    formality.   The  judge  took  into  account  the  documents   in   the
    Appellant's bundle (3(b)), and it was not an error of law for  her  not
    to mention this document individually.

17.  As discussed, the judge was entitled to  doubt  the  evidence  of  sole
    responsibility.  She stated the correct standard of proof (4).  Reading
    the determination as a whole there is no basis for suggesting that  she
    applied a different standard, and the  use  of  the  words  "vague  and
    unconvincing" about the financial  evidence  (34)  does  not  lend  any
    support to this argument.

Ground 4. The Letter from the Appellant's Teacher

18.  This letter, at page 35 of the Appellant's bundle,  together  with  its
    translation, is referred to (35).  In the light of the judge's concerns
    about the evidence of sole responsibility, it is not  possible  to  say
    that it was not given due weight.

Ground 5. The Sponsor's Statement

19.  The judge noted that in her oral evidence the Sponsor did not refer  to
    the evidence in her statement about meeting the needs of the Appellant.
     The grounds submit that she did not have to, because she  had  adopted
    her statement.  One needs to hear,  as  the  judge  did,  the  line  of
    questioning.  Plainly the judge did not derive from the  oral  evidence
    of the Sponsor a sense  of  her  adoption  of  responsibility  for  the
    Appellant.  The judge was entitled to view  this  as  an  inconsistency
    between the written and oral evidence of the Sponsor.

Ground 6. The Ability of the Appellant's Aunt to Care for her

20.  The judge did not reflect the evidence of the  Appellant  at  interview
    that her aunt was not able to look after her any more  because  of  the
    aunt's health.  Had she done so, she would  have  doubtless  identified
    this as another inconsistency  within  the  evidence,  because  of  the
    evidence that the aunt worked and the absence of any  medical  evidence
    about her (41).  So nothing turns on the fact that the  judge  did  not
    specifically address the interview evidence on this point.

Ground 7. Contact between the Appellant and her Father

21.  The Letter from the Appellant's father at page 28  of  the  Appellant's
    bundle, together with its translation, were considered (17), as was the
    evidence of the Appellant, the Sponsor and the aunt about the  father's
    lack of involvement in the Appellant's life.  Against the background of
    the judge's rejection of the evidence of  sole  responsibility  of  the
    Sponsor, the judicial findings about  the  father's  contact  with  the
    Appellant were a reasoned inference from the evidence (42).

Ground 8. Decisions about the Appellant

22.  The statement that there had been no evidence relating to  the  Sponsor
    making decisions about the Appellant's discipline and friendships  (44)
    may, following the rejection of the  evidence  of  sole  responsibility
    (43)  mean  that  there  was   no   accepted   evidence   about   this.
    Alternatively it may be, as submitted,  an  overstatement.   On  either
    basis, the evidence about this matter  was  considered  throughout  the
    determination (10, 11, 14, 15, 16, 35, 36).

Ground 9. The Appellant being uncared for

23.  The judge found that there was  no  evidence  that  the  Appellant  was
    unwell or uncared for (45, 49).   The  domestic  sleeping  arrangements
    were considered (10), but presumably not viewed as being as significant
    as is submitted on behalf of the Appellant.

Ground 10. Conclusion

24.  Reading the  determination  holistically  and  analysing  each  of  the
    detailed grounds of appeal, we conclude that the judge did not fail  to
    take material evidence into  account  and  that  her  conclusions  were
    grounded in the evidence and  sufficiently  reasoned.   Any  individual
    shortcomings within a long and conscientious determination ranging over
    a volume of oral and documentary evidence were not material.  No  error
    of law has been established.  The determination is upheld.

Decision

25.  The determination of the  First-tier  Tribunal  does  not  reflect  any
    error of law and is upheld.
