Representation:
For the Appellant:     no appearance
For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS



 1. The appellant is a citizen of China,  born  on  3  November  1991.  His
    immigration and  criminal  history  is  accurately  summarised  in  the
    respondent's decision to deport him dated 20 March 2015.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge Clough dismissed his appeal for  reasons  set
    out in her decision promulgated on 6 July 2015.

 3. On 7 August 2015 First-tier Tribunal Judge Cox  refused  permission  to
    appeal to the Upper Tribunal, on the view that the adverse  credibility
    findings were more than sufficient to justify dismissal of the appeal.

 4. The appellant renewed his  application  for  permission  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal, which happened to come before me.  On  18  September  2015  I
    granted permission for the following reasons:

         "The renewed grounds at pp.1-9, �1-7, search minutely for error  on
         the facts. It is a marginal question  whether  they  might  contain
         enough to undermine the determination as a whole.

         At p.9, �8, the grounds take a point which was not in the  previous
         grounds. A sentence at�27 of the determination  is  said  to  imply
         that the standard of a real risk is  higher  than  the  balance  of
         probabilities. That might be a slip of  the  pen,  coming  from  an
         experienced judge on the most  celebrated  feature  of  the  asylum
         jurisdiction. However,  it  adds  enough  to  warrant  a  grant  of
         permission."

 5. In a Rule 24 response dated 8 October 2015 the  respondent  submits  as
    follows:

         "3.      ... The judge correctly self-directed herself  as  to  the
             standard of proof at  paragraph  12.  This  self-direction  is
             correctly applied both to past events and future events.

         4.  When  the  determination  is  read  as  a  whole  the   adverse
             credibility findings  are  clear  and  well-reasoned  ...  the
             slight  confusion  at  paragraph   27   is   only   reasonably
             construable as a slip of the pen ... any other  interpretation
             would be irrational.

         5. The other grounds amount to disagreement with clear and reasoned
             findings.

         6. It is not accepted that a material error is identified. All that
             is required is that the determination  should  be  subject  to
             correction by the judge."

 6. The address which the appellant provided  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    shows him as in immigration  detention.  He  was  at  some  later  date
    released on bail. He has not notifed the  First-tier  Tribunal  or  the
    Upper Tribunal of an up to date address. Notice of hearing  was  issued
    to him in accordance with the information on file.

 7. By  letter  dated  7  December  2015  the  appellant's  representatives
    withdrew from acting. There was no appearance by him or on  his  behalf
    at the time fixed for the hearing. Mr Matthews advised that  he  ceased
    reporting to the respondent in accordance  with  conditions  around  11
    weeks ago, and  has  been  listed  (not  for  the  first  time)  as  an
    absconder. In those circumstances, it was appropriate to  proceed  with
    the hearing in his absence.

 8. Mr Matthews' submissions were in accordance with the Rule 24 response.

 9. The appellant's case was always a weak one. Despite the valiant  search
    for error in the first 9 pages of the grounds of appeal, I am satisfied
    that in substance, and taking the determination as a whole, they amount
    to no more  than  disagreement  with  adverse  credibility  conclusions
    reached for legally adequate reasons.

10. At paragraph 27 the judge said that the appellant "... had  not  proved
    even on the balance of probabilities, let alone a real risk, that he is
    and would be identified as a supporter of the pro Tibetan  independence
    movement ...". As identified in the grounds, that implied that  a  real
    risk is a higher standard than  the  balance  of  probabilities,  which
    would be a legal error. However, this is a  highly  experienced  judge;
    the lower standard of proof is one of the most celebrated  features  of
    this jurisdiction; and her determination should be read fairly and as a
    whole, including the correct self-direction on the standard of proof at
    paragraph 12. Bearing in mind also that the case was a  weak  one,  and
    the appellant's preference to abscond rather  than  to  pursue  it  any
    further, I am satisfied that the error was immaterial.

11. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.

12. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
