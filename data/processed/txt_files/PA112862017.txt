For the Appellant:     Mr P Lewis (counsel)
For the Respondent:    Mr S Walker (Home Office Senior Presenting Officer)

                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is the appeal of SA, a citizen of Sri Lanka born 1  April  1976,
       against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal of 11  June  2018  to
       dismiss his  appeal,  itself  brought  against  the  refusal  of  his
       international protection claim on 19 October 2017.


    2. The essence of his claim is this. He was arrested in 1997,  aged  23,
       on suspicion of LTTE involvement, after a  suspicious  death  at  the
       property where he was living attracted the authorities' attention. He
       was released after three days, the security forces  having  satisfied
       themselves that he had no LTTE connections.  From  2005  to  2009  he
       acted as an administrator for the  LTTE  in  India,  whilst  studying
       there, under the command of a man called Mr T. The Appellant,  during
       his last return to Sri  Lanka,  ran  into  Mr  T  by  chance,  around
       December 2012/January 2013. Mr T was subsequently  arrested.  It  was
       claimed that the authorities found a photograph  of  Mr  T  with  the
       Appellant in Mr T's possession, causing them to take an  interest  in
       the Appellant and to visit his family home in Sri Lanka on 16 January
       2016 seeking his whereabouts.

    3.  Finally,  the  Appellant  also  claimed  to  have  been  engaged  in
       activities with the Transnational Government of Tamil Eelam (TGTE) in
       the  United  Kingdom,  fundraising,  attending  events,  distributing
       leaflets, and putting up posters.

    4. The First-tier Tribunal heard the Appellant's appeal, and  found  his
       account of events in Sri Lanka to lack credibility. This was because

      a) The psychiatric report which had attested to the consistency of
         the Appellant's mental presentation with the account he gave was
         unreliable, as it lacked analysis. Besides, "Whilst I have every
         respect for the psychiatrist, to my lay mind the Appellant did not
         appear to be a person who would have difficulty understanding and
         answering questions. I observed the Appellant give evidence and he
         appeared, again to my lay mind, to behave quite normally";




      b) There was no reason why his name would have featured on a stop
         list in 1997 or thereafter, and in any event the authorities had
         released him speedily showing they had no concerns about him at
         that time;


      c) He had been issued with a passport and had regularly crossed the
         border without incident both on his travels to India and the UK;


      d) He could give no details as to the circumstances in which the
         photograph with Mr T might have been taken, and it was implausible
         that Mr T would have retained such a photograph given that Mr T
         himself, as a high-profile former LTTE activist who would
         necessarily realise that he was of potential interest to the
         security forces, would retain evidence that might incriminate
         himself and others;


      e) The documentary evidence provided by the Appellant by way of
         letters from his mother and from a lawyer fell to be approached on
         the Tanveer Ahmed principle: and as the Appellant's oral evidence
         was suspect, so too were they;


      f) The Appellant's asylum claim, heralded by his contact with the
         Home Office on 11 April 2017, long post-dated his the visit to his
         family home in January 2016, and accordingly merited an adverse
         inference applying section 8 of the Asylum and Immigration
         (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004.


    5. As to the risks the Appellant might face on a return  to  Sri  Lanka,
       his activities in the UK with the TGTE were at "the  lowest  possible
       level" ï¿½51. He was not prominent enough to have come to the attention
       of the Sri Lankan authorities via social media or via any agents here
       who might have infiltrated the Tamil diaspora.


    6. Grounds of appeal argued that the First-tier Tribunal  had  erred  in
       law by

     a) Failing to take account of the fact that the Appellant was a low-
        level activist for the LTTE and that there was no evidence to
        indicate that Mr T was a "relatively high profile member of the
        LTTE";




     b) Failing to appreciate that relevant Home Office Guidance showed
        that the Appellant's TGTE activities might well come to attention
        on his return to Sri Lanka, as demonstrated by the approach of the
        Court of Appeal in UB (Sri Lanka).


    7. The First-tier Tribunal granted permission to appeal on 6  July  2018
       on the basis of the ground I have summarised at (b). It did not  rule
       out the pursuit of other grounds, though indicated its own estimation
       of  the  other  points  as  not  themselves  meriting  the  grant  of
       permission to appeal.


    8. Mr Lewis and Mr Walker had had  the  opportunity  to  confer  on  the
       appeal's disposition before the  hearing  started  and  presented  an
       agreed position  to  me,  which  I  shall  incorporate  into  my  own
       discussion of the case below.

Findings and reasons

    9.  As  the  stance  of  the  representatives  comported  with  my   own
       preliminary view of the appeal, I can be brief in my reasons.

   10. Notably one of the express reasons given by the  First-tier  Tribunal
       for  its  finding  as  to  the  Appellant's   credibility   was   his
       presentation as a witness before it. In SS (Sri  Lanka)  [2018]  EWCA
       Civ 1391 the Court of Appeal warned that it would be wrong to  attach
       any significant weight  to  a  Judge's  impressions  of  a  witness's
       demeanour. To do so would have no  rational  basis,  because  of  the
       danger of thereby reflecting  conscious  or  unconscious  biases  and
       prejudices. It was more appropriate to assess evidence by whether  it
       was plausible, consistent with objectively verifiable information and
       consistent with what the appellant had said on other occasions.


   11. As Mr Walker readily acknowledged, here the Judge  relied  partly  on
       the Appellant's demeanour  to  discount  the  expert  evidence  of  a
       qualified psychiatrist regarding his vulnerability. I appreciate this
       was not the entirety of his reasoning, but it  clearly  weighed  with
       him to some degree, and it is not possible to be  confident  of  what
       his conclusions would have been had this error not been made.

   12. The relevance of this error it that it  is  essentially  a  prismatic
       one, which affects the way in which all the evidence  received  below
       was assessed. It is impossible to be confident that the same decision
       would have been reached as to the  Appellant's  credibility  had  the
       Judge lawfully assessed his vulnerability  as  a  witness.  For  that
       reason the appeal must be re-heard for a lawful determination of  his
       credibility to be made.

   13. There is then the question of the risk assessment  conducted  by  the
       Tribunal below. Although any future assessment  of  risk  will  start
       afresh and depend on the future credibility findings, the approach of
       the  First-tier  Tribunal  on  this  occasion  nevertheless  requires
       comment, to avoid a reoccurence of  the  same  oversight.  The  Judge
       accepted that the Appellant was active with the TGTE at a low  level.



   14. In UB (Sri Lanka) [2017] EWCA Civ 85 the Court of Appeal set out Home
       Office  policy  guidance  dated  28  August  2014,  entitled   "Tamil
       Separatism". The Court stressed the absolute duty on the Secretary of
       State to bring relevant Guidance (and the evidence underlying it)  to
       the attention of the relevant Tribunal. The judgment records:

           "12. Annexed to the guidance is the text of two letters from the
           British High Commission in Sri Lanka. This material is
           authoritative and clearly intended to be read with the guidance.
           The first letter is dated 16 April 2014:
                 "Proscribed Terrorist Groups
                 On 1 April 2014, the government of Sri Lanka announced the
                 designation of 16 Tamil Diaspora organisations and 424
                 individuals under the UN Security Council resolution 1373
                 on counter-terrorism. The order was issued by the Secretary
                 of Defence. The government asserts that this action has
                 been taken to stop attempts to revive the LTTE. The BHC
                 [i.e. British High Commission] has asked the government of
                 Sri Lanka to provide evidence to support this decision.
                 Among the organisations proscribed are the Transnational
                 Government of Tamil Eelam (TGTE) and the UK-based Global
                 Tamil Forum (GTF) and British Tamil Forum (BTF). When
                 making the announcement on 1 April, Brigadier Ruwan
                 Wanigasooriya said that individuals belonging to these
                 organisations would face arrest under anti-terrorism laws
                 ... [T]o date, there have been no known arrests based on
                 membership of one of the newly proscribed groups."
           13. The later letter is dated 25 July 2014 and the relevant text
           reads:
                 "The spokesperson from the DIE stated that returnees may be
                 questioned on arrival by immigration, CID, SIS and TID.
                 They may be questioned about what they have been doing
                 whilst out of Sri Lanka, including whether they have been
                 involved with one of the Tamil Diaspora groups. He said
                 that it was normal practice for returnees to be asked about
                 their activities in the country they were returning from.
                 The spokesperson from the SIS said that people being
                 "deported" will always be questioned about their overseas
                 activities, including whether they have been involved with
                 one of the proscribed organisations. He said that members
                 of the organisations are not banned from returning to Sri
                 Lanka, they are allowed to return, but will be questioned
                 on arrival and may be detained.""

   15. Given the acceptance of TGTE involvement, the  Home  Office  guidance
       given prominence in UB (Sri Lanka) was relevant to this appeal in two
       ways.

   16. Firstly it demonstrates that there may be a duty on the Secretary  of
       State's advocate to draw attention to relevant guidance. Secondly, as
       it happens, the guidance in question  is  directly  relevant  to  the
       facts of the instant Appellant's  claim:  the  TGTE  is  one  of  the
       proscribed  groups  involvement  with  which  may   attract   adverse
       attention from the security forces on  a  return.  True  it  is  that
       "members" are identified as having a higher profile, but the  country
       evidence can be read as supporting a broader  class  of  returnee  as
       being of interest, given the possibility of  questioning  for  having
       "been involved with one of the Tamil Diaspora groups". It seems to me
       that any risks arising from the Appellant's return to Sri Lanka  must
       be assessed with this in mind. International protection law does  not
       require a person to dissemble if questioned by the authorities.

   17. The appeal must be re-heard. No findings are to be preserved.

Decision:

    The appeal is allowed to the extent it is remitted back to  the  First-
    tier Tribunal.


Signed:                                            Date: 9 October 2018
