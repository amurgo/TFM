Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms N Mallick of Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, a Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the appellant against a decision of the First-tier
    Tribunal to dismiss his appeal against the respondent's decision of  26
    March 2014 refusing his application for leave to remain on the basis of
    his family and private life in the UK.

Background

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan who was born on 1 January  1978.
    The appellant has a wife and two children in the UK.   The  appellant's
    wife and two children have been issued with removal directions  but  do
    not have a right of appeal separate from that of  the  appellant.   The
    appellant entered the United Kingdom on 4 October 2006  with  leave  to
    enter as a visitor which was valid until  28  February  2007.   He  was
    accompanied by his wife and his son who was then [ ] months old.   When
    his visa expired the appellant, his wife and his son  remained  in  the
    United Kingdom unlawfully.  On [ ] 2007 the appellant's second son  was
    born in the United Kingdom.  On 24 October 2011 the appellant  and  his
    three dependants applied for leave to remain under  Article  8  of  the
    European  Convention  on  Human  Rights.   On  1  February  2012   that
    application was refused with no right of appeal.  On 10  February  2012
    the appellant submitted a reconsideration request to the  Secretary  of
    State.  On 26 March 2014 the Secretary of State refused the request for
    reconsideration and issued the appellant with IS151B notice of  removal
    giving him a  right  of  appeal.   On  9  April  2014  the  appellant's
    representatives  wrote  a  pre-action  protocol  letter  stating   that
    judicial review was to be sought.  The respondent agreed to  reconsider
    the decision and did  so  and  on  26  March  2014  again  refused  the
    application.

The Appeal to the First-tier Tribunal

 3. On 9  April  2014  the  appellant  appealed  against  the  respondent's
    decision to the First-tier Tribunal.  In a decision promulgated  on  10
    September  2015  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Housego   dismissed   the
    appellant's appeal.  The judge found that the appeal had no merit.   In
    considering the position of the appellant's children  the  judge  found
    that it would be reasonable for them to go to Pakistan.

The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

 4. The appellant  sought  permission  to  appeal  against  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's decision to the  Upper  Tribunal.   The  grounds  of  appeal
    assert that the judge made a material error of law in failing  to  give
    proper consideration to the evidence regarding  [S].   It  is  asserted
    that the judge failed to have proper regard to the various reports  and
    that he failed to grasp the extent  of  [S]'s  problems.   It  is  also
    asserted that the  judge  erred  by  failing  to  have  regard  to  the
    conclusions in Dr Halari's  report.   On  28  January  2016  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Hollingworth granted the appellant permission to appeal.
     The grant of permission sets out that it is unclear how the judge  has
    assessed the strength of the elements identified  in  the  reports  and
    that it is arguable that the judge should have attached greater  weight
    to the final conclusions of Dr Halari.

Summary of Submissions

The appellant's submissions

 5. The grounds of appeal assert that the judge made a  material  error  of
    law by failing to give proper consideration  to  the  totality  of  the
    evidence regarding [S].  A number of paragraphs are set  out  from  the
    skeleton argument and  submissions  that  were  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal  judge.   It  is  asserted  that  the  judge  focused  on   an
    observation made in February 2012 by a clinical psychologist that [S]'s
    bilingual background may contribute to his difficulties  but  does  not
    account for the nature of  the  difficulties.   Reference  is  made  to
    paragraph 64 of the decision.  It is asserted that the report  referred
    to by the judge was written prior to [S] commencing school and also  at
    a time when [S] was not using language to communicate.  It is  asserted
    that [S] uses English more than  Urdu  at  home  and  that  the  latest
    reports account for [S]'s ability  to  form  three  word  sentences  in
    English  only  at  present.   It  is  asserted  that  the   judge   was
    unreasonable in making a supposition that [S] speaks Urdu at  home  and
    is bilingual.  It is asserted that this  demonstrates  that  the  judge
    failed not only to grasp the extent of [S]'s problems but has based his
    decision on what is demonstrably false.  It is  further  asserted  that
    the judge repeats the error failing to consider the medical evidence as
    a whole when he decides that [S] is not autistic.  It is asserted  that
    the judge was not qualified to make decide that [S] is not autistic and
    that his circumstances are not assisted by being bilingual.   Reference
    is made to a 2015 review  which  indicates  that  [S]  is  still  being
    supported as an autistic child and  it  is  still  considered  that  he
    suffers from ADHD.

 6. In ground 2 it is asserted that the judge erred in law in that  on  the
    one hand he indicates at paragraph 96 of his decision  that  he  has  a
    preference for Dr Halari's report above all else and yet fails to  have
    regard to her conclusions on risk on return, in which regard she states
    that a return to Pakistan is likely to place [S]  at  risk  of  social,
    emotional and mental deterioration.  Moving him from a country  and  an
    environment where he is doing well at school and at home, where he  has
    developed stability, consistency and he receives the necessary  support
    and interventions, to a country where it is likely  he  will  not  have
    access to such resources.  It is asserted that had the judge adopted  a
    rational approach he would have concluded that it would be unreasonable
    for [S] to return to live in Pakistan.

 7. Ms Mallick at the commencement of the hearing indicated that she wished
    to apply for permission to amend the grounds of appeal to add a further
    ground which in essence was that the judge accepted the evidence of  Ms
    Hussain and yet made contrary findings against her without  giving  any
    reasons why.

 8. In relation to the first ground of appeal  Ms  Mallick  submitted  that
    this concerned [S] mainly.  [S] has severe  developmental  delays.   He
    has been in the UK for over seven years  and  there  are  a  number  of
    reports concerning his developmental delays.  Ms  Mallick  referred  to
    the report of Jenny Head dated 13 November 2012 setting out that  there
    are general developmental delays and  in  which  it  describes  [S]  as
    having significant difficulties with his language, social  interaction,
    communication and play skills.  The report also notes that at home  [S]
    speaks more English than Urdu and often speaks in short sentences.  She
    referred  to  a  report  by  Dr  Okamoto  a  specialist  in   community
    paediatrics.  In that  report  [S]  was  identified  as  having  social
    communication difficulties and that his language  development  is  very
    delayed suggesting a language disorder  and  not  just  a  delay.   She
    referred  to  a  report  from  the  Hounslow  and  Richmond   Community
    Healthcare Speech and Language Therapy Unit.  The report sets out  that
    [S] presents with social communication and attention difficulties which
    are consistent  with  a  provisional  diagnosis  of  autistic  spectrum
    condition and attention  deficit  hyperactivity  disorder.   A  further
    report in 2014 sets out that [S] is able to form simple  sentences  but
    that  in  less  structured  and  busier  environments   including   the
    mainstream classroom [S] has greater difficulty assessing the  language
    used.  Ms Mallick referred to a report by Dr York  a  consultant  child
    and adolescent psychiatrist.  Dr York  concluded  that  it  is  unclear
    whether [S] does have ASD in addition to his  language  disorder.   She
    referred to an  annual  review  in  2014  by  the  Heathfield  Language
    Provision which concluded that  [S]  continues  to  demonstrate  severe
    difficulties with social communication.  She referred to a report by Dr
    Rozmin Halari which concluded that he was of the opinion that [S]  does
    suffer from global developmental delay  and  difficulties  with  social
    communication and interaction.  Dr Halari considered that [S] met  some
    of the criteria of the autistic spectrum condition  and  that  he  also
    suffers from learning difficulties concluding that he is suffering from
    a neuro-developmental delay which at present has a  significant  impact
    on the quality of his life as  well  as  day-to-day  functioning.   She
    submitted that the judge decided outside of his area expertise that [S]
    is bilingual.  She referred  me  to  paragraph  64  of  the  Tribunal's
    decision and asserted that the judge's reliance on  a  comment  in  the
    report of Vera Grant was unsupported by the other evidence in the case.
     She submitted that the judge's conclusion at paragraph 86 that [S]  is
    bilingual  and  that  therefore  coping  with  two  languages  must  be
    detrimental to him infects the findings with regard to whether  or  not
    it would be reasonable for [S] to return to  Pakistan.   She  submitted
    that the judge was not qualified to make the observations that  removal
    of a detrimental factor of having two languages will be advantageous to
    [S].  With regard to the second ground of  appeal  she  submitted  that
    although the judge indicated that he preferred the report of Dr  Halari
    a number of the judge's findings are in contradiction to  that  report.
    Ms Mallick referred me to paragraph 97 of the decision where the  judge
    sets out 'I note also that his situation is not helped by his bilingual
    life, that is not a factor that was considered in Dr Halari's  report'.
    She asserts that the judge does not address what the  report  does  say
    which is that a return to Pakistan is likely to place [S]  at  risk  of
    social emotional and mental deterioration and that removing him from  a
    country and an environment where he is doing well at school and at home
    where he has development stability, consistency  and  he  receives  the
    necessary support and interventions to a country  where  it  is  likely
    that he will not have access to such resources.  Any change to  routine
    or structure is likely to precipitate levels of anxiety  and  distress.
    Removing him from an environment where positive progress can be made to
    one where it is likely that he will not receive such support will  more
    than likely cause significant negative impact  on  his  mental  health.
    The doctor set out that he was not aware of any schools that are  State
    equivalent that cater with similar neuro-developmental difficulties and
    significant learning difficulties.  The  report  concludes  that  [S]'s
    progress is likely to be poor without the present interventions both at
    home and school.  Ms  Mallick  asserted  that  the  judge  should  have
    accepted the conclusions of Dr Halari and that it was  a  contradiction
    in his findings to find that it would  be  reasonable  for  [S]  to  be
    removed to Pakistan.  In relation to the amended ground of  appeal  she
    submitted that there are a great number of mistakes in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's  decision.   The  judge  accepted  the  evidence  of  Robina
    Hussain.  However, Ms Mallick submitted, at paragraph 93 the judge  has
    set out a number of factors including rejection of  the  evidence  that
    the house had been expropriated by others.  This was  in  contradiction
    to the evidence of Ms Hussain who indicated that people had  taken  the
    house over.  He also rejected her evidence that [S] would be  a  pariah
    in Pakistan but did not give any reasons as to why he  did  not  accept
    that element of her evidence.  She submitted that the judge  failed  to
    take into consideration that Ms Hussain was supporting the appellant in
    this country.  She would have to meet those expenses in any event.  She
    submitted that the judge had failed to take into consideration the cost
    of his school in Pakistan which could be in the region  of  �2,000  per
    week.  The judge erred in considering Ms Hussain's income as more  than
    adequate.  She asserted that the judge made irrational  findings.   The
    judge's findings were that the appellants would  be  returning  to  the
    village that they originated from.   There  was  no  specialist  school
    available in that village.  The appellants' home was dilapidated.   She
    submitted that although [S] was in a mainstream  school  he  was  in  a
    specialist unit within that school and was having extreme difficulties.
     All the evidence indicated that [S] would not be  able  to  attend  an
    ordinary school.  She submitted that the judge had not applied the case
    law correctly although the judge had set out  various  provisions  from
    the relevant case  law  he  had  not  applied  those  principles.   She
    submitted that the judge had failed to identify compelling reasons that
    would  justify  the  Article  8  right  of  [S]  who  is   having   his
    developmental needs catered for in the UK to be interfered  with.   She
    asserted that the judge did not look at the child's  education  in  the
    broader sense and had overlooked the fact that there was no  school  in
    the village.  That [S] had never  lived  in  Pakistan  and  would  have
    extreme difficulties in adapting to life in another country.

 9. Mr Tufan submitted that the grounds of appeal centred around  erroneous
    fact-finding that [S] speaks both Urdu and English.  He  has  submitted
    that the judge had considered at paragraph 64 the relevant  facts.   He
    asserted that it was open to the judge to arrive at the conclusion that
    he did given the factual background.  The main appellant speaks  barely
    any English.  It is clear that he must be communicating  in  Urdu  with
    his child.  He referred to page D40 of  the  bundle  where  the  report
    indicates that his language skills in Urdu and English are at a similar
    level.  He referred to paragraph 95  onwards  and  submitted  that  the
    judge gave the  relevant  weight  to  the  report  of  Dr  Halari.   He
    submitted that the matter of the weight to be given to a  report  is  a
    matter for the judge.  He submitted that to overcome the threshold  for
    irrationality was a high hurdle to overcome.   He  submitted  that  the
    negative credibility findings of  the  judge  were  open  to  him.   He
    submitted that Dr Halari in his report indicated that [S] did not  have
    a medical condition.  He referred  to  paragraph  69  and  the  judge's
    finding that the family  house  is  available  to  the  appellant.   He
    submitted that the evidence had been strewn with untruths therefore  it
    was open to him to make the finding that he made and that  the  grounds
    are merely a disagreement with the judge's findings.  He submitted with
    regard to the new grounds of the appeal the judge was correct  to  find
    that Ms Hussain could fund the appellants.  The evidence was  that  she
    was currently funding them.  He submitted that it was  trite  that  the
    cost of living in the UK was much more expensive than in Pakistan.   He
    submitted that it was a red herring that the  cost  of  the  school  in
    Pakistan would be �2,000 a month.  He asserted that that  is  not  what
    the judge says is the cost but that the judge had been advised that the
    cost of privately providing all the support services might  be  in  the
    region of �2,000.

10. Ms Mallick in reply asserted that the judge had failed to consider what
    the best interests of [S] were.  She submitted that the starting  point
    according to ZH  (Tanzania)  is  to  ascertain  what  is  in  the  best
    interests of the children.  The judge  did  not  consider  any  of  the
    factors set out in the relevant case law in determining what a  child's
    best interests are.  She submitted that the  test  for  perversity  was
    made out in this case as it was perverse for the judge to find that  it
    would be reasonable for [S] to return home  to  the  village  in  which
    there were no specialist schools available.  In the UK he  is  educated
    in a specialist unit in the school.  It was therefore perverse that the
    judge should miss the  point  that  help  would  not  be  available  in
    Pakistan.  The cost of privately educating  him  in  the  UK  would  be
    �2,000 a week.  The judge ought to have considered how  much  it  would
    cost in Pakistan to send him to a specialist provider.   She  submitted
    that the report of Jenny Head was a pre-school report when [S] was only
    aged 5 years old and that it simply says that he understood Urdu.   She
    asserted that it is one thing to say that a  person  can  understand  a
    language to jump to say that they are conversant.  There is no evidence
    that [S] was bilingual.

Discussion

11. The grounds of appeal are against the judge's findings in  relation  to
    [S]. There is  no  appeal  against  the  decision  in  respect  of  the
    appellant, his wife or their son Bilal.

12. The focus of the appellant's oral submissions in relation to  ground  1
    centred around the judge's findings that [S] is bilingual and that this
    contributes to his difficulties. It is asserted that the judge did  not
    appreciate the extent of his difficulties. The  appellant  referred  to
    paragraph 64 of the First-tier Tribunal's decision. In  this  paragraph
    the judge was considering the evidence given by the appellant  and  his
    wife. This was part of the credibility assessment. The report  of  Vera
    Grant that the judge referred to was one of the elements that the judge
    was considering when determining the truthfulness of the assertion that
    [S] speaks no Urdu. The judge recorded at paragraph 46 that, in  answer
    to questions from him, the appellant's wife said that  she  spoke  Urdu
    with the children but that they were not fluent. The judge  found  that
    the appellant speaks barely a word of English and that he must speak to
    his children  therefore  in  Urdu  only.  The  concluding  sentence  of
    paragraph 64 is that the judge did not accept  the  appellant  and  his
    wife's evidence that [S] speaks no  Urdu.  In  light  of  the  evidence
    available, there is no error in the judge's finding in respect of  this
    aspect of the appellant and his wife's evidence.

13. The appellant asserts that the judge relied on the report of Vera Grant
    but that this report was out of  date  and  unsupported  by  the  other
    evidence in the case. That is  not  correct.  I  note  that  there  are
    several reports that refer to the home language being Urdu and  to  [S]
    saying words in Urdu. For example, at pages D40, D41, D49 of the bundle
    and many more.  Having perused the evidence in the file I note that  in
    a report dated 1 March 2013 Dr Jenny  Head  notes  that  "his  parents'
    language is Urdu and it is not uncommon for children in bilingual homes
    to experience language delay....  They  are  an  Urdu  speaking  Muslim
    family from Pakistan". However, I accept that  it  is  clear  from  the
    later reports that [S] has developed language skills in English through
    intensive support from the language unit in his primary school.  It  is
    not clear how  much  his  language  skills  in  Urdu  have  progressed,
    although  I  accept  the  judge's  conclusions  that  his  father  must
    communicate with him in Urdu as he speaks very little English  himself.
    I find that it was therefore reasonable for the judge to arrive at  the
    conclusion in paragraph 86 that the children are Urdu speakers. Further
    it is not out with the area of expertise of  the  judge  to  find  that
    [S]'s  difficulties  are  exacerbated  by  his  need  to  converse  and
    assimilate  two  languages.  The  early  reports  note,  as  a  general
    proposition, that children in bilingual families will often  experience
    language delay.

14. I accept that it appears that the judge has  focused  on  the  problems
    arising from the bilingual home environment when assessing  the  extent
    of [S]'s difficulties. For example, in paragraph 86 the judge finds:
         "... To that extent the evidence indicates that for him  to  go  to
         Pakistan will be of assistance to him  as  he  will  only  have  to
         grapple with one language, and that is the  mother  tongue  of  his
         parents. This aspect of matters has simply not  been  addressed  in
         the reports, which are predicated on the needs of [S]  in  the  UK.
         While the reports stress his need for continuity,  and  removal  to
         Pakistan would inevitably be an upheaval and so detrimental in  the
         short term, it must be a relevant factor that (for the reason  that
         he will have only one language to cope with)  the  removal  of  the
         detrimental factor of having two languages will be advantageous  to
         [S]"

15. At paragraph 97 the judge in assessing the report  of  Dr  Halari,  set
    out:
         "... While he benefited from extra help, and  his  language  scores
         are very low percentile terms, I note also that  his  situation  is
         not helped by his bilingual life. This is not a  factor  considered
         in the report..."

16. I do not accept, however, Ms  Mallick's  submission  that  the  judge's
    focus  on  [S]'s  bilingual  background  has   infected   the   judge's
    consideration of the extent of [S]'s  problems.  In  paragraph  94  the
    judge considered [S]'s developmental needs. The judge took full note of
    the expense of the help he received as an indicator of  the  extent  of
    his needs.

17.  The  judge  acknowledged  that  [S]  will  encounter  difficulties  in
    experiencing any change in his life,  "whether  that  is  a  change  of
    school (such as will occur if he were to remain in the UK and change to
    secondary school in the UK or to move house)."

18. At paragraph 97 the judge considered the report of Dr Halari. The judge
    correctly set out that [S] did not have ADHD and that he presented with
    some traits of autism that did not meet the criteria of autism. This is
    taken directly from the findings of Dr Halari. The judge noted that [S]
    has global developmental delay and is in the autistic spectrum but that
    he does not have a medical condition per se. The judge was entitled  to
    rely on the report of Dr Halari and to prefer that evidence. As set out
    by the judge, in paragraph 96, Dr Halari is a specialist doctor and was
    tendered as the expert. I therefore  reject  the  submission  that  the
    judge erred in failing to consider the medical evidence as a whole when
    he decided that [S] is not autistic. It is not clear in any  event  how
    much further that would take the appellant's case  as  (whether  it  is
    diagnosed as autism or not)  the  judge  has  considered  [S]'s  global
    developmental delay and the level  of  support  that  he  is  receiving
    currently when assessing the reasonableness of him leaving the UK.

19. The judge considered in some detail the cost of  private  education  in
    Pakistan. The judge concluded the family  would  be  supported  by  Mrs
    Hussain and that, on her income of around �50,000 a year, the  cost  of
    private education would amount to a modest level of support. The judge,
    having considered the objective evidence, found  that  it  was  in  the
    region of around �40 per month for what was considered to be  expensive
    education. The reference to �2000 a  week  is  taken  from  Dr  Halri's
    report as the estimate of the cost of all the services currently  being
    received if provided privately in  the  UK.  It  is  not  the  cost  of
    assistance in Pakistan. There is no error in the judge's  finding  that
    Ms Hussain would be able to assist the appellant  financially  to  meet
    the cost of education in Pakistan. The judge pointed out, in  paragraph
    90, the education system in Pakistan is not likely to be as good as the
    system in the UK but the judge  found  that  the  education  system  in
    Pakistan is not so inadequate that it would amount to requiring a child
    to be granted leave to remain in the UK. The judge was considering  the
    test as to whether or not it would be reasonable for [S] to  leave  the
    UK. As has been set out in numerous cases it is  not  necessary  for  a
    level of education or health support in the country  of  origin  to  be
    equal to the UK in order for it to be reasonable for a child  to  leave
    the UK. As set out by  Dr  Halari  in  her  report  it  would  be  very
    difficult for [S] to receive the same level of care by a dedicated team
    in Pakistan. The judge took into consideration, at paragraph  87,  that
    [S] will find it difficult in a village location to get the help he now
    receives in the UK. However, there is  no  requirement  that  the  same
    level of care must be available in the country of origin. Although  the
    judge correctly concluded that [S] has not been diagnosed  as  autistic
    but rather shows traits of autism, there are in  any  event  facilities
    available for children with autism. As  set  out  in  the  reasons  for
    refusal letter there are specialist  care  centres  for  children  with
    autism in Lahore, Karachi and Islamabad. Further, in  Rawalpindi  there
    is a self-funded school with 22 autistic children who are taken care of
    by speech therapist, behaviour therapist and a  child  psychologist  as
    well as full participation of their parents.

20. On the evidence considered by the judge and his findings of fact  there
    was no material error of  law  in  the  judge's  finding  that  it  was
    reasonable for [S] to return to Pakistan with his family.

21. In relation to ground 2 it is asserted that the judge  failed  to  have
    regard to Dr Halari's conclusions on risk on return.  At  paragraph  95
    the judge set out:
         "I have considered the report of Dr  Halari  carefully.  There  are
         some risks identified, such as at paragraph 83,  (A2,  report  page
         18) quotation mark having to move to another  country  against  his
         wishes and where the expectations of what life would  be  like  are
         uncertain can render s at risk of significant emotional  distress".
         This is a generic statement of a possibility, but  not  more.   For
         example, his wishes were not ascertained. That the expectations  of
         life would be uncertain is an assumption  predicated  on  what  the
         appellant and his wife told Dr Halari. The appellant and  his  wife
         were, in the one particular in the report  that  can  be  verified,
         Bilal's  place  of  birth,  untruthful,  and  untruthful  in  other
         respects as well, as set out. The report set  out  the  appellant's
         assertions about life in Pakistan and (for example at paragraph  40
         and 57 et seq) and treated these assertions as fact,  so  informing
         the report's conclusions. I do not find that those assertions (upon
         which the report is founded) to be  factually  based.  Accordingly,
         the conclusions of the report have  less  weight  than  their  face
         value."

22. The weight to be afforded to an expert  report  is  a  matter  for  the
    judge. The judge took all the evidence into consideration. A judge does
    not have to set out each individual piece of evidence  considered.  The
    judge set out, at paragraph 43, the documents and the evidence that  he
    had  considered.  The  judge  considered  that  some  of  Dr   Halari's
    conclusions arose from information provided by the  appellant  and  his
    wife. The judge was entitled  to  take  that  into  consideration  when
    deciding what weight to give to the  opinion  in  the  report.  In  the
    grounds of appeal, a number of the points that are  highlighted  relate
    to the prognosis for [S]'s development based on Dr Halari's report that
    it is likely that [S] will not receive support in Pakistan.  The  judge
    took into consideration that there are facilities available that  would
    be accessible given that Mrs Hussain is able to fund private education.
    The judge has taken into consideration Dr Halari's opinion that a  move
    to Pakistan would be detrimental at para 86. The judge  in  considering
    the evidence in the round notes  he  would  have  the  support  of  his
    parents and an extensive family network in Pakistan to  assist  him  in
    settling in Pakistan. On the basis of all the  evidence  available  the
    conclusion of the judge that it would be reasonable for [S]  to  go  to
    Pakistan is one that was open to him.

23. Although not set out in the grounds of appeal Ms Mallick asserted  that
    the judge had not identified  what  the  best  interests  of  [S]  are.
    Although the judge has not explicitly made a  finding  as  to  what  he
    considers the best interests are it is clear that the judge  has  taken
    into consideration the duty to consider the best interests of the child
    as a primary consideration. The judge set out at  length  the  relevant
    paragraphs from a number of cases concerning the need to have regard to
    the best interests of a  child  and  the  approach  of  the  court.  At
    paragraph 80 the judge sets out:
         "I have weighed carefully the situation regarding the  children.  I
         bear in mind the guidance in and MK (India) Best interests  of  the
         child) [2011] UKUT 0475, and in EV (Philippines) v SSHD [2014] EWCA
         Civ 874."

24. Whilst it is correct  that  the  judge  ought  to  have  arrived  at  a
    conclusion as to what the best interests  of  the  children  were,  the
    judge has engaged in the process of identifying  those  interests  when
    considering whether or not it would be reasonable for [S] to leave  the
    United Kingdom. I do not consider this error  to  be  material  on  the
    facts of this case as, notwithstanding the failure to make  a  specific
    finding, the judge has discharged the substance of the section 55 duty.
    The judge was  required  to  consider  the  factors  (as  relevant)  as
    identified in the case law when considering the best interests of  [S].
    The judge has identified his particular developmental needs,  the  fact
    that he has been in the UK all  his  life,  that  he  has  had  lengthy
    residence in the UK and has known no other home and  that  he  requires
    extensive help in the UK to meet his needs.  The  judge  weighed  those
    factors in the balance when considering whether  or  not  it  would  be
    reasonable for [S] to leave the UK.  Any error of  law  in  failing  to
    specify what he considered [S]'s best interests  to  be  would  not  be
    material to the outcome of the appeal  based  on  the  judge's  overall
    conclusion that it is reasonable for [S] to go to Pakistan after having
    considered the needs of [S].

25. The third ground of appeal, added at the hearing, was  that  the  judge
    having accepted the evidence of Mrs Hussain and then  rejected  aspects
    of  that  evidence  failing  to  give  any  satisfactory   explanation.
    Reference was made to paragraph 93 where the judge had set out that  he
    rejected the evidence that the house had been expropriated  by  others.
    It is asserted that this is in contradiction  to  the  evidence  of  Ms
    Hussain. At paragraph 58 the judge records Ms Hussain's evidence, which
    was that no one now lives in the house, and at  paragraph  59,  in  re-
    examination, her evidence was that they had tried  to  put  into  court
    that the land belongs to them. At paragraph 69 the judge deals with the
    discrepancy between the appellant's evidence and Ms Hussain's evidence.
    He records that her evidence was that a claim had been made  in  Court.
    That as there was no evidence of that, and because the  appellant  gave
    different evidence, although he accepted that Mrs Hussain believed that
    be the case it was not made clear the reason that  she  believed  that.
    The judge has made clear why he arrived at the conclusion that he  did.
    His conclusion is not in contradiction to the evidence  of  Ms  Hussain
    who clearly stated in oral evidence that no one lived in the house.  Ms
    Mallick submitted that the judge gave no reasons as to why he  rejected
    Ms Hussain's evidence that [S] would be a pariah in Pakistan. The judge
    set out, at paragraph 74, that there was no evidence provided that  [S]
    would be a pariah in Pakistan other than the assertions being  made  in
    oral evidence. The judge considered that Ms Hussain  has  not  been  to
    Pakistan for many years so could have nothing other  than  an  historic
    view. The judge clearly has given a reason as to why he did not  accept
    this assertion of Mrs Hussain.  A judge can accept, in  general  terms,
    that a witness is a witness of truth without accepting that  all  of  a
    witness's beliefs or views,  however  honestly  held,  are  necessarily
    borne out. There is no material error of law in the judge's findings in
    relation to the evidence of Ms Hussain.

26. For the reasons set out above there was no error of law such  that  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside

Notice of Decision

The appeal is dismissed. There was no material error of law  in  the  First-
tier Tribunal's decision.

I  have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  an
anonymity direction. No anonymity  direction  was  made  previously.  Having
considered  all  the  circumstances  and  evidence  I  do  not  consider  it
necessary to make an anonymity direction.
