                             DECISION ON APPEAL

(Note: this case is reported as a convenient summary of the principles in  E
& R [2003] EWCA Civ 49, Ladd v. Marshall [1954] 3 All ER 745, and MA  [2004]
UKIAT 00161*)

   This is an appeal from a decision of  an  adjudicator  (Mrs  CJ  Lloyd),
   sitting at Birmingham on 4 March 2004, dismissing an  asylum  and  human
   rights appeal by a citizen of the Republic of the  Congo  (Brazzaville).
   Permission  to  appeal  was  given  on  the  basis   that,   since   the
   adjudicator's decision, the claimant  had  produced  a  membership  card
   purporting to show he was a member of the party (UPADS)  he  claimed  to
   support.

2. Mr Bedford placed some reliance on that decision, made on 27  May  2004,
   as showing that the production of such  fresh  evidence  could  raise  a
   point of law on the adjudicator's decision. In our view this was  wholly
   misconceived: while the current statutory  position  (requiring  such  a
   point) was established from 9 June 2003, its actual effect was only made
   clear with the decision of the Court of Appeal in  CA  [2004]  EWCA  Civ
   1165, given on 20 July 2004. We have to decide whether the production of
   the card (the only ground relied on as a point of  law  by  Mr  Bedford)
   does indeed amount to one, in the light of CA, and E&R  [2003  EWCA  Civ
   49, as elucidated in MA [2004] UKIAT 00161*. No other point of  law  was
   relied on before us.

3. The adjudicator's findings on the claimant's individual  history  appear
   at her �� 26-31: these begin "I do not believe his involvement in  UPADS
   ...", and, after substantial reasoned  consideration, are summarized  at
   � 30 "All in all, I do not believe the core of the Appellant's claim  to
   have been a UPADS activist who ...".  At  one  point  Mr  Bedford  found
   himself reduced to arguing that these  did  not  amount  to  credibility
   findings. As he was apparently quite serious  in  this  contention,  the
   kindest thing may be simply to say that we found it  wholly  unarguable,
   and pass on.

4. Mr Bedford's next point was that the adjudicator had not  been  entitled
   to make such findings, when the refusal letter had gone no further  than
   (at � 7) to note that "You claim that you are a member  of  UPADS  ...",
   and to conclude (at � 8) that "... it is not accepted  that  you  are  a
   notable political activist for UPADS ...". This too must be regarded  as
   wholly misconceived: there was certainly no acceptance  in  the  refusal
   letter that the claimant had been any kind of member of UPADS,  and  the
   nature of his involvement in it, if any,  was  clearly  in  issue.  That
   remained Mr Russell's position before us, in the light of the card.

5. Mr Bedford appeared for the claimant before the adjudicator,  and  there
   is no suggestion in the grounds of appeal that he or the  claimant  were
   in any way misled by the terms of the refusal letter into  thinking  the
   Home Office accepted that he was a UPADS member at all. We regret to say
   that this point first appeared as part of the claimant's case  in  order
   to forestall a suggestion that the membership card could and should have
   been produced before the adjudicator, and the politest thing we can  say
   about it is that, though it was as opportunistic as it was misconceived,
   the opening for it was simply not given by  the  terms  of  the  refusal
   letter.

6. The claimant called another witness before the adjudicator,  his  cousin
   Wilson Nsika Nkokolo. The adjudicator disbelieved him too, and, even  on
   his own account, they had not been in touch in  the  Congo  after  1997,
   when the claimant left Brazzaville (though the claimant said he had left
   for Pointe Noire in 1995). The suggestion (to explain late production of
   the UPADS card) in the grounds of appeal at � 3 was  that  the  claimant
   had become reconciled with this cousin (there called Nkolo) only towards
   the end of January and "... it was his cousin who only recently  managed
   to make contact with the appellant's wife through use  of  his  contacts
   and requested that the original party card be forward  to  the  UK.  The
   original card was sent by DHL and received by the appellant on  Thursday
   25th March 2004."

7. Mr Bedford was able to tell us no more about the circumstances  of  this
   recent reconciliation, or of how the claimant and his cousin had  fallen
   out in the first place. The claim in � 3 of the grounds must be regarded
   as a wholly unsupported assertion; but, even if that were not so, as  Mr
   Russell pointed out, the order of events given hardly explains  why  the
   card should have been sought for (despite what Mr Bedford said about its
   relevance not being obvious) at some time following a reconciliation  in
   late January, but not received till  after  the  adjudicator  sat  on  4
   March; or why, if it was being sought for, the adjudicator  was  not  at
   least told about that.

8. It is now time to review the facts surrounding the  late  production  of
   the UPADS card in the light of the authorities. The requirements  for  a
   mistake of fact, assuming it showed the adjudicator  had  made  one,  to
   amount to a mistake of law, are given in E&R at � 66 [the lay-out  below
   is ours, but the words are the Court of Appeal's]:

   1. There must have been a mistake as to an existing  fact,  including  a
      mistake as to the availability of evidence on a particular matter.
   2. The fact or evidence must have been "established", in the sense  that
      it was uncontentious and objectively verifiable.
   3. The appellant (or his advisers) must not have  been  responsible  for
      the mistake.
   4. The mistake must have played a material  (not  necessarily  decisive)
      part in the Tribunal's reasoning.

9. The Court of  Appeal  in  E&R   at  �  92  referred  to  the  well-known
   principles in Ladd v Marshall [1954] 1 WLR 1489, set out at  �  23  ii),
   defining the circumstances in which fresh evidence  can  be  allowed  on
   appeal. They are (again in our lay-out and their words) that

   1. The  fresh  evidence  could  not  have  been  obtained  by  reasonable
      diligence for use at the trial.
   2. If given, it would probably have had an  important  influence  on  the
      result; and
   3. It is apparently credible though not necessarily incontrovertible.


10. As the Tribunal pointed out in MA 04-161* at � 15, the Court  of  Appeal
   in E&R made clear at � 92 that they were not dealing  with  the  current
   jurisdiction of the Tribunal, limited to a point  of  law.  It  followed
   that the application of the Ladd v Marshall  principles had to  be  read
   subject to the need for the fresh evidence to establish a point  of  law
   in the E&R  terms, set out at 8. The Tribunal went on to say this:

   When applied in the context of error of law  alone,  the  test  for  the
   relevance of fresh evidence which could and should have been before  the
   Adjudicator cannot now  be  that  it  assists  a  challenge  to  factual
   conclusions such as credibility findings or other personal circumstances
   which are very much matters for the Adjudicator.

   While they examined the evidence of Marie Colvin to see if it  met  this
   requirement, they concluded that it did not: not only did it not raise a
   point of law, but it had been available;  the  claimant's  advisers  had
   simply been ignorant of it.

11. We shall now go on to deal with  the  present  case  on  the  basis  now
   established. Dealing first with the Ladd v Marshall  rules,  we  do  not
   regard it as established, even to a reasonable likelihood  (if  that  is
   the test on a point of this kind), that the UPADS card  could  not  have
   been obtained by reasonable diligence for use  before  the  adjudicator:
   our reasons are given at 7. While it would certainly have been material,
   we do not accept that it would probably have had an important  influence
   on the result. While the adjudicator noted the absence of an UPADS card,
   her reasons for not accepting the claimant's history  went  well  beyond
   that, and did not depend on it.

12. The history  of  the  card  itself  has  not  been  explored  in  cross-
   examination, as it undoubtedly would have been if  produced  before  the
   adjudicator; but, subject to that, we are prepared for present  purposes
   to accept that on its face it is apparently credible;  though  certainly
   not incontrovertible. On the first and second Ladd  v  Marshall   points
   however, even without the need to meet  E&R   requirements,  we  do  not
   regard the card as admissible fresh evidence on appeal to us.

13. Going on to the E&R principles, the existence of a "point of law" in  CA
   terms requires there to have been a mistake as to fact  or  evidence  by
   the adjudicator. While a mistake  as  to  availability  of  evidence  is
   enough,  the  actual  fact  or  evidence  must  be  "uncontentious   and
   objectively verifiable". Clearly  the  claimant's  membership  of  UPADS
   remains contentious, in the sense that it is still not  accepted  by  Mr
   Russell. Mr Bedford suggested that this was immaterial;  but  we  cannot
   regard the existence of a card, on its face showing the claimant  is  or
   was an UPADS  member,  as  "uncontentious  and  objectively  verifiable"
   evidence that he was, in the absence of either acceptance by  the  other
   side, or (for example) a statement from the party itself  confirming  it
   as genuine. While "objectively" may not be limited to facts or  evidence
   verifiable from external sources (as would be  the  case  with  material
   relating to the general political background), we have no doubt that  it
   was intended to govern the meaning of "uncontentious".

14. As we have already pointed out (see 4-5), the  importance  of  producing
   an UPADS card, if there was one, was, or ought to  have  been  perfectly
   clear to the  claimant and his  advisers,  even  on  the  terms  of  the
   refusal  letter.  It  follows  that  they  cannot  be  regarded  as  not
   responsible  for  any  mistake  made  by  the  adjudicator  as  to   the
   availability of such evidence: we return to Mr Russell's point  (see  7)
   as to her not even being told it was, or might be on its way. While  the
   absence of a card was certainly material to the  adjudicator's  decision
   (see 11), she made no mistake on its availability at  the  date  of  her
   decision; and in any case on the second  and  third  E&R  principles  we
   cannot regard its late production as establishing any point of law as to
   the decision's correctness.
