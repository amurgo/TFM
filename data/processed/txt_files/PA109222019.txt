Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Kumar, Optimus Law
For the Respondent:    Mrs Aboni, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant was born on 17 November 1985 and is a female  citizen  of
    Cameroon. She was refused international protection by the respondent by
    a decision dated 29  October  2019.  She  appealed  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal  which,  in  a  decision  promulgated  on  21  February  2020,
    dismissed her appeal. The appellant now appeals,  with  permission,  to
    the Upper Tribunal.

 2. At the initial hearing at Manchester by Skype for Business on  31  July
    2020, Mrs Aboni, who appeared for the Secretary of State, told me  that
    she did not seek to support the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal.
    At [6], the judge had stated that no application had been made  at  the
    First-tier  Tribunal  hearing  for  the  appellant  be  treated  as   a
    vulnerable witness. Mrs Aboni  told  me  that  she  believed  this  was
    incorrect as an application had, in effect, been made in  the  skeleton
    argument produced by  the  appellant's  representatives.  Although  the
    judge records in her decision the allowances  that  she  made  for  the
    appellant's mental health difficulties, crucially no mention  of  those
    difficulties appears to have been taken into  account  in  the  judge's
    analysis of the credibility of the appellant's account.  I  agree  with
    Mrs Aboni that this latter omission  undermined  the  decision  of  the
    judge such that her  decision  should  be  set  aside  and  the  appeal
    determined de novo.



Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside. None of  the  findings
of fact shall stand. The appeal is returned to the First-tier Tribunal  (not
Judge Young-Harry; French interpreter; 1.5 hours;  the  First-tier  Tribunal
sitting at Birmingham; first available date) for  that  Tribunal  to  remake
the decision following a hearing de novo.
