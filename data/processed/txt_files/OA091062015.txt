Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Although this  is  an  appeal  by  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer,  for
    convenience I will refer to the parties as  they  appeared  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal.

Introduction

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan who  was  born  on  21  December
    1986.  He is married to a British citizen, Rozeena Bano Rafiq.

 3. On 5 March 2015, the appellant applied for entry clearance to join  the
    sponsor in the UK as her spouse under Appendix FM  of  the  Immigration
    Rules (HC 395 as amended).

 4. In a decision notice on 7 May 2015 (wrongly dated 7 May 2014), the  ECO
    refused the appellant's application for entry clearance  on  the  basis
    that the sponsor (as a self-employed person) had not  established  that
    her income reached the required amount of �18,600.  In particular,  the
    sponsor's bank statements did not show that  her  income  (received  in
    cash) had been paid into her bank accounts.  As a consequence, the  ECO
    concluded that the appellant had not, on the  basis  of  the  specified
    documents  as  required  under  Appendix  FM-SE,  met   the   financial
    requirement in E-ECP.3.1.  In addition, the ECO refused the appellant's
    application under Art 8 of the ECHR.

 5. On 21 August 2015, the  Entry  Clearance  Manager  affirmed  the  ECO's
    decision.

The Appeal to the First-tier Tribunal

 6. The appellant appealed to the  First-tier  Tribunal.   The  appeal  was
    heard by Judge N J Osborne on 6 April 2016.

 7. Both the sponsor and her father, with whom  the  sponsor  worked,  gave
    oral evidence.  It was accepted before Judge Osborne that  the  sponsor
    had  not  provided  the  full  required  bank   statements   with   her
    application.  However, further documents, including statements had been
    provided after the ECO's decision.  The evidence  was  that  her  gross
    income was �19,356 for the relevant financial year ending  April  2014.
    However, Judge Osborne accepted that the sponsor's bank statements only
    disclosed payments in during the relevant period of �2,000 by an online
    transfer and �3,334 as a result of a payment in  of  a  cheque.   Judge
    Osborne accepted that the additional bank statements, available at  the
    appeal, demonstrated that the appellant met  the  requirements  of  the
    Rules.  In doing that, Judge Osborne took into account bank  statements
    which, it was accepted, had not been submitted  with  the  application.
    Further, he accepted that the sponsor's business was predominantly  one
    in which she was paid in cash and that there was  no  requirement  that
    all of her income would be shown in those statements.

 8. On that basis, Judge  Osborne  accepted  that  the  appellant  met  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules and allowed the  appeal  on  that
    basis.

 9. Further, Judge Osborne  also  considered  whether  the  ECO's  decision
    breached Art 8.  At the date of the hearing,  unlike  at  the  date  of
    decision, the sponsor was pregnant with the appellant's child.  Indeed,
    the birth was imminent, being anticipated about  two  weeks  after  the
    date  of  the  hearing.   Judge  Osborne  considered  that,  in   those
    circumstances, it was proper  for  him  to  have  regard  to  the  best
    interests of "the soon to be born child".  He considered that it was in
    the best interests of the  child  to  have  stability  which  would  be
    achieved if the appellant and sponsor lived together in the UK.   Judge
    Osborne found that, in all the circumstances, the sponsor could not  be
    expected to relocate to Pakistan to  live  with  the  appellant  there.
    Given that she was the "wage earner", if she returned  to  Pakistan  it
    would be "a long time before the sponsor is  able  to  earn  sufficient
    money to satisfy the Immigration Rules as  she  presently  does".   The
    judge took into account the sponsor's health issues, in particular that
    she suffered from severe psoriasis and required weekly injections.   He
    also took into account that the appellant would be  able  to  integrate
    into society in the UK and would not be a burden on the taxpayer.

10. In those circumstances, Judge Osborne concluded that it  would  not  be
    proportionate to refuse the appellant entry  clearance  or  expect  the
    sponsor to live with the appellant in Pakistan.

The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

11. The ECO sought permission to appeal on two grounds.  First,  the  judge
    had been wrong to allow the appeal under  the  Immigration  Rules:  the
    sponsor's personal bank statements for the relevant twelve-month period
    did not show payment in of her claimed "cash" income  to  the  required
    amount of �18,600.  Secondly, the judge had been  wrong  to  allow  the
    appeal under Art 8; he made no finding whether  family  life  could  be
    enjoyed elsewhere, there were no exceptional circumstance, and the best
    interests of the  child  were  to  remain  with  the  sponsor  and  any
    relationship with the appellant could be maintained by visits.

12. On 19 July 2016, the First-tier Tribunal (DJ Woodcraft) granted the ECO
    permission to appeal on the basis that it was arguable that  the  judge
    had been wrong to allow the appeal under the Immigration Rules  in  the
    absence of the specified evidence as required  by  Appendix  FM-SE  and
    that, if that was so, the judge's assessment of Art 8 was also arguably
    flawed as it was based upon his finding  that  the  appellant  met  the
    requirements of the Rules.  The judge, however, refused  permission  on
    the basis that the judge had failed to consider the possibility of  the
    sponsor relocating abroad on the basis that he had done so in  para  34
    of his determination.

13. The appellant filed a rule 24 response seeking to  uphold  the  judge's
    decision both under the Immigration Rules and also Art 8.

14. Thus, the appeal came before me.

The Submissions

15. On behalf of the ECO, Mr Richards submitted that  the  judge  had  been
    wrong to find that the appellant succeeded under the Immigration Rules.
     He accepted that the sponsor's bank statements need not show  all  the
    cash she received by way of income.  However, he  submitted  that  they
    must at least show  the  amount  required  under  Appendix  FM,  namely
    �18,600 in order to meet the evidential requirements.  Since  the  bank
    statements only showed a total income paid in of  �5,334,  Mr  Richards
    submitted that the appellant could not succeed under the Rules and  the
    judge's decision was wrong and should be reversed.

16. In respect of Art 8, Mr Richards submitted that the judge  had  allowed
    the appeal on the basis of the particular circumstances of the sponsor,
    namely that she was pregnant.  However, he submitted that  the  sponsor
    was not pregnant at the date of the ECO's decision on 7 May  2015.   He
    submitted that the judge was required to consider the circumstances  as
    they appertained at the date of decision.  It was wrong, therefore, for
    the judge to take into account the post-decision fact that the  sponsor
    was pregnant.

17. Further, he submitted that the judge's finding in respect of Art 8  was
    necessarily infected by  his  conclusion  (wrongly  reached)  that  the
    appellant met the financial requirements of the Rules.

18. Ms Harrington, who represented  the  appellant,  raised  an  issue  not
    previously addressed in the appeal proceedings.  She submitted that the
    present appeal was governed by the appeal provisions in  force  from  6
    April 2015 as a result of  the  coming  into  effect  of  s.15  of  the
    Immigration Act 2014.  The basis for this submission was found  in  the
    Immigration Act 2014 (Commencement  No.  3,  Transitional  and  Savings
    Provisions) Order 2014 (SI 2014/2771) as amended by the Immigration Act
    2014 (Commencement No.  4,  Transitional  and  Savings  Provisions  and
    Amendment) Order 2015 (SI 2015/371).  She submitted that Art 9  of  the
    Commencement No. 3 Order (as substituted by Art 8 of  the  Commencement
    No. 4 Order) set out that the "saved provisions" (in  other  words  the
    pre-Immigration Act 2014 appeal provisions) applied  where  a  decision
    was made on or after 6 April 2015 to refuse an  application  for  entry
    clearance made before 6 April 2015 but not if: "That decision is also a
    refusal of an asylum, protection or human rights claim."

19. Ms Harrington submitted that the appellant's application had been  made
    before 6 April 2015 and had been decided after 6  April  2015  but  the
    decision also included a  refusal  of  the  appellant's  "human  rights
    claim".  She submitted that an application for  entry  clearance  under
    Appendix FM as a spouse was a "human rights claim".  She relied on  the
    Home Office's own guidance on "Rights of Appeal" where at para 13 it is
    stated that an application under "Appendix FM (family  members)"  is  a
    human rights application and that there is a right of appeal against  a
    refusal under s.82 of the NIA Act 2002 as amended  by  the  Immigration
    Act 2014.

20. As a consequence, the appellant only had a right of  appeal  under  the
    amended s.82(1)(b) against the refusal of that human  rights  claim  in
    the decision of 7 May 2015 limited to human rights grounds, namely  Art
    8.  She accepted that he had no right of appeal on the ground that  the
    Immigration Rules were met but, as the new provision in s.85(4) applied
    to the appeal, the judge was right under Art 8 to consider  any  matter
    "relevant to the substance of the  decision,  including  ...  a  matter
    arising after the date of decision" which, for these purposes, included
    the fact of the sponsor's pregnancy.

21. As a result, Ms Harrington submitted that the  judge  was  entitled  to
    look at the interests of the child following from  the  fact  that  the
    sponsor was pregnant and imminently due to give birth.   She  submitted
    that the judge was entitled to look at  the  sponsor's  finances  as  a
    whole even if the evidential requirements in Appendix  FM-SE  were  not
    met.  However, she submitted that the judge had been right to  conclude
    that  the  financial  requirements  were  met  even  though  the   bank
    statements did not disclose the required amount of at least �18,600 had
    been paid in by the sponsor as  her  income.   It  was  sufficient,  Ms
    Harrington submitted, to look at all the evidence including  the  other
    documents which showed that the sponsor did, in fact, earn in excess of
    that amount.

22. Ms Harrington submitted that, in  any  event,  Judge  Osborne  had  not
    approached Art 8 on the basis that  the  appellant  met  the  financial
    requirement.  Although the judge had referred to that  at  para  27  as
    demonstrating that the decision was "not in accordance with  the  law",
    the  judge  had  in  substance  gone  on  to  consider  the  issue   of
    proportionality at paras 28-37 on the basis that the public interest in
    effective immigration control was  engaged.   She  submitted  that  the
    judge had dealt with the issue of whether the sponsor  should  relocate
    to Pakistan at paras 33-35 and his decision in respect of Art 8  should
    stand.

23. In response to Ms Harrington's submissions in respect  of  whether  the
    appeal was governed by the new appeal provisions, Mr Richards  made  no
    further submissions in respect of whether  the  appellant  had  made  a
    "human rights claim" such that the new provisions applied by virtue  of
    Art 9 of the Commencement No. 3 Order in the light of the Home Office's
    own guidance on "Rights of Appeal" at para  13  which  states  that  an
    application under "Appendix FM (family  members)"  is  a  human  rights
    application and that there is a right of appeal against  a  refusal  of
    that application under s.82 of the NIA  Act  2002  as  amended  by  the
    Immigration Act 2014.

Discussion

24. I deal first with the issue of whether this appeal is governed  by  the
    new appeal provisions in s.82 following amendment  by  the  Immigration
    Act 2014.

25. On this point, I accept Ms Harrington's submissions which were not, in
    substance, challenged by Mr Richards ultimately.  Article 9 of the
    Commencement No. 3 Order (as amended by the Commencement No. 4 Order)
    provides as follows:

         "9 (1)   Notwithstanding the commencement of the relevant
             provisions, the saved provisions continue to have effect and
             the relevant provisions do not have effect so far as they
             relate to the following decisions of the Secretary of State -

                  ...

                  (c)  a decision made on or after 6th April 2015 (so far as
                  that is not a decision mentioned in sub-paragraph (a) or
                  (b)) to refuse an application made before 6th April 2015,
                  where that decision is - ...

                      (ii)     to refuse entry clearance;

                      ...

                  unless that decision is also a refusal of an asylum,
                  protection or human rights claim."

26. The "relevant provisions"  include  the  amended  Part  5.   They  were
    commenced, for these purposes, on 6 April 2015.  The "saved provisions"
    refers to Part 5 as it was immediately before 6 April 2015 before  s.15
    of the Immigration Act 2014 came fully into force.

27. The effect of Art 9(1)(c)(ii) is as follows.  Where an application  for
    entry clearance was made before 6 April 2015 but a decision  to  refuse
    entry clearance was made on or after 6 April 2015  the  pre-Immigration
    Act 2014 appeal provision apply unless the  decision  to  refuse  entry
    clearance included, for example, a refusal of a human rights claim.

28. In the latter instance, the decision to refuse entry clearance after  6
    April 2015 is governed by the new appeal provisions in  effect  from  6
    April 2015.

29. The basis for this transitional provision is plain.  The earlier rights
    of appeal against a refusal of entry clearance made after 6 April  2015
    on a pre-6 April 2015 application are retained because, without more, a
    decision made after 6 April 2015 simply to refuse entry clearance under
    the Immigration Rules would not be  appealable  under  the  new  appeal
    provisions.  However, that is unnecessary where the post-6  April  2015
    decision includes, for example, a  refusal  of  a  human  rights  claim
    because, if it does, there is in any event a right of appeal under  the
    new provisions, albeit against the refusal of that human rights  claim.



30. In this appeal, the appellant's application  for  entry  clearance  was
    made before 6 April 2015  and  it  was  refused  after  6  April  2015.
    However, that refusal included a  refusal  of  the  appellant's  "human
    rights claim".  The Secretary of State's guidance on rights  of  appeal
    at page 13 "deems" an application by a family member under Appendix  FM
    for entry clearance (such as  the  appellant's  application  for  entry
    clearance as a spouse) to be a  human  rights  application  and,  as  a
    consequence, its refusal is a refusal of a "human rights claim" falling
    within the proviso in Art 9(1)(c) of the Commencement No. 3  Order  (as
    amended).  It is of course, the case that the ECO  and  ECM  considered
    the appellant's application for entry  clearance  not  only  under  the
    Rules but also under Art 8.

31. It is clear to me, therefore, that  the  appellant's  right  of  appeal
    against the refusal of entry clearance on 7  May  2015  was  an  appeal
    under the new appeal provisions in Part 5 introduced by the Immigration
    Act 2014.  The appellant's right  of  appeal  was,  as  a  consequence,
    limited to human rights grounds, in this context limited to Art 8  (see
    s.82(1)(b) and s.84(2)).

32. For that  reason  alone,  the  judge  erred  in  law  in  allowing  the
    appellant's appeal under the Immigration Rules.  The appellant  had  no
    appeal on the ground that the decision breached the Immigration  Rules.
    The relevance of the Immigration Rules was, of course,  as  to  whether
    the appellant could establish a breach of Art 8.

33. Likewise, as a consequence of the new  Part  5  of  the  NIA  Act  2002
    applying to this appeal, I accept Ms Harrington's submission  that  the
    appeal was governed by s.85(4) as amended by s.15  of  the  Immigration
    Act 2014 and not by the repealed s.85A(2).  As a consequence, the judge
    was not restricted to considering the  "circumstances  appertaining  at
    the time of the decision" but could  consider  "the  substance  of  the
    decision, including ... a matter arising after the date  of  decision."
    I will return to the implications of this below when considering Art 8.



34. As I have already indicated, the judge was wrong in law  to  allow  the
    appeal under the Immigration Rules which was not  a  ground  of  appeal
    under the new appeal provisions in Part 5.  However, in any  event,  in
    my judgment he was also wrong to conclude that the  appellant  met  the
    requirements of the Rules.

35. First, the judge took into account documents which were  not  submitted
    with the application.  The Immigration Rules are quite  clear  that  an
    individual may only rely upon documents which are  submitted  with  the
    application (see Appendix FM-SE, para D(a)).  I was  not  addressed  to
    the  contrary  on  this  specific  issue  in  the  appeal   by   either
    representative.

36. Secondly, in any event, the documents before the judge did not  satisfy
    the evidential requirements  in  Appendix  FM-SE.   The  appellant  was
    relying  upon  the  self-employed  income  of  the  sponsor   and,   in
    particular, cash payments she received.  As a consequence, in para 7 of
    Appendix FM-SE the appellant had to produce, as "specified  documents",
    a number of documents including in para 7(f):

         "Personal bank statements for the same 12-month period as  the  tax
         return(s) showing that the income  from  self-employment  has  been
         made into an account in the name of the person or in  the  name  of
         the person and their partner jointly."

37. The personal bank statements of the sponsor, submitted for the relevant
    12-month period, only  showed  payments  in  reflecting  the  sponsor's
    income of �5,334 which was well short of the required amount of �18,600
    which the appellant had to show as gross income available to  meet  the
    financial requirements of the Rules.

38. I do not accept Ms Harrington's submission that  bank  statements  need
    only show some of the cash earned by the sponsor providing  that  other
    evidence, including other specified documents, show that she earned  in
    excess of the required amount.  To do so  would,  in  my  judgment,  be
    inconsistent with the clear purpose underlying para 7 of Appendix FM-SE
    which  is  to  require  by  specified  documents  that  the  individual
    establish he meets the requirements of the Rules, here that the sponsor
    earns at least �18,600.

39. Mr Richards did not submit that all the sponsor's income in  cash  must
    be shown as paid into the bank account.   However,  he  submitted  that
    what was paid in must at least demonstrate  that  she  had  earned  the
    required level of income under the  Rules.   I  agree.   Anything  less
    would, in my judgment, result in such bank statements  being  pointless
    evidential documents.  The whole purpose  of  requiring  the  specified
    documents in, for  example,  para  7  of  Appendix  FM-SE  is  that  an
    individual establishes by reliable documentation  that  they  meet  the
    financial requirements of the Rules.   If  Ms  Harrington's  submission
    were correct, the bank statements would fail to  achieve  this  aim  or
    purpose.

40. I do not accept Ms Harrington's submission that the shortcoming in  the
    bank statements can be overcome by other evidence, whether oral or,  as
    Ms Harrington also submitted, other specified  documents.   It  is  the
    specified documents which  are  required  to  establish  the  financial
    requirement.  Oral  evidence  cannot  assist.   Further,  it  would  be
    illogical  to  allow  other  specified  documents   to   overcome   the
    shortcoming in the bank statement otherwise,  an  individual  would  be
    entitled to succeed in effect by producing only some  of  the  required
    specified documents having the necessary evidential content.

41. It follows that Judge Osborne was wrong to find that the appellant  met
    the requirements  of  Appendix  FM  as  a  spouse,  in  particular  the
    financial requirement in E-ECP.3.1.

42. What then of the judge's decision to allow the appellant's appeal under
    Art 8?

43. Mr Richards submitted that the judge's error  in  concluding  that  the
    appellant met the requirements of the Immigration Rules had tainted the
    judge's decision under Art 8.  Whilst I accept that  at  para  27,  the
    judge did consider that the decision was "not in  accordance  with  the
    law" because the appellant succeeded under the  Immigration  Rules,  he
    nevertheless went on to consider the  issue  of  proportionality.   The
    judge's reasoning is at paras  28-37.   If  the  judge  had  approached
    proportionality on the basis that the appellant met the requirements of
    the Immigration Rules, then the issue of  proportionality  would,  most
    likely, have required little exploration on the basis that there  would
    be little or no public interest based upon the maintenance of effective
    immigration  control.   Clearly  on  reading   the   judge's   detailed
    consideration of the circumstances of the appellant and sponsor and his
    specific recognition and consideration of s.117B(1) at para 36  of  his
    determination that the "maintenance of effective  immigration  controls
    is in the public interest", there is no doubt that the judge approached
    Art 8 - and the issue of proportionality -  on  the  premise  that  the
    appellant had not met the requirements  of  the  Rules  (see  also  his
    specific reference to the public  interest  at  para  33).   For  those
    reasons, I reject Mr Richards's submission that the  judge's  error  in
    finding that the  appellant  met  the  Immigration  Rules  tainted  his
    decision in respect of Art 8.

44. In his oral submissions, Mr Richards other principal point was that the
    judge erred in considering the sponsor's circumstances,  in  particular
    her pregnancy as that post-dated the ECO's decision on 7 May 2015.

45. In my judgment, that submission is untenable once it is understood that
    the appellant's appeal was governed by the new Part  5  provisions,  in
    particular s.85(4) of the NIA Act 2002  (as  amended  by  s.15  of  the
    Immigration Act 2014).  Whilst it is correct that  under  the  previous
    appeal regime in Part 5 prior to 6 April 2015, in  an  entry  clearance
    case  a  judge  was  required  only  to  consider   the   circumstances
    "appertaining at the date of decision".  However,  that  provision  has
    been repealed and in an appeal dealing with a refusal of a human rights
    claim (such as this) the new s.85(4) allows a judge  to  consider  "any
    matter which [he] thinks relevant to the  substance  of  the  decision,
    including ... a matter arising after the date of decision."

46. As a result, Judge Osborne was entitled to take  the  circumstances  as
    they were at the date of hearing, namely that the sponsor was  pregnant
    and  was  imminently  due  to  give  birth.   I  reject  Mr  Richards's
    submission that the judge was wrong to consider the appellant's  appeal
    on the basis that the sponsor was pregnant.  I should  point  out  that
    that issue was not raised in the ECO's grounds of appeal.

47. Further, neither in the grounds of appeal nor, indeed, in  Mr  Richards
    submissions was it suggested that, if the judge was entitled to look at
    the facts as at the date of the  hearing,  it  was  wrong  for  him  to
    consider the best interests of the child which  was,  as  yet,  unborn.
    The grounds of appeal argue that the judge's finding in that regard  is
    wrong but not that he was disentitled from considering the child's best
    interests.

48. It is clear from the wording of s.55 of the  Borders,  Citizenship  and
    Immigration Act 2009 that the Secretary of State's duty to have  regard
    to the welfare of children only applies to children  "who  are  in  the
    United Kingdom". That would not, therefore,  include  an  unborn  child
    who, under English law, has no legal personality or legal rights.

49. Judge Osborne, however, took the pragmatic approach that as  the  birth
    of the child was "so imminent ... it would be wrong  ...  not  to  take
    into consideration the best interests of the soon to  be  born  child".
    And, of course, he went on to find that the best interests of the child
    were to be brought up in a "loving and caring  home  by  both  parents"
    which he found could not reasonably be expected to occur in Pakistan.

50. There is  no  doubt  that  the  judge  was  required  to  look  at  the
    circumstances appertaining at the date of the hearing.  At the date  of
    the hearing, the sponsor was pregnant and her child was due to be  born
    in two weeks.  Whilst the  judge  could  not,  strictly,  consider  the
    rights of the child, as yet unborn, because in English law  it  had  no
    legal rights, it was  relevant  to  consider  the  readily  foreseeable
    effect upon the appellant and sponsor of  the  birth  of  their  child.
    That necessarily entailed a consideration, albeit with some  foresight,
    the best interests  of  that  child  because  that  impacted  upon  the
    proportionality of the decision to refuse the appellant entry clearance
    and, specifically, the issue of whether the sponsor (as the prospective
    parent of the child) could be expected to relocate to Pakistan and  the
    impact upon the appellant if separated  from  the  sponsor  who  would,
    within a brief space of time, be the mother of his child.

51. For those reasons, I do not  consider  that  the  judge,  in  the  very
    specific circumstances of this appeal, erred in law by considering  the
    best interests of the child who would be imminently born.

52. Although raised in the grounds, Mr Richards did not seek to argue  that
    the judge's assessment of the child's best interests was  flawed.   The
    judge found that it was in the child's best interests to be brought  up
    "in a loving and caring home by both parents".  In  his  determination,
    the judge concluded at paras 33-35, that that could only be achieved in
    the UK as the sponsor could not be expected to  relocate  to  Pakistan.
    Mr Richards did not seek to challenge the judge's reasoning which is as
    follows:

         "33. In the cases of MK (best interests of the child: India) [2011]
             UKUT 475 and EV (Philippines)  [2014]  EWCA  Civ  874  it  was
             confirmed that a two-stage assessment is  appropriate.   First
             it should be considered whether it is in the best interests of
             the child to remain in the UK.  On the basis that  immediately
             after the birth it is likely that  the  Sponsor  (the  mother)
             will need the assistance of close members  of  her  family,  I
             find that for  the  foreseeable  future  it  is  in  the  best
             interests of the yet to be born child to remain in the  United
             Kingdom whilst being cared for by the British mother who  will
             have recently given birth.

             Second, I should consider whether the best  interests  of  the
             child  are  outweighed  by  the  importance   of   maintaining
             immigration control.

         34.  In this particular appeal I  find  that  the  Sponsor  in  her
             present condition  should  not  be  expected  to  relocate  to
             Pakistan to live with her husband there.  If she does then the
             period in Pakistan before any permanent return to the UK  will
             be possible, will be somewhat indefinite.  At present, in this
             application/appeal the Sponsor is the  wage  earner.   If  she
             proceeds to Pakistan, it would  be  potentially  a  long  time
             before the Sponsor  is  able  to  earn  sufficient  income  to
             satisfy the Immigration Rules as she presently does.

         35.  I find that it is generally in the best interests of  children
             to have stability.  I find that  there  is  more  prospect  of
             stability for the child in the UK at present than there is  in
             Pakistan.  The Sponsor's  family  live  in  the  UK  in  close
             proximity to the Sponsor.  They will be able  to  assist  her.
             She is far more familiar  with  them  than  she  is  with  her
             husband's family.   Additionally,  the  Sponsor  suffers  from
             severe psoriasis for which she needs two injections each week.
              When she has been to  Pakistan  she  has  taken  supplies  of
             medication with her but this necessarily involves a change  to
             her usual regime and she would be far  more  comfortable  with
             the medication in the UK.  Yet further, if the Sponsor were to
             reside in Pakistan indefinitely, her oral  evidence  (which  I
             have  no  reason  to  disbelieve)  is   that   the   drug   is
             prohibitively expensive in Pakistan.   She  stated  that  each
             injection would cost in the region  of  �1,000.   That  indeed
             would be prohibitively expensive, particularly if the  Sponsor
             were to remain in Pakistan indefinitely."

53. As those paragraphs make plain, the judge did consider and give reasons
    why the sponsor could not be expected  to  relocate  to  Pakistan.   He
    considered that both in terms of long-term relocation and also  whether
    she could be expected to do so pending any future  application  by  the
    appellant  for  entry  clearance.   Having  regard  to   her   personal
    circumstances and the position of the child, I am  unable  to  conclude
    that the judge's finding was perverse or irrational.

54. It is also plain that in para 33 and then following  in  para  36,  the
    judge considered the circumstances of the  appellant  and  sponsor  and
    balanced  against  that  the  importance  of  maintaining   immigration
    control.  Clearly, here, the  judge  did  so  on  the  basis  that  the
    appellant could not establish he met the  requirements  of  the  Rules.
    The judge sets out s.117B and, in particular sub-sections (1) and  (2).
    Whilst he refers to the appellant and sponsor as being  able  to  speak
    English and not being a burden on  the  taxpayer,  matters  which  were
    neutral in assessing the public interest (see Rhuppiah  v  SSHD  [2016]
    EWCA Civ 803), the bulk  of  his  reasoning  relates  to  the  personal
    circumstances and the weight that he gave to them  in  outweighing  the
    public interest that he recognises in  effective  immigration  control.
    Having taken all these matters into account, I am  not  satisfied  that
    the judge's finding that the decision was disproportionate was one  not
    properly open to him.  It may be that not every judge would necessarily
    have reached the conclusion that he did.   That  however  does  not  in
    itself establish that the judge erred  in  law.   In  Mukarkar  v  SSHD
    [2006] EWCA Civ 1054 Carnwath LJ said this at [40]:

         "The mere fact that one Tribunal  has  reached  what  may  seem  an
         unusually generous view of the facts of a particular case does  not
         mean that it has made an error of law ..."

55. In my  judgment,  Judge  Osborne's  finding  that  the  ECO's  decision
    breached Art 8 was one properly open to him for the  reasons  he  gave.
    That decision was not perverse or irrational.

Decision

56. For the above reasons, the First-tier Tribunal erred in law in allowing
    the appellant's appeal under the Immigration Rules.  That  decision  is
    set aside.

57. The appellant's appeal  was  only  properly  brought  on  human  rights
    grounds, in particular under Art 8.

58. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal to allow the appellant's appeal
    under Art 8 did not involve the making of a material error of law.  The
    decision to allow the appeal under Art 8 stands.

FEE AWARD

Judge Osborne made a full fee award of �140.  I see  no  basis  to  reach  a
