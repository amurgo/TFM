Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr S Winter, Advocate, instructed by Katani & Co,
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mrs M O'Brien, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Iraq, born on 3 February 1996.

 2. This decision is to be read with:

      i) The respondent's  decision  dated  31  August  2017,  refusing  the
         appellant's protection claim.

     ii) The appellant's grounds of appeal to the FtT, filed on 14 September
         2017 ("Convention reason, imputed political opinion; articles 2,  3
         & 8 of ECHR engaged").

    iii) The decision of FtT Judge Doyle, promulgated on  18  January  2017,
         dismissing the appellant's appeal.

     iv) The appellant's grounds of  appeal  to  the  UT,  attached  to  the
         application dated 1 February 2018.

      v) The grant of permission by FtT Judge  Brunnen,  dated  13  February
         2018.

 3. Having heard submissions, I indicated that the appeal to the UT did not
    succeed.

 4. At highest, the grounds show an error of fact, in that the  judge  took
    the appellant to be only a "contributor" rather than an "administrator"
    of the page entitled "Padsha" on Facebook.

 5. Mrs O'Brien contended that there was no error  even  of  fact,  as  the
    appellant had not shown any difference between a contributor to and  an
    administrator of a Facebook page, and this was  only  a  choice  of  an
    equivalent term by the judge.

 6. I take the view that there was slight slip on the  facts,  although  it
    was a matter well buried amongst the evidence of Facebook postings, and
    not a point of which much, if anything,  was  made  in  the  FtT.   The
    terminology, and common knowledge, suggests that an administrator of  a
    Facebook page or  account  has  control  over  it  in  a  way  which  a
    contributor of posts does not.

 7. This does not undermine the finding at ï¿½12 (j), "The  reality  is  that
    the screenshots and translations  contribute  nothing  to  the  central
    elements of the appellant's claim".

 8. That sub-paragraph also records, accurately, that the appellant did not
    claim to be in fear or at risk as a result of anonymous threats  posted
    on Facebook.

 9. The error does not impact on  the  reasoning  of  the  FtT.   It  takes
    nothing away from the rejection of the appellant's account that he  was
    instrumental in organising demonstrations in 2015.  (As  was  accepted,
    it has nothing to do  with  his  claim  based  on  an  online  romantic
    relationship, the findings on which are not challenged in the grounds.)

10. Despite Mr Winter's best efforts to find a  line  of  argument  to  the
    contrary, the slip by the judge was  on  a  minor  and  obscure  point,
    immaterial to the outcome.

11.  The decision of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.

12. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
