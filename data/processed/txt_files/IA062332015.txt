                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction

   1. The appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh who was born  on  7  February
      1991.  He entered the United Kingdom on 30 March 2012 with leave as  a
      student valid  until  30  April  2013.   His  leave  was  subsequently
      curtailed because  his  sponsor's  licence  was  revoked.   A  further
      application made out of time application for leave as  a  student  was
      refused.  On 14 April 2014, the appellant applied for a residence card
      as an extended family member of  an  EEA  national  exercising  treaty
      rights in the UK under reg 17(4) of the Immigration (EEA)  Regulations
      2006  (SI  2006/1003  as  amended)  (the  "2006  Regulations").   That
      application was rejected on 6 October 2014.

   2. On 20 October 2014, the appellant again  made  an  application  for  a
      residence card on  the  basis  of  his  relationship  with  a  Latvian
      national, Julija Potasa with whom he had undergone an Islamic marriage
      on 24 June 2014.

   3. On 29 January 2015, the Secretary of  State  refused  the  appellant's
      application.  The application was dealt with as an application  by  an
      "extended family member" as the appellant's religious marriage was not
      recognised in English law.  The  Secretary  of  State  approached  the
      application on the basis that the appellant was claiming to  be  in  a
      "durable  relationship"  falling  within  reg   8(5)   of   the   2006
      Regulations.

   4. The Secretary of State refused  the  appellant's  application  on  two
      bases.  First, the Secretary of  State  was  not  satisfied  that  the
      appellant and his partner were in a "durable relationship".  Secondly,
      the Secretary of State was  not  satisfied  that  the  sponsor  was  a
      "qualified person" on the basis that she was working as claimed.

The Appeal to the First-tier Tribunal

   5. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.  In a determination
      promulgated  on  28  August  2015,  Judge  Trevaskis   dismissed   the
      appellant's appeal.  He accepted, on the evidence before him, that the
      appellant and sponsor were in a "durable relationship".   However,  he
      was not satisfied that the sponsor was a  "qualified  person"  as  the
      appellant had failed to establish that she was a worker.

The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

   6. The appellant sought permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal on the
      basis that the judge had erred in law in finding that the sponsor  was
      not a qualified person.  Permission was initially refused by the First-
      tier Tribunal but on 23 February 2016 the Upper  Tribunal  (UTJ  Blum)
      granted the appellant permission to appeal.

   7. Permission was granted on the basis that the judge had arguably  erred
      in law in taking the relevant date, to determine whether  the  sponsor
      was a worker, as being the date of application rather than the date of
      the hearing.  Further, the judge had arguably erred in law in  finding
      that the evidence did not establish that the sponsor  was  working  as
      claimed immediately prior to her taking maternity  leave  on  14  June
      2015 when their son was born.

   8. On 9 March 2016, the respondent filed a  rule  24  notice  seeking  to
      uphold the judge's decision.

   9. Thus, the appeal came before me.

Discussion

      1. Error of Law

  10. The appellant's claim before  the  judge  was  that  the  sponsor  was
      working in a clothing factory (Right Serve Limited) at the date of the
      application, namely 20 October 2014.  She had started working there in
      June 2014.  She had made trip to Latvia between 7 and 16 October  2014
      but had returned to the UK and continued working.  She stopped working
      in November 2014 when they moved to Swindon but found another job.  In
      December 2014  the  sponsor  started  working  for  Tennessee  Chicken
      Limited.  She had continued to work for that employer until she  began
      maternity leave on 14 June 2015 when their son was born.  At the  date
      of the hearing on 13 August 2015, the appellant's case  was  that  the
      sponsor was on maternity leave and that she intended to return to work
      after that leave.

  11. Having accepted that the appellant  and  sponsor  were  in  a  durable
      relationship, Judge Trevaskis dealt with the evidence  concerning  the
      sponsor's employment at  paras  43-45  and,  at  46  having  done  so,
      concluded that the appellant had not established  that  she  had  been
      working  for  Tennessee  Chicken  Limited  immediately  before  taking
      maternity leave.  The judge's reasons are as follows:

         "43.     I have considered the question of whether the sponsor is a
             qualifying person, on the basis that she  is  an  EEA  citizen
             exercising treaty rights in the United Kingdom  as  a  worker.
             The material date for the purpose of  the  application  for  a
             residence card was the date of application, 20  October  2014.
             At that time, the sponsor stated  that  she  was  working  for
             Right Serve Limited in a clothing factory,  but  had  been  to
             Latvia from 7 - 16 October 2014.  The only  evidence  of  that
             employment was a  payslip  recording  171  hours  work  during
             August 2014.  There is no evidence of income  from  employment
             after that date, and before the date of application.  There is
             no evidence of the deposit of that  claimed  income  into  the
             sponsor's bank account.  The payslip makes  no  deduction  for
             income tax.  The next evidence of income  from  employment  is
             provided by payslips from Tennessee chicken limited  beginning
             with the week ending 19 December 2014.  Those payslips are for
             a net weekly wage of �52, and  no  national  insurance  number
             appears.  When questioned about these  payslips,  the  sponsor
             was unable to  explain  why  there  were  irregularities,  and
             simply said that she did not understand such matters.

         44.      The burden of proof of employment is upon  the  appellant,
             and I am not satisfied that that burden has been discharged to
             the required standard, either by the documents relied upon, or
             by the oral testimony of the appellant or the sponsor.   There
             is no reason why the appellant could not produce a contract of
             the sponsor's employment, or even a letter from her  employer,
             to prove that she was working.

         45.      The question of whether or not the sponsor qualifies as  a
             worker whilst unable to work because of  pregnancy  is  not  a
             matter which is relevant to this  appeal;  because  I  am  not
             satisfied that she has shown that she  was  a  worker  at  the
             material time, her subsequent circumstances do not  figure  in
             this decision.  She has  not  produced  any  evidence  of  her
             claimed medical advice not to return to work, and she has  not
             evinced any actual or intended return to work.

         46.      For these reasons, while I am satisfied that the Appellant
             and the Sponsor are  in  a  durable  relationship,  I  am  not
             satisfied that the sponsor is  a  qualifying  person  for  the
             purposes of the EEA regulations."

  12. Mr Hussain, on behalf of the appellant, submitted that the  judge  had
      erred in law in para 43 in taking  as  the  "material  date"  for  the
      purposes of determining whether the sponsor was a  "qualified  person"
      as that of the date  of  application,  namely  20  October  2014.   He
      submitted that the correct date was the date of the hearing.

  13. As regards the evidence concerning the sponsor's employment  prior  to
      taking maternity leave on 14 June 2015, Mr Hussain submitted that  the
      judge had been wrong to take into account the absence of payslips  for
      the claimed period of employment in 2005  as  the  sponsor  had  given
      evidence that these had been submitted to the DWP in  order  to  claim
      maternity pay.  Mr Hussain submitted that the judge had failed to take
      into account  an  email  dated  15  July  2015  from  the  responsible
      accounting firm for Tennessee Chicken Limited which pointed  out  that
      the sponsor was not entitled  to  statutory  maternity  pay  from  her
      employer but that she should make a claim,  including  "the  last  few
      payslips as evidence of her working".  Mr Hussain submitted  that  the
      judge had, therefore, failed to take into account relevant documentary
      and oral evidence supporting the appellant's claim  that  the  sponsor
      was employed by Tennessee Chicken Limited as claimed prior  to  taking
      maternity leave on 14  June  2015  and  that,  therefore,  she  was  a
      "qualified person" at that point in time and continued to be so whilst
      she was on maternity leave - two months later - at  the  date  of  the
      hearing before Judge Trevaskis.

  14. Mr Richards, on behalf of the Secretary of State,  accepted  that  the
      judge  had  wrongly  taken  the  relevant  date  as   the   "date   of
      application".  Further, he accepted  that  the  judge  had  failed  to
      adequately consider the sponsor's employment position at the  date  of
      hearing.  Mr Richards confirmed from  the  record  of  the  Presenting
      Officer at the hearing that the sponsor had said in her oral evidence,
      in answer to questions put  by  the  judge,  that  she  had  sent  the
      Tennessee Chicken Limited payslips to the DWP.  He accepted  that  the
      judge had not considered the email from  Tennessee  Chicken  Limited's
      accountants; had not considered the evidence of the sponsor - whom  he
      had found to be (like the appellant) credible - that she was  employed
      and that there was an explanation for the  absence  of  payslips;  and
      that the sponsor had stated in her witness statement and oral evidence
      that she intended to return to work after her maternity leave.

  15. In my judgment, the judge did materially err in law  in  reaching  his
      adverse finding in relation to the sponsor's claimed employment.

  16. The Judge did misdirect himself in para 43 that the relevant date  for
      considering the appellant's claim was the date of  application.   That
      was clearly wrong.  The  judge  was,  by  virtue  of  s.85(4)  of  the
      Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (applied to  EEA  appeals
      by Schedule 1 to the 2006 Regulations), required to "consider evidence
      about any matter ...  relevant  to  the  substance  of  the  decision,
      including evidence which concerns a matter arising after the  date  of
      decision" (my emphasis).

  17. That said, in para 43 onward Judge Trevaskis considered  the  evidence
      relevant to the sponsor's employment after the date of application and
      so that error was not material.  However, in doing so, in my judgment,
      he failed to take into account all the evidence that was  before  him.
      He did not consider the explanation by the sponsor (whose evidence  he
      found (at para 39) to be credible and truthful) that  the  absence  of
      the payslips was explicable because she had sent them to  the  DWP  in
      order to make a claim for maternity pay.  He noted that she  had  made
      such an application at para 17.  Further, the email of  15  July  2015
      also provided support for her explanation as to their  absence.   That
      email, of course, also provided support for her  claim  that  she  was
      employed by Tennessee Chicken  Limited  immediately  prior  to  taking
      maternity leave.  For these  reasons,  in  my  judgment,  the  judge's
      adverse finding that the sponsor had not established that  she  was  a
      "qualified person" was legally flawed and cannot stand.

  18. In addition, the judge found that the sponsor had not established that
      she intended to return  to  work  after  her  maternity  leave.   That
      finding in para 45 of his determination was, as the judge pointed out,
      not a live issue  as  he  had  not  accepted  that  she  was  employed
      immediately prior to taking maternity leave and  that,  therefore,  it
      was not strictly speaking relevant whether during her maternity  leave
      she  continued  to  be  a  "worker"  for  the  purposes  of  the  2006
      Regulations.  That finding is, in  my  judgment  also  flawed  because
      there was, as Mr Richards  acknowledged,  evidence  from  the  sponsor
      (whom the judge found to be credible and truthful) that she did intend
      to return to work.

  19. Consequently, for these reasons, the judge's decision to  dismiss  the
      appellant's appeal involved the making of an error of law.  It  cannot
      stand and I set it aside.

      2. Re-making the Decision

  20. On my enquiry,  Mr  Richards  indicated  that  given  the  documentary
      material and the judge's positive credibility findings in  respect  of
      both the appellant and sponsor in para 39 of his determination,  there
      was no reason why I should not find  in  the  appellant's  favour  and
      allow the appeal.

  21. That position is, as regards the issue of whether the  sponsor  was  a
      "qualified person", an entirely proper position to take.

  22. In addition to the  evidence  before  Judge  Trevaskis,  a  bundle  of
      additional material was submitted by the appellant including  payslips
      in the sponsor's name  from  the  Tennessee  Chicken  Limited  between
      January and June 2015 showing net weekly earnings of �52.  In addition
      there is a P60 form in respect of the sponsor  for  the  tax  year  to
      April 2015 and a notice of coding relating to the sponsor  in  respect
      of Tennessee Chicken Limited for the tax year 2015-2016.  No objection
      to their admission was made.  Given the circumstances  concerning  the
      payslips which I have previously  identified  and  that  some  of  the
      documents are very recent, it is appropriate to admit those  documents
      under rule 15(2A) of the Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
      2008 (SI 2008/2698 as amended).

  23. Whilst the absence of a national insurance number on the payslips  may
      be unusual, the judge made a very clear positive  credibility  finding
      in relation to both the appellant  and  sponsor  at  para  39  of  his
      determination.  The sponsor's explanation was that she simply did  not
      have any understanding why her  NI  number  was  omitted.   I  see  no
      reason, given the judge's very positive credibility finding, to  doubt
      her evidence and the authenticity of the payslips.  Her employment  by
      Tennessee Chicken Limited immediately prior to her maternity leave  is
      also supported by the email of 15 July 2015 and the HMRC documents  to
      which I have referred.

  24. I find, therefore, that the appellant has established on a balance  of
      probabilities that at the date of her maternity leave she had been and
      continued to be employed by Tennessee Chicken Limited.  At the date of
      the hearing she was on maternity leave and, again in the light of  the
      judge's very positive credibility finding, I accept her evidence  that
      she intended to return to work after her maternity leave.  At the date
      of the hearing she was, of course, only two months into that leave.

  25.  Consequently,  the  appellant  has  established  on  a   balance   of
      probabilities that at the date of the hearing (and at the date of  the
      respondent's decision on 29 January 2015) that he was  in  a  "durable
      relationship" with the sponsor and that the sponsor  was  a  qualified
      person.

  26. Having established that the applicant is an "extended family  member",
      by virtue of reg 17(4)(b) the Secretary of State had a  discretion  to
      issue the appellant with a residence card.  The  issue  of  discretion
      was considered by the Secretary of State in her  decision  limited  to
      the following sentence:

         "We do not believe that you have provided enough evidence to  allow
         us  to  exercise  discretion  in  your  favour  for  the  following
         reason(s) applicant has previous  attempted  to  acquire  leave  by
         deception, and having been served with removal  papers  on  14-Mar-
         2014."

  27. The issue of discretion was not considered by Judge Trevaskis  and  it
      was not raised in the respondent's rule 24 notice.  It does not appear
      to have been raised in the appellant's grounds or skeleton argument.

  28. The Secretary of State's obligation in exercising that discretion was,
      as set out in reg 17(5) to "undertake an extensive examination of  the
      personal circumstances of the applicant".  The  Secretary  of  State's
      decision not to exercise discretion in the appellant's favour was,  of
      course, based  upon  two  false  factual  premises,  namely  that  the
      appellant was not in a durable relationship with the sponsor  and  the
      sponsor was not a qualified person.  Neither of those factual premises
      was correct.  The only factor referred to by the Secretary of State in
      her decision was said to be the appellant's previous deception.  It is
      unclear to me from the file precisely what the circumstances  of  that
      claimed deception were.

  29. Having considered the matter carefully, I do not consider that I am in
      a position to exercise, one way or another, the discretion  under  reg
      17(4)(b) of  the  2006  Regulations.   The  respondent's  exercise  of
      discretion is clearly flawed due to the false premise and that  merely
      to take into account (even if established)  the  appellant's  previous
      deception cannot be said  to  be  "an  extensive  examination  of  the
      personal circumstances" of  the  appellant.   There  are  now  clearly
      relevant circumstances that were not considered by  the  Secretary  of
      State because they post-date her decision, in particular the birth  of
      the appellant and sponsor's son on 14 June 2015.  In my judgment,  the
      proper disposal of this appeal is to allow the appeal  such  that  the
      appellant's application for a residence card remains outstanding to be
      decided by the Secretary of State on a lawful basis, namely  that  the
      appellant has established that he is an "extended family  member"  and
      that discretion has yet to be lawfully exercised having regard to  all
      the circumstances of the appellant.

Decision

  30. For the above reasons, the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to
      dismiss the appellant's appeal under the 2006 Regulations involved the
      making of an error of law.  That decision  cannot  stand  and  is  set
      aside.

  31. I remake the decision allowing the appellant's appeal  to  the  extent
      that the decision of the Secretary of State was not in accordance with
      the law and  that  the  appellant's  application  remains  outstanding
      before the Secretary of State to make a  lawful  decision  whether  to
      exercise discretion in the appellant's favour on the basis that he has
      established that he is an "extended  family  member"  and,  therefore,
      meets the requirement in reg 17(4)(a).
