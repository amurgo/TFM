Representation:
For the appellant:     Ms A Jaja, instructed by Howe & Co Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr C Avery, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Dharmindra Rana, date of birth 1.3.88, is a  citizen  of
    Nepal.

 2. This is his appeal against the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Hussain, who dismissed his appeal against  the  decision  of  the
    respondent, dated 18.6.13, to refuse him entry clearance to the  United
    Kingdom as the dependant son of Mr Gajbir Rana.  The  Judge  heard  the
    appeal on 20.5.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Pooler  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    29.8.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 10.10.14 as an appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

 5. I found such errors of law in the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    that I set it aside and adjourned the remaking of  the  decision  to  a
    continuation hearing before me in the Upper Tribunal.

 6.  Thus  the  matter   came   back   before   me   on   13.11.14   as   a
    continuation/resumed hearing in the Upper Tribunal. The sole issue,  as
    it was before the First-tier Tribunal is family life  under  article  8
    ECHR. I have to determine whether there was  family  life  between  the
    appellant and the rest of  his  family  at  the  date  of  refusal  and
    whether, applying the Razgar five step approach the decision to  refuse
    was proportionate. The burden is on the appellant to  demonstrate  that
    the interference with family life occasioned by the refusal decision is
    sufficiently grave as to engage article 8. If so, the burden is on  the
    respondent to demonstrate that the decision was proportionate.

 7. The crucial issue in  relation  to  proportionality  is  the  balancing
    exercise between on the one hand the rights to respect for family  life
    of the appellant and his  family  in  the  UK  and  on  the  other  the
    legitimate and necessary aim of the state to protect the economic well-
    being of the UK though  immigration  control.  It  is  clear  that  the
    appellant cannot meet any of the Immigration Rules for entry to the UK.
    In the circumstances of their being no  complete  code  for  article  8
    considerations within the relevant Immigration  Rules,  I  consider  it
    appropriate to make an article 8 assessment, whether or not  there  are
    any  compelling  circumstances   insufficiently   recognised   in   the
    Immigration Rules so as to justify, exceptionally, allowing the  appeal
    under article  8  family  life  on  the  basis  that  the  decision  is
    unjustifiably harsh.

 8. Although the case law continues to develop,  the  current  position  is
    perhaps best expressed in paragraph 135  of   R(MM  (Lebanon))  v  SSHD
    [2014] EWCA Civ 985:


         "135.  Where the relevant group of IRs  [immigration  rules],  upon
         their proper construction provide a  "complete  code"  for  dealing
         with a person's Convention rights in the context of a particular IR
         or statutory provision, such as in the case of "foreign criminals",
         then the balancing exercise and the way the various factors are  to
         be taken into account  in  an  individual  case  must  be  done  in
         accordance with  that  code,  although  reference  to  "exceptional
         circumstances"   in   the   code   will   nonetheless   entail    a
         proportionality exercise.  But if the relevant group of IRs is  not
         such a "complete code" then the proportionality test will  be  more
         at large, albeit guided by the Huang tests and  UK  and  Strasbourg
         case law."

 9. I should also recall that the threshold to engage article 8(1)  is  not
    particularly high (see VW (Uganda) v SSHD [2009] EWCA Civ 5).


10. In conducting any proportionality balancing exercise under article 8  I
    have to have regard to the effect  of  the  historic  injustice,  which
    interest, if it can be shown that but for the historical injustice  the
    ex-Ghurkha would have settled in the UK at a time when the child  could
    have joined him, has been held to be likely to outweigh the public.

11. The evidence of the appellant's father at ï¿½14 of his witness  statement
    was that he would have settled in the UK on discharge  from  the  army,
    could he have done so at that time. The appellant was born in  1988,  4
    years after his father's discharge and thus would have been born in the
    UK, had his father been permitted  to  settle  on  discharge.  In  oral
    evidence before me he explained that  the  appellant  had  never  lived
    apart from the family before they left Nepal.  The  questioning  of  Mr
    Rana  investigated  the  two   different   addresses   given   in   the
    documentation. However, I accept that the family had a village home  in
    Tribini, but moved to Pokhara in 2008, where they  rented  a  home,  to
    enable the children to be educated locally.  He  explained  that  their
    permanent address was in  their  remote  village  but  their  temporary
    address was in Pokhara. When the family came to the  UK  in  2010  they
    left the appellant behind in the same address and where he  has  shared
    the cost of living with a number  of  fellow  students.  Mr  Rana  also
    explained that when they came to the UK they did not have enough  money
    for the appellant to come, so decided to come to the UK  and  earn  the
    money necessary whilst enabling him to continue his education in Nepal.
    As he was then already over 18, he  was  advised  that  an  application
    would be refused and he would thus lose  the  fees  paid.  I  find  the
    explanation reasonable and  credible,  especially  when  any  delay  in
    coming to the UK would have jeopardised the right of the younger son to
    come to the UK and thus made things more difficult for the family.

12. The appellant's mother and brother also gave evidence.  They  explained
    that they were sad that the appellant has not been able to join them in
    the UK. His father is sending him money every  month.  The  appellant's
    brother said that the appellant wanted to pursue higher  education  and
    get a better job, but he had no employment at the present time.

13. As Mr Avery submitted, the key issue in this appeal is whether there is
    family life between the appellant and the rest of the family in the UK.
    Whilst they chose to leave him behind, I accept on  the  evidence  that
    they could not afford to apply to bring him and had been  advised  that
    such an application would be refused. If they had delayed  much  longer
    than 2010, the appellant's younger brother would have reached  the  age
    of 18, making it difficult for him to accompany the parents to the  UK.
    He turned 18 in 2010, thus there was no time to lose. It must have been
    a difficult decision for the family but they did what they thought best
    at the time, based on the advice they had received. That  also  appears
    consistent with  the  refusal  decision  which  spelt  out  that  adult
    children would only be granted leave in exceptional circumstances.

14. I also find on the evidence that it was always  the  intention  of  the
    family for the appellant to join them in the UK, just as soon  as  they
    could afford the costs of an application to do  so.  I  find  that  the
    appellant has not established an independent life apart from his family
    or that he should be penalised for having to be left behind  in  Nepal.
    The respondent has not sought to challenge the fact that the  appellant
    remains financially dependent on his parents.

15. Whilst there has  been  a  voluntary,  on  the  part  of  the  parents,
    separation from the appellant, this  does  not  necessarily  break  the
    family ties and on the  facts  of  this  case  it  is  clear  that  the
    appellant retains close links both emotionally and financially with his
    family in the UK. They speak regularly and more significantly they have
    been back to visit him in Nepal. In essence, little has changed between
    the time when the appellant was under  18  and  now;  I  find  that  he
    remains a member of the family and has not yet established  a  life  of
    his own independent of the family, being still in education  and  still
    living in the family home.

16. I also find on the oral and written evidence of the father that had  he
    been able, he would have applied  for  settlement  in  the  UK  on  his
    discharge from the army and this would mean that all  of  the  children
    would have been entitled to residence in the UK.

17. I have considered the case law in the  appellant's  authorities  bundle
    and in particular Ghising and others  (Ghurkhas/BOCs;  historic  wrong;
    weight) [2013] UKUT 00567 (IAC), and Pun and others (Gurkhas - policy -
    article 8) Nepal, where it was held that financial dependency of choice
    so that the child can pursue further studies does not  mean  that  such
    dependency cannot properly be taken into account. In Kugathas,  it  was
    made clear that it is not essential that members of the  family  be  in
    the same country for family life to be capable of existence.

18. In UG (Nepal) & Ors v Entry Clearance Officer [2012] EWCA  Civ  58,  it
    was submitted on behalf of the Secretary of State that the  purpose  of
    the policy was to recognise military service and avoid  the  phenomenon
    of the 'stranded sibling,' whose parents and younger siblings have  all
    gone to the UK, leaving him alone in his own country. The  Tribunal  is
    entitled to consider the purpose of the policy.

19. At ï¿½25 of Pun, the Upper Tribunal agreed that article 8 cannot be  used
    as a device to exercise a discretion outside the Rules which  otherwise
    would not be open to the Tribunal, "but where an  assessment  is  being
    made of whether a decision is in breach  of  article  8,  it  would  be
    artificial to leave out of account  any  relevant  policy  particularly
    when assessing proportionality."

20. In Ghising it was held by the Upper Tribunal that:

         (1) In finding that the weight to be accorded to the historic wrong
         in Ghurkha ex-servicemen cases was not to be regarded as less  than
         that to be accorded the historic wrong suffered by British Overseas
         citizens, the Court of Appeal in Gurung and others [2013] EWCA  Civ
         8 did not hold that, in either Gurkha or BOC cases, the  effect  of
         the historic wrong is to reverse or otherwise alter the  burden  of
         proof that applies in Article 8 proportionality assessments.

         (2) When an Appellant has shown that there is  family/private  life
         and the decision made by the Respondent amounts to an  interference
         with it, the burden  lies  with  the  Respondent  to  show  that  a
         decision to remove is proportionate (although Appellants  will,  in
         practice, bear the responsibility of adducing  evidence  that  lies
         within their remit and about which the Respondent may be  unaware).



         (3) What concerned the Court in  Gurung  and  others  was  not  the
         burden  of  proof  but,  rather,  the  issue   of   weight   in   a
         proportionality assessment. The Court held that, as in the case  of
         BOCs, the historic wrong suffered by Gurkha ex-servicemen should be
         given substantial weight.

         (4) Accordingly, where it is found that Article 8 is  engaged  and,
         but for the historic wrong, the Appellant would have  been  settled
         in the UK long ago, this will ordinarily determine the  outcome  of
         the Article 8 proportionality assessment in an Appellant's  favour,
         where the matters relied  on  by  the  Secretary  of  State/  entry
         clearance  officer  consist  solely  of  the  public  interest   in
         maintaining a firm immigration policy.

         (5)  It can therefore be seen that Appellants in Gurkha  (and  BOC)
         cases will not necessarily succeed, even though  (i)  their  family
         life engages Article 8(1); and (ii) the evidence shows  they  would
         have come to the United Kingdom with  their  father,  but  for  the
         injustice that prevented the latter from settling here earlier.  If
         the Respondent can point to  matters  over  and  above  the  public
         interest in maintaining a firm immigration policy, which  argue  in
         favour of removal or the refusal of leave to enter,  these  matters
         must be given appropriate weight in the balance in the Respondent's
         favour. Thus, a bad immigration history and/or  criminal  behaviour
         may still be sufficient to outweigh the powerful factors bearing on
         the Appellant's side of the balance.

21. I should add that I have taken into account all those factors  set  out
    in section 117B of the 2002 Act and in particular that the  maintenance
    of immigration control is in the public interest.

22. In  all  the  circumstances,  I  do  give  substantial  weight  to  the
    historical injustice in the proportionality assessment. Taking all  the
    factors mentioned above into account, in the round, as a whole, I  find
    that the proportionality balance in this case comes clearly down in the
    appellant's favour. It would  be  unfair  and  unjustifiably  harsh  to
    prevent this appellant from joining his family in the UK. I have  found
    that was the  intention  from  the  outset  and  that  the  appellant's
    circumstances in Nepal are not such to have  broken  the  family  bond.
    There is family life even though they have been apart for some time and
    taking due account of both  the  public  interest  and  the  historical
    injustice and the purpose of the policy, the  Secretary  of  State  has
    failed to demonstrate that the decision was proportionate on the  facts
    of this case.



Conclusion & Decision:

23. For the reasons set out herein, I find that there is continuing  family
    life between the appellant and his family in the UK,  the  interference
    with which is sufficiently grave to engage article 8 ECHR. Applying the
    Razgar tests I also find for the reasons stated that  the  decision  of
    the Secretary of State was disproportionate.

     The appeal is allowed on human rights grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make a full fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been allowed.
