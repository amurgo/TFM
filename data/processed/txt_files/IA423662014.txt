Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr S Staunton, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Khosa in Person


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Although the Secretary of State is the Appellant in these proceedings I
    will refer to the parties as they were in the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. The Appellant, a national of India, appealed to the First-tier Tribunal
    against a decision of the  Respondent  dated  19th  September  2014  to
    refuse his application for leave to remain  in  the  UK  as  a  Tier  4
    Student Migrant.  Judge of the First-tier Tribunal VMD Fox allowed  his
    appeal and the Secretary of  State  appeals  with  permission  to  this
    Tribunal.

 3. The issue in this case is the date to be considered for the  assessment
    of the maintenance requirements in a Points Based System  appeal  where
    the Appellant varied his application due to a change of sponsor.

 4. The background to this appeal is that the Appellant made an application
    for leave to remain in the UK as a Tier 4  (General)  Student  on  29th
    October 2011.  However, the Sponsor was not on the relevant list and an
    Immigration Judge allowed the Appellant's appeal against the refusal of
    his application on the basis that the decision was  not  in  accordance
    with the law as a result of which the Appellant was granted 60 days  to
    obtain fresh sponsorship.  The Appellant obtained a  new  CAS  on  13th
    April 2012 and that was submitted  to  the  Secretary  of  State.   The
    Appellant submitted a fresh Bank statement. In her decision dated  19th
    September 2014 the Secretary of State considered that  application  but
    decided that the Appellant should not be awarded  any  of  the  claimed
    points for maintenance. This was because the  Barclays  Bank  statement
    submitted showed that he was not in possession of the  required  amount
    of �1,600 throughout the 28 day period prior to 13th  April  2012,  the
    date on which the variation of leave application was made.

 5. When the appeal came before First-tier Tribunal Judge  Fox  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge considered that the date  of  the  application  was
    29th October 2011 and considered the bank statements in relation to the
    period from 1st September 2011 until  31st  October  2011.   The  judge
    considered  that  the  Appellant  did  in  fact  meet   the   financial
    requirements during that period and allowed the appeal.

 6. The Secretary of State appealed to the Upper Tribunal.  The Grounds  of
    Appeal contend that the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  erred  in  that  he
    failed to consider  the  decision  in  Qureshi  (Tier  4  -  effect  of
    variation - App  C)  Pakistan  [2011]  UKUT  00412  (IAC).   The  Upper
    Tribunal decided in that case that the effective  date  of  application
    for the purposes of the calculation of the funding requirements,  where
    there has been a variation substituting a new college, is the  date  of
    the most recent variation.  As the Appellant's new CAS  was  issued  on
    13th April 2012 the Secretary of State submits that the  Judge  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal should have considered the financial evidence as at
    that date and that the judge therefore erred in law.

 7. At the hearing before me I heard submissions from Mr Staunton on behalf
    of the Secretary of State.  He relied on the decision  in  Qureshi  and
    highlighted paragraph 2 of the head note which states;

         "As to the date the respondent is required to take into account for
         the purposes of determining the points to be awarded under Appendix
         C, where there has been a variation substituting a new college,  it
         is the date of the  most  recent  variation  for  the  purposes  of
         paragraph 1A(c)."

 8. Mr Staunton submitted  that  the  bank  statements  considered  in  the
    reasons for refusal letter referred to the correct period and that  the
    judge erred in stating that the relevant date was  29th  October  2011.
    He submitted that this was a material error.

 9. The Appellant, Mr Khosa,  submitted  that  Judge  Fox  was  right.   He
    submitted that his application was made on 20th October 2011 and  that,
    following an appeal against the original decision,  he  was  allowed  a
    period of 60 days to submit a new CAS.  He submitted a copy of a letter
    dated 12th June 2012 which he received  from  the  Secretary  of  State
    asking for a number of documents.  The Secretary of State did  not  ask
    for an up-to-date bank statement. In any event he did send  a  copy  of
    the Barclays Bank statement dated 9th May 2012 even though he  had  not
    been asked for it.  He said that had the Secretary of State  asked  for
    him to demonstrate that he had access to further funds  he  would  have
    done so by arranging for more money to have been sent from home.

10. Mr Staunton submitted that it does not matter if more money could  have
    been arranged to have been sent from home because the  bank  statements
    showed that the required amount was not there for all of  the  required
    period.

Error of Law

11. I have considered all of the submissions and the evidence in this  case
    and it is clear on the basis of the  guidance  given  in  the  case  of
    Qureshi that First-tier Tribunal Judge Fox did  err  in  terms  of  the
    relevant  period  considered  for  the  purposes   of   the   financial
    requirements.  As the decision in Qureshi makes clear, it is  the  date
    of the variation which  is  the  relevant  date  for  the  purposes  of
    assessment of the maintenance requirements.  In this case that date  is
    13th April 2012.  The Barclays Bank statement is therefore the relevant
    bank statement for  the  purposes  of  assessment  of  the  maintenance
    requirements in this case.  The judge therefore  erred  in  considering
    that the date  of  the  application  was  29th  October  2011  and  his
    subsequent conclusions based on  the  financial  evidence  for  28  day
    period prior to that date are therefore wrong in  law.   Accordingly  I
    set aside the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Fox.

Remaking the Decision

12. As the appropriate date for the variation  application  is  13th  April
    2012 the relevant financial evidence is  that  contained  in  the  bank
    statement from Barclays Bank dated 9th  May  2012.   The  Secretary  of
    State correctly identifies the  relevant  period  in  the  reasons  for
    refusal letter as being between 17th March 2012 and  13th  April  2012.
    Between 17th March and 2nd April 2012 and 5th April and 13th April 2012
    the bank statements show  that  the  Appellant  was  in  possession  of
    between  �1,210.24  and  �1,430.24.   The  Appellant   only   met   the
    maintenance requirements from 3rd April to 4th April 2012 when  he  had
    �2,000.87 in his account.  In these circumstances the Appellant has not
    demonstrated that he had the required level of funds for  the  relevant
    period.  In these circumstances the Appellant's appeal cannot succeed.

13. I note the Appellant's submission that he attempted to comply with what
    the Secretary of State had asked for in  the  letter  dated  12th  June
    2012. I accept  that  the  letter  did  not  ask  for  up-to-date  bank
    statements.  I note that the Appellant said that had he been  aware  of
    the requirement to have met the financial  requirements  up  until  the
    date of the variation application he believes that he could  have  done
    so.  However the fact is that he did not do so and  that  unfortunately
    the financial evidence has not been provided to meet  the  requirements
    of the Rules.
