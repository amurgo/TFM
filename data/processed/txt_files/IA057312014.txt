For the Appellant:     Mr S Ahmad, Khans Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr S Whitwell, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant, Mr Zubair Khan, appeals with permission the decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Monson, sitting at Taylor  House  on  20  May
    2014 whereby, in  a  determination  promulgated  on  27  May  2014,  he
    dismissed the appellant's appeal against the decision of the respondent
    on 15 January 2014 to refuse to vary the appellant's leave to remain in
    the United Kingdom.  Permission to appeal was granted by the First-tier
    Tribunal on 4 July 2014.

2.   The  essence of the matter is as follows.  The  appellant  applied  for
    variation of leave in 2012 and  first  received  a  decision  from  the
    Secretary of State in February 2013.  The Secretary  of  State  decided
    that the application fell to be refused under paragraph 245ZXD  because
    the appellant had not shown that he had the  level  of  funds  required
    under Appendix C of the Rules.  He needed to show  evidence  of  ï¿½4,200
    maintenance for 28 days from 6 November 2012 to 3 December 2012 but the
    statements ran only from 24 November 2012.

3.   The appellant appealed against that decision and the appeal was  listed
    for hearing on 6 October 2013.   However the  respondent  notified  the
    Tribunal and the appellant's representatives that the decision appealed
    against had been withdrawn. Then on 15 January 2014  the  Secretary  of
    State gave her reasons for  re-refusing  the  application  made  on  18
    December 2012.  She found that it fell to be  refused  under  paragraph
    245ZXD of the Rules because the appellant had not shown that he had the
    level of funds required under paragraph C.  He needed to show  evidence
    of the maintenance figure previously mentioned for  the  period  of  28
    days from 6 November 2012 to 3 December 2012.   As  previously  stated,
    the statements submitted in support of the application only run from 24
    November 2012.

4.   It was then  said  that  the  evidence  subsequently  provided  by  the
    appellant had  been  "considered  against  our  evidential  flexibility
    policy but the Home Office will only request  further  documents  where
    such documents are known to exist but have not been submitted".

5.   At the appeal hearing before  Judge  Monson  the  appellant  gave  oral
    evidence.  He said that he had in fact provided two  pages  of  a  bank
    statement together comprising the requisite evidence over the  relevant
    period.

6.   At paragraph 21 of the determination, the judge said "By  the  time  of
    the second refusal decision the situation had changed.  The  respondent
    now had the earlier bank statement in  her  possession.  This  together
    with the later  statement  demonstrated  that  the  appellant  met  the
    maintenance requirement".

7.   The judge found that he was not satisfied that  the  appellant  had  in
    fact submitted both pages of the bank statement at the requisite  time,
    namely when the application was made.  He did so, noting amongst  other
    things that the application form referred only to the  provision  of  a
    bank statement in the singular.  There was also some acknowledgement by
    the appellant that this may have been the case,  in  that  he  insisted
    that even if he had not provided a first page, he  believed  he  should
    have been given the opportunity to submit the missing bank statement.

8.   The judge found as a fact that only one page had  been  submitted.   Mr
    Ahmad on behalf of the appellant, relying on the grounds, contends that
    the judge gave legally insufficient reasons for that finding.  I do not
    consider that to be the case.  What I have just recited makes it  plain
    that the judge gave a legally adequate reason and any challenge to that
    aspect of his determination is merely disagreement.

9.   I turn to the substance of the matter,  which  is  the  application  of
    paragraph 245AA of the Immigration Rules.  In its form as it was at the
    date of the 2014 decision that paragraph provided that where  specified
    documents had been submitted but some of the documents in the  sequence
    had been omitted, for example if one bank statement from a  series  was
    missing, or a document was in the wrong format or a document is a  copy
    and not an original document, or a document "does not  contain  all  of
    the specified information" then the Secretary of State "may contact the
    applicant or his representative in  writing  and  request  the  correct
    documents".

10.  The judge  considered  that  paragraph  245AA  did  not  apply  to  the
    present case.  Mr Ahmad criticises the findings of the  judge  in  this
    regard  which  are  to  be  found  at  paragraphs  19  and  20  of  the
    determination.  I agree that the reasoning,  certainly  in  the  second
    part of paragraph 20, appears somewhat obscure.  The nub of the matter,
    however, seems to me to be that in the decision of 15 January 2014, the
    respondent said this "We have considered whether the evidence  provided
    against our evidential  flexibility  policy.   However  we  would  only
    request further documents where such documents are known to  exist  but
    have  not  been  submitted.   As  this  is  not  the  case   evidential
    flexibility has not been applied."

11.  That reason for not applying paragraph 245AA is in my view  undoubtedly
    false.  It is false because, as is  now  accepted  on  all  sides,  and
    indeed was accepted it seems at the date of the  hearing  before  Judge
    Monson, the second page of the bank statement was with the Secretary of
    State by the time she took her decision in January 2014.  The reasoning
    of the Secretary of State accordingly is deficient.

12.  I would have found that  the  appellant  would  nevertheless  have  had
    difficulties in contending that paragraph 245AA applied,  were  it  not
    for the fact that paragraph  245AA(b)(iv)  refers  to  a  document  not
    containing all the specified information. In the circumstances, I am in
    agreement with Mr Ahmad that the single bank statement did not  contain
    all the specified information and, given that the  Secretary  of  State
    must by the date of decision have known that that  was  the  case,  and
    furthermore that there was evidence before her that  plainly  indicated
    that this was a failing that could be rectified by  the  appellant,  in
    all those circumstances it was incumbent upon the Secretary of State to
    give consideration to paragraph 245AA of the Immigration Rules.

13.  I therefore find that the determination of the judge contains an  error
    of law.  The judge's reasoning of  paragraph  245AA  is  deficient.   I
    therefore set aside his  determination  and  re-make  the  decision  by
    allowing the appellant's appeal against the decision to the extent that
    that decision is found by me not to  be  in  accordance  with  the  law
    because a proper decision, applying paragraph 245AA, still requires  to
    be made.

14.  It is not for me to dictate or  even  to  seek  to  influence  how  the
    Secretary of State may proceed.  However, the Secretary  of  State  may
    well feel in the circumstances that this is a  case  which,  given  the
    prolonged history and the fact that the appellant plainly can meet  the
    requirements  of  the  substantive  Rules,  may  merit  the  grant   of
    substantive leave to remain.

Appeal allowed.
