                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal made by the parents of a child whom I shall refer  to
    as D against the determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Widdup
    following a hearing that took  place  on  6  December  2017  and  whose
    determination was promulgated on 18 December 2017.

 2. I refer to D as being the principal actor in this case because she is a
    child who was born on 19 November 2009.  She was aged 8 at the date  of
    hearing on 6 December 201, and is aged 8 still, although  will  shortly
    be aged 9.  She was born in the United Kingdom.  However,  her  parents
    are citizens of India and their effective leave was curtailed in  April
    2011.  Had the family left in 2011, D would necessarily have left  with
    them and would have then been 15 months old.

 3. The case was first determined by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Troup  who
    made a decision on 1 December  2014.   It  was  a  decision  which  was
    similar to the decision that was made by the judge in the appeal before
    me.  Judge Troup determined that the interests of D  did  not  outweigh
    the public interest in removing her.  At that stage I can properly say,
    how could those  interests  have  outweighed  the  public  interest  in
    removing her?  D was then just 5 years old.  She  had  been  at  school
    since I think May 2012.  Inevitably Judge Troup took into account that,
    during the first four years of her life or so at least, her  world  was
    centred upon her parents' domestic life, albeit not exclusively because
    of the interactions that she had with other  children  at  her  nursery
    school.  Consequently, when the same application was made and heard  by
    the judge in December 2017 he properly used as his starting point  what
    had been found by Judge Troup and which  was  not  appealed  and  which
    could not reasonably have  been  appealed.  Judge  Widdup  was  clearly
    focussing on the fact  that  time  had  passed  and  circumstances  had
    changed in the intervening three  years  since  the  matter  last  came
    before the Tribunal.

 4. In his determination the judge set out  the  immigration  history.   He
    referred to the evidence that had been provided by  the  parents.   The
    father had given evidence.  He said that, whilst his leave had  expired
    in April 2011, he had been running a business and had no other means of
    support.  His daughter was then at a state school.  Formerly,  she  had
    been in a private school which had cost between �8,000 and  �9,000  per
    annum.  He expressed the view that there were no good schools in  India
    and she would have to go to a city.  He had said that they  would  find
    it very hard to establish themselves in India.  They had no connections
    there.  It is true he accepted that his parents live in India but there
    is no other family there.  He was asked about the business that he ran.
     He does delivery work to courier companies.  He has got five vans  and
    his drivers are all self-employed.  The business was set up in 2012  at
    a time of course when he had no leave to  remain.   I  accept,  as  the
    judge appears to have accepted, that the business was doing  well.   It
    was put to him why he could not use that same resourcefulness in India.
     He responded that he had lost his contacts and he would find  it  very
    hard.  However, the judge noted that he had a chemistry degree and  was
    clearly a man of some education.  He talked about his parents living in
    Gujarat in a small town and the fact that, although there is a  private
    school, the nearest city  is  some  60  kilometres  away.   D's  father
    reiterated that he would lose his future and that he had nothing to  go
    back to.

 5. D's mother also gave  evidence  relying  upon  her  witness  statement.
    There was an issue as to whether or not the family  spoke  Gujarati  in
    the home.  D's mother is a bookkeeper in her  husband's  business.   In
    India she had worked as a laboratory assistant.  Necessarily,  she  was
    asked whether she could work in India.  She said that, when she worked,
    she was paid just a very small amount of money.  She had no  experience
    in the Indian workplace and did not know if her credentials  would  get
    her a job.  She herself explained that she had a  degree  in  food  and
    nutrition but she could not, she said, use that  qualification  to  get
    her a job in India.  She said that the family speak English at home and
    they do not use Gujarati because their daughter did not understand  it.
    However, that was contrasted with what Judge Troup had  found  in  2014
    where he said at paragraph 44 that D had been brought up in a household
    in which Gujarati was the first language and she could  understand  it,
    although she could only speak a few words of it.  As a result of  that,
    the mother was recalled by her Counsel and gave evidence with reference
    to the language ability of the daughter D.

 6. It is clear that the most significant factor in the mind of  the  judge
    was that the circumstances had principally changed in that the daughter
    had lived in the UK for more than seven years.  This  of  course  is  a
    reference to the  factors  that  have  to  be  taken  into  account  in
    paragraph 276ADE(1) and also s. 117B of the 2002  Act;  in  particular,
    sub-s. (6).  So it was clear that the judge had been  referred  to  the
    most significant legal factors  that  he  was  required  to  take  into
    account.  He was of course dealing with a human rights appeal  and  was
    concerned with the interaction that exists between proportionality  (in
    relation to which he was required to strike a balance) and the  overlap
    of the statutory provisions to which I have earlier referred.  That  is
    clear from paragraphs 40 and 41 of his determination.

 7. It is also clear from paragraph 42 of the determination that the  judge
    correctly advised himself that the daughter's interests were a  primary
    consideration but added that they were not determinative, as indeed  is
    the legal position.  The judge then went on to consider the  daughter's
    best  interests  and  did  so  by  reference  to  the  evidence  of  an
    independent  social  worker,  Mr  Musendo.   Mr  Musendo's  report  was
    considered at some length and no specific criticism  was  made  of  the
    judge's  approach  to  it,  encapsulated  in  paragraph   50   of   his
    determination in which he decided that only  limited  weight  could  be
    attached to it.  It was obviously a matter to which weight  had  to  be
    attached and it was a matter for the judge  to  determine  what  weight
    should be attached to it.

 8. But when considering the evidence of the parents the judge in paragraph
    43 approached his task by finding that the evidence of the parents  had
    to assessed with a considerable degree of caution.   He  sets  out  his
    reasons why he needed to do so and then spoke about the deficiencies in
    the evidence.  It is submitted that the deficiencies were such that the
    judge should have required an adjournment.  I note that  the  appellant
    was represented by solicitors, Malik Law, and that firm was the subject
    of  an  intervention  by  the  Solicitors  Regulation  Authority  which
    resulted in their being forced to close down on 18  April  2018.   That
    was of course some three or so months  after  the  hearing  before  the
    judge, but importantly I note that the appellant was represented by  Ms
    Heybroek of Counsel of whom I  have  some  experience  and  who  is  an
    experienced practitioner in these matters.  No application was made  by
    her for an adjournment, no refusal was made, and the material that  was
    before the Tribunal was material which included an expert  report.   It
    also included a report from Gower  House,  thereby  acknowledging  that
    there should be some evidence from her school but there was no evidence
    from  the  school  which  the   daughter   was   currently   attending.
    Justifiably the judge considered this was something  that  should  have
    been available if it was to  be  suggested  that  the  child  would  be
    harmed, that the  interference  would  be  such  that  she  should  not
    reasonably be required to leave her schooling in the United Kingdom.

 9. I therefore reject the suggestion made on behalf of the appellant by Mr
    Canter that this was a case where it was so obvious that  the  evidence
    was lacking that the judge should have adjourned the matter of his  own
    motion and required better  evidence.   There  was  evidence  from  the
    school, there was evidence from the parents, there was evidence from  a
    privately paid social worker in the form of Mr  Musendo's  report.   It
    cannot therefore be said that it was a Wednesbury unreasonable decision
    to refuse to adjourn the matter of his own motion.

10. When one therefore looks at the criticisms which are made  in  relation
    to the evidence the judge rightly points out that, for  example,  there
    was no evidence from friends or from  a  teacher;  that  was  factually
    correct.  As there was  no  such  evidence,  the  judge  was  factually
    correct in referring to the paucity of evidence.  Thus, in paragraph 45
    for example, he referred to the fact that there was  no  evidence  from
    anyone outside the family.   The  only  evidence  from  the  daughter's
    school consists of two reports and a  series  of  certificates.   That,
    too, was factually correct.  Ms Heybroek, it was said, did not refer to
    them in her submissions but cannot be  criticised  for  not  doing  so.
    Accordingly, in paragraph 46, the failure to produce evidence  relating
    to the daughter's friends and education in London and  in  relation  to
    their home area in India and other matters  entitled  him  to  draw  an
    adverse inference from the  fact  there  was  no  evidence  that  would
    support the family's case that it would be unreasonable,  unlawful  and
    disproportionate to remove the child at the age  of  8.   Paragraph  46
    therefore is accepted as being factually correct.

11. The judge then went on to deal with the inconsistencies in the mother's
    evidence.  This is dealt with at paragraphs 47  to  49.   The  material
    before the judge is referred to in paragraphs 58  and  59:  the  report
    from Gower House School of July 2016.  It stated, as one would hope  to
    see, that D had worked hard and produced  excellent  work.   The  judge
    accepted that Mr Musendo quoted from the daughter's year 3  report  and
    found that those  reports  were  impressive,  although  he  would  have
    preferred to have seen the reports themselves.  It  is  clear  that  he
    took into account the fact that the child was doing well at school,  as
    one would expect in relation to a child who has spent some two years or
    more in the United Kingdom's  education  system,  in  addition  to  the
    period of time spent at nursery school.

12. The judge then referred to the decision in MA and considered whether or
    not the stage at which D had reached in her education was a stage which
    could properly be called critical.  He said in paragraph 67 that she is
    not at a critical stage; she  was  not,  for  example,  about  to  take
    examinations; she was  at  an  age  when  her  education  could  resume
    elsewhere; she appears to be intelligent enough to adapt as  one  would
    expect her to be able to adapt to a new educational system, were she to
    be required to move, as many children do move as  the  requirements  of
    their parents' work commitments require them to travel from  one  place
    to another.  It cannot therefore be said that, as  a  general  rule,  a
    child cannot be expected to leave the school at which she is settled.

13. The judge then went on to say that he was satisfied that the child  was
    familiar with Gujarati cultural norms.  There may  be  some  linguistic
    difficulties but the daughter had some  knowledge  of  Gujarati;  there
    were no health issues and D was  not  a  British  citizen.   The  judge
    repeated that he had taken into account the public interest  provisions
    of the 2014 Act, that is of course a reference to the insertion of Part
    5A into the 2002 Act,  and  found  that  D's  parents  were  both  well
    qualified and intelligent.  Although criticism is made as  the  judge's
    reliance upon the child's immigration situation being precarious, I  am
    satisfied that paragraph 73 of the determination is a reference to  the
    parents' immigration status being precarious, as indeed it was and  has
    been since April 2011 when the father's work permit was curtailed.

14. Finally, the judge concluded in paragraph 74, and I quote:

         "Each case involving the best interests of a child is  highly  fact
         sensitive and dependent on the evidence presented and the  findings
         of  fact  made.   The  evidential  omissions  in  this   case   are
         substantial and have been caused by the failure of the  parents  to
         present the Tribunal with  a  full  and  informed  picture  of  the
         daughter's present  circumstances  and  of  her  likely  future  in
         India".

15. Mr Tarlow submits that that is a proper proportionality assessment  and
    in my judgment what the judge was saying was that the parents' evidence
    about some important and significant elements of their case was lacking
    in frankness and that he was not prepared to  accept  the  entirety  of
    their evidence as to the difficulties they would  face  in  India  were
    they to be returned there with  their  child.   However,  paragraph  75
    makes it crystal clear that the judge was attaching significant  weight
    to the fact that the child had been in the United Kingdom for a further
    three years since First-tier Tribunal Judge Troup decided on 1 December
    2014 that it was not unlawful to remove her.   The  judge  encapsulated
    the changes that had been made by saying:

         "Taking all the evidence in  the  round,  I  find  that  the  other
         factors, and particularly the  family  connections  in  India,  the
         daughter's Indian citizenship and  the  familiarity  with  cultural
         norms, her age and the fact that her education is not at a critical
         stage, do amount to strong reasons for saying that, notwithstanding
         the significant weight to be attached to the seven years plus  that
         she has spent in the United Kingdom".

    For those reasons he concluded it not be unreasonable to expect her  to
    leave the United Kingdom.

16. The criticism that is made by Mr Canter is that the judge  has  stymied
    himself, to use his expression, by reaching a conclusion that there was
    no substantial evidence about her best interests and  that  meant  that
    the judge was forced to adjourn the  matter  to  find  that  additional
    evidence.  I do not consider that the judge stymied himself.  The judge
    had to deal with the material  that  was  before  him.   That  included
    school reports albeit school reports  out  of  date;  it  included  the
    evidence of the parents which was critically examined by the judge;  it
    also included the report  of  Mr  Musendo  which  was  also  critically
    examined by the judge and to which he attached an appropriate degree of
    weight  but  not  a  determinative  amount   of   weight.    In   those
    circumstances I do  not  find  that  the  judge  was  either  under  an
    obligation to adjourn the matter nor did he stymie himself in  the  way
    that is suggested by his commenting upon the paucity of  evidence  upon
    which he had to make his decision that the best interests of the  child
    outweighed the fact that the parents were  able  to  make  a  life  for
    themselves and their daughter were they to be returned to India.  It is
    said that there was not a best interests assessment  nor  was  there  a
    proper proportionality assessment but that is  simply  incorrect.   The
    judge considered all of the material that was before him, material that
    went both to the position as far as the child was concerned as well  as
    the matters which were acting in favour of the family's removal, namely
    that the parents were well able to make a home for their  daughter  and
    themselves on return to India.

17. Finally, I should properly refer to the case of MT and ET (child's best
    interests; ex tempore pilot) Nigeria [2018] UKUT 00088 (IAC).  This was
    a decision made by the President, Lane  J,  and  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    Lindsley.  It records in many respects the obvious that there had to be
    powerful reasons to remove a child who had spent seven years where  the
    child had reached a stage in  her  development  where  there  would  be
    significant interference, (I would describe it as harm) , if the  child
    were removed to a different country.   However,  the  gravamen  of  the
    decision is that a very young child who has not started school  or  who
    has only recently done so will have difficulty in establishing that her
    Article 8 private and family life has a  material  element  which  lies
    outside her need to live with her parent or parents wherever  they  may
    be.  Necessarily that situation changes over time,  as  the  judge  was
    well aware of when comparing Judge Troup's decision with the  one  that
    he had to make,  with  the  result  that  an  assessment  of  the  best
    interests of a child must change as a  child  develops.   In  the  case
    before the presidential  panel  in  MT  and  ET  one  of  the  relevant
    children, was a child who was commencing GCSE examinations, had been in
    the United Kingdom for ten years.  Accordingly, the  seven  years  that
    was the material consideration in her case fell  at  a  very  different
    stage in her development than it does in the present case.   The  focus
    necessarily was then upon the fact-sensitive assessment that has to  be
    made in these cases.  There can be no blanket consideration that  seven
    years is sufficient to outweigh any public interest.  Each case is fact-
    sensitive and, indeed, as Mr Canter suggested, no 8-year-old  is  going
    to be the same.  I entirely agree with that.  That is, if I may say so,
    the beauty of an asylum and immigration system which does not  look  at
    generalities but looks at the individual circumstances of a case and in
    particular the specific evidence that is placed before the  judge  upon
    which he  makes  his  assessment.   That  is  exactly  what  First-tier
    Tribunal  Judge  Widdup  did  in  the  determination  that   is   under
    examination this morning.  I am quite satisfied that the judge  reached
    not only a sustainable decision but a  decision  from  which  no  other
    judge could reasonably have differed on the material  that  was  before
    him.  In such circumstances I do not find that  there  was  a  material
    error of law.

DECISION

18. Accordingly, I dismiss the  appellants'  appeal  and  direct  that  the
    determination of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.

No anonymity direction is made.
