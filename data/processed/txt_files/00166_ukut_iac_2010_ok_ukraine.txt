Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr E Wilford, Counsel instructed by Advisa
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms Z Kiss, Home Office Presenting Officer

1. The Respondent's  transitional  provisions  in  relation  to  Maintenance
   (Funds) requirements, ending on 31 October 2008, are not to  be  confused
   or conflated with the transitional provisions for Attributes and  English
   Language for those remaining on the  IGS/SEGS/FT:WISS  schemes  after  30
   June 2008.

2. While an applicant may be entitled to the benefit  of  both  transitional
   provisions where an application for Tier 1  (Post-Study  Work)  was  made
   before  31  October   2008,   applicants   wishing   to   transfer   from
   IGS/SEGS/FT:WISS to Tier 1 (Post-Study Work) whose applications were made
   after that date will need to meet the Maintenance (Funds) requirement  in
   the normal way.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1. The appellant, a Ukrainian citizen, appeals against the determination  of
   Immigration Judge Abebrese dismissing her appeal against the decision  of
   the Respondent to refuse to vary  her  leave  to  remain  in  the  United
   Kingdom to change her status  from  the  International  Graduates  Scheme
   (IGS) to be a Tier 1 (Post-Study Work) Migrant pursuant to paragraph 245Z
   (e) of the Immigration Rules HC 395 (as amended).

2. The issue before the AIT was whether that decision  was  consistent  with
   the transitional arrangements which the Respondent put in place with  the
   introduction of the Points-Based System. The  only  point  at  issue  was
   whether the appellant could meet the Maintenance (Funds)  requirement  as
   it appeared that she had not had personal savings at the  level  of  �800
   for the three month period  preceding  her  application,  in  this  case,
   between 12 November 2008 and 11 February 2009 (the funding period).   The
   United Kingdom bank account showed  that  the  appellant's  account  fell
   consistently below that minimum.   A  letter  from  her  bankers  in  the
   Ukraine, Ykpcousahk  Bank,  was  not  supported  by  a  letter  from  the
   financial institution governing the banks of Ukraine, and gave  only  the
   balance in her account on  one  date.   It  was  not  evidence  that  any
   particular level of funds was available throughout the three month period
   specified above.

3. The appellant also made a human  rights  claim.   She  had  been  in  the
   United Kingdom for seven years, was in a serious relationship  and  lived
   with her boyfriend.  She had 'baptised a boy who is five years  old'  but
   it was unclear whether this was her child.   She  was  working,  and  was
   valued in the school where she taught.  She considered that it  would  be
   difficult for her to adapt to life in the Ukraine  on  her  return.   The
   majority  of  her  family  members  were  still  in  the  Ukraine.    The
   Immigration Judge dismissed the appeal on immigration  and  human  rights
   grounds.

4. The appellant challenged the Article 8 element of  the  determination  as
   disproportionate, arguing that the Tribunal had failed properly to  apply
   the judgment of the House of Lords in Huang [2007] UKHL 11  at  paragraph
   19.

5. She mounted a vigorous challenge to paragraph 245Z(e),  complaining  that
   no decision had been made on her request to cite a number  of  unreported
   determinations, and that it was an error of law for the Immigration Judge
   to consider that the post-study work transitional provisions  were  clear
   and unambiguous.

6. On 28 July 2009, SIJ Chalkley ordered reconsideration.  He refused  leave
   on  Article  8  and  on  the  unreported  determinations  questions   but
   considered that 'the judge may have materially erred in law by failing to
   consider and apply the applicable Transitional Arrangements'.  The appeal
   came before a panel of two SIJs for full  reconsideration  on  5  January
   2010, but although the panel agreed on its decision shortly  after  that,
   it was not possible to finalise the determination before the  AIT  ceased
   to exist on 15 February 2010.  The  appellant  did  not  appear  to  give
   evidence and it was clear from difficulties during the hearing  that  her
   representatives did not have up-to-date instructions from her.

7. Pursuant to Schedule 4 to the Transfer of Functions  of  the  Asylum  and
   Immigration Tribunal Order 2010 (SI 2010/21):

    "4.   Where  the  reconsideration  of  an  appeal  by  the  Asylum  and
    Immigration Tribunal under section 103A of the 2002 Act  has  commenced
    before  15  February  2010   but   has   not   been   determined,   the
    reconsideration shall continue as an appeal to the Upper Tribunal under
    section 12 of the 2007 Act and section 13 of the 2007 Act shall apply."

8. This appeal accordingly falls to be determined as an  appeal  before  the
   Upper Tribunal. We have reminded ourselves that the standard of proof  in
   immigration  appeals  is  the  ordinary  civil  standard  of  balance  of
   probabilities.

Evidence before the original Tribunal:  Appellant's bundle

9. The Tribunal has the benefit of the appellant's bundle of evidence  which
   was before the original Immigration Judge.  In a statement signed  on  23
   May 2009, the appellant stated that:

    "8.    I was quite upset to find out that my Tier 1  (Post-Study  Work)
    application was refused. I have always followed all the requirements of
    the Home Office and because I was a participant  of  the  International
    Guidance Scheme (IGS) I  thought  that  the  Transitional  Arrangements
    would  be  applied  and  that  I  did  not  need  to  meet  any  points
    requirements or that I only had to demonstrate �800 in  my  account  at
    the end of each month or on the date of  my  application.   Besides  my
    initial solicitor who assisted me with my application confirmed that my
    net income of �880 per  month  would  be  enough  to  qualify  for  the
    programme.  Unfortunately that solicitor provided me with wrong  advice
    and because I relied on that advice, my application was rejected."

10. She goes on to refer to having lived in the  United  Kingdom  for  seven
   years and having 'baptised a boy' who was more than five and a half years
   old.  If that is her own son, then the Maintenance  (Funds)  requirements
   should be higher by �533.

11. The appellant  produced  a  copy  of  the  Immigration  Rules  which  at
   paragraph 245Z (e) state that the applicant must have  a  minimum  of  10
   points under paragraphs 1-2 of Appendix C.   The appellant also  produced
   Appendix C which stated that:

    "Tier 1 Migrants

      1. An applicant applying for entry clearance or leave to remain  as  a
         Tier 1 Migrant (other than as a Tier  1  (Investor)  Migrant)  must
         score 10 points for funds.

      2. 10 points will only be awarded if an applicant ...

          b) Applying for leave to remain, has the level of funds  shown  in
             the table below and provides the specified documents.

          Level of funds                                      Points
               �800                                                     10"

12. That is absolutely clear.  However, the Respondent's website  commentary
   was in the following terms:

    "Tier 1 (Post-Study Work) - IGS - transitional arrangement

    If your leave to remain on the basis of IGS or SEGS expired before 30th
    June 2008, you will not be eligible to apply  for  an  extension  under
    Points-Based System Tier 1 (Post-Study Work).

    If you have valid leave to remain under IGS or SEGS on  or  after  30th
    June 2008, you will be able to apply to extend your permission to  stay
    in your existing category.  You will not be required to meet the points
    requirement if you are applying under  this  transitional  arrangement.
    You can apply under these Transitional Arrangements at  any  time  from
    30th June 2008.  If your application is successful you will receive  an
    extra year from the date your visa is due to expire.  You will need  to
    use application form Tier 1 (Post-Study Work), which  is  available  on
    the UK Border Agency website at:

    http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/workingintheuk/tier1/poststudy/

    If your application is successful you will be granted further leave  to
    remain, up to a combined total of two years in your  existing  category
    and the Post Study Work category, during which time you will be free to
    seek employment without having a sponsor.

    Please note, you cannot make an application  under  these  Transitional
    Arrangements if you are not in the United Kingdom.

    You will be able to apply to switch in the United Kingdom from  Tier  1
    (Post-Study Work)  to Tier 1 (General,  Investor  or  Entrepreneur)  or
    Work Permit employment (Tier 2 when implemented), or  Student  (Tier  4
    when implemented) or  Student  (Tier  4  when  implemented).   However,
    please note, time spent in the United Kingdom in the Tier 1 (Post-Study
    Work) category  does  not  count  towards  the  qualifying  period  for
    Indefinite Leave to Remain."

   Tier 4 was implemented on 31 March 2009.

13. The appellant also relies on a chain of emails sent  to  and  from  Lisa
   Amin and the UKBA in relation to a different appellant,  which  (in  date
   order, and so far as relevant) was as follows:

14.

|14 November     |Student asks for guidance to application for Tier 1      |
|2008:           |(Post-Study Work) as replacement for remaining year of   |
|                |IGS.  The student explains that most of his money has    |
|                |been sent home and so he cannot show �800 in the United  |
|                |Kingdom for the entire three months before the           |
|                |application.  The student asks whether it is necessary to|
|                |do so.                                                   |
|1 December 2008 |Urgent reminder as no response received                  |
|3 December 2008 |UKBA responded:                                          |
|                |"Dear Sir/Madam                                          |

|                |(Post-Study Work) or Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) from within   |

|                |documents showing they have had savings of at least �800 |
|                |for at least three months before applying.  If the       |
|                |balance has dipped below �800 during the three month     |
|                |period, the requirement will not be met.                 |
|                |If they are including dependants in their application or |
|                |applying separately for dependants, they will need to    |

15.  Thus  far,  the  correspondence  supports  the  Respondent's   declared
   position.  The applicant in the email chain then challenged the response,
   quoting from the Transitional Arrangements automated email response:



|4 December 2008 |"Thanks a lot for your response.  My case falls in below |
|                |category "Tier 1 (Post-Study Work) - IGS - transitional  |
|                |arrangement" and as per automated response, there are no |
|                |points requirements to be meet, which means not even for |
|                |maintenance requirement, am I correct in understanding   |
|                |this?                                                    |
|                |If your leave to remain on the basis of IGS or SEGS      |
|                |expired before 30th  June 2008, you will not be eligible |
|                |to apply for an extension under Points-Based System Tier |
|                |1 (Post-Study Work).                                     |

|                |will not be required to meet the points requirement if   |
|                |you are applying under this transitional arrangement. You|
|                |can apply under these Transitional Arrangements at any   |
|                |time from 30th June 2008.  If your application is        |
|                |successful you will receive an extra year from the date  |

|8 December 2008 |The UKBA auto response replied with the same response as |
|                |the appellant had quoted, signed 'Wayne Fairweather,     |
|                |Immigration  Group, UK  Border Agency'                   |
|9 December 2008 |The applicant asked what she was supposed to do with the |
|                |form:                                                    |
|                |"When I am filling up forms, it requires me to fill      |
|                |section for Maintenance (Funds) Requirement.  What am I  |
|                |suppose to do with this section, as you have mentioned no|
|                |points requirements for Tier 1 (Post-Study Work) - IGS - |
|                |transitional arrangement.  Please can you guide me what  |
|                |shall I fill in for above section                        |
|4 February 2009 |The UKBA replied as follows:                             |
|                |"Dear Sir                                                |

|                |you have filled out section 3b You will not be required  |
|                |to meet the points requirement if you are applying under |
|                |this transitional arrangement.                           |
|                |Please send as much documentary evidence to support your |
|                |application.                                             |

16. That response, which appears to be a modified  auto  response,  suggests
   that the Transitional Arrangements did not end on  31  October  2008  but
   were still in force on 4 February 2010.  However, the appellant  was  not
   personally misled by it and never relied upon it; the correspondence  was
   not with her or her  representatives,  and  Lisa  Amin  (one  hopes  with
   authority) later made it available to the appellant's representatives for
   use in these proceedings.

Additional evidence for reconsideration hearing: Respondent's  Supplementary
Bundle

17. Ms Kiss acknowledged that there were  some  infelicities  in  the  email
   chain and the auto response which was unhelpful.  She had endeavoured  to
   resolve the matter by extracting as many timed  versions  of  the  policy
   guidance from the Respondent's website as she could.  The first  document
   is   the   eligibility   guidance   to   be   found    on    the    link:
   http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/workingintheuk/tier1/poststudy/eligibili
   ty from 11 November 2008 which stated that different points  requirements
   existed for those on the IGS and that an applicant 'should read  all  the
   information in this section before you apply'.  An undated document about
   the transitional  arrangement  stated  that  IGS  holders  must  have  no
   recourse to public funds 'which means you will not be able to claim  most
   benefits paid by the state'.  No other financial  requirement  was  there
   specified.

18. The next document is the auto response text for 2  January  2009  which,
   after setting out the �800 requirement for Tier 1 (Post-Study Work)  then
   sets out the Tier 1 (Post-Study Work) - IGS -  Transitional  Arrangements
   with no mention of maintenance as long as the  IGS  leave  was  still  in
   force on 30 June 2008.  It is common  ground  that  the  appellant  never
   received that auto response, because she never  emailed  UKBA  about  the
   point.

19. On 16 January 2009, the  policy  guidance  changed  again  but  the  IGS
   transitional provisions remained the same. On 2 March 2009, there  was  a
   further revision, but  the  text  for  IGS  transitional  provisions  was
   unchanged.

20. On 19 May 2009, there was a further modification, and  the  transitional
   provisions now included  the  following  sentence  for  the  first  time:
   "However, please note that you will need to meet the  points  requirement
   for maintenance" before directing the applicant to the form, as  did  all
   the previous versions.

21. Three copies of the Tier 1 (Post-Study Work)  Migrant  application  form
   appear in the bundle.  The first, at Tab E,  seems  to  be  the  relevant
   version for this appeal since it relates to applications made on or after
   27 November 2008. It states that applicants need  to  read  the  separate
   policy guidance notes for the form.  At  the  beginning  of  Section  3B,
   Transitional Arrangements, the appellant is referred again to the  policy
   guidance notes.

22. Section 3B requires 75 points  for  Attributes  under  the  Transitional
   Arrangements, but says that leave under any  of  three  categories  (IGS,
   SEGS or FT:WISS) equates to 75 points.  The applicant is then directed to
   section 4M (English language), which indicates that where  the  applicant
   has 75 points under Attributes (as IGS  scheme  members  will  have),  10
   points for English language will  be  awarded.   The  applicant  is  next
   directed to section N, Maintenance (Funds),  which  contains  no  similar
   exception, and then on, through the rest of the form.

23. The second, at tab G, is for applications made  on  or  after  31  March
   2009 and the final version of the form (Tab F) is for  applications  made
   on or after 1 October 2009.  They are all in the same  terms.   It  seems
   clear that  the  policy  guidance  is  expressly  incorporated  into  the
   completion of the form, but  the  application  forms  themselves  do  not
   appear to us to be determinative of the question whether the  Maintenance
   (Funds) requirement must be met by those on Transitional Arrangements for
   IGS, SEGS or FT:WISS.

24. Four versions of the policy guidance are produced.  The  first  in  time
   went live on 9 August 2008: at paragraph 86 thereof, it states that under
   the Transitional Arrangements of Tier 1 (Post-Study Work) applicants must
   score (inter alia) 10 points for Maintenance  (Funds)  and  paragraph  87
   states that such applicants must have '�800 of available  funds'.   Under
   Maintenance (Funds), the next heading is "Maintenance requirement  -  all
   applications" and states that 'Applicants in the United  Kingdom  seeking
   further leave to remain must have at least �800 of personal savings which
   must have been held for at least  three  months  prior  to  the  date  of
   application". The next version of the policy guidance went  live  on  the
   UKBA website in January 2009.  It is the same. The other two versions are
   later than the appellant's application and do not assist us.

The hearing

25. The Tribunal had the benefit of a supplementary skeleton argument by  Mr
   Ellis Wilford, Counsel for the appellant. He noted that the facts in this
   appeal were 'extremely similar' to those in SK  (Tier  1  -  transitional
   provision - maintenance) Republic of Korea [2009] UKAIT 00032,  in  which
   the AIT had held that  the  Transitional  Arrangements  applied  only  to
   applications made on or before 31 October 2008, but that the Tribunal  in
   that determination misunderstood the email  chain  as  being  disjunctive
   rather than a coherent account of an attempt by an unnamed  appellant  to
   obtain more information about a conflict between the Tier  1  (Post-Study
   Work)  application form and the supporting guidance,  including  guidance
   given by the auto response emails.

26. The appellant accepted that during the funding period, her bank  account
   fell below �800.  She argued that the Respondent's policy guidance as  to
   the required level of funds was  ultra  vires  and  the  Tribunal  had  a
   discretion as to the level of funds required.   The  appellant  contended
   that the email chain, should be regarded as being in  the  public  domain
   and creating, for this  appellant,  a  legitimate  expectation  that  her
   application also would be subject to transitional  provisions  which  did
   not require her to demonstrate savings amounting to �800 for every day of
   the funding period.

27. The UKBA guidance is referred to in appendix C of the Immigration  Rules
   which sets out the  Maintenance  (Funds)  qualifications.  The  appellant
   submitted that the email chain indicated that those who enquired  of  the
   UKBA  whether  or  not  they  had  to  satisfy  the  Maintenance  (Funds)
   requirements were informed that they need not do  so  if  their  previous
   leave had been granted under the IGS scheme.  The specific  IGS  guidance
   did, therefore, give rise to a legitimate expectation not limited to  the
   Points-Based System criteria of Attributes and command of English and  SK
   (paragraphs 33-35) was wrong.  The email chain was 'fresh evidence'.

28. In submissions, Ms Kiss said that those emails were  sent  from  a  UKBA
   public mail box and accepted that there was an element of misdirection in
   the standard paragraphs used.  She accepted that some people  might  have
   received such an email but not the present appellant, and the application
   form clearly directed all applicants to the Respondent's policy guidance.
   The email chain was not 'new evidence' in the Ladd v Marshall  sense,  as
   summarised in E v Secretary of State for Home Department [2004] EWCA  Civ
   49 (usually known as E and R)
    "23.   ii) New evidence will normally be admitted  only  in  accordance
    with "Ladd v Marshall principles" (see Ladd v  Marshall  [1954]  1  WLR
    1489), applied with some additional  flexibility  under  the  CPR  (see
    Hertfordshire Investments Ltd v Bubb [2000] 1  WLR  2318,  2325;  White
    Book para 52.11.2). The Ladd v Marshall  principles  are,  in  summary:
    first, that the fresh  evidence  could  not  have  been  obtained  with
    reasonable diligence for use at the trial; secondly, that if given,  it
    probably would have had an important  influence  on  the  result;  and,
    thirdly, that  it  is  apparently  credible  although  not  necessarily
    incontrovertible. As a general rule,  the  fact  that  the  failure  to
    adduce the evidence was that of the party's legal advisers provides  no
    excuse: see Al-Mehdawi v Home Secretary [1990] 1AC 876."

   The Tribunal should uphold the reasoning of SIJ Batiste in SK.

29. Mr Wilford then applied for an adjournment  to  take  full  instructions
   from the appellant and to await the outcome of a case pending before  the
   Court of Appeal called Marinkovic which might  be  determinative  of  the
   point.  The Administrative Court had stayed an appeal pending the outcome
   of Marinkovic.  He was unable to identify  that  case,  as  it  had  been
   anonymised.  There  would  be  no  prejudice  to  the  Respondent  in  an
   adjournment since the appellant would continue to have leave under s.3(c)
   of the Immigration Act  1971  until  the  appeal  was  determined.    The
   Tribunal notes that no such judgment has yet emanated from the  Court  of
   Appeal, despite the delay in finalising this determination.

30. If the Tribunal was against  him  on  the  adjournment  application,  Mr
   Wilford set out his IGS Transitional Arrangements argument, based on  the
   email chain. The appellant had received legal advice  from  her  previous
   legal representatives; he had no instructions as to whether  that  advice
   was erroneous.   Whether or not the appellant had been aware of the email
   chain, there was a clear ambiguity  between  that  and  the  Respondent's
   guidance. He asked the Tribunal to allow  the  appeal  and  substitute  a
   decision in the appellant's favour.

31. For the Secretary of State, Ms Kiss noted  that  the  witness  statement
   now produced was almost a  year  old,  and  was  at  best  muddled.   The
   appellant had not attended the hearing to clarify her evidence,  although
   she had been present at the first hearing of the appeal. The evidence  in
   relation to the appellant's former solicitors' actions and advice did not
   come close  to  the  standard  set  in  BT  (Former  solicitors'  alleged
   misconduct) Nepal [2004] UKIAT 00311 which held that where an  appeal  is
   based in whole or in part on allegations  about  the  conduct  of  former
   representatives, there must be evidence that those allegations have  been
   put to the former representative, and the Tribunal must be  shown  either
   the  response  or  correspondence  indicating  that  there  has  been  no
   response.  The appellant  should  not  be  permitted  to  rely  on  vague
   allegations of poor advice by previous representatives,  which  they  had
   not had an opportunity to comment upon. The Tribunal should  give  it  no
   weight.

32. Similarly, in relation to the email chain, there was  no  evidence  that
   the appellant knew of those emails, still less relied upon them.  It  was
   difficult on that basis to see how legitimate expectation could  be  made
   out.   The emails had no  relevance  to  the  present  appeal.  The  only
   matters which could potentially have influenced the  appellant's  conduct
   were the application form, the policy guidance then on the UKBA  website,
   and the Immigration Rules, all of which made it clear that �800 for three
   months was required.  The application form was  perfectly  clear  in  its
   reference to the policy guidance.  The appellant  completed  it,  stating
   that she had �800 and claiming the 10  points  for  Maintenance  (Funds).
   However inadequate the auto response text which  appeared  in  the  email
   chain until May 2009 (when it was reviewed and brought in line  with  the
   policy guidance) the appellant could not have been misled by  it  because
   she never saw it.

33. For those who did receive the auto response  emails,  the  Secretary  of
   State's case was that the application form still made it clear  that  all
   applicants should rely on  the  policy  guidance.   The  emails  produced
   referred to a  single  applicant  (not  this  appellant)  and  legitimate
   expectation required unambiguous reliance, which was  not  present  here.
   She adopted and relied upon paragraph 34 of SK. The  appellant's  witness
   statement had not been updated since May 2009 when the appeal  was  heard
   by the original Immigration Judge.

34. Replying, Mr Wilford said that it was  not  the  case  that  the  policy
   guidance was now part of the Immigration Rules and he  did  not  seek  to
   rely on it.  He sought instead to rely on the Tribunal's determination in
   an  unreported  decision,  IA/01396/2009.    The  Tribunal  reserved  its
   decision, which we now give.

Discussion

Procedural matters

35. We deal first with the  appellant's  adjournment  request.   It  appears
   from documents before us that there has been no  attempt  to  bring  this
   appellant's case up to date since May  2009.   She  did  not  attend  the
   hearing and her solicitors apparently have no  recent  instructions  from
   her.  Rule 21 of the Asylum and Immigration  Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
   2005 sets out when the Tribunal may adjourn an appeal, and was  the  rule
   in force on 5 January 2010:

   "21 Adjournment of appeals


    (1) Where a party applies for an adjournment of a hearing of an  appeal,
    he must-
      (a) if practicable, notify all other parties of the application;
      (b) show good reason why an adjournment is necessary; and
          (c) produce evidence of any fact or matter relied upon in  support
    of the application.


    (2) The Tribunal must  not  adjourn  a  hearing  of  an  appeal  on  the
    application  of  a  party,  unless  satisfied  that  the  appeal  cannot
    otherwise be justly determined.


    (3) The Tribunal must not, in  particular,  adjourn  a  hearing  on  the
    application of a party in order to allow the party more time to  produce
    evidence, unless satisfied that-
      (a) the evidence relates to a matter in dispute in the appeal;
      (b) it would be unjust to determine the appeal without permitting the
      party a further opportunity to produce the evidence; and
      (c) where the party has failed to  comply  with  directions  for  the
      production  of  the  evidence,  he  has   provided   a   satisfactory
      explanation for that failure. "

36. The present adjournment application was  not  on  notice.   It  did  not
   produce evidence of the solicitors' failure to advise correctly and there
   is no satisfactory explanation for the late application or the failure to
   provide supporting evidence.  We were not satisfied that the appeal could
   not be justly determined without the opportunity for further instructions
   to be taken from the appellant.  The  Tribunal  refused  to  adjourn  the
   hearing.

37.  The  appellant  included  in  her  bundle  a   number   of   unreported
   determinations and her Counsel sought  to  rely  on  one  of  them.   The
   Tribunal's guidance on unreported determinations at the date  of  hearing
   was set out in paragraph 17 of the AIT Practice Directions:
      "17. Reporting and citation of determinations...
      17.7 An application for permission to cite a determination which has
      not been reported must:

      (a) include a full transcript of the determination;
      (b) identify the proposition for which the determination is to be
      cited;
      (c) certify  that  the  proposition  is  not  found  in  any  reported
      determination of  the  Tribunal  or  of  the  IAT  and  has  not  been
      superseded by a decision of a higher authority; and
      (d) be accompanied by a summary analysis of all other decisions of the
      Tribunal and all available decisions of higher authority, relating  to
      the same issue, promulgated in the period beginning six months  before
      the date of the decision proposed to be cited  and  ending  two  weeks
      before the date of the hearing. (This analysis is intended to show the
      trend of Tribunal decisions on the issue)."

38. Nothing remotely like that was done  here.  The  appellant,  as  before,
   simply included in her  bundle  a  number  of  what  are  now  First-tier
   Tribunal determinations, the outcome of which she and her advisors  found
   satisfactory.  We have placed no weight on any unreported  determination.
   There is a fully reasoned reported determination in SK to assist us.

The substantive issues

39. Turning now to the substance of the appeal, the  questions  are,  first,
   whether in its analysis of the email chain in SK, the Tribunal  erred  in
   regarding those emails as disjunctive  rather than sequential; and if so,
   whether there existed an open ended 'transitional arrangement' the effect
   of which was that the appellant was not only entitled, as an IGS  holder,
   to 85 points for Attributes and English language ability because  of  her
   membership of that scheme, but also to the benefit  of  the  transitional
   arrangement whereby she need only show �800 in her account on a  date  in
   the month before the application was made.  Subsidiary arguments arose as
   to the status  of  the  Respondent's  policy  guidance  and  whether  the
   appellant had any legitimate expectation of being allowed  to  remain  in
   the United Kingdom.

40. Beginning with the email chain, we do not consider that it  avails  this
   appellant.  Its arrival in the hands of her solicitors (with  or  without
   the consent of the unnamed applicant  whose  emails  are  reproduced)  is
   rather mysterious.  The appellant did not rely  upon  the  auto  response
   herself because she never emailed the UKBA and so never received any auto
   response.  If she had, that might  be  another  matter,  but  that  would
   depend on the facts in such a case and we  are  not  seised  of  such  an
   appeal.

41. The remaining questions can be  taken  together.   In  a  nutshell,  the
   appellant argues that by reason of the language of the application  form,
   the policy guidance and or the email chain, she is not required to comply
   with the Maintenance (Funds) part of the Points-Based System and that, in
   this respect, SK was wrongly decided.  The same email  chain  was  before
   the Tribunal which heard SK.  That appellant was in the same position  as
   this appellant, in that the emails were not addressed to her and she  had
   not personally  suffered  any  misdirection  as  a  result  of  the  auto
   response.  The Tribunal considered the materials which are now before us,
   though without the multiple dated versions  of  the  online  information,
   application  form  and  policy  guidance  which  Ms  Kiss  had  helpfully
   retrieved from the UKBA computer system.

42. The application form expressly incorporated the policy  guidance,  which
   deals with Maintenance (Funds) under the heading "Maintenance requirement
   - all applications".  The policy guidance forms part of  the  application
   process and the appellant is directed on the form, in several places, and
   on the website, to read it before completing the  application.   That  is
   the status of the policy guidance.

43.  The  confusion  underlying  this  appellant's  argument  is  based,  we
   consider, in a conflation of two different transitional arrangements:

         a) The Maintenance (Funds) evidence arrangement which ended  on  31
            October 2008 allowed those who applied  under  the  new  Points-
            Based System (introduced on 29 February 2008) to  show  that  on
            the  closing  date  of  the  bank  statement  which  immediately
            preceded their application, they had in  that  account  �800  or
            such larger sum as was appropriate bearing in mind the number of
            their dependants, provided that the latest bank statement  ended
            within a month of the date of application.  That was a practical
            concession, given that the requirement to show �800  over  three
            months was entirely new and many students, not  having  expected
            it, would not have organised their finances in that way;

         b) The IGS and SEGS transitional arrangement  for  those  still  on
            those schemes after 30 June 2008 was an open ended one, allowing
            them to apply to transfer  to  Tier  1  (Post-Study  Work)   and
            crediting them with 75 points for Attributes and 10  points  for
            English language ability, by reason of their being part  of  the
            IGS scheme.  Both the IGS and SEGS schemes allowed  non-European
            graduates an additional year in the United Kingdom  working  and
            gaining valuable experience.  The  open  ended  nature  of  this
            second set of transitional arrangements  was  therefore  not  as
            generous as it appeared, since the  scheme  only  lasted  for  a
            year, but those who qualified and  met  the  other  requirements
            would be able to claim a further  year  as  Tier  1  (Post-Study
            Work) Migrants.  The Tier 1 (Post-Study Work) application  forms
            and guidance made it perfectly clear that IGS and  SEGS  holders
            were required to comply with Maintenance (Funds) (although  some
            of  them,  who  applied  before  31  October  2008,  might  have
            qualified for the Maintenance (Funds) transitional  arrangements
            also).

44. We consider it much more likely than not that an  educated,  intelligent
   person such as this appellant, reading the application form (which  gives
   her in effect 85 points for being on the IGS scheme, and  expressly  does
   not require that she prove her English language ability for 10 of  them),
   would understand that she still had to prove that she had  the  necessary
   funds available to her throughout the funding period.

45. The appellant's own evidence in her witness  statement,  made  not  long
   after refusal, is, as Ms Kiss contended, less than convincing as  to  her
   having misunderstood such requirement.   First,  without  any  supporting
   evidence, she blames her lawyers for poor advice.   Second,  she  asserts
   that her  understanding  of  the  requirement  was  one  or  all  of  the
   following:

     . That the Transitional Arrangements would be applied and she did  not
       need to meet any points requirements; or

     . That she only had to demonstrate �800 in her account at the  end  of
       each month; or

     . That she only had to demonstrate �800 in her account on the date  of
       her Points-Based System application.

46. If the appellant had misunderstood or been misled, then  at  that  date,
   just a few months after her application, we consider that she would  have
   known which one of those three rather different arguments she  wanted  to
   make.  The use of all three does not indicate to us that she really  held
   any such conviction.

47. We turn to SK for assistance with the legitimate expectation point:

    "34.   Of particular clarity and brevity  as  to  the  approach  to  be
    adopted in assessing this concept is the guidance offered by  Schiemann
    LJ in R v Newham Borough Council ex parte Bibi [2003] 1 WLR  237  where
    he states as follows.

      "In  all  legitimate  expectation  cases,  whether   substantive   or
      procedural, three practical questions arise. The first question is to
      what has the  public  authority,  whether  by  practice  or  promise,
      committed itself; the second is whether the authority  has  acted  or
      proposes to act unlawfully in relation to its commitment;  the  third
      is what the court should do."

    35.    Applying these principles I  conclude,  for  the  reasons  given
    above, first that the Respondent has, neither by practice nor  promise,
    ever  committed  himself  to  extending  the  transitional  arrangement
    relating to maintenance beyond 31 October 2008. I have not found within
    the documents supplied to me any evidence  that  he  has  expressly  or
    impliedly given a contrary impression. I have no reason to suppose that
    the reply given by Ms Bennett of UKBA in her e-mail of 3 December  2008
    was not the standard response given by UKBA to anyone  inquiring  about
    the transitional arrangement on maintenance. It follows therefore  that
    I also conclude  that  the  Respondent  has  not  acted  unlawfully  in
    relation to his commitments on the subject. Thus there is no basis  for
    the Tribunal to intervene on the basis of legitimate expectation, again
    notwithstanding the contrary submissions made by Ms Laughton."

48. Applying the SK principles to these facts, which  are  almost  identical
   save for the appellant's own rather  confused  evidence  of  her  claimed
   misunderstanding  of  the   various  Points-Based   System   transitional
   arrangements, we also are satisfied  that  the  Respondent  did  not,  by
   practice or promise, commit himself to extending the Maintenance  (Funds)
   transitional arrangement beyond 31 October 2008.  We bear  in  mind  that
   the appellant herself gives three different versions of her understanding
   and we consider that had the Secretary of State  committed  himself,  she
   would have been able to identify the practice or promise to which he  was
   committed with far greater certainty.

49. The fundamental point here is that the appellant has conflated two  sets
   of  transitional  provisions.   It  is  right   that   the   transitional
   arrangements for IGS holders continued up to and including  the  date  of
   the  appellant's  application  to  the  Respondent.   Those  transitional
   arrangements are very clearly set out in the application form and in  the
   policy guidance and they are, that IGS holders will be  given  75  points
   for attributes and 10 points for English language ability merely  because
   they are already on the IGS scheme, as long as their IGS did  not  expire
   before 30 June 2008, which this appellant's did not.

50. The transitional  arrangement  at  the  beginning  of  the  Points-Based
   System in relation to the �800  Maintenance  (Funds)  requirement  was  a
   different one. Until 31 October 2008, an appellant only had to show  that
   at the statement date of her last bank statement before the  application,
   she had a figure in excess of �800 in her account.  The reason  was  that
   the three month requirement caused a retrospective difficulty  for  those
   already in the country and it was considered appropriate to make the test
   rather easier for a short period while news of  the  Points-Based  System
   and its requirements settled in.  The appellant applied after 31  October
   2008 and nothing in the voluminous material before the Tribunal indicates
   that the Respondent extended this part of the  transitional  arrangements
   for the benefit of all IGS holders applying for Tier 1 (Post-Study  Work)
   status after 31 October 2008.

51. For all  of  the  above  reasons,  we  uphold  the  Immigration  Judge's
   determination.

DECISION

52. For the foregoing reasons, our decision is as follows:   The  making  of
   the previous decision involved the making of no error on a point of law.
