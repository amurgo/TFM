                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS




     1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against a determination
        of a panel  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  composed  of  First-tier
        Tribunal Judge Fisher and Mr A E Armitage (hereinafter referred  to
        as 'the Panel'), promulgated on 9th December 2013,  in  which  they
        allow Mr Rasul's appeal against an order for his  deportation  from
        the United Kingdom made pursuant  to  section  32  (5)  of  the  UK
        Borders Act 2007 to the limited  extent  that  the  matter  remains
        outstanding before the Secretary of  State  to  decide  whether  Mr
        Rasul falls within exception one of section 33 of  the  UK  Borders
        Act in light of their conclusion that  he  is  an  extended  family
        member of an EEA national exercising Treaty rights  in  the  United
        Kingdom.



Background


     2. Mr Rasul is a citizen of Iraq who has  provided  various  dates  of
        birth such as 25th January 1977 and 25th January 1982. He claims to
        have arrived in the United Kingdom on 26th August 2003 and  applied
        for asylum two days later although fingerprint checks revealed that
        he had, in fact, claimed asylum in Germany on 25th March 2003 in  a
        different name. His asylum claim was  certified  on  third  country
        grounds  and  removal  directions  set  to  Germany   although   he
        absconded.


     3. Mr Raul was next encountered on 9th June 2009 when he was  arrested
        in a factory in Northallerton on suspicion of fraud.  He had worked
        since October 2004 using a false identity of an individual who  had
        left the United Kingdom in that year using a travel document issued
        by the Home Office  after  he  was  granted  exceptional  leave  to
        remain.   Mr  Rasul  admitted  that  he  purchased   that   persons
        documents, including a National Insurance number, for ï¿½700 and used
        the  exceptional  leave  to  remain  letter  in  order  to   obtain
        indefinite leave to remain in this person's identity.


     4. On 26th August 2009 Mr Rasul married a  citizen  of  Latvia  in  an
        Islamic ceremony in the UK in which  he  claims  he  used  his  own
        correct identity.  On  4th  September  2009  he  was  convicted  at
        Teesside Crown Court for offences of deception, for  which  he  was
        sentenced  to  12  months  imprisonment  on  each  count   to   run
        concurrently, and notified of his liability  for  deportation.   He
        claims to have a  fear  of  returning  to  Iraq  and  that  he  has
        established family life in the United  Kingdom.   On  8th  February
        2011 he lodged an application for a  certificate  of  approval  for
        marriage which was rejected because there was no evidence to  prove
        that his partner was free  to  marry.  The  deportation  order  was
        signed on 17th September 2013.


     5. The Panel set out the evidence they received and considered in some
        detail before arriving at their findings from paragraph 22  of  the
        determination. In relation to his claim to  face  a  real  risk  of
        persecution if returned to Iraq the Panel conclude that as a result
        of discrepancies and inconsistencies in his  evidence,  highlighted
        in paragraph  23  and  24  of  the  determination,  they  were  not
        satisfied that Mr Raul's account was reasonably likely to  be  true
        as a result of which they dismissed it in its entirety.  The  Panel
        did not accept that his removal pursuant to the  deportation  order
        would breach the U.K.'s obligations under the Refugee Convention or
        Articles 2 or 3 ECHR [25].


     6. In relation to the assertion  that  he  fell  within  an  exemption
        contained in the UK Borders Act 2007 based  upon  his  relationship
        with an EEA national,  it  was  accepted  his  partner  is  an  EEA
        national but it was not accepted that she  is  a  qualified  person
        under the 2006 Regulations  because  she  is  not  a  jobseeker,  a
        worker, a self-employed person,  a  self-sufficient  person,  or  a
        student [26].


     7. In her witness statement the partner stated that she cares for  her
        son as a result of which it was found she has a  derived  right  of
        residence as her son's carer [26].  Mr Rasul and  his  partner  are
        not married and so he does not fall  within  the  definition  of  a
        family member and it was not accepted by  the  Secretary  of  State
        that they are in a relationship akin to marriage.


     8. The Panel accepted the evidence that Mr Rasul and his partner  have
        been cohabiting since 2008 and that she was expecting his child  in
        January 2014. They concluded that the  parties  are  in  a  durable
        relationship under  Regulation  8  (5)  of  the  2006  Regulations,
        although having considered the decision of the  Upper  Tribunal  in
        Rose (automatic deportation -  exception  3)  Jamaica  [2011]  UKUT
        00276 they noted that the  same  issue  arose  in  this  appeal  in
        relation to whether a person in respect of  whom  a  discretion  to
        issue a residence card under regulation 17 (4) may be exercised can
        be found to be so entitled at the  appeal  stage  and  accepted  it
        cannot and that the case must be remitted to the Secretary of State
        for  her  to  consider  whether  she  wished  to  exercise  such  a
        discretion  in  Mr  Rasul's  favour.  The  Panel  found   that   as
        consideration had not been  given  to  the  exercise  of  any  such
        discretion the assessment of the criteria relevant  to  deportation
        or  removal  cannot  be  completed  and  that  it  must  be  found,
        therefore, that the decision is not in  accordance  with  the  law.
        Accordingly the Panel concluded, following the  decision  in  Rose,
        that they must allow the appeal  to  the  extent  that  the  matter
        remains outstanding for the Secretary of State to decide whether Mr
        Rasul falls within exception one in the light of  their  conclusion
        that he is an extended family member [27].


     9. The Panel did not finalise their conclusions  in  relation  to  the
        family and private life considerations stating  that  a  favourable
        exercise of discretion under Regulation  17  (4)  would  enable  Mr
        Rasul to benefit from exception one in section 33 of the UK Borders
        Act and so any further consideration would  be  premature  at  this
        stage [28].



Error of law


    10. Regulation 17 (4) provides:


              (4)      The Secretary of State may issue a residence card  to
   an extended                  family member not falling within  regulation
   7(3) who is not an EEA                national on application if-


                  (a)  the relevant EEA national in relation to the extended
   family                       member is  a  qualified  person  or  an  EEA
   national with a                           permanent  right  of  residence
   under regulation 15; and


                  (b)  in all the circumstances it appears to the  Secretary
   of State                         appropriate to issue the residence card.


    11. The Secretary of State's challenge is based  upon  the  requirement
        for the EEA national to be a qualified person or a  person  with  a
        permanent right of residence under Regulation 15 which it is stated
        is a condition that has not been satisfied by Mr Rasul's partner.


    12. The Panel find that the partner is not a qualified person and  that
        she only has a derived right of residence as the carer of her  son.
        She does not have a permanent right of residence and on the face of
        it cannot satisfy the relevant condition contained in Regulation 17
        (4) (a).


    13. Whether an individual who has a derived right of residence is  able
        to acquire  a  right  to  permanent  residence  is  dealt  with  in
        Regulation 15 (1A) which states :


          [(1A) Residence in the United Kingdom as a result of a  derivative
   right of            residence  does  not  constitute  residence  for  the
   purpose of this regulation.


    14. The argument that Mr Rasul's  partner  has  a  permanent  right  of
        residence as the need to care for her child is a permanent state of
        affairs, does not mean that she is entitled to a right of permanent
        residence under regulation 15 which denotes a legal rather  than  a
        practical status.


    15. Regulation 15A, which relates to Derivative  rights  of  residence,
        states:


          (1)     A person ("P") who is not [an exempt  person]  2  and  who
   satisfies the                criteria in paragraph (2), (3), (4) [, (4A)]
   3 or (5) of this regulation is entitled            to a derivative  right
   to reside in the United Kingdom for as long as P                satisfies
   the relevant criteria.


    16. The Regulation confers  no  further  right  beyond  that  which  is
        derived from the qualifying situation/criteria.


    17. Regulation 15 (1A) is to be found in the version of the Regulations
        that came into force as from the 1st January 2014, before the  date
        of the hearing, but the principle can be seen to  be  in  force  in
        earlier decisions  in  European  cases  law.  In  Bee  and  another
        (permanent/derived rights of residence) [2013] UKUT 83 (IAC) (Blake
        J) the Tribunal held that a non-EU citizen, who is residing in  the
        United Kingdom by reason of a derived right of residence (eg as the
        primary carer of an EU citizen child),  cannot  thereby  acquire  a
        permanent right of residence in this country.


    18. In Alarape and Tijani v SSHD (case C- 529/11) CJEU (Second Chamber)
        8th May 2013 it was held there were two ways for family members  of
        a Union Citizen who were not nationals of a Member State to acquire
        a right of permanent residence under the Citizens Directive. First,
        under Article 16(2)  of  the  Citizens  Directive,  family  members
        acquired the right of permanent residence if they  legally  resided
        for a period of five years with a Union  Citizen  who  was  legally
        resident for a continuous period of five years. Secondly,  Articles
        12(2), 13(2)
         and 18 of the Citizens Directive  together  defined  the  right  of
permanent              residence for  family  members  where  residence  was
retained in the event of        death or divorce. Legal residence for a  set
period of time was again a                    requirement.  Legal  residence
meant a period of residence which complied with        the  conditions  laid
down   in   Article    7(1)    of    the    Citizens    Directive    itself:
Ziolkowski and Szeja v Land Berlin (Cases C-424/10 and C-425/10) applied.  A
         period of residence which complied with the law of a  Member  State
but did
         not  satisfy  the  conditions  in  Article  7(1)  of  the  Citizens
Directive was not               regarded as  legal  residence.  It  followed
that for the purposes of acquiring a         right  of  permanent  residence
for family members of a Union citizen who were         not  nationals  of  a
Member State, only the  periods  of  residence  which  satisfied         the
conditions in the Citizens Directive were to be taken into consideration.
         Periods of residence solely on the  basis  of  Article  12  of  the
Regulations were not       considered (paras 33 - 40 and 48).


    19. Regulation 15 (1A) therefore reflects the law to be  found  in  the
        Citizens Directive and reflects an applicable principle in force at
        the date of the hearing before the Panel.


    20. I find that in allowing the appeal for the stated reasons the Panel
        has made a material error of law. I  set  the  determination  aside
        although the findings in relation to the inability of Mr  Rasul  to
        succeed and any of the  protection  provisions  together  with  his
        immigration and history of criminal behaviour  shall  be  preserved
        findings.


Discussion



    21. In re-making the decision I find that Mr Rasul is unable to succeed
        under the EEA Regulations as he has  not  established  that  he  is
        entitled to any right of residence under EEA law and/or any of  the
        provisions of the 2006 Regulations as amended. I dismiss this  head
        of claim and find that he has not substantiated  his  claim  to  be
        entitled to benefit from exemption one of the UK Borders Act 2007.


    22. As the Panel did not consider Mr Rasul's human rights  claim  based
        on family and/or private life it was agreed  that  the  appropriate
        disposal of this appeal is to remit the matter  to  the  Panel  for
        them to consider this element, in relation to which  the  following
        directions shall apply:


              i.  The appeal shall be remitted to  the  First-tier  Tribunal
   sitting at North                 Shields to enable the original Panel  of
   Judge Fisher and Mr A E                       Armitage to complete  their
   deliberation of the outstanding issue.                  Time  estimate  2
   hours.


              ii. The scope of the hearing shall be limited  to  considering
   the family                   and private life elements of the claim which
   must be conducted in                  accordance with the guidance to  be
   found in the cases of MF                      (Nigeria) [2013]  EWCA  Civ
   1192, the High Court in Nagre [2013]               EWHC 720  (Admin)  and
   by the Upper Tribunal  in  Gulshan  [2013]                 UKUT  640,  as
   confirmed by Shahzad (Art 8: legitimate aim) [2014]                  UKUT
   00085  (IAC).   These   judgments   have   made   it   clear   that   the
   question of proportionality must be looked  at  in  the  context  of  the
     Immigration Rules with no need  to  go  on  to  a  specific  assessment
     under Article 8 if it is  clear  from  the  facts  that  there  are  no
   particular                    compelling  or  exceptional   circumstances
   requiring that course to be               taken. This approach  has  been
   further confirmed by the Court of                   Appeal  in  the  more
   recent case of Haleemundeen v SSHD [2014]                   EWCA Civ 558.


              iii.     The hearing is to be listed taking into  account  the
   availability of the                   Panel and Miss  Weatherall  for  Mr
   Rasul. Mrs. Rackstraw is to be                consulted to ensure she  is
   able to allocate a suitably experienced                presenting officer
   to the hearing.


              iv. No later than 14 days before the  hearing  Mr  Rasul  must
   file a                       consolidated, indexed and  paginated  bundle
   containing all the                    evidence upon which he  intends  to
   rely. Witness statements shall                stand as  the  evidence  in
   chief of the maker.  A  skeleton  argument                 must  also  be
   enclosed.   Evidence   not   filed   within   this   time   scale    will
   not  be  admitted  without  leave  for  which  an  application  must   be
   made in writing and     accompanied by  a  detailed  statement  from  the
          solicitor with conduct of the case confirming the reasons for  the
                  failure, where  responsibility  for  the  same  lies,  the
   nature of the                    evidence it is  sought  to  adduce,  the
   relevance of that evidence to the                  issues in  the  appeal
   and evidence of any prejudice  to  either  party  if                 that
   evidence is or is not admitted.


              v.  No later than 14 days from receipt  of  this  document  Mr
   Rasul's                      solicitors must contact the listing  officer
   at North Shields to                       confirm whether an  interpreter
   is required and, if so, in what                    language(s).



Decision

    23. The First-tier Tribunal Panel materially erred in law. I set  aside
        the decision of the original Judge. I dismiss the appeal under  the
        EEA Regulations.  The  outstanding  human  rights  claim  shall  be
        remitted to  the  original  Panel  in  accordance  with  the  above
        directions.


   Anonymity.


    24. The First-tier Tribunal did not make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
        45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
        2005. I make no such order.
