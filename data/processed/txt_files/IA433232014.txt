For the claimant: Ms E Norman, instructed by Bhogal & Co Solicitors
For the respondent:    Ms C Johnstone, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Secretary of State  appeals  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge  Cox  promulgated  19.1.15,  dismissing  on  immigration
    grounds but allowing on human rights  grounds,  the  claimant's  appeal
    against the decision of the Secretary  of  State,  dated  15.10.14,  to
    refuse his application for leave to remain in the UK as the spouse of a
    person present and settled in the UK.  The Judge heard  the  appeal  on
    7.1.15.

 2. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Parkes  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    26.2.15.

 3. Thus the matter came before me on 6.4.16 as  an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 4. At the hearing before me I found no material error of law in the making
    of the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  such  as  to  require  the
    decision of Judge Cox to be set aside. Having announced my decision  at
    the hearing, I now give my reasons.

 5. The claimant entered the UK as spouse in  2010  with  leave  to  remain
    until January 2013. The  application  was  refused  under  Appendix  FM
    because his application was made after he had overstayed more  than  28
    days and thus could not meet the eligibility requirements  of  Appendix
    FM and he did not meet the requirements of EX1 to  show  insurmountable
    obstacles to continuing family life with his partner outside the UK. He
    also failed to demonstrate that there were very  significant  obstacles
    to integration in Pakistan.

 6. Judge Cox found that the appellant could not meet  the  Rules,  and  in
    particular that there were no insurmountable obstacles to  family  life
    in Pakistan. However, the judge went on to conduct an  article  8  ECHR
    Razgar stepped assessment and reached the conclusion that the  decision
    was disproportionate.

 7. In  summary,  the  grounds  of  appeal  point  to  the  finding  of  no
    insurmountable obstacles and complain that the judge failed to identify
    any compelling circumstances insufficiently recognised under the  Rules
    to justify granting leave to remain on the basis of article 8 ECHR. "It
    is respectfully submitted that the learned judge having found that  the
    appellant cannot meet the article 8 ECHR compliant rules, has taken the
    same facts and reasoning and allowed the appeal having failed to direct
    himself properly, and failed to give any adequate reasons for so doing.
    This is submitted to be clearly wrong in law."

 8. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Parkes observed, "The  decision
    makes no reference to either Gulshan or Nagre and it is not clear  what
    it is about their circumstances  that  are  not  adequately  considered
    within the Rules. On that basis the grounds are arguable and permission
    to appeal is granted."

 9.  I  find  that  at  ï¿½81  the  judge  was  referencing  the   compelling
    circumstances test, and found that in this particular case the Rules do
    not provide a complete code "in the circumstances I  find  exist."  The
    judge then went  on  to  make  a  reasoned  article  8  proportionality
    assessment, stating that it was a finely balanced matter.

10. Ms Norman pointed out that this is not a case of person coming  to  the
    UK on an entirely temporary basis and  then  seeking  to  remain  on  a
    different basis. The claimant was married in 2008 and came to the UK as
    a spouse in 2010, with leave limited in the usual way, to January 2013.
    The relationship was thus  not  entered  into  in  the  UK  whilst  his
    immigration  status  was  unlawful  or  precarious.  He  came  with   a
    legitimate expectation of settlement once the probationary  period  had
    been completed. His family life was not precarious. Ms  Norman  submits
    that this distinguishes this case from the Nagre situation. His wife is
    a British citizen and his child is also a British citizen.

11. Unfortunately it was only after his  leave  expired  that  he  made  an
    application in March 2013 for further leave  to  remain  as  a  spouse,
    refused in May 2013, with no right of appeal. In January  2014  he  was
    served with a liability to removal notice. The claimant's case was that
    the delay in making the application was the fault of his solicitors; it
    does not appear that this was challenged.

12. In essence, the appellant  finds  himself  in  difficulty  because  his
    application to vary leave  to  remain  made  in  March  2013  was  made
    approximately 6 weeks after expiry of his leave.

13. On 23.4.14 the appellant submitted a human rights  application  on  the
    basis of article 8 ECHR, refused on 15.7.14 with  a  right  of  appeal.
    After lodging his appeal,  in  October  2014  the  Secretary  of  State
    withdrew the refusal decision  of  April  2014.  The  remaking  of  the
    decision on 15.10.14 and the subsequent appeal against the  refusal  is
    the subject matter of this appeal.

14. There are some difficulties with the refusal decision and its reasoning
    is hard to follow. It was submitted to the First-tier Tribunal that  it
    was the result of a 'cut and paste' exercise with the consequence  that
    there  are  inconsistent  statements.  For  example,  even  though  the
    relationship between the appellant and  his  British  citizen  wife  is
    accepted to be genuine and subsisting, the decision states that  family
    and private life does not specifically engage article 8 ECHR.

15. The circumstances above are capable of being  found  to  be  compelling
    circumstances insufficiently recognised in the Immigration Rules, so as
    to justify the First-tier Tribunal Judge going on to make his article 8
    ECHR private and family life assessment. Whilst the layout and  content
    of the First-tier Tribunal decision could have been clearer,  I  cannot
    find that the decision to conduct  the  article  8  assessment  or  the
    finding  that  the   decision   of   the   Secretary   of   State   was
    disproportionate, to  be  either  perverse  or  irrational.  The  judge
    carefully  considered  all  the  evidence  and  reached   a   perfectly
    reasonable and reasoned conclusion.

16. This was the only ground of appeal. In the  circumstances,  I  find  no
    material error of law and the appeal of the  Secretary  of  State  must
    fail.

Conclusions:

17. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should
    be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains allowed on human rights grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal was brought by the  Secretary  of  State  and  has  been
dismissed.
