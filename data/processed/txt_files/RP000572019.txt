                            DECISION AND REASONS
Anonymity order

Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008
(SI 2008/269) The Tribunal has ORDERED that no one shall publish  or  reveal
the name or address of N N who  is  the  subject  of  these  proceedings  or
publish or reveal any information which would  be  likely  to  lead  to  the
identification of him or of any member of  his  family  in  connection  with
these proceedings.

Any failure to comply with this direction could give  rise  to  contempt  of
court proceedings.

Decision and reasons

 1. The Secretary of State appeals with permission from the decision of the
    First-tier Tribunal allowing the claimant's appeal against her decision
    on 15 May 2021 to revoke the claimant's protected refugee  status  with
    reference to Articles 1F(c) and 33(2) of the Refugee  Convention  1951,
    and paragraph 339AC of the  Immigration  Rules  HC  395  (as  amended),
    following his conviction on 4  April  2019  for  offences  contrary  to
    section 25A of the Immigration Act 1971. The claimant is a  citizen  of
    Iran.

 2. On 19 February 2019, the Secretary  of  State  wrote  to  the  claimant
    notifying him that revocation of refugee status was  being  considered,
    with reference to section 72 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum
    Act 2002 (as amended).   The claimant did not respond.

 3. On 15 May 2019 the Secretary of State decided to revoke the  claimant's
    refugee  status.   She  recorded  at  [37]  of  that  letter  that  the
    claimant's indefinite leave to remain was unaffected and 'as such there
    is no negative impact on your family or private life  as  a  result  of
    this revocation decision' but that his indefinite leave to remain might
    be subject to future review.

 4. On 11 September 2019, the claimant was served with a deportation  order
    with reference to section 32 of the UK Borders Act 2007, and invited to
    make submissions in response to a One-Stop Notice.  That order had  the
    effect of terminating the claimant's indefinite leave  to  remain,  but
    not that of his two former wives or the child of his  second  marriage,
    with whom the claimant is not  permitted  any  kind  of  contact.   The
    claimant's current partner is a British citizen with two adult sons  in
    their 30s.  There are therefore no relevant minor children.

 5. Mode of hearing.  The hearing today took place  remotely  by  Microsoft
    Teams.  There were no technical difficulties.  I am satisfied that  all
    parties were in a quiet and private place  and  that  the  hearing  was
    completed fairly, with the cooperation of both representatives.

Background

 6. The claimant's history in Iran is set out in  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    decision.  The claimant married his  first,  Ukrainian  wife  in  April
    2001, having met her  in  Iran,  where  she  had  come  as  a  visitor,
    accompanying her mother, a designer working for the Iranian government.
     The couple's common language  was  German,  and  the  claimant's  wife
    converted to Islam in order to marry him.

 7. The couple paid a people smuggler just over $10,000 to  bring  them  to
    the United Kingdom, arriving on 9 November 2001.  They claimed  asylum.
    On 6 June 2003, the claimant was granted indefinite  leave  to  remain,
    following refugee recognition as the  spouse  of  his  Ukrainian  wife.
    The marriage failed and was dissolved in 2003.

 8. The claimant remarried, and with his second wife, he had a son, to whom
    he has no access.  The couple separated in 2004 and that  marriage  was
    dissolved in 2009.

 9. In 2004 or 2005, the claimant met his present long term partner.    She
    had two adult sons, both in their 30s and  not  living  at  home.   The
    claimant told the First-tier Tribunal that he is 'close' to those  men.
    He also has a nephew, who lives in the United Kingdom  with  his  wife:
    they have had nothing to do with the claimant since his imprisonment.

10. On 17 February 2017, the claimant was  granted  settlement  and  issued
    with a United Kingdom passport. In 2017, the claimant's younger brother
    died in  Iran.   The  claimant  thinks  that  the  Iranian  authorities
    poisoned his brother.

11. In the same year, the claimant says  he  received  anonymous  telephone
    calls requiring him to help organise a high price  service  for  middle
    class Iranians, providing flights, documents and handlers to  accompany
    them to travel to the United Kingdom on  identity  documents  to  which
    they were not entitled, and on arrival to claim  asylum  in  their  own
    names.

12. The claimant told the First-tier Judge that, contrary to  the  findings
    set out in the sentencing judge's remarks, he  only  received  expenses
    for his involvement in the people trafficking conspiracy  and  made  no
    profit.  He did not intend to become involved again in such activities,
    even if there were threats to his family members again.  He had learned
    his lesson and was remorseful.

13. The sentencing judge found that even if the initial impetus  came  from
    corrupt Iranian officials, the claimant and another Greek man had  gone
    into independent, and very profitable, business for themselves and were
    not working under duress at the time  of  the  index  offences.  People
    trafficking was a profitable business as each  traveller  paid  between
    �8000 and �12000 to avoid the normal immigration restrictions.  Not all
    of that fee was profit in the claimant's  hands:  he  had  expenses  in
    providing this service to his clients.

14. The claimant pleaded guilty to a charge of facilitating asylum  seekers
    into the United Kingdom for  gain,  contrary  to  section  25A  of  the
    Immigration Act 1971. The sentencing judge found the claimant's service
    to be 'well-planned, organised and sophisticated' and that he was in  a
    leading role in the conspiracy.

15. On 16 August  2019,  he  was  sentenced  to  45  months'  imprisonment,
    triggering the section 72(2) presumption that he has been convicted  of
    a particularly serious crime and is a danger to the  community  of  the
    United Kingdom.

First-tier Tribunal decision

16. The claimant appealed the May 2021 revocation decision  to  the  First-
    tier Tribunal, which allowed his appeal, principally because the First-
    tier Judge found that his  offence  was  not  a  'particularly  serious
    crime'  for  the  purposes  of  Article  33(2)  and  the   section   72
    presumptions.





Error of law decision

17. On 26 April 2021, I set aside the First-tier Tribunal's decision.   The
    decision in this appeal now falls to be remade in the  Upper  Tribunal.



18. The issue for the Tribunal is  whether  the  appellant  can  rebut  the
    presumption in section 72 of the Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum
    Act 2002 (as amended).

Appellant's statement

19. The claimant relied on his witness statement of 11 November 2019, which
    set out his family history in Iran: his father and his middle  brothers
    were executed in 2001, for which the appellant had to pay the  cost  to
    the state, and his younger brother was said to have  been  poisoned  by
    the Iranian authorities in 2017.   There was no  updated  statement  or
    oral evidence from the claimant.

20. The November 2019 statement set out  the  torture  and  harassment  the
    claimant experienced in Iran before leaving.  He said he  had  suffered
    severe depression for 5 years between  2004  and  2009,  for  which  he
    received treatment.  He has severe  arthritis  which  required  a  knee
    operation.  He had asthma and diabetes, for which he needs medication.

21. In the Austrian prison, the claimant took cooking classes  and  learned
    German.   He says he has deep remorse for his previous acts, and became
    involved only reluctantly, 'at a time that I was experiencing difficult
    problems in [my] life'.

OASys report: 7 February 2020

22. The claimant also produced a pre-discharge OASys assessment carried out
    on 7 February 2020 at HMP Maidstone, which was  not  available  to  the
    First-tier Judge.  The OASys report sets out the history of  the  index
    offence, noting that the conspiracy as charged covered 31 May 2017 - 30
    September 2017, but that there was evidence of other transactions  from
    28 May 2017 - 18 October 2017 when  the  claimant  and  his  Greek  co-
    conspirator  were  arrested  in  Austria  for  similar  offences,   and
    imprisoned there for two years, before being returned with  the  mobile
    phone evidence and prosecuted again in the United Kingdom.

23. In Iran, the claimant said he had a happy childhood, being  brought  up
    by both parents, but his father was killed by the  Revolutionary  Guard
    in 2001, his mother dying 40 days later.  The claimant had four sisters
    and  five  brothers,  but  one  brother  was  killed  in  2017  by  the
    Revolutionary Guard.  In Iran, he worked in his family carpet  business
    and family restaurant.  The claimant is an educated man who studied for
    a degree in History while in Iran, and is fluent  in  English,  German,
    Japanese and Farsi.   When released from prison, the claimant hoped  to
    return to Newcastle, where his current partner lives, and  rejoin  her.
    He had previously worked in Newcastle as a pizza chef but hoped now  to
    use his many contacts to get a job as a head chef.

24. The claimant's account to the interviewing officer was that he had been
    forced to undertake this work by members of the  Iranian  Revolutionary
    Guard,  who  visited  him  in  Newcastle,  where  he  was  living,  and
    threatened  to  kill  his  brother  if  he  did  not  cooperate.    The
    interviewing officer did not accept that account  and  considered  that
    the claimant's main motivation was financial gain.

25. Under Criminogenic  Needs  Summary  and  Section  Scores,  the  matters
    considered to be linked to risk of  reoffending  were  ETE  (Education,
    Training and Employment), Finance, Lifestyle and  Associates,  Thinking
    and Behaviour, and Attitudes.  Of these, only  Education  Training  and
    Employment was considered to be a risk  for  reoffending  and  to  need
    attention.  The appellant was considered to present a  low  probability
    of re-offending (15% over two years, 12% for violent  offences  and  7%
    for non-violent offending).

26. The  claimant's  prison  behaviour  had  been  good,  with  a  positive
    attitude, no evidence of offence-paralleling behaviour and  maintaining
    prison employment.   A number of awareness programmes were  recommended
    for completion before release.   Non-completion  of  those  programmes,
    lack of or no employment, non-compliance with  licence  conditions  and
    restrictions, or evidence of offence-related behaviour were  considered
    to be factors which might inhibit lasting change.

27. The claimant was working on an increased awareness of his  own  actions
    and their impact on others, improvement  of  employment-related  skills
    and the ability to work in a team.  Work on increased budgeting  skills
    had not started.

Submissions

28. For the Secretary of State, I have  reviewed  the  written  submissions
    received on 12 January 2021 for the error of law hearing.  They do  not
    assist me with the factual finding whether the  claimant  has  rebutted
    the section 72 presumption.

29. In oral submissions, Mr Tufan reminded me that it was now  accepted  by
    Mr Sharma that the claimant had committed a particularly serious  crime
    in the United Kingdom.   The Austrian offence also engaged the  section
    72 presumption.  The sentences imposed,  2  years  in  Austria  and  45
    months  in  the  United  Kingdom,  reflected  the  seriousness  of  the
    offences.  Mr Tufan agreed that rebuttal of the section 72  presumption
    was a question of fact, but relied on  MA  (Pakistan)  v  Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department [2014] EWCA Civ 163 (05 February 2014).

30. The claimant had not been found to be a credible witness by the  First-
    tier Judge:  despite  the  findings  on  his  criminal  conviction,  he
    continued to assert  that  he  had  made  no  profit  from  his  people
    smuggling conspiracy.  The  claimant  was  not  rehabilitated  and  any
    remorse expressed could carry  no  weight  in  circumstances  where  he
    continued to maintain that the offence to which he pleaded  guilty  was
    not as the sentencing judge had found it to be.  Removal of  protection
    should be upheld.

31.  The  claimant's  Counsel,  Ms  Miranda  Butler,  provided  a   written
    submission for the hearing on 28 January 2021.  The  claimant  accepted
    that whether or not it was argued, the Upper Tribunal  had  a  duty  to
    consider the statutory presumptions in section  72  of  the  2002  Act.
    The claimant had been convicted of an offence and sentenced to a period
    of imprisonment in excess of  2  years:   the  Tribunal  was  therefore
    obliged in law to consider section 72, but Ms Butler argued that on the
    evidence before the First-tier Tribunal, the claimant had rebutted  the
    presumption.

32. In oral submissions for the claimant at the remaking hearing, Mr Sharma
    took me through the OASys report.   He  too  accepted  that  the  index
    offences, and by implication also the Austrian  offences,  engaged  the
    section 72 presumptions. The claimant had pleaded guilty to the  United
    Kingdom offences, although he continued to  assert  that  he  committed
    them under duress (which would have been a defence, had he advanced  it
    successfully in the criminal proceedings).

33. Mr Sharma said that the question whether the  section  72  presumptions
    had been rebutted was a question of fact for the Upper Tribunal on  the
    evidence before me.  No legal  argument  was  necessary  and  none  was
    offered to assist the Tribunal in deciding whether the presumption  had
    been rebutted.

Analysis

34. Article 33(2) of the Refugee Convention provides that:

         "Article 33 - PROHIBITION OF EXPULSION OR RETURN ("REFOULEMENT")

         1. No Contracting  State  shall  expel  or  return  ("refouler")  a
            refugee in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories
            where his life or freedom would be threatened on account of  his
            race, religion, nationality, membership of a  particular  social
            group or political opinion.

         2. The benefit of  the  present  provision  may  not,  however,  be
            claimed by a refugee  whom  there  are  reasonable  grounds  for
            regarding as a danger to the security of the country in which he
            is, or who, having been convicted  by  a  final  judgment  of  a
            particularly  serious  crime,  constitutes  a  danger   to   the
            community of that country."

35. Section 72, so far as relevant, provides that:


         "72  Serious criminal

         (1)  This section applies for the purpose of the  construction  and
         application of Article 33(2) of the Refugee  Convention  (exclusion
         from protection).


         (2)  A person shall be presumed to have been convicted by  a  final
         judgment of a particularly serious crime and to constitute a danger
         to the community of the United Kingdom if he is-
             (a)  convicted in the United Kingdom of an offence, and
             (b)  sentenced to a period of imprisonment  of  at  least  two
             years.


         (3)  A person shall be presumed to have been convicted by  a  final
         judgment of a particularly serious crime and to constitute a danger
         to the community of the United Kingdom if-
             (a)  he is convicted outside the United Kingdom of an offence,
             (b)  he is sentenced to a period of imprisonment of  at  least
             two years, and
             (c)  he could have been sentenced to a period of  imprisonment
             of at least two years had his conviction been a conviction  in
             the United Kingdom of a similar offence. ...

         (6)A presumption under subsection (2), (3) or  (4)  that  a  person
         constitutes a  danger  to  the  community  is  rebuttable  by  that
         person."

36. This appellant was convicted in Austria of an offence similar  to  that
    of which he was convicted in the United Kingdom,  and  sentenced  to  2
    years imprisonment.  He was then convicted of trafficking  offences  in
    the United Kingdom, and sentenced  to  almost  4  years'  imprisonment.
    Both section 72(2) and 72(3) apply to him and Mr  Sharma  accepts  that
    the presumption has been raised that he is a danger to the community of
    the United Kingdom.

37. Mr Sharma is correct in  identifying  that  the  question  whether  the
    section 72 presumption has been rebutted by the claimant is one of fact
    for the Tribunal today.  The claimant began his  unlawful  activity  in
    May 2017, having been issued with a British passport  enabling  him  to
    travel just three months earlier, in February 2017.  He  continued  his
    illegal activity  until  October  2017,  when  he  and  his  Greek  co-
    conspirator were arrested in Austria.

38. The claimant was responsible  for  the  collection  and  management  of
    significant sums of money.  The organisation, in which he was a leader,
    was sophisticated, effective, and resulted  in  an  unknown  number  of
    middle class Iranians travelling to the  United  Kingdom  via  European
    Union   destinations,  making  use  of  false  European  Union   travel
    documents, and then claiming asylum in the  United  Kingdom.   That  is
    about as far from respecting the international protection given to  him
    by the United Kingdom as it is possible to be.    Whilst  there  is  no
    evidence that any of those for  whom  the  claimant  arranged  unlawful
    entry to the United Kingdom were a threat to the United Kingdom, either
    on health or terrorism grounds, the method

39. I have regard to the claimant's continued refusal to  acknowledge  that
    he obtained any financial gain from his trafficking activity,  and  his
    assertion that he acted under duress  from  corrupt  Iranian  officials
    threatening his brother  in  Iran,  which  was  rejected  both  by  the
    sentencing judge and the  person  who  prepared  the  OASys  report  in
    January 2021.  The claimant's account about how many  of  his  brothers
    have died is different in what he told the OASys interviewer  and  what
    he says elsewhere.

40. The OASys report assesses the claimant's offences as being  financially
    motivated, and his likelihood of reoffending as being low, as  long  as
    he has employment and sufficient finance, which clearly he did not have
    before his imprisonment, despite his work as a pizza chef.

41. The burden on the claimant is to satisfy me that he will not return  to
    the profitable people trafficking which he previously  organised.   The
    evidence before me consists of an assertion to that effect in  November
    2019 and another to the OASys interviewing officer.  I have  regard  to
    the First-tier Judge's assessment that the claimant is not  a  reliable
    witness,  even  to  the  lower  standard  applicable  in  international
    protection appeals.

42. Taking all of the evidence before me,  I  am  not  satisfied  that  the
    claimant, on whom lies the burden of proof, has rebutted the section 72
    presumptions.

43. The claimant's appeal is dismissed.

DECISION

44. For the foregoing reasons, my decision is as follows:


    The making of the previous decision involved the making of an error  on
    a point of law.
    I set aside the previous decision.  I remake the decision by dismissing
    the claimant's appeal.
