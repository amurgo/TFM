For the Appellant:     Miss J Bond, Counsel, instructed by Freemans
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Miss S Walker, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria. She was born on 6 July  1953  and
    so is now 60 years old.  She appealed unsuccessfully to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal a decision of the respondent on 17  January  2013  refusing  to
    vary her leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom.  By  reason  of
    this decision her permission to be in the United Kingdom came to an  end
    and she appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. The application was refused with reference to  paragraph  317(i)(e)  and
    (iii) of HC 395.  That is to say the respondent was not  satisfied  that
    if the appellant were living outside the United  Kingdom  she  would  be
    living  in  the  "most  exceptional  compassionate  circumstances"   and
    "financially wholly or mainly dependant  on  the  relative  present  and
    settled in the United Kingdom".  The respondent did not believe that the
    appellant was wholly or mainly dependent on her son who was  settled  in
    the United Kingdom because,  according  to  the  respondent,  there  was
    insufficient evidence to support the claim and she did not believe  that
    the  appellant  would  be  living  alone   in   the   most   exceptional
    compassionate circumstances because at the time of her  application  for
    permission to enter the United Kingdom  she  claimed  to  be  living  in
    rented accommodation on her own and drawing an income from a  restaurant
    business.

 3. Regrettably the First-tier Tribunal Judge plainly  misdirected  herself.
    She seemed uncertain about the test that had to be satisfied given  that
    the appellant was making her application from within the United Kingdom.
      If there was any doubt on this point it was settled authoritatively in
    the case of MB (Para 317:  in-country  applications)  Bangladesh  [2006]
    UKAIT 00091.  The ratio of the case  is  summed  up  in  the  head  note
    prepared by the Tribunal which states:

         "The appellant needs to show that he  would  meet  the  substantive
         requirements of paragraph 317 if he were still in his own  country.
         It is  not  sufficient  to  show  that  he  is  able  to  meet  the
         requirements of the Rules whilst he is in the United Kingdom."

 4. Mr Walker could not defend the decision and I moved  on  to  redetermine
    the appeal.

 5. Miss Bond asked for the case to be adjourned.  Her reasons were that the
    case was not well prepared and  she  wanted  to  do  better.   That  was
    undoubtedly right but was no reason to adjourn the appeal.   The  appeal
    should have been ready when it was heard in May 2013 and  there  was  no
    good reason at all to allow further time.

 6. It is for the appellant to show on the balance of probabilities that her
    circumstances satisfy the circumstances of the Rules.  It is  also  open
    to her to show that her removal consequent on the decision  would  be  a
    disproportionate interference with her private and family life.   To the
    extent that ideas on the burden and standard of proof are meaningful  in
    the context of an Article 8 balancing exercise it is for  the  appellant
    to show that removal  would  interfere  with  her  rights  and  for  the
    respondent to show that the removal is justified.   Matters  are  to  be
    resolved to the "real risk" standard.

 7. I begin by seeing how the appellant presented her application.  When she
    made her application she gave her address in the United Kingdom as "Flat
    8" in a street in south east London.  She said that her home in  Nigeria
    was owned by her landlord. She lived alone and the property was not in a
    good state of repair.  She had an income "from my  restaurant  business"
    (question 4.9) and received financial support from her son in the United
    Kingdom.

 8. She explained that her circumstances have changed.   After  arriving  in
    the United Kingdom as a visitor she was admitted to hospital because  of
    complications arising from diabetes and her  right  leg  was  amputated.
    She had been recovering at her son's home  and  said  "I  will  find  it
    extremely difficult to adapt and cope in Nigeria as I will be on my own.
     The medical facilities in Nigeria are also non-existent as a result  of
    which I will not be able to lead a dignified life."

 9. She then said how her son paid a precise sum just a little short of �600
    a month for his accommodation in the United Kingdom  and  she  would  be
    able to have her own room there.

10. There was also produced documentation about her mortgagee on flat 8  and
    also a "Confidential Occupational Therapy  Home  Visit  Report"  arising
    from an inspection on 17 May 2012 of an address  in  Mitcham  where  the
    appellant then lived.

11. It was said on that occasion that she lived with her "niece and her  two
    sons (aged 2 and 4 years)". The bathroom, and particularly the lavatory,
    was unsuitable for a person with her disability.

12. There are statements from Barclays Bank and payslips.

13. Before me the appellant gave evidence and adopted  her  statement.   Her
    statement is dated 23 May 2013 and was clearly  signed  at  the  hearing
    before the First-tier Tribunal.   She explained there that she  intended
    to visit her son in the United Kingdom for a  short  visit  as  she  had
    frequently done in the past but was admitted to hospital and  eventually
    her leg was amputated.

14. She found it a matter for "shock and  surprise"  that  she  was  refused
    leave to  remain  as  her  son  was  "in  a  position  to  maintain  and
    accommodate me without recourse to public funds".

15. She said that the attention given to her in the United Kingdom was  just
    not available to people in  her  circumstances  in  Nigeria.  Vulnerable
    people, as she would be, are "an easy target for hoodlums  who  prey  on
    the weak and disabled".

16. She also claims she was emotionally close to her son who supported her.

17. She said in her statement that she  was  a  "self-employed  trader"  and
    managed with financial assistance from her son.

18. The business had collapsed in her  absence  and  the  accommodation  had
    been repossessed by the landlord as she was not prepared to pay rent for
    an occupied property.

19. She did not feel able to contemplate coping with life in Nigeria.

20. She had no assets or property or savings in Nigeria.

21. In answer to additional questions she said that the  "niece"  identified
    in the occupational therapist's report was in fact  her  son's  partner.
    They had since married although they did not  live  together.   Her  son
    supported her in the United Kingdom. In  Nigeria  she  said  she  had  a
    little business selling mainly soft drinks, minerals and bottled  water.
    She managed it on her own.  When she left Nigeria she had a pickup motor
    vehicle which she drove to a warehouse to get stock.  Occasionally stock
    was delivered but such deliveries were both unreliable and expensive and
    she could not run the business profitably without being able  to  drive.
    She could not drive now that her leg had been amputated.   She  asserted
    that automatic transmission  vehicles  were  not  available  in  Nigeria
    although qualified that a little to  suggest  they  were  available  but
    would cost too much to maintain.

22. She said that she spent about �600 a month when she  lived  in  Nigeria,
    that �100 came reliably from her son and about �500 from  her  business.
    If she had to employ a person to do the work that she would  do  if  she
    were able bodied she would expect to pay about �250  a  month  for  such
    assistance.

23. She had no contact with other relatives in  Nigeria.  She  had  brothers
    but had not seen them for over twenty years.

24. She was cross-examined.

25. She said that during her frequent  visits  to  the  United  Kingdom  the
    business was managed by an employee, that the employee  was  subject  to
    her close direction and did not have the business sense to manage in her
    absence.

26. The pickup truck had been retained by mechanics who  sold  it  to  cover
    the cost of repairs.  Her property had been repossessed by the landlord.
     It should be said the appellant did not suggest there was  anything  at
    all unfair about the conduct of  the  mechanics  or  the  landlord.  She
    clearly regarded this as an appropriate way of  settling  her  financial
    obligations but the fact is she now no longer had anywhere to  live  and
    no longer had a motor vehicle to use for her business.

27. She said that her diabetes could be treated in  Nigeria  and  medication
    was often available to her without charge from  the  hospitals  and  was
    always available if she was willing to pay.

28. She said she had neighbours in Nigeria with whom  she  was  on  friendly
    terms and she had friends at church but no one close.  The employee  who
    looked after the shop did not count as a friend.

29. Mr Adedayo Oladele Omowon identified himself as the appellant's son  and
    gave evidence before me.  He too adopted a  statement  made  on  23  May
    2013.

30. He said that he was the only child of  his  mother  and  he  had  looked
    after her since she arrived in the United Kingdom.   There was no one in
    Nigeria who could look after her.  His home was in  the  United  Kingdom
    where he had family obligations.  He described it  as  "extremely  harsh
    and unpalatable" to think of his mother living in Nigeria.  She would be
    in a vulnerable position and an easy target.

31. His father abandoned his mother when he was  about  8  years  old.   His
    father had other wives.  His mother was not a widow.

32. In answer to additional questions he said that he earned  about  �20,000
    per year after tax.

33. He said that he was married and had three children.  His wife  did  some
    charity work as a church secretary although she had stopped that  during
    her pregnancy. A third child had been born fairly recently.

34. She said that he did not currently  live  with  his  wife  and  children
    because "according to our tribal custom we are not  a  couple  until  we
    have done some things." I think that this was an enigmatic reference  to
    paying some kind of dowry but this is not important.

35. He said that his mother stayed with his wife for  about  a  month  after
    she came out of hospital and then removed to live with him.

36. He explained how she managed in the house.  She said that she could  not
    cook because she was not able to  cope  with  big  pans.   He  typically
    provided small amounts of food  which  she  heated  as  necessary  in  a
    microwave oven that he had placed in the sitting room to  be  convenient
    for her.  He said that she did bits of cooking.  For example, she cooked
    noodles and made tea and coffee and was able to look  after  herself  in
    the bathroom but could not run the home.  He said he was responsible for
    her and there was no one else did help.

37. He was cross-examined.  He confirmed  that  his  mother's  business  had
    closed and the accommodation was no longer available to her.

38. He did not think that his mother would ever drive  again.   He  accepted
    that it might be possible for her to pay a driver.  His real concern was
    that she would be vulnerable as a disabled person.

39. I confirm that I considered all the papers before  me,  including  those
    that  I  have  not  found  necessary  to  describe  expressly   in   the
    determination.

40. There is an  article  from  the  "National  Mirror"  under  the  heading
    "Nigerian Physically Challenged Cry Out: We are being humiliated!"   The
    article says that there is little or no consideration for the  needs  of
    disabled people in Nigeria. Disabled people found it  difficult  to  get
    employment and public transport  was  inaccessible.   An  article  in  a
    similar vein came from "Vanguard" under the heading "Lamentations of the
    physically challenged". This referred to people being shunned because of
    disability.   Another  article  called  for  a  need  for  mass   public
    education.

41. I find the appellant has been broadly truthful.  There  were  irritating
    inconsistencies in the evidence. Her son talked about her  visiting  for
    up to four weeks and she referred to visiting for  up  to  four  months.
    Clearly one of them was not telling the truth and it is difficult to see
    how this discrepancy could have been the result of  an  honest  mistake.
    The  different  timescales  are  considerable.   It  would   have   been
    interesting to know why the appellant said in her application  that  she
    had an income from a restaurant business but told me  about  a  business
    selling mainly soft drinks.

42. However, the entirely straightforward way in which she spoke  about  the
    business she ran in Nigeria was impressive.  She did  not  claim  to  be
    particularly poor or particularly successful. She did not suggest that a
    pickup truck was necessary for the business, simply it made it  a  great
    deal easier to run the business profitably. Neither did she suggest that
    it was impossible to find the labour to assist.  Rather the  cost  would
    make big inroads into profitability. There are so many ways in which she
    could have exaggerated this aspect of her evidence but did  not  that  I
    find it probably that she was  broadly  telling  me  the  truth.   I  am
    satisfied that before she came to the United Kingdom she did run a small
    shop which was profitable and the main but not the only  source  of  her
    income.

43. I am also satisfied that that business is no longer available to her.

44. I was also impressed with  the  way  the  appellant  had  addressed  her
    disability.  I hope with appropriate respect for her  privacy,  I  asked
    her to explain the nature  of  the  amputation  and  she  said  that  it
    involved the leg being cut off just below  the  knee.  She  was  clearly
    using some kind of prosthesis and was managing to get about  on  walking
    sticks. I do not want it to be thought I am suggesting that she  managed
    without difficulty.  That would be most unfair but she did not  give  me
    any reason to think she was exaggerating her  difficulties.   She  is  a
    woman who can slowly walk reasonable distances to get  about  if  people
    are prepared to be patient and help her.  She could not  manage  without
    help and understanding.

45. The evidence  of  financial  support  was  not  entirely  clear.   I  am
    satisfied that the appellant's son is in regular work earning  the  sort
    of sums he indicated and that he paid money to his mother frequently and
    in the kind of sums they indicated.  This is very believable  and  again
    it is not determinative of the case.

46. Much was made about the appellant's age but she is only 60 years old.

47. If she were returned to Nigeria  I  accept  there  would  be  no  family
    support but she is a woman capable of developing acquaintances  and  has
    told me that she has people she knows through church.   There  is  every
    reason to think that these relationships would be resumed in  the  event
    of her return.

48. I accept that disabled people generally in Nigeria are treated in a  way
    that would be unacceptable to the majority  of  the  population  in  the
    United Kingdom.  I have directed myself, although there is  no  evidence
    before me exactly on the point, that it would be more difficult for  her
    to keep her prosthesis in good order  in  Nigeria  than  in  the  United
    Kingdom.  I know from my own reading that artificial limbs do not have a
    particularly long life before they have to be replaced.

49. I find that in the  even  of  the  appellant  remaining  in  the  United
    Kingdom the appellant probably would be maintained without  recourse  to
    public funds as is required by the rules.  The appellant's  son  clearly
    has a home  and  the  additional  costs  of  feeding  and  clothing  the
    appellant are not great.  He lives modestly within his means  and  I  am
    satisfied has a high sense of responsibility towards his mother.

50. The big difficulty I have with is whether or not the appellant would  be
    living alone the "most exceptional compassionate circumstances".

51. It is absolutely plain to me that the appellant and her son want her  to
    remain in the United Kingdom.  It is also plain to  me  that  she  could
    live there without being dependent on public  funds  setting  aside  the
    costs of her treatment to the health service.  There is  nothing  before
    me to show that the appellant has had  anything  to  which  she  is  not
    entitled or that I should in some way construe against her the fact that
    she has taken advantage of the health facilities offered to her.

52. I cannot see how a woman who has clearly quite  a  cute  business  sense
    and who had been  able to produce most of her income from  trade  whilst
    she was in Nigeria in the past could be said to be living alone  in  the
    most exceptional compassionate circumstances.  Whilst I do not doubt for
    a moment she would prefer to remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  with  her
    family who would prefer her to live there, even when  I  allow  for  the
    difficulties faced by disabled people in Nigeria she would be capable of
    finding some kind of modest employment.  I do not accept that she  would
    be living in the kind of social isolation or penury that would enable me
    to find honestly that she  is  living  alone  in  the  most  exceptional
    compassionate circumstances.

53. Miss Bond is very experienced and anticipated that this may well be  the
    difficulty I faced.  She put her case thoroughly and clearly and I  have
    taken it all into account and given it proper weight, but  I  cannot  be
    persuaded on the evidence before me that the requirements of  the  Rules
    are satisfied.

54. Removal would plainly  interfere  with  her  private  and  family  life.
    Indeed one might think the whole purpose of the Immigration Rules is  to
    interfere with a person's private and  family  life.   I  have  reminded
    myself of the test  in  Regina  v.  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department ex parte Razgar [2004] UKHL 27 but the real question here  is
    whether removal is  proportionate.   Policy  makers  do  not  limit  the
    requirements of people wishing to live in the United  Kingdom  to  being
    able to maintain and accommodate themselves without recourse  to  public
    funds.  There are restrictions that are imposed to  control  immigration
    and one of them is that people who are below the age of 60, married  and
    not living in the most exceptional compassionate circumstances  are  not
    allowed to settle. This restriction is consistent  with  the  legitimate
    aims of protecting the economic well being of the United Kingdom and the
    rights and freedoms of others. Nothing before me has persuaded  me  that
    applying the rules is a disproportionate interference with  the  private
    and family life of this appellant or her family in the United Kingdom.

55. This is a decision that gives me no pleasure whatsoever but  it  is  the
    one required by the Rules and although I set aside the decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal I replace it with a decision dismissing the appeal.
