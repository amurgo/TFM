                            DECISION AND REASONS

Anonymity order

Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008
(SI 2008/269) The Tribunal has ORDERED that no one shall publish  or  reveal
the name or address of A V P who is the  subject  of  these  proceedings  or
publish or reveal any information which would  be  likely  to  lead  to  the
identification of him or of any member of  his  family  in  connection  with
these proceedings.

Any failure to comply with this direction could give  rise  to  contempt  of
court proceedings.

Decision and reasons

 1. The Secretary of State appeals with permission from the decision of the
    First-tier Tribunal  allowing  her  appeal  against  the  Secretary  of
    State's decision on 4 February 2019 to refuse her leave to  remain  and
    to refuse to revoke a decision to deport her to  Nigeria,  communicated
    to her on 16 December 2014. The claimant is a citizen of Nigeria.

 2. The appeal was heard remotely by Skype for Business.  There  were  some
    technical difficulties in that Ms Cunha, who appears for the  Secretary
    of State, had a very weak broadband signal and  her  image  froze  from
    time to time, but by dint of her leaving and re-entering  the  hearing,
    and me telling her the last submission which it had  been  possible  to
    hear, we were able to complete the hearing.

 3. Both Counsel were in a quiet and private place and are well aware  that
    it is a criminal offence to record the hearing.  I  am  satisfied  that
    the hearing was conducted fairly.

Background

 4. The claimant was born in 1975 and came to the United Kingdom  in  2005,
    when she was 30 years old.  In her statement she says she did so  on  a
    visit visa, but the Home Office record shows that on arrival, she  told
    the immigration officer at the Port that she had lost her passport, and
    was granted 6 months' leave to enter or remain.  However, the  claimant
    never substantiated her claim to have lost her passport.  She  took  no
    steps to regulate her position for 6 years,  nor  did  she  embark  for
    Nigeria.

 5. In 2007 and 2010, the claimant had children by a British  citizen,  her
    children  therefore  both  being  British  citizens  by  descent.   The
    claimant was a single mother at all times: her  children's  father  was
    married to another woman and they also have children.  The evidence  in
    documents in the claimant's bundle is that her children are doing  well
    at school and have friendships here.  They are now 14 and 11 years old,
    and have never lived in Nigeria, nor are they  familiar  with  Nigerian
    culture or languages, on her account.

 6. On 27 April 2011, the claimant sought leave to  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom on human rights grounds, and on 21 June 2011, she  was  granted
    discretionary leave until 21 June 2014.

 7. Between 2006 and 2012, the claimant obtained state benefits  by  fraud,
    using a counterfeit French passport.  She is not, and never has been, a
    French citizen, but the document she was using enabled her to obtain an
    EEA residence card which would have entitled her to work.  However, the
    claimant did not work and  claimed  over  �83000  of  benefits  instead
    during that 6-year period.

 8. When the fraud was discovered, the claimant was prosecuted  and  on  10
    October 2013, she was sentenced to 15 months on  all  of  the  offences
    charged, to run concurrently. The charges were  that  she  had  made  a
    false statement or representation so as to obtain benefit, used a false
    instrument and been knowingly concerned in fraudulent activity  with  a
    view to obtaining payment of a tax credit to herself or  another.   The
    claimant did not appeal either the sentence or the conviction.

 9. The claimant's incarceration from October 2013 to May 2015 presented  a
    difficulty as to who should care  for  her  children.   The  claimant's
    daughters would have been 6 and 3 years old, at that time.

10. The children's natural father, and his wife, took them  in  for  the  7
    months that the claimant spent in prison.  It does  not  seem  to  have
    gone well: the children did not  like  their  father's  wife,  nor  her
    cooking, and said that she treated them badly.  Since the claimant left
    prison and the children returned to her, her  evidence  is  that  their
    father has had minimal contact with them.

11. There is nothing in the evidence before  me  to  confirm  that  if  the
    claimant left the United Kingdom, he would accommodate and  bring  them
    up through their teenage years.  On her account,  they  have  not  seen
    much of him for the last 7 years. He pays �100 a month maintenance, and
    telephones them on their birthdays.

12. The claimant contends that it would be difficult to  obtain  schooling,
    accommodation and care for the children in Nigeria if they  accompanied
    her, and that her employment prospects there would be poor.

Sentencing remarks

13. The sentencing remarks of Judge Wilkinson on 10 October 2013  described
    the claimant's actions as 'serious frauds'. The  claimant  had  entered
    the United Kingdom in 2005 on false documentation and the frauds  began
    on 6 November 2006, when she was  still  an  illegal  immigration  from
    Nigeria.  She had received over �83000 in benefits with the  assistance
    of her false French  passport  and  her  pretence  of  being  a  French
    citizen:

         "Each claim that  you  made  was  fraudulent  from  the  beginning.
         Inevitably, these offences are so serious that  only  an  immediate
         custodial sentence can be justified.  I take into account  on  your
         behalf, first of all,  your  plea  of  guilty  at  the  preliminary
         hearing.  I give you full credit for  those  please.   Secondly,  I
         take into account the fact that since June  of  2011,  you've  been
         granted limited right to remain by  the  Home  Office,  though  you
         still continued to claim fraudulently as a  French  citizen.   This
         was an opportunity for you to regularise your  position.   You  did
         not take it. No doubt, you considered that to disclose your  change
         of status would reveal your earlier fraudulent conduct. ...

         Next, I, of course, note the content of the  PSR  and  lastly,  and
         most of all, I bear in mind your two young children.  It is a  fact
         that you are the sole carer.  It is a fact that they will  be  hurt
         by your imprisonment, but, at the end of the day,  children  simply
         cannot be used as a bargaining chip.

         The least sentence that I can pass on you is one of fifteen months'
         imprisonment.  If you behave yourself, you will be out in seven and
         a half months, less the credit that will be given to  you  for  the
         tagged qualifying curfew.... "

    The 15 months' sentence was concurrent on all charges.

Secretary of State's refusal letter

14. On 29 October 2013, the Secretary of State wrote to the claimant to say
    that pursuant to section 32(5) of the UK  Borders  Act  2007,  she  was
    required to make a deportation order against the claimant as a  foreign
    criminal, subject to the claimant showing that she could bring  herself
    within any of the Exceptions in that statute.

15. The claimant responded on 19 November 2013, claiming to fear return  to
    Nigeria, based on an alleged death threat from immediate family members
    in Nigeria, because of her father's wealth. When the Secretary of State
    asked the claimant's representatives for more details,  they  clarified
    that she did not want to claim asylum  but  wished  to  remain  in  the
    United Kingdom as the parent of two British citizen children.  In  June
    2014, the claimant made an application for  leave  to  remain  on  that
    basis.

16. On 16 December 2014, the respondent made a deportation order.

17. On 18 August 2015, the  claimant's  representatives  raised  an  asylum
    claim and she was interviewed.  A statement of additional  grounds  was
    provided.  On 29 July 2016,  the  international  protection  and  human
    rights claim was rejected, and certified under sections 94 and  94B  of
    the 2002 Act, with an out of country right of appeal.  The claimant did
    not depart from the United  Kingdom.   She  made  further  submissions,
    which were rejected under paragraph 353 of the Immigration Rules HC 395
    (as amended) on 9 June 2017.

18. Following the decision of the Supreme Court in Kiarie  and  Byndloss  v
    Secretary of  State  for  the  Home  Department  [2017]  UKSC  42,  the
    Secretary of State  withdrew  the  16  December  2014  refusal  of  the
    claimant's human rights claim and her decision of 29 July  2016  and  9
    June 2017, but maintained the deportation order of 16 December 2014.

19. On 4 February 2019, the Secretary of State remade her decision on human
    rights, by reference to all of the previous  submissions  made  by  the
    claimant over the period from 2013  to  2017.   She  refused  leave  to
    remain on human rights grounds and also international protection.

20. The Secretary of State accepted that the claimant  had  a  genuine  and
    subsisting parental relationship with  her  two  children,  both  still
    minors.  She was estranged from  her  former  partner,  the  children's
    father. The claimant was not currently in a relationship.

21. The Secretary of State did not consider that it would be  unduly  harsh
    for the children to remain in the United Kingdom without their  mother,
    or to travel to Nigeria and begin a new life there with her. There  was
    no evidence as to why the children should not relocate to  Nigeria  and
    the claimant, who lived there until the age of 30,  would  be  able  to
    help them adjust and to integrate into life in Nigeria.   There was  no
    evidence that the claimant's children would not be entitled to Nigerian
    citizenship or be able to reside there  on  another  basis  with  their
    mother, should they  accompany  her.   Education  and  healthcare  were
    available in Nigeria.

22. The Secretary of State did not accept the claimant's assertion that the
    children's father was unfit to care for them.  There was no evidence of
    this,  beyond  her  bare  assertion.   The  children  might  have  some
    difficulties initially if they were living with him, but would  adjust.
    They could  stay  in  touch  with  their  mother  by  modern  means  of
    communication and visit her either  in  Nigeria  or  a  third  country,
    albeit infrequently because of the cost of flights.   There  were  over
    144 million mobile phone users in Nigeria.

23.  The  Secretary  of  State  did  not  consider  that  there  were  very
    significant obstacles to the claimant herself reintegrating in Nigeria.
     She was not integrated in the United Kingdom; she had not worked  here
    or made any positive contribution  to  society,  but  had  depended  on
    benefits to which she was not  entitled.  The  claimant  had  lived  in
    Nigeria until she was  30  years  old;  English  was  the  language  in
    Nigeria.  The claimant was entitled to apply to the Facilitated Returns
    Scheme which would provide some funds to help alleviate  any  financial
    difficulties on return.  Nor were there  any  compelling  circumstances
    for which leave to remain should be granted outside the Rules.

24.    The    appellant    appealed    to    the    First-tier    Tribunal.







First-tier Tribunal decision

25. First-tier Judge Davey found  that  it  would  be  disproportionate  to
    remove the claimant from the  United  Kingdom  at  present,  given  the
    circumstances with their father and  step-mother.    He  recorded  that
    there was no evidence that the father, or his wife, would  be  prepared
    to take the children in again if the claimant were deported. But  there
    also was no evidence that breaking the  tenuous  bonds  they  had  with
    their natural father would have  any  effect  on  the  children,  whose
    parental bond was with their mother.

26. There was evidence also that the claimant had been undergoing  training
    and achieved some qualifications, a few years back,  on  mental  health
    and social care, health and safety in the workplace, and food safety in
    catering.  Her evidence was that she aspired to taking a nursing degree
    at University.  She was not  pursuing  any  training  at  present,  the
    latest being a childcare  course  in  June  2018.   In  2013,  she  had
    undertaken a course in nursing, midwifery and health studies.

27. Section 117D(1) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (as
    amended) was applicable: the claimant's children, as British  citizens,
    were qualifying children. the judge then found that it would be  unduly
    harsh and unreasonable for the claimant to be removed  to  Nigeria  and
    for her British citizen children to be expected to accompany her there,
    with reference  to  section  117B(6)  of  the  2002  Act.    The  judge
    dismissed the international protection appeal but allowed the appeal on
    human rights grounds on that basis.

28. The Secretary of State appealed to the Upper Tribunal.

29. The claimant has not challenged  the  dismissal  of  her  international
    protection claim.

Permission to appeal

30. There was a single ground of appeal, 'making a material misdirection of
    law'.  The Secretary of State contended  that  undue  weight  had  been
    given to the effect on the  claimant's  children;  that  there  was  no
    reasoned finding that they would face undue harshness if they  remained
    in the United Kingdom living with  their  father;  that  there  was  no
    finding  by  the  First-tier  Judge  that  they  were   mistreated   or
    inadequately cared at their father's home for during the 7 months their
    mother was in prison; and that the  First-tier  Judge's  reasoning  for
    finding that it would be unduly harsh  for  the  children  to  live  in
    Nigeria was also inadequately reasoned.

31. The First-tier Judge's findings did not go beyond the finding  that  it
    would not be in the children's best interests to live in Nigeria, which
    was not the relevant test.  The First-tier  Judge's  decision  did  not
    explain why there was in this case a degree of harshness  going  beyond
    what would necessarily  be  involved  for  any  child  faced  with  the
    deportation of a parent.

32. The error in the First-tier  Judge's  findings  on  these  matters  had
    infected his consideration of the high public interest in  deportation:
    see OH (Serbia) v Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department  [2008]
    EWCA Civ 694.

33. Permission to appeal was granted  by  First-tier  Judge  Povey  in  the
    following terms:

         "3.  The judge recorded the lack of evidence as to the  ability  or
         willingness of the children's father to look after the children  in
         the  United  Kingdom,  the  impact  upon  the   children   of   the
         [claimant's] removal, or them returning to Nigeria with her, and of
         the children's lives in the United  Kingdom  (at  [10]-[12]).   The
         judge went on to conclude that it would be  unduly  harsh  for  the
         children to relocate to Nigeria (at [25]-[26]) and appeared to also
         find that it would b unduly  harsh  for  the  children  (as  United
         Kingdom citizens) to remain in the  United  Kingdom  without  their
         mother (at [28]-[29]).  However, there was merit in the  [Secretary
         of State's] contention of an absence of adequate reasons  for  both
         conclusions, particularly given the paucity of evidence adduced  by
         the [claimant] and the 'unduly harsh' thresholds  contained  within
         case law.  As those findings were material to the  outcome  of  the
         appeal, they constituted arguable errors of law."

Rule 24 Reply

34. On 9 March 2020, Upper Tribunal Judge O'Connor directed the parties  to
    file skeleton arguments and trial bundles,  a  rule  15(2A)  notice  if
    required, and trial bundles, within 28 days.

35. The respondent filed a skeleton argument on 30 March 2020.  She  noted,
    which she had not in her grounds of appeal, that the  First-tier  Judge
    had directed himself that he was not dealing with a deportation  appeal
    (see [16]).  He had then applied  the  reasonableness  standard  rather
    than the higher test required in section 117C of the 2002 Act and in so
    doing, had fallen into plain error of law.

36. The First-tier Judge had been 'unimpressed by the [claimant's] evidence
    in regard to her circumstances and her clear lack of remorse in  regard
    to her conduct' but had failed to give clear,  cogent  reasons  showing
    why, despite the lack of evidence, and  the  poor  credibility  of  the
    claimant's oral evidence, it would be unduly harsh for her children  to
    remain in the United Kingdom with their father.    The  factors  relied
    upon by the First-tier Judge were 'entirely ordinary factors that  will
    apply to almost every case where a foreign national offender is part of
    a genuine and subsisting relationship and has British children'.  There
    needed to be something more than the loss of a parent, especially  when
    the other parent remains in the United Kingdom and has provided care in
    the past.  The appeal should be  allowed  and  the  First-tier  Judge's
    decision set aside.

37. On 11 August 2020, the claimant filed an out of  time  Rule  24  reply,
    settled by Benjamin Hawkin of Counsel. He contended that the First-tier
    Judge's decision was thoughtful,  careful  and  balanced,  arriving  at
    conclusions which were clearly  open  to  him  on  the  evidence.   The
    grounds of appeal did not establish an arguable material error  of  law
    and were in reality simply a  disagreement  with  the  outcome  of  the
    appeal.  The Upper Tribunal should be extremely slow to interfere  with
    a decision of the First-tier Tribunal,  merely  because  another  judge
    might have reached a different decision.

38. The findings of fact in the First-tier Judge's decision (set out at [7]
    in the Rule 24 reply) were open to him on the evidence  and  the  Upper
    Tribunal should uphold his decision: not only was the  assessment  made
    open to the judge on the facts of the case, but, submitted  Mr  Hawkin,
    it was the entirely proper outcome.

39. The Secretary of State did not exercise her right  to  respond  to  the
    Rule 24 reply promptly, nor did she respond to triage  directions  sent
    by the Upper Tribunal on 22 April and 14 July 2020.  By a decision sent
    to the parties on  1  December  2020,  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Mandalia
    decided that the appeal could be dealt with at a remote hearing.

40. That is the basis on which this appeal came before the Upper Tribunal.

Claimant's bundle

41. On 7 January 2021, the appellant filed a 252-page bundle of  documents,
    both electronically (on 5 January) and physically.  There was  no  rule
    15(2A) application: this appears to have  been  the  bundle  which  was
    before the First-tier Judge.

42. The only document in that bundle  to  which  I  was  referred  was  the
    claimant's statement, the relevant portion of which is at [6] and [9]:

         "6.  ... If I was forced to relocate to Nigeria my  children  would
         have no-one.  Their father would not be able to take them in as  he
         has a family of their own. ...

         9.   My children has grown up and  developed  here  in  the  United
         Kingdom and they are very fond of British culture and British  life
         style and this is the only culture and life style  they  have  ever
         known.   My  children  are  not  familiar  with  nigh  culture  and
         therefore they would find it very difficult to adjust, as  this  is
         the only home they have ever known.  Furthermore, they have  rights
         as British citizens, therefore it would be unfair for  them  to  be
         forced to relocate to Nigeria."

    At [13] the claimant asserted that 'it would cause extreme hardship for
    me and my children and me [sic] to relocate to Nigeria'.

43. There are also letters from friends: at  page  181  in  the  bundle,  a
    friend who has children at the same school as the claimant's  son  said
    that when the  claimant  was  away  for  months,  the  child  had  lost
    concentration at school, been visibly unhappy, losing  weight  and  not
    eating a regular meal, looking unkempt, always crying at school and not
    participating in any  school  activities.   The  writer  described  the
    claimant as dedicated to her children and always willing to help out.

44. Another letter says that in 2014, when the claimant  was  absent,  both
    children were affected  physically,  emotionally  and  psychologically.
    They were not being looked after properly, as their  mother  did.   'It
    was a bad moment for the children, without their  mother  being  around
    them for several months'. From page 184 to  252  are  black  and  white
    photocopies of photographs of the children and their mother.  There are
    no photographs of them with their father and no  witness  statement  or
    other evidence from him.

45. At page 136 in the bundle is an attendance report from 2 September 2013
    to 23 May 2014, which would cover the period  when  the  children  were
    living with their father. They achieved a 99.28% attendance,  with  one
    authorised absence,  no  unauthorised  absences,  one  illness,  and  6
    occasions when they were late for school, but before registers  closed.
    The remaining school materials postdate the imprisonment  period;  they
    show the children  flourishing  and  progressing  at  their  respective
    schools.

Upper Tribunal hearing

46. For the Secretary of State, Ms Cunha submitted that the evidence simply
    was not sufficient to support the First-tier Judge's findings of  fact.
    He had drawn inferences, but without considering the acts of  long-term
    deception which had led  to  the  claimant's  conviction.   She  should
    receive no credit for not having offended subsequently as she had  been
    in prison until 2014, on  licence  till  the  end  of  that  year,  and
    thereafter subject to a deportation order.  It  would  have  been  very
    unintelligent of her to offend again.

47. The First-tier  Judge's  decision  did  not  consider  undue  harshness
    properly.  Ms Cunha relied on HA (Iraq) v Secretary of  State  for  the
    Home Department [2020] EWCA Civ 1176 at [52]-[52] in  the  judgment  of
    Lord Justice Underhill (with whom Lord Justice Peter Jackson  and  Lord
    Justice Popplewell agreed). The Secretary of State's appeal  should  be
    allowed.

48. For the claimant, Mr Youseffian accepted that the First-tier Judge  had
    erred in directing himself that there  was  no  deportation  order  and
    applying section 117B(6).  However, if the decision  were  read  fairly
    and as a whole, the unduly harsh finding was sustainable and sufficient
    reasons had been given.  Mr Youseffian relied on  HA  (Iraq)  at  [50]-
    [56].

49. The  First-tier  Judge  had  been  persuaded  by  the  claimant's  oral
    evidence.  First-tier Judge Davey was an experienced judge and  it  was
    open to him to accept part of  an  otherwise  incredible  account:  see
    Chiver.  The Secretary of  State's  bundle  contained  many  manuscript
    letters from the claimant on which the judge was entitled to rely.

50. If the claimant's children did not return to Nigeria with her when  she
    was deported, they would at best spend the  rest  of  their  childhoods
    with their father and step-mother.  Having  their  mother  ripped  away
    from them would cause serious emotional harm, given  the  closeness  of
    the relationship between mother and children in this case.  He referred
    to the support letters in the bundle, which said  the  claimant  was  a
    good mother.

51. The claimant had always been a single parent mother.  In her letter  of
    2012, she said that she still shared a bed with her children (then aged
    2 and 4 years old).

52. Mr Youseffian accepted that there was no  professional  evidence  about
    the children or the harm which might occur if they were separated  from
    their mother.  They had lived with her for 7 years since she  came  out
    of prison, and what was involved here was more than  undesirability  or
    discomfort.

53. Mr Youseffian asked me to dismiss the Secretary of State's appeal.

54. Both representatives argued that if the appeal  were  allowed  and  the
    First-tier Judge's decision set aside, it would be preferable  for  the
    appeal to be reheard afresh in the First-tier Tribunal,  to  allow  for
    better evidence, including a social worker's report.

55. I reserved my decision, which I now give.

HA (Iraq) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2020] EWCA Civ 1176

56. In HA (Iraq), on which both representatives relied, the guidance on the
    meaning of 'unduly harsh' begins at [50] in Underhill LJ's judgment:

         "50. The essential point is that the criterion of  undue  harshness
         sets a bar  which  is  "elevated"  and  carries  a  "much  stronger
         emphasis" than mere undesirability: see para. 27 of Lord Carnwath's
         judgment, approving the UT's self-direction in MK  (Sierra  Leone),
         and para. 35. ... The  reason  why  some  degree  of  harshness  is
         acceptable is that  there  is  a  strong  public  interest  in  the
         deportation of foreign criminals (including medium offenders):  see
         para. 23. The underlying question  for  tribunals  is  whether  the
         harshness which the deportation will cause for the  partner  and/or
         child is of a sufficiently elevated degree to outweigh that  public
         interest.

         51.  However,  while  recognising  the  "elevated"  nature  of  the
         statutory test, it is important not to lose sight of the fact  that
         the hurdle which it sets is not as high as that set by the test  of
         "very  compelling  circumstances"  in  section  117C  (6).   ...The
         statutory intention is evidently that the hurdle  representing  the
         unacceptable impact on a partner or child should be  set  somewhere
         between the (low) level applying in the case  of  persons  who  are
         liable  to  ordinary  immigration  removal  (see  Lord   Carnwath's
         reference to section 117B (6) at the start of  para.  23)  and  the
         (very high) level applying to serious offenders.

         53.  Observations of that kind  are,  I  hope,  helpful,  but  they
         cannot identify an objectively measurable standard. It is  inherent
         in the nature of an exercise of the kind required by  section  117C
         (5) that Parliament intended that tribunals  should  in  each  case
         make an informed evaluative assessment of whether the effect of the
         deportation of the parent or partner  on  their  child  or  partner
         would be "unduly  harsh"  in  the  context  of  the  strong  public
         interest in the  deportation  of  foreign  criminals;  and  further
         exposition of that phrase will never be of more than limited value.
         ...

         55. ... it is plainly not the case that Lord Carnwath  was  unaware
         of the relevance of section 55:  see  para.  15  of  his  judgment,
         quoted at para. 41 above. The reason why it was unnecessary for him
         to refer explicitly to section 55 specifically in  the  context  of
         his discussion of Exception 2 is  that  the  very  purpose  of  the
         Exception, to the extent that it is concerned with  the  effect  of
         deportation on a child, is to ensure that  the  best  interests  of
         that child are treated as a primary consideration. It  does  so  by
         providing that those interests should, in  the  case  of  a  medium
         offender, prevail over the public interest in deportation where the
         effect on  the  child  would  be  unduly  harsh.  In  other  words,
         consideration of the best interests of the child is built into  the
         statutory test. It was not necessary for Lord Carnwath to spell out
         that in the application of Exception 2 in any particular case there
         will need to  be  "a  careful  analysis  of  all  relevant  factors
         specific to the child"; but I am happy to confirm that that is  so,
         as Lord Hodge makes clear in his sixth proposition in Zoumbas.

         56.  The second point focuses on what are said to be the  risks  of
         treating KO as establishing a touchstone of whether the  degree  of
         harshness goes beyond "that which is  ordinarily  expected  by  the
         deportation of a parent". Lord Carnwath does not in fact  use  that
         phrase, but a reference to "nothing out of the ordinary" appears in
         UTJ  Southern's  decision.  I  see  rather  more  force   in   this
         submission. As explained above, the test  under  section  117C  (5)
         does indeed require an appellant to establish a degree of harshness
         going beyond a threshold "acceptable" level. It is not  necessarily
         wrong to describe that as an "ordinary" level of harshness,  and  I
         note that Lord Carnwath did not jib at UTJ Southern's use  of  that
         term. However, I think the Appellants are right to point  out  that
         it may be misleading if used incautiously. There seem to me  to  be
         two  (related)  risks.  First,  "ordinary"  is  capable  of   being
         understood as meaning anything which is not exceptional, or in  any
         event rare. That is not the correct approach: see para.  52  above.
         There is no reason in principle why cases of "undue" harshness  may
         not  occur  quite  commonly.  Secondly,  if  tribunals  treat   the
         essential question as being "is this level of harshness out of  the
         ordinary?" they may be tempted to find that Exception  2  does  not
         apply simply on  the  basis  that  the  situation  fits  into  some
         commonly-encountered pattern. That would be dangerous. How a  child
         will be affected by a parent's deportation will depend on an almost
         infinitely variable range of circumstances and it is  not  possible
         to identify a baseline of "ordinariness". Simply by way of example,
         the degree of harshness of  the  impact  may  be  affected  by  the
         child's age; by whether the parent  lives  with  them  (NB  that  a
         divorced  or  separated  father  may  still  have  a  genuine   and
         subsisting relationship with a child who lives with the mother); by
         the degree of the child's emotional dependence on  the  parent;  by
         the financial consequences of his deportation; by the  availability
         of emotional and financial support  from  a  remaining  parent  and
         other family  members;  by  the  practicability  of  maintaining  a
         relationship with the deported parent; and of  course  by  all  the
         individual characteristics of the child."

Analysis

57. Although he did not say so, the First-tier Judge  clearly  took  a  dim
    view of the  claimant's  credibility  as  a  witness,  which  makes  it
    difficult to understand why he believed her about the lack  of  contact
    between her children and their father, and his  unwillingness  to  take
    them in if she was deported.  There was nothing from the father and  it
    appeared that he had not been approached.   There  was  no  independent
    social worker's report.

58. The evidence which underpins the First-tier Judge's findings is slight,
    save for the claimant's own assertions.  At [8] he found that there was
    'no merit in any part of her claim to remain on the basis of a  private
    life which the  [claimant]  has  achieved  in  the  United  Kingdom  by
    deception' and that the writers of  the  letters  of  support  did  not
    appear to know why she had been away  from  the  children  for  several
    months, nor 'the extent of her criminality, the cost to the public, and
    her deliberate conduct to obtain the benefits of  life  in  the  United
    Kingdom.

59. At [3], the First-tier Judge dismissed the claimant's account that  she
    was allowed to enter the United Kingdom without a passport for  a  six-
    month period, finding it more likely  that  she  'entered  using  false
    documentation and later sought to conceal it'.  There  was  'simply  no
    evidence' on the very significant point of the father's contribution to
    her children's life, or his willingness to look after them if  she  had
    to leave the United Kingdom.

60. There is no question but that the First-tier Judge fell into  error  of
    law in directing himself that this was not  a  deportation  case,  when
    there was a deportation order, and in consequence, in applying  section
    117B(6) when the correct statutory provision to have applied would have
    been section 117C(2), and Exception 2, set out in section 117C(5):

         "117C Article 8: Additional considerations in cases involving
         foreign criminals

         (1)  The deportation of foreign criminals is in the public
         interest.

         (2)  The more serious the offence committed by a foreign criminal,
         the greater is the public interest in deportation of the criminal.

         (3)  In the case of a foreign criminal (C) who has not been
         sentence to a period of imprisonment of four years or more, the
         public interest requires C's deportation unless Exception 1 or
         Exception 2 applies. ...

         (5)  Exception 2 applies where C has a genuine and subsisting
         relationship with a ...qualifying child, and the effect of C's
         deportation on the ...child would be unduly harsh.

         (6)  In the case of a foreign criminal who has been sentenced to a
         period of imprisonment of at least four years, the public interest
         requires deportation unless there are very compelling
         circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions 1 and
         2"

61. The correct test to be applied here was whether the situation for these
    two children would be  unduly  harsh  and/or  whether  very  compelling
    circumstances outside the Exceptions could  be  shown.   The  confusion
    with the lower standard of reasonableness in section 117B(6) is plainly
    material and regrettably, I have come to the conclusion that it infects
    the entire decision.  It follows that the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Judge must be set aside.

62. It is not possible to remake this  decision  and  to  apply  HA  (Iraq)
    correctly on the basis  of  the  very  limited  information  about  the
    children, and in particular, their relationship with their father.  The
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal will  be  set  aside  for  remaking
    afresh in the First-tier Tribunal.

DECISION

63. For the foregoing reasons, my decision is as follows:

    The making of the previous decision involved the making of an error  on
    a point of law.


    I set aside the previous decision.  The decision on this appeal will be
    remade in the First-tier Tribunal on a date to be fixed.
