Representation:

For the Respondent:    Mr Diwnycz, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Nigeria born in 1981.


 2. The Appellant asserts that she qualifies for leave  to  remain  in  the
    United Kingdom  on  both  human  rights  and  protection  grounds.  The
    decision in her appeal falls to be re-made by  the  Upper  Tribunal  by
    virtue of my decision of the 26th May 2019. The history of  the  matter
    thus far is as follows.

 3. The Appellant has lived in the United Kingdom since  2011  but  claimed
    asylum in 2016 after she had returned  from  a  trip  to  Nigeria.  The
    Respondent refused protection and the Appellant appealed to the  First-
    tier Tribunal.


 4. Her appeal was dismissed by First-tier Tribunal Judge Hudson on the 3rd
    July 2018. The Appellant appealed to the Upper Tribunal, inter alia  on
    the ground that the First-tier Tribunal had erred in  failing  to  give
    adequate weight to, and allowance for, the fact that the Appellant is a
    vulnerable witness who had been judged by a consultant psychiatrist  as
    not fit to give evidence. The Upper  Tribunal  (Deputy  Upper  Tribunal
    Judge Juss) dismissed  the  appeal  on  the  23rd  November  2018.  The
    Appellant sought permission to the Court  of  Appeal.  The  application
    came before Upper Tribunal Judge Jackson who indicated to  the  parties
    that she was minded to 'set aside' the decision of Judge  Juss  on  the
    grounds that he had overlooked the binding Court of Appeal authority of
    AM (Afghanistan) v Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  [2017]
    EWCA Civ 1123.  By her decision of the 25th February 2019  she  invited
    submissions from the parties, in the absence of which she  would  treat
    the 'set  aside'  as  agreed  by  consent  and  remit  the  matter  for
    consideration by another Upper Tribunal  Judge.   No  such  submissions
    having been received, Judge Juss's decision was accordingly  set  aside
    and the matter listed before myself on  the  24th  May  2019.  At  that
    hearing the Respondent was represented by Senior Presenting Officer  Mr
    Bates, and the Appellant by Mr Karnik of Counsel.


 5. Following that hearing I determined, by my written decision  dated  the
    26th May 2019, that the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge AR Hudson
    was defective for error of law and  it  was  set  aside  to  a  limited
    extent. My reasoning is replicated below under the  heading  'error  of
    law'.  At the resumed hearing I heard submissions from Mr  Diwnycz  and
    Mr Abraham and I reserved my decision, which  I  now  give,  under  the
    heading 'the re-made decision'.


    Accepted Facts

 6. Before I proceed to set out my findings it is appropriate that  I  mark
    those matters that are no longer in issue. Those are  that  during  the
    Ife-Modakeke conflict of 2000-01, the Appellant  was  violently  raped,
    and subjected to horrific assaults, by a number of men.  The First-tier
    Tribunal proceeded on the basis that this aspect of the claim is  true,
    and at the initial 'error of law' hearing Mr Bates accepted  on  behalf
    of the Secretary of State that this amounted to a positive  finding  of
    fact in the Appellant's favour.

 7. Her evidence about those events is that at the time she was  living  in
    her family home in Modakeke, a town  close  to  Ibadan  in  South  West
    Nigeria.  A local war had erupted  over  land  and  resources,  between
    Modakeke farmers and Ife militants, who presented  a  constant  threat.
    Lots of people lost their lives and many homes  were  burned  down.  In
    2000 the Appellant was approached by  a  police  officer,  subsequently
    joined by two colleagues, who  suggested  that  they  could  'keep  her
    family safe' if she agreed to have sexual intercourse with  them.   The
    implicit threat in this 'offer' was that  if  she  did  not  submit  to
    having sex, her parents and siblings would be in danger. The  Appellant
    accordingly agreed to have sex  with  these  three  officers.  She  was
    ordered to a house where  these  encounters  took  place  approximately
    three times per week for approximately three months.  If  she  did  not
    show up they would come looking for her. In her witness  statement  the
    Appellant says of this abuse: "I felt degraded  and  used.  I  came  to
    despise and distrust the police as a result".

 8. The abuse by these officers came to an end because the conflict arrived
    on the Appellant's doorstep:  "bullets  were  spraying  everywhere  and
    civilians were being killed". The Appellant found herself running  away
    from the gunfire along Famia  Road  with  members  of  her  family  and
    neighbours. In the chaos she became separated  from  them  as  she  run
    towards the bush. She realised that she was running alongside  a  group
    of men. The men told her to come with them to  a  farmhouse.  Once  she
    reached the farmhouse she realised that things were not right.  It  was
    isolated in the countryside, and  four  other  women  were  being  held
    there. The Appellant tried to run out but the men grabbed her and  made
    her kneel on the floor as they surrounded  her.  One  of  them  took  a
    dagger and placed the point under her chin, forcing her head back.  The
    dagger pierced her flesh and she still has a scar there today. The same
    man then heated the blade  in  the  fire  and  placed  it  between  the
    Appellant's breasts, causing her skin to burn: again  she  still  bears
    this scar. He told her "I am not playing". The Appellant  was  made  to
    kneel on the stony ground in the same position for  the  rest  of  that
    day. It became clear to her that she was held captive, with  the  other
    women, for the purpose of sexual exploitation.


 9. Altogether six men were involved. The Appellant, and the  other  women,
    were repeatedly raped and subjected to violence.  When  they  were  not
    being raped they were expected to cook and clean for the men  and  wash
    their clothes.  The Appellant now believes that the men were performing
    'black magic' rituals. Two of the captive women  had  had  their  heads
    closely shaved. One night one of these women was taken out by the  men;
    the other women heard her scream and then they did not see  her  again.
    The  following  day  they  saw   blood   in   the   farmyard   outside.
    Approximately two nights later the other lady with a  shaven  head  was
    taken out. As the Appellant and the two remaining  women  watched  from
    the window, the men beheaded the shaven-headed woman.

10. Some time later the men called one of the other  women.  When  she  was
    returned to the room her head and pubic hair had been  shaved  and  she
    was crying hysterically.  Then the men called the Appellant. She  tried
    to resist but was held down whilst her pubic hair  was  shaved  with  a
    knife. She felt a sharp pain between her legs and remembers  screaming.
    The next thing she knew the man who was assaulting her ran out  of  the
    room. The other men were calling him -  the  two  remaining  women  had
    escaped and were running away from the farmhouse.  The  men  all  start
    chasing  them.  The  Appellant  tried  to  stand  up  but  she  was  in
    excruciating pain. When she looked down  she  saw  that  she  had  been
    stabbed in the vagina and the knife was still  implanted  in  her.  She
    pulled out the blade and fled. She ran through the  bush  but  was  not
    pursued - the men had all headed after the other women. She  ran  until
    she reached a stream where some children were playing. She told them to
    fetch their mother and this lady came and helped her. She assisted  the
    Appellant by taking her to her uncle's home.   The Appellant was unable
    to describe to her uncle what had happened to her. She  knew,  and  was
    advised by her friend, that she should keep it  secret,  otherwise  she
    would be rejected by the  community  and  "would  struggle  to  find  a
    husband".


11. After the conflict had subsided and the Appellant had returned  to  her
    family home she tried to get on with her life: "I decided it  would  be
    best if I never spoke of my past again". She enrolled to study  nursing
    and in 2006 got married. She could not however escape her past. She now
    understands  that  she  was  deeply  traumatised.  She  suffered   from
    recurring  flashbacks,  severe  depression  and  insomnia.   The   most
    difficult symptom for her to try and mask was the bedwetting. At  night
    she would suffer from terrible nightmares and she would wake up  having
    wet the bed.   These problems led to tensions in her marriage and after
    the birth of her son in 2008 she confided  in  her  husband  about  the
    events in 2000. His attitude towards her immediately changed. He became
    very distant and betrayed her trust by  telling  other  people  in  the
    community. This made it worse  because  these  individuals  effectively
    blamed the Appellant herself, suggesting that she could have done  more
    to escape or avoid the assaults.  The Appellant's marriage  broke  down
    in 2011, and it was as a result of the attitudes she  was  facing  that
    the Appellant decided to come to the United Kingdom in study in 2012.

12.  It  is  the  Appellant's  case  that  she  continues  to  suffer   the
    psychological sequalae of these events today. The depression, insomnia,
    flashbacks and bedwetting continue to overshadow her  daily  existence.
    This too appears to have  been  accepted  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge, who  concluded  at  paragraph  20  of  the  determination  "this
    incident must have been wholly terrifying and would  almost  inevitably
    lead to some form of post traumatic shock for the victim".

13. These then are the accepted facts.


    Error of Law

14. The part of the  claim  that  was  not  accepted  was  the  Appellant's
    evidence that in 2016, whilst on trip home to visit her mother and son,
    the Appellant was once again subjected to sexual assault by a number of
    men.  She claimed that they accosted her in the street and taunted  her
    about her marriage to a white man in the United  Kingdom.   She  stated
    that these men  have  subsequently  visited  the  her  family  home  in
    Modakeke and assaulted and threatened her mother and son.   The  First-
    tier Tribunal rejected that evidence as  untrue,  and  having  done  so
    found there to be no current risk  to  the  Appellant  in  Nigeria.  It
    therefore rejected the appeal on both asylum and human rights  grounds.




15. The First-tier Tribunal had before it various items of medical evidence
    relating to the Appellant. For the purpose of this  decision  the  most
    significant  was  a  report  by  Consultant  Psychiatrist  Dr  Suneetha
    Kovvuri. Dr Kovvuri diagnosed the Appellant as suffering from PTSD with
    associated symptoms of anxiety and depression; as I note above  [at  my
    �12] this appears to  have  been  accepted  by  the  Tribunal  and  was
    consistent with its acceptance of the narrated events in 2000/2001.  Dr
    Kovvuri went on to state that in her view the Appellant was not fit  to
    give evidence. Although the Appellant had been able to  understand  the
    interview, and the consequences of her asylum claim failing, Dr Kovvuri
    was concerned that the Appellant's conditions were impeding her ability
    to accurately recall events:

         "[the Appellant] has learnt to block out some of her  memories,  in
         order to cope with the intensity of her pain. She informed  me,  as
         is also indicated by the records, that her recollection  of  events
         has posed a problem when she gave her  statement.  [The  Appellant]
         will also find it difficult to answer the questions as her  anxiety
         levels will increase  and  she  will  also  find  it  difficult  to
         recollect the dates and the events in correct chronological  order.
         This might offer the impression that she is not being  truthful  to
         the Court, when in fact this is not the case".


    Dr Kovvuri further  noted  her  own  observations  of  the  Appellant's
    tearfulness and upset  when  recalling  certain  events  and  expressed
    concern that if  asked  to  do  so  in  court,  this  would  cause  her
    psychological distress.

16. Before the First-tier  Tribunal  Counsel  for  the  Appellant  (not  Mr
    Karnik) had relied on the conclusions of Dr Kovvuri and had not  called
    the Appellant to give live evidence.


17. Of this decision the Tribunal had directed itself, at �12, that it  was
    the Appellant's "right" not to give evidence, but  records  the  advice
    given to the Appellant and her Counsel at hearing, that "the weight  of
    the evidence within the bundles may be affected by the  fact  it  could
    not be tested in cross-examination" [�8] and "the Respondent  has  been
    denied the opportunity to cross-examine her" [�12]. The  Tribunal  went
    on to draw two adverse conclusions about the medical evidence  and  the
    submission that the Appellant was 'not fit' to give evidence. The first
    is that the Tribunal did not accept the Appellant's  "assertions  about
    the  level  of  her  vulnerability"  [�25].  The  second  is  that  the
    discrepancies in the account "are not explained by  any  depression  or
    PTSD" [�26].

18. The Appellant's first ground of appeal was that these findings were not
    open to the First-tier Tribunal and that the Tribunal erred in  law  by
    failing to apply the guidance,  binding upon the  Tribunal  and  placed
    before it, in the Joint Presidential Guidance Note No 2 of 2010: Child,
    vulnerable adult and sensitive  appellant  guidance  ("the  Guidance").
    Reliance was further placed on the guidance in AM  (Afghanistan).  Both
    the  Guidance  and  AM  require  Tribunals  to  take   procedural   and
    substantive steps to ensuring that vulnerable appellants  have  a  fair
    hearing, and that their evidence is properly assessed in light of their
    vulnerabilities. In particular Mr Karnik submitted  that  the  Tribunal
    was required to:

              i) state on the face of its decision whether it  accepted  the
                 Appellant was in fact a vulnerable witness;
             ii) ensure that the Appellant had a fair hearing; and
            iii)  ensure  that  the  Appellant's  voice  was  heard  in  the
                 proceedings.


19. As to (i) Mr Karnik took me to paragraph 15 of the Guidance:


         15.The decision should record whether the  Tribunal  has  concluded
         the appellant (or a witness) is a child, vulnerable  or  sensitive,
         the effect the Tribunal considered the identified vulnerability had
         in assessing the evidence before it and thus whether  the  Tribunal
         was satisfied whether the appellant had established his or her case
         to the relevant standard of proof. In asylum appeals, weight should
         be given to objective indications of risk rather  than  necessarily
         to a state of mind.


    He submitted that the findings  in  the  determination  are  equivocal.
    Nowhere does the Tribunal state whether or  not  it  accepts  that  the
    Appellant is vulnerable. This was a significant failure because it  led
    to the second and third.


20. As to (ii) and (iii) Mr Karnik submitted that the  Tribunal  failed  to
    make allowance for the fact that  the  Appellant  was  unable  to  give
    evidence, either by way of introducing procedural safeguards to  ensure
    a fair trial, or by properly reading her written evidence.


21.  At  paragraph  15  of  the  determination  the  Tribunal  begins   its
    consideration of the issue as follows:


         "I have seen a letter dated  13th  June  2018  asserting  that  the
         appellant 'has been identified as vulnerable' and  therefore  would
         not be giving evidence...".


    There  then  follows  a  lengthy  examination  of   the   circumstances
    surrounding the Appellant and  her  case  until  at  �25  the  Tribunal
    concludes "I'm afraid that I do not accept [the Appellant's] assertions
    of the level of her vulnerability".

22. On one reading it could be said that this reasoning was equivocal.  The
    Tribunal had already accepted that the Appellant had  been  subject  to
    horrifying trauma and that she suffers from PTSD  as  a  result.   This
    would most certainly place her in the category  of  'vulnerable':   see
    footnote 2 of the Guidance "some individuals are vulnerable because  of
    what has happened to them eg they are victims of  trafficking  or  have
    sustained serious harm or torture or are suffering from PTSD".   Having
    accepted that evidence it certainly could be  said  that  the  Tribunal
    should have stated with clarity: "the Appellant is vulnerable".


23. That said, it is I think implicit from the reasoning that the  Tribunal
    accepts that she is.  When the Tribunal concludes [at �25] "I'm  afraid
    that I do not accept [the Appellant's] assertions of the level  of  her
    vulnerability" that is  a finding entirely consistent with the Guidance
    itself, which specifically  directs  that  decision-makers  assess  the
    level of vulnerability: "It is a matter for you to determine the extent
    of an identified vulnerability" [at �3 of the Guidance]. The conclusion
    is supported by detailed reasoning: the  determination  contrasts,  for
    instance, the claim that the Appellant is terrified  of  men  with  the
    fact that the Appellant has been able to work and support  herself  for
    many years, in public  roles  necessarily  involving  interaction  with
    strange men.  I do not accept therefore that  the  Tribunal  failed  to
    direct itself to the guidance, to the suggestion that the Appellant was
    vulnerable, or  to  the  implications  of  that.  It  did  not  draw  a
    conclusion with which Mr Karnik agrees, but that is  not  an  error  of
    law.


24. Nor am I satisfied that the First-tier  Tribunal  can  legitimately  be
    criticised for its approach to the hearing itself. Mr Karnik again took
    me to the Guidance and to the Court of Appeal decision in AM, to submit
    that it was for the Tribunal to ensure that the Appellant was  able  to
    participate in the hearing, for instance  by  intervening  or  managing
    cross-examination.  This was an Appellant  who  had  experienced  legal
    Counsel  and  specialist  immigration  solicitors   representing   her.
    Together they took the decision that she would not be  called  to  give
    evidence. They did not make any special requests  to  the  Tribunal  to
    facilitate her giving live evidence or otherwise participating  in  the
    hearing beyond simply observing it; no doubt properly acting on medical
    evidence they simply decided that she would not be called. I am unclear
    on what, in those circumstances, the Judge  might  be  expected  to  do
    other than explain the procedure to the Appellant, which she apparently
    did. At that  point  there  was  no  scope  for  the  co-operative  and
    collaborative decision-making procedure recommended in AM, and  I  note
    that at case  management  stage  no  request  had  been  made  for  the
    Appellant to be treated as a vulnerable witness.


25. I am however satisfied that at least one of the criticisms  under  this
    head of challenge  is  made  out.   That  is  that  Mr  Karnik's  third
    complaint, that the Tribunal has not done  enough  to  ensure,  in  the
    absence of live evidence, that the Appellant's 'voice was heard'.   Put
    simply, that ambition could have been served in this case  by  properly
    reading the written evidence, and if omissions  were  there  found,  by
    giving the Appellant an  opportunity,  post-hearing  if  necessary,  to
    comment or expand upon her evidence. That this did not  occur  in  this
    case can be illustrated with reference to these adverse conclusions  in
    the determination:

              i)  At  paragraph  24  the  determination  contrasts   written
                 evidence supplied in  affidavit  form  by  the  Appellant's
                 mother (that both she and  the  Appellant's  son  had  been
                 beaten by men who came to their home) with the  Appellant's
                 asylum interview where she says it was just her mother  who
                 was assaulted. Here the Tribunal failed to have  regard  to
                 the  fact  that  immediately  after   the   interview   the
                 Appellant's solicitor had written to amend  the  record  to
                 state that the child had been also been assaulted (in  fact
                 other issues had arisen at interview with  the  interviewer
                 finding it difficult to follow the Appellant's accent);


             ii) At paragraph 23 the Tribunal draws adverse  inference  from
                 the Appellant's failure to report the 2016 to  the  police,
                 without having any regard to her written evidence that  she
                 distrusted and feared the police (or  indeed  the  accepted
                 evidence that she had been raped by three  police  officers
                 over an extended period in 2000);

            iii) At paragraph 22  the  Tribunal  finds  that  the  Appellant
                 failed to  mention  the  2016  incident  at  her  screening
                 interview. This is incorrect, as the attack itself, as well
                 as the context involving the discovery that  the  Appellant
                 had married a white man and so was a "fake" Muslim, are all
                 recorded in that interview. The 2016 incident is  mentioned
                 at in the Appellant's responses to  2.5  ("during  my  last
                 travels there was one incident in April  2006"  (sic))  and
                 4.1 ("My son was ill. I took photos from my wedding and  my
                 mum took them to get enlarged and people saw I was  married
                 to a white man and called me a fake Muslim.  They  said  my
                 head wasn't covered. My mum displayed it. I take  walks  at
                 night and I was raped").

26. The Tribunal is always under an  obligation  to  assess  with  "anxious
    scrutiny" the evidence in protection cases, but where an  applicant  is
    unable - or even just reluctant - to give evidence because she  is  too
    distressed and psychologically unwell to do so,  the  written  material
    will inevitably assume even greater significance. I accept that here it
    is not clear that the Tribunal has read and given full account  to  the
    'rebuttal' statement signed  by  the  Appellant,  nor  in  the  matters
    identified  above,  read  with  the  appropriate  level  of  care   the
    Appellant's interview records or  the  correspondence  which  followed.
    This brings me to the second ground.


27. It is submitted on behalf of the Appellant that the  reasons  given  by
    the First-tier Tribunal for rejecting the account of the  2016  assault
    are inadequate and unsustainable in  law.   As  to  the  findings  that
    aspects of the account were implausible, reliance is  placed  on  HK  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2006] EWCA Civ 1037:


         Inherent improbability in the context of asylum cases was discussed
         at some length by Lord Brodie  in  Awala  -v-  Secretary  of  State
         [2005] CSOH 73. At paragraph 22, he pointed out that  it  was  "not
         proper to reject an applicant's account merely on the basis that it
         is not credible or  not  plausible.  To  say  that  an  applicant's
         account is not credible is to state a conclusion" (emphasis added).
         At paragraph 24, he said that rejection of a story  on  grounds  of
         implausibility must be done "on reasonably drawn inferences and not
         simply on conjecture or speculation". He went on to  emphasise,  as
         did Pill LJ in Ghaisari, the entitlement of the fact-finder to rely
         "on his common sense and his ability, as a practical  and  informed
         person, to identify what is  or  is  not  plausible".  However,  he
         accepted that "there will be cases where actions which  may  appear
         implausible if judged by...Scottish standards, might  be  plausible
         when considered within the context of the  applicant's  social  and
         cultural background".


28. It is trite asylum law that judges in this jurisdiction should be  slow
    to assess  the  actions  of  others  through  the  lens  of  their  own
    understanding. What may be regarded as normal or rational behaviour  in
    one  country  or  social  group  may  be  regarded   as   bizarre   and
    unexplainable in another and vice versa.  In this case,  for  instance,
    the Judge had rejected as "unlikely" the evidence  that  the  Appellant
    would walk on her own at night in Nigeria without having regard to  the
    fact that in countries where daytime temperatures are very high  it  is
    common for the streets to be full of people late into the evening.  The
    Judge further found it implausible that the  Appellant's  mother  would
    want to enlarge and display photographs of the Appellant's  wedding  to
    her white husband without taking into account the fact  that  it  is  a
    cultural norm to display large family portraits, and to weigh  this  in
    the balance when considering whether hostility from what appeared to be
    a very small group of the local population would prevent her from doing
    this.   For my own part I did not find any of the matters identified as
    "unlikely" at paragraphs  22-23  to  be  inherently  implausible;  that
    perhaps illustrates the dangers inherent in such subjective assessment,
    as elucidated by Lord Justice Neuberger in HK.


29. There are other reasons given in the determination. At paragraph 26 the
    determination finds there to be "many" inconsistencies in the  account,
    concluding "I'm afraid that such discrepancies are not explained by any
    depression or PTSD".  Without  wishing  to  return  in  detail  to  the
    submissions made under ground (i), this seems to me  to  entirely  miss
    the point made in the medical report by Dr Kovvuri. The  point  broadly
    made therein is that the  narrative  of  an  individual  suffering  the
    profound psychological sequalae of violent and atrocious persecution is
    likely to be a bit hard to follow.   It may change in emphasis  between
    each telling, or include details entirely omitted previously.  That  is
    the nature of human recollection, its  frailties  further  weakened  by
    trauma.

30. At paragraph 26 the determination identifies three  discrepancies.  One
    is that refugee support group RASA recorded that the men who  assaulted
    in the Appellant in 2016 wanted to blackmail her for financial gain.  I
    note that this is not of course inconsistent with them having  targeted
    her because she was  married  to  a  European,  but  Mr  Karnik's  real
    complaint was that the Appellant was  not  asked  to  comment  on  this
    apparent 'inconsistency'. Similarly, the Tribunal identifies  that  the
    Appellant has given two reasons why her  second  marriage  broke  down;
    first that she and her husband had argued over whether she should bring
    her son to the United Kingdom, and second because of domestic violence.
    Again, it is difficult to  see  that  this  necessarily  amounts  to  a
    discrepancy at all; it is perfectly possible that both were  true.  The
    determination also records that  her  GP  believed  that  in  the  2000
    abduction the Appellant was forced to work as a cook in an "Army camp";
    whilst it could be said on the facts that this was  a  misunderstanding
    easily explained (it was a war, she was abducted by a  group  of  armed
    men and forced to work for them),  it  was  also  entirely  irrelevant,
    given  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  already   accepted   that   the
    Appellant's account of events in 2000-01 was true.


31. That being the case, the  adverse  findings  in  respect  of  the  2016
    incident boil  down  to  two  'discrepancies'  that  are  arguably  not
    discrepancies at all, and the Tribunal's own assessment of whether  the
    account is inherently implausible.  I am satisfied that these  findings
    are not a sustainable basis  for  rejecting  this  claim,  particularly
    given the medical evidence and the fact that much  of  the  Appellant's
    account had already been accepted.

32. In his submissions Mr Bates  made  the  very  good  point  that  it  is
    arguable that any error identified in the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal is immaterial. Although the Secretary of State  accepted  that
    the Appellant is a 'member of a particular social group', namely  women
    in Nigeria, it is not clear what the  ongoing  risk  would  be  if  the
    Appellant were to be returned there today.  Presumably it is not  being
    argued that the level of sexual violence is  such  that  any  woman  in
    Nigeria faces a real risk of serious harm at any given time.  Mr  Bates
    made a further good point  in  that  the  Tribunal  did  make  'in  the
    alternative' findings on  internal  flight  at  its  �27,  and  at  �30
    addressed Article 8.   I therefore gave careful consideration to  those
    matters and to whether  the  errors  in  approach  established  by  the
    grounds are such that the decision must be set aside.


33. Bearing in mind that this is a protection claim, and  that  this  is  a
    woman who has been accepted to have significant  mental  health  issues
    arising from terrible and brutal assaults, I concluded  that  it  would
    not be appropriate to dismiss her appeal on the basis  advanced  by  Mr
    Bates.  The  errors  of  law  go  to  the  overall  assessment  of  the
    Appellant's credibility, and that formed the background to any  forward
    looking risk assessment, including  any  internal  flight  alternative.
    It is important that findings are made on the 2016 incident so that the
    Appellant's ability to  return  to  Modakeke  could  be  assessed;  any
    analysis of whether it would be 'reasonable' to expect her to  relocate
    within Nigeria would similarly be subject to whether that  incident  is
    proven. For that reason I set the decision aside and  directed  that  I
    would remake the decision in the appeal on these matters.   This  would
    necessarily involve me making my  own  assessment  of  the  Appellant's
    vulnerability: whilst the Tribunal was entitled to reach the conclusion
    that it did about the extent of her vulnerability, in  remaking  I  too
    will be entitled to reach my own conclusions.



    The Re-Made Decision

34. At the resumed hearing Mr Abraham informed the court that the Appellant
    would not be giving evidence. She came into the hearing  room  to  hear
    submissions but with permission left when  the  subject  matter  became
    distressing for her.


35. The parties agreed that following the 'error  of  law'  decision  there
    were three issues for me to determine:


              i) Did the Appellant  and  members  of  her  family  encounter
                 persecution in 2016?


             ii) Is she at risk in her home area of Modakeke today?


            iii) If the answer to (ii)  is  in  the  affirmative,  would  it
                 nevertheless be reasonable to expect her to relocate within
                 Nigeria.


36. As a preface to all of that I should begin  by  considering  whether  I
    accept that the Appellant is a vulnerable person and if so  the  extent
    of her vulnerability.  As a postscript I may also consider whether  the
    Appellant would be entitled to leave to remain in the United Kingdom on
    human rights grounds, although I note that neither party made  discrete
    oral submissions on this issue.


    The Appellant


37. Dr Kovvuri's report is dated the 10th April  2018.    She  has  been  a
    Consultant  Psychiatrist  since  2008.  No  issue  is  taken  with  her
    expertise, nor with the contents of her report.  Her  central  findings
    are that the Appellant:


         . Suffers from PTSD, depression and chronic levels of anxiety;
         . Has symptoms including loss of appetite, nightmares, flashbacks,
           bedwetting and insomnia (she sleeps no more than five hours  per
           night)
         . Suffers from such severe anxiety that she is at a high  risk  of
           suicide;
         . Will, without  appropriate  treatment  in  a  safe  environment,
           suffer a continuing deterioration of her mental health.


38. Dr Kovvuri's assessment took place in April 2018.  At  that  point  the
    Appellant had been in psychological counselling for  approximately  six
    months, and had  been  prescribed  maximum  dose  anti-depressants  for
    approximately 2 years.   The most up to  date  medical  evidence  is  a
    letter written in July 2019 from  Minds  Matter,  a  talking  therapies
    service run by Lancashire Care NHS Foundation  Trust,  confirming  that
    the Appellant has more recently been referred for CBT.   She  continues
    to take anti-depressants.


39. I accept, as did the  First-tier  Tribunal,  that  the  Appellant  does
    suffer from the sequalae of  trauma  in  the  manner  described  by  Dr
    Kovvuri. The issue that concerned the First-tier Tribunal was  to  what
    extent the Appellant may be  exaggerating  her  symptoms  in  order  to
    strengthen her protection / human rights claim. The Tribunal noted, for
    instance, that the Appellant has been able to pursue her studies so  as
    to qualify as a nurse, and has managed to get married and  undertake  a
    public facing  role  involving  interacting  with  strange  men.  These
    features of  the  evidence  led  the  Tribunal  to  conclude  that  the
    Appellant was not in quite as bad a state as she claimed.

40. I have given careful consideration to that matter. So did  Dr  Kovvuri,
    who appears to have explored the Appellant's personal history, post the
    events of 2000, in some detail. What is apparent from that  history  is
    that the Appellant has had periods where she is able to  function,  and
    has managed to get on with her life, and others where  she  has  really
    struggled. For instance the Appellant told Dr Kovvuri that when she was
    training to be a nurse in the years immediately following the Modakeke-
    Ife conflict she found it very difficult to concentrate, and  that  she
    failed a number of modules as a result. She was required to resit exams
    so that the course took 4 years instead of the expected 3.  During that
    period she was living  alone  and  started  to  suffer  nightmares  and
    bedwetting - she had wet herself during the incident where she  escaped
    the men in the farmhouse  and  she  believes  the  two  matters  to  be
    connected. She could not watch the news because the sight of armed  men
    would induce panic attacks. After a particularly difficult episode  she
    would find herself unable to engage with those around  her  for  a  few
    days. As a result she made  few  friends  at  university  and  isolated
    herself.   This was a particularly bad  period.  Conversely  after  the
    Appellant found her first job she felt that her situation had improved.
    She started to feel better because she liked her work and it  gave  her
    self-respect.  These periods of 'ups' and  'downs'  have  characterised
    the last 19 years for the Appellant. Two marriages and the birth of her
    son gave her some semblance of normality, but both of  those  marriages
    broke down in large part because of her mental health issues,  and  she
    has left her son behind because she does  not  feel  safe  in  Nigeria.
    Having had regard to all of  the  detailed  evidence  in  Dr  Kovvuri's
    report, and the Appellant's own statements, I am of the  view  that  it
    would be overly simplistic to assume that the  Appellant's  ability  to
    function 'normally' in society is any indication that she is  well,  or
    psychologically recovered from her ordeals.


41. I further note that in accordance with the Istanbul Protocol Dr Kovvuri
    has recorded her own clinical  observations  made  when  assessing  the
    Appellant. Whilst the Appellant was  generally  able  to  maintain  eye
    contact and give a clear account,    when  asked  to  speak  about  the
    assaults she has suffered  the  Appellant  became  visibly  distressed,
    crying and unable  to  look  at  Dr  Kovvuri.  I  note  that  this  was
    consistent with the Appellant's behaviour during  the  hearing  in  the
    Upper Tribunal.

42. Having taken all of that evidence into account I am satisfied that  the
    Appellant is a vulnerable witness because she is a survivor of  serious
    harm who is suffering from PTSD. She continues to receive treatment and
    the uncontradicted medical opinion is that it would be distressing  and
    difficult for her to give evidence; in fact Dr Kovvuri did not consider
    her fit to  give  evidence.  I  am  satisfied  that  the  Appellant  is
    extremely vulnerable and that this should be taken  into  account  when
    approaching her appeal; in particular no adverse  inference  should  be
    drawn from her decision not to give evidence.


    2016


43. The account  itself  is  a  fairly  straightforward  one.   It  is  the
    Appellant's evidence that in April 2016  she  returned  to  Nigeria  to
    visit her mother and son. Although she was  having  problems  with  her
    second husband by that time, she did not tell her mother  this  because
    it had taken her mother some time to accept that she had married in the
    United Kingdom and she did not want  to  distress  her.  The  Appellant
    brought with her some  photographs  of  her  wedding.  The  Appellant's
    mother was happy to see these photographs and took them  to  the  local
    photo shop to get copies for herself. I have been shown copies of these
    photographs. The Appellant is depicted in a white wedding dress and one
    shows her signing the register with her then  husband.  They  are  both
    happy and smiling.  The Appellant's head  is  uncovered  and  there  is
    nothing obvious in the pictures to indicate that she is Muslim.


44. It is the Appellant's evidence  that  one  evening  shortly  after  her
    mother visited the photo shop she was walking in the  neighbourhood.  A
    group of men - possibly as many as eight - approached her. They started
    to verbally abuse her. They taunted her and said that she was a  'fake'
    Muslim, and they knew that she did not wear a headscarf  when  she  was
    with her white husband. The Appellant surmised from this that they  had
    seen the photos that her mother had taken to the print shop.   The  men
    dragged her into a secluded spot and raped her. One of them ripped  her
    headscarf from her head, and repeatedly admonished her for not being  a
    proper Muslim.   She heard some of them talking about how they might be
    able to get money out of her.

45. The Appellant did not report the incident to the police because she was
    traumatised and ashamed. Nor, because of her previous experiences,  did
    she trust the police.  She  made  arrangements  to  leave  Nigeria  and
    returned to the United  Kingdom.   When  she  got  back  here  she  was
    detained because her EEA national husband had withdrawn his sponsorship
    of her family permit. It was whilst she was in detention that her spoke
    with her mother, who informed her  that  men  had  come  to  the  house
    looking for her. They had pushed and threatened her mother. It was only
    after her release from detention that  her  mother  informed  her  that
    these men had also assaulted her son.

46. The account is consonant  with  the  country  background  material.  Mr
    Abraham took me to a good deal of evidence demonstrating that rape  and
    other sexual assaults on women  are  depressingly  frequent  events  in
    Nigeria. I need not set out that evidence in  any  great  detail  since
    none of it is contested, but it suffices to note that the Secretary  of
    State accepts that the account of events in 2016 is plausible in  light
    of the country material.

47. The Secretary of State does not however  accept  that  the  account  is
    internally consistent. In her asylum interview,  conducted  in  January
    2017, the Appellant told the officer  that  a  friend  in  Nigeria  had
    advised her mother to go to the court and set out her account  of  what
    happened in May 2016 when some men visited her home. This  account  was
    produced in affidavit form and given to the officer at  the  interview.
    The Secretary  of  State's  assessment  of  that  document  appears  at
    paragraph 52 of the 'reasons for refusal' letter:

         "The affidavit does not  reflect  what  happened  that  night.  You
         firstly claimed that it was while you were outside the property, as
         it was too hot  (AIR  Q177).  The  affidavit  alleges  that  7  men
         "forcefully entered the  house  with  some  weapons,  guns,  dagger
         (sic), knives (Annex B)". The affidavit also mentions a  threat  of
         beheading, which you did not  mention  in  your  asylum  interview.
         There is also an inconsistency with the  legitimacy  of  the  date.
         When asked about the date, instead of giving  the  date,  you  just
         referred to the affidavit, in case you made an error on  the  date.
         You did, when asked again, state that it was the 17 May  2016  (AIR
         Q8-10). This is the date on the affidavit, however,  quite  clearly
         on the affidavit, a written statement of fact voluntarily  made  by
         an affiant or deponent under and oath or  affirmation  administered
         by a person authorized to do so by law, a mark in ink from  a  biro
         or equivalent pen has put a '1' in front of the 7, thus  making  17
         May 2016. The date you have supplied both in the affidavit and your
         asylum interview is inconsistent with the fact you  claimed  asylum
         in the United Kingdom on the 15 May 2016 (SCR 3.3)"


48. Although I regret to use  the  phrase,  this  paragraph  requires  some
    unpacking. First, neither party before me was able to produce a copy of
    the affidavit that the Appellant submitted  at  her  interview.  It  is
    accepted that such a thing existed, produced after her  mother  visited
    the court in Modakeke to record her version  of  events  in  May  2016.
    There is, in my home office bundle, no 'annex B'  and  Mr  Diwnycz  was
    unable to find anything on the Home Office file. Second, it is apparent
    from the reasoning that the officer had conflated the incident in which
    the Appellant herself was attacked after taking a walk at night - which
    on her evidence occurred in April 2016 -  with  the  incident  where  a
    group of armed men presented themselves at her family home  and  forced
    entry - said to have occurred on the 17th May, after the Appellant  had
    left Nigeria. The references to the asylum interview - and indeed  that
    whole record  - demonstrate that the Appellant  clearly  describes  two
    distinct  incidents.   This  error  is  obviously  fundamental  to  the
    Secretary of State's assessment of the Appellant's credibility on  this
    point.  Third,  the  decision  maker  appears  to  draw  some  negative
    inference from the fact that the Appellant hesitated  to  identify  the
    date of an event that she was not party to -  I  am  unsure  what  that
    might show  other  than  that  the  Appellant  did  not  want  to  give
    inaccurate information.  Fourth  the  officer  further  draws  negative
    inference from the fact that the document had been amended by  hand.  I
    am unable to say whether that in itself is suspicious but at first hand
    it is difficult to say why it might be - if the account  was  invention
    the Appellant could just as easily have stuck with the date of the  7th
    May.   I am not persuaded that any of this  reasoning  in  the  refusal
    letter is cogent.


49. Having read her interview and statements with care I am satisfied  that
    the Appellant's account of the two events has been largely  consistent.
    In relation to the first - the attack on her - it is right to say  that
    the Appellant did not, on each telling, reveal each  and  every  detail
    about the ordeal. Had she done so that would, in the circumstances,  be
    extremely surprising. In relation to the second, she was not there, and
    has offered only what information she herself has been given.   I  find
    there to be nothing  implausible  in  the  account.  There  is  nothing
    implausible in the Appellant wishing to show  her  mother  her  wedding
    photographs and keep her under the impression that her  marriage  is  a
    good one. Nor is there anything implausible in the  Appellant's  mother
    wanting copies of these photographs of  her  daughter  in  her  wedding
    dress. In a small town in rural Nigeria  it  is  entirely  unsurprising
    that someone other than the individual who took receipt of  the  photos
    in the print shop got to see or hear about them. The men  who  attacked
    her appear to have been motivated by a mixture of  things:  anger  that
    she has 'betrayed her religion', perhaps anger that she has  'betrayed'
    men in Modakeke by marrying out, poverty and greed.  None  of  that  is
    implausible.

50. Applying the lower standard of proof I am satisfied that the account of
    events in 2016 is true.   I  therefore  find  that  in  three  separate
    incidents the Appellant has been subjected to  serious  persecution  in
    Nigeria for reasons of  her  gender.  In  2000  she  was  subjected  to
    repeated rape and sexual exploitation by three police officers. Shortly
    after that she was abducted and held in brutal sexual  servitude  where
    she witnesses horrifying scenes of other women being murdered. She left
    Nigeria because the latter event became known in her community and  her
    trauma was exacerbated by shame and stigma.  When she returned in  2016
    to visit her family she was then again  subject  to  a  serious  sexual
    assault.



    Current Risk


51. Paragraph 339K of the Immigration Rules provides:


         339K. The fact that a person has already been subject to
         persecution or serious harm, or to direct threats of such
         persecution or such harm, will be regarded as a serious indication
         of the person's well-founded fear of persecution or real risk of
         suffering serious harm, unless there are good reasons to consider
         that such persecution or serious harm will not be repeated.


52. The effect of this Demirkaya presumption[1] in this case is that I must
    assess whether there are good reasons to consider that if  returned  to
    Modakeke the Appellant would not face a real risk of harm from the  men
    who attacked her in 2016.


53. There is no evidence that anything  has  happened  to  the  Appellant's
    mother or son since the attack on the family home  in  May  2016.  Nor,
    however, is there any evidence to indicate that the  men  who  attacked
    the Appellant have left the town, or have suffered any consequences  of
    her mother reporting the matter to the  authorities:  had  some  action
    been taken, I would have expected the Appellant's mother to  have  been
    informed. The risk faced by the Appellant must be assessed in light  of
    that incident. These men became aware of her return  to  Modakeke,  and
    her circumstances, within a couple of weeks of  her  arrival  there  in
    2016. There is no good reason to consider that they  would  not  do  so
    again. Mr Diwnycz was not able to point to any  information  indicating
    that the situation on the ground may have changed. There have  not  for
    instance, to my knowledge, been  any  meaningful  improvements  in  the
    state prosecution of rapists, or assistance  for  their  victims.   The
    Appellant still lives in the United Kingdom, and as far  as  anyone  in
    Modakeke is aware, is still married to a white man.  There is no reason
    to believe that the  motivations  of  the  Appellant's  attackers  have
    changed.   In view of that I am satisfied that there  is  a  real  risk
    that if she returned to Modakeke the Appellant would once again  become
    the target of these men.


54. I must now consider whether there would be a sufficiency of  protection
    from any future assault. This is a woman who has been subject to  three
    terrible and significant periods of sexual abuse. The  first  of  these
    was perpetrated by three police officers. Her  reluctance  to  approach
    the police is therefore understandable:  Souad  Noune  v  Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department [2000] EWCA Civ 306. Her suspicions would
    appear to be well-founded. In the Home Office Country  Information  and
    Guidance Note Nigeria: Women  fearing  gender-based  harm  or  violence
    (Version 3.0, published August  2016)  the  Respondent  cites  research
    conducted by the Canadian Immigration and Refugee  Board  about  police
    attitudes [at 5.1.1]:

         'In correspondence with  the  Research  Directorate,  the  National
         Program Coordinator of the Network  on  Police  Reform  in  Nigeria
         (NOPRIN), a network of 46 civil society  organizations  working  on
         police accountability and human rights in Nigeria (n.d.), indicated
         that police "characteristically  exhibit  bias  and  discriminatory
         attitudes in their treatment of female victims of  violence"  which
         is "informed by cultural beliefs  and  notions  which  devalue  and
         subjugate women," and often "blame  the  victim"  (NOPRIN  11  Oct.
         2014)....'

55. And at [2.3.6]:


         Rape is widespread. Societal pressure  and  the  stigma  associated
         with rape reduce the percentage of rapes reported and the penalties
         imposed on conviction. Sentences for persons convicted of rape  and
         sexual assault were inconsistent and often minor. Security services
         committed rape and other forms of violence against women and  girls
         largely  with  impunity.  Women  detained  for  criminal  offences,
         relatives of criminal suspects  and  sex  workers  who  cannot  pay
         bribes are often targeted  for  rape  and  other  abuse  by  police
         officers...


56. Against this background the CPIN reproduces a shocking statistic  cited
    by Mr Abraham: that as of 2016 there have only ever been 18  successful
    prosecutions for rape  in  the  country's  legal  history  [at  6.3.3].
    Whilst there may be laws in place  against  sexual  violence,  and  the
    government may be taking measures to support victims  of  such  crimes,
    the CPIN acknowledges that such laws are often not implemented [see for
    instance 2.4.1]. In light of this country background material, and  the
    Appellant's personal history, I cannot be satisfied that there would be
    for her a sufficiency of protection in Nigeria.






    Internal Flight


57. Mr Diwnycz submitted that there is, in general, a freedom  of  movement
    in Nigeria, and that women are  able  to  move  without  legal  or  any
    significant social restriction around  the  country.  He  acknowledged,
    however, that the Appellant's ability to do so had to  be  analysed  in
    light of her own personal characteristics and history.


58. I think, in light of what is set out above, that I can be brief.    The
    internal flight alternative exists  in  refugee  law  to  protect  host
    countries from spurious claims. Where an individual can  reasonably  be
    expected to avoid localised harm by simply moving to  another  part  of
    his own country, there is no obligation in international law for a host
    country to accept his claim. This principle, as  it  has  developed  in
    this country, requires decision makers to consider whether it would  be
    reasonable,  in  all  the  circumstances,  to  expect  the   individual
    concerned to internally relocate. Put another way, would to  do  so  be
    'unduly harsh'?  This is a woman who has been brutally  and  repeatedly
    raped by three distinct sets of men in Nigeria, one of whom was a group
    of  police  officers.  She  continues   to   suffer   the   significant
    psychological sequalae of those events. The unchallenged evidence of  a
    consultant psychiatrist is that she is unlikely to  get  better  unless
    she receives meaningful mental health treatment in an  environment  she
    regards as safe. The Appellant does not regard  Nigeria  as  safe.   So
    whilst the Appellant may be able to find work as a nurse, pay  her  own
    way and find accommodation,  I am far from satisfied that it  would  be
    reasonable to expect her to do so. Living alone  in  Nigeria  would  be
    extremely  frightening  and  disturbing  for  her.  That  psychological
    pressure upon her would be immense, and in all the circumstances  would
    be unduly harsh.


59. It follows that the Appellant's  appeal  is  allowed  on  human  rights
    grounds.



    Human Rights


60. Neither party made oral submissions on human rights other than to point
    out that an Article 3 claim would stand and fall  with  the  protection
    claim. I would simply add that in respect of  Article  8  the  evidence
    strongly indicates that removal  would  amount  to  a  disproportionate
    interference with the  Appellant's  established  private  life  in  the
    United Kingdom,  including her relationships  with  the  mental  health
    professionals who have treated her thus far. To expect her to return to
    the scene of her  abuse  would  in  my  view  be  disproportionate  and
    unjustifiably harsh.










    Anonymity

61. The Appellant is accepted to be a survivor of  serious  sexual  assault
    with significant mental  health  problems.  As  such  I  am  satisfied,
    having had regard to the guidance in the Presidential Guidance Note  No
    1 of 2013: Anonymity Orders, that it would be appropriate  to  make  an
    order in accordance with Rule  14  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
    Tribunal) Rules 2008 in the following terms:


        "Unless and until  a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
        Appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
        shall directly or indirectly identify her  or  any  member  of  her
        family.  This  direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  both  the
        Appellant  and  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with   this
        direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"




    Decisions


62. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains material errors of law
    and it is set aside.


63. I re-make the decision in the appeal as follows:


    'the appeal is allowed on protection and human rights grounds'.


64. There is an order for anonymity.
