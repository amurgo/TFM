For the Appellant:     Mr Greg ï¿½ Ceallaigh, Counsel instructed by Samars
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms A Everett, Specialist Appeals Team


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the rehearing of the appellant's appeal against the decision by
    the Secretary of State to refuse to grant him leave to  remain  as  the
    spouse of a person present and settled here, by reference to  paragraph
    353 of HC 395 (as amended), and to make directions for his removal from
    the United Kingdom as an overstayer.  The First-tier Tribunal  did  not
    make an anonymity direction,  and  I  do  not  consider  the  appellant
    requires to be accorded anonymity for these proceedings  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

 2. The appellant is a national of India, who was born on 7  January  1979.
    He came to the United Kingdom as a visitor in 2004 and later varied his
    leave to remain as a dependant of his then wife,  a  Russian  national.
    According to Home Office records, his leave to remain in this  capacity
    expired on 5 May 2009, and  he  became  an  overstayer.   A  subsequent
    application for leave to remain on private life grounds made in January
    2011 was refused with no right of appeal on 9 March 2011.

 3. In October 2012 the appellant applied through  his  current  solicitors
    for leave to remain on the basis of his relationship with Ms P.   In  a
    covering letter dated 28 September 2012, the  solicitors  set  out  the
    facts upon which the appellant relied.

 4. After completing his A levels in India in 1997, he had left for  Russia
    in 1999 on a work permit to work in his  paternal  uncle's  large-scale
    business in Moscow.  In or about January 2001 he met  a  young  Russian
    woman who was very interested in Sikhism. They had got married, and  he
    had subsequently entered the UK as her dependant spouse.  Following his
    separation from his first wife in or  about  2008,  the  appellant  had
    established himself in the UK as a  businessman.   Before  his  spousal
    leave to remain expired on 30 May 2009, he made  an  application  as  a
    Highly Skilled Migrant under the points-based system.  His  application
    was unsuccessful as he was not allowed to apply for HSMP within the  UK
    as he had initially entered the country as a dependant of his wife.  He
    appealed against the refusal decision, but his appeal was unsuccessful.
     Thereafter he made an application for private life grounds outside the
    Rules, and this application was refused on 9 June 2009.

 5. The appellant was the director of two businesses, namely Veer Jewellers
    Limited, which was established in 2009 and Glitters UK  Limited,  which
    was established in 2008.  He had never been a burden on the  state  and
    had contributed his fair share to the British economy.

 6. In about February 2012 he met Ms P at the Guru Naak Darbar Sikh  temple
    in Southall.  She was a young woman who belonged to the Sikh faith  and
    ethnicity and who had been subjected to harassment and torture on  that
    account in Afghanistan.  She and her family decided to flee the country
    in order to avoid danger but were separated on  their  way  to  a  safe
    country.  She claimed asylum in the UK, and had been  recognised  as  a
    refugee.  Both Ms P and the appellant were devout  Sikhs  who  attended
    the Sikh temple regularly and took part in sewo as  well  as  community
    and charity work organised by the  temple.   They  became  friends  and
    their personal circumstances brought them together and soon  they  fell
    in love.  The couple were married on 1 May 2012 in a religious ceremony
    at the temple in Hounslow with the blessings of  her  siblings  settled
    here and of friends and acquaintances of the  appellant.   Since  their
    marriage they have lived together as husband and wife in the flat above
    their business premises.

 7. As a recognised refugee in the UK, Ms P had the  right  to  stay  here.
    She had once been uprooted from Afghanistan, and it was unreasonable to
    expect her to uproot for the second  time  to  go  and  live  with  her
    husband in India, a country which she had never visited.  On the  other
    hand, the appellant's family in India had disowned him because they had
    strongly objected to him marrying a Russian on 3  November  2002,  when
    they wanted him to marry a young lady from India.  He had  grown  apart
    from his family and had not had any contact with them:

         "He is sad to learn  they  are  even  not  happy  with  his  second
         marriage as our client is a Sikh female who had been  subjected  to
         sexual  abuse.   Therefore,  the  couple  will  not   receive   any
         emotional, logistical or financial support from them in  India  and
         instead they will look down upon them."

 8. The appellant was over the age of 18 and had continuously lived in  the
    UK for more than eight and a half years, and he had very limited social
    and cultural ties with India.  He had not had  any  family  ties  since
    2001.  He left India some twelve years ago, and had not been  to  India
    for the last four years.  His last  two  journeys  to  India  had  been
    purely for religious purposes to visit the Golden Temple  in  Amritsar,
    Punjab.

The Refusal Decision

 9. On 8 November 2013 the Secretary of State gave her reasons for refusing
    to grant the appellant leave to remain on the basis of his relationship
    with Ms P.  From the information provided, he had only been living with
    Ms P since their Sikh marriage in May 2012.  He provided a  certificate
    of marriage from a Sikh ceremony, but provided no  evidence  that  they
    had registered this at a civil registry office.  So he did  not  fulfil
    the definition of a partner as defined in paragraph GEN.1.2 of Appendix
    FM, and so could not meet the requirements of Section R-LTRP.  She  had
    considered  whether  EX.1  applied  to  his   application.    But   his
    application fell for refusal under the eligibility requirements of  the
    Rules as set out earlier.  These are mandatory requirements that  apply
    to all applicants regardless of whether the EX.1 criteria were met.  As
    he had failed to meet those  eligibility  requirements,  he  could  not
    benefit from the criteria set out at EX.1.

10. It has also been considered whether the  particular  circumstances  set
    out in his application  constituted  exceptional  circumstances  which,
    consistent with the right  to  respect  for  private  and  family  life
    contained in  Article  8  ECHR,  might  warrant  consideration  by  the
    Secretary of State of a grant of leave to remain in the United  Kingdom
    outside the requirements of the Rules.  It had been decided  that  they
    did not.  Although he had provided evidence that  his  claimed  partner
    had refugee status as an Afghan national, this would not  prevent  them
    from continuing their relationship in India.

Subsequent developments

11. By a letter dated  15  November  2013  Samars  Solicitors  invited  the
    respondent to take enforcement action so  as  to  trigger  a  right  of
    appeal for their client.  The appellant was served with an IS15A notice
    on 10 December 2013 in which it was asserted that he had had  no  valid
    leave since 5  May  2009,  and  therefore  had  overstayed  since  then
    contrary to Section 10 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999.  But the
    appellant was not  served  with  an  IS15B  notice,  and  the  position
    initially taken by the respondent was that he had no in  country  right
    of appeal.

12. In the grounds of appeal to the  First-tier  Tribunal  settled  by  the
    appellant's solicitors on  19  December  2013,  they  referred  to  the
    appellant's arrest in the early hours of 10 December 2013.   They  said
    that both the appellant and his  wife  were  at  home  and  the  sudden
    appearance of the officers made his pregnant wife who  was  cooking  at
    the time very frightened and  upset.   She  had  had  to  seek  medical
    attention because of the fear instilled in  her  as  a  result  of  the
    sudden appearance of the officers, and also the decision to remove  the
    appellant.  She was a rape victim and the incident on the 10th  brought
    her difficult memories back in respect of which she  had  had  to  seek
    medical attention.   She  had  been  referred  to  a  consultant.   She
    suffered from diabetes, as well as being six months' pregnant.  So  she
    had to attend hospital for tests every week, and it was very  important
    that she was accompanied by her husband and that he continued  to  stay
    with her to enable them to enjoy their family life together.

The Hearing Before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

13. The appellant's appeal came before Judge Seelhoff sitting  at  Richmond
    Magistrates' Court on 4 October 2014.  The appellant was represented by
    Mr ï¿½ Ceallaigh of Counsel, and Mr Grennan,  a  Home  Office  Presenting
    Officer, appeared on behalf of the respondent.

14. In paragraphs 10 to 13 of his subsequent decision, Judge Seelhoff noted
    the extensive documentary  evidence  that  had  been  collated  by  the
    appellant's solicitors.  This included  a  birth  certificate  for  the
    couple's first child, a son by the name of Parbah, who had been born on
    3 April 2014; and a recent medical report from Laura  O'Hanlon  on  the
    perinatal mental health team at East London NHS dated 19 September 2014
    which talked about Ms P's problems with stress and depression.

15. The judge received oral evidence from, among others the  appellant  and
    his wife,  and  a  summary  of  the  evidence  given  is  contained  in
    paragraphs 14 to 23 of his decision.  The appellant said that having to
    go to India would ruin his life and stop his business because his  wife
    was not capable of running the business while their baby was young.  He
    also suggested that they could not move to India because  he  had  been
    away for fifteen to sixteen years and his parents were still  angry  at
    him for marrying a Russian the first time and an Afghan, rather than an
    Indian, this time.  The appellant claimed that he could not  live  away
    from his family because no one would help him financially, and  because
    it would be a brand new community for his wife.  In  cross-examination,
    the appellant insisted that his wife had had no contact with his family
    beyond a few telephone  conversations.   He  confirmed  that  he  still
    talked to his parents by phone and to his siblings from time to time.

16.  The  appellant's  wife  gave  evidence  with  the  assistance  of   an
    interpreter.  She confirmed that she would be devastated if her husband
    went to India and said it would not be feasible for her to go and  live
    there as she had not been there.  She  insisted  her  husband's  family
    would not accept her  if  they  were  to  move  to  India.   In  cross-
    examination she conceded that she spoke Punjabi but she  said  she  was
    finding it difficult to run the business while raising  a  small  child
    and whilst her husband could not help.

17. The judge heard from the appellant's British sister-in-law  Jagjit  who
    claimed that on a recent  visit  to  India  she  had  bumped  into  the
    appellant's mother by chance at a festival at a gurdwara.  Jagjit  said
    she attempted  to  introduce  herself  to  the  appellant's  mother  to
    congratulate her on the birth of  her  grandson,  but  the  appellant's
    family were very rude to her.

18. In his closing submissions on behalf of the respondent, Mr Grennan said
    it would be manifestly unfair to allow the appeal given the appellant's
    conduct since his arrival.  He had been  working  here  illegally  from
    2009, instead of returning to India.  His wife had married him  knowing
    he was here illegally.  The business skills involved in running a  shop
    and selling garments in the UK should be readily transferable to  India
    given that the appellant's clients' base was predominantly  Asian.   In
    reply, Mr ï¿½ Ceallaigh relied on his skeleton argument and said that the
    appeal should be allowed.  He pointed out that the  appellant  came  to
    the UK lawfully, started working lawfully,  including  setting  up  the
    business lawfully, but was then refused leave  to  remain  at  a  later
    date.  He drew the judge's attention to his wife's history as a refugee
    and as a rape victim, and said this could present problems for her with
    her in-laws, especially as no dowry had been paid and as there  was  an
    issue with her being of a different caste to her husband.

19. The judge's findings are set out at paragraphs 24 onwards.  Whilst  the
    overall narrative of the case was not  contentious,  he  was  concerned
    that the appellant and his family had not taken  all  reasonable  steps
    open to them to provide accurate information about the  business.   The
    appellant told him that the stock of his business had no value then his
    business had no value if it was sold.  He found  this  answer  on  this
    question was simply dishonest and was  an  example  of  an  attempt  to
    suggest that moving to India would be far harder than  it  truly  would
    be.  The appellant claimed that the business made a profit of ï¿½30,000 a
    year for the last financial year and that he was entitled to  claim  70
    per cent of that profit.  That,  the  judge  observed,  would  give  an
    income of ï¿½21,000.  This would be after the wages  that  his  wife  had
    drawn from the business.  Looking at the pay slips for the  appellant's
    wife as of 28 February 2014, she had  claimed  wages  totalling  nearly
    ï¿½5,000 for the financial year.  That would give the couple an income of
    ï¿½26,000 for tax purposes, which  was  in  excess  of  the  ï¿½22,400  the
    appellant would need to show should he apply for entry  clearance  from
    India under Appendix FM.  If the appellant was  making  an  application
    for entry clearance, his income would be calculated as a combination of
    salary and dividend payments received in the last financial year  which
    would on the face of it mean that he would be eligible  for  a  partner
    visa under Appendix FM, provided he sat an A1 English test.

20. In respect of  the  evidence  of  the  sister-in-law,  he  found  it  a
    remarkable coincidence that on a  one-off  visit  to  India  she  could
    happen to bump into the appellant's mother, and  recognise  her  having
    never met her before.  He  also  found  it  hard  to  accept  that  the
    appellant's parents would still be talking to him regularly if they had
    disowned him, or that they were as unwilling to help  as  he  suggested
    they were: "Whilst the evidence may be  limited  I  did  not  find  the
    account of the ongoing  estrangement  between  the  appellant  and  his
    family to be credible."

21. The judge found that if their account of their  income  was  true  then
    actually what they were faced with was a choice between  being  allowed
    to circumvent the Immigration Rules or the appellant returning to India
    for a short period of time to make an application for  entry  clearance
    which would be appropriate because he was in the UK illegally  and  had
    been for some time.   An  application  for  entry  clearance  ought  to
    succeed in fairly short order given  that  the  couple  had  now  lived
    together for two years, as they were  qualified  to  be  recognised  as
    unmarried partners for the purposes of Appendix FM.  He  confirmed  for
    the avoidance of doubt that he accepted the relationship was a  genuine
    one and it would be inappropriate for an  Entry  Clearance  Officer  to
    dispute that finding without significant additional evidence.

22. The judge continued:

         42.  I am conscious of the appellant's wife's traumatic history  in
             Afghanistan and her evidence that she would find it incredibly
             distressing coping without the appellant.   However  it  seems
             clear to me that the appellant's  assets  in  terms  of  stock
             alone in the business is over ï¿½400,000 of which his  share  is
             70 per cent.  If the couple were to relocate to  India  having
             realised just ï¿½200,000 of the value of the stock they would be
             in a position to  set  up  without  support  from  any  family
             members in any part of the country they chose to.  The reality
             of the circumstances this family would be facing in  India  is
             very different  from  what  they  sought  to  portray  at  the
             hearing.  They would not be forced to seek  support  from  his
             family if his family have truly ostracised him and they  would
             not be forced to live close to his family.

         43.  The appellant's wife said  she  would  find  it  difficult  to
             adjust to a new country but she has clearly adjusted to the UK
             fairly quickly already albeit I note that  this  is  with  the
             support of her brothers and her sisters around her.  The  core
             of the case is the fact the appellant's wife  chose  to  marry
             someone she knew was in the country  illegally  and  chose  to
             have a baby at a  time  when  she  knew  her  husband  had  no
             permission to be in the UK.  In these circumstances she cannot
             have had any reasonable expectation that the  appellant  would
             be allowed to remain in the UK and [she]  is  to  [a]  certain
             extent the author of the misfortune she  may  encounter  as  a
             consequence of that decision.

Reasons for Finding an Error of Law

23. Following an error of law hearing on 25  February  2014,  Deputy  Upper
    Tribunal Judge I A Lewis ruled  in  the  appellant's  favour  that  the
    decision of Judge Seelhoff was vitiated by a material error of law such
    that it should be set aside  and  remade  in  the  Upper  Tribunal.   I
    reproduce his error of law decision promulgated on 3 March 2015  below.



         Consideration: Error of Law

         8.   The First-tier Tribunal Judge considered Article  8  from  two
             perspectives.  Firstly, on  the  premise  that  the  Appellant
             could leave the UK to apply for entry clearance as  a  partner
             (decision at paragraphs  29-40  and  44).   Secondly,  in  the
             alternative, the  Judge  considered  the  possibility  of  the
             family relocating to India (paragraphs 42-43 and 44).

         9.   The  Judge's  conclusions  in  this  regard  are  set  out  at
             paragraph 44:

             "In all the circumstances of this  case  I  find  that  it  is
             entirely proportionate for the Appellant  to  be  expected  to
             return to India to make an application to come to the UK under
             Appendix FM as he does on the face of  his  own  evidence  and
             that of his family meet  the  income  level  required  by  the
             Immigration Rules.  If he cannot meet the requirements of  the
             Rules given the considerable value of his business I find that
             he would comfortably be able to fund the family relocating."

         10.  In respect of the Judge's analysis that  the  Appellant  could
             leave the UK for a relatively limited period in order to  make
             an application for entry clearance as a partner, complaint  is
             made to the Upper Tribunal that the Judge erred in a number of
             respects including in particular by  failing  to  have  proper
             regard to the  best  interests  of  the  couple's  child,  and
             failing to apply the principles and guidance in Chikwamaba.

         11.  There is however a more fundamental problem -  not  identified
             in the grounds in support of the application for permission to
             appeal or otherwise raised by  Ms  Mellon  -  but  which  upon
             discussion both  representatives  acknowledged  and  accepted.
             The Judge has  plainly  premised  his  considerations  on  the
             earnings of the Appellant from his business being such that he
             will satisfy the financial requirements of the Rules.  However
             this is entirely to disregard that  the  requirements  of  the
             Rules in respect of income from employment or  self-employment
             are that it  the  income  of  the  UK-based  partner  that  is
             relevant, not the income or potential earning capacity of  the
             applicant.

         12.  It follows that the Judge's analysis and conclusion that there
             would only be a relatively limited interference in family life
             were the Appellant to leave the United  Kingdom  in  order  to
             pursue an application for  entry  clearance  from  abroad,  is
             fundamentally and fatally flawed.

         13.  The focus in the  case,  therefore,  moves  to  the  issue  of
             relocation of the family to India.

         14.  I am just persuaded that the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  has
             erred in this regard too.

         15.  Without at this stage deciding the matters - I do not see  any
             obvious merit in the  submissions  based  on  the  Appellant's
             partner's status as a refugee, or her not being a national  of
             India - in this latter regard it would be  necessary  for  the
             Appellant to show that Indian immigration  law  would  prevent
             the entry of the spouse of an Indian  national.   However,  it
             seems to me that there is substance in the submission  to  the
             following effect:  the  Appellant's  partner's  mental  health
             might be adversely affected by relocation to  an  extent  that
             would impact on  her  ability  to  care  for  her  child,  and
             therefore removal of the  family  would  be  contrary  to  the
             child's best  interests.   This  submission  is  approximately
             articulated in the Skeleton  Argument  First-tier  Tribunal  -
             e.g. see paragraph 24(iii).

         16.  Whilst the First-tier Tribunal Judge  identifies  that  he  is
             "conscious  of  the  Appellants  wife's   traumatic   history"
             (paragraph 42), and also acknowledges that her  adjustment  in
             the UK was with the support of her siblings (paragraph 43), he
             is, in my judgment, unduly dismissive of any  difficulties  in
             adjusting to life  in  India  at  paragraph  43  by  seemingly
             answering the point by reference to her knowledge that she was
             marrying somebody present in the UK without  leave  and  could
             therefore  not  have  any  reasonable  expectation  that   the
             Appellant would be allowed to remain.  This is not  to  engage
             with the issue of adjustment.  Moreover the  Judge's  analysis
             does not involve a consideration of,  or  the  making  of  any
             findings upon, the medical evidence that  has  been  filed  in
             support of  the  appeal.   This  evidence  in  part  expresses
             concerns over "the idea of change and fear of her  life  being
             disrupted"  (Appellant's  bundle  page   153,   psychologist's
             letter, East London NHS, 26 February 2014).

         17.  In such circumstances I  find  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
             Judge materially erred, and that the decision  of  the  First-
             tier Tribunal must be set aside.

         18.  For the avoidance of doubt, save in respect of the very narrow
             basis upon which the child's best interests might be  impacted
             in the process of relocation, I did not find in the context of
             'error of law' there to be any merit in  the  submission  that
             the  Judge  had  not  had  due  regard  to  the  child's  best
             interests.  Ms Mellon sought to  amplify  'Ground  1'  of  the
             grounds in support of the application for permission to appeal
             by reference to JO and others (section 55 duty) Nigeria [2014]
             UKUT 00517 (IAC).  It was submitted that the Judge should have
             made more enquiry in order to  ensure  that  he  was  properly
             informed in respect of the position of the child.  It is to be
             noted from the head note in JO that the question  whether  the
             duties imposed by section 55  of  been  duly  performed  "will
             invariably be an intensely fact sensitive and contextual one",
             and in practical terms may be confined to the details  of  any
             application or  submission  made  by  the  appellant  and  the
             Respondent's stated position  in  any  decision  letter.   The
             birth of the child hearing postdated the Respondent's decision
             and so, necessarily, the actual circumstances of the child did
             not feature in either the application or  the  decision.   The
             supporting evidence in respect of the child before the  First-
             tier Tribunal did not go much beyond evidence of the  fact  of
             his birth some few months prior to the hearing.   It  was  not
             suggested before the First-tier Tribunal Judge, and Ms  Mellon
             confirmed the position to  me,  that  there  was  anything  of
             concern or otherwise unusual in  respect  of  the  child  that
             required particular consideration.  I do not  accept  that  in
             those circumstances the Judge's evaluation that "as an  infant
             his interests do not extend significantly beyond being allowed
             to  remain  with  his  parents"  was  in  any  way  in  error,
             incomplete, or inadequate.

         19.  Nor is there anything of substance, in  my  judgment,  in  the
             criticism of the Judge's finding in respect of the Appellant's
             sister-in-law's evidence as to her  chance  meeting  with  the
             Appellant's family at a festival she attended  in  India:  see
             decision at paragraphs 20 and 31.  It was  not  necessary  for
             the Judge to put to the witness any sense of  incredulity,  or
             unlikeliness, prior to evaluating the evidence as part of  his
             reasoning in determining that  he  did  not  accept  that  the
             Appellant was estranged from his own family.

         20.  In respect of the criticism made in the grounds in support  of
             the application for permission to appeal that the Judge  erred
             in proceeding on the basis that  the  Appellant  had  conceded
             that he could not qualify under the Rules, when  in  fact  his
             Counsel had made  no  such  concession  and  had  advanced  an
             argument in respect of paragraph EX.1 of Appendix FM,  I  note
             the following.  The submission in  the  Skeleton  Argument  is
             based on paragraph EX.1 as a 'freestanding' provision.  It  is
             not  a  freestanding  provision.   No  other  submission   was
             advanced as to how the Appellant might meet any of  the  rules
             under Appendix FM, and his case  under  paragraph  276ADE  was
             expressly conceded (Skeleton at paragraph 7).  In reality  the
             Appellant was not advancing a complete submission  in  respect
             of   the   Rules.    Necessarily   it   follows    that    any
             misunderstanding on the part of the Judge as  to  whether  the
             point was being conceded or not was immaterial: the  Appellant
             had no case under the Rules.

         Future Conduct of the Appeal

         21.  There is no real issue between the parties in respect  of  the
             primary facts, and as such it is not necessary to reconvene  a
             full fact-finding hearing before the First-tier Tribunal.   It
             is appropriate that the  decision  in  the  appeal  be  remade
             before the Upper Tribunal.  After brief  discussion  with  the
             representatives I decided that the appeal should be adjourned,
             to provide the Appellant with a further  opportunity  to  file
             any relevant evidence in respect of the issue of relocation to
             India.

         22.  I gave an oral direction at the hearing - which I repeat  here
             - that any further evidence upon which the Appellant wishes to
             rely should be filed and serve within 28 days of the  date  of
             hearing (i.e. 28 days from 25 February 2015).

         Notice of Decision

         23.  The decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  contained  a
             material error of law and is set aside.

         24.  The decision in the appeal is to be remade  before  the  Upper
             Tribunal confined to the issue of Article 8 in the context  of
             the Appellant, his wife, and child,  relocating  as  a  family
             unit to India.

The Resumed Hearing

24. For the purposes of the remaking of the decision, Mr  ï¿½  Ceallaigh  did
    not call further evidence from the appellant or his wife.  I noted that
    the claim that his wife was from a different caste had not featured  in
    the witness statements of the appellant or his wife  that  were  placed
    before the First-tier Tribunal.  Mr ï¿½  Ceallaigh  explained  that  this
    claim had been advanced in the course of oral evidence before the First-
    tier Tribunal.  He  confirmed  that  his  instructions  were  that  the
    appellant had not been in contact with his family.

25. Mr ï¿½ Ceallaigh drew my attention to a  short  report  from  Dr  Charles
    Musters, consultant psychiatrist, who responded to a request  from  the
    appellant's solicitors made on 9 March 2015.  Dr Charles Musters  is  a
    member of the perinatal mental health team  at  Newham  University  NHS
    Trust.  He had been unable to provide a  comprehensive  report,  as  he
    needed to charge a fee for such report  as  it  fell  outside  his  NHS
    responsibilities.  As Ms P was self-funding, local policy prevented him
    from accepting any form of payment from her.  This meant  that  he  was
    restricted to writing the present brief report summarising her care  in
    the perinatal mental health team since her referral in  December  2013,
    and addressing the two questions which they had raised in their letter.



26. She was first referred to the perinatal team  in  December  2013  by  a
    midwife, who noted a background of significant  childhood  trauma,  and
    considerable  long-going  anxieties  in  relation  to   her   husband's
    threatened deportation from the UK.  She was initially assessed  on  16
    January 2014 and then had  a  series  of  appointments  throughout  the
    remainder of her pregnancy and over in the next year.  She received ten
    sessions of psychological therapy from 13 June to 19 September and  was
    then seen again in the perinatal team on 14 October  2014,  5  November
    2014 and again for a final appointment on 17 February 2015.  Throughout
    this period she suffered from symptoms of depression  and  PTSD,  which
    varied in intensity.  She made good use  of  the  services  which  were
    offered to her, particularly in regards to bonding with her unborn baby
    antenatally, and that she  continued  to  exhibit  marked  symptoms  of
    anxiety and hyper-vigilance at times when someone came and  knocked  on
    the door, and this was always closely linked to the  strong  fear  that
    her husband may be deported.

27. In the opinion  of  the  therapist,  her  previous  traumas  have  been
    reactivated by these ongoing  fears  about  her  husband's  immigration
    status, in a way that was highly disruptive to her life.  She  had  had
    suicidal thoughts in the past and an ongoing concern in  the  perinatal
    team was that these might return if  she  faced  further  adverse  life
    events, or the deportation of her husband.  When she was seen  for  her
    final appointment in February 2015, a decision was taken  to  discharge
    her fully from mental health services.  With her child  nearly  a  year
    old she was no longer eligible for treatment in  the  perinatal  mental
    health team, and her ongoing difficulties were not of a severity  which
    would necessitate a need for the general adult community mental  health
    team.

28. It was his view, and the view of the team as a whole,  that  Ms  P  was
    currently well, and was likely to remain so for  as  long  as  she  was
    living in the UK and her social circumstances  were  stable.   She  had
    demonstrated objectively a tendency to become  significantly  depressed
    and anxious at times when the  threats  of  deportation  or  relocation
    increased.  For this reason he was  extremely  confident  that  if  the
    family was broken up, or if the whole family relocated to India,  there
    would  be  a  significant  deterioration  in  Ms  P's  mental   health,
    accompanied by a risk of suicidal thoughts.   When  she  was  intensely
    distressed and anxious she was distracted and preoccupied  by  her  own
    thoughts and so her capacity to provide appropriate and responsive care
    to her child was reduced.

29. Mr ï¿½ Ceallaigh also drew my attention to the India  2013  Human  Rights
    report, in particular to page 40.  The law prohibits discrimination  on
    the basis of race, gender, disability, language, place of birth,  caste
    or social status.   The  government  worked  with  varying  degrees  of
    success to enforce these provisions.  On the topic of women  and  rape,
    observers considered rape an underreported crime.  Law enforcement  and
    legal avenues for rape victims were  inadequate,  overtaxed,  and  were
    unable to address the problem effectively.  Doctors  sometimes  further
    abuse rape victims who reported the crimes by using  the  two  fingered
    test to speculate on their sexual history.  The Supreme Court ruled  in
    May that this practice violated the rape victim's right to privacy  and
    asked the government to provide better alternatives.

30. On 25 March 2015 Mr Robert Simpson, independent social worker, prepared
    a report on the appellant's family.  Ms P was dependent on her husband,
    financially, practically and emotionally.  As he was not  permitted  to
    work at the moment, this was having an adverse impact on  the  couple's
    income.  The appellant would be seen by his parents as a  man  who  had
    not only married a woman from outside their faith, but a damaged woman.
     The risk to the appellant's wife should this information be discovered
    would  be  significant.   Given  that  she  managed  to   escape   from
    Afghanistan, and had been given refuge in the United  Kingdom,  a  safe
    haven, it would seem incredulous to ask her to  consider  moving  to  a
    country with such a well publicised record of the  appalling  treatment
    of women such as India.  There was growing momentum to  the  view  that
    women in India are protected by no-one.  The appellant's wife would not
    be accepted culturally as his wife, based upon the past conduct of  how
    they became in a union.

31. He observed that, during the interview, the child followed  his  father
    around the room with his eyes, and when closer  physically,  the  child
    moved towards his father.  The child took a  brief  nap,  and  when  he
    woke, the child headed straight for his father.  The  child  was  fully
    reliant on his parents for all his needs, and his mother was  currently
    reliant upon the appellant while she addressed her  own  health  issues
    subsequent to her experiences in Afghanistan.  Hence the removal of the
    child's father would invariably lead to trauma and he did  not  believe
    that removal of the appellant from the child's life  would  be  in  the
    child's best interests.  The attachment of the child to his father  was
    very visibly obvious.  At his current age, there was a real  risk  that
    he would not be able to be cared for by his mother, if his  father  was
    not present.  The appellant's support of his wife enabled her  to  care
    for the child.  He felt that the appellant's  wife  was  not  yet  well
    enough to care for the child alone.  She had a  number  of  mental  and
    emotional health issues which were being treated, but  would  certainly
    require an assessment with the local  authority's  social  services  to
    enable that she was able to parent her child safely without the support
    of her husband.

32. Mr ï¿½ Ceallaigh agreed that the  report  of  Mr  Simpson  was  primarily
    directed at the impact on the  child  of  the  appellant's  removal  to
    India, as opposed to the impact on the child of the  family  relocating
    as a family unit to India.

33. In his closing submissions, Mr ï¿½ Ceallaigh referred me to his extensive
    skeleton argument in which he submitted that there were  insurmountable
    obstacles to the appellant relocating to India with his spouse.   These
    were, as listed in paragraph 34 of the skeleton argument, as follows:

      i) Ms P was a national of Afghanistan;

     ii) she suffered from PTSD and depression which was  likely  to  worsen
         significantly if she had to leave the country, which  might  result
         in a risk of suicide and an increased inability to look  after  her
         child;

    iii) she had refugee status in the United Kingdom and no right at all to
         live in India where she had never been;

     iv) she was heavily reliant on family members in the United Kingdom due
         to her traumatic history and young child;

      v) the family's income came from a business which was  in  the  United
         Kingdom and it could not simply be moved;

     vi) the appellant's wife was of a different caste and was a  victim  of
         rape and the couple would face discrimination (at best)  in  India,
         and would be ostracised by the appellant's family.

Discussion and Findings

34. The necessary starting  point  is  the  recognition  that  the  primary
    findings of fact made by Judge Seelhoff have been  preserved  by  Judge
    Lewis in his error of law ruling.  In particular, Judge Lewis  did  not
    purport to set  aside  the  judge's  finding  that  the  appellant  had
    sufficient resources to  re-establish  himself  in  India  without  any
    financial support from his family there; and that the appellant was  in
    contact with his family in India, who not ostracised him on account  of
    his marriage to an Afghan national.  The one error identified by  Judge
    Lewis in the judge's assessment  of  the  potential  obstacles  to  the
    family's relocation was that the judge had not adequately engaged  with
    the issue of the ability of the appellant's wife to  adjust  to  a  new
    life in India, in the light of the medical evidence.

35. I accept that the brief report from Dr Charles Musters has  independent
    probative value. But on a holistic assessment of the evidence,  I  find
    that the appellant has not established to the lower standard  of  proof
    that relocating to India with his wife and child would expose his  wife
    to a real risk of suicide or self-harm; or, that it  would  lead  to  a
    flagrant violation of her physical  and  moral  integrity  such  as  to
    breach her rights  under  Article  8  ECHR.   As  acknowledged  in  the
    psychiatrist's report, Ms P's condition is simply not serious enough to
    warrant continuing intervention by a mental health team.  The report of
    Mr Simpson only serves to highlight a clear theme  which  runs  through
    the medical evidence which is that the trigger of, and the main  driver
    for, these symptoms of mental ill health has been  the  threat  of  her
    husband's removal to India, and her being left behind to  cope  on  her
    own with the business and their baby.   This  would  be  a  significant
    disruption of her settled life in the UK.  I accept that relocating  to
    India would also represent a significant disruption of  P's  life.  But
    the the asserted obstacles to her adjustment to life in India, and  her
    integration into the Sikh community in Punjab Province (which would  be
    the couple's obvious destination, given their  common  Sikh  heritage),
    are not credible or well-founded.

36. It is simply not credible that the appellant's  family  are  displeased
    with the appellant's choice of  bride,  given  that  she  is  a  fellow
    adherent to the Sikh faith.  There is no objective evidence to  support
    the proposition that because she is an Afghan national, as  opposed  to
    being an Indian national, this would count against her in circumstances
    where she shares the  same  faith  and  hence  the  same  cultural  and
    religious heritage of Sikhs in the Punjab Province of India.

37. I also attach no credence to the claim, introduced for the  first  time
    in oral evidence before the First-tier Tribunal, that  the  appellant's
    family in India reject Ms P because she is of a  different  caste.   If
    there was any truth in this claim, it is reasonable to expect  that  it
    would have been raised in the witness statements before the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  Judge Seelhoff found that the appellant was  dishonest,  and
    was exaggerating the difficulties which they would face  on  relocation
    to India. In line with  his  undisturbed  findings,  I  find  that  the
    alleged ostracism of Ms P on the grounds of caste is a fabrication.

38. Judge  Seelhoff  accepted  that  P  had  had  a  traumatic  history  in
    Afghanistan, and that she had been a victim of rape there.  While it is
    credible that she should have revealed her  traumatic  history  to  her
    husband, it is not credible that she has publicised her history to  the
    world at large.  Similarly, it is not credible that the appellant would
    have informed his family that his new wife had been a victim  of  rape.
    Indian law, no less than English law, acknowledges the right of privacy
    for rape victims, and it is very difficult to see how details of Ms P's
    traumatic history in Afghanistan would become known to the  appellant's
    family in India, still less to wider society, unless and insofar as  Ms
    P herself chose to forgo her right of privacy.  There is no  reason  to
    suppose that she would do so, and there are not substantial grounds for
    believing  that  Ms  P  will  be  exposed  to   societal   stigma   and
    discrimination in India as a result of it being revealed to  the  world
    that she is a former victim of rape.

39. As canvassed in Mr Simpson's report, the appellant is essential to  his
    wife's wellbeing and mental  stability.   Since  there  are  no  legal,
    linguistic, cultural or financial barriers to the  family's  relocation
    to India, there are not substantial  grounds  for  believing  that  P's
    fragile mental state will lead to a very serious hardship in  adjusting
    to life in India when she will have the continued presence and  support
    of her husband.  In conclusion, the appellant does not come within  the
    scope of the exemption criteria contained in EX.1.

40. Turning to an Article 8 assessment outside the  Rules,  I  accept  that
    questions 1 and 2  of  the  Razgar  test  should  be  answered  in  the
    appellant's favour with regard to establishment of private  life  here.
    But the refusal decision does not engender  serious  interference  with
    family  life,  as  there  are  not  insurmountable  obstacles  to   the
    appellant's wife and child accompanying him to India.

41. Questions 3 and 4 of the Razgar test should be answered  in  favour  of
    the respondent, and so the crucial question  is  whether  the  decision
    appealed against is a proportionate one.  As the appellant cannot bring
    himself within  EX.1,  he  has  to  identify  compelling  circumstances
    outside the Rules which justify the grant of Article 8 relief.

42. The best interests of an affected child are a primary consideration  in
    the proportionality assessment.  Given the child's age and nationality,
    his best interests plainly lie with him remaining with his  mother  and
    father, wherever they  happen  to  be.   The  only  factor  potentially
    militating against the child going with his mother  to  India  was  the
    alleged adverse impact on her mental health, and thus her consequential
    ability to care for him.  For the reasons given above, I find there  is
    no substance in this proposition.  Even when her mental health symptoms
    were more acute, she was apparently able to provide adequate  care  for
    her child, with the support of her husband.  Now that her condition has
    stabilised, there are not substantial grounds for  believing  that  the
    quality of care that she would give to her child would in  any  way  be
    compromised on relocation to India.

43. I have taken into account the public  interest  considerations  arising
    under Section 117B of the 2002 Act, and I acknowledge that it is in the
    appellant's favour that he speaks good English.   It  is  also  in  the
    appellant's favour that he is financially independent, although it must
    also be recognised that his financial independence stems in  part  from
    him working illegally after 5 May 2009.  Although his  wife  is  now  a
    qualifying partner, little weight can be attached to family life  which
    is established whilst the applicant is here unlawfully.   As  found  by
    Judge Seelhoff, the relationship began after the  appellant  became  an
    overstayer, and Ms P knew when she married  the  appellant  at  a  Sikh
    ceremony in May 2012 that he was present in the UK unlawfully,  and  so
    her ability to carry on family life with him in the UK, as  opposed  to
    elsewhere, was highly precarious.

44. In conclusion, I  find  that  there  are  not  sufficiently  compelling
    circumstances such as to justify the appellant being granted Article  8
    relief outside the Rules.  I find that the  decision  appealed  against
    strikes a fair balance  between,  on  the  one  hand,  the  rights  and
    interests of the appellant, his wife and  child,  and  extended  family
    members here, and, on the other hand, the wider interests  of  society.
    It is proportionate to the legitimate public end sought to be achieved,
    namely the maintenance of firm and effective immigration controls.

Conclusion

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  contained  an  error  of  law,  and
accordingly the  decision  is  set  aside  and  the  following  decision  is
substituted:

This appeal is dismissed under the Rules and under Article 8 ECHR.

No anonymity direction is made.
