                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Halstead of Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr Avery, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant is a citizen of Jamaica born on  21  December  1973.   He
    appealed against the respondent's  decision  dated  12  March  2013  to
    remove him from the United Kingdom.  The appellant came to  the  United
    Kingdom on 15 September 2001 as a  visitor  and  overstayed.   He  made
    application for leave to remain  but  not  until  December  2012.   The
    application was made on the  basis  of  the  appellant's  marriage  and
    family here.  That application  was  refused  under  Appendix  FM  with
    reference to EX.1 and paragraph 276ADE.  The appellant's appeal against
    the respondent's refusal was allowed by Judge Norton-Taylor (the judge)
    in a determination promulgated on 20 January 2014.   The  Secretary  of
    State claimed the judge erred in law by applying EX.1 as a stand  alone
    provision.  The consideration of the appellant's Article 8 rights  fell
    within  Appendix  FM,  but  EX.1  of  that  appendix  supplemented  the
    provisions of the Rules.  The respondent claimed that EX.1 did not form
    an independent basis for an appeal to succeed, it merely provided  that
    where EX.1 was met,  other  criteria  (for  example  the  financial  or
    maintenance requirements) could be disregarded.  After a hearing on  29
    April 2014, I found that the judge erred in allowing the  appeal  under
    paragraph EX.1 of Appendix FM as the guidance in Sabir (Appendix  FM  -
    EX.1 not freestanding) [2014] UKUT 63 (IAC) held  that  paragraph  EX.1
    was not freestanding.

 2. Thus the matter came before me to be re-made.  Mr Avery confirmed  that
    there were no issues arising from the facts found by the judge although
    he argued that the strength of the appellant's  relationship  with  his
    son aged 12 (T) had been misrepresented, which I  will  consider.   The
    evidence  is  contained  in  the  appellant's  bundle   including   his
    statements, statement of his  wife,  statement  of  Tracie-Ann  Cowell,
    statement of T and letters of support from  Harold  Anderson,  Reverend
    Lewinson, Jerry McGrath and Mrs Headman's Nottingham relatives,  Marcia
    Pryce, Kumari Golding and Mrs M  Blair.   In  addition,  I  heard  oral
    evidence from the  appellant,  Mrs  Headman  and  Ms  Cowell.   I  will
    summarise the evidence as necessary in the  course  of  explaining  the
    reasons for my decision.  I have considered each item of  evidence  and
    have reviewed that evidence in the round.  The fact  that  I  have  not
    specifically referred  to  any  particular  piece  of  evidence  in  my
    determination does not mean that the evidence has not  been  considered
    in the manner I have described.

 3. Mr Avery made submissions on behalf of the respondent and  Mr  Halstead
    on behalf of the appellant.  I have made a note of their submissions in
    my Record of Proceedings and have taken them into consideration.

Findings and Conclusions

 4. In this appeal the burden lies with the appellant to  prove  the  facts
    and matters he relies upon.  His case was advanced on  the  basis  that
    because his particular circumstances are not covered by the Rules, then
    those circumstances are compelling and/or  extraordinary  such  that  I
    should go on to consider Article 8 in terms of the  proportionality  of
    the respondent's decision.  The standard of proof is that of a  balance
    of probabilities.  (See the determination in  EH  (Iraq)  [2005]  UKIAT
    00065.)

 5. To make a decision regarding the appellant's particular  circumstances,
    it is instructive to set out the development of Article 8 case  law  in
    MF in the Upper Tribunal and the Court of Appeal.  MF (Article 8 -  new
    Rules) Nigeria [2012] UKUT 00393 (IAC) found that the  new  Immigration
    Rules were not a "complete code" when it came to Article  8  claims  as
    decisions still had to be compliant with Section 6 of the Human  Rights
    Act 1998 [25].  The  assessment  remained  in  two  stages,  first  the
    application of the Rules and second, the application of Article 8 [32]-
    [41].  In one important respect, the  new  Rules  affected  the  second
    stage Article 8 assessment because they  gave  greater  specificity  to
    which  circumstances  attracted  the  greatest  weight  in  the  public
    interest.  The degree to which the new Rules changed the interpretation
    of the public interest should not be exaggerated.   Previous  case  law
    held that the proportionality  assessment  did  not  treat  the  public
    interest as immutable such that the Upper Tribunal found that  in  most
    cases, the new Rules established an "exceptionality threshold" for  the
    public interest to be outweighed [42]-[45].

 6. MF (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ 1192 held it was not in dispute  that  the
    case law provided that an appeal  in  a  removal  or  deportation  case
    involved two stages.  First, to assess whether  the  decision  appealed
    against was in accordance with the Immigration  Rules  and  second,  to
    determine whether the decision was contrary to the appellant's  Article
    8 rights [7].  The Court of Appeal found  that  the  picture  that  had
    emerged  from  the  Secretary  of  State  as  to  what  was  meant   by
    "exceptional circumstances"  under  paragraph  398  was  "by  no  means
    entirely clear" [15].  In Izuazu (Article 8 - new  Rules)  [2013]  UKUT
    00045 the Secretary of State argued that the  new  Rules  restored  the
    "exceptional circumstances" test that was disapproved by the  House  of
    Lords in Huang but the Court of Appeal  found  that  was  a  surprising
    submission bearing in mind that the House of  Lords  had  rejected  the
    exceptionality test [31] - [32].

 7. The Rules are a detailed expression of government policy on controlling
    immigration and protecting  the  public  and  the  Article  8  sections
    reflect the Secretary of State's view as  to  where  the  balance  lies
    between the individual's rights and the  public  interest.   The  judge
    must consider proportionality in the light of that expression of public
    policy.  Various cases have confirmed this approach Gulshan (Article  8
    - new Rules - correct approach) [2013] UKUT 00640 (IAC),  Shahzad  (Art
    8: legitimate aim) [2014] UKUT 00085 (IAC) in particular headnote (vi):

         "(vi)    Where an area of the rules does not have such  an  express
             mechanism, the approach in R (Nagre) v Secretary of State  for
             the Home Department [2013]  EWHC  720  (Admin)  ([29]-[31]  in
             particular) and Gulshan (Article  8  -  new  Rules  -  correct
             approach) [2013] UKUT 640 (IAC) should be followed: i.e. after
             applying the requirements of the Rules, only if there  may  be
             arguably good grounds for granting  leave  to  remain  outside
             them is it necessary for  Article  8  purposes  to  go  on  to
             consider  whether  there  are  compelling  circumstances   not
             sufficiently recognised under them."

 8. Iftikhar Ahmed v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2014] EWHC
    300 (Admin) held it is settled law that considerations under Article  8
    are embedded in the Immigration Rules such that  if  the  Secretary  of
    State applied those Rules then, ordinarily,  Article  8  considerations
    would have been fully catered for.  In  that  case,  no  good  arguable
    grounds had been advanced that there had been factors particular to the
    claimant that had not been capable of being assessed  from  within  the
    existing framework of Rules and which therefore needed to  be  assessed
    outside of the Rules.  Further the Secretary of State  had  taken  into
    account all of the factors and matters which had been relevant  to  the
    claimant.  Finally, there had been no error  of  law  in  the  approach
    adopted by the Secretary of State to the question of whether there  had
    been insurmountable obstacles to relocation.

 9. What Mr Halstead says is that  the  appellant's  circumstances  can  be
    distinguished from those in Iftikhar Ahmed.  That is because the  Rules
    fail to envisage a situation  where  the  appellant  is  in  a  marital
    relationship with a British  citizen  and  separately,  has  a  genuine
    caring role in the upbringing of his child, albeit that both the  child
    and his mother, the appellant's  ex-partner,  are  Jamaican  nationals,
    with leave to remain here only until 2015.

10. The view of the respondent was that the appellant was not in a  genuine
    and subsisting parental relationship with T.  Further,  there  were  no
    insurmountable obstacles to family life  with  Mrs  Headman  continuing
    outside of the United Kingdom  and  particularly  so  because  she  was
    originally from Jamaica and she  had  holidayed  there  in  2009.   The
    appellant had come to the United Kingdom in 2001 as a visitor and  only
    made application to remain in 2012.  It was not accepted  that  he  had
    lost ties to his own country.

11. Mr Avery did not  take  issue  with  the  appellant's  genuine  marital
    relationship and parental relationship with T which was disputed in the
    reasons for refusal.  In such circumstances, I find that is a situation
    not recognised under the Rules.  See Nagre at [28] - [29]:
         "As appears from the new guidance issued by the Secretary of  State
         in relation to exercise of her residual discretion to  grant  leave
         to remain outside the Rules, as set out above, and as  Mr  Peckover
         makes clear in his witness statement,  the  new  rules  contemplate
         that there will be some cases in which a right to remain  based  on
         Article 8 can be established, even though falling outside  the  new
         rules.  Therefore, the basic framework of analysis contemplated  by
         Lord Bingham in Huang continues to apply, as was recognised by  the
         Upper Tribunal in Izuazu.
         Nonetheless, the new rules do provide better explicit  coverage  of
         the factors identified in  case-law  as  relevant  to  analysis  of
         claims under Article 8 than was formerly the position, so  in  many
         cases the main points for consideration in relation  to  Article  8
         will be addressed by decision-makers applying the new rules.  It is
         only if, after doing that, there  remains  an  arguable  case  that
         there may be good grounds for granting leave to remain outside  the
         Rules by reference to Article 8  that  it  will  be  necessary  for
         Article  8  purposes  to  go  on  to  consider  whether  there  are
         compelling circumstances not sufficiently recognised under the  new
         rules to require the grant of such leave."

12. I find as regards this particular appellant's circumstances that  there
    are arguably compelling circumstances not sufficiently recognised under
    the Rules as envisaged in Nagre.  I proceed to consider what  Mr  Avery
    referred to as the stand alone stage of Article 8 considerations.

13. Article 8 of ECHR states:

    (i)  Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life,
         his home and his correspondence.

    (ii) There should be no interference by a  public  authority  with  the
         exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law
         and is necessary  in  a  democratic  society  in  the  interest  of
         national security, public safety or the economic wellbeing  of  the
         country,  for  the  prevention  of  disorder  or  crime,  for   the
         protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights
         and freedoms of others.

14. In Razgar [2004] UKHL 27 Lord Bingham gave guidance at paragraph 17  as
    to the correct approach when dealing with Article 8 as follows:

         "In considering whether a challenge to  the  Secretary  of  State's
         decision to remove a person must clearly fail, the reviewing  court
         must consider:

         (i)  Will the proposed removal  be  an  interference  by  a  public
             authority with  the  exercise  of  the  applicant's  right  to
             respect for his private or family life?

         (ii) If so,  will  such  interference  have  consequences  of  such
             gravity as potentially to engage the operation of Article 8?

         (iii)    If so, is such interference in accordance with the law?

         (iv) If so, is such interference necessary in a democratic  society
             in the interest of national security,  public  safety  or  the
             economic wellbeing of  the  country,  for  the  prevention  of
             disorder or crime, or the protection of health or  morals,  or
             for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others?

         (v)  If so, is such interference proportionate  to  the  legitimate
             public end sought to be achieved?"

15. LD (Article 8 - best interests of child) Zimbabwe [2010] UKUT 278 (IAC)
    provided that the best interests of  children  have  to  be  a  primary
    consideration, meaning that they have to be considered first.   Broadly
    speaking, the best interests of the child mean  the  wellbeing  of  the
    child.  ZH (Tanzania) [2011] UKSC  4  provided  that  the  over-arching
    issue is the weight to be given to the best interests of  children  who
    are affected by the decision to remove or deport one or both  of  their
    parents and in what circumstances it is permissible to do so where  the
    effect will be that a child who is a British citizen will also have  to
    leave.  See also Omotunde (Best Interests - Zambrano applied -  Razgar)
    Nigeria [2011] UKUT 00247 (IAC).  There is  no  substantial  difference
    between a human rights  based  assessment  of  proportionality  of  any
    interference considered in ZH and the approach  required  by  community
    law in Zambrano [2011] EUECJ Case C-34/09  OJ  2011  C130-2.   In  this
    particular context the Article 8 assessment questions set out in Razgar
    should be tailored as follows,  placing  the  assessment  of  necessity
    where it most appropriately belongs in the final question dependent  on
    the outcome of proportionality and a fair balance, rather than as  part
    of the identification of the legitimate aim:

      a) Is there family life enjoyed between  the  appellant  and  a  minor
         child that requires respect in the context of immigration  decision
         making?

      b) Would deportation of the parent interfere  with  the  enjoyment  of
         that family life?

      c) Is such an interference in accordance with the law?

      d) Is such an interference in pursuit of a legitimate aim?

      e) Is deportation necessary, proportionate and a fair balance  between
         the rights to respect for the family life of the appellant and  the
         child and the particular public interest in question?

16. E-A (Article 8 - Best Interests of Child)  Nigeria  [2011]  UKUT  00315
    (IAC) Mr Justice Blake and SIJ Jarvis said:

         "(i) The correct starting point in considering the welfare and best
             interests of a young child would be that it  is  in  the  best
             interests of a child to live with and be brought up by his  or
             her parents, subject to  any  very  strong  contra-indication.
             Where it is in the best interests of a child to live with  and
             be brought up by his or her parents, then the child's  removal
             with his parents does not involve  any  separation  of  family
             life.

         (ii) Absent other factors, the reason why a period  of  substantial
             residence as a child may become a weighty consideration in the
             balance of competing considerations is that in the  course  of
             such  time  roots  are  put  down,  personal  identities   are
             developed, friendships are formed and links are made with  the
             community outside the family unit.  The degree to which  these
             elements of private life are forged and therefore  the  weight
             to be given to the passage of time will depend upon the  facts
             in each case.

         (iii)    During a child's very early  years,  he  or  she  will  be
             primarily focused on self and the caring parents or guardians.
              Long residence once the child is likely to have  formed  ties
             outside the family is likely to have greater impact on his  or
             her well being.

         (iv) Those who have their families with them  during  a  period  of
             study in the UK must do so in the light of the expectation  of
             return.

         (v)  The Supreme Court in ZH (Tanzania) was  not  ruling  that  the
             ability of a young child to readily adapt to  life  in  a  new
             country was an irrelevant factor, rather that the adaptability
             of the child in each case  must  be  assessed  and  is  not  a
             conclusive consideration on its own."

17. See the  headnote  in  Azimi-Moayed  and  Others  (Decisions  Affecting
    Children; Onward Appeals) [2013] UKUT 00197 (IAC):




         "Decisions affecting children

         (1)  The  case  law  of  the  Upper  Tribunal  has  identified  the
             following principles to assist in the determination of appeals
             where children are affected by the appealed decisions:

             i)   As a starting point  it  is  in  the  best  interests  of
                  children to be with both their parents and if both parents
                  are  being  removed  from  the  United  Kingdom  then  the
                  starting point suggests that so should dependent  children
                  who form part of their household unless there are  reasons
                  to the contrary.

             ii)  It is generally in the interests of children to have both
                  stability  and  continuity  of  social   and   educational
                  provision and the benefit of growing up  in  the  cultural
                  norms of the society to which they belong.

             iii) Lengthy residence in a country other than  the  state  of
                  origin can lead to development  of  social,  cultural  and
                  educational  ties  that  it  would  be  inappropriate   to
                  disrupt, in  the  absence  of  compelling  reason  to  the
                  contrary.  What amounts to lengthy residence is not  clear
                  cut but past and present policies  have  identified  seven
                  years as a relevant period.

             iv)  Apart from the terms of published policies and rules, the
                  Tribunal notes that seven years from age four is likely to
                  be more significant to a child that the first seven  years
                  of life.   Very  young  children  are  focussed  on  their
                  parents rather than their peers and are adaptable.

             v)   Short periods of  residence,  particularly  ones  without
                  leave or the reasonable expectation of leave to  enter  or
                  remain, while claims are promptly considered, are unlikely
                  to give rise to private life deserving of respect  in  the
                  absence of exceptional factors.  In any event,  protection
                  of the economic  well-being  of  society  amply  justifies
                  removal in such cases."

18. In VW [2009] EWCA Civ 5 the Court of  Appeal  held  that  in  assessing
    proportionality and whether an appellant's family should return to  his
    country of  origin  with  him,  the  test  is  not  whether  there  are
    insurmountable obstacles to prevent  their  going  but  whether  it  is
    reasonable  to  expect  them  to  go.   If  there  are   insurmountable
    obstacles, they will succeed but  if  there  are  not,  they  will  not
    necessarily fail.

19. I found all witnesses straightforward and credible.  I have  no  reason
    to doubt their integrity or the truth of what they told  me.   Although
    Mr Avery sought to establish that the appellant's relationship  with  T
    had been exaggerated for my benefit, I do not find that to be the case.
     There was in my view,  nothing  that  emerged  from  the  evidence  to
    support that proposition.

20. As I have said above, the facts were not  in  dispute.   The  appellant
    came here in 2001 with entry clearance as a visitor and then overstayed
    for eleven years before making application for  leave  to  remain.  The
    appellant has a poor immigration history although there was no evidence
    of any criminal offending. The application was made on the basis of the
    appellant's marriage to Lorraine Headman, a British citizen born  on  1
    April 1964.  The marriage took place in August 2010. Mrs Headman  works
    as a healthcare assistant with children and young  people  with  eating
    disorders, having  previously  worked  with  the  elderly.   She  earns
    �19,000 to �20,000 a year or thereabouts.  Mrs Headman has  her  mother
    and stepfather, an adult daughter and two grandchildren all  living  in
    the Nottingham area.  She came here in 1987.  She has no  property  nor
    close relatives in Jamaica.

21. T was born in the United Kingdom on 20 May 2002.  T  is  now  12.   His
    mother is Ms Cowell,  the  appellant's  former  partner  with  whom  he
    cohabited for eight years or thereabouts until the couple separated  in
    2008.

22. I accept that the appellant has  always  been  involved  in  T's  care,
    upbringing and development and from 2008, when  the  couple  separated,
    the appellant has had regular contact  with  T.   Mrs  Headman  and  Ms
    Cowell told me that they have been able  to  put  their  understandable
    differences on one side in the best interests  of  T  and  the  ongoing
    relationship with the  appellant.  T  stays  with  the  Headmans  every
    alternative weekend from a Saturday lunchtime until a  Sunday  evening,
    taking part in family activities and spending time with his Dad.  He is
    doing well at school and is interested in sporting activities which the
    appellant supports.  Recently, T has been spending additional  separate
    days with his Dad over and above the weekend contact.  Ms  Cowell  sees
    the appellant's involvement in T's life as positive.  She described him
    to me as a responsible, caring father.  As T's mother,  she  recognises
    the appellant's important input to T's life.  Most important, Ms Cowell
    acknowledges how valued the appellant is by T.  I  find  the  appellant
    has always had a genuine sustained relationship with T.  It may be that
    there was a hiccup in contact when the appellant got together with  Mrs
    Headman, however, I found both women adopted  a  mature  approach  with
    regard to their family circumstances and what they both  considered  to
    be T's essential nurturing from his father.

23. I find it is in T's best  interests  that  his  relationship  with  the
    appellant should be allowed to continue and develop.  I find given  the
    loving relationship that exists between them and has  existed  since  T
    was born, the impact upon T of his  father  being  removed  to  Jamaica
    cannot be underestimated. I find the separation would be likely to have
    a devastating effect  upon  his  best  interests,  in  particular,  his
    emotional well being, education and social  development.  He  would  be
    without the important male role model the  appellant  has  consistently
    provided.  In reaching that conclusion I accept that Ms  Cowell  has  a
    partner  and  the  appellant   himself   frankly   acknowledged   that,
    inevitably, a man who forms a life with  a  woman  with  a  child  will
    inevitably influence that child's life. Having said that, the appellant
    is T's primary male focus and particularly because Ms Cowell's  partner
    does not live with her.

24. I bear in mind that T also has contact with Mrs Headman's relatives  in
    Nottingham.   He  last  visited  in  August  or  September  2013.   The
    appellant thought they saw each other two to three times a year.  T  is
    the same age as one of Mrs Headman's grandchildren and they get on well
    when they meet.  It  was  not  suggested  that  in  the  event  of  the
    appellant's removal, T would no longer have  contact  either  with  Mrs
    Headman or the Nottingham relatives but I find that to be  likely;  the
    appellant is the link in these relationships.

25. Mr Headman has three brothers in the United Kingdom with whom he is  in
    regular contact.  The three brothers are known to T and  he  sees  them
    when he is with his Dad. I find the contact to be important in T's best
    interests in terms of his sense of identify and family.

26. I take into account that none of the witnesses have close relatives  in
    Jamaica, nor property there to which they could return;  Mr  Avery  did
    not challenge their evidence in  that  regard.  If  the  appellant  was
    returned there he would be  initially  at  least,  without  a  home  or
    employment. The  appellant's  relationship  with  Ms  Cowell  began  in
    Jamaica before they both  came  to  the  United  Kingdom.   Whilst  Mrs
    Headman visited with other members of her family for a holiday in 2009,
    she has no close family members there.   There  was  no  suggestion  of
    either Mrs Headman or Ms Cowell and T returning  to  Jamaica,  although
    what will happen in 2015 when their leave comes to an end is yet to  be
    decided; there was no evidence before me in that regard. T has known no
    other life other than the United Kingdom; he was  born  here.   In  the
    event that the appellant was removed to Jamaica, there  would  be  long
    distance contact and the prospect of only infrequent visits.

27. This is a stable family, notwithstanding that it  has  been  built  and
    developed upon the appellant's unlawful presence  here.  Leaving  aside
    the  respondent's  duty  to  maintain  immigration  control   and   the
    appellant's unlawful presence, there was no suggestion by Mr Avery that
    there are any public policy issues requiring his removal.   Of  course,
    the appellant has lived the majority of his life in his own country but
    in my view, the status quo should be protected, in  particular  because
    of the appellant's relationship with T.  That is not  to  minimise  the
    impact upon Mrs Headman in terms of Beoku-Betts  [2008]  UKHL  39.  The
    couple were  very  frank  that  Mrs  Headman  had  been  aware  of  the
    appellant's lack of status here from the outset of their  relationship.
    The  appellant's  return  to   Jamaica   would   sever   the   domestic
    circumstances that have developed since the couple met and married. Mrs
    Headman did not suggest that she would feel able to return  to  Jamaica
    with the appellant. Her parents, child and grandchildren all live here.
    She has employment here.

28. Taking into account all that I have set out above and considering those
    circumstances in light of VW [2009] EWCA  Civ  5,  I  do  not  find  it
    reasonable to expect the appellant to be returned to Jamaica.

Conclusion

29. I accept that removing the appellant would interfere with his right  to
    respect to family and private life of such gravity  as  to  potentially
    engage Article 8.  Of course, such interference would be in  accordance
    with the law in the interests of maintaining immigration control.   The
    issue for me must be the proportionality of the respondent's  decision,
    particularly insofar as the refusal bears upon the circumstances of  T.
    For all of the reasons I have set out, I  find  that,  looking  at  the
    situation in the round, the respondent's decision is  disproportionate.
    I make that finding bearing in mind the fact  that  the  appellant  has
    remained here unlawfully.  Nevertheless, I make my  finding  respecting
    the balance between the public interest and family and  private  rights
    and concluding that the appellant's circumstances  are  such  on  these
    particular facts to demand an outcome in his favour.

30. I re-make the decision by allowing the appeal.

Decision

31. Appeal allowed on human rights grounds - Article 8.
