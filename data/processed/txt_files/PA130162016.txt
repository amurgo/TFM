                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent

For the Appellant:     Ms L McCrorie, of Loughran & Co, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals to the UT against a decision by FtT Judge A  M  S
    Green, promulgated on 4 August 2017, on  5  grounds,  set  out  in  the
    application for permission to appeal dated 16 August 2017.

 2.  The  first  and  principal  ground,  which  triggered  the  grant   of
    permission, maintains that the judge erred by  departing  from  country
    guidance, as restated in AA (Iraq) [2017] EWCA Civ 944, in finding  the
    appellant's home area no longer to be a  contested  area,  based  on  a
    Country of Origin Information Report (COIR) by the respondent,  because
    that evidence was (a) insufficient and (b) pre-dated the  reaffirmation
    by the Court of Appeal.

 3. That ground is not well taken in either respect.

 4. The evidence in the COIR was clear and sufficient.  Notably, it has not
    been suggested in the grounds or since that other  background  evidence
    shows the report and the judge to be wrong.

 5. The Court of Appeal  was  concerned  with  legal  issues,  not  factual
    updating.

 6. The respondent's position on ground 1 is supported by Amin [2017]  EWHC
    2417 (ï¿½63, in particular).  Although that case was  a  judicial  review
    and concerned with a different area of Iraq, its principle applies.

 7. Grounds 2 and 3, as Ms McCrorie recognised, depend on ground  1.   They
    fall with it.

 8. Grounds 4 and 5 raise credibility issues,  complaining  of  failure  to
    consider the appellant's account in the round, and lack of reasoning.

 9. These grounds are  no  more  than  insistence,  and  disagreement  with
    factual findings, rather vaguely put.   They specify no proposition  of
    error on any point which might amount to error of law, or  which  might
    justify setting aside the decision as a whole.

10. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.

11. The FtT made an anonymity direction, although no reason is given.   The
    matter was not addressed in the  UT.   Anonymity  has  been  maintained
    herein.
