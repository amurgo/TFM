                                   Between

                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                   Appellant

                          MR JOVAN ANTHONY BURROWES
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr N Bramble, HOPO
For the Respondent:    Mr T Bobb, Solicitor


                          DECISION ON ERROR OF LAW

1.   The Secretary of State's  decision  states  that  on  25  July  2013  a
    decision was made to refuse to revoke a deportation order by virtue  of
    section 5(2) of the Immigration Act 1971.  However, after agreement  to
    withdraw this decision and the deportation order signed on 28  February
    2011, the applicant's solicitor's letter has been  treated  as  further
    representations granting another right of appeal.  The SoS' letter of 5
    March 2014 to the applicant's solicitors confirmed  the  Home  Office's
    agreement to withdraw the deportation order signed on 28 February  2011
    and the subsequent decision of 25  July  2013  and  to  reconsider  his
    solicitor's representations dated 5 July 2013 under  paragraph  353  of
    the Immigration Rules.

2.   On 5 March 2014, the SoS issues a letter giving reasons why it  is  not
    accepted that the applicant's right to family life outweighs the public
    interest in seeking to deport him and concluding that  his  deportation
    would not breach Article 8  of  the  ECHR.   A  Notice  of  Immigration
    Decision to make a deportation order by virtue of  section  3(5)(a)  of
    the Immigration Act was accordingly issued on 5 March 2014.

3.   The applicant's appeal against this  decision  came  before  First-tier
    Judge B Lloyd on 22 September 2014.  Contrary to what the judge said at
    para 3, the SoS had withdrawn  her  decision  refusing  to  revoke  the
    deportation order.  Therefore the only decision before  the  judge  was
    the SoS' decision made on 5 March 2014.

4.   On 28 July 2014, section 19  of  the  2014  Act  introducing  into  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 a new Part  5A  containing
    new  sections  117A-D  came  into  force.   Under  para  A362  of   the
    Immigration Rules of 10 July 2014 (HC 532), where Article 8  is  raised
    in the context of deportation under Part 13 of  these  Rules,  a  claim
    under Article 8 will only succeed where the requirements of  the  rules
    as at 28 July 2014 are met, regardless of when the notice of  intention
    to deport or the deportation order, as appropriate, was served.

5.   There is no evidence in the determination that the  judge  applied  the
    requirements of the 2014 Act to this appeal.  Under section 19  of  the
    2014 Act a judge  is  required  to  consider  the  public  interest  in
    deportation.  Whilst the judge at  para  65  says  that  he  has  given
    careful consideration to the public  interest  of  deportation  of  the
    applicant, there is no evidence of such consideration undertaken by the
    judge in the preceding paragraphs.  This failure amounts to a  material
    error or law.

6.   The judge's decision cannot stand.  The decision has to be remade.

7.   The applicant's appeal is remitted to Newport (Columbus) for  rehearing
    by a judge other than FtTJ B Lloyd.
