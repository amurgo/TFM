                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

For the appellant:     Mr M Chowdhury, instructed by UK Legal & Immigration
Experts
For the respondent:    Mr C Avery, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Rhaciel Rivac  Garcia,  date  of  birth  18.1.87,  is  a
    citizen of the Philippines.

 2. This is her appeal against the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Wellesley-Cole promulgated 3.9.14, dismissing her appeal  against
    the  decision  of  the  respondent,  dated  3.10.13,  to   refuse   her
    application for leave to remain  in  the  UK  outside  the  Immigration
    Rules. The Judge heard the appeal on 24.7.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge Nicholson granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    21.10.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 27.11.14 as an appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination  of  Judge  Wellesley-Cole  should  be  set
    aside.

 6. The relevant background can be briefly summarised as follows. On 8.8.11
    the appellant was granted leave to remain in the UK until 24.8.13 as  a
    Tier 4 General student. Two days before  the  expiry  of  that  student
    leave, she sought variation of leave to remain outside  the  Rules.  It
    was never contended that she could meet any of  the  Immigration  Rules
    for leave to remain. As made, her application for leave to  remain  was
    based on the fact she wanted to  be  registered  as  a  nurse.  It  was
    refused because the reason did not disclose any  genuine  compassionate
    reasons for the Secretary of State to exercise her discretion to  grant
    leave  to  remain.  She  could  return  to  the  Philippines  and  make
    application for entry clearance  under  Tier  2  of  the  Points  Based
    System.

 7. By the time the matter came on appeal before  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    the basis of the appellant's case had  dramatically  changed.  She  now
    asked to be allowed to stay on the  basis  of  a  relationship  with  a
    British man, whom she hoped to marry (which did not  take  place  until
    10.11.14) and that she was 29 weeks pregnant carrying their  child.  As
    they had cohabited only a short period of time, she could not meet  the
    requirements of Appendix FM, or  indeed  any  other  provision  of  the
    Immigration Rules. Their child was born 24.9.14.

 8. The  grounds  of  application  for  permission  to  appeal  are  rather
    difficult to follow, but in the main they contend that the judge  erred
    in:

      a) following Gulshan [2013] UKUT 640 and seeking only  compelling  and
         compassionate circumstances instead  of  making  a  proportionality
         assessment;

      b) failing to determine whether it was reasonable to expect Mr  Minter
         to relocate to the Philippines;

      c) failing to consider the effect of the decision on Mr Minter.

 9. In granting permission to appeal, Judge  Nicholson  observed  that  the
    judge did not specifically consider whether it would be  reasonable  to
    expect Mr Minter to relocate, or the effect on him of the  decision  to
    remove his partner and unborn  child.  "It  is  arguable  that,  having
    embarked on a proportionality assessment  outside  of  the  immigration
    rules, the judge should have considered these issues in line with Huang
    and Kashmiri v SSHD [2007] UKHL 11 and Beoku-Betts (FC) v  SSHD  [2008]
    UKHL 38. Permission is therefore granted on these  grounds.  I  do  not
    refuse permission on the remaining grounds although some lack merit."

10. The Rule 24 Response, dated 14.11.14, submits that the  judge  directed
    herself appropriately. "The judge finds that the  appellant  would  not
    face insurmountable obstacles to continuing her family  life  with  her
    partner outside the UK. This was a finding open to (her) on  the  facts
    and is adequately reasoned. That being the case it is difficult to  see
    how the appellant could succeed either under the  rules  or  article  8
    outside the rules."

11. The judge was not obliged to have regard to what was then a yet  unborn
    child. Only on birth could that properly be taken  into  consideration.
    However, it was referenced by the judge  at  �14  of  the  decision  in
    relation to whether the appellant would be required  to  leave  at  her
    advanced stage of pregnancy. I am satisfied that to the degree to which
    the child could be taken into consideration the judge did so.

12. There is no merit in the grounds complaining by reference to �16 of the
    decision that there was no proportionality assessment. It is clear from
    �14 that the judge  made  it  clear  that  she  was  carrying  out  the
    proportionality balancing exercise, following the Razgar steps.  It  is
    thus incorrect to submit that the judge  confined  herself  to  seeking
    compelling and/or compassionate circumstances; a full  article  8  ECHR
    assessment was undertaken. The judge noted that family  life  has  been
    established at a time  when  the  appellant's  immigration  status  was
    precarious, even though legally present. The judge also found that  the
    evidence fell well short of  showing  that  there  were  insurmountable
    obstacles to Mr Minter relocating to the Philippines to continue family
    life there.

13. It had already been conceded that the  appellant  could  not  meet  the
    requirements of the Rules for leave to remain. The judge found that  Mr
    Minter failed to demonstrate that there  would  be  any  insurmountable
    obstacle to the couple relocating to the Philippines, which would  have
    been the test under EX1 of Appendix FM. In VW (Uganda)  v  SSHD  [2009]
    EWCA Civ 5, the Court of Appeal held that in assessing  proportionality
    under article 8 and whether an appellant's family should return to  his
    country of  origin  with  him,  the  test  is  not  whether  there  are
    insurmountable obstacles to prevent  their  going  but  whether  it  is
    reasonable to expect them to go. If there are insurmountable  obstacles
    they will succeed but if there are not they will not necessarily  fail.
    Pursuant to MA (Pakistan) v SSHD [2009] EWCA Civ 953 is only  necessary
    to ask whether the family can reasonably be expected to relocate.


14. In Chikwamba v SSHD [2008] UKHL 40, the House of  Lords  held  that  an
    appeal based on the Article 8 right to respect for family life  against
    a refusal of asylum should not be dismissed  routinely  because  policy
    required the  Appellant  to  leave  the  country  to  apply  for  entry
    clearance abroad. On the facts of that case the enforced return of  the
    Appellant to Zimbabwe, leaving behind her husband  and  child,  and  to
    remain there in harsh and unpalatable conditions  for  some  months  to
    await entry clearance and return at her own expense would have  gravely
    disrupted her family life.

15. I find, considering the decision as a whole,  that  there  was  a  full
    reasonableness assessment in relation to Mr Minter and the question  of
    the effect on his rights to respect for family  life  under  article  8
    ECHR if the appellant were to be removed to the Philippines. At �14 the
    judge noted that if she were removed he would continue to  support  her
    and their child and even support her application for  entry  clearance.
    The judge was entitled to take into  account  that  they  entered  into
    their relationship when her status in the UK was precarious,  and  went
    on to decide to have a child when she had been refused leave to remain.
    They had only  cohabited  as  a  couple  for  8  months,  although  the
    relationship dates back to October 2012. Mr  Chowdhury  was  unable  to
    point me to any feature of the relationship between the  appellant  and
    Mr Minter that the judge had overlooked.

16. Mr Minter told the judge he had not ruled out doing so,  perhaps  at  a
    later stage.  The  judge  considered  the  practical  possibilities  of
    relocation. In the absence of insurmountable obstacles,  the  appellant
    had to  show  that  removal  would  be  unjustifiably  harsh  as  being
    disproportionate to the rights of both the appellant and Mr Minter.  Mr
    Minter was not required to leave the UK, but he must be taken  to  have
    considered at the  time  of  entering  into  a  relationship  with  the
    appellant and in fathering a child that his partner may  well  have  to
    leave the UK and indeed could have had  no  legitimate  expectation  of
    being able to settle in the UK just because that was her desire or that
    she had entered into a relationship with a British citizen. This is not
    a Chikwamba case, as it is far from clear at  this  stage  whether  the
    appellant would be able to meet the requirements of the Rules for entry
    clearance as a partner under Appendix FM.  However, the  appellant  may
    consider a fresh application under Appendix FM on the  basis  of  their
    child being a British citizen and the  best  interests  of  that  child
    under section 55. That was not a matter which the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge could have considered at that stage, and it is not a matter which
    was before the Secretary of State when she made her decision.

17. Considering the decision of the First-tier Tribunal as a whole, I  find
    that the judge had properly considered the right  question,  which  was
    framed at the end of  �13:  "would  it  be  reasonable  to  expect  the
    appellant and Mr Minter to relocate to, in this case, the  Philippines?
    That is one the matters that I now seek  to  address."  The  assessment
    followed at �14 onwards.

Conclusions:

18. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed on all grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed and thus there can be no fee award.
