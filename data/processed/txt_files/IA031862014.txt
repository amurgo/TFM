Representation:
For the appellant:     Ms K Ojutiku, instructed by YY
For the respondent:    Mr I Jarvis, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Naranjan Kaur, date of birth 1.7.39,  is  a  citizen  of
    India.

 2. This is her appeal against the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Paul promulgated  1.10.14,  dismissing  her  appeal  against  the
    decision of the respondent, dated 11.12.13, to refuse leave  to  remain
    in the United Kingdom outside the Immigration Rules  on  the  basis  of
    human rights.  The Judge heard the appeal on 18.9.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Colyer  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    20.11.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 7.1.15 as  an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Paul should be set aside.

 6. In summary, the grounds of appeal   suggest  that  the  tribunal  judge
    erred in law:

      a) By misdirecting himself  on  article  8,  assessing  it  under  the
         constraints of Appendix FM when it was not essential to do so;

      b) By  failing  to  reference  any  of  the  compelling  circumstances
         justifying an article 8 assessment;

      c)  By  making  a  factual  error  at  �17,  by  concluding  that  the
         grandchildren were in India, when they are now in the UK, and  thus
         the adverse credibility findings are flawed;

      d) By failing to consider that the appellant  would  not  be  able  to
         return to the UK as an adult dependant relative  unless  and  until
         she requires  long-term personal care, which is a greater threshold
         to qualify under the Rules as opposed to the former requirement  in
         paragraph 370 of the Immigration Rules.

 7. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Colyer considered  it  arguable
    that the decision was influenced  by  the  comment  in  the  grandson's
    letter which relates to a possible erroneous finding that the appellant
    still had family in India. "This appears to have  been  an  influential
    fact  in  the  decision-making  by  the  judge.  The   representatives'
    submissions at the appeal indicate that there was  no  family  left  in
    India and the judge has not explained why he rejects that submission."

 8. "In the appeal the appellant's representative had raised the Chickwamba
    argument regarding proportionality when requiring someone to leave  the
    UK to make an application to return. It may be argued that  this  issue
    was not fully addressed by the Tribunal judge (for example at paragraph
    22). When considering the determination it is arguable that  the  judge
    has made a material error of law in the determination for  the  reasons
    outlined in  the  appellant's  application.  Permission  to  appeal  is
    granted."

 9. The Rule 24  response,  dated  1.12.14,  submits  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge directed himself appropriately and the grounds of appeal
    are a disagreement with the cogent findings. "The judge at paragraph 18
    questions  the  truthfulness  of  the  circumstances  claimed  by   the
    appellant and questions whether she does have other children  in  India
    and observes a lack of evidence at paragraph 20 on her claimed  medical
    needs."

10. It is further submitted that the judge did not err in  considering  the
    Immigration Rules first as the starting point  for  the  assessment  of
    article 8 private and family life. The Secretary of State asserts  that
    following Gulshan [2013] UKUT 00640 (IAC), once  the  Rules  have  been
    considered,  an  appeal  should  only  be  allowed  where   there   are
    exceptional circumstances as defined in Nagre [2013]  EWHC  720  Admin,
    meaning where refusal would lead to an unjustifiably harsh outcome. "In
    this case the Judge has found that the appellant's circumstances do not
    reveal any exceptional circumstances.  The  judge  considered  all  the
    evidence that was available to him and came to a conclusion open to him
    based on that evidence  and  the  relevant  rules  on  the  balance  of
    probability and the determination does not disclose any error."

11. There may have been a mistake of fact as to whether the  appellant  has
    any family remaining in India. However, on the information  put  before
    the judge it was reasonable to assume that there were grandchildren and
    thus family members in India. I find no material error in this  regard.



12. There is no merit in the Chikwamba point.  Chikwamba  appears  to  have
    turned on its own facts. The Court of Appeal in Hayat [2012]  EWCA  Civ
    1054, summarised the Chikwamba principles at �30, including that in  an
    article 8 a dismissal of the claim on the procedural  ground  that  the
    policy requires the applicant to make the application from outside  the
    UK may, but not  necessarily  will,  constitute  an  interference  with
    family or private life sufficient to engage article 8 and where article
    8 is engaged, it will be disproportionate  to  enforce  such  a  policy
    unless there is a  sensible  reason  for  doing  so.  This  is  a  fact
    sensitive issue which includes  certain  potentially  relevant  factors
    such as the prospective length and degree of disruption of family life.
    Where article 8  is  engaged  and  there  is  no  sensible  reason  for
    enforcing the policy, the decision maker should determine the article 8
    claim on its substantive merits, having regard to all material factors,
    notwithstanding that the  applicant  has  no  lawful  entry  clearance.
    Nothing in Chikwamba was intended to alter the way  the  courts  should
    approach substantive article 8 issues as laid down in such  well  known
    cases as Razgar and Huang.  In the view of the Court of Appeal, if  the
    Secretary of State has no sensible reason for requiring the application
    to be made from the home state, the fact that he has failed  to  do  so
    should not thereafter carry any weight in  the  substantive  article  8
    balancing exercise.

13. In the present case, and as observed by the judge at  �22,  it  is  far
    from clear  that  the  appellant  would  be  successful  in  making  an
    application for entry clearance from outside the UK. This is not a case
    where it is only the  application  of  the  policy  that  requires  the
    removal of the appellant.

14. However, for the reasons set out below, I find that  the  judge  should
    have gone on to conduct a careful article 8 ECHR assessment outside the
    Immigration Rules.


15. The judge may have had in mind Gulshan (Article 8 - new Rules - correct
    approach) [2013] UKUT 00640 (IAC) where the  Tribunal  set  out,  inter
    alia, that on the current state of the authorities:


          (b)    after applying the requirements of the Rules, only if there
         may be arguably good grounds for granting leave to  remain  outside
         them is it necessary for Article 8 purposes to go  on  to  consider
         whether  there  are  compelling  circumstances   not   sufficiently
         recognised under them: R (on the application of Nagre) v  Secretary
         of State for the Home Department [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin);

16. Although case law continues to develop, the current position is perhaps
    best expressed in paragraph 135 of  R (MM (Lebanon)) v SSHD [2014] EWCA
    Civ 985:

         135.  Where the relevant group of  IRs  [immigration  rules],  upon
         their proper construction provide a  "complete  code"  for  dealing
         with a person's Convention rights in the context of a particular IR
         or statutory provision, such as in the case of "foreign criminals",
         then the balancing exercise and the way the various factors are  to
         be taken into account  in  an  individual  case  must  be  done  in
         accordance with  that  code,  although  reference  to  "exceptional
         circumstances"   in   the   code   will   nonetheless   entail    a
         proportionality exercise.  But if the relevant group of IRs is  not
         such a "complete code" then the proportionality test will  be  more
         at large, albeit guided by the Huang tests and  UK  and  Strasbourg
         case law."

17. Recent decisions, including Ganesabalan [2014] EWHC 2712  (Admin)  have
    suggested that Appendix FM and paragraph  276ADE  are  not  a  complete
    code. It is probably also the case that regardless of  the  application
    of those provisions, the Tribunal is required to consider  and  address
    the grounds raised on appeal, pursuant to section 86 of the  2002  Act.
    Further,  there  was  a  one-stop  warning  in  the  refusal  decision,
    requiring  the  appellant  under  section  120   of   the   Nationality
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 to state all reasons why she should  be
    allowed to remain in the UK.

18. The judge found that there were no compelling features in the  case  to
    justify consideration of article  8  outside  the  Rules,  but  in  the
    alternative considered that even  if  wrong  on  that,  that  the  "any
    decision would  be  proportionate  on  these  facts."  That  is  not  a
    satisfactory  treatment  of  the  careful   proportionality   balancing
    exercise required by Razgar, between on the one hand the legitimate and
    necessary public interest in protecting the economic well-being of  the
    UK through immigration control and on the other, the private and family
    life rights of the appellant. There is a legal duty to give at least  a
    brief explanation of reasons  for  reaching  the  conclusion  that  the
    decision was proportionate. The parties would be unable to see from the
    determination what factors have been taken into account and weighed  in
    the balance. Neither has  the  judge  made  any  consideration,  as  is
    required by the statute, of the public interest factors in section 117B
    of the 2002 Act.

19. It may well be that on the facts of this  case  and  in  the  light  of
    section 117B, the outcome of the decision will be the same. However, in
    fairness the appellant and the respondent are entitled to clarity as to
    the  factors  taken  into  account  in  the  proportionality  balancing
    exercise.


20. When a decision of the First-tier Tribunal has been set aside,  section
    12(2) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 requires either
    that the case is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal  with  directions,
    or it must be remade by the Upper Tribunal. The scheme of the Tribunals
    Court and Enforcement Act 2007 does not assign the function of  primary
    fact finding to the Upper Tribunal. Where  the  facts  or  reasons  for
    findings are unclear on a crucial issue at the heart of an  appeal,  as
    they are  in  this  case,  effectively  there  has  not  been  a  valid
    determination of those issues. The errors of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    vitiates all other findings of fact  and  the  conclusions  from  those
    facts so that there has not been a valid determination of the issues in
    the appeal.

21. In all the circumstances, at the invitation and request of both parties
    to relist this appeal for a fresh hearing in the First-tier Tribunal, I
    do so on the basis that this is a case which falls squarely within  the
    Senior President's Practice Statement at paragraph 7.2. The  effect  of
    the error has been to deprive the appellant of a fair hearing and  that
    the nature or extent of any judicial fact finding  which  is  necessary
    for the decision in the appeal to  be  re-made  is  such  that,  having
    regard to the overriding objective in rule 2 to deal with cases  fairly
    and justly, including with the avoidance of delay, I find  that  it  is
    appropriate  to  remit  this  appeal  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to
    determine the appeal afresh.

Conclusion & Decision:

22. For the reasons set out herein, I find that the making of the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did involve the making  of  an  error  on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

     I set aside set aside the decision.

                    I remit the decision in the  appeal  to  the  First-tier
                    Tribunal to be remade afresh.

Consequential Directions

23. The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal at Taylor House;

24. The appeal should be listed for a full hearing, with a time estimate of
    2 hours;

25. No findings of fact are preserved and the appeal is to be heard afresh.



Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.




Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The outcome of the appeal remains to be decided.
