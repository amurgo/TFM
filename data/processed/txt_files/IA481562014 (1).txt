Representation
For the Appellant:     Mr C. Talacchi, Counsel instructed by Waran & Co
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr T. Melvin, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This appeal arises from the respondent's  decision  dated  10  November
    2014 to refuse the appellant's application for leave to remain  in  the
    UK on the basis of family and private life under Article  8  ECHR.  The
    appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal ("FtT") where his  appeal
    was dismissed by FtT Judge Oliver.

 2. The appellant, who is a citizen of Nigeria born on 20  September  1970,
    first entered the UK using another  person's  passport  on  14  October
    1995. His wife is a Nigerian citizen who entered the UK in  2004.  They
    have two children, both born in the UK. The eldest was born on 27  June
    2007 and the youngest on 31 January 2011. Neither the appellant nor his
    wife has valid leave to remain in the UK.

 3. The appellant made his application for leave  to  remain  on  19  March
    2012. This was refused in April 2013. Two requests for  reconsideration
    were made and refused and further submissions were made on  5  November
    2014. On 10 November 2014 the respondent made the  decision  to  refuse
    the appellant's application and to remove him and his three  dependents
    from the UK under Section 10 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999.

 4. The reason  given  by  the  respondent  for  refusing  the  appellant's
    application was that:

      a. he was unable to satisfy the requirements of  Appendix  FM  to  the
         Immigration Rules;

      b. he, his  wife  and  youngest  child  were  unable  to  satisfy  the
         requirements of Paragraph 276ADE(1);

      c. his eldest child was unable to satisfy the requirement of Paragraph
         276ADE(1)(iv) because although she met the duration requirement  of
         living continuously  in  the  UK  for  7  years  it  would  not  be
         unreasonable to expect her to leave the UK; and

      d. there were no exceptional circumstances to favour the appellant and
         his family being able to remain the UK.  In  assessing  exceptional
         circumstances the respondent addressed section 55 of  the  Borders,
         Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 and considered issues relating
         to access to education in Nigeria and  the  appellant's  childrens'
         exposure to the Nigerian community and culture.

 5. The appellant's appeal was heard by FtT Judge  Oliver.  The  respondent
    was not represented at the hearing. The decision of  the  FtT  is  very
    brief. At paragraphs [8]-[9] the judge sets out the appellant's and his
    wife's account of the relevant circumstances, although it is  not  made
    clear if these were accepted by the tribunal. The information contained
    in those paragraphs are that:

      a. The family enjoy English culture and education

      b. The appellant has no relatives in Nigeria other than distant family

      c. Only English is  spoken  in  the  home  and  the  children  do  not
         understand Yoruba (they have a limited vocabulary)

      d. They are not rich enough to send their children to  private  school
         in Nigeria

      e. The appellant survived by doing odd jobs and received  ï¿½50  a  week
         from an uncle but if allowed to remain would work long hours

      f. The appellant's wife is a fashion dress maker

      g. They live rent free and sometimes receive handouts from the mosque.
         The children receive food from a food bank.

 6. The FtT's analysis and reasons  are  set  out  in  a  single  paragraph
    (paragraph [12]), which states:

         "... neither the parents nor the younger child can possibly qualify
         under the rules and only the older  child  has  spent  seven  years
         here. The children are both of an age when they will find  it  easy
         to adapt to the life, customs  and  languages  of  Nigeria.  It  is
         overwhelmingly in the best interests of  both  children  to  remain
         with their parents, who have both shown no regard for the  laws  of
         this country. There are no exceptional circumstances which  require
         or permit me to consider the appeal outside the rules."

 7. The grounds of appeal assert that  the  FtT  failed  to  give  adequate
    consideration to, or assess the evidence concerning, the  circumstances
    of the eldest child given that she has been in the UK for  seven  years
    and thereby satisfies the duration requirement under both 276ADE(1)(iv)
    and section 117B(6) of the Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.
    Permission to appeal was granted on the basis that the reasons given in
    relation to the children are wholly generic and that there has  been  a
    failure to properly consider their best interests.

 8. Before me, Mr Talachi argued that the judge failed to engage with  what
    would be in the best interests of the children. In particular, there is
    no mention of their education and the difficulties in this regard  that
    would be faced in Nigeria. The only factor, in respect  of  their  best
    interests, mentioned by the FtT is that  it  would  be  in  their  best
    interests to remain with her parents, but  in  the  same  sentence  the
    judge has referred to the parents' disregard for  UK  immigration  laws
    which suggests he has taken into account factors he is not entitled to.

 9. Mr Melvin accepted that the decision  was  brief  but  noted  that  the
    respondent's refusal letter is detailed and covers the relevant  issues
    with a detailed consideration of the childrens' best interests and  why
    it would be reasonable for them to move with their parents to  Nigeria.
    The judge's decision is consistent with case law finding that the  best
    interests of young children are to return with their parents.

Consideration

10. For the reasons explained below, I find that the  decision  contains  a
    material error of law such that it must be set aside.

11. Where removal of a child from the UK is contemplated there  must  be  a
    fact specific and careful assessment of the best interests of a  child.
    As explained in EV (Philippines) and others [2014] EWCA Civ 874:

         "A decision as to what is in the best interests  of  children  will
         depend on a number of factors such as (a) their age; (b) the length
         of time that they have been here; (c) how long they  have  been  in
         education; (c) what stage their education has reached; (d) to  what
         extent they have become distanced from the country to which  it  is
         proposed that they return; (e) how renewable their connection  with
         it may be; (f) to what extent they will have linguistic, medical or
         other difficulties in adapting to life in that country; and (g) the
         extent to which the  course  proposed  will  interfere  with  their
         family  life  or  their  rights  (if  they  have  any)  as  British
         citizens."

12. The best interests analysis as  contemplated  by  EV  (Philippines)  is
    absent from the decision. The FtT concluded that "the children are both
    of an age when they will find it easy to adapt to the life, customs and
    languages of Nigeria". This may  be  true  but  there  are  no  factual
    findings to explain why the judge has reached the conclusion  that  for
    these children, in their particular and  specific  circumstances,  this
    would be the case. There are also no findings about their education  or
    the circumstances the family will likely face on  return.  Although  it
    may frequently be the case that it would be reasonable to expect  young
    children to leave the UK with both their parents who do  not  otherwise
    have a legal basis to remain  in  the  UK  (in  EV  (Philippines),  for
    example, it was considered reasonable), a  conclusion  on  this  cannot
    properly be reached without a fact specific analysis. That is what  the
    Court of Appeal found  the  first  tier  judge  had  undertaken  in  EV
    (Philippine) and it is what is  absent  from  the  decision  now  under
    appeal.  This is a material error which requires the decision to be set
    aside.

13. There are further errors in the decision. Although  it  is  not  stated
    explicitly, the decision reads as if  the  FtT  has  assumed  that  the
    appellant's eldest daughter satisfied the  duration  requirement  under
    paragraph  276ADE(1)(iv).  This,  however,  is  not  the  case.   Under
    276ADE(1)(iv) the daughter must have lived continuously in the  UK  for
    seven years at the date of application. The date of application was  19
    March 2012 and the daughter was born on 27 June 2007. She was  under  7
    years old at the date of the application and therefore  was  unable  to
    satisfy the Rules. The failure to recognise this was an error of law.

14. The FtT stated  at  paragraph  [12]  that  there  were  no  exceptional
    circumstances permitting it to consider the appeal outside  the  Rules.
    In so finding the FtT fell into error. Not only was the  FtT  permitted
    to consider the appeal outside the Rules, it was incumbent on it to  do
    so. The proper approach, in accordance with established  case  law,  is
    that upon  finding  that  neither  the  appellant  nor  his  dependents
    (including his eldest daughter) were able to  satisfy  the  Immigration
    Rules, the FtT should then  have  considered  the  appeal  outwith  the
    Rules, such analysis to include consideration of the factors stipulated
    in Section 117B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and
    the best interests of the appellant's children. It is  clear  that  the
    judge ought  to  have  had  regard,  in  particular,  to  117B(6),  the
    interpretation of which has recently been clarified in  Treebhawon  and
    others (section 117B(6)) [2015] UKUT 00674 (IAC).

15. Having regard to section  7.2(b)  of  the  Practice  Statement  of  the
    Immigration and Asylum Chambers of the First-tier and  Upper  Tribunal,
    and considering in particular the fact finding necessary in relation to
    the best interests of the appellant's children, I find that the  appeal
    should be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for re-making.

    Decision

      1. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains a  material  error
         of law such that it should be set aside in  its  entirety  and  the
         appeal heard afresh.

      2. The appeal is remitted  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  hearing
         afresh before a judge other than First tier Tribunal Judge Oliver.

      3. No anonymity order is made.
