Representation:
For the Appellant:     No appearance and unrepresented
For the Respondent:    Ms Johnstone (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants are citizens of China and are mother and daughters.  The
    appellants entered on a transit visa in June 2003 when the  second  and
    third appellants were aged 14 ï¿½ years old. They had all lived in Guyana
    since 1995 and returning there after a three-month visit to China. They
    overstayed beyond the terms of their visa, which  gave  them  leave  to
    remain until August 2003.

 2.  In  December  2004  the  first  appellant's  husband  (and  the  other
    appellants' father) entered the United Kingdom as a work permit  holder
    and  in  March  2005  the  first-appellant's  son  (second  and   third
    appellant's brother) joined him. The first-appellant's husband and  son
    were granted indefinite leave to remain in November 2009  and  in  2012
    they became British citizens. No application for indefinite  leave  was
    made for these appellants.

 3. On March 7, 2013 these appellants applied for leave to  remain  outside
    of the Rules under article 8 ECHR  but  the  respondent  refused  their
    applications on May 8, 2013. In February 2014 questionnaires were  sent
    requesting details of the appellants' relationships with persons in the
    United Kingdom and March 19, 2014  decisions  to  refuse  human  rights
    claims and claims under the Immigration Rules were made and a  decision
    to remove pursuant  to  Section  47  of  the  Immigration,  Asylum  and
    Nationality Act 2006 was issued in respect of all three appellants.

 4. The  appellants  appealed  under  section  82(1)  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 on April 2, 2014.

 5. The  matter  came  before  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Taylor
    (hereinafter referred to as the "FtTJ") on  July  22,  2014  and  in  a
    decision promulgated on August 4, 2014  he  dismissed  the  appellants'
    appeals under both the Immigration Rules and article 8 ECHR.

 6. The appellants lodged grounds of appeal on August 13,  2014.  Judge  of
    the First-tier Tribunal Saffer refused permission to appeal  on  August
    26, 2014 finding that the FtTJ made findings that were open to him.

 7. The appellants renewed their grounds  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  and  on
    December 16, 2014 Upper Tribunal Judge Lane granted permission  finding
    it was arguable the FtTJ had erred by firstly, not adequately addressed
    the possibility and consequences of the first appellant's husband being
    compelled to give up his British citizenship  in  order  to  re-acquire
    Chinese citizenship and  secondly,  the  analysis  of  "insurmountable"
    obstacles at paragraph [24] of the determination did not consider  that
    aspect of the matter.

 8. The respondent filed a Rule 24 response dated January 7,  2015  and  on
    January 15, 2015 a notice of hearing was sent by first  class  post  to
    both the appellants and their representatives.

 9. The matter came before me on the date set out above and  on  that  date
    there  was  no  appearance  by   either   the   appellants   or   their
    representatives.  Rule  5(3)(h)  of  the  Tribunal   Procedure   (Upper
    Tribunal) Rules 2008 allows me to adjourn or postpone a  hearing.  Rule
    36 of the 2008 Rules provides that notice  of  a  hearing  is  properly
    served if at least 14 days notice of the hearing date has  been  given.
    The notice of hearing was sent on January 15, 2015  and  therefore  the
    notices are deemed served in accordance with the  Rules.  None  of  the
    notices have been returned.

10. The appellants' representatives were contacted and in  response  to  my
    clerk's request as to why  neither  they  nor  their  clients  were  in
    attendance they faxed a letter. The representative wrote saying,

          "... In the last forty-five minutes I have been able to  ascertain
         that Mrs Su most certainly wishes to pursue the appeal.

         Unfortunately I have been unable to locate the file-although it may
         be with Counsel-who is presently in Court. Certainly if I has sight
         of the Notice of Hearing I would have  acted  upon  it  although  I
         cannot rule out the possibility of an  administrative  error  which
         frankly I need more time to investigate.

         I hope in the circumstances the Tribunal will be persuaded to grant
         a brief  adjournment  and  I  will  look  into  all  the  necessary
         enquiries"

11. In considering the adjournment request I have had regard  to  the  fact
    both notices of hearing had been properly served on both appellants  as
    well as their representatives.  The  representative's  letter  did  not
    assert  the  appellants  were  unaware  of  the  hearing  or  that  the
    representatives had not actually received the notice  of  hearing.  The
    letter stated the file was missing and an  administrative  error  could
    not be ruled out.

12. This was the appellant's appeal and their grounds were fully argued  in
    the grounds. Taking into account the notices were properly served,  the
    content of  the  representative's  letter  and  the  fact  I  have  the
    appellants' grounds of appeal I was satisfied  it  would  be  just  and
    reasonable to proceed with the hearing.

    ERROR OF LAW SUBMISSIONS

13. The appellants argued that the FtTJ had erred in his approach because:

      a. The FtTJ erred in his approach to paragraph 276ADE HC  395  in  the
         way he approached the issue of whether the appellants had any  ties
         including social, cultural or family with the country to which they
         would have  to  go.  The  appellants  had  only  visited  on  three
         occasions between them and this  could  not  constitute  "continued
         connection to life in that country".

      b. The FtTJ failed to give sufficient weight to the  fact  the  first-
         appellant's husband was now a British citizen  and  no  longer  had
         Chinese citizenship when  considering  "insurmountable  obstacles".
         The  FtTJ  also  failed  to  take  into  account  that  the  first-
         appellant's husband and son were British citizens with no right  to
         Chinese citizenship and who had resided in the United  Kingdom  for
         eleven years.

      c. The FtTJ should have had more regard to the fact  that  the  second
         and third appellants were  both  heavily  pregnant  and  unable  to
         travel and were not physically removable.

      d. There was no reliance no public funds by any of the appellants.

14. Ms Johnstone relied on the Rule 24 letter dated  January  7,  2015  and
    submitted:

      a. The submission on "ties" was an extraordinary simplification of the
         test in Ogundimu (article 8-new rules) [2013] UKUT  00060.  It  was
         not accepted the absence of physical presence was sufficient.

      b. The appellants did argue Article 9 of China  Nationality  Law  1980
         before the  FtTJ  but  in  any  event  at  paragraph  [24]  of  his
         determination  the  FtTJ  considered  firstly  whether  the  first-
         appellant's husband had lost his Chinese citizenship  and  secondly
         if he had  whether  he  would  experience  any  difficulties  being
         admitted as the spouse of a Chinese citizen. The FtTJ  found  there
         would  be  no  insurmountable  obstacles  and  in   reaching   that
         conclusion he had regard to the above.

      c.  The  first-appellant's  immigration  history  is  far  less   than
         exemplary.

      d. The practicalities of removal are not relevant to  considering  the
         issues under appeal.

15. I reserved my decision.

    ERROR OF LAW ASSESSMENT

16. The FtTJ had before him applications from three Chinese  citizens.  The
    first named appellant had arrived legally in June 2003  with  leave  to
    enter until August 2003. She failed to leave and at  the  time  of  the
    hearing before the FtTJ she had been here  illegally.  The  second  and
    third named appellants are twins and they came to  the  United  Kingdom
    with the first named appellant in June 2003 and they too  had  remained
    here illegally. When they arrived they were fourteen years of  age  but
    they have been living as adults since November 2006.

17. The husband/father arrived on a work permit in December  2004  and  the
    son/brother was admitted as a dependant in March  2005.  They  are  now
    British citizens having originally been  granted  indefinite  leave  to
    remain in 2009 (after the husband/father worked here for  five  years).
    The FtTJ noted that when an application for indefinite leave  was  made
    the appellants were not included in the application.

18. The FtTJ properly considered the  applications  under  the  Immigration
    Rules namely paragraph 276 ADE and Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules
    as well as under article 8 ECHR.

19. The FtTJ carefully set out the evidence given and  had  regard  to  the
    written documentation that was before him and from  paragraph  [21]  of
    his determination he set out his findings. It is  these  findings  that
    the appellants have challenged and they were given permission to appeal
    as set out above.

20. In paragraph [21] the FtTJ reminded himself  of  the  correct  test  to
    apply when he wrote "... in any event it is clear the test  I  have  to
    apply ... is whether there are "no ties",  this  to  be  taken  in  the
    Ogundimu sense of continued connection."

21. In other words the FtTJ did not apply the test suggested in the refusal
    letter but instead had regard to what was the leading case at that time
    on this issue and he made  clear  that  his  assessment  had  to  be  a
    "rounded assessment of all the relevant circumstances".

22. The FtTJ then proceeded separately to consider  the  first  appellant's
    position as well as the  second  and  third  appellant's  position.  In
    paragraph [21] the FtTJ found the first appellant had not lost ties and
    gave his  reasons.  In  paragraph  [22]  he  considered  the  remaining
    appellants' positions and concluded for good reason that they it  could
    not be said they had "no ties including social, cultural or family"  in
    China.

23. I therefore reject the ground of appeal raised in paragraphs [4] to [6]
    of the grounds of appeal.

24. The FtTJ then considered Appendix FM and in particular Section EX.1  in
    so far as it was relevant. In paragraph [23] the FtTJ set  out  factors
    he believed to be relevant. At paragraph [24] the FtTJ acknowledged the
    point  raised  in  paragraph  [7]  of  the  grounds.  The   appellants'
    representatives did not provide  any  evidence  that  demonstrated  the
    first-named  appellant's  husband  had  lost  his  citizenship   albeit
    reference is made in the grounds  of  appeal  to  Article  9  of  China
    Nationality Law 1980. The respondent properly makes the point this  was
    not raised at the hearing and this must be  correct  because  the  FtTJ
    made the point in paragraph [24] that  the  there  was  "no  direct  or
    persuasive evidence before me that the husband has  actually  lost  his
    citizenship". However, the FtTJ did not stop there because he then went
    onto consider the alternative scenario that he had and concluded  there
    was nothing to show he could not be admitted as the spouse of a Chinese
    citizen and he then considered "insurmountable obstacles".

25. The grounds of appeal contained in paragraph [7]  are  nothing  but  an
    attempt to re-argue the point and for the reasons I have given above in
    paragraph [24] I find there was no error in  law  in  his  approach  to
    insurmountable obstacles. If the appellants truly wish  to  argue  that
    ground then the onus is on them to put before the  respondent  evidence
    that supports their contention.

26. The FtTJ then  gave  his  reasons  why  he  felt  the  case  should  be
    considered outside of the Rules and whilst he had little sympathy  with
    the first-named appellant's position he accepted the second  and  third
    appellant's cases should be considered outside of the Rules.

27. At paragraph [28] he identified that the principal issue in the appeals
    was the issue of proportionality. He reminded  himself  correctly  that
    great weight has to be attached to the failure to meet Appendix  FM  or
    paragraph 276ADE and the fact that this was much more than  a  starting
    point. He applied what is now embodied in Section 117B of the 2002  Act
    and found all of the parties had developed private  lives  whilst  here
    unlawfully. He remarked that  the  husband/father  failed  to  disclose
    their  presence  despite  his  numerous  applications  after  2004.  He
    concluded in paragraph [29] that refusing the  first-named  appellant's
    application was not disproportionate.

28. The FtTJ had full regard to the remaining appellants'  situations  both
    of whom had  boyfriends  and  were  expecting  their  first  child.  He
    accepted that no blame should be attached  to  them  whilst  they  were
    minors but he found they had  built  up  their  current  private  lives
    (boyfriend and the fact they were expecting) not only  when  they  were
    over the eighteen but also after their applications had been refused in
    April 2013. In other words  they  established  their  current  statuses
    whilst their immigration  status  was  precarious.  The  FtTJ  attached
    weight to this factor.

29. The FtTJ considered their cases on the facts before him and found their
    removal, on those facts, was not disproportionate.

30. I see nothing wrong at all in the FtTJs approach and these appeals  are
    dismissed.

31. My decision may be academic because of  course  the  second  and  third
    appellants circumstances may  have  changed  due  to  their  developing
    relationships and circumstances but  those  are  matters  for  a  fresh
    application.

32. In conclusion I find there is no error in law.

Decision

33. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not disclose  an  error  in
    law and I uphold the original decision and I  dismiss  the  appellants'
    appeals.

34. Under Rule 14(1) The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (as
    amended)  an  appellant  can  be  granted  anonymity  throughout  these
    proceedings, unless and until a tribunal or court directs otherwise. No
    order was made in the First-tier and I see  no  reason  to  amend  that
    order.
