Representation:
For the Appellant:     Miss Haji (Counsel)
For the Respondent:    Mr Duffy (Senior Home Office Presenting Officer)

                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan  who  was  born  on  the  12th
       February 1990.  The  Appellant  has  sought  to  appeal  against  the
       decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Dhaliwal promulgated on the 5th
       May 2015, in which he dismissed the Appellant's  appeal  against  the
       Respondent's  decision  to  refuse  to  grant  the  Appellant   entry
       clearance to the United Kingdom, as a spouse of a person present  and
       settled in the United Kingdom under Appendix FM  of  the  Immigration
       Rules, and to dismiss the Appellant's appeal on Human Rights grounds.



    2. Within the  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Dhaliwal,  the
       Learned First-tier Tribunal Judge found that the Appellant failed  to
       meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules  under  Paragraph  EC-
       P.1.1, in that he found that the requirement that "The Appellant must
       be outside the UK", meant that the Appellant had to be outside of the
       United Kingdom in order to be able to apply for entry  clearance  and
       that in this case the Appellant was still in the United Kingdom  when
       he made his application online on the 14th February 2015 and did  not
       leave the United Kingdom until the 18th  February  2015.   First-tier
       Tribunal Judge Dhaliwal further found that although he had  not  seen
       the original letter from the Appellant's employer, the fact  that  an
       amended  employment  letter  had  been  submitted  by  the  Appellant
       containing additional information seemed to suggest that the original
       letter did not include the required information.  Further,  he  found
       that he was not allowed, as a matter of  law,  to  take  the  further
       evidence into account as he could not admit post-application evidence
       except  in  specific  circumstances  because  of  the  structure  and
       provisions of Appendix FM-SE.  The Judge  therefore  found  that  the
       provisions of Appendix FM-SE paragraph 2(b) were not met.  The  Judge
       however  did  find  that  the  Appellant  had  not  contrived  in   a
       significant way to frustrate the intentions of the Immigration  Rules
       by overstaying.

    3. The Appellant has sought to appeal  against  that  decision  for  the
       reasons set out within the Grounds of Appeal.  Within the Grounds  of
       Appeal, which is not repeated in full here  as  it  is  a  matter  of
       record, it is argued, inter alia, that the Appellant had provided  an
       Appellant's bundle in support of his appeal and that at pages 61  and
       62 is the Sponsor's employment letter submitted with the application,
       and that the Judge erred in not considering the same.  It  is  argued
       that there was no missing evidence as required under the  Immigration
       Rules when the documentation at pages 61 and 62  are  considered  and
       that the documentation submitted with the application  confirmed  the
       particulars of employment.  It is further argued within  the  Grounds
       of Appeal that the Appellant had stated in his covering  letter  that
       his online application was submitted on the  14th  February  2014,  4
       days prior to  his  voluntary  departure  to  Pakistan  on  the  18th
       February 2014, and that the Appellant at the time of  submitting  his
       application  online  had  booked  an  appointment   to   submit   his
       application in Pakistan on the 27th February 2014  and  that  if  the
       Judge were not minded to accept the date of application as being  the
       date of submissions of the documents on the 27th  February  2014,  it
       was argued that this was the only shortcoming in the application  and
       that this was a minor defect/omission and that following the case  of
       Sultana and Others (rules: waiver/further enquiry; discretion) [2014]
       UKUT 00540 (IAC) that this was a minor defect which should not suffer
       the draconian fate  of  refusal  and  that  the  judge's  failure  to
       recognise that amounted to an error of law.

    4. Permission to appeal has been granted by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
       Gillespie on the 27th September 2016, who found that:

           "2.    It is proposed as a ground of appeal that the  First-tier
           Tribunal Judge failed to consider an  employer's  letter  placed
           before her and wrongly concluded that she had not been  afforded
           sight of it, whereas in fact it was present  and  indexed  in  a
           bundle of documents submitted.

           3. This, if established, would amount to an error  of  law  that
           might  arguably  be  material.   This  alleged  error  of   law,
           irrespective of  any  others  raised,  is  fairly  arguable  and
           therefore permission is granted."

    5. Within the Respondent's Rule 24 Reply, dated the 11th  October  2016,
       it is argued that the judge directed himself appropriately  and  that
       the judge found that the Appellant could not meet the requirements of
       the Immigration Rules as the Appellant was not outside of the  UK  at
       the time of the application and that even if  the  employment  letter
       was submitted in accordance with Appendix FM-SE, the Appellant  could
       not meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules.

    6. It was on that basis that the appeal came  before  me  in  the  Upper
       Tribunal.

    7. In considering this appeal, I  have  carefully  considered  the  oral
       submissions of both Miss Haji on behalf of the Appellant  and  of  Mr
       Duffy, on behalf of the Respondent.  A  full  record  of  their  oral
       submissions is contained with the  record  of  proceedings,  and  are
       therefore not repeated in their entirety here.

    8. In respect of the question regarding the employer's letter, Mr  Duffy
       on behalf of the Respondent, properly conceded that the reference  by
       First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Dhaliwal  to  him  having  considered  an
       amended employment letter but not having had sight  of  the  original
       letter at [22], seemed to indicate that the judge had considered  the
       Sponsor's amended employment letter dated the 16th March 2016 at page
       13 of the Appellant's bundle, but had  not  taken  into  account  the
       original Sponsor's employment letter at page 61,  nor  the  Sponsor's
       contract of employment between pages 62 and  73  of  the  Appellant's
       bundle.  What was said in the index to the bundle to be the Sponsor's
       amended employment letter dated the 16th March 2016 at page 13, is in
       fact entitled employment reference, and clearly  postdates  both  the
       date of application and the  date  of  decision,  the  Appellant  had
       clearly submitted, and the Judge was correct in not  considering  the
       same.

    9. However, there  was  contained  within  the  Appellant's  bundle,  an
       original Sponsor's employment letter which was entitled "Re: mortgage
       reference" which set out that the Sponsor had been working for Wright
       Management from the  19th  May  2014,  the  job  title  was  a  Legal
       Information  Specialist,  Workplace  Wellness  and  that  it  was   a
       permanent role and that her current salary was �20,000 per annum  and
       that she was paid monthly by means of bank transfer.  The document at
       page 62 contained within the Appellant's bundle was a letter  to  the
       Sponsor dated the 1st December 2014, indicating that there had been a
       change from her temporary to a permanent contract, which took  effect
       from the 1st November 2014, but that all other terms  and  conditions
       of the employment remained unchanged.   The  contract  of  employment
       started at page 63, and provided that originally she was going to  be
       subject to a 6 month probationary period starting  on  the  19th  May
       2014 with her working as a legal information specialist,  and  giving
       her hours of work as 37.5 hours per week, with her being paid monthly
       in arrears on or round the 20th of each calendar month at a  rate  of
       �20,000 per annum, by means of direct transfer.

   10. It is clear, having read the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
       Dhaliwal, that as far as he was concerned he had not had sight of the
       original letter, as stated by him at [22], but he went  on  to  state
       that the very  fact  that  an  amended  employment  letter  had  been
       submitted by the  Appellant  containing  the  additional  information
       seemed to suggest the original letter did not  include  the  required
       information.  Although the judge properly considered  that  he  could
       not take account of the amended  employment  letter  dated  the  16th
       March 2016, as this was not submitted with the application, Miss Haji
       on behalf of the Appellant contended that the documents between pages
       61 and 73, being the original contract from May 2014, the  letter  at
       page 62 confirming that there had been a change from a temporary to a
       permanent contract in the letter dated the 27th  November  2014,  and
       the letter dated the 22nd  January  2015,  were  submitted  with  the
       application, when the Appellant filed his documentation  in  Pakistan
       on the 27th February.

   11. Mr Duffy in this regard conceded that certainly the documentation  at
       page 61 was before the Entry Clearance Officer, as the refusal letter
       referred to the Appellant having  submitted  a  "mortgage  reference"
       which was the title to the document at page 61 and that that document
       predated  the  application.   Mr  Duffy  further  conceded  that  the
       Respondent had not taken the point  that  the  documents  which  were
       considered by the Entry Clearance Officer, were submitted in Pakistan
       on the 27th February, at the appointment arranged for  the  Appellant
       to submit his documentation, rather than at the time when the  button
       was pressed to submit the application online.  He further stated that
       he was not taking any point in that regard and  that  such  documents
       had been validly submitted and could and should have been considered.

   12. In  such  circumstances,  I  do  find  that  regrettably,  First-tier
       Tribunal Judge Dhaliwal, has erred in law in failing to take  account
       of material evidence, in that although clearly he appears to have had
       sight of the amended employment letter dated the 16th March  2016  at
       page 13  of  the  Appellant's  bundle,  he  has  not  considered  the
       Sponsor's employment letter at page 61 of the bundle dated  the  22nd
       January 2015, nor the letter dated the 27th November 2014 at page 62,
       indicating that the Sponsor's employment had changed from a temporary
       to a permanent contract but the other terms and  conditions  remained
       unchanged, or the  contract  of  employment  itself,  in  considering
       whether or not the provisions of Appendix FM-SE 2(b) were met.

   13. Further, given the concession by Mr Duffy that the document  at  page
       61 entitled mortgage reference make it  clear  that  the  job  was  a
       permanent role, I do find that the provisions of paragraph  2(b)(iv),
       were met in that the letter at page  61  had  set  out  the  type  of
       employment being a permanent contract.  Further, Mr Duffy again quite
       properly conceded that he was not taking any point as to  whether  or
       not the requisite information had been  contained  in  just  1  or  2
       documents, and having heard from Miss Haji,  I  do  accept  that  the
       documents at pages 61, 62 and  63  to  73  were  submitted  with  the
       application when the documents were submitted on  the  27th  February
       2015 and it is further clear, when considering the entirety  of  that
       documentation in terms of the original contract of  employment  which
       set out the rate of pay  during  the  probationary  period  as  being
       �20,000 per year, the letter regarding the  change  of  temporary  to
       permanent contract indicating that all  other  terms  and  conditions
       remained unchanged, and of the letter dated the  22nd  January  2015,
       that her current salary at that  stage  was  �20,000  per  year.  The
       Appellant had produced evidence, which I accept was before the  Entry
       Clearance Officer, which indicated the period over which she had been
       paid the level of salary relied upon in the application, namely  that
       the Sponsor had been paid �20,000, since starting her employment.  Mr
       Duffy indicated specifically that he was  not  seeking  to  take  the
       point that the employer's letter from January  had  not  specifically
       stated the period over which she had been paid the  level  of  salary
       relied upon in the application, given that that information could  be
       gleaned from the documentation which had been supplied  in  terms  of
       the contract of employment, the letter of change  from  temporary  to
       permanent employment and the letter from January 2015.

   14. I therefore do find that the judge materially  erred  in  failing  to
       take account of relevant evidence in this regard, I further find that
       had he done so, the judge would have found that the  requirements  of
       Paragraph E-ECP.3.3 were met, and that the Appellant and the  Sponsor
       had satisfied the requirements of Appendix FM-SE(2)(b).

   15. In respect of the argument that the Judge materially erred in finding
       that the Appellant was not outside the UK on the date of  application
       at [20] it  is  clear  from  the  wording  of  Appendix  FM-SE,  that
       documents sought to be relied upon  under  Appendix  FM  have  to  be
       submitted with the application. The application itself in  this  case
       was made in February 2015. The decision was dated the 12th May  2015.
       As a result of the transitional provisions, the old right  of  appeal
       applied such that the Judge was  considering  the  appeal  under  the
       Immigration Rules and thereafter, outside the Rules under Article  8.
       The  Judge  was  considering  the  application  for  entry  clearance
       pursuant to Section 85(4) of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum
       Act 2002, and that the Judge was therefore under a duty  to  consider
       whether or not the  Rules  were  met  based  upon  the  circumstances
       appertaining as at the date of the decision, even though, in  respect
       of the specified evidence requirements, that such documents had to be
       submitted with the application.  There is a difference in this regard
       between the date when documents have to be  submitted  and  the  date
       when the Rules per se have to be met.

   16. The wording of Paragraph EC-P.1.1, states that for entry clearance as
       a partner (a) the Appellant must be outside of the UK. This has to be
       considered, as at the date of the decision and as at the date of  the
       Respondent's decision, as conceded by Mr  Duffy,  the  Appellant  was
       outside of the UK.  There is nothing within the wording of  Paragraph
       EC-P.1.1, to state that "The Applicant must be outside of the UK,  as
       at the date of application", and given that the application is  being
       considered as at the  date  of  the  decision,  and  given  that  the
       Appellant was outside of the UK as at the date  of  the  decision,  I
       find that the  judge  further  erred  in  law  in  finding  that  the
       Appellant failed to satisfy the requirements of the Immigration Rules
       pursuant to Paragraph EC-P.1.1.

   17. In my judgement, the Appellant did meet the requirements of Paragraph
       EC-P.1.1(a), as he was outside of the UK, at the date of the decision
       by the Respondent.  Mr Duffy was unable to point me to  any  case  or
       authority, to indicate that Paragraph EC-P.1.1(a) should be  read  to
       include the words "as at the date of application", and that the usual
       provision that the entry clearance application should  be  considered
       as at the date of decision, should be disapplied.  I  therefore  find
       that First-tier Tribunal Judge Dhaliwal did materially err in law, in
       finding that the Appellant had to be outside of the UK as at the date
       of the application.

   18. The decision of First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Dhaliwal  therefore  does
       contain material errors in law, and is set aside to the  extent  that
       he found that the Appellant did not  meet  the  requirements  of  the
       Immigration Rules.  However, I do maintain the judge's  findings  and
       reasoning in respect of  the  finding  that  the  Appellant  had  not
       contrived in a significant way to frustrate  the  attentions  of  the
       Immigration  Rules  by   overstaying,   as   that   finding   remains
       unchallenged.

   Remaking

   19. It was agreed by both parties before me that it  was  appropriate  in
       the circumstances of this case for me to remake the decision  in  the
       Upper Tribunal, rather than the case being remitted back to the First-
       tier Tribunal for rehearing.

   20. As set out in my findings above and for the reasons I  have  set  out
       above, I do accept and find as a fact having heard  from  Miss  Haji,
       that the original Sponsor's employment letter from January 2015,  the
       previous letter from November regarding the change from her temporary
       employment to full-time employment and the employment  contract  were
       submitted when the Appellant submitted his documents in  Pakistan  on
       the 27th February 2015.  Given the concessions made by  Mr  Duffy  on
       behalf of the Respondent that it is sufficient that  the  information
       necessary for the purposes of Appendix FM-SE paragraph  2(b)  can  be
       gleaned from the information submitted in respect  of  the  Sponsor's
       employment, I do find both that the  original  Sponsor's  letter  did
       state that the Sponsor's employment was on a permanent basis and that
       it also did set out the amount of salary and it was  clear  from  the
       documentation submitted the period for which  that  salary  had  been
       payable, namely from the start of her probationary period, being  the
       start of employment with Wright Management.  Given that Mr Duffy  did
       not seek to argue that the letter was defective in  not  stating  the
       period of employment itself, given  that  he  conceded  that  it  was
       sufficient if the information could be gleaned from the documentation
       submitted, and further, given that Mr Duffy did not  take  the  point
       and conceded that the documentation was properly submitted and  could
       be considered, despite having been submitted in Pakistan on the  27th
       February 2015, I do accept and find as a fact that the provisions  of
       Appendix FM-SE in respect of the employment letter were met.

   21. Further, as set out above, given that on my findings,  the  Appellant
       was outside of the UK, as at the date of decision,  the  requirements
       of Paragraph EC-P.1.1, were also met.

   22.  In  such  circumstances,  I  remake  the  decision,   allowing   the
       Appellant's appeal under the Immigration Rules.

Notice of Decision

The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Dhaliwal contains material  errors
of law and is set aside to the extent set out above.

I remake the decision allowing the Appellant's appeal under the  Immigration
Rules.

No anonymity direction was made by the  First-tier  Tribunal,  and  no  such
order was sought before me.  I therefore do  not  make  any  such  anonymity
order in this case.
