Representation

For the Appellant:     Mr S Kandola, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr V Onuegbu, (Ovo Solicitors)

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. For the sake of convenience I shall refer to  the  appellant  as  "the
      entry clearance officer" and the respondent as "the claimant."


   2. The claimant is a national of Cameroon, born on  12th  February  1969.
      His appeal against the decision of the entry clearance  officer  dated
      2nd April 2013 to refuse to grant him entry clearance to the UK as the
      spouse of his sponsor, Mrs Agnes Foumbi Takwi, was allowed  under  the
      Immigration  Rules  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge   Clayton   in   a
      determination promulgated on 9th June 2014.


   3. In the reasons for refusal, the entry  clearance  officer  noted  that
      under the rules he needed to show his sponsor had a gross income of at
      least ï¿½18,600 per annum. He had provided three payslips dated  August,
      September and November 2012 and a Lloyds  bank  statement  dated  from
      27th July 2012 until 26th September 2012.


   4. Whilst acknowledging  that  he  had  provided  some  of  the  required
      evidence,  he  had  failed  to  provide  all  the  required  specified
      documents relating to his sponsor's employment.  Accordingly,  he  had
      not demonstrated that his sponsor had received the required  financial
      income.


   5. Furthermore, the claimant was not exempt  from  the  English  language
      requirement under paragraph E-ECP.4.2. He provided no evidence that he
      had undertaken a test from the UKBA's  approved  test  providers.  His
      application was accordingly also refused under ECP.1.1(d) of FM.


   6. Judge Clayton found that the claimant had  shown  on  the  balance  of
      probabilities  that  both  he  and  the  sponsor  intended   to   live
      permanently with each other as spouses and  that  their  marriage  was
      subsisting [13].


   7. Insofar as the financial requirements  were  concerned,  she  had  had
      regard to the date of refusal, namely 2nd April  2014.  The  sponsor's
      P60 was up to the tax year ending 5th April 2013. It therefore covered
      the relevant period. It was not possible for this to be placed  before
      the entry clearance officer as it would have been  issued  some  weeks
      after the end of the tax year.


   8. The Judge found that  although  the  P60  was  not  before  the  entry
      clearance officer, it shed light on the situation "at the  time."  The
      claimant provided payslips for August, September and November 2012 and
      a bank statement for the period from the 27th July 2012  to  the  26th
      September 2012. The  P60  clarified  the  situation  at  the  date  of
      application,  namely  4th  February  2013.  That  she  found  was   an
      admissible document. She therefore found that  the  sponsor  fulfilled
      the financial requirements.


   9. Insofar as  the  English  language  requirements  are  concerned,  she
      accepted the sponsor's evidence that the specific facilities were  not
      available in Cameroon for the  claimant  to  undertake  the  test  but
      immediately after refusal he was able to obtain an IELTS  test  report
      form. This showed an overall band score of 5.5. Accordingly, the Judge
      was satisfied on the  balance  of  probabilities  that,  although  not
      exempt from the English language requirement,  the claimant's  English
      was of a sufficient standard to meet the requirements of  EC-P1.1  (d)
      of Appendix FM.


  10. The appeal was allowed under  the  Immigration  Rules  and  the  Judge
      directed that settlement be granted forthwith. In addition, a full fee
      award was made.


  11. On 21st July 2014, First-tier Tribunal Judge Colyer granted the  entry
      clearance officer's application  for  permission  to  appeal.  It  was
      arguable  that  the  Judge  had  paid  insufficient  regard   to   the
      comprehensive requirements set out  in  Appendix  FM-SE;  whereas  the
      claimant had submitted some documentation this had not  satisfied  the
      requirements of that  Appendix  and  no  adequate  reasons  for  those
      findings  had  been  given.  In  addition,  the  Judge  had  not   had
      appropriate  regard  to  the  relevant  date,  namely  the   date   of
      application.


  12. Mr Kandola applied, without opposition, to include a further ground in
      the light of the Judge's finding at paragraph  15,  that  the  English
      language requirements had been met. The English language  test  report
      was produced after the date of refusal. The  entry  clearance  officer
      had in fact asserted  that  the  failure  to  produce  such  a  report
      constituted an additional ground of refusal. The evidence tendered was
      post- decision evidence and  accordingly  on  that  ground  alone  the
      application was bound to fail under the rules.


  13. With regard to  the  financial  requirements,  although  the  claimant
      provided some payslips and bank statements, these did  not  cover  the
      relevant period required under the rules, namely six months  prior  to
      the date of application. The requirement is set out in Appendix  FM-SE
      which provides that wage slips must cover a period of six months prior
      to the date of application where the claimant has been employed by his
      current employer for at least six months.


  14. Further, there must be a letter  from  the  employer  who  issued  the
      payslips, confirming his  employment  and  gross  annual  salary;  the
      length of his employment; the period over which he  has  been  or  was
      paid the level of salary relied upon in the application; and the  type
      of employment (permanent, fixed term contract  or  agency).  Moreover,
      there must be a signed  contract  of  employment  for  the  employment
      currently held and monthly personal bank statements  corresponding  to
      the same period as the wage slips showing that  the  salary  has  been
      paid into the account in the name of the person or in the name of  the
      person and their partner jointly.


  15. The First-tier Judge had referred to  the  production  of  only  three
      payslips for August, September and November 2012. The claimant however
      needed to show payslips  up  until  February  2013.  As  to  the  bank
      statements, the Judge referred to a bank statement from Lloyds between
      27th July 2012 and 26th September 2012. There  was  however  no  money
      going into  that  statement  and  accordingly,  they  were  not  of  a
      corroborative  nature  required  in  fulfilment   of   the   financial
      requirements.


  16. It is clear from Appendix FM-SE, dealing with  evidence  of  financial
      requirements under Appendix FM, that in respect of salaried employment
      in the UK,  all  the  evidence  specified  in  paragraph  2  "must  be
      provided." That includes the P60 for the relevant period,  if  issued.
      However, the other documents such as  wage  slips,  letters  from  the
      employer, a signed contract and the personal monthly  bank  statements
      corresponding to the same periods as the wage slips must be produced.


  17. Accordingly, the P60 submitted was not sufficient. Nor had  the  other
      relevant documentation required been provided and no reason  given  to
      explain why such  documentation  had  not,  or  could  not  have  been
      provided.


  18. Insofar as Article 8 is concerned the claimant cannot meet  the  rules
      which constitutes a "weighty factor" to be  taken  into  account.   He
      submitted that  the  remedy  is  to  make  a  further  application  in
      compliance with the rules and appendices.


  19. On behalf of the claimant, Mr Onuegbu submitted that the "decision was
      open to the Judge."  It was based on the available evidence.  The  P60
      was sufficient evidence in the circumstances. The P60 deals  with  all
      the relevant circumstances raised in the rules and Appendix FM-SE. The
      P60 produced related to the tax year up to 5th April  2013.  In  other
      words,  from  31st  March  2012,  the  sponsor  was   in   employment.
      Accordingly the six months requirement with regard to other  documents
      was "misconceived."   He also submitted that a P60  can  constitute  a
      letter from the employer.  He submitted that  "Appendix  FM-SE  is  an
      overkill."


  20.  Accordingly, the P60 is conclusive of everything required by Appendix
      FM-SE and the Judge was entitled to rely pursuant  to  her  discretion
      under s.85(4) of the 2002 Act that as at the date of  the  application
      the claimant had satisfied the requirements.  Accordingly,  the  entry
      clearance officer's submissions amount to a "mere  disagreement"  with
      the findings of the Judge.


  21. He also submitted that pursuant to paragraph 1(k) of  Appendix  FM-SE,
      the entry clearance officer  should  normally  refuse  an  application
      which does  not  provide  the  evidence  specified  in  the  appendix.
      However, where documents have been submitted, but  not  as  specified,
      and the entry clearance  officer  considers  that,  if  the  specified
      documents were submitted, it would result in  a  grant  of  leave,  he
      should  contact  the  applicant  or  representative  in  writing,   or
      otherwise, to request  that  such  documents  be  submitted  within  a
      reasonable time frame. Examples of such  documents  submitted  not  as
      specified include: a document missing  from  a  series,  e.g.  a  bank
      statement; a document in the wrong format; or a  document  that  is  a
      copy rather than the original. He submitted that the  claimant  should
      have been given an appropriate opportunity in the circumstances.


  22. With regard to the English language  test,  there  had  been  no  test
      centre established in Cameroon, but merely in Ghana. Accordingly,  the
      claimant was exempted from meeting the requirement under the rule.


  23. Mr Kandola in reply submitted that pursuant to  paragraph  281(ii)  of
      the rules, one of the requirements to be met by a person seeking leave
      to enter with a view to settlement as the spouse is that  he  provides
      an  original  English  language  test  certificate  in  speaking   and
      listening from an English  language  test  provider  approved  by  the
      Secretary of State for these purposes.  There  are  "exemptions."  For
      example, if the claimant is aged 65 or over at the time he  makes  his
      application; or the  claimant  has  a  physical  or  mental  condition
      preventing his meeting that  requirement;  or  there  are  exceptional
      circumstances  that  would  prevent  the  claimant  from  meeting  the
      requirements, or he is a national of one of the countries specified.


  24. Cameroon is not such a country.  Nor  has  the  claimant  obtained  an
      academic qualification  seen  by  UK  NARIC  to  meet  the  recognised
      standard of a bachelors or Masters degree or PhD in the UK.


  25. Further, Mr Kandola referred to the claimant's application form and in
      particular questions 73  and  74  relating  to  the  English  language
      requirement. The claimant was asked whether he  was  exempt  from  the
      English language requirement to which he replied  "no."  He  was  then
      asked  to  provide  details  of  how  he  met  the  English   language
      requirement to which he answered "I come from English speaking part of
      Cameroon." Accordingly, Mr Kandola submitted that  even  the  claimant
      himself had not claimed to be entitled to any exemption.


  26. Mr Kandola submitted that given  that  the  documents  were  not  even
      produced before the Judge, even assuming that  an  opportunity  should
      have been given to the claimant under paragraph 1(k) of  Appendix  FM-
      SE, this would not have resulted in a grant of leave.


  27. Furthermore, the English language test was in any event taken almost a
      year after the date of the decision in this case. Mr Kandola submitted
      that new evidence was not able to be led in this case having regard to
      the provisions of s.85A(2) of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum
      Act 2002: the immigration decision appealed against, namely  an  entry
      clearance application, was "of a kind specified in  s.82(2)(b)"  where
      the Tribunal may consider only the circumstances appertaining  at  the
      time of the decision.


     Assessment


  28. The claimant failed to provide the required specified evidence showing
      his sponsor's income from  employment.  That  included  the  full  six
      months' payslips and corresponding bank statements as well as a letter
      from his employer containing the required information.


  29. The First-tier Tribunal Judge was aware  that  the  claimant  had  not
      provided all the payslips required or a  bank  statement  showing  the
      corresponding payments into the account  from  earnings.  She  however
      admitted the P60, finding it to be "an admissible  document."  It  had
      not been possible for this to be placed  before  the  entry  clearance
      officer as it was only issued some weeks after  the  end  of  the  tax
      year.


  30. It is a requirement in any event under Appendix FM-SE that the P60 for
      the relevant period of  employment  relied  on,  if  issued,  must  be
      submitted. However, it is also clear from paragraph  2  that  all  the
      evidence identified in the Appendix relating  to  salaried  employment
      must be produced. Such evidence however was not produced.


  31. I reject the  submission  that  the  P60  can  act  as  some  kind  of
      substituting document containing all the information required.  It  is
      simply one of several documents that must be  provided.  The  relevant
      paragraph does not excuse the production of  all  the  other  evidence
      required in sub-paragraph (c) to (f). If  the  P60  alone  would  have
      sufficed, that would have been expressly stated in the paragraph.


  32. The claimant himself accepted in  his  application  that  he  was  not
      exempt from complying with the English language test requirements.   I
      find  that  the  Judge  wrongly  admitted  evidence  relating  to  the
      claimant's IELTS report for the reasons already referred to.


  33. Finally, I do not find that the entry clearance  officer  was  in  the
      circumstances obliged to contact the claimant in  writing  to  request
      that the specified documents be submitted.


  34. I accordingly find that the claimant had  not  produced  the  evidence
      required to be produced and which has been comprehensively set out  in
      Appendix FM-SE to the immigration rules.


  35. Nor did the documents which he did supply cover the relevant period as
      required under the rules. Nor had the Tribunal addressed the  relevant
      evidence from prior to 7th  February  2013,  which  was  the  date  of
      application.


     Decisions


      I set aside the determination of the First-tier Tribunal Judge and re-
      make the decision, dismissing the claimant's appeal.


     I set aside the direction given by the Judge that  entry  clearance  be
granted  forthwith.


     I set aside the fee award that was made.
