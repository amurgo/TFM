Representation:

For the Appellants:    Mr Layne
For the Respondent:    Mr Kandola

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellants are citizens of Jamaica.  They are a mother and her  two
    daughters born in 1979, 1994 and 1999 respectively.

 2. The history, which is not in  dispute,  is  that  the  first  Appellant
    arrived in the UK in August 1999 as a visitor,  apparently  accompanied
    by the third Appellant who was about 4 months old.   In  November  1999
    the second Appellant joined them, also as a visitor.  In February  2000
    the first Appellant was granted leave to  remain  as  a  student.   Her
    application included the third Appellant as a dependant,  but  made  no
    reference to the second Appellant.

 3. In June 2000 and again in March 2002, the  first  Appellant  (hereafter
    simply 'the Appellant') was convicted of theft by shoplifting  and  was
    given a conditional discharge and a �600 fine respectively.

 4. On 21 October 2003, the Appellant married Mr Adeyemi Talabi, a Nigerian
    national who was naturalised as a British citizen  in  May  1996.   The
    marriage took place in Jamaica.  The following day the first  Appellant
    applied for  entry  clearance  on  the  basis  of  her  marriage.   The
    application was refused and her  subsequent  appeal  was  unsuccessful.
    Nevertheless, the Appellant returned to the UK anyway (apparently using
    a false passport) and in November 2004 her son, Akeem Talabi  was  born
    in the UK.

 5. Since returning to the UK she has  accumulated  the  following  further
    convictions.  In July 2006 theft by  shoplifting:  fined  �100;  August
    2008 handling stolen goods: two  year  conditional  discharge;  January
    2010 two counts of theft by  shoplifting  and  one  of  breach  of  her
    conditional discharge: fined �50 in respect of each charge.

 6. In February 2010 she was  convicted  of  multiple  offences  concerning
    deception.  The offences involved obtaining two British  passports  and
    other identity documents in  false  names  which  she  used  to  obtain
    immigration status and employment.  She also committed  benefit  fraud.
    She was sentenced to a total period of two years imprisonment.

 7. In March 2010 following her last conviction the  Appellant  was  served
    with a notice of liability to automatic deportation.  In June 2010  she
    submitted an application for further leave to remain.  That application
    was refused, but the refusal was withdrawn after  representations  were
    received in relation to Article 8 of the ECHR.

 8. In November 2012 the Respondent issued the  Appellant  with  a  further
    notice of liability to automatic deportation and on 14 June 2013 made a
    deportation order against her under section 32(5) of the UK Borders Act
    2007.  Deportation orders were also made in  respect  of  the  children
    Talisa and Saphire as her dependants.  Although  Talisa  was  19  years
    old, she still lives with her mother and was treated as  her  dependant
    for these purposes.  No issue was taken with that approach.

 9. They appealed successfully against the deportation decisions but on  10
    March 2014 that decision was set aside by the Upper  Tribunal  and  the
    case was remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be reheard afresh.

10. Following a rehearing at Taylor House on 31  July  2014  Judge  of  the
    First-tier Scott allowed the appeal under the Immigration Rules and  on
    human rights grounds.

11. He noted the evidence of  the  Appellant.   In  summary,  she  suffered
    sexual abuse and physical violence in Jamaica before she  came  to  the
    UK.  Except for the short period in  2003  when  she  returned  to  get
    married she has lived in the UK continuously. The children  Talisa  and
    Saphire have never been back to Jamaica having been here from the  ages
    of 4 years and 4 months respectively.

12. In addition she now has two further children by her  husband,  born  in
    the UK and British citizens.  They are Akeem, now aged 9  and  Kayshell
    now aged 8 months.  Her husband has two adult children from  his  first
    marriage, a son of about  23  and  a  daughter  of  about  21  whom  he
    continues to support financially.

13. She has always accepted her guilt and  her  punishment,  and  while  in
    prison reflected on her  life  especially  when  she  was  without  her
    children and resolved never to be involved in crime again.  Her husband
    has had a positive influence on her and  she  has  not  offended  since
    coming out of prison.

14. All three of the Appellants have overstayed without leave for  most  of
    their time here.  They did so when the college which the Appellant  was
    attending closed down and she did not know  what  to  do.   Talisa  and
    Saphire are both in the education system.  This country is their  home.
    Jamaica is alien to them.

15. Having been here for over fifteen years she has built up a  significant
    private and family life.  They could not have  family  life  elsewhere.
    They have never been to Nigeria  which  is  her  husband's  country  of
    origin.  He has only been briefly to Jamaica in 2003 for the wedding.

16. She has known her husband since 2001.  At that time he was married  but
    his wife died  in  2002.   She  comforted  him  on  his  loss  and  the
    relationship developed.  They wanted to get married and the advice  was
    she should return to  Jamaica  and  then  seek  entry  clearance.   The
    application was refused because the ECO was not satisfied that they had
    entered into a genuine marriage.

17. Despite this she could not stay on in Jamaica and returned  to  the  UK
    using someone else's passport.   In  2008  seeking  to  regularise  her
    status she sought ILR but before a decision was made she  was  sent  to
    prison for having and  using  false  documents.   The  application  was
    withdrawn.

18. During her imprisonment for around a year, her husband had a very  hard
    time trying to cope with the children.

19. As to the effect of her proposed deportation her evidence was that  her
    husband has been depressed because he would not be able  to  cope  with
    the children on his own.  He runs a minicab  business  which  takes  up
    most of his time.  The children are scared of going to Jamaica  because
    it is dangerous.  Nigeria is no better.

20. The Appellant's husband also gave evidence.   He  has  been  a  British
    citizen since 1996.  He confirmed his wife's evidence as to the  family
    situation.  If the Appellant and his step daughters were to be deported
    it would be devastating for the whole family.  The step daughters could
    not cope with being uprooted.  They have lived here from a  very  young
    age.  They have no knowledge of the country of their birth.   The  only
    place they know is here.

21. As for his own circumstances  he  confirmed  that  he  runs  a  minicab
    business which takes up most of his time.  When the  Appellant  was  in
    prison the business nearly went bankrupt because he depended so much on
    his wife to look after the children when he was at work.  The  business
    has still not recovered.  He owes �18,000 to HMRC.  Without his wife he
    would have to give up the  business  but  many  people  depend  on  him
    financially including his elderly parents in Nigeria.  If his wife  and
    step daughters were deported it  would  ruin  their  lives.   The  step
    daughters and his children by his wife are all very  close.  Akeem,  in
    particular depends on Talisa.  He could not afford to employ  a  helper
    nor would he wish to do so.

22. He could not relocate to Jamaica.  He has lived all his life in the  UK
    and has only visited there once, very briefly, for  the  wedding.   His
    step daughters have spent all their lives here.  If they and  his  wife
    went to Jamaica he would not be able to support them.  Nor  could  they
    go to Nigeria.  It is not safe and there is nothing there for them.

23. There was also evidence from Talisa.  She has no recollection  of  life
    in Jamaica.  Her education has been in the UK and she hopes  to  go  to
    university.  All her relatives and close friends are here.  She  has  a
    good relationship with her stepfather and looks up to  him  as  a  role
    model.  She also gets on well with her step brother, Akeem, who saw her
    as a mother figure when their mother was  in  prison.   She  could  not
    imagine living without her half sister, Kayshell. When her  mother  was
    in prison it had a huge impact on the family.

24. In his findings the judge found the three witnesses to be credible.  He
    went on to consider the relevant law in particular paragraphs 398,  399
    and 399A of the Immigration Rules.  He considered that the focus was on
    399(a) and that the Appellant has a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
    relationship with all of her children, three of whom are under the  age
    of 18 and in the UK.  Akeem and Kayshell are British citizens and  thus
    satisfied 399(a)(i) while Saphire, a Jamaican citizen, has lived in the
    UK continuously for over seven years and thus satisfied 399(a)(ii).

25. The judge went on to consider whether it would be reasonable to  expect
    the children to leave the UK and whether any  other  family  member  is
    able to care for them in the UK.  He found (at [37] and [38])  that  it
    would not be reasonable to expect the children to leave.  At [39] ff he
    found that there would be no other family member able to care for them.
     Concluding that 339(a) was satisfied he allowed the appeals.

26. The judge then went on to consider Article 8 ECHR.  Having advanced  to
    proportionality he noted the public  interest  in  the  deportation  of
    foreign criminals and went on to consider s117 public interest factors.
     He considered that s117C Exception 2 applied (genuine  and  subsisting
    relationship  with  a  qualifying  partner/child  and  the  effect   of
    deportation on the partner/child would be unduly harsh).  He also found
    that it would be in the best interests of the British born children  to
    live in the UK with both parents as part of a family unit.  He  allowed
    the appeals, additionally, under Article 8.

27. The Secretary of State sought permission to appeal which was granted by
    a judge on 22 October 2014.

28. At the error of law hearing on 10 December 2014 the Panel (Carr  J  and
    Upper Tribunal Judge Conway) concluded that while much of  the  grounds
    amounted to no more than disagreement  with  the  findings,  the  first
    ground had merit.  That ground was that the Tribunal  had  referred  to
    the  incorrect  rule.   The  test  applied,  namely,  whether  it   was
    reasonable for the children to leave the UK and whether another  family
    member can care for them had been changed from 28 July 2014 to the test
    of whether it would be unduly harsh  on  her  children  or  husband  to
    relocate or remain without her.  Whilst the Tribunal  later  found  (at
    [51(5)]) in its consideration under Article 8 ECHR  that  it  would  be
    unduly harsh on her husband and children, it  was  clear  from  [36-41]
    that this was not the consideration the Tribunal  were  assessing  when
    making those findings under the rules.

29. Mr Oke, who appeared on that date for the Appellants  agreed  that  the
    Tribunal had  considered the wrong rules and that such was  a  material
    error.  By consent the determination was set aside to be remade.

30. At the resumed hearing date before me there was no oral  evidence  only
    submissions.

31. Mr Kandola did not seek to make any challenge to the credibility of the
    witnesses.

32. His first submission was that the Appellant's criminal history  was  an
    escalating one.  The public interest in her removal was a pressing one.

33. Turning to paragraph 399, Mr Kandola submitted that (b) did  not  apply
    as the Appellant's relationship with her partner  had  been  precarious
    when their relationship was formed.

34. He accepted 399(a) was potentially applicable.  There was a genuine and
    subsisting  parental  relationship.   However,  Mr  Kandola  questioned
    whether it was necessarily in the children's  best  interests  to  stay
    with their mother.  In that regard the  offending  by  Talisa  who  was
    reprimanded by police in 2012 for shoplifting was noted.  Such did  not
    suggest the good influence of her mother.

35. Mr Kandola next questioned whether it would be  unduly  harsh  for  the
    children to go to Jamaica.  Many  people  take  their  children  abroad
    legitimately.  The Appellant is to blame for  not  thinking  that  such
    might be a consequence of her  criminality.   If  it  is  in  the  best
    interests of the younger children to be with their  mother  they  could
    adapt to life in Jamaica.  Whilst Saphire has been in the UK  for  most
    of her life she is approaching adulthood and would have the maturity to
    adapt with her mother and her stepfather if he chose to go.

36. Mr Kandola submitted that an option was for the  UK  born  children  to
    remain in the UK with their father.  He is well able to look after them
    as he was when their mother was in prison.  It  was  not  determinative
    that he might have to give up work to care for them.  They  are  young.
    Any effects are not likely to be so adverse.   There  was  no  evidence
    that they would lose contact with their mother.

37. Mr Kandola ended by submitting that the  rules  are  a  complete  code.
    There was no need for separate enquiry outside the rules.   He  invited
    me to dismiss the appeals.

38. In reply Mr Layne submitted that the crux is paragraph 399(a).   Whilst
    Talisa is over 18, the other three children are under 18  and  the  two
    youngest are British.  Saphire has been in the UK for most of her  life
    and indeed has, effectively, never been to Jamaica.  The  children  are
    innocent parties.  Through no fault of their own the  British  children
    could find themselves split up from their mother.  If she was  deported
    and they remained in the UK they would be likely  to  lose  their  bond
    with her.  The consequences would be unduly harsh.

39. Mr Layne submitted that the husband/father also had  an  interest.   He
    was previously married but lost his first wife to sickle cell  anaemia.
    To lose his second wife to deportation would be a severe  blow  to  him
    particularly as she  would  face  ten  years  exclusion.   He  has  his
    business.  It would be difficult to run that and  care  for  their  two
    younger children.  His business almost failed  when  his  wife  was  in
    prison.  He would have no help from UK relatives.

40. Mr Layne submitted that the best interests of the children must be that
    all remain in the UK with both parents, the family intact.

41. Mr Layne  considered  the  public  interest.   The  Appellant  had  not
    offended since her release.   She  is  a  reformed  character  who  had
    learned a painful lesson.

42. Mr  Layne  submitted  that  the  public  interest  in  deportation  was
    outweighed in the particular circumstances of this case.  He  asked  me
    to allow the appeal.

43. In considering this matter I note first the relevant law:

         'A398.   These rules apply where:

                (a)    a foreign criminal liable to deportation claims  that
                    his  deportation  would  be  contrary  to   the   United
                    Kingdom's obligations  under  Article  8  of  the  Human
                    Rights Convention ...

         398. Where a person claims that their deportation would be contrary
                to the UK's obligations under Article 8 of the Human  Rights
                Convention, and

                ...

                (b)     the  deportation  of  the  person  from  the  UK  is
                    conducive to the public good and in the public  interest
                    because they have been convicted of an offence for which
                    they have been sentenced to a period of imprisonment  of
                    less than 4 years but at least 12 months;

                ...

                the Secretary of State in assessing that claim will consider
                whether paragraph 399 or 399A applies and, if it  does  not,
                the public interest in deportation will only  be  outweighed
                by  other  factors   where   there   are   very   compelling
                circumstances over and above those described  in  paragraphs
                399 and 399A.

         399. This paragraph applies where paragraph 398(b) or  (c)  applies
                if -

                (a)    the person has  a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
                    relationship with a child under the age of 18 who is  in
                    the UK, and

                    (i)    the child is a British Citizen;

                    (ii)   the child has lived in the UK continuously for at
                        least the 7 years immediately preceding the date of
                        the immigration decision; and in either case

                        (a)    it would be unduly harsh for  the  child  to
                             live in the country to which the person  is  to
                             be deported; and

                        (b)    it would be unduly harsh for  the  child  to
                             remain in the UK without the person who  is  to
                             be deported; or

                (b)    the person has a genuine and subsisting  relationship
                    with a partner who is in the UK and is a British Citizen
                    or settled in the UK, and

                    (i)    the relationship was formed at a  time  when  the
                        person (deportee) was in the UK lawfully and  their
                        immigration status was not precarious; and

                    (ii)   it would be unduly harsh for that partner to live
                        in the  country  to  which  the  person  is  to  be
                        deported, because of compelling circumstances  over
                        and above those  described  in  paragraph  EX.2  of
                        Appendix FM; and

                    (iii)  it would be unduly  harsh  for  that  partner  to
                        remain in the UK without that person who is  to  be
                        deported.

         399A.    This paragraph  applies  where  paragraph  398(b)  or  (c)
                applies if -

                (a)    the person has been lawfully resident in the  UK  for
                    most of his life; and

                (b)    he is socially and culturally integrated in  the  UK;
                    and

                (c)    there would be  very  significant  obstacles  to  his
                    integration into the country to which it is proposed  he
                    is deported.'

44. In considering this matter it is noted that deportation is conducive to
    the public  good  because  she  has  been  sentenced  to  a  period  of
    imprisonment of two years. I begin by seeking to identify issues in the
    public interest.  In deportation appeals the public interest  is  often
    much stronger than in other types of  immigration  appeals  relying  on
    private and family rights.  The public interest not only refers to  any
    risks the individual might pose  but  also  to  the  fact  that  it  is
    necessary to have a consistent policy  of  expelling  foreign  national
    criminals in order to deter others.  The more serious the  offence  the
    greater weight to be attached to the Respondent's decision.

45. In that regard I note the  decision  in  Masih  (deportation  -  public
    interest - basic principles) Pakistan [2012] UKUT  to  which  reference
    was made in the grounds seeking permission.  The Tribunal stated: 'In a
    case of automatic deportation full account must be taken of the  strong
    public interest in  removing  foreign  citizens  convicted  of  serious
    offences, which lies not only in the prevention of further offences  on
    the part of the individual concerned,  but  in  deterring  others  from
    committing them in the first place ... Deportation of foreign criminals
    exposes  society's  condemnation  of  serious  criminal  activity   and
    promotes public confidence in the treatment  of  foreign  citizens  who
    have committed them.'

46. In the Appellant's case I note first her criminal history.  There  are,
    as indicated,  convictions in 2000, 2006, 2008  and  2010  relating  to
    theft by shoplifting/handling stolen goods for which the sentences were
     fines/conditional  discharge.   The  major  offence  resulted  in  the
    conviction on 17 February 2010 for deception involving the obtaining of
    two British passports and other identity documents in false names which
    she used to obtain immigration  status.   She  also  committed  benefit
    fraud.  The sentence was a total of two years' imprisonment.

47. The sentencing judge's remarks note that while she arrived  in  the  UK
    lawfully she had 'absolutely no right to remain in this  country  after
    the expiry of (her) student visa on 31 March 2001'.   The  judge  noted
    that 'The claiming in  particular  of  passports  and  two  provisional
    driving licences  to  which  (she  was)  not  entitled'  was  something
    regarded 'very seriously by the courts'.

48. The judge took into account in her favour that she had three  children,
    had been 'very frank in pleading guilty at the  first  opportunity  and
    that (she) honestly accepted (her) guilt in interview'.

49. I note that since her release she has not reoffended.   Further,  there
    is no suggestion that she is at risk of reoffending or at risk of  harm
    to the public.

50. I next turn to consider the facts in the context of the  law  which  is
    set out above, namely paragraphs 398 - 399 of the Rules.

51. The claim is that deportation would be contrary to the UK's obligations
    under Article 8.

52. There is no dispute that there is family life  between  the  Appellant,
    her husband and the three children. Although  Talisa  is  now  a  young
    adult it is accepted she remains part of the family unit.

53. I require to consider whether paragraph 399 or 399A applies.  Paragraph
    399(b) does not apply not least because although the  Appellant  has  a
    genuine and subsisting relationship with a partner who is in the UK and
    is a British citizen the relationship was not formed at a time when she
    was in the UK lawfully.  Paragraph 399A also does not apply as she  has
    not been lawfully resident for most of her life here.

54. Turning to consider 399(a) there is no dispute that she has  a  genuine
    and subsisting parental relationship with her children  who  are  under
    the age of 18 and are in the UK.  They are Saphire, Kayshell and Akeem.
     Saphire is a citizen of Jamaica but has lived in the  UK  continuously
    for at least the seven years immediately  preceding  the  date  of  the
    immigration decision (399(a)(ii)).   Kayshell  and  Akeem  are  British
    citizens.

55. The issues are whether it would be unduly harsh for them to live in the
    country to which the Appellant is to be deported or whether it would be
    unduly harsh for them to remain in the UK without  her.  I  give  these
    words their ordinary meaning, thus, 'unduly' defined  as  'excessively'
    and 'harsh' as 'severe, cruel' (such also being  the  position  in  the
    Respondent's IDI at 2.5.2).

56. I need to consider the best  interests  of  the  minor  children.   The
    situation is complicated because two are British  citizens,  Akeem  and
    Kayshell, whilst the third, Saphire  is  a  Jamaican  citizen.  Talisa,
    although now nineteen is still part of the family unit.

57. The presence of children, even when they are British has been held  not
    to preclude deportation action  automatically.  The  interests  of  the
    children particularly with regard to nationality, whilst very important
    are not a trump card over all other policy considerations which include
    the need to maintain firm and fair immigration control.

58. I note from the refusal letter that it was conceded that it  would  not
    be reasonable to expect Akeem to leave with  his  mother  but  that  he
    could continue to live with his father who was his primary carer  while
    his mother was in prison.  Since then his younger sister  Kayshell  has
    been born.

59. Mr Kandola's submission on paragraph 399 (a) (ii) (a) in the  situation
    where the Appellant returned to Jamaica without her  husband  but  with
    the children appeared essentially to be limited to the suggestion  that
    the British children could  adapt  to  life  in  Jamaica.  I  disagree.
    Neither child has ever been to Jamaica.  Whilst  Kayshell  is  a  baby,
    Akeem is nine years old and knows of no other life. It is not  disputed
    that the Appellant, who has herself been absent from Jamaica  for  some
    15 years has no family there. She left at least in part because of gang
    problems, violence and abuse she suffered in inner  city  Kingston.  As
    well as no local support, she has limited financial resources,  limited
    skills, education  or  training  that  she  could  utilise,  so  it  is
    difficult to see how she would be able to support them. On the facts of
    this case I conclude that it would be  unduly  harsh  for  the  British
    children to live in Jamaica with their mother alone.

60. The situation for Talisa and Saphire is different to  the  extent  that
    they are Jamaican citizens. They are also older. However, they too have
    spent, effectively, their entire lives in the UK having arrived here in
    1999 when Talisa was 4 or 5 and Saphire only a few  months  old.   They
    had no choice. Talisa only became aware of the illegal status  recently
    as she said in her January 2014 statement. They are innocent players in
    this matter. They have never been back to Jamaica.  They have developed
    considerable ties beyond those of their family and  know  of  no  other
    life other than in  this  country.  Talisa  is  completing  her  school
    education and hopes to go on to university. The same issues of lack  of
    support and resources on return apply. I again do not see there  to  be
    merit in the suggestion that they could adapt to life there. Further, I
    do not see that it is in the best interests of the  children  that  the
    siblings be split up. It is not disputed that they are  all  close  and
    that particularly when their mother was in  prison  Talisa  effectively
    took over the mother role for Akeem. As indeed, Mr Talabi  has  been  a
    father figure to Talisa and Saphire.

61. The crux of Mr Kandola's submission was that it was  feasible  for  the
    whole family including the  Appellant's  husband  to  go  and  live  in
    Jamaica, which failing, the British children could  remain  in  the  UK
    with him but without their mother. Mr Kandola did not press  that  they
    could all go to Nigeria.

62.  I find this to be a finely balanced  issue.  Mr  Talabi  took  up  his
    relationship with the Appellant and had children  by  her  despite  his
    knowing her status. However, he is a British citizen who apart from the
    brief marriage visit has never been  to  Jamaica.  A  more  significant
    issue is how he  would  be  able  to  support  his  family  in  Jamaica
    particular the three minor children. As  indicated  the  Appellant  has
    limited skills that she would be able to provide. The sole, legitimate,
    earner during her married life has been Mr Talabi.  He too has  limited
    skills and resources.  His taxi business is struggling and  he  owes  a
    substantial payment to HMRC.  He  has  financial  responsibilities  for
    adult children by his first, deceased, wife and  his  elderly  parents.
    The Appellant cannot succeed on the basis of her relationship with  her
    husband Mr Talabi under paragraph 399(b). However, on the facts  looked
    at cumulatively for the reasons given above I find that it would not be
    in the best interests of the children to relocate as a complete  family
    unit to Jamaica.

63. It was submitted that it would not be  unduly  harsh  for  the  British
    children to remain without their mother in the  UK.   I  note  in  that
    regard AD Lee v SSHD [2011] EWCA Civ  348  when  Sedley  LJ  said  'the
    tragic consequences is that this family ... would be broken up  forever
    because of the Appellant's bad behaviour.   That  is  what  deportation
    does'.

64. As indicated the British children are both young. Akeem, age  9  is  in
    his formative years. Kayshell is  a  baby.  It  is,  in  my  judgement,
    indisputable that they, particularly the baby Kayshell, are of  an  age
    when they need their mother, their primary carer. I do not  find  merit
    in the submission that it might be in the children's best interests  to
    be separated from the Appellant because her criminal history might be a
    bad influence on them.  There  is  no  evidence  that  Akeem  has  been
    adversely affected by his mother's criminality. Whilst it  is  recorded
    that Talisa was reprimanded by police for shoplifting in 2012 it  seems
    to me to be speculative to blame that on their  mother's  influence.  I
    see no indication that the Appellant when she was on her own, and later
    with Mr Talabi, has been anything other than a caring mother.

65. I find it also to be of relevance that Mr Talabi struggled to care  for
    the three children during the period of  his  wife's  imprisonment.  It
    helped that he knew the  separation  was  temporary.  Nonetheless,  the
    effect was such that his business nearly folded.  I  accept  the  claim
    that were he to be again in that position such  difficulties  would  be
    likely to recur with the consequent effects on the  children.  As  this
    time separation would almost certainly be for  much  longer,  it  seems
    reasonable to conclude that Mr Talabi would face real difficulties, not
    just financial, in providing the children (which include a  baby)  with
    the level of care that they would require.

66. The Appellant is likely to face exclusion for up to ten years.   I  see
    no reason why the British children were they  to  remain  without  her,
    would not be able to keep in touch with their mother by  telephone  and
    the internet.  However  in  view  of  the  family's  limited  financial
    circumstances it seems unlikely that there would be the possibility  of
    visits to her.  I conclude that such cannot be to the  benefit  of,  in
    particular, young children. There must be a significant risk that their
    bond with her and their half sisters would be broken which cannot be in
    their best interests.

67. In submissions I was urged to consider Mr Talabi's situation as well as
    that of the children.  I find some merit in  the  submission  that  the
    effects on Mr Talabi of his wife's  deportation  would  be  severe  not
    least because he would effectively be facing  a  loss  for  the  second
    time, having been previously widowed.

68. It is difficult to have much, if any sympathy for  the  Appellant.  Her
    criminality in using false documents was deplorable as was her complete
    disregard for the laws of this country by remaining here  for  so  long
    unlawfully. Also, that she entered the relationship with Mr Talabi  and
    started a family by him despite her status. Whilst it is difficult  not
    to have some sympathy for Mr  Talabi  in  seeking  a  new  relationship
    following the death of his first wife, he too entered the  relationship
    with the Appellant knowing her status.

69. I note the Appellant's rehabilitation. However, I bear in mind in  that
    regard that the protection of the public from harm  by  way  of  future
    offending is only one of the factors that makes  it  conducive  to  the
    public good to deport criminals. Other factors, as  indicated,  include
    the need to mark the public's revulsion at the offender's  conduct  and
    the need to deter others from acting in a similar  way.   However,  the
    crux in  this  case,  as  the  rules  indicate,  is  the  children,  in
    particular the three minors. In the particular  circumstances  of  this
    case for the reasons given I conclude that it would be unduly harsh for
    the children to remain in the UK without their mother and  to  live  in
    the country to which she is to be deported.

70. The deportation would be contrary to the UK's obligations under Article
    8.  The appeals succeed under the Immigration Rules.
