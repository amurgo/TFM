                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. For convenience I will refer to the parties as they were named in the
    First tier Tribunal.

 2. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State for the Home Department
    (hereinafter referred to as the respondent) against the decision of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Obhi who allowed the appeal under Appendix FM
    of the immigration rules and on article 8 grounds.

 3. The appellant is a national of Pakistan born on 24 April 1996. She made
    application on or about 3rd February 2015 to join her husband, Mr
    S.Ahmed, a British national, hereinafter referred to as the sponsor.
    They married in Pakistan on 4th April 2014.

 4. In order to meet the financial requirement in appendix FM her sponsor
    needed to demonstrate an income of �18,600 per annum.This had to be
    evidenced by the requirements of appendix FM-SE.

 5.  It was stated her sponsor was employed by Tesco Stores Ltd since 5
    September 2006 and by Holy Croft Aye Ltd since 22nd June 2014. Under
    the rules in respect of salaried employment a letter from the employer
    was required stating the person's employment and their gross annual
    salary; the length of their employment; the period over which they had
    been paid the salary relied upon and whether they were permanent; on a
    fixed term contract; or engaged through an agency.

 6. Her application was refused on 23rd April 2015.The entry clearance
    officer was not satisfied that the employment letters provided met the
    requirements. Furthermore, the bank statements provided did not show
    corresponding deposits with the payslips for 14 December 2014 and 28
    December 2014 in respect of the employment with this. An additional
    reason for the refusal related to suitability of the accommodation. On
    review by the entry clearance manager the decision was unchanged. In
    addition the entry clearance manager was not satisfied that family life
    existed and consequently article 8 did not apply or in the alternative,
    the decision was proportionate.

The First tier Tribunal

 7. At paragraph 17 of the decision Judge Obhi found that the letter from
    Tesco's did not state, as was required, the period over which the
    sponsor had been paid the salary he was on. The judge could not find
    the original letter from Holy Croft Aye Ltd but did have one which was
    before the entry clearance manager which stated what the appellant had
    earned since he started that employment. The letter explained why there
    were no corresponding payments into the sponsor's bank account for the
    two weeks in December 2014.

 8. At paragraph 19 the judge agreed with the submission on behalf of the
    appellant that the entry clearance manager had failed to engage with
    the information provided. At paragraph 19 the judge stated:

         "The only piece of information missing is a period of time over
         which the sponsor was paid the salary that he is currently on, by
         Tesco Stores Ltd. "

    The judge concluded the omission was not fatal as the amount was
    confirmed by other information, such as salary slips and payments into
    the bank account. Consequently, the appeal was allowed under the rules.
    In the decision section the judge allowed the appeal under human rights
    but gave no explanation.

The Upper Tribunal proceedings

 9. The respondent applied for permission to appeal on the basis the
    decision was not sustainable given that the specific requirements in
    appendix FM -SE were not met. The letter from Tesco's did not state how
    long he had been earning the salary stated and there were two payments
    from his other employment which were not in his bank statements. In the
    alternative it was said the judge had not identified compelling
    circumstances justifying allowing the appeal on freestanding article 8
    grounds.

10. Permission was granted on the basis that the judge arguably erred in
    law in allowing the appeal when the evidential requirements specified
    in appendix FM -SE were not met. Furthermore, the article 8 assessment
    was arguably insufficient.

11. The appellant's representatives lodged a rule 24 response. It was
    contended that the letter from Tesco met the requirements of the
    immigration rules. This was because the sponsor did not receive a fixed
    salary from Tesco's and so was not in salaried employment. Therefore,
    the requirement of paragraph 2(b)(iii) of an employer's letter stating
    the period over which the salary had been paid did not apply.

12. Regarding the two weeks pay not paid into the bank it was contended
    that if these amounts were disregarded the sponsor still had adequate
    income.

13. At hearing, Mr Clarke submitted that the sponsor was in salaried
    employment with Tesco and that the distinction the appellant's
    representative sought to make was false. Mr Z. Nazim submitted that the
    rules were met or in the alternative that the appeal could be allowed
    on article 8 grounds. Both parties agreed that if I found a material
    error of law then I was in a position to remake the decision.

Consideration

14. The covering letter of 3 February 2015 with the application contends
    that the sponsor is a non-salaried employment with Tesco. This is not
    repeated in the letter seeking a review of the decision. In the judge's
    decision there is no reference in the record of the submissions to this
    argument. Noteably, reference is to his salary.

15. Mr Nazim refers to a dictionary definition of salary as being:

         'A fixed regular payment, typically paid on a monthly basis but
         often expressed as an annual sum, made by an employer to an
         employee.'

16. The letter from Tesco's of 2 February 2015 refers to the appellant
    working 36.5 hours and that he earns �1256 per month before tax and
    there is sometimes the opportunity for overtime. The subsequent letter
    dated 11 May 2015 again refers to him working 36.5 hours per week and
    there is reference to a gross wage of �14,683 .36. There is a comment
    in brackets indicating this relates to the tax year 2014/2015 being his
    annual salary inclusive of overtime. If the figure in the first letter
    is multiplied by 12 this would give �15,072. The first letter states
    this is before overtime. As this figure is higher than the figure given
    for the tax year 2014/2015 it would suggest the reference to monthly
    earnings of �1256 is referring to the position at the time of writing
    rather than for the whole year. This one explanation is that at some
    stage he received the basic pay rise.

17. What I take from the correspondence is that the appellant is contracted
    to work 36.5 hours in order to achieve his basic annual salary which is
    payable monthly. Within the year there is the opportunity of overtime
    payable at an hourly rate. This indicates he is in salaried employment.

18. Judge Obhi at paragraph 19 acknowledges that the letters from Tesco do
    not show the period of time over which he was paid the salary he is
    currently on. It follows from this that the requirements of paragraph
    2(b) of Appendix FM-SE have not been met. Judge Obhi went on to say
    that this was not fatal as the salary slips and payments into his bank
    account could remedy this.

19. The decision of Chau Le (immigration rules-de minimis principal)
    [2016]UKUT 00186 concerned a student seeking further leave to remain
    who was refused on the basis the maintenance requirements were not met.
    The student was required to have a minimum credit balance of �2,040 for
    28 days. In the period there were shortfalls varying from �11.68 to �1.
    69. The First-tier tribunal had allowed the appeal on the basis that
    the non-compliance was so minimal that the rules could be considered to
    have been complied with. The Presidential led Upper Tribunal indicated
    the first task of the Tribunal was to construe the rule in question and
    whether or not it was complied with. The decision stated:

         "15...In our judgement this is a black-and-white question. Either
         the applicant satisfies a rule or he does not. No intermediate, or
         third, possibility exists. The prevalence of "bright line"
         provisions in the immigration rules has been repeatedly considered
         lawful as to promote consistency, certainty and equality of
         treatment amongst immigrants.

         16. Furthermore, we have difficulty in distinguishing both
         conceptually and logically between a minor, or minimal, failure to
         satisfy a rule (the discredited" near miss" principle) and the
         operation of the de minimus principle..."



Error of Law

20. It was a material error of law for the judge, having accepted that the
    required proof was not available, to then allow the appeal under the
    immigration rules. The allowance of the appeal on human rights grounds
    is unsustainable. No reasons have been given by the judge for doing so.



Remaking the decision

21. The rules cannot be met because the letter from Tesco does not provide
    the specified information. It follows that the argument that the
    financial requirements are met if the contentious two weeks pay from
    Holy Croft Aye Ltd is omitted falls away.

22. In terms of article 8 appendix FM and the associated FM SE are meant to
    be article 8 compliant. They provide a means whereby a spouse can
    obtain entry clearance provided the rules are met. Before undertaking a
    freestanding article 8 assessment there must be something about the
    situation which is not covered by the rules and cries out for such an
    assessment. Article 8 is not meant to be used for patching up
    deficiencies in the application under the rules. In the present
    situation I cannot see anything which is not adequately covered by the
    rules. The rules state what must be met and it is up to applicant's to
    ensure compliance. This has not been done. However it remains open to
    the applicant to make a properly proofed further application. The
    financial requirements have been approved by the Court of Appeal and
    section 117 B (3) of the 2002 Act emphasises in a statutory form the
    need for financial stability. I can see nothing about the respondent's
    decision which is disproportionate.



Decision

The decision of First-tier Judge Obhi materially errs in law and cannot
stand. I remake the decision dismissing the appeal under the rules. I find
no breach of the appellant's protected rights.
