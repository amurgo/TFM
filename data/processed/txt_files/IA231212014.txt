                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Andrew, promulgated on 8th September 2014, following a hearing at
    Birmingham Sheldon Court on 7th August 2014.  In the determination, the
    judge  allowed  the  appeal  of  Mr  Hassam  Mushtaq.   The  Respondent
    Secretary  of  State  subsequently  applied  for,  and   was   granted,
    permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal, and thus the  matter  comes
    before me.



The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a male, a citizen of Pakistan, who was  born  on  30th
    June 1991.  He appealed against the decision of  the  Respondent  dated
    12th May 2014, to refuse to grant him further leave to remain in the UK
    as a Tier 4 (General) Student  under  paragraph  245ZX(d)  of  HC  395,
    because he had not been awarded 10 points for maintenance (funds).

The Appellant's Claim

 3. The Appellant's claim is properly set out  by  the  judge  below.   She
    recounted how the Appellant completed a computer-generated form to make
    his application for further leave.  He had to complete the  CAS  number
    and the form then generated the amounts which were required to be shown
    by him to comply with the Rules.  The form showed that he needed �1,424
    for his fees (which had been paid) and  �2,000  for  maintenance.   The
    judge observed how it was common ground that the Appellant  produced  a
    bank statement showing that he had in excess of this sum (see paragraph
    5).

The Judge's Findings

 4. At the hearing before the judge  on  7th  August  2014,  the  Appellant
    appeared in person, as he had done  before  this  Tribunal  today,  and
    produced further evidence in the form of a letter from  BPP  University
    dated 21st May 2014, and this confirmed that contrary to the Respondent
    Secretary of State's view, the  Appellant  had  not  studied  for  four
    months in the last twelve months, but had  actually  studied  for  more
    than six months (see paragraph 7 of the determination).

 5. The judge considered this to be dispositive of the  appeal  before  her
    and found in favour of the Appellant, whereupon the Secretary of  State
    appealed to this Tribunal.

The Grounds of Appeal

 6. The grounds of appeal essentially make two  points.   First,  that  the
    First-tier Tribunal was not in a position to be  the  primary  decision
    maker in the circumstances that existed before her, and ought  to  have
    remitted the matter back to the Secretary of State  when,  contrary  to
    Section 85A of the 2002 Act, additional  material  in  the  form  of  a
    letter from BPP University dated 21st May 2014 (postdecision  evidence)
    was produced, showing the Appellant to have studied in the UK for  more
    than six months in the past twelve months.

 7. Second, the judge could have made a finding that the  decision  of  the
    Respondent was not in accordance with the law and only have allowed the
    appeal to the limited extent that it remained outstanding, and then  to
    await a fresh decision from the Secretary of State.  This was important
    so that the judge could consider the postdecision evidence.

 8. On 17th October 2014, permission to appeal was granted.

Submissions

 9. At the hearing before me on 23rd April 2015, the  Respondent  Secretary
    of State was  represented  by  Mr  Clarke,  a  Home  Office  Presenting
    Officer, and the Appellant appeared in person himself.  Mr Clarke, much
    to his credit in the appeal before me, made it clear at the outset that
    the evidence before the judge, even prior to the disclosure of the  BPP
    letter of 21st May 2014, did indicate that the  Appellant  had  studied
    for six months out of the last twelve.  The Appellant started  studying
    in 2012.  He then applied for an extension of  leave.   This  was  from
    August 2013 until May 2014 and it was granted.  The Appellant continued
    with his studies.

10. For his part, Mr Mushtaq, drew my attention to paragraph 14 of Appendix
    C.  This is clear in stating that,

         "An applicant will have an established presence studying in the  UK
         if the applicant has current entry clearance,  leave  to  enter  or
         leave to remain as a Tier 4 Migrant, student or as  a  postgraduate
         doctor or dentist and at the date of application:

         ...

         (ii) is applying for continued study on a single course  where  the
             applicant has completed at least six  months  of  that  course
             ...".

    Mr Mushtaq Hassam submitted that the  evidence  was  plain  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal that he  could  comply  with  paragraph  14(ii)  of
    Appendix C.

11. Mr Clarke was invited to reply further to the submissions and  declined
    to do so.

No Error of Law

12. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  did  not
    involve the making of an error on a point of law (see Section 12(1)  of
    TCEA 2007) such that I should set aside that decision.   On  any  view,
    the decision by the judge is clear, concise,  and  to  the  point.   It
    adequately deals  with  the  issues  raised.   The  evidence  from  the
    Appellant is set out (see paragraph 5) prior to  the  hearing  and  the
    evidence at the hearing is also presented.  The case for the Respondent
    was that the Appellant did not have  an  established  presence  in  the
    United Kingdom.  This was plainly untenable because the  CAS  submitted
    confirmed that he did, and by the date of the hearing before the  judge
    (which on any view appertained to the  time  of  the  decision  by  the
    judge) confirmed in the form of a BPP letter dated 21st May 2014,  that
    this was the case.

Notice of Decision

13. There is no material error of law in  the  original  judge's  decision.
    The determination shall stand.

14. No anonymity order is made.
