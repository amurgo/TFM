                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Cooper, promulgated on 23rd December 2014, following a hearing at
    Taylor House on 27th November 2014.  In the determination,  the  judge
    allowed  the  appeal  of  Mohammad  Yasin  Kotowaroo.   The  Respondent
    subsequently applied for, and was granted, permission to appeal to  the
    Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.

The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a male, a citizen of Mauritius, who was  born  on  6th
    October 1987.  He appeals against the decision of the Respondent  dated
    31st March 2014 to refuse to grant him leave to remain in the UK  as  a
    Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant and to remove him by  way  of  directions
    given under Section 47 of the IANA 2006.

The Appellant's Claim

 3. The Appellant's claim is that he  can  meet  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules with respect to the  required  level  of  funding  in
    order for him to qualify as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant because  he
    has been able to produce bank statements  showing  credit  balances  in
    excess of �50,000, which is the figure  required  by  the  Rules.   The
    Respondent has not believed that  the  Appellant  has  access  to  this
    amount and has questioned the "viability and credibility of the  source
    of the money".  The Respondent did not believe the Appellant's  account
    given at the interview that he had accumulated approximately �10,000 by
    way of savings, given his  salary  of  �1,485.02  per  month  from  his
    employers.   The  Barclays  Bank  statements  did  not  highlight   any
    transactions that had been made  into  the  account  from  overseas  as
    confirmation as to the source of the funds.  Therefore, in  his  Notice
    of Appeal, the Appellant confirmed that he had been able to save  money
    from his personal income and from financial support which he  had  been
    given by his parents.  The �40,000 had come from his parents.

The Judge's Determination

 4. At the hearing before the  judge  on  27th  November  2014,  there  was
    further evidence.  As the judge recounted,

         "He  has  now  produced  affidavits  from  his  parents  confirming
         transfers made by them, and letters from two individuals confirming
         that they have transferred money direct to the Appellant in lieu of
         repaying loans due from them to his  parents.   The  Appellant  has
         also  produced  associated  banking  documents.   Taking  all  this
         evidence together, I am satisfied on the balance  of  probabilities
         that the Appellant did indeed have the required  amount  of  funds,
         which were legitimately provided and which he was entitled  to  use
         to invest in his business" (paragraph 18).

 5. The next question that the judge considered  was  in  relation  to  the
    "viability and credibility of the Appellant's  business  plans".   Here
    the Respondent had referred to the service agreement with  Aronex,  but
    considered that it was not clear what his exact duties would  be  under
    the agreement.  In the interview, the Appellant had stated that he  had
    given  them  engineering   support,   construction,   design   in   the
    planning/layout and material choice.   However,  their  website  showed
    that they already employed an architect and design assistant, "who  had
    shown the relevant qualification and experience to carry  out  all  the
    above duties that you have mentioned  at  interview".   Accordingly,  a
    question mark was raised as to why they would want to pay an additional
    fee to a newly established company to undertake the  same  work.   (See
    paragraph 19).

 6. The judge observed that, "the Appellant has now produced a letter  from
    Aronex (AB18) which, among other things, confirms  that  the  Appellant
    did indeed have a contract with them in relation to the development  of
    a building called Penta House in Liverpool ...".  It also states  that,
    "although they did employ an architect and design assistant she was not
    a UK qualified architect, and her duties were entirely different to the
    services Meta had been providing ..." (paragraph 20).

 7. The judge also went on to hear the Appellant's oral evidence  where  he
    "explained that he had been drafted in to check that the  building  was
    feasible ..." (paragraph 21).  In the end, the judge was  of  the  view
    that he was "satisfied that this  was  a  genuine  contract  which  did
    involve the Appellant  working  for  a  third  party  company  and  was
    indicative of the ability of Meta to carry out such work in the  future
    ..." (paragraph 22).

 8. The appeal was allowed.

Grounds of Application

 9. The grounds of application state that the judge erred in law because he
    allowed evidence that was submitted after the date of  the  application
    contrary to Section 85A of the NIAA 2002.  This  was  contrary  to  the
    Upper Tribunal's determination  in  Ahmed  (PBS:  admissible  evidence)
    [2014] UKUT 00365.

10. On 12th February 2015, permission to appeal was granted.

Submissions

11. At the hearing before me on 23rd April 2015, Mr  Clarke,  appearing  on
    behalf of the Respondent Secretary of State,  relied  fundamentally  on
    Ahmed (PBS: admissible evidence) [2014] UKUT 00365 had  submitted  that
    the new Section 85A(4) makes it quite clear that subsequent evidence in
    relation  to  a  non-points  scoring  aspect  of  the  Rule  cannot  be
    legitimately admitted.  He submitted that there was little  doubt  that
    there was an error, but the question for this Tribunal was whether this
    was a material error.  At paragraph 18 of the determination, the  judge
    referred to how the Appellant "has now  produced  affidavits  from  his
    parents confirming transfers made by them".  However, this evidence was
    not available earlier.  Furthermore, the judge also  referred  to  how,
    "the Appellant has now produced a  letter  from  Aronex  (AB18)  which,
    among other things, confirms the Appellant did indeed have  a  contract
    ...".  These were new matters  and  relevant  because  page  3  of  the
    refusal  letter  disputed  the  sums  that  were  relied   upon.    The
    Appellant's  income  simply  was  not  sufficient  for  him   to   have
    accumulated these sums.  Had it not been for the  affidavits  from  the
    Appellant's parents and the letter from Aronex, on the  basis  of  what
    the judge had set out at paragraphs 16, 17, and 18, the Appellant could
    not have succeeded.  Therefore the error was a material one.

12. For his part, Mr Nasim relied upon the fact that at  the  time  of  his
    application  he  did  provide  all  the  documents  required   by   the
    Immigration Rules.  Thereafter, the Appellant  was  called  in  for  an
    interview because there was a question mark about  the  "viability  and
    credibility of the source of the money".  There were concerns about the
    genuineness of the application.  New matters were raised for the  first
    time  in  the  interview  and   the   interviewing   officer   required
    satisfaction in relation to these matters.  Given  that  the  Appellant
    then purported to provide such evidence, which was forthcoming within a
    reasonable period of time,  which  included  the  affidavits  from  the
    parents, and the letter from Aronex, the judge  was  entitled  to  take
    into account these matters, which were not  specifically  enshrined  in
    the Rules any longer.  The Appellant's interview  took  place  on  13th
    March 2014.  His application took place a month earlier on 5th February
    2014.  It was only at the interview that  these  matters  were  raised.
    There is a question mark about his having saved �10,000, and the source
    of the �40,000.  These matters were not earlier in issue as far as  the
    application was concerned.  For the purposes of  his  application,  all
    that the Appellant had to do was to furnish his bank statements showing
    that he had the adequate funds, and this was evidently plain  from  the
    bank statements themselves.  Finally, if one looks at the case of Ahmed
    itself, it is plain that there is a  discretion  on  the  Secretary  of
    State to take into account evidence even under Section 85A(3)  and  (4)
    which is subsequently produced.  This is set out at paragraph 4 of  the
    decision in Ahmed.  It relates to exception 2.  It allows the  Tribunal
    to consider evidence adduced by the  Appellant  provided  that  it  "is
    adduced in  connection  with  the  Secretary  of  State's  reliance  on
    discretion under Immigration Rules ..."  Furthermore,  pointed  out  Mr
    Nasim, if one looks at Ahmed itself, this was a case where it  is  made
    clear at the outset (at paragraph 2)  that,  "the  Secretary  of  State
    interviewed  the  applicants  and  was  prepared  to   accept   further
    documentation  in  April  2013  ...".   This  acceptance   of   further
    documentation, submitted Mr Nasim, was on the basis of  the  provisions
    in the  Immigration  Rules  themselves  because  these  allowed  for  a
    discretion in the manner that he had just described.

13. In reply, Mr Clarke submitted that what this is authority  for  is  the
    statement that  non-points-based  reasons  cannot  go  to  points-based
    findings of fact.

No Error of Law

14. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  did  not
    involve the making of an error of law such that is material  in  a  way
    that should lead to this decision being set aside (see Section 12(1) of
    TCEA 2007).  There is one reason for this.   Whilst  the  admission  of
    evidence in relation to produced affidavits and a  letter  from  Aronex
    may well have been tantamount to an error  as  this  evidence  was  not
    available earlier, because the relevant child here is with the  parent,
    in Ahmed [2014] UKUT 00365, the Tribunal stated that Section 85A(4)  of
    the 2002 Act "applies to the non-points scoring aspect of the Rule: the
    prohibition is in relation to new evidence that goes to the scoring  of
    points".  In this case, the new evidence is not such that goes  to  the
    scoring of points.  What goes to the scoring of  points  was  the  pre-
    existing evidence that was before the Respondent  Secretary  of  State,
    namely, the production by the Appellant of bank statements that  showed
    credit balances in excess  of  �50,000.   Accordingly,  the  judge  was
    entitled to consider this evidence in the manner that he did.

Notice of Decision

15. There is no material error of law in  the  original  judge's  decision.
    The determination shall stand.

16. No anonymity order is made.
