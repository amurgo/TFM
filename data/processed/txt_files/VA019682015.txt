Representation
For the Appellant:     Mr S Staunton, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Miss M Benitez, counsel, instructed by Kilic & Kilic
Solicitors

                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. I shall refer to the appellant as the entry clearance officer  and  to
      the respondent as the claimant.


   2. The claimant is a national of Ghana. Her appeal before the  First-tier
      Tribunal against the decision of the entry clearance officer dated  22
      February 2015 refusing her application for an entry clearance  to  the
      UK as a visitor, was allowed by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Bird  in  a
      decision promulgated on 19 May 2016.


   3. The entry clearance officer appeals with permission, granted by First-
      tier Tribunal Judge Pooler. He found it to be  arguable  that  in  her
      consideration of Article 8 outside the Immigration  Rules,  the  Judge
      failed to address 'the proposition' that Article 8 does not extend  to
      the right to choose where family life  is  to  be  enjoyed;  that  she
      failed to find any reason why a family visit could not be made by  the
      claimant's sponsor, and wife to Ghana, and that she failed to identify
      any compelling circumstances.


   4. Mr Staunton relied on the grounds of appeal. Having found family life,
      the  Judge  failed  to  undertake  a  reasoned  "five  stage  (Razgar)
      consideration". The Judge at [29] found that there is an  interference
      in the family life nad that "....it is not unreasonable to expect  the
      [claimant] to want to visit them in this country." He  submitted  that
      Article 8 does not extend to the right to choose where family life  is
      to be enjoyed. No reasons were advanced as to why family life may  not
      be enjoyed by the sponsor and his wife visiting the claimant in Ghana.




   5. Moreover there is no  reason  why  the  visit  could  not  take  place
      elsewhere, nor are there any compelling  circumstances  -  SSHD  v  SS
      (Congo) & Others [2015] EWCA Civ 387 at [39].


   6. On behalf of the claimant, Ms  Benitez,  who  did  not  represent  her
      before  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  referred  to  the  fact  that  the
      claimant, as well as her sister, are  both  the  sponsor's  daughters;
      each applied for an entry clearance visa to visit their  father.  Both
      applications were made at the same time.


   7. She referred to [20] of Judge Bird's decision where she noted that the
      claimant produced evidence of her birth certificate naming the sponsor
      as her father. It was not disputed that the claimant applied with  her
      sister, naming the same sponsor and producing the same details. It was
      accepted in the case of the sister that the sponsor is her father  and
      was also the case when the claimant applied on the last two occasions.
      It is however only now that the relationship in  the  claimant's  case
      was disputed.


   8. Judge Bird found on the balance of probabilities that the claimant  is
      the daughter of the sponsor [21]. The entry clearance officer gave  no
      reason to explain why it had not been accepted that she was related to
      the sponsor as claimed. She stated that this bare  statement  did  not
      acknowledge that the claimant applied on three occasions with the same
      documents and the same sponsor. She applied  on  all  three  occasions
      with her sister.  The  sister's  documents  and  relationship  to  her
      sponsor had been accepted but the claimant's has not [21].


   9. She also accepted the claimant's evidence that  she  is  a  full  time
      student. There was nothing in the documents showing that she  intended
      making anything other than a  visit.  She  provided  evidence  of  her
      incentive to return. If  she  intended  to  come  to  settle  she  had
      legitimate grounds to do so.


  10. There has never been an attempt to come  to  settle.  Her  sister  has
      visited on three occasions and returned [24].


  11. The other ground on which the  entry  clearance  officer  refused  her
      application  related  to  whether  she  would  be   accommodated   and
      maintained in the UK without there being a recourse to  public  funds.
      The sponsor provided his employment letter as well as bank  statements
      of six months. He works for Asda, earning �1,100 a month.


  12. Judge Bird heard evidence from his wife confirming  that  she  too  is
      working. There was evidence of savings of nearly �16,000 in his wife's
      savings account. Even without the  wife's  savings,  the  sponsor  was
      gainfully employed, had some savings and was in a position to maintain
      the claimant for the duration of her stay. There is also  evidence  of
      the two bedroomed maisonette that the sponsor and his wife occupy. She
      found that there would  have  been  adequate  accommodation  available
      [25].


  13. She was therefore satisfied that the requirements of paragraph  41  of
      the Rules had been met.


  14. Ms Benitez submitted that the Judge then properly directed herself  at
      [26] onwards. She recognised that the claimant's application was  that
      the refusal decision breached her rights under Article 8 of the  Human
      Rights Convention.  The  fact  that  she  meets  the  requirements  of
      paragraph 41 is a factor to be put in the balance as to whether or not
      the decision is proportionate.


  15. Although the claimant may not be a minor, she certainly has dependency
      on her father and therefore  there  are,  because  of  the  continuing
      dependency on him, exceptional reasons which  show  that  there  is  a
      family life between the  claimant  and  her  father  [26].  The  entry
      clearance officer has not disputed  that  finding  in  the  permission
      application.


  16. Judge Bird considered that the claimant's sister had been  allowed  to
      come to the UK as a  family  visitor  on  three  occasions  while  the
      claimant has been refused. It is not unreasonable in the circumstances
      for the claimant to have the desire to visit the UK where  her  father
      lives and where he has made his home, and to come to see  him  as  and
      the circumstances he lives in - [26].


  17. The Judge directed herself in accordance with Mostafa (Article 8 entry
      clearance) [2015] UKUT 112 (IAC) - [26-28].


  18. At [29] she found that it was natural in  the  circumstances  for  the
      claimant to want to see at least where he  lives.  Whilst  it  can  be
      argued that family life can be continued with the sponsor and his wife
      visiting the claimant in Ghana, it is not unreasonable to  expect  the
      claimant to want to visit him in the UK where they live and have  made
      their home.


  19. In the circumstances she accordingly  found  that  there  will  be  no
      breach of the immigration  rules  as  she  meets  the  requirement  of
      paragraph 41 and the particular circumstances are such that the public
      interest does not require  that  she  be  excluded.  Accordingly,  the
      decision   in   these    particular    circumstances    '......is    a
      disproportionate interference to the claimant's rights  under  Article
      8' - [29 and 30].


  20. Mr Staunton said that he had nothing further to add in reply.


      Assessment


  21. Judge Bird stated at the outset of her assessment  that  the  claimant
      had a limited  right  of  appeal,  namely,  whether  the  refusal  was
      unlawful under section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998.


  22. Her finding that there is family life between  the  claimant  and  her
      father arising from her dependency on her father and stepmother  which
      is beyond the usual emotional ties, has not been placed in issue.


  23. The entry clearance officer contends that  having  found  family  life
      exists in the circumstances, the Judge failed to undertake a  reasoned
      five step Razgar approach.


  24. The Judge has however given detailed consideration as  to  whether  or
      not the decision is proportionate for the purposes of Article  8.  She
      was alive to the fact that Article 8 imposes no general obligation  on
      states to facilitate the choice made by a married couple to reside  in
      it. She found that the requirements under paragraph 41  of  the  Rules
      had been met. That was a factor in the proportionality exercise.


  25. She has properly directed herself in accordance with the  approach  in
      Mostafa, supra, referring to [23-24] of that decision.


  26. She set out her findings as  to  why  there  are  exceptional  reasons
      supporting the existence of family life between between  the  claimant
      and her father. Her mother died in 1992. There is no other parent  and
      accordingly the emotional dependency would be greater. Based on  those
      findings (which have not been challenged)  the  Judge  concluded  that
      whilst it could be argued that family life can be continued  with  the
      sponsor and his wife visiting the claimant in Ghana, it would  not  be
      unreasonable in the circumstances for the claimant to visit her father
      in the country where he lives to see  him  and  the  circumstances  he
      lives in.


  27. Those findings are sustainable on the evidence produced.


  28. In the circumstances, I find that the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  has
      not made any material error and has provided sustainable  reasons  for
      concluding that the entry clearance officer's decision  constituted  a
      disproportionate interference with the claimant's rights under Article
      8.


      Notice of Decision


      The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making  of
      an error on a point of law. It shall accordingly stand.
