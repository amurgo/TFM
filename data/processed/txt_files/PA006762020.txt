Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms. N Nnamani, Counsel, instructed by Howe & Co
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr. T Lindsay, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. The appellant appeals against a decision of the respondent to refuse to
    grant him leave to remain in this country as a recognised  refugee,  or
    alternatively on human rights grounds.  The  respondent's  decision  is
    dated 17 January 2020.

 2. The First-tier Tribunal (JFtT Kudhail) dismissed the appellant's appeal
    by a decision dated 24 March 2020. UTJ Gleeson  granted  the  appellant
    permission to appeal to this Tribunal by a decision sent to the parties
    on 5 August 2020. By a decision dated 22 February 2021  I  allowed  the
    appeal to the extent that the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  was
    set aside, and the decision would be remade by this Tribunal.

 3. At [22] of my decision I confirmed that the record of  the  appellant's
    evidence  detailed  at  [17]-[21]  of  Judge  Kudhail's  decision   was
    preserved. Ms. Nnamani confirmed at the hearing  that  the  record  was
    accurate and could properly be preserved.

 4. Though not recited in full in this decision, I confirm that I have read
    the evidence presented by the appellant to Judge Kudhail with care,  as
    I have when considering all of the evidence before me.

Anonymity

 5. An anonymity order was previously granted in this matter and no request
    was made by either party for such order to be set aside. I confirm  the
    order at the conclusion of this decision. I do so as it is presently in
    the interests of justice that the appellant is not publicly  recognised
    as someone seeking international  protection:  paragraph  13  of  Upper
    Tribunal Immigration and  Asylum  Chamber  Guidance  Note  2013  No  1:
    Anonymity Orders.

Background

 6. The appellant is a Turkish national and presently aged  35.  He  is  an
    ethnic Kurd. He secured entry clearance as a Tier 4  (General)  Student
    and entered this country in March 2010.  He  subsequently  applied  for
    further  leave  to  remain  as  a  businessman  under   the   EU-Turkey
    Association Agreement. The respondent  refused  the  application  by  a
    decision dated 22 February 2011, observing that  the  appellant  relied
    upon a letter from Mr. Dave Charlton in support of his application, but
    Mr. Charlton had confirmed to the respondent that that he was  not  the
    author of the letter.  The  application  was  therefore  refused  under
    paragraphs 245L and 322(1A) of the Immigration Rules.

 7. The appellant appealed the  respondent's  decision  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, and in so doing  requested  that  the  appeal  be  determined
    without   an   oral   hearing:   (IA/09358/2011).   His   then    legal
    representatives filed relevant  documentary  evidence  and  a  skeleton
    argument on his behalf.

 8. The First-tier Tribunal dismissed the appeal by  a  decision  dated  26
    April 2011. JFtT Myers observed, at �7 of her decision:

         '7. ... The Respondent contacted Mr. Charlton by telephone  to  ask
            him if he had written the letter and whether he intended to  use
            the  Appellant's  business.  However,  Mr.  Charlton   did   not
            recognise the Appellant's name. A copy of the  letter  was  then
            sent to Mr. Charlton who sent the following typed response;


             1. This person [IS] is unknown to me and I have  no  knowledge
                of him at all.


             2. The letter which you state in your 11/2/11 letter is not  a
                genuine letter from me and would appear a forgery.


             3. I have no intention at all of using any service which  this
                person states he is providing.


             4. These matters were covered in my recent telephone  call  to
                your office.


         The letter was headed with Mr. Charlton's address ...'

 9. Judge Myers detailed at �8 that the appellant had filed what 'purports'
    to be a handwritten letter from Mr. Charlton stating that he  had  told
    the respondent that 'he did not know the Appellant because he knows him
    by his nickname of Ibo and did not remember his  surname  and  at  that
    time he could not give the matter his full  attention  because  he  was
    preoccupied with his sick  father.'  Judge  Myers  observed  that  this
    letter detailed that Mr.  Charlton  intended  to  use  the  appellant's
    services.

10. Judge Myers concluded at ��10-11:

         '10. In my judgment the Respondent has  discharged  the  burden  of
            proof to show that the Appellant has used a  false  document.  I
            attach weight to the fact that the Appellant has not  taken  the
            opportunity of having an oral hearing and calling  Mr.  Charlton
            to give evidence on his behalf. I also attach weight to the fact
            that the letter relied upon by the appellant is handwritten  and
            does not give the writer's address,  and  the  telephone  number
            appears to be written by a different person, whereas the  letter
            sent by Mr. Charlton to UKBA is typed  and  gives  his  address.
            Furthermore, I do not find it credible  that  a  friend  of  the
            Appellant's, even if preoccupied by his father's illness,  would
            not have realised that the Appellant and 'Ibo' were one and  the
            same as the letter submitted to UKBA by the Appellant purporting
            to be from Mr. Charlton gives the  name  [IS].  I  place  little
            weight on the 2 letters addressed to Mr. Charlton purporting  to
            demonstrate authenticity; there are numerous ways in  which  the
            Appellant could have obtained them.


         11. Furthermore, even if I accepted  the  Appellant's  explanation,
            which I do not, this fails to address the issue of submitting  a
            forged letter. Mr Charlton states categorically that the  letter
            is not genuine and would appear a forgery. I therefore find that
            the Appellant has made  false  representations  and  used  false
            documents.'

11. The appellant did not seek to exercise his right of appeal to the Upper
    Tribunal against Judge Myers' decision. I observe that he made  another
    application  for  leave  to  remain  under  the  EU-Turkey  Association
    Agreement on 12 May 2011, less than 3 weeks after the  promulgation  of
    Judge Myers' decision. Ultimately, the appellant  was  unsuccessful  in
    securing leave to remain in this country.

12. The appellant asserts that he left the United Kingdom and  returned  to
    Turkey in December 2016. He states that in undertaking his  journey  he
    used a travel  document  obtained  from  a  Turkish  Consulate  as  the
    respondent was in possession of his passport. Before me the  respondent
    did not dispute that such document was secured and  that  such  journey
    had been undertaken.

13. In  respect  of  his  application  for  international  protection,  the
    appellant asserts that from January 2017 he was a member of, and active
    on behalf of, the HDP  (Halkin  Democratic  Partisi),  a  pro-minority,
    generally left-wing political party in Turkey. At the June 2015 general
    election, it became the third largest  parliamentary  group.  Following
    the 2016 coup attempt, the MP status of seven HDP parliamentarians  was
    revoked, and several party representatives remain under arrest.

14. The appellant states that  he  was  arrested  with  another  person  in
    December 2017 whilst distributing party leaflets. He was detained for 2
    days and ill-treated by police officers before being  released  without
    charge. The appellant addressed this detention at questions 80  to  109
    of his substantive  asylum  interview  held  on  7  December  2019.  He
    confirmed that he was asked about his links with the PKK.  He  detailed
    that during the course of his detention he sustained injuries. Upon his
    release he was required to sign a document, the contents  of  which  he
    was unaware. He simply signed it and went home. The  following  day  he
    attended a hospital where he remained for  3  hours,  was  treated  and
    returned to his home.

15. By means of his witness  statement,  dated  29  May  2019,  ('the  2019
    statement') the appellant details, inter alia, at ��10-11:

         'I was kept in detention for 2 days. During  my  detention,  I  was
         taken for interrogation on two  occasions  whilst  blindfolded  and
         handcuffed. I was  questioned  about  my  activities.  I  was  also
         questioned about my friend's involvement with HDP. They accused  me
         of being a PKK terrorist and having been involved  in  its  illegal
         activities. However, I denied the accusations.


         I was subjected to beatings and torture. They were verbally abusing
         me  throughout.  I  was  put   back   in   the   cell   after   the
         interrogations.'


16. He further states that he was arrested at  home  in  October  2018  and
    detained for 3 days. He addressed this detention at  questions  110  to
    134 of his substantive asylum interview.

17. He details by means of his 2019 statement, inter alia, at ��13-14:

         'My second detention was on the 10th October  2018.  my  house  was
         raided around 11pm. There were many heavily armed and masked police
         officers. There were four police officers outside of my  house.  It
         was terrifying. I thought that they  had  come  to  kill  me.  Many
         people have been killed by police in Turkey.


         They entered the house by force. My father, stepmother  and  sister
         were taken to the kitchen. I was pushed to the floor, and my  hands
         were handcuffed behind my back. They also put a sack over my  head.
         I was beaten, kicked and punched. ...'

18. He confirms that he was again ill-treated in detention, this time  with
    the additional use of electric shock,  before  being  released  without
    charge. Having been subjected to threats to kill, the appellant  states
    that he agreed to help the authorities in providing  names  of  persons
    involved with the PKK.

19. He asserts that he left Turkey in November 2018  and  arrived  in  this
    country 6 days later.

Hearing Before the FTT

20. The appeal came before Judge Kudhail sitting  at  Taylor  House  on  28
    February 2020. As noted above the record of  the  appellant's  evidence
    presented before the Judge, as detailed at  [17]-[21]  of  the  Judge's
    decision, has been preserved.

21. The appellant repeated his position as to the evidence of Mr. Charlton,
    stating that Mr. Charlton had subsequently sought to  confirm  that  he
    had authored the relevant letter and that had erred when informing  the
    respondent that the document was a forgery. The appellant's examination-
    in-chief and cross-examination on this issue is detailed  at  [17]-[18]
    of the decision.

22. In respect of  his  political  activism  the  appellant  confirmed,  as
    recorded at [19], inter alia:[1]

          . He was not politically active in the UK at the time [when he was
            first in this country] as he was in the  UK  illegally.  He  did
            attend meetings, but not active. It was more comfortable  to  be
            politically active in Turkey when he went back.


          . He did not mention he went to political meetings during his time
            in the UK prior to 2017 as he was not asked. He did not  mention
            this in his statement as he was not asked, he was told to answer
            the questions.


          . He started to be politically active once he returned  to  Turkey
            as he had sympathy whilst in the UK but he was not very  active.
            He did not mention his activity in the UK prior to going back as
            he was scared. He was arrested in Turkey  for  being  associated
            with PKK and propaganda.


          . He joined the HDP within one month of returning to Turkey.


          . Whilst in the UK he was a supporter of the Kurdish party HDP and
            had a picture of the leader Abdulla, who is the PKK  leader.  In
            Turkey, the HDP is a legal party and active.  One  can  do  what
            they like. Only if the person is related with the PKK  will  you
            get into trouble.


          . He became a member of HDP due to  his  interests  and  political
            views. He was aware that the members registered online,  so  the
            government are aware of  his  membership.  He  was  fundraising,
            attending rallies and going to demonstrations. He  had  his  HDP
            membership sent, as this is all he has as evidence.


          . The HDP have not provided  a  support  letter  as  he  left  the
            country illegally,  not  everything  he  did  with  the  HDP  is
            recited/reported or documented.


          . He went to the HDP party got the  letter  and  left  it  at  his
            father's [home]. His father sent the letter by post.

23. As regards the circumstances  of  his  second  arrest  the  appellant's
    evidence is recorded at [19], inter alia:

          . ... the second detention was at his home and  he  cannot  recall
            how many people were in his house  at  the  time  as  they  were
            having a meeting. There was around 15 people.


          . The police suspect he was giving a speech on the  PKK  but  they
            did not arrest others at the meeting. They said they were  doing
            terrorist propaganda and that is why they arrested him.


          . Only he was arrested as he was the leader  in  the  group.  They
            wanted information from him so asked him many questions such  as
            who is coming and leaving, who is living in  the  mountains  and
            giving them food.


          . The police were not suspicious of others in  the  house  as  the
            meeting had finished and people had gone home. It was  only  him
            and his family in the flat.


          . He did not mention that others in the meeting had  already  left
            in the [substantive asylum interview] as the immigration officer
            asked him to only answer the questions asked.


Evidence before this Tribunal

24. At the hearing Ms. Nnamani confirmed that she had had sight of  or  had
    had copied for her various documents that had been  placed  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal. They consisted of:

         i) A refusal letter issued by the respondent on 22  February  2011,
            refusing  the  appellant's   EU-Turkey   Association   Agreement
            application dated 9 November 2010.


        ii) Notice of decision issued by the  respondent  on  1  June  2011,
            refusing  the  appellant's   EU-Turkey   Association   Agreement
            application dated 12 May 2011.


       iii) Notice of decision issued by the respondent on 20 February 2012,
            refusing  the  appellant's   EU-Turkey   Association   Agreement
            application [date unknown]


        iv) A letter of the respondent dated 24 September 2012,  maintaining
            the decision to refuse  the  appellant's  EU-Turkey  Association
            Agreement application dated 20 February 2012 following a request
            for reconsideration dated 20 August 2012.

25. The appellant attended the hearing before me and gave evidence.

26. He explained that he had attended five treatment  sessions  with  ICope
    Islington, a psychological therapy service, from  August  to  September
    2019. A letter from  ICope  dated  9  August  2019  confirms  that  the
    treatment sessions were offered so as to permit him to focus on his low
    mood/depression. The appellant informed me that the sessions were  one-
    to-one, and he was provided with techniques to help him mentally relax.
    He was having difficulty in sleeping and was  depressed.  In  addition,
    the sessions were designed to help him not to relive flashbacks and  to
    help him conquer his fears. At the conclusion of the five sessions,  he
    was encouraged to undertake sporting activity. The appellant  confirmed
    that the sessions aided him in efforts to change his lifestyle.

27. In evidence, the appellant revisited his interaction with Mr. Charlton,
    explaining again that Mr. Charlton had offered to write the  letter  on
    his behalf and then informed the respondent that he did not author  the
    letter. The appellant was clear before me in asserting that he was  not
    to blame for the problem. Rather, Mr. Charlton was  someone  who  would
    say 'yes' to your face but 'no' behind your back.

28. In respect of why he became politically active the appellant  initially
    stated that he had 'political thoughts', that he had 'aims' and that he
    liked the HDP. When asked by Mr. Lindsay to provide greater  detail  as
    to his political thoughts, the appellant simply stated that  he  wanted
    'a freer, calmer lifestyle. Freedom of thought. Freedom  of  movement.'
    When asked again by Mr. Lindsay to detail his  political  thoughts  the
    appellant responded that there were bad  things  happening  and  so  he
    became involved as he 'wanted to be heard by others'. He explained that
    he participated politically by being involved in 'walks'  -  which  Ms.
    Nnamani  and  Mr.  Lindsay  agreed  was  a  reference  to   marches   -
    demonstrations and meetings.

29. The appellant informed me that he had  participated  in  demonstrations
    both in the United Kingdom, prior to leaving in 2016,  and  in  Turkey.
    When reminded that he had informed Judge Kudhail that he had  not  been
    politically active beyond  attending  meetings  when  in  this  country
    between 2010 and 2016 he responded that he was  'always  participating'
    in politics and during such time had attended an office  of  a  Kurdish
    organisation in Haringey, London.

30. He confirmed that he had been arrested  twice  in  Turkey.  Mr  Lindsay
    asked several  questions  in  respect  of  the  second  detention.  The
    appellant confirmed that he was arrested at around 11pm whilst at home.
    Also present were his father, his stepmother and  his  sister.  He  was
    reminded that he had informed Judge Kudhail that  a  political  meeting
    had taken place at his home prior to his arrest. He  denied  that  this
    was the case. He explained that the political  activists  had  gathered
    earlier in the afternoon at a coffee shop. By the evening everyone went
    their separate ways and he returned home.  Everyone  at  his  home  was
    preparing to go to bed when the police knocked on the door. When  asked
    by Mr Lindsay as to why he had informed Judge Kudhail  that  15  people
    had engaged in a political meeting at his home, and not as now asserted
    earlier in the day in a coffee shop, the appellant informed me that  he
    had told the Judge only that the authorities had  taken  him  from  his
    home.

Medical evidence

31. Upon confirming that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal was to  be
    set aside consequent to material error of law I adjourned  the  hearing
    in February 2021 having been informed by Ms. Nnamani that the appellant
    wished to file an addendum witness statement updating matters since  he
    attended before the First-tier  Tribunal.  I  was  informed  that  such
    evidence would primarily address his mental health.

32. A short two-page witness  statement  dated  23  June  2021  ('the  2021
    statement') was subsequently filed  with  the  Tribunal.  It  addressed
    historical events concerning  Mr.  Charlton  and  did  not,  as  I  had
    expected, engage with ongoing health concerns.  There  was  no  updated
    medical  evidence  beyond  that  relied  upon  before  the   First-tier
    Tribunal, which consisted of  a  medico-legal  report  authored  by  Dr
    Hajioff, dated 2 December 2019; a photograph of a  prescription  issued
    to the  appellant  in  Turkey  on  8  December  2017  and  its  English
    translation; a photograph of a prescription issued to the appellant  in
    Turkey on 13 October 2018 and its English translation;  a  prescription
    issued to the appellant in this country, dated 7 February  2019  and  a
    photograph of three boxes of medication issued to the appellant between
    February and June 2019.

33. I gave Ms. Nnamani time  to  obtain  instructions  as  to  whether  the
    appellant wished to secure and file up-to-date  medical  evidence.  Ms.
    Nnamani returned after a short break and informed me that the appellant
    was content to proceed with the hearing.

Report of Dr Hajioff

34. As to Dr. Hajioff's report, I note that  he  is  a  registered  medical
    practitioner and a consultant psychiatrist. It is understood  from  his
    report dated 2 December 2019  that  whilst  qualified  in  surgery  and
    general medicine, he has worked in the field  of  psychiatry  for  more
    than 30 years.

35. The appellant attended upon Dr Hajioff at a  consultation  held  on  29
    November 2019 which was, according to the appellant's  evidence  before
    Judge Kudhail, conducted for approximately 40 to 45 minutes. Dr Hajioff
    was provided with the appellant's 2019 statement.

36. The medical evidence before Dr  Hajioff  was  limited  to  two  medical
    prescriptions: one dated December 2017, the other October 2018. He  was
    provided with no other medical evidence, such as GP notes.

37. Dr Hajioff opined that  the  appellant  was  suffering  from  PTSD.  He
    assessed the appellant to be someone who  had  been  through  traumatic
    experiences, observing that he was less active than normal, had a  poor
    appetite, had lost weight, suffered disturbed sleep  and  had  impaired
    concentration.

38. Dr Hajioff concluded that scarring on the appellant's hands was typical
    of defence injuries. Dr Hajioff further  opined  that  a  scar  on  the
    appellant's right  upper  arm  and  a  scar  on  the  right  knee  were
    consistent with injuries from blunt instruments. It  is  not  explained
    how this could be the case in respect of the scar on the knee which the
    appellant asserted at  the  meeting  had  occurred  from  being  pushed
    downstairs and was not inflicted by a blunt instrument.

39. I observe that Dr Hajioff made  no  enquiries  as  to  the  appellant's
    history of employment. Ms. Nnamani kindly informed me  at  the  hearing
    that the appellant had worked as a farmer whilst in  Turkey  and  as  a
    handyman in this country.

40. The appellant was asked before me as to  whether  he  had  informed  Dr
    Hajioff that he had been attending sessions with ICope  in  respect  of
    low mood/depression and difficulties in sleeping. He  replied  that  he
    had disclosed this  information.  He  expressed  his  opinion  that  Dr
    Hajioff simply forgot to refer to it in his report.

41. The appellant provided a copy of a prescription  and  a  photograph  of
    boxes  of  medication.  The  identifiable  prescribed  medication   are
    Zoplicone, a sleeping tablet, and Sertraline, an  anti-depressant.  The
    later was prescribed at 50mgs which is a typical  dose  and  below  the
    maximum of 200mgs.

42. I observe that the appellant informed Dr Hajioff  at their  meeting  in
    November 2019, some five months after the photographed box of Zoplicone
    was dispensed, that he was no longer taking his prescribed  medication.
    The appellant complained to Dr Hajioff that he  was  enjoying  variable
    sleep, having nightmares about once a week, suffering anxiety, required
    a small nightlight when sleeping and had troubles  with  concentration.
    However, before me the appellant confirmed that he had  stopped  taking
    his medication in 2019 because  his  lifestyle  was  going  in  a  good
    direction, and he believed that  he  did  not  require  the  medication
    prescribed to him. He confirmed that at the time he  decided  to  forgo
    his medication he was feeling good in himself and living with both  his
    cousin and his cousin's family.

GP records

43. The appellant did not accept in answer to a question from  Mr.  Lindsey
    that he had failed to provide medical records including his GP records.
    He  was  adamant  that  he  had  handed  them  to  his  present   legal
    representatives. I simply note that the  very  limited  nature  of  the
    medical evidence filed with this Tribunal as detailed above.

Decision

44. It is for the appellant to prove, on the lower standard, that he is  at
    risk on return to Turkey of  serious  harm  such  as  would  constitute
    persecution, entitle him to humanitarian protection or engage article 3
    EHRC. In assessing the evidence of the appellant, I am mindful  of  the
    guidance in KB & AH (credibility - structured approach) Pakistan [2017]
    UKUT 00491 (IAC) and that provided by the Court of Appeal  in  SB  (Sri
    Lanka) v. Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2019]  EWCA  Civ
    160.

45. In relation to my assessment of the documentary  evidence  provided,  I
    adopt the approach in Tanveer Ahmed v. Secretary of State for the  Home
    Department [2002] Imm AR 318, at [35].

46. Ms. Nnamani requested that I consider the appellant to be a  vulnerable
    witness. She drew my attention to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note
    No  2  of  2010:  'Child,  vulnerable  adult  and  sensitive  appellant
    guidance' and as well as the guidance provided by the Court  of  Appeal
    in AM (Afghanistan) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2017]
    EWCA Civ 1123; [2017] Imm. A.R. 1508.  She  placed  reliance  upon  the
    medical evidence filed with the Tribunal, in particular the  report  of
    Dr Hajioff.

47. Ms. Nnamani  agreed  that  ultimately  the  question  of  vulnerability
    requires a holistic assessment. This has recently been  re-affirmed  by
    the Court of Appeal in MN v Secretary of State for the Home  Department
    [2020] EWCA Civ 1746, [2021] 1 W.L.R.  1956,  at  [121(1)].  Thus,  the
    decision whether the account given by  an  appellant  is  in  essential
    respects truthful has to be taken on  the  totality  of  the  evidence,
    viewed holistically.

48. I observe that the findings of Dr Hajioff are to be treated as part  of
    the holistic assessment, not as an 'add-on', and that medical  evidence
    can be critical in explaining why an account might be  inconsistent.  I
    note that the highest  standards  of  procedural  fairness  are  to  be
    applied when assessing vulnerability. In the  circumstances,  with  the
    respondent not accepting the appellant's stated personal history  after
    he returned to  Turkey  in  2016,  my  assessment  of  the  appellant's
    vulnerability  is  properly  to  be  considered  when  undertaking  the
    holistic assessment.

Mr Charlton

49. I observe the decision of Judge Myers and her findings of fact that the
    appellant made false representations and used a false  document  during
    the course of his  EU-Turkey  Association  Agreement  application.  The
    appellant repeated  his  evidence  before  me  that  Mr.  Charlton  had
    authored the reference letter provided to the respondent.

50. This is not an element of the appellant's case said by Ms.  Nnamani  to
    be potentially affected by vulnerability, as events took  place  before
    his return to Turkey.

51. I observe the approach to be adopted in respect of judicial findings of
    fact established by the Tribunal in the decision of Devaseelan  (Second
    Appeals - ECHR - Extra-Territorial Effect) Sri  Lanka  *  [2002]  UKIAT
    00702; [2003] Imm AR 1. I was not dissuaded from adopting this approach
    by Ms. Nnamani or Mr. Lindsay.

52. I have considered the appellant's 2021 statement with care, as well  as
    his oral evidence before me. There are significant concerns as  to  the
    evidence presented by means of this document, which is focused upon his
    interaction with Mr. Charlton. Underpinning the appellant's evidence is
    his assertion that Mr. Charlton  did  not  recognise  that  the  letter
    presented to him by the respondent concerned the appellant because  Mr.
    Charlton only knew him as 'Ibo'.

53. Previously, the  appellant  asserted  by  means  of  a  letter  to  the
    respondent   from   then   instructed    solicitors    that    previous
    representatives had misrepresented his  case  by  submitting  a  letter
    signed by Mr. Charlton; the letter having  been  pre-prepared  for  Mr.
    Charlton to sign. By a letter dated 24 September  2012  the  respondent
    observed that the appellant had provided no evidence that he had placed
    his former representatives on notice of such  allegation  and  that  no
    complaint had been made  to  the  relevant  professional  regulator  to
    investigate the matter. The respondent observed  that  the  failure  to
    provide such evidence raised questions as to  the  credibility  of  the
    assertion. In the  circumstances  the  respondent  concluded  that  the
    appellant's application was correctly refused  under  paragraph  21  of
    HC510, and the decision of 12 May 2011 was maintained.

54. By means of his 2021 statement the appellant adopts a different version
    of events. He details that Mr. Charlton had wanted to help him  and  so
    wrote the reference on his behalf.  There  is  no  assertion  that  Mr.
    Charlton simply signed a pre-prepared letter. Rather,  the  appellant's
    evidence as now presented to me  is  that  Mr.  Charlton  authored  the
    letter. On this version  of  events,  it  must  be  that  he  knew  the
    appellant's full name as he detailed it in the  letter.  The  appellant
    must, on this version of events, have personally provided Mr.  Charlton
    with his full name. Therefore, if  Mr.  Charlton  genuinely  wrote  the
    letter, he must have been aware of the full name of the person he  knew
    as 'Ibo'. The appellant's evidence before me on this  issue  is  simply
    nonsensical, as recognised by Judge Myers at �10 of her decision.

55. I am satisfied on balance that Mr. Charlton was honest  when  informing
    the respondent that the letter was not  genuine  upon  considering  the
    document presented to him.  He  would  be  expected  to  recall  having
    authored the letter or having been provided with a pre-prepared copy to
    sign. I am satisfied that the  failure  by  the  appellant  to  make  a
    complaint against his previous legal representatives,  as  observed  by
    the respondent in her letter of 24 September 2012, was due to his being
    aware that a properly conducted investigation would establish that  the
    legal representatives had not acted in the manner  asserted.  The  fact
    that the appellant has not repeated  this  allegation  before  me,  but
    rather adopts a different version of  events,  strongly  suggests  that
    such allegation possessed no merits.

56. I conclude  that  the  appellant  made  false  representations  to  the
    respondent and willingly used a false document  in  seeking  to  secure
    further leave to remain in  this  country.  I  further  find  that  the
    appellant  has  proven  willing  to  made   serious,   and   unfounded,
    allegations against his former legal  representatives  and  has  proven
    willing  to  vary  and  amend  his  evidence  whenever  previous  false
    assertions have been identified. I further find that he has  sought  to
    exercise manipulative behaviour.

57.  However,  that  he  adopted  such  an  approach  with  regard  to  his
    application for leave to remain in 2011 does not per se  mean  that  he
    has adopted such approach  in  this  matter.  I  therefore  proceed  to
    consider his present claim with appropriate anxious scrutiny.

Decision on claim for international protection

58. I note Mr. Lindsay's acceptance on behalf of the  respondent  that  the
    appellant's account is consistent with  background  objective  material
    and  therefore  plausible.  However,  as  observed   by   Mr   Lindsay,
    plausibility does not necessarily  equate  to  credibility.  Ouseley  J
    observed in MM (DRC - plausibility) Democratic Republic of Congo [2005]
    UKIAT 00019; [2005] Imm AR 198  that  while  it  is  correct  that  the
    assessment of credibility may involve an assessment of plausibility  of
    what has been said, such assessment is not  a  separate  stage  in  the
    assessment of credibility. A story can be implausible and yet be  taken
    as credible, and vice versa. A decision as to whether an  appellant  is
    credible should properly be founded on the totality  of  the  evidence,
    including consistency on essentials or major inconsistencies, omissions
    and details, improbabilities or reasonableness.

59. Adopting a holistic approach,  I  initially  proceed  to  consider  the
    evidence of Dr Hajioff. The weight to be  given  to  an  expression  of
    opinion by a medical expert will depend on  the  circumstances  of  the
    particular case. It is for the Tribunal is to decide in  each  case  to
    what extent its value can appropriately be discounted.

60. The Court of Appeal confirmed in MN, at [121(6)], that a factor bearing
    on the weight to be given to an expression of opinion by a doctor  that
    the appellant's reported symptoms support their  case  that  they  were
    persecuted  is  whether  there  are  other  possible  causes  of  those
    symptoms. Underhill LJ observed that 'there may very  well  be  obvious
    other potential causes in cases of this kind. If  the  expert  has  not
    considered that question that does not justify excluding it  altogether
    ... It may diminish the value that can be put on their opinion, but the
    extent to which that is so will depend on the likelihood of such  other
    causes operating in the particular case and producing the  symptoms  in
    question.'

61. In respect of the scars to the right arm, said to be consistent with  a
    blunt instrument injury, and on the hands, identified as being  typical
    of defence injuries, Dr Hajioff confirms in his  report  that  he  made
    enquiries as to other possible  causes  for  these  injuries.  However,
    there is no express consideration as  to  whether  such  injuries  were
    consistent with someone who had worked on a farm or as a  handyman.  In
    such circumstances I find that the failure to  assess  the  appellant's
    employment history as a possible cause  of  the  injuries  lessens  the
    weight that can be placed upon Dr Hajioff's medical  opinion  upon  the
    causes of these injuries.

62.  As  previously  observed,  Dr  Hajioff  identified  the  scar  on  the
    appellant's  knee  to  be  consistent   with   injuries   from   'blunt
    instruments', when the appellant informed him that it was caused  after
    he was pushed downstairs. I conclude that no weight can be placed on Dr
    Hajioff's opinion on this scar.

63. I proceed to consider the appellant's evidence being  aware  that  some
    weight may  be  placed  upon  Dr  Hajioff's  opinion  in  the  holistic
    assessment.

64. I observe the appellant's HDP membership form placed within his  appeal
    bundle confirming that he became a member of the party  on  15  January
    2017. Mr. Lindsay did not address the document and I am satisfied  that
    this  is  a  genuine  document.  However,   it   does   not   establish
    determinatively that the appellant was a committed activist  on  behalf
    of the party in Turkey, nor that  his  stated  history  of  arrest  and
    detention is genuine. However, I place some weight upon the document. I
    also observe the letter from the Kurdish People's  Democratic  Assembly
    in Britain, dated  5  February  2020,  confirming  that  the  appellant
    volunteers at a  community  centre  and  actively  joins  in  cultural,
    political and educational activities. The document is one that can only
    enjoy limited weight, presenting very  limited  aid  in  assessing  the
    credibility of the appellant's stated personal history in Turkey.

65. I turn to the appellant's second detention as  there  is  on  its  face
    clear inconsistency in his evidence as to events. As I observed to  the
    representatives  at  the  hearing  the  appellant's  evidence  at   his
    substantive interview held on 7 December 2019 lacks clarity as  to  the
    events of 10 October 2018, particularly in respect of  when  and  where
    the political meeting was held. The answer to Q110 commences  with,  'I
    was in the village during the day and meet [sic] my party friends  from
    the neighbouring villages to helping [sic] the party.' The answer  then
    proceeds, 'Our home is 2 stories and I saw from the  balcony  that  our
    home has been surrounded by the police.' It is unclear from the  record
    of interview as  to  when  and  where  the  meeting  was  held.  It  is
    unfortunate that the interviewer did not ask for further detail on this
    matter.

66. As is clear from  her  decision  letter  dated  17  January  2020,  the
    respondent understood the appellant's evidence to be that  he  was  the
    only person arrested in the midst of a political meeting being held  at
    his home.

67. The appellant details in his witness statement of 29 May 2019 that  his
    detention occurred when his house was raided by the  police  at  around
    11pm. He does not address the respondent's understanding  that  he  was
    arrested at a political meeting held at his home. However,  at  ��11-12
    of his witness statement dated 13 February 2020 ('the 2020  statement')
    the appellant states.

         '11. The Home Office then considers my second  detention.  However,
            it shows a lack of understanding of what we political  activists
            face in Turkey. Just because the police detained me, it does not
            mean that they will arrest everyone at the gathering. I was  one
            of the leading figures there, so that is why I was targeted.


         12. With regard to being of interest to the police, the  fact  that
            they came to my family home  looking  for  me  confirms  that  I
            wanted. If I were returned, I would be arrested immediately.'

68. I am satisfied that the appellant's second witness  statement  confirms
    his evidence at the time to be that he  was  arrested  at  a  political
    meeting held at his home. I observe that there is no assertion that the
    respondent's decision letter incorrectly understood events.

69. Judge Kudhail records the  appellant's  evidence  in  cross-examination
    that he was at home when detained, 'but cannot recall how  many  people
    were in his house at the time as they were having a meeting. There were
    around 15 people.' I again observe counsel's acceptance at the  hearing
    in February 2021 that the Judge's record of  the  appellant's  evidence
    was accurate and  could  properly  be  preserved.  At  [35]  the  Judge
    extrapolates the appellant's evidence as being  that  the  arrest  took
    place after the meeting ended.

70. The appellant's evidence before me significantly differs to the history
    previously advanced. It can properly be identified as  one  of  several
    versions advanced by the appellant during the course of his claim:  (i)
    he was arrested at a meeting held at his home; (ii) a meeting was  held
    at the house, but attendees had left before  the  police  arrived;  and
    (iii) the meeting was held in a coffee house earlier  in  the  day  and
    when it ended, he returned home and was subsequently  detained.  I  was
    informed that only family members were present in the house when he was
    arrested. The appellant denied previously stating  that  the  political
    meeting took place at his house.

71. Having considered the evidence carefully, I  find  that  the  appellant
    sought to amend his evidence before me. I am not required  to  decipher
    why the appellant changed his evidence on an  issue  important  to  his
    appeal, but I am satisfied that he is untruthful when asserting that he
    had not previously stated  that  he  was  arrested  after  a  political
    meeting had been held at his home. It is clear  to  me  that  his  oral
    evidence before Judge Kudhail was correctly recorded, and the appellant
    was not truthful in his denial of such fact.

72.  I  find,  in  the  circumstances,  that  the  appellant   has   proven
    inconsistent on a key element of his evidence in respect of the  second
    detention and is untruthful as to  his  having  been  arrested  by  the
    authorities on 10 October 2018. There was no arrest, detention and ill-
    treatment on that day. I consequently find that the appellant  was  not
    threatened with death, was not released on restrictive  conditions  and
    was not required to provide information in respect of the PKK following
    the purported arrest and detention on 10 October 2018.

73. Mr. Lindsay confirmed that the appellant's evidence  as  to  his  first
    arrest in December 2017 was plausible in light  of  relevant  objective
    material. However, Mr. Lindsay detailed on  behalf  of  the  respondent
    that the appellant's  credibility  was  undermined  by  the  vague  and
    inconsistent evidence he provided as to his political activity both  in
    Turkey and in this country.

74. The appellant informed me that he had participated in demonstrations in
    the United Kingdom prior to leaving  the  country  in  2016  and  again
    subsequently in  Turkey.  He  further  detailed  that  he  was  'always
    participating' in Kurdish  political  matters  prior  to  returning  to
    Turkey in December 2016. He joined the HDP the following month. He  was
    not asked at his substantive  asylum  interview  as  to  his  political
    activity in this country between 2010 and 2016. His 2019  statement  is
    silent as to any political activity  during  that  time.  In  his  2020
    witness statement, he is also silent as to political activity  in  this
    country prior to returning to Turkey. Before Judge Kudhail he confirmed
    that he was  not  politically  active  in  the  United  Kingdom  before
    leaving, though he clarified this by stating he did attend meetings but
    was not active: [19(e)]. I note the appellant's evidence before me that
    he was participating in demonstrations in this  country  prior  to  his
    leaving in 2016. Being mindful of the relevant low standard of proof, I
    do not accept that this evidence  is  true.  I  find  that  whilst  the
    appellant may have attended some meetings within the Kurdish  community
    in this country, he was not politically active in the six years  up  to
    2016, nor did he engage in attending demonstrations. I find that he has
    made these false assertions to try  to  explain  why  he  would  become
    engaged in political activism so soon after his  return  to  Turkey.  I
    further find that his attendance at meetings between 2010 and 2016  was
    of such limited nature that there is  no  real  likelihood,  indeed  no
    likelihood at  all,  that  he  aroused  any  interest  in  the  Turkish
    authorities.

75. Ms. Nnamani tentatively suggested that  the  appellant  being  held  on
    return to  Turkey  in  2016  for  several  hours  and  interviewed  was
    suggestive that he was a person  of  interest.  However,  I  find  that
    having returned to Turkey on a document issued by a Consulate, and  not
    being in possession of a passport, the authorities  were  concerned  to
    establish that the appellant was who he said he was and that he  was  a
    Turkish national. Such procedure could properly take several  hours.  I
    find that the authorities had no interest in him save for  establishing
    his identity and nationality.

76. In his interview the  appellant  detailed  that  the  authorities  were
    interested in him because of his membership of and  his  work  for  the
    HDP,  and  consequently  he  was  identified  by  the  authorities   as
    'belonging' to the PKK. He discussed the aims and leadership of the HDP
    party at questions 156 to 160  of  his  substantive  asylum  interview,
    identifying it as a left-wing  political  party.  At  the  hearing  the
    appellant was asked by Mr. Lindsay to explain why he became politically
    active,  to  elucidate  his  political  thoughts  and  to  provide   an
    explanation as to why he became politically active upon his  return  to
    Turkey. I agree with Mr. Lindsay that the answers to  these  questions,
    detailed at para. 28 above, are very vague  and  it  is  striking  that
    someone who states that they committed themselves to a political  party
    that by 2017 was experiencing repression at the hands  of  the  Turkish
    authorities would be incapable of coherently  detailing  his  political
    views and the reasons as to why he engaged in political  activity  upon
    behalf of the HDP. I observe that it is the appellant's case before  me
    that he was politically active in Turkey, speaking at events and  being
    considered a local leader, but he has  entirely  failed  to  provide  a
    reasonable depth of knowledge as  to  the  HDP  or  his  own  political
    thoughts as would be expected by somebody who  states  that  they  were
    politically engaged over several months and years.

77. I am mindful of Dr Hajioff's opinion that the  appellant  has  suffered
    from PTSD arising from serious ill-treatment  and  observe  that  in  a
    holistic assessment such evidence could potentially aid  the  appellant
    in establishing his case  to  the  appropriate  standard  of  proof.  I
    proceed to  consider  whether  the  inconsistencies  and  discrepancies
    identified above could arise from  the  appellant  being  a  vulnerable
    witness.

78. In SS (Sri Lanka) v Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2012]
    EWCA Civ 155, at [30] the Court of Appeal confirmed:

         '30.  It is essential that those who are asked  to  provide  expert
         reports, be they  medical  or  otherwise,  are  provided  with  the
         documents relevant to the  matters  they  are  asked  to  consider.
         Failure to do so is bound to lead to the critical scrutiny  of  the
         expert's report, and may lead to  the  rejection  of  the  opinions
         expressed in that report, as it did in this case.'

79. I observe that Dr Hajioff was provided with very little information  as
    to the appellant's circumstances beyond a  witness  statement  and  two
    medical prescriptions. He was not made aware of  the  earlier  judicial
    finding that the appellant had used deceit in his engagement  with  the
    respondent. Further, he was not provided  with  relevant  GP  notes  or
    information provided by the  appellant  to  secure  his  attendance  at
    ICope.

80. On the appellant's evidence the  treatment  provided  by  ICope  proved
    successful. Having heard the appellant discuss his  treatment  and  its
    benefits in detail at the hearing I find that he did attend ICope for 5
    weeks. Indeed, I observe that the strong detail he provided as  to  his
    engagement with ICope was in marked contrast to the very limited detail
    he was able to provide as to his political  thoughts  and  the  reasons
    underlying his political engagement with HDP. I further find  that  his
    ability to secure such treatment was consequent to the  information  he
    provided as to his mental health, which I address below.

81. Dr Hajioff was significantly reliant upon the appellant being  accurate
    in the reciting of his personal history  and  health  concerns.  Having
    read the medical report with care it  is  striking  that  there  is  no
    reference to the appellant's engagement with ICope. As explained to  me
    by the appellant this service provided him with treatment  sessions  to
    enable him to mentally relax, and to permit him to  focus  on  his  low
    mood/depression. Dr  Hajioff  specifically  addresses  the  appellant's
    medical history at �12 of his report and there is no reference  to  the
    recent treatment with ICope, which concluded some two months before the
    consultation. The appellant was specifically asked by Dr Hajioff as  to
    his present state and his answers  were  recorded  at  ��32  to  38.  I
    observe at �38  that  the  appellant  refers  to  being  advised  by  a
    psychologist to become more physically active. This could be an oblique
    reference to ICope, which provides psychological therapy services,  but
    the information recorded by Dr. Hajioff  is  expressly  concerned  with
    physical activity and does not refer to  the  mental  health  treatment
    provided by ICope. The appellant states that he informed Dr Hajioff  as
    to his treatment with ICope and that Dr Hajioff simply forgot to  refer
    to it in his report. I observe Dr Hajioff's long history  of  providing
    reports in asylum matters. I am satisfied  that  Dr  Hajioff  would  be
    aware as to the importance of beneficial mental health  treatment  when
    making his diagnosis and I am satisfied, on balance, that  he  was  not
    informed as to the appellant's attendance at ICope and so was  ignorant
    both of the treatment provided to the appellant and as to the  decision
    to  no  longer  rely  upon  prescriptive  medication  in  relation   to
    depression and sleep.

82. There is a clear inconsistency in this matter  as  to  the  appellant's
    evidence before me that having  attended  ICope  he  was  feeling  well
    enough to no longer require  prescribed  medication  and  the  personal
    history he presented to Dr. Hajioff. The appellant was unable to detail
    a day or month on which he made his  decision  to  no  longer  use  his
    medication. However, it must have been on date after 20 June 2019, as I
    have been presented with a photograph  of  an  open  box  of  Zopicione
    dispensed to the appellant on that date, and prior  to  his  attendance
    upon Dr Hajioff on 29 November 2019.

83. Further, in the absence of GP notes  and  any  other  medical  evidence
    postdating the appellant's attendance upon Dr Hajioff, I  observe  that
    there is no medical evidence before me establishing that the  appellant
    has  sought  to  resume  pharmaceutical  intervention  in  relation  to
    depression or sleeping difficulties.

84. Despite having decided to no longer use the  medication  provided,  the
    appellant informed Dr Hajioff that  he  was  enjoying  variable  sleep,
    having nightmares about once a  week,  suffering  anxiety,  required  a
    small nightlight when sleeping and  had  troubles  with  concentration.
    Having considered the evidence  before  me  I  am  satisfied  that  the
    appellant deliberately decided not to  inform  Dr  Hajioff  as  to  his
    treatment with ICope, and further that  he  deliberately  withheld  his
    true medical history at  the  assessment.  I  am  satisfied  that  such
    deliberate acts were manipulative in nature. His primary intention  was
    to persuade Dr Hajioff  that he  had  PTSD  arising  from  torture  and
    serious ill-treatment at the  hands  of  the  Turkish  authorities  and
    therefore provided false information to secure  his  aim.  In  reaching
    this conclusion, I recall the  appellant's  willingness  to  engage  in
    manipulation, deceit and untruths. I am  therefore  satisfied  that  no
    weight can properly be given to the report of Dr Hajioff because he was
    not provided with  truthful  information  and  was  misled  as  to  the
    appellant's symptoms. Further,  I  find  that  the  appellant  was  not
    truthful in securing treatment from ICope. He is not,  and  have  never
    been, a vulnerable person.

85. In such circumstances I return to my consideration of the first arrest.
    I acknowledge that the information provided to the  respondent  at  the
    substantive  interview  is  plausible  in  light   of   known   country
    circumstances existing in Turkey at the  relevant  time.  However,  the
    appellant has been manipulative and untruthful in his engagement with a
    medical practitioner. He has exercised deceit and used false  documents
    in  the  past.  I  therefore  place  limited  weight  on  the   Turkish
    prescriptions filed with the Tribunal. He has not been truthful to  the
    Tribunal on various issues. Importantly, the appellant has  shown  very
    limited political knowledge as would be expected by  someone  asserting
    that they were a committed political activist. In  such  circumstances,
    whilst bearing in mind the low standard of proof to be applied in  this
    matter, I find that whilst the appellant joined the  HDP  in  2017  his
    activities  on  behalf  of  the  party  were  extremely  limited.   The
    noticeable lack of any substantive knowledge as to the party or even as
    to his own  political  thoughts  clearly  establish  that  he  was  not
    politically active. I find that he was  not  distributing  leaflets  in
    December 2017, was not arrested by the Turkish authorities along with a
    friend, was not detained and was not subsequently  ill-treated  by  the
    Turkish authorities.

86. I conclude that the appellant has never been arrested  by  the  Turkish
    authorities, nor has he been a political leader in his area or actively
    participated in meetings, marches and demonstrations. At most,  he  has
    been a passive member of the HDP with irregular attendance at meetings.
    He enjoys no profile that would lead to his arrest and  detention  upon
    his return to Turkey. Though some members of the HDP have been arrested
    and harassed by  the  Turkish  authorities,  it  remains  a  legal  and
    functioning political party and in light of his very limited  political
    engagement the appellant's membership of the party, without more, is of
    no interest to the authorities.

87. In the circumstances, the appellant does  not  possess  a  well-founded
    fear of persecution. He will not be detained on return to Turkey. He is
    of no interest to the Turkish authorities. There is no real  risk  that
    he will be subject to treatment that will breach his protected  article
    2 and 3 rights upon his return home.

88. Ms. Nnamani confirmed that the appellant does not rely upon article 8.
