Representation:

For the Appellant:       Mr N Paramjorthy (Counsel) instructed by S Satha &
Co, solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms A Everett, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1. I make an anonymity order under Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008, precluding publication of  any  information  regarding
the proceedings which would be likely to  lead  members  of  the  public  to
identify  the  appellant.  I  make  the  order  to  preserve  the  anonymity
direction made by the First tier Tribunal.


2. This is an appeal by the Appellant against  the  decision  of  First-tier
Tribunal Judge Devittie promulgated on 20  November  2015,  which  dismissed
the Appellant's appeal.



Background


3. The Appellant was born on 22 August 1966 and is a national of Sri Lanka.

4. On  27  March  2015  the  Secretary  of  State  refused  the  Appellant's
application for asylum.


The Judge's Decision

5. The Appellant appealed to the First-tier  Tribunal.  First-tier  Tribunal
Judge Devittie ("the Judge") dismissed the appeal against  the  Respondent's
decision.

6. Grounds of appeal were lodged and on  15  December  2015  Judge  Chambers
gave permission to appeal stating inter alia

      "4. The Judge did not believe the Appellant had been involved  in  any
      of the claimed LTTE activity (paragraph 9) but did  not  give  reasons
      why the account was rejected. That failure  constitutes  an  error  of
      law."

The Hearing

7(a) Mr Paramjorthy, counsel for the appellant, adopted  the  terms  of  the
grounds of appeal and told me that  this  case  concerned  two  issues.  The
first focused on [6(ii)] where it is argued that the appellant's  apparently
poor performance  at  asylum  interview  is  the  Judge's  sole  reason  for
rejecting the appellant's claim. Mr Paramjorthy told me that the  Judge  has
given little scrutiny to either the witness  statement  or  the  appellant's
oral evidence. As a result,  he  argued  that  the  pivotal  aspect  of  the
appellant's  claim  for  international  protection  has  been   given   only
superficial treatment. He told me that at [6(ii)] the Judge simply sets  out
a prï¿½cis of what is contained in the asylum interview record.


(b) The second issue that is argued is contained at  [7]  of  the  decision,
where Mr Paramjorthy told me that the Judge  considers  medical  evidence  &
finds that it creates an inconsistency  in  the  evidence,  when  the  Judge
should have considered the principles in Tanveer Ahmed and  found  that  the
medical evidence was demonstrative of an injury rather than a  factor  which
undermined the appellants evidence. He told me that, for  the  avoidance  of
doubt, the challenge was that the Judge's findings there are irrational.

8. Ms Everett, for the respondent,  told  me  that  the  decision  does  not
contain any errors, material or otherwise,  and  that  the  Judge  sets  out
cogent reasons for rejecting the appellant's account. She told me  that  the
Judge sets out his reasons for coming to the  view  that  the  appellant  is
neither a credible nor a reliable witness, and that  the  findings  made  by
the Judge are well within the range of findings available to the Judge.  She
took me to  [10]  of  the  decision,  and  told  me  that  there  the  Judge
considered the  appellant's  case  at  its  highest;  then  the  Judge  took
guidance from the case of GJ and  Others  (post-civil  war:  returnees)  Sri
Lanka CG [2013] UKUT 00319 (IAC), and (it was argued) then  correctly  found
that the appellant did not fall into the risk categories identified there.

Analysis

9. At [6] the Judge sets out in detail the factors which he finds  undermine
the appellant's overall credibility. Counsel for the  appellant  focuses  on
[6(ii)], but that subparagraph must be read in  the  context  of  [6]  as  a
whole. It is not true  that  the  Judge  found  that  the  appellant's  poor
performance at asylum interview alone was determinative of this appeal.  The
Judge considered the  appellant's  immigration  history  and  his  delay  in
claiming  asylum  as  factors  which  damaged  the  appellant's  credibility
(which, of course, he must  do  in  terms  of  the  Asylum  and  Immigration
(Treatment of Claimants etc.) Act 2004).

10. At [6(ii)] the Judge sets out comprehensive  reasons  for  finding  that
the appellant does not give a  coherent  account  at  asylum  interview.  No
challenge is taken to  the  Judge's  findings  in  relation  to  the  asylum
interview, and the content of the asylum interview  is  clearly  a  relevant
consideration in  assessing  credibility.  Neither  the  appellant  nor  his
representatives sought to amend the  record  of  asylum  interview,  and  no
challenge is taken by the appellant to the record  of  asylum  interview  in
his witness statement dated 13 October 2015.

11. In reality, the challenge which  is  set  out  at  paragraph  2  of  the
grounds of appeal amounts to little more than a disagreement  with  findings
of fact which were within the range of findings available to the Judge.  The
appellant's witness statement specifically adopts the terms  of  the  asylum
interview (at paragraph 2) for the details of  the  appellant's  claim.  The
only elaboration of the claim is contained in eight  lines  of  the  witness
statement, where no real detail is added to the appellant's account of  what
happened to him in Sri Lanka.  The  remainder  of  the  appellant's  account
dwells on the appellant's activities in the UK.

12. It is not, therefore, surprising that at [6] and  [7]  the  Judge  takes
account of the appellant's asylum interview, because that  is  exactly  what
the appellant asked the Judge to  do  in  the  witness  statement  which  he
adopted as his evidence in chief.

13. It is argued that the Judge's findings at [7] are irrational.  There  is
no merit in that submission.  The  Judge  finds  that  the  medical  records
produced creates an inconsistency in the  appellant's  account  rather  than
provide support for the appellant's account.  The  Judge  does  not  suggest
that the medical record is a fabrication, but specifically finds that  there
is an inconsistency which undermines  the  credibility  of  the  appellant's
claim. That is a finding which is manifestly open to the Judge to make.

14. At paragraph 49 of MA (Somalia) [2010] UKSC 49, it was said that  "Where
a tribunal has referred to considering all the evidence,  a  reviewing  body
should be very slow to conclude that that tribunal overlooked  some  factor,
simply  because  the  factor  is  not  explicitly   referred   to   in   the
determination concerned". McCombe LJ  in  VW(Sri  Lanka)  C5/2012/3037  said
"Regrettably, there is an increasing tendency in immigration cases,  when  a
First-tier Tribunal Judge  has  given  a  judgment  explaining  why  he  has
reached a particular decision, of seeking to burrow out industriously  areas
of evidence that have been less fully dealt with than  others  and  then  to
use this as a basis for  saying  the  judge's  decision  is  legally  flawed
because it did not  deal  with  a  particular  matter  more  fully.   In  my
judgment, with respect, that is no  basis  on  which  to  sustain  a  proper
challenge to a judge's finding of fact"

15.    In Shizad (sufficiency of reasons: set aside) [2013]  UKUT  85  (IAC)
the Tribunal held that the Upper Tribunal would not  normally  set  aside  a
decision of the First-tier Tribunal where there has been no misdirection  of
law, the fact-finding process cannot be criticised and the relevant  Country
Guidance has been taken into  account,  unless  the  conclusions  the  judge
draws from the primary data were not reasonably open to him or her.

16. The Judge carefully considered each strand  of  evidence  placed  before
him. He carefully records the submissions that were  made  and  then,  after
correctly directing himself in law, makes reasoned findings of  fact  before
reaching conclusions which were manifestly open to the Judge to reach.

17.   I find that the Judge's decision, when  read  as  a  whole,  sets  out
findings that are sustainable and sufficiently detailed and based on  cogent
reasoning. The decision does not contain a material error of law.

CONCLUSION

18. No errors of law have been established. The Judge's decision stands.

DECISION

19. The appeal  is  dismissed.  The  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
stands.
