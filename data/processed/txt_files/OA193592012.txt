                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


    1. The SSHD appeals against  a  determination  by  First-tier  Tribunal
       Judge Quigley,  dismissing  his  appeal  against  refusal  of  entry
       clearance as a spouse.


    2. The grounds dispute the judge's finding on maintenance, pointing out
       that the sponsor has "three children in the UK,  with  one  son  who
       suffers from addiction problems and is dependent upon her".

    3. Mrs O'Brien said that the grounds had apparently  been  prepared  on
       the basis of the determination only.  The author would not have been
       aware of the underlying reality  that  the  sponsor's  children  are
       adult, and the financial dependency of any of them upon the  sponsor
       had not been one of the issues in the case.

    4. The evidence before the judge was enough to satisfy her  as  to  the
       maintenance requirements of the rules.  The grounds of appeal to the
       UT do not raise any other issue.

    5. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.
