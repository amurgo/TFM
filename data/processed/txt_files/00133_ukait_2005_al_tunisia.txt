Funding order under s.103D of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act
2002 as amended by the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants etc.)
Act 2004 not available in Fast Track cases (Community Legal Service (Asylum
and Immigration Appeals) Regulations 2005 rule 4(2)).

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1. This is the reconsideration of the determination of an Immigration Judge
   (Miss J Plumptre), who dismissed the appellant's appeal against the
   refusal of the Secretary of State to recognise him as a refugee and the
   setting of removal directions to Tunisia, where the appellant claimed to
   have a well-founded fear of persecution on grounds of his religion and
   imputed political opinion.  This determination is reported for what it
   says at paragraph 56 about funding orders in fast track appeals.

2. The Immigration Judge heard the appellant's appeal under the Asylum and
   Immigration Tribunal (Fast Track) Rules 2005.  The appellant has been in
   detention continuously since service of notice of the immigration
   decision against which he is appealing.  The reconsideration hearing was
   heard by two Senior Immigration Judges.  This Tribunal is required to
   give its written determination not later than two days after the day on
   which the hearing of the appeal finishes, that is, in the present appeal,
   not later than Wednesday 28 September 2005.

3. Pursuant to rule 22 of the Fast Track rules, fresh evidence may only be
   considered where a party has notified the Tribunal and the other party of
   the nature of the evidence and the reasons why it was not submitted on
   any previous occasion.  The only such evidence with which we were
   presented was an update email from Mr Joffï¿½, and there was no objection
   to our considering that; it is in the nature of a response to the
   previous Immigration Judge's determination and we are satisfied that for
   that reason it could not have been submitted at the Immigration Judge
   hearing.

   Error of law hearing

4. The appellant is a Muslim man from Tunisia.  The core of the appellant's
   claim is that he was arrested twice, once in 1992 and once in 2000, and
   on each occasion he was charged with being a member of an unspecified
   Islamist organisation involved in anti-Government activities and
   sentenced to imprisonment, one year on the first occasion and eight
   months on the second.  The appellant left Tunisia in 2005, with the help
   of an agent, as he had been refused a passport by the Tunisian
   authorities on many occasions.  The appellant entered the United Kingdom
   clandestinely.  He fears return as he is now an absconder and will be
   tortured, detained and imprisoned on return.

5. This claim turns on the credibility of the core account, which the
   Immigration Judge found completely incredible.  Given the appellant's
   clandestine entry to the United Kingdom, allegedly on 27 July 2005, and
   his failure to claim asylum until arrested on 28 July 2005, it was not
   open to the Immigration Judge to find him entirely credible (s.8 (6)
   Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants etc.) Act 2004); the
   question for us is the extent to which it is proper to regard his
   credibility as damaged.  We have regard to the matters set out in the
   letter of refusal dated 4 August 2005 which raised the following issues -

        a) if the police followed everyone, then the appellant was not
           personally targeted (paragraph 14);
        b) the charge of belonging to an Islamist group and working against
           the Tunisian Government was too vague to be credible (paragraph
           15);
        c) the sentences of one year, and eight months, are
           disproportionate to the sentence in the US State Department
           Report for 2004 for a Mr Zirda who contacted the banned Islamist
           party An-Nadha  and was sentenced to seven years (paragraph 16);
        d) not attending large gatherings was a minor restriction and if
           the police were genuinely interested in the appellant,
           surveillance measures would have been added (paragraph 17);
        e) there were no problems between 1993 and 2000; the appellant had
           an internal relocation option as the rest of his family, all
           Muslims living elsewhere in Tunisia, had no difficulties
           (paragraph 18);
        f) the appellant's account of his relations with the people at his
           mosque was confusing and vague (paragraph 19);
        g) the appellant could not explain why his second sentence was
           shorter than the first for the same offence and the Secretary of
           State did not accept that the marks on his leg substantiated
           torture claims (paragraph 20);
        h) signing on at the police station was insufficient to engage the
           Refugee Convention, especially as the appellant had been
           financially comfortable and never without work (paragraph 21);
        i) the appellant remained in Tunisia for five years after his
           second release (paragraph 27) and only claimed asylum after
           being arrested (paragraph 28), which damaged his credibility
           under section 8 Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants
           etc.) Act 2004;

6. The appellant's Refugee Convention claim, and claims under Articles 2, 3
   and 8 ECHR were refused.  The appellant appealed, but did not renew his
   Article 8 claim; his family are all in Tunisia.  The appellant continues
   to rely on the Refugee Convention, and on Articles 2 and 3 of the ECHR.
   The Immigration Judge accepted the appellant's evidence that he spoke to
   a police officer to seek asylum but for the reasons set out below, we
   cannot treat her credibility assessment as fully considered and reasoned.

7. The appellant's initial application for reconsideration failed; he
   renewed it to the Administrative Court and was successful, all grounds
   for review are arguable.  We asked Ms Sethi to speak to her grounds for
   review and her submissions, together with those of Dr Smith, are fully
   recorded in the record of proceedings.  The Tribunal was satisfied that
   there was a significant factual error in paragraph 19 of the
   determination where the Immigration Judge considered that -

      "I give weight to the fact that at Q22 AIR on page B11 [the appellant]
      said that the only condition on his release from prison in 1993 was
      the 'he was not to go into any gatherings or big groups' whereas in
      his witness statement he said that he was required to report daily to
      the police stations at both mornings and evenings.  I give weight to
      this inconsistence because if it were true that the appellant had to
      suffer the restrictions of reporting twice daily from 1993, I find
      that he would have mentioned this in his asylum interview."

8. That finding underpins the rest of the Immigration Judge's credibility
   consideration (paragraphs 20-27).  It also reveals a more serious problem
   in the anxious scrutiny (Musisi [1997] Imm AR 250) which she is expected
   to give to asylum claims.  The twice-daily reporting requirement was
   mentioned at the asylum interview, contrary to the Immigration Judge's
   finding, at questions 9, 21, 25, 39, 40, 41, 43, 44 and 47, that is, on
   pages B6, B11-12, B16-17 and B19 of that interview.  It is impossible to
   avoid the conclusion that the Immigration Judge did not read at least six
   pages of the 22-page record of the asylum interview, on which her
   decision on the point was, or should have, been based, and the result was
   an error sufficiently unfair to the appellant to amount to an error of
   law (E & R [2003] EWCA Civ 00049).   We are satisfied that it had a
   substantial effect on her credibility finding, and therefore, the error
   is also material.

   Reconsideration hearing

9. The Tribunal proceeded to hear oral evidence and reconsider the question
   of credibility on the basis of all the written and oral evidence before
   us today. We are entitled to have regard to the previous Immigration
   Judge's determination and in particular, to her account of the
   documentary evidence before her and the oral evidence which the appellant
   then gave.   The appellant gave oral evidence to our Tribunal through the
   Arabic interpreter.

   Appellant's account

10. The following account emerges from the screening interview and the
   asylum interview.  The appellant is illiterate but a devout Muslim.  He
   is single.  The appellant attended school between the ages of 6 and 10
   years old, and then was apprenticed as a carpenter from 1977 onwards. He
   continued to work as a carpenter until he came to the United Kingdom.

11. The appellant's parents are dead, but he has a brother and sister still
   living in Tunisia.  The appellant last saw his siblings immediately
   before coming to the United Kingdom.   The appellant's entire family are
   Muslims, but they did not live in the same village as the appellant did
   and were non-practising Muslims, so they were not harassed. In his asylum
   interview, the appellant said his brother lived with his parents and his
   sister was married and lived in another village.

12. The appellant has never held a passport, as the Government would not
   give him one, but did have an entitlement to a national identity card,
   issued in Tunis in 1975.  When it expired in 1985, the appellant did not
   renew his identity card, because the authorities hassled him.  He was
   able to continue working as a carpenter for a further 20 years without an
   identity card. He was denied a passport because he was accused of being
   associated with religious groups.

13. The appellant said that although Tunisia was a Muslim country, he had
   been persecuted because of his faith and arrested in 1992 (sentenced to
   one year) and 2000 (sentenced to 8 months).  The appellant was not a
   member of any religious group and had not taken part in anti-Government
   activities.  He was suspected and questioned because he attended the
   mosque in Nabil for prayers.

14. In his asylum interview, the appellant said that he had been tortured
   in prison and there were marks on his feet.  The appellant had been
   tortured at the police station for 15 days in a cold wet room and beaten
   with plastic cables.  Although the appellant has been in the United
   Kingdom for two months now, there is neither medical evidence nor
   photographic evidence of the alleged marks, though it appears from the
   asylum interview that he showed the Immigration Officer 'marks on his
   left leg'.

15. In Tunisia, the appellant was comfortably off as a self-employed
   carpenter, plenty of work, and was 'not a spender'.   The appellant saved
   his money and could have afforded passage to the United Kingdom at any
   time after 2005.  The agent he paid to bring him to the United Kingdom
   was introduced by a friend and the appellant paid him the local
   equivalent of $2300 US Dollars. The agent brought him in by boat,
   concealed in a lorry, and then bought him a train ticket from a nearby
   station to London.  The appellant did not know which station, or the
   agent's name.

16. That core account (with two brief additions as set out above) was
   maintained and amplified in the asylum interview.  The appellant
   explained that he was permitted to attend mosque throughout but was
   required to sign on twice a day and asked 'whether I have met any of the
   Islamist groups'.  The accusations, dating back to 1992, were of
   membership of an Islamist group working against the Tunisian Government,
   but the appellant never knew the name of the group.  The police were so
   cautious that they used to follow everyone.  Some other people had also
   been tortured.  The appellant had heard about the Islamist groups from
   others but the appellant did not know them.

17. A lot of those with whom the appellant worked ha d been interrogated or
   captured and in particular, the police were interested in some mature
   people the appellant used to sit and talk with.  The police had never
   specified which group interested them or given any name.  The group was
   not a terrorist group, just acting against the Government, but as the
   appellant had not been involved, the appellant had no idea what acts the
   group took.  The police had no evidence against him.  After his release
   in 2000, the appellant had to 'not go into any gatherings of big groups'
   and also report twice daily.   The same condition had applied after his
   1992 arrest.  The appellant sometimes attended at another mosque.  The
   appellant knew no one who was involved in anti-Government activities.
   There were very many other people in his situation.    The police were
   keeping an eye on several mosques, looking for those who stayed on to
   chat after prayers.

18. In relation to the 2000 detention, the appellant could not explain why
   his second sentence on the same charge was shorter than the first.  The
   appellant said that he was only provided with one meal a day, beaten with
   plastic cables and kicked by the police with metal capped boots.   The
   appellant only had injuries to one leg.  After his release, he went back
   to work and reported as ordered.  They had a book at the police station
   which the appellant had to sign.  Life became impossible; if the
   appellant got a job a bit further out, he could not take it because of
   his commitment to sign on and he had to inform the authorities of any job
   he might take outside the town.  If for any reason the appellant slept
   outside the city, the police would come and arrest him, beat him and
   remind him that he should not go and sleep anywhere else.  There was no
   possibility of signing in another city.  The appellant could not get
   married or settle; it was 'hell and torture' for him.

19. The appellant intended to come to the United Kingdom long before he
   actually achieved it; the problem was not finance but finding a suitable
   agent.  A friend who knew of his misery (and whom he had known for seven
   or eight years without receiving such a recommendation) introduced him to
   an agent, just a week before the appellant came to the UK. The friend
   lived in Tunis City. The appellant paid for the agent's services himself;
   he no longer had his parents to support, only had to provide for himself,
   and he was always in work.   The appellant had no idea which countries he
   passed through en route. The lorry driver had a Tunisian accent.

20. The appellant said that he the authorities' interest in him arose from
   his regular post-prayer discussions with three older men, people he used
   to work with as a carpenter, who had been previously detained and were
   being watched by the police.  They were now all married and settled; the
   appellant did not know what they had done against the Government or the
   name of the group they were involved with.  The police were frightened of
   them because they used to gather at the mosque or at their homes.  They
   never discussed their anti-Government activities with him.  The police
   would ask him who he had sat with and what he had done each day, either
   when he signed on at the police station, or, if they were feeling
   suspicious, by coming to his home at 1 am. It happened so often that the
   appellant lost count.

21. The appellant gave further details in his witness statement.  Most of
   that statement is amplification or repetition, with the following
   apparent variations; in 1992, the appellant was accused of 'being in a
   political movement' and charged with 'conspiracy against the Government'.
    There is no mention of injuries to his feet but the appellant repeats
   his allegation that the appellant has marks on his left shin from
   kicking.  In 1996, the appellant met the three men already mentioned (now
   named as NY, MBH, and LT).  The men told him of the treatment they had
   suffered in detention but not, the appellant said, of their activities.
   They all had carpentry businesses and the appellant often worked for them
   thereafter.  The appellant believed that he had been targeted because he
   was single and frequenting a mosque where people the Tunisian authorities
   suspected also attended.

22. The appellant now confined his allegation that the authorities followed
   everyone to 'those whom they believed to be very religious'.   He
   considered signing on twice each day to constitute surveillance.   The
   appellant had been taken for questioning many times between 1993 and 2000
   but did not regard this as a problem as he was used to it.  Internal
   relocation was not an option because of the signing requirement.

23. As regarded the three men, the appellant now said that as they were now
   all married, the authorities had lost interest in them, but the interest
   in him continued because the appellant was single and still attending the
   mosque of which the authorities had suspicions. The appellant worked in
   the same street as the three men and had last seen them the day before
   leaving for the United Kingdom.  As far as he knew, they were still in
   Tunisia and continuing to conduct post-prayer discussions at the mosque
   without official interference.

24. The appellant repeated that he had approached a police officer to claim
   asylum and only realised afterwards that he had been arrested.  The
   appellant's evidence to the Immigration Judge seems to have been
   consistent with the account above.

   Oral evidence at the reconsideration hearing

25. The Tribunal took further oral evidence from the appellant, who
   confirmed that he had given the names of the three men to the police.
   The appellant understood that they were just telling people how to be a
   good Muslim, but that the authorities were afraid of anyone who was
   religious and tried to recruit others.  The appellant did not know if the
   three men did any more than tell people how to be good Muslims.  He knew
   that they also held meetings outside the mosque which he suspected of
   being more contentious, and had been invited to those meetings, but
   declined.

26. The appellant was able to tell the Tribunal what he thought the
   authorities feared; he considered that their fear was of increased
   involvement by devout Muslims in Jihad or Al Da'wa (the Call) which he
   understood meant calling people back to Islam.    The appellant knew the
   authorities feared him because they thought he did take part in
   activities outside the mosque, but he did not.   The three men were still
   in Tunisia.  They had workshops there, and like him, they had been unable
   to obtain passports.

27. The appellant had begun attending the mosque in 1991, when he was 24.
   He had been drawn to it when he saw how peaceful people looked.   The
   appellant attended the mosque at least daily, sometimes two or three
   times.  The appellant was self-employed and could go when he wanted. The
   appellant had never learned to read and write and although he wanted to
   learn, he had found it was too late for him.  The appellant liked to
   attend groups where the teachings were explained, even large post-prayer
   groups in the mosque.

28. Tunisia was a secular country; women were prohibited from wearing the
   hijab and men from growing beards. The appellant had grown a very small
   amount of facial hair, not really as much as a beard, but after his
   detention the appellant was scared and began shaving again.  In the
   United Kingdom, the appellant had not considered growing a beard; Islam
   was in a person's heart, not his beard.

29. The appellant told us that he had been raised as a Muslim and knew what
   to do or not in the mosque, the basic things.  The appellant said he did
   not know whether family members attended the mosque; the Tribunal put to
   him his interview evidence that his brother Tahar attended the mosque and
   the appellant then said that was different, Tahar lived in a small
   village and there would only be about four people attending that mosque.

30. The police had wanted to know exactly who came to see the three men for
   whom the appellant worked, and what he talked to them about.  If the
   appellant's answers were not satisfactory, the police would beat him.
   The appellant was not questioned every time he went to sign on; he took
   no notice of how long he was questioned and could not say what was the
   longest interrogation he had ever experienced.  It was not his
   understanding that attending a big group at the mosque offended against
   the 'no large gatherings' restriction which formed part of his conditions
   of release.

   Submissions

   Secretary of State's submissions (Dr Smith)

31. We then heard submissions on the oral, written and background
   information before us.  For the Secretary of State, Dr Smith relied upon
   the letter of refusal.  The appellant's evidence as to whether he knew
   anyone involved in anti-Government activities was conflicting; at
   interview the appellant had said, first that he did not, and later, that
   he did.  His evidence to the present Tribunal had been clearer and was
   that the appellant knew that the three men were involved in anti-
   Government activities but had avoided engaging with those activities,
   outside the mosque, while continuing to attend their post-prayer meetings
   and to work for them in their carpentry workshops.

32. His evidence as to family mosque attendance was also contradictory and
   the evidence as a whole, evasive and vague.  If in difficulties, the
   appellant was quick to reiterate that he was a simple man who did not
   understand politics.   The appellant's evidence of the Islamic teachings
   heard daily for almost fourteen years was very vague and was limited to
   generalities about being a good citizen.  Although the appellant had
   never previously been able to name a political group, today the appellant
   had named al-Da'wa without apparent difficulty.

33. It was absurd to suggest that an appellant could be charged twice,
   imprisoned, tortured and questioned as frequently as now alleged over a
   period of fourteen years without the police once mentioning the name of
   the group with which the appellant was said to be connected.  The
   appellant was unable to say how long he was questioned each time, or even
   the longest time, and his answers were implausibly vague on that account
   also.

34. Further, the appellant continued to attend the post-prayer discussions
   despite his conditions of release, for years, without the police taking
   matters further.  The friend who helped him to leave had been known to
   the appellant for eight years and would surely have helped him earlier.
   Dr Smith asked the Tribunal to find that the original Tribunal made a
   material error of law, and to substitute decisions dismissing the appeal
   on both asylum and human rights grounds.

   Appellant's submissions (Ms Sethi)

35. For the appellant, Ms Sethi argued that the appellant's history
   amounted to past persecution (the two charges of activities conspiring
   against the Government in 1992 and 2000).  As an absconder, his fear of
   persecution was even more serious.  The account was simple and consistent
   and she asked that the appellant be found credible.  The Immigration
   Judge had accepted the appellant's evidence that he had tried to claim
   asylum by seeking out a policewoman on the street and been arrested; this
   should not discredit his core account.   His account was consistent with
   the background material, in particular Mr Joffï¿½'s reports.

36.   The appellant's reference in his witness statement to 'our Muslim
   brothers' was to an international grouping.  His reference to al-Da'wa
   was as a religious not political group.  The appellant's rï¿½le with the
   authorities had been more as an informant, giving movements and
   associations of people believed to be part of the movement; informants
   had an important rï¿½le to play.  There was nothing to suggest that the
   appellant regarded himself as prohibited from attending the mosque or its
   post-prayer discussion groups.

37. Ms Sethi referred us to pages 26, 29, 32, 39-40 of the appellant's
   bundle, to pages 4, 5, and 16-17 of Mr Joffï¿½'s report of 10 August 2005
   (served at 8.42 am on the morning of the Immigration Judge hearing) and
   to an email from Mr Joffï¿½ of 15 August 2005 which was attached to the
   application for review.  The police harassment in the form of signing on
   was entirely credible; conditions in prisons were poor, with detainees
   being tortured as the appellant alleged.  Being Muslim was not the
   problem; Tunisia is a Muslim country, but there was a risk to those who
   were devout Muslims and might therefore be seen as Islamists.  It was
   entirely plausible that individuals frequenting the mosque might be seen
   as Islamists and be at risk. There was no necessity to hold the political
   opinion attributed; this was a case of imputed political opinion.

38. Ms Sethi accepted that the Tribunal's finding on Articles 2 and 3 ECHR
   would follow the asylum claim and adopted her arguments under the Refugee
   Convention.  Any suspected association with Islamic fundamentalists,
   specifically those engaged in anti-Government activities, would be
   heightened by being an absconder as this appellant now was.  She asked
   the Tribunal to set aside the Immigration Judge's negative credibility
   finding and allow the appellant's appeal.

39. Ms Sethi also sought s.103D funding.  We return to that application
   below at paragraph 56.

   Mr Joffï¿½'s evidence

40. We considered the evidence of Mr Joffï¿½ tendered in two reports.  The
   Tribunal has on many occasions found Mr Joffï¿½'s reports lacking in
   objectivity.  In GH (Former Kaz - Country Conditions - Effect) Iraq CG
   [2004] UKIAT 00248, the Tribunal heard oral evidence from Mr Joffï¿½ in
   relation to Iraq and found that -

   "75.     We have no reason to doubt that both Dr Rashidian and Mr Joffï¿½
   have considerable knowledge of the countries to which they refer and on a
   factual basis there is much of assistance to us in their respective
   reports. For the reasons which we have set out at some length in the
   preceding paragraphs of this determination, however, we do not consider
   that either of them ought properly to be relied upon as impartial expert
   witnesses in this appeal. We have reached this conclusion because we find
   their reports selective, lacking in objectivity and seeking to promulgate
   opinions on matters which neither reflect a proper appreciation of the
   stated and accepted evidence of the appellant, nor the full range of
   available objective evidence, nor the legal nature of the issues for
   decision in asylum and human rights appeals. Mr Joffï¿½ in particular laid
   great emphasis on the practicability and logistics of return as well as
   misunderstanding the nature of the risk to be demonstrated by asylum
   applicants."

41. We do not have the advantage of oral evidence from Mr Joffï¿½ here.  His
   written report records that he has never met the appellant, but is
   certain that the appellant is not a member of an anti-Government
   organisation and had done nothing wrong -

    'obviously no sophisticate but an artisan who, by his own account knows
   nothing and has no real interest in politics, who has simply been swept
   up into a process of which the appellant knows nothing and over which he
   has no control'.

42. The first two pages of Mr Joffï¿½'s expert report (numbered 3-5 because
   of lengthy recitals of articles produced and so on) consist of criticism
   of the Secretary of State and recital of the appellant's version of
   events.  It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that Mr Joffï¿½ is 'parti-
   pris', that is, that his report lacks objectivity. Pages 5-18 are a
   general treatise with little focus on the appellant's particular account.
    The relevant parts of the report at pages 15 and 18-19 consist of
   extracts from Human Rights Watch and the last two US State Department
   Reports.  It is not clear why, at the bottom of page 19, Mr Joffï¿½ cites
   the US State Department Report when the 2004 report is not in the same
   terms, implying some improvement.  We have been unable to place any
   weight on Mr Joffï¿½'s report and have preferred the original sources.

43. We have also read Mr Joffï¿½'s email sent in support of the review
   application, which is worth quoting in full as it gives a still better
   opportunity to assess his objectivity in his approach to the present
   appeal -

   "I am currently in Australia.  I have to say that what is clear from the
   papers in this case is that Mr Lhoat is an extremely simple man who takes
   no interest in politics at all and who is devout in a way that would mean
   that he would avoid political discussion.  He is a victim of his own
   simplicity and I am not at all surprised that he knows nothing of
   political organisations such as an-Nahda.  The Party has been banned in
   Tunisia for more than fifteen years and people would not talk of it
   because of fear of informers.  He could quite easily never have heard its
   name and only know that political movements of that kind were bad and
   things about which one did not ask.  I can not believe that his
   credibility should be subsumed into the prejudices of the educated for
   whom such knowledge is second-nature.  Having lived in countries like
   Tunisia, I am well aware, as apparently the Immigration Judge is not,
   that the very simple, devout and usually illiterate live in a completely
   different conceptual world from the educated. Surely allowance must be
   made for that and ignorance should not be seen as an indictment?  George
   Joffï¿½"

44. We reminded ourselves that Mr Joffï¿½ had never met the appellant.  His
   certainty as to the appellant's simplicity and lack of interest in
   politics was therefore surprising.  Mr Joffï¿½'s email also suggested that
   he had the case papers for this appellant with him in Australia; however,
   had he either studied them there, or remembered doing so previously, Mr
   Joffï¿½ would have had to take account, as we have done, of the appellant's
   own account that the police had considered it worth questioning him
   regularly about membership of Islamic groups over a period in excess of
   13 years (paragraph 16 above).

   Other background evidence

45. The core background evidence in the appellant's bundle is the 2005
   Amnesty International report on Tunisia, dated 25 may 2005; the US State
   Department Report dated 28 February 2005; and the Human Rights Watch
   report dated 13 January 2005.  All are current and helpful.

46. The Amnesty International report records the release of 79 political
   prisoners, including prisoners of conscience, mostly members or
   sympathisers of an-Nahda (the Renaissance) an unauthorised Islamist
   movement. Those released were nearing the end of their sentences.
   Examples were given of people arrested or sentenced under terrorism
   related laws introduced in December 2003:

        a) Adil Rahali, deported from Ireland, organisation not named in
           summons, arrested, reportedly tortured, trial scheduled for
           February 2005;

        b) Seven young men convicted of membership of a terrorist
           organisation, convicted of possessing of manufacturing
           explosives, theft, using banned websites and holding
           unauthorised meetings, sentenced to 19 years and three months
           (reduced on appeal to 13 years).  One, a minor, had his sentence
           reduced to two years.  many others arrested at the same time
           were released the same month;

        c) 13 students sentenced to terms of between 4 years and 16 years
           and 3 months, plus up to 10 years administrative control on
           terrorism-related charges.  All claimed to have been tortured
           and the decision was under appeal.

47. The US State Department Report records, as the appellant stated, that
   Muslims are in the majority in Tunisia.  The President is
   constitutionally required to be a Muslim.  20 per cent of seats in the
   legislature are reserved for opposition party candidates.  However, The
   Government's human rights record remains poor, with violence regularly
   used against Islamists, activists and dissidents, and torture of
   detainees to elicit confessions, and political prisoners to discourage
   resistance.  Prison conditions are spartan to poor.   More detail is
   given of the sentenced and released prisoners; two of those released were
   former an-Nahda leaders and the releases were part of an annual amnesty.

48. The Human Rights Watch report records sentences of seven years for a Mr
   Zirda, arrested while visiting Tunisia on the basis of a conviction in
   absentia in 1992 for associating abroad with an-Nahda party members (non-
   violent political offences).  The 2003 terror laws allow prosecution even
   of those exercising their right to dissent by peaceful means, but we note
   that the present appellant remained in Tunisia for a further two years
   after their enactment in 2003, without the terror provisions being used
   against him. Sentences of nine and eight months for political offences
   are recorded in relation to lesser offences, which are not
   disproportionate to those alleged by this appellant, and the longer
   sentences relate to conspiring to surf the internet , attempting to
   obtain bomb-making materials and to contact al-Qaeda in Europe.  If the
   appellant's core account were credible, we therefore accept that there
   might be a risk to him on return which would engage the Refugee
   Convention or the ECHR.

   Discussion

49. There was no medical evidence of the alleged torture; we note that it
   would have been possible for the appellant's scars to be examined on 18
   August at Harley Street by Dr Bright, but for some reason that
   examination did not take place and no report was prepared.  We are unable
   to place much weight on the alleged scarring to corroborate or support
   the appellant's torture allegations.  The appellant has chosen not to
   provide any medical evidence or photographs of the scarring on his left
   leg; in any event, we consider that for a man who has been a carpenter
   since he was ten years old, there is more than one possible explanation
   for leg scars.

50. We then considered whether in fact the appellant's account meets the
   low standard required to engage either Convention.  We find that it does
   not.  His account of his involvement with the three men is contradictory;
   at different times, the appellant asserts that he knows nothing about
   their dissent, that he believes they are involved in anti-Government
   activities outside the mosque, that they remain of interest to the
   authorities and that they are of only historical interest as they are now
   mature and married.   His sketchy knowledge of Islam (limited, really, to
   living a good life and being kind to others) is also difficult to credit
   for a man who spent hours studying at a well-known mosque on a daily
   basis for fourteen years; the appellant may not be able to read, but the
   oral method of teaching would surely have imparted more knowledge, over
   such a long period, than he demonstrates.

51. The appellant's account of his police interrogations is simply beyond
   belief.  It is not credible that in fourteen years of interrogations,
   torture and detentions, neither the appellant nor the police ever
   mentioned jihad, al-Da'wa or an-Nahda and we do not believe it, to any
   standard.  The reference to 'our Muslim brethren' appears only in his
   statement prepared by his solicitors, and not in his oral evidence.  The
   appellant had no difficulty in naming al-Da'wa at the Tribunal hearing.
   We take judicial notice of the fact that al-Da'wa is used to describe
   both the call to return to Islam, as this appellant stated, and also a
   pan-Arab terrorist movement with links to al-Qaeda in which the Tunisian
   authorities would have been entirely justified in having a continuing and
   keen interest.  The same dual use applies to the phrase 'our Muslim
   brethren'.

52. The appellant's account of his family's religion was equally confusing.
    On entry, the appellant stated that they all were Muslims and that his
   brother still worshipped at a village mosque.  In oral evidence before
   us, the appellant said that his family brought him up with the basics of
   Islamic observance so that the appellant knew how to conduct himself in a
   mosque.  In his oral evidence to us, he said   that his family was non-
   practising; but at his asylum interview the appellant had said that his
   brother was not in danger because he worshipped at a small village
   mosque.  When that was put to him in oral evidence, the appellant said
   that it hardly counted as only four men would attend that mosque; that
   was not an explanation which satisfied us.  These are important matters
   about which one would expect a consistent account.

53. We also have regard to the appellant's behaviour.  Despite conditions
   which the appellant allegedly regarded as hellish and intolerable, and
   the financial resources to leave, the appellant made no attempt to do so
   for fourteen years.  The appellant was a fully-occupied, self-employed
   carpenter.   When he did decide to leave Tunisia, he spent $2300 on the
   services of an experienced agent who landed him in the United Kingdom,
   bought him a ticket to London but apparently did not tell him where or
   how to claim asylum.

54. We do not consider ourselves bound by the Immigration Judge's
   acceptance of the appellant's account of approaching a policewoman and
   finding himself arrested instead; that rather generous finding falls with
   the rest of the Immigration Judge's credibility assessment and we do not
   consider that a person who travelled an expensive and apparently well-
   organised route to the United Kingdom would have been without
   instructions as to where and how to make his asylum claim.   We therefore
   treat him as a man who did not claim asylum until after he had been
   arrested.

55. In conclusion, we find that the Immigration Judge's error in paragraph
   19 was a material error of law, but having considered credibility for
   ourselves, we have arrived at the same conclusion as did the Immigration
   Judge; that the core account does not stand up to scrutiny and is not
   credible.  We do not need to have recourse to section 8 Asylum and
   Immigration (Treatment of Claimants etc.) Act 2004 to do so, but we
   remind ourselves that his credibility is also to be regarded as damaged
   by statutory presumption in relation to his illegal entry and failure to
   claim asylum until after his arrest.  The appeal will be dismissed on
   asylum and human rights grounds.

   Funding application

56. Ms Sethi also sought a s.103D funding order and Dr Smith indicated that
   if the appellant were successful, he would not oppose a funding order
   (which would require a separate determination).  However, pursuant to
   Community Legal Service (Asylum and Immigration Appeals) Regulations 2005
   rule 4(2), the Tribunal is prohibited from making a section 103D order in
   fast track proceedings.  As the Tribunal has no power to make such an
   order, there is no necessity for any separate funding determination.

      DECISION


      The original Tribunal made a material error of law.
      The following decision is accordingly substituted:

           The appeal is dismissed on asylum grounds
           The appeal is dismissed on human rights grounds




      Signed
        Dated: 27 September 2005
