                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   This is an  appeal  against  a  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    dismissing an appeal by the appellant against the respondent's decision
    made on 15 May 2012 refusing his application for entry clearance  as  a
    family visitor.  Permission to appeal has been granted  by  the  First-
    tier Tribunal.

Background

2.   The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria born on 22 November 1980.  On  27
    April 2012 he applied  for  entry  clearance  to  attend  his  cousin's
    wedding saying that he intended to stay in the UK  for  ten  days.   He
    said that he was both employed and self-employed.  He gave his  present
    work as a site engineer with Telix Technologies and also said  that  he
    had income from various shares and held landed property and  shares  in
    various companies.

3.   When considering the various documents  submitted  in  support  of  the
    application, the respondent noted that although the appellant had  said
    that Telix Technologies was his company, he had failed  to  supply  any
    independent documents to confirm that it was owned by him.  The company
    bank statement failed to show a turnover which would allow him to  draw
    the level of income he had stated.  He  also  noted  that  5.9  million
    Naira (ï¿½23,600) was placed in his bank account on 26  March  2012  four
    days before the generation of that document.  This was in the form of a
    cash deposit and did not indicate its source.  His  own  personal  bank
    statement which apparently showed salary deposits  did  not  correspond
    with any transfers out of the company account.  For these  reasons  the
    respondent was not satisfied that the appellant had shown  sufficiently
    strong family, social or economic  ties  to  Nigeria  or  that  he  had
    sufficient incentive to leave the UK at the end of his proposed visit.

4.   The appellant appealed against that decision and in the  light  of  the
    further documents submitted with the notice of appeal the decision  was
    reviewed.  It was noted that the appellant had said that he was both an
    employee and the owner  of  the  same  company.   In  his  grounds  the
    appellant claimed that, as the company in question was  not  a  limited
    one, the Memorandum of Articles and Association were  not  required  to
    confirm ownership.  However, the respondent said  that  such  documents
    would identify the owners of a business in Nigeria whether  limited  or
    otherwise.  It was noted that the appellant had chosen  not  to  submit
    these documents with his appeal.  It  was  further  asserted  that  the
    respondent had only considered one of the company  bank  accounts  when
    reaching the previous decision.  It was  accepted  that  a  copy  of  a
    company account which did appear to show the salary being paid  to  the
    appellant had been submitted in support of the  appeal  but  it  was  a
    photocopy and in these  circumstances  the  respondent  was  unable  to
    determine whether amendments had been made to it or otherwise to verify
    its authenticity.  The appellant had also  failed  to  explain  why  he
    would be the owner of the company and a salary receiving employee.  The
    officer carrying out the review had tried to  contact  the  appellant's
    sponsor in the UK on several occasions and noted that the  sponsor  had
    been associated with numerous applications all for family visitors.  He
    had  proved  to  be  uncontactable  in  each  case   to   confirm   the
    relationships or the offer to maintain and accommodate the applicants.

The Hearing before the First-tier Tribunal

5.   No application was made for a hearing and the  appeal  was  accordingly
    allocated for a decision on the documentary evidence.  The judge  noted
    the issues which had concerned the  respondent  about  the  appellant's
    financial circumstances and then reminded herself  that  there  was  no
    right of appeal in a visit appeal unless the application was  made  for
    the purpose of visiting a family member  as  defined  in  the  relevant
    regulations.

6.   The judge commented that, although the appellant referred to  attending
    his cousin's wedding and being sponsored by another cousin, no  further
    details were provided.  She referred to the fact that his  sponsor  was
    said to  have  a  history  of  sponsoring  family  visitors  and  being
    uncontactable.  She commented that the term "cousin" was often  loosely
    used and did  not  necessarily  mean  that  there  was  a  close  blood
    relationship and given that the appellant had elected to have  a  paper
    hearing, the sponsor had been unable to give evidence or  resolve  that
    relationship issue.  In the absence of such evidence she found that the
    appellant had failed to show that the relationship was within the range
    of relationships detailed in the  regulations  and  the  appellant  was
    therefore not entitled to a right of appeal.  The appeal was  therefore
    dismissed for want of jurisdiction.

7.   The appellant sought permission to appeal on the basis that  the  issue
    of the relationship was not one of the issues in  dispute  between  the
    parties and that the appellant's notice and grounds of  appeal  against
    the respondent's decision had not been properly considered.

The Grounds of Appeal

8.   Permission to appeal was granted for the following reasons:

         "3...It does seem from the respondent's refusal decision  that  the
            issue of relationship had not been raised.  The judge's decision
            appears to be significantly influenced by the lack  of  evidence
            in respect of the relationship between the appellant and sponsor
            such that she dismissed the  appeal  for  want  of  jurisdiction
            (strictly  as  the  judge  found  that  there  was  a  want   of
            jurisdiction, she should not have gone on to dismiss it  because
            there was no appeal before her).  This matter  came  before  the
            judge as a paper case and as the judge had  concerns  about  the
            relationship it may have been prudent to give the appellant,  in
            the interests of justice, an opportunity to deal with the  issue
            and submit a reply.  Perhaps that is all the more important in a
            paper case where there is no sponsor before the Tribunal.


         4.   Accordingly,  it  may  well  be  argued  that  the  judge  had
            materially erred in law.  However, the appellant  must  bear  in
            mind that the burden of proof rests  on  him  to  establish  the
            relationship with the sponsor."

9.   This appeal was first listed for hearing on  18  June  2013.   At  that
    hearing the Tribunal raised the issue of  whether  there  was  evidence
    beyond the assertion in the decision letter to support  the  contention
    that  the  appellant's  sponsor  had  sponsored  a  number   of   other
    applicants.  The Presenting Officer subsequently made enquiries and  by
    letter dated 18 June 2013 enclosed records in relation to five separate
    applications where this sponsor was identified as sponsoring  a  family
    visit.  It is noted that not one of the applicants  is  the  mother  or
    brother of the appellant but they are all family visitors and  four  of
    the five are said to be coming to attend the wedding of a relative  but
    on different dates and all would appear to have different addresses  in
    Nigeria.  This evidence has been served on the appellant together  with
    the notice of this hearing.  Further evidence has now been received  on
    20 August 2013 in the form of a statement from the sponsor dated 1 July
    2013.

The Error of Law

10.  The first issue I must decide is whether the First-tier Tribunal  erred
    in law by finding that the appellant had failed to show that he and his
    sponsor were related as claimed and in the light of that  finding  that
    there was no right of  appeal  and  therefore  no  valid  appeal.   The
    appellant's application was refused by the respondent on the basis that
    he could not meet the requirements of para 41(i) and (ii), that he  was
    genuinely seeking entry as a visitor and that he intended to  leave  at
    the end of his proposed visit.  No  issue  was  taken  in  the  refusal
    notice on the issue  of  whether  the  appellant  was  related  to  the
    sponsor.  When the decision was reviewed in the light  of  the  further
    evidence submitted with the grounds of appeal an issue was raised about
    the inability  to  contact  the  sponsor  and  the  fact  that  he  was
    associated with a number of applications for family visits and in  each
    case he had proved to be  uncontactable  to  confirm  relationships  or
    offers to maintain and accommodate those he was sponsoring.  I  am  not
    satisfied that these further concerns were sufficient to put  in  issue
    the relationship between the appellant and  the  sponsor  without  that
    being more clearly stated in the review decision which simply said that
    the decision was maintained.

11.  It was open to the First-tier Tribunal  judge  to  take  the  issue  of
    relationship for herself but as it had not been clearly put in issue in
    the decision letter, the judge should  have  given  the  appellant  the
    opportunity of dealing with  that  issue  and  submitting  any  further
    evidence.  In these circumstances, I am satisfied that there has been a
    procedural irregularity causing unfairness and the First-tier  Tribunal
    decision is set aside.

Re-making the Decision

12.  I am satisfied that the proper course is for me to proceed  to  re-make
    the decision on the basis of the documentary evidence.  The decision of
    the First-tier Tribunal was made without a hearing and there  has  been
    no indication from the appellant  that  he  seeks  a  hearing  of  this
    appeal.  He has been served with the notice of hearing  and  there  has
    been no attendance on his behalf or by the sponsor.  The onus is on the
    appellant to show on the balance of probabilities that he can meet  the
    requirements of the rules.
13.  The initial decision made by the  respondent  relied  on  a  number  of
    reasons for finding that the appellant had failed to show  sufficiently
    strong family, social  or  economic  ties  to  Nigeria  to  provide  an
    incentive to return and in particular that  he  had  not  supplied  any
    independent documents confirming that he owned Telix Technologies;  the
    company bank statement failed to show a turnover allowing him  to  draw
    his level of stated income; a deposit of 5.9  million  Naira  had  been
    made on 26 March 2012 four days prior to the generation of the document
    and was a cash deposit not indicating its source  and  the  appellant's
    personal bank statement showed salary deposits not  corresponding  with
    transfers out of the company account.

14.  In his grounds of appeal the appellant  refers  to  the  fact  that  he
    holds a certificate  of  registration  of  the  business  name,  number
    BN2131304, other certificates (containing both his  and  the  business'
    name) were attached to the application and the company profile had been
    filed reflecting the various activities of the company.  On  the  issue
    of the 5.9 million Naira entering the account on 26 March 2012, he said
    that two  company  bank  statements  had  been  submitted  which  taken
    together showed that the company turnover was sufficient  to  meet  the
    overheads including staff salaries and that the company and  pro  forma
    invoices submitted established the source of the sums received.  It  is
    argued that there was  sufficient  evidence  to  show  the  appellant's
    strong family, social and economic ties to Nigeria and that he would be
    supported and maintained by his sponsor for the proposed short trip  to
    the UK.

15.  The appellant has sought to meet the point about  the  payment  of  5.9
    million Naira in to the company account by producing an  invoice  dated
    25 March 2012 to Telestaff Concept which purports to be  authorised  on
    the same day and presumably paid in cash as the payment into  the  bank
    account was in cash the following day.  He also produces  invoices  for
    dates between 2009 and 2012 in very similar form where the approval for
    payment is always on the date of invoice but there is no indication  of
    when or where those sums if received were paid. The appellant fails  to
    satisfy me that these are genuine documents. In the review decision the
    respondent made the point although a certificate of registration of the
    business name had been supplied and the appellant had asserted that the
    Memorandum of Articles and Association  was  not  required  to  confirm
    ownership, those documents do identify the  owners  of  a  business  in
    Nigeria whether limited or otherwise.  The point was also made that the
    copy of the company account submitted was a photocopy and so it was not
    possible to determine if any amendments had been made.

16.  I am not satisfied that it is possible to obtain  a  clear  picture  of
    the appellant's financial position or of the viability or profitability
    of Telix Technologies from the evidence  submitted  or  that  there  is
    sufficient evidence to show on the balance of probabilities  that  this
    is a company genuinely trading which is able to provide  the  appellant
    with his claimed income.

17.  Further concerns arise about this application from the  evidence  about
    the number of previous sponsorships by the  appellant's  sponsor  whose
    statement repeats the assertion that he is related to the appellant and
    will accommodate and maintain him during the  proposed  visit  and  the
    argument that the issue of relationship had not been one of the  issues
    raised  between  the  parties  before  the  appeal  at  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  It says that there has never been any time that he has  been
    contacted in respect of the appellant and that  he  and  his  wife  are
    highly embarrassed by this allegation and refute  the  same  in  strong
    terms.  However, his statement does not deal with the issue of  whether
    he has sponsored other family members.

18.  One of the previous applications it to attend a wedding  in  June  2012
    whereas others relate to an application with a travel date of 1  August
    2012 to attend an uncle's  wedding,  17  September  2012  to  attend  a
    cousin's wedding and 27 September 2012 to attend an uncle's wedding and
    finally for a holiday for three weeks with a travel date of 27  January
    2013.  The addresses given for the sponsor are 99 Old  Road,  the  same
    address as given at box 8.4 on the present application  with  the  same
    telephone numbers.

19.  It may that there are innocent explanations for these sponsorships  but
    nonetheless the onus is on the appellant to show that he can  meet  the
    requirements of the rules and the concerns arising from  this  multiple
    sponsorship confirm the doubts I have about whether the  appellant  has
    given a genuine account of his financial and domestic circumstances  in
    Nigeria and about the purpose and extent of the visit.

20.  In summary, although I am prepared to accept  that  he  is  related  as
    claimed to the sponsor, I am  not  satisfied  that  the  appellant  has
    discharged the onus of showing that a genuine visit  was  intended  for
    the purpose and period stated or that he would leave when his visit was
    concluded.

Decision

21.  The First-tier Tribunal erred in law.  The decision is  set  aside.   I
    re-make the decision by dismissing the appellant's appeal  against  the
    refusal of entry clearance as a family visitor.
