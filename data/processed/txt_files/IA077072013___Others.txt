Representation:
For the Appellants:    Ms G Brown, instructed by Farani-Javid-Taylor
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr C Avery, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The  appellants  are  citizens  of  India  and  the  first  and  second
    appellants are partners and the third appellant is their  son  who  was
    born on 22 May  2004.   They  appealed  against  the  decision  of  the
    respondents to refuse them leave to remain in the United Kingdom  under
    Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.

2.   Their appeal first came before First-tier Tribunal  Judge  O'Garro  and
    in a decision  dated  22  January  2014  he  dismissed  their  appeals.
    Permission to appeal against that decision was  granted  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Astle on 10 February 2014  and  at  the  hearing  before
    Deputy  Upper  Tribunal  Harris  he  found  an  error  of  law  in  the
    determination and remitted the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal for  a
    re-hearing.  The re-hearing was before First-tier Tribunal Judge  Kaler
    who dismissed the appellants' appeal in  a  decision  dated  31  August
    2015.  The appellants appealed against that decision and permission  to
    appeal was refused initially by Judge Pooler, a judge of the First-tier
    Tribunal on 28 January 2016.

3.   Permission to appeal was subsequently granted by Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    Bruce on 23 March 2016 stating that it was arguable that  in  assessing
    whether it was reasonable for the third appellant to  return  to  India
    the First-tier Tribunal erred in its approach.  He stated  that  it  is
    further arguable that he had  failed  to  consider  the  relevant  Home
    Office policy to the effect that strong reasons  will  be  required  to
    refuse leave to a child who had spent more  than  seven  years  in  the
    United Kingdom and referred  to  the  case  of  PD  &  Others  (Article
    conjoined  family  claims)  Sri  Lanka  [2016]  UKUT  00108  which  was
    promulgated after the appeal had been heard.

4.   The First-tier Tribunal Judge  in  dismissing  the  appellants'  appeal
    gave the following reasons.

5.   At the beginning of the determination  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    set out the first appellant's immigration history and  found  that  the
    evidence of the first appellant is not credible because he made a false
    claim for asylum, he did  not  give  his  real  name  when  making  the
    application, he entered the United  Kingdom  unlawfully,  he  has  been
    inconsistent as to when he actually came to the United Kingdom  and  he
    had produced no documents to  establish  his  presence  in  the  United
    Kingdom during the critical period in 2006 when an application was made
    for entry clearance under a false name with his passport.  He  has  not
    produced witnesses who could verify his presence in this country at all
    times in 2006.

6.   The judge found that the  second  appellant  also  entered  the  United
    Kingdom, unlawfully, because she came to the United Kingdom in 2003  as
    a visitor. The judge did not accept her explanation that she  had  come
    here to see the sights of London as a visitor but came here to live  in
    this country. The judge found that the second appellant has a sister in
    the United Kingdom with whom she has been living. The judge found  that
    although the appellants have established family life between themselves
    but have not done so with their other adult relatives in this  country.
    He stated that the have also established private  life  in  the  United
    Kingdom but nevertheless, they do not qualify for leave to remain under
    the provisions of the substantive Immigration Rules  and  Appendix  FM.
    The judge went on to consider case law relevant to  their  appeals  and
    stated that at paragraph 26 that although the first and third appellant
    speak English, the second appellant has a poor  grasp  of  the  English
    language.  The judge found that all three appellants are in the  United
    Kingdom  unlawfully  and  their  immigration  status  has  always  been
    precarious.

7.   The judge found that by virtue of Section  117D  the  appellant  has  a
    qualifying child.  The judge took into account the case of Azimi-Moayed
    & Others (decisions affecting children - onward  appeals)  [2013]  UKUT
    197 (IAC) and stated at paragraph 33 of his decision:

         "What I draw from the above cases is that first and  foremost,  the
         best interests of children lie with  them  being  brought  up  with
         parents who love and care for them.  The third Appellant  has  been
         here since he was 3 years old; he is now  aged  11.   He  does  not
         remember India.  He speaks Punjabi and English.  He  has  completed
         his primary schooling and is due to start secondary school shortly.
          There are excellent schools in India and  he  could  continue  his
         studies there in English or in Punjabi.   English  is  one  of  the
         official languages in India.  He no doubt has friends here  in  the
         United Kingdom but he has already moved to another  school  leaving
         behind his friends in Southall.  He lives with his mother and  aunt
         and is accustomed to being brought up in an Indian  household.   He
         is fit and healthy and does not have special needs.   There  is  no
         evidence before me to suggest that it would be detrimental  to  his
         wellbeing or contrary to his best interests  to  enjoy  family  and
         private life in India with his parents."

    The judge continued that it would be reasonable for the family  to  re-
    establish family life in India.  The judge noted  that  the  appellants
    had relatives in India.  The judge found that the  first  appellant  is
    highly skilled and would have no trouble finding  employment  in  India
    although there might be a short period of re-adjustment  until  he  can
    find a job and home for  his  family.   The  judge  dismissed  all  the
    appeals.

8.   In the renewed grounds of appeal I set out the following  which  is  in
    summary.  It stated that the very fact that First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Kaler has referred to the case of  Azimi-Moayed  does  not  necessarily
    indicate that in the judge's mind that case was afforded proper weight.
     There is more than one proposition that arises out of Azimi-Moayed  as
    set out in the grounds of appeal and  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal's
    determination which is the proposition that a particular application to
    the appellants' case was properly considered and applied.

9.   The Judge best interests' assessment in the decision,  largely  focused
    on the circumstances of  the  third  appellant  should  the  family  be
    returned to India.   Although  the  Judge  was  aware  that  the  third
    appellant had entered the United Kingdom at the age of 3� as stated  at
    paragraph 27 of the determination, it is not reflected that any  proper
    cognisance was given to the fact, as stated,  it  should  be  following
    Azimi-Moayed that the third appellant's seven and a half plus years  in
    the United Kingdom had taken place from an age when the third appellant
    was beginning to develop meaningful social awareness and comprehension.
     This was an important aspect of  the  best  interests'  assessment  as
    concluded in the case of EV (Philippines) v SSHD [2014] EWCA  Civ  874.
    Similarly, there is no indication in the determination  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal that this was applied as it should be.  The  judge  noted
    that the third appellant was due to start secondary school  and  it  is
    not disclosed in the determination that any assessment was made that  a
    further significant disruption and  change  in  the  third  appellant's
    education at this critical stage of secondary school.  It was submitted
    that a finding without evidence that there are  excellent  schools  for
    the third appellant in India does not address the impact  on,  for  the
    third appellant in the terms of the wrench from  his  studies  at  this
    stage of his education and in light of  the  fact  that  the  important
    years of the third appellant's life had been in the United Kingdom.  It
    was submitted that it is an inescapable conclusion  that  on  the  fair
    reading of the determination the Judge's best interests assessment  was
    unduly influenced by the view that the Judge  took  of  the  first  and
    second appellant's immigration history.

10.  When determining the best interests of the child guidance in Zoumbas  v
    SSHD [2013] UKSC 74 and EV  (Philippines)  makes  it  clear  that  such
    considerations had no place in the assessment.   It  is  stated  in  MR
    (permission to appeal, Tribunal  approach)  Brazil  [2015]  UKUT  00029
    (IAC) at paragraph 7 that a reasonable decision is always  required  in
    respect of each and every ground.  Whilst in MR the Tribunal  concluded
    that in determining a permission application the judge was not required
    to embark on unduly, elaborate burdensome analysis, the requirement  in
    Nixon for the main grounds to be addressed was affirmed.

11.  At the hearing I heard submissions from  both  parties  as  to  whether
    there is an error of law in the determination.  Ms Brown on  behalf  of
    the appellants adopted her grounds  of  appeal  including  the  initial
    grounds of appeal.  She emphasised that the judge at paragraph 33  when
    he set out his analysis does not address the correct  issue  which  is,
    "is it reasonable for the child to go back to India with his  parents?"
    She referred to the case of PD and said that the correct approach is at
    paragraph 21 of PD.  She argued that the First-tier Tribunal Judge  had
    not considered the dominant factors which are stated in PD such as  the
    length of the appellant's residence, whether  the  appellant  is  fully
    integrated into this country, his age, the appellant is now 12, and his
    minimal ties to his country of origin.  All  these  factors  should  be
    taken  into  account.   The  judge  considered  the  first  and  second
    appellants appalling immigration history and focused far  too  much  on
    that aspect in her decision.  She referred to  the  judge  who  granted
    permission and who stated that the First-tier Tribunal Judge has  erred
    in the reasonableness requirement.  She referred  to  the  case  of  EV
    (Philippines) as set out in PD at paragraph 24  that  it  is  essential
    that all consideration must focus on the child.  The question is, is it
    reasonable for the child to go back to the country and  not  the  whole
    family.

12.  Mr Avery on  behalf  of  the  respondent  said  that  he  struggles  to
    understand what exactly the judge has  done  wrong.   It  was  entirely
    correct for him to have  considered  the  appellants'  bad  immigration
    history and he considered the reasonableness at paragraphs 33 and 34 of
    relocation of the family to India.  He stated that it  is  quite  clear
    and uncontentious that the right for a child to live with  his  parents
    is perfectly in order as stated by the  judge.   The  judge  considered
    that the third appellant speaks the English language, there are  always
    natural breaks in education just as he left primary school and  started
    secondary school. He submitted that this is no different than the third
    appellant going to different school altogether.  He  further  submitted
    that there are excellent schools in India to which the appellant  could
    go. He stated that The appellant has always  lived  within  the  Indian
    cultural context with his mother and aunt.  He said that the appellants
    appeals were merely a disagreement with the decision of the  Judge  and
    there is no material error of law in the decision.

13.  Ms Brown in reply  emphasised  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge's
    approach was  inconsistent  with  the  law  because  EV  has  now  been
    evaluated and clarified in PD.  She asked me that the question  I  have
    to ask myself in respect  of  paragraph  33  of  the  determination  is
    whether it is in compliance with the relevant law.  She emphasised that
    the judge did not take into account the third  appellant's  integration
    into the United Kingdom such as his roots in this country.  He did  not
    take into account that in the case of Azimi-Moayed it was  stated  that
    any time spent, seven years and plus, is more  relevant  to  a  child's
    integration into a country and the  respondent's  guidance  which  says
    that very strong reasons must prevail before a child who has  lived  in
    this country for more than seven years especially having come  to  this
    country when he was 3� years to now is more  important  and  the  judge
    then followed the policy which is set out in PD in Annex  2  which  she
    referred to me in her arguments that says that the  IDI  say  that  the
    decision maker must consider whether, in the specific circumstances  of
    the case, it would be reasonable to expect the child to live in another
    country and that the decision maker must consider the facts relating to
    each child in the UK, in the family individually and also consider  all
    the facts relating to the family as a whole.  The decision maker should
    also engage with any specific issues explicitly raised by the family by
    each child or on behalf of each child.

My findings as to whether there is an error of law in the decision

14.  The judge in his determination concentrated on  the  first  and  second
    appellants' adverse immigration history from paragraph 1  to  paragraph
    23.  The judge however found that the third appellant was a  qualifying
    child and took into account at paragraph 25 the provisions of  117B  of
    the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, where  it  is  stated
    that where a person has a genuine and subsisting parental  relationship
    with a qualifying child and it would not be reasonable  to  expect  the
    child to leave the United Kingdom. The  test  applied  was  whether  it
    would it not be reasonable to expect the child appellant to  leave  the
    United Kingdom to accompany his parents to India.

15.  The judge then at paragraph 26 of the decision takes into  account  the
    appellants' circumstances and whether they can speak English  and  once
    again talks about the appellants' appalling immigration  history.   The
    judge took  into  account  at  paragraph  32  of  whose  decision,  the
    jurisprudence on the issues before him. He took into account  the  case
    of EM  &  Others  (returnees)  Zimbabwe  [2011]  UKUT  98,  R  (on  the
    application of) Osanwemwenze v SSHD [2014] EWHC and his analysis is  in
    paragraph 33 of the decision which I have already set out above.

16.  I was referred to the IDIs of the respondent at paragraph 11.2.4  which
    state that the decision maker must consider  whether  in  the  specific
    circumstances of the case, it would be reasonable to expect  the  child
    appellant to live in another country.  The IDI state that the appellant
    should look at whether there would be a significant risk to the child's
    health.  The judge found that the third appellant was in  good  health.
    The IDIs also ask whether the child would be leaving the United Kingdom
    with their parents.  The judge found that the appellant would leave the
    country with his parents and his best interests always lies with living
    with his parents. There  is  there  no  dispute  that  a  child's  best
    interests lie in living with their biological parents.

17.  The IDIs also ask that the decision maker look at the extent  of  wider
    family ties in the United Kingdom.  Within the decision the judge found
    that the appellants do not have family life with any  other  person  in
    this country and in the converse they have  family  members  living  in
    India.

18.  The other aspect is whether the child is likely or able to  reintegrate
    readily into life in another country and the relevant factors for these
    are:

    (1)  that whether the parents or child are citizens of the country  and
         so able  to  enjoy  the  full  rights.   It  is  obvious  that  the
         appellants are citizens of India  and  therefore  will  enjoy  full
         rights of nationality of that country.

    (2)  The judge also had to consider whether the  parents  and/or  child
         have lived or visited the country before for periods of more than a
         few weeks and the child would be able to adapt or the parents would
         be able to support the child in adapting to life in that country.

19.  The judge found that the first and second  appellants  of  course  have
    come from India and can easily  adapt  although  there  might  be  some
    difficulty at the beginning.  In respect of the  third  appellant,  the
    judge found that the appellant can, with the help of his parents  adapt
    to life in in India and that there are schools in that country to which
    he can go.

20.  The respondent's IDI's state that the decision maker also  has  to  ask
    the question whether the child has existing family or social ties  with
    the country. The judge noted that the  third  appellant,  has  finished
    primary school and is about to start  secondary  school.  I  find  that
    there is nothing perverse about that conclusion of the judge  that  the
    appellant can go to secondary school in India and would be able to make
    new friends.

21.  The other inquiry to be undertaken is  whether  the  parents  or  child
    have relevant cultural ties with the country to  which  they  will  go.
    The IDI state  that  the  caseworker  must  consider  any  evidence  of
    exposure to, and the level of understanding of the  cultural  norms  of
    the country, for example a period of time spent living  mainly  amongst
    the diaspora of the country may  give  a  child  an  awareness  of  the
    culture of that country.  The judge clearly found in this case that the
    child appellant lives with his mother and aunt in an  Indian  household
    and therefore is fully exposed to the cultural dynamics of his  country
    of his birth.

22.  The judge  also  noted  that  the  first  appellant  speaks  reasonable
    English but the second appellant  has  a  poor  grasp  of  the  English
    language. It is implicit in the determination that the third  appellant
    speaks to his parents in their own language,  he  understands  Punjabi,
    English which is also a language of India.  I find most of the relevant
    considerations have been taken into account by the First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge at paragraph 33.

23.  The judge asks the question "is it reasonable for  the  family  to  re-
    establish family life in India".  It is argued by  Ms  Brown  that  the
    question to have asked is, whether it is reasonable for  the  child  to
    relocate to India with the parents.  In that regard, although the Judge
    has not made a specific reference to whether  strong  reasons  will  be
    needed to ask a child who has lived in this country for seven years  to
    leave the country I find that the judge has considered in his  decision
    all the factors pertinent to the third appellant. It is implicit in the
    judge's decision as it is in EV (Philippines) that the country to which
    the appellants will be  returned  is  a  relevant  consideration.   The
    appellants and the child appellant would return to India which  is  the
    largest democracy in the world.  That is a relevant factor.

24.  Each case is fact sensitive.  I find that the judge who at first  blush
    appeared to have given a lot of emphasis  to  the  adverse  immigration
    history of the first and second appellant has  nevertheless  considered
    all the relevant factors  in  this  appeal  in  respect  of  the  third
    appellant and has come to a sustainable  conclusion.  The  case  of  EV
    (Philippines) makes it quite clear that it was reasonable to expect the
    three children that appeal to continue to live with their  parents  and
    they could all return together to their  country  of  origin  with  the
    public interest and maintenance of firm immigration control prevailing,
    was sustainable in law.  In the language of Lewison LJ, to remain  with
    their parents was obviously in  their  best  interests.  A  differently
    constituted Tribunal would not come to a different decision.

Notice of Decision

25.  I therefore find, in light of the above that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge has not made a material error of law in the determination  and  I
    dismiss the appeal.

No anonymity direction is made.
