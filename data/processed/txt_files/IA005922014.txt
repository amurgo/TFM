                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Somal promulgated on 18th November 2014, following a  hearing  at
    Stoke on 26th November 2014.  In the determination, the  judge  allowed
    the appeal of the Appellant, Miss Chido Janet Chiwome.  The  Respondent
    Secretary  of  State,  subsequently  applied  for,  and  was   granted,
    permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal, and thus the  matter  comes
    before me.

The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a female citizen of Zimbabwe  who  was  born  on  21st
    April 1986.  She appealed against the decision of the Respondent  dated
    12th December 2013 refusing  her  leave  to  remain  in  the  UK  under
    paragraph 276ADE(1) of the Immigration Rules.

The Appellant's Claim

 3. The Appellant's claim as originally made was on the  basis  of  private
    life.  She had entered the UK on  11th  September  2005  on  a  Tier  4
    Student visa to study a biomedical science degree at the University  of
    Bedfordshire.  She was subsequently granted  a  post-study  work  visa.
    She then completed a masters degree at the University  of  Aberdeen  in
    2013.

 4. By the time her claim came to the Tribunal before Judge Somal, however,
    she had met a man by the name of Pius  Hakutangwi,  who  is  a  British
    citizen.   She  met  him  in  2008.   They  entered  into  a   personal
    relationship in June 2011.  They now intend to marry in  a  traditional
    ceremony.  Before the Tribunal she said she  would  marry  in  December
    2014.  She said that there would be a church ceremony in the summer  of
    2015.  Nevertheless, at the time of  her  making  her  application  for
    leave,  the  Appellant  was  clear  that  she  had  not  breached   any
    immigration laws and made her application  before  her  existing  leave
    expired (see paragraph 9).

The Judge's Findings

 5. The judge, by the time that she heard the  evidence  in  the  Tribunal,
    observed how the Appellant had not mentioned the fiancï¿½ when  she  made
    her application in January  2013  because  at  the  time  she  had  not
    introduced him to her family and culturally  it  would  not  have  been
    acceptable to do  so.   She  only  introduced  him  to  the  family  at
    Christmas 2013.  As for Mr Pius Hakutangwi, he gave evidence to say  he
    had lived in the UK for twelve years and was a British citizen, and  he
    graduated from the University of East Anglia  and  was  employed  as  a
    social worker now.  Evidence was also heard from the Appellant's uncle,
    Clement Chizaruru.  He explained that the Appellant  came  to  see  and
    stay with his family once every two  months.   He  explained  that  his
    sister, the mother of the Appellant, died in a car accident and it  had
    been particularly hard on the Appellant because she now had  no  family
    left in Zimbabwe and no house to return to.

 6. The judge went on to record that she found the witnesses, including the
    Appellant herself, to be "honest and credible".   She  found  that  the
    Appellant had been in a genuine and subsisting  relationship  with  her
    partner since 2011.  This was confirmed by all  the  witnesses.   There
    were photographs produced at the hearing.  Second, the judge also  held
    that, "I accept the explanation she gave for not mentioning him in  her
    application, as it would not be culturally acceptable, as she  had  not
    introduced him to her family" (paragraph 13).  Since then, as the judge
    observes, the relationship had developed and "they intend to marry in a
    cultural ceremony in December 2014 at her uncle's house  and  a  church
    wedding in June 2015".  For this reason, the  judge  went  on  to  hold
    that,

         "There are insurmountable obstacles to family life with her partner
         continuing outside the UK, as he is  a  British  citizen,  all  his
         family including his parents and siblings live in the UK, and  they
         have no family and no home to return to in Zimbabwe.  It  would  be
         unreasonable for her to return as she has lived in the UK for  nine
         years and she had no parents or family at home to  return  to  ..."
         (Paragraph 13)

    The judge then went on to look at Article 8 and found that it would not
    be disproportionate to expect the family life to continue with indirect
    contact envisaged from the Sponsor and vice versa.   This  was  a  case
    where the Appellant was now embarking on a close personal  relationship
    with Mr Pius Hakutangwi (see paragraph 14).

 7. The appeal was allowed.

Grounds of Application

 8. The grounds of application state that the judge found that  there  were
    insurmountable obstacles to family life continuing outside the  UK  and
    that the Appellant  meets  the  requirements  of  EX.1.   However,  the
    grounds maintain that the judge had not fully engaged the  requirements
    of the Immigration Rules and EX.1 was not a freestanding  part  of  the
    Rules.  It was also not clear from the determination as to whether  any
    part of E-LTRP had been  satisfied  and  nor  was  it  clear  that  the
    Appellant had met the requirements of GEN 1.2.

 9. On 7th January 2015, permission to appeal was granted.

Submissions

10. At the hearing before me on 17th July  2015,  Mr  Mills,  appearing  on
    behalf of the Respondent Secretary of State, drew my attention  to  the
    fact that the judge had said at  paragraph  13  that,  "she  meets  the
    requirements of EX.1 of Appendix FM".   The  judge  had  also  said  at
    paragraph 14 that Article 8 had been met.  The judge had further  added
    at paragraph 15 that the Human Rights  Convention  had  been  breached.
    However, the judge had been wrong to simply jump directly to EX.1.  The
    application had been made on the basis of private life.  The Respondent
    Secretary of State had never had the chance to assess the nature of the
    relationship between the Appellant and Pius Hakutangwi.  That aspect of
    the application had never been considered.  This was important  because
    the evidence shows that the Appellant and Pius Hakutangwi  could  never
    meet the partner Rules.  They were not married.  But most  importantly,
    they had not been cohabiting at the time of the application, and  there
    was no evidence that they were cohabiting now.  If  one  looks  at  the
    witness statements of the parties  it  is  clear  that  they  were  not
    cohabiting.  Therefore, they could not succeed under the partner Rules.
     Yet, the judge allowed the appeal on this basis.

11. Second, the judge allowed the appeal on the  basis  of  "insurmountable
    obstacles to family life", but it was clear from the  recent  Court  of
    Appeal judgment of Agyarko [2015] EWCA Civ  440,  that  "insurmountable
    obstacles", has a very high standard in the Rules because, as the court
    made clear, it,

         "Clearly imposes a high hurdle to be overcome by an  applicant  for
         leave to remain under the Rules.  The test  is  significantly  more
         demanding than a mere test of whether it  would  be  reasonable  to
         expect the couple to continue their family life outside the  United
         Kingdom." (See paragraph 21)

12. There was nothing here to show that this was nothing more than it being
    deemed by the judge to be no more than unreasonable.  This  is  because
    if one looks at the case of Pius Hakutangwi, he had only  been  granted
    indefinite leave to remain in 2012, and he had only then embarked on  a
    relationship with the Appellant in a matter of a few weeks after  that,
    so that it was entirely feasible for the two of them to return to their
    country and make a viable application from there.

13.  This case was very different from the case of AB (Jamaica) where there
    was a white British citizen gentleman who  had  not  lived  abroad  and
    would have to uproot himself to go and live there.  Third,  as  far  as
    the case of Chikwamba was concerned, the latest Tribunal  determination
    of Chen makes it clear that a temporary  separation  of  an  individual
    does not bring the matter within the "Chikwamba Rules": see Chen [2015]
    UKUT 00189.  What was noteworthy about Chikwamba was that the Appellant
    had satisfied the substantive Rules  and  the  only  requirement  there
    additionally was for him to meet the entry  clearance  requirements  by
    returning abroad in order to make an entry clearance  application.   In
    this case the Appellant had not satisfied the substantive Rules and  so
    there was no question of an additional requirement being  imposed  upon
    her.

14. For herself, Ms Dastani drew my attention to her skeleton argument  and
    submitted that there were three essential grounds  being  raised  here.
    First, paragraph 276ADE.  What  was  important  to  look  at  here  was
    paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) which refers  to  there  being  no  significant
    obstacles.  Second, there is a question of Appendix FM and EX.1 and the
    Rules at E-LTRP.  Third, there was Article 8 outside the Rules.  If one
    looked  at  these  three  aspects,  it  was  clear  from  the   judge's
    conclusions at paragraphs 15 to 17 that she was not basing the decision
    on EX.1 (although this  had  been  discussed  earlier).   Moreover,  at
    paragraphs 13 to 14, the judge had set out the evidence that was in the
    Appellant's favour.  Finally, as far as Article 8 was concerned, it was
    plain that she had found there to be  exceptional  circumstances,  such
    that the appeal could be allowed on this basis.

15. In reply, Mr Mills submitted that the fact was that it  was  not  clear
    that the judge was allowing the appeal on areas other  than  EX.1.   It
    was not clear what was meant by  the  judge  when  she  said  that  the
    decision was not in accordance with the law.  It  was  not  clear  that
    paragraph 276ADE had actually been decided upon by  the  judge.   These
    were all matters that led to the decision being one that amounted to an
    error of law.

16. Following the Court of Appeal's decision in Agyarko & Ors,  R  (on  the
    application of) v The Secretary of State for the Home Department [2015]
    EWCA Civ 440 (06 May 2015),  it is clear that it is no longer  feasible
    to  describe  a  case  such  as  the  present  as  one  which  involves
    "insurmountable obstacles" to the continuance  of  family  life.   "The
    phrase 'insurmountable obstacles' as used  in  this  paragraph  of  the
    Rules clearly imposes a high hurdle to be overcome by an applicant  for
    leave to remain  under  the  Rules.  The  test  is  significantly  more
    demanding than a mere test of whether it would be reasonable to  expect
    a couple to continue their family life outside the United Kingdom." (at
    para 21). The Court continued that "The mere facts that Mr Benette is a
    British citizen, has lived all his life in the United Kingdom and has a
    job here - and hence might find it difficult and might be reluctant  to
    re-locate to Ghana to continue their family  life  there  -  could  not
    constitute insurmountable obstacles to his doing so." (para 25).

17. In the instant case, in point of fact, the very question of there being
    "family life" is questionable on the facts of this  case.   This  is  a
    case where the Appellant and her named partner were not living together
    at the time of the decision by the judge.  There is  no  evidence  that
    they are living together now.   Indeed,  they  are  not  married.   The
    Appellant explained that the intention was to marry last year  but  her
    mother passed away and the general family practice is to  wait  a  year
    before any festivities are embarked upon after a bereavement such as  a
    death in the family.  Even so,  the  Appellant's  partner  was  not  in
    attendance at court even today,  and  as  far  as  the  situation  that
    appertained at the time of the judge's decision  is  concerned,  it  is
    clear that two possibilities existed.

18. First, the parties were not, as  I  have  indicated,  living  together.
    That being so, it was entirely feasible for  the  Appellant  to  return
    back to her country and to make an application to re-enter on a  proper
    basis.  Second, even if that was not practicable, it  would  have  been
    entirely reasonable for the Appellant's partner to accompany her  given
    that he had not been settled in the UK  for  very  long  and  had  only
    recently acquired his status.  These matters are  fully  in  accordance
    with the Grand Chamber decision in Jeunesse v the Netherlands where the
    European Court explained that the test that "insurmountable  obstacles"
    involves a stringent test.  There the court held  that  there  were  no
    insurmountable obstacles to  the  family  settling  in  Suriname,  even
    though the Appellant and the family would experience hardship if forced
    to do so.

19. Second, there is the  question  of  the  "Chikwamba  principles"  being
    applied here.  As the case of Chen now makes clear,  Appendix  FM  does
    not  include  consideration  of  the  question  whether  it  would   be
    disproportionate to expect an individual to return to his home  country
    to make an entry clearance application to rejoin family members in  the
    UK.  In all cases, it will be for the individual to  place  before  the
    Secretary of State evidence  that  even  a  temporary  separation  will
    interfere disproportionately with protected rights.   It  will  not  be
    enough to rely solely upon the case law governing Chikwamba.   In  this
    case, no such evidence  has  been  effectively  presented.   Even  more
    importantly, as Mr Mills suggested, Chikwamba  was  a  case  where  the
    former Rules had been complied with substantively and there was  simply
    a requirement that entry clearance be  acquired.   In  this  case,  the
    Appellant does not satisfy the formal substantive Rules that  apply  to
    her  and  it  cannot  be  said  that  she  simply  fails  for  want  of
    satisfaction of an  additional  requirement  imposed  in  a  Kafkaesque
    manner.

Remaking the Decision

20. I have remade the decision on the basis of the findings of the original
    judge, the evidence before her, and the submissions I have heard today.
     For the reasons that I have given above, I am dismissing this  appeal.
    The Appellant cannot  succeed  because  there  are  no  "insurmountable
    obstacles"  to  her  returning  back  to  her  country  and  making  an
    application from there.  She cannot  succeed  also  on  the  "Chikwamba
    principles" given the Tribunal decision in Chen.

Notice of Decision

21. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    of law such that it falls to be set aside.  I set aside the decision of
    the original judge.  I remake the decision as follows.  This appeal  is
    dismissed.

22. No anonymity order is made.
