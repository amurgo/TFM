Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr. P. Armstrong, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr. B. Halligan of Counsel


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State  against  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Cohen, promulgated on 22 July 2016, in  which
    he allowed the appeal of Mr. Tariq against the decision  of  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer to refuse leave to enter as the spouse of  a  British
    citizen.


 2. For the purposes of this appeal I refer to the Entry Clearance  Officer
    as the Respondent, and to Mr. Tariq as the Appellant, reflecting  their
    positions as they were before the First-tier Tribunal.


 3. Permission to appeal was granted as follows:


         "It is arguable that the Judge has misdirected himself in  law  (a)
         by considering third party support by way of an aunt which  is  not
         permitted under paragraph 1B(iii) of  Appendix  FM-SE  and  (b)  by
         stating that paragraph EX.1 was not considered  by  the  Respondent
         when this paragraph only applied to leave to remain  applications."




 4. The Sponsor attended the hearing.  I heard brief submissions  following
    which I announced that I found the decision contained an error  of  law
    and I set it aside to be remade.


Submissions


 5. Mr. Armstrong stated that he had discussed the case with  Mr.  Halligan
    prior to the hearing.  It had been accepted that the decision  involved
    the making of a material error of law as it was not open to  the  judge
    to consider third party support.  Further it was accepted that it was a
    misdirection of law to consider paragraph EX.1, which only  applied  to
    leave to remain applications and not to entry clearance applications.


 6. It was submitted that, although the appeal had also been allowed  under
    Article 8 outside the immigration rules, this finding was infected with
    errors as the judge had erroneously found that the  Appellant  met  the
    requirements of the immigration rules.


 7. The representatives were agreed that  the  only  issue  before  me  was
    whether or not the appeal should be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal
    to be remade.  Mr. Halligan accepted that the findings of fact  as  set
    out in the decision could stand.  It was accepted  that  the  Appellant
    did not meet the requirements of the immigration rules, and so was only
    a  matter  of  remaking  the  decision  under  Article  8  outside  the
    immigration rules.


Error of law decision


 8. I find that in paragraph 19 the judge has  erroneously  considered  the
    third party support from the Appellant's aunt, also the Sponsor's aunt.
     Given that the immigration rules do not allow third party  support  to
    be considered under Appendix FM-SE(1)(b)(iii), the fact that the  judge
    has considered this amounts to a material error of law.


 9. In paragraph 17 the judge criticised the Entry  Clearance  Officer  for
    failing to consider paragraph EX.1.  However,  I  find  that  paragraph
    EX.1 has  no  application  to  entry  clearance  applications,  and  to
    consider it amounts to a material error of law.


10. I therefore set the decision aside.  However, as stated above,  and  as
    agreed at the hearing, the findings of fact are preserved.


Remaking


Immigration rules


11. It was accepted that the Appellant cannot meet the requirements of  the
    immigration rules.


Article 8 outside the immigration rules


12. The Entry Clearance Officer stated in the notice of  decision  that  he
    did not consider that there were any  exceptional  circumstances  which
    would warrant a grant of entry clearance outside the immigration rules.
     He accepted that the decision may result  in  a  limited  interference
    with the right to family life.   The Entry  Clearance  Manager  in  the
    review  dated  11  August  2015  considered  that  the   decision   was
    proportionate.


13. I have considered the Appellant's application under Article  8  outside
    the immigration rules in accordance with the case of Razgar [2004] UKHL
    27.  I find that the Appellant and Sponsor are married, and I find that
    the Appellant has a family life with the Sponsor sufficient  to  engage
    the operation of Article 8.  As accepted by the Respondent, I find that
    the decision is an interference with this family life.


14. Continuing the steps set out  in  Razgar,  I  find  that  the  proposed
    interference would be in accordance with the law, as  being  a  regular
    immigration decision taken by UKBA in accordance with  the  immigration
    rules.  In terms of proportionality, the Tribunal has to strike a  fair
    balance between the rights of the individual and the interests  of  the
    community.  The public interest in this case  is  the  preservation  of
    orderly and fair immigration control in the interests of all  citizens.
    Maintaining the integrity of the immigration rules is self-evidently  a
    very important public interest.  In practice, this will  usually  trump
    the  qualified  rights  of  the  individual,  unless   the   level   of
    interference is very significant.  I find that in this case, the  level
    of  interference  would  be  significant  and  that  it  would  not  be
    proportionate.


15. In assessing the public interest I have taken into account  section  19
    of the Immigration Act 2014 which inserted a new section 117B into  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  Section 117B(1) provides
    that the maintenance of effective immigration controls is in the public
    interest.  The application was  not  refused  on  the  basis  that  the
    Appellant did not meet the English language requirements,  and  I  find
    that he speaks English (section 117B(2)).


16. In relation to section 117B(3), the  application  was  refused  as  the
    Respondent was not satisfied  that  the  Appellant  met  the  financial
    requirements of the immigration rules.  This has been accepted  by  the
    Appellant.  I  have  considered  the  financial  circumstances  of  the
    Sponsor.  I find that she is in receipt of Disability Living  Allowance
    and Employment Support Allowance, and  that  she  receives  �99.90  per
    week.  At the time of the application, the  required  level  of  income
    support for a couple was �113.70.  I therefore find that the Sponsor's
    income was some �14  short  per  week  of  the  required  amount.   The
    Appellant's and Sponsor's aunt has stated that she  would  provide  any
    additional support required (see paragraph 19 of the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal).


17. While for the purposes of the immigration  rules  third  party  support
    cannot be taken into account, I find that the Appellant was  only  some
    �14 short of the financial requirements.  As the Appellant is  fit  and
    healthy, there is no reason that he cannot work when he  comes  to  the
    United Kingdom.  I also take into account the fact that  the  Appellant
    and Sponsor will receive support,  including  financial  support,  from
    relatives in the United Kingdom.  I find that  the  Appellant  will  be
    accommodated by his aunt.


18. Sections 117B(4) to (6) are not relevant.


19. I have considered the Sponsor's circumstances, and whether it would  be
    possible for her to move to Pakistan in order to enjoy family life with
    the Appellant.  I have taken into account the findings  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge set out in paragraph  18  of  the  decision.   This
    refers to the evidence which was placed before the First-tier Tribunal.
     I have considered these documents themselves, as well as  the  summary
    in the decision.


20. I find that the Sponsor has learning  difficulties  and  receives  help
    from Hounslow Community Learning Disability Team.  I find that, due  to
    her cognitive impairment, she requires help with many  aspects  of  her
    day-to-day living, and would need ongoing help to  support  her  health
    and wellbeing.  The evidence provided shows that the Sponsor attended a
    special school from four to 16 years of age.  The judge states that the
    Sponsor appeared vulnerable before him, and it was indicated  that  she
    did not go out unaccompanied (see paragraph 18).  At the hearing before
    me she was accompanied.  I find that when she visited the Appellant  in
    Pakistan she was accompanied by family members (see paragraph 18).


21. I have considered the witness statement from the Sponsor's aunt  (pages
    2 to 5 of the Appellant's bundle).  She states  that  the  Sponsor  has
    severe  learning  difficulties  and  needs  constant  supervision   and
    support.  She is in receipt of ESA indicating that  she  is  unable  to
    work at the current time.  In paragraph 12 of her  statement  she  says
    that the Sponsor has resided in the United  Kingdom  since  her  birth.
    She states that the Sponsor would face discrimination in  Pakistan  due
    to her disability and  that  the  benefits,  support  and  welfare  she
    receives in the United  Kingdom  would  not  be  available  to  her  in
    Pakistan.  It states that she needs her family around  her,  which  she
    has in the United Kingdom.


22. Although his consideration of paragraph EX.1 was otiose, it was  agreed
    by both representatives that the finding  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge that there were insurmountable obstacles preventing  the  Sponsor
    from enjoying family life with the Appellant in Pakistan was a  finding
    that stood, and which I could take into account.  I find on the balance
    of probabilities, taking into account  my  findings  above  as  to  the
    Sponsor's health needs, that she would  not  be  able  to  relocate  to
    Pakistan to enjoy family life with the Appellant there.


23. I find that the health needs  of  the  Sponsor  constitute  exceptional
    circumstances.  I find on the balance of probabilities that the Sponsor
    would not receive the same support and assistance in  Pakistan,  either
    from family members, or from the authorities, to assist with her severe
    learning difficulties.  She is entitled to these benefits  and  support
    from the authorities as a result of being a British  citizen.   I  find
    that she needs this support in order to maintain her  quality  of  life
    and her health.


24. I find that, owing to the Sponsor's particular needs, it would  not  be
    possible for the  Sponsor  and  the  Appellant  to  enjoy  family  life
    together in Pakistan.  Taking into account the particular circumstances
    of this case and the compelling circumstances surrounding  the  medical
    needs of the Sponsor, I find that the balance comes down in  favour  of
    the Appellant.  I find, on  the  balance  of  probabilities,  that  the
    decision is a breach of the  Appellant's  and  Sponsor's  rights  to  a
    family life under Article 8 ECHR.


Notice of Decision


25. The decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the  making  of  a
    material error of law and I set the decision aside.   The  findings  of
    fact are preserved.


26. I remake the decision allowing the Appellant's appeal on  human  rights
    grounds, Article 8.


27. No anonymity direction is made.
