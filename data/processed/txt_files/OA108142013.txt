    Representation:

                            For the Appellant: Mr S Kandola a Senior
           Home Office Presenting Officer
          For the Respondent: the respondent did not appear and was not
represented

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. The appellant is the Entry Clearance Officer in New Delhi ("the  Entry
      Clearance Officer"). The respondent is a citizen of India who was born
      on 25 March 1981 ("the claimant"). The  Entry  Clearance  Officer  has
      been given  permission  to  appeal  the  determination  of  First-Tier
      Tribunal Judge Talbot ("the FTTJ") who allowed the  claimant's  appeal
      against the Entry Clearance Officer's decision of  15  April  2013  to
      refuse him entry clearance to the UK as the wife of his sponsor Mrs  D
      T Bhutia.


   2. The Entry  Clearance  Officer  refused  the  application  because  the
      claimant had not established, by the required means, that the  sponsor
      had the necessary income of at least �18,600 per  annum.  The  sponsor
      had claimed to earn in excess of this amount from  two  jobs.  It  was
      accepted that she had established an income of �13,000 per annum  from
      the first of these but the second, from a company called Wok  to  Work
      where  she  claimed  an  income  of  �550  per  month,  had  not  been
      established because only very poor quality photocopy payslips had been
      supplied and there were no  matching  salary  deposits  shown  in  the
      sponsor's bank account.


   3. The claimant appealed and the decision was  maintained  by  the  Entry
      Clearance Manager. The appeal came before  the  FTTJ  on  24  February
      2014. Both parties were represented and the sponsor gave evidence.  On
      the balance of probabilities the FTTJ  found  that  the  poor  quality
      photocopy  payslips  were  in  fact  the  originals  provided  by  her
      employer. Whilst the personal bank statements did not show receipt  of
      the whole of every salary payment from Wok to Work the  FTTJ  accepted
      the sponsor's evidence that prior to the date of the application  this
      salary was paid in  cash  and  that  identifiable  payments  into  the
      personal bank account were cash payments in made by the  sponsor  from
      her salary and that these reflected, not wholly but to  a  substantial
      degree, the cash she received from this employment.


   4. The FTTJ found that this evidence was sufficient to establish that the
      claimant met the financial requirements of the Rules  and  he  allowed
      the appeal.


   5. The Entry Clearance Officer applied for and was granted permission  to
      appeal arguing that the FTTJ erred in law  by  not  having  sufficient
      regard to the precise requirements of the Rules and that the  claimant
      had failed to comply with these. The FTTJ had not made clear the  date
      at which the evidence was being considered which should have been  the
      date of the application.


   6. Since permission to appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal  was  granted  the
      claimant's solicitors have sent a letter dated  8  July  2014  stating
      that he is withdrawing his appeal and that the  sponsor  will  not  be
      attending the hearing. The Upper Tribunal responded stating  that  the
      appeal could not be withdrawn because the Entry Clearance Officer  had
      been granted permission to appeal against the  decision  of  the  FTTJ
      allowing the claimant's appeal.


   7. The court clerk telephoned the  claimant's  solicitors  who  confirmed
      that this was the position and that neither they nor the sponsor would
      be attending.  Mr  Kandola  spoke  to  the  claimant's  solicitor  who
      informed him that the claimant was not resisting the  Entry  Clearance
      Officer's appeal. It may  be  that  the  claimant  has  made  a  fresh
      application but this has not been confirmed.


   8. I find that the FTTJ erred in law. On the evidence it was not open  to
      him to conclude that the claimant  satisfied  the  detailed  financial
      requirements set out in the Rules. The sponsors pay from Wok  to  Work
      had not been paid into her personal  bank  account  for  the  relevant
      period prior to the date of the application on 24 January  2013  which
      was either a period of 12 months or a lesser period  if  she  had  not
      been employed with this employer for 12 months. It  was  difficult  to
      identify the precise qualifying period in the absence  of  any  letter
      from this employer setting out the period of the sponsor's  employment
      and when it commenced. Furthermore,  the  Lloyds  Bank  personal  bank
      statements submitted did not cover the required period. They covered a
      period from 10 July 2013 to 5 February 2014 but should have covered  a
      period of 12 months preceding the date of the application. Finally, it
      was not open to the  judge  to  conclude  that  the  post  application
      payslips from this employer which had been produced provided  adequate
      evidence of pre-application pay.


   9. Having found that the FTTJ erred in law I set aside the decision.  The
      claimant does not oppose this. I remake the decision and  dismiss  the
      claimant's appeal for the reasons I have given.
