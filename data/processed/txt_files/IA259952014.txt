                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. Pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 (SI 2008/2698) I make  an  order  prohibiting  the  disclosure  or
    publication of any matter likely to  lead  members  of  the  public  to
    identify the appellant. Breach of this  order  can  be  punished  as  a
    contempt of court.

 2. The appellant appeals against the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    dismissing the appellant's  appeal  on  immigration  and  human  rights
    grounds against a decision taken on 4 June  2014  to  refuse  to  grant
    further leave to remain.



Introduction

 3. The appellant is a citizen of Jamaica born in 1962. She entered the  UK
    on 24 June 2002 as a visitor and overstayed when her leave  expired  on
    24 July 2002. She formed a relationship with AS who had resided in  the
    UK for many years but never held a British passport. He died of a heart
    attack in July 2005 and their daughter, SC,  was  born  in  the  UK  in
    February 2006. The family of AS refused to help SC after he  died.  The
    appellant first applied to regularise her stay  in  November  2008  but
    that was refused in January 2009. A further  application  was  made  in
    July 2010 which was initially refused in September 2010. The respondent
    decided to reconsider the decision on 27 January 2012 and  IS151  forms
    were then served on 11 April 2015. Further representations  made  on  2
    May 2014 were treated as a fresh application  and  the  decision  under
    appeal was made on 4 June 2014.

 4.  The  respondent  considered  that  the  appellant  did  not  meet  the
    requirements of paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration Rules ("the Rules")
    and had spent the majority of her life in Jamaica before coming to  the
    UK. SC was 8 and of an age where she could return to Jamaica  with  the
    appellant, having not yet started secondary school. She  would  benefit
    from growing up in a country  where  she  held  nationality  and  could
    become immersed in their culture and customs at a very young  age.  The
    appellant had been receiving �150  per  month  support  from  EW  (SC's
    godfather) and that support could continue.


The Appeal

 5. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal and attended an  oral
    hearing at Hatton Cross on 14 July 2015.  She  was  represented  by  Ms
    Osazuwa, a Solicitor. The judge found that SC was  attending  SS  Peter
    and Paul Primary School, having started there in  September  2010.  She
    was a child under 18 who had lived continuously in the UK for at  least
    7 years.

 6. The question under Appendix FM was whether it was reasonable to  expect
    SC to leave the UK. There  was  nothing  in  the  school  reports  that
    suggested that SC had any special educational  needs  or  required  the
    assistance of a counsellor or educational psychologist.  The  appellant
    had taken no steps to obtain assistance for her after the death of  her
    father. No information had been provided about the cost of schooling in
    Jamaica.

 7.  The  appellant  had  worked  for  many  years  in  Jamaica   and   had
    qualifications as a secretary. She  could  work  in  Jamaica.  She  had
    family in the USA (her mother and two adult children) but had not asked
    them for help, preferring to rely upon support from the  UK  state.  EW
    could continue his support if the appellant and SC went to Jamaica. The
    judge accepted that long residence had led to SC developing ties in the
    UK. SC could apply for UK citizenship when she was  10  but  was  still
    only 9. It was not unreasonable to expect her to leave the UK.

 8. The judge found that the appellant could not meet the  requirements  of
    paragraph 276ADE of the Rules because she had not lived in the  UK  for
    20 years and had not lost ties with Jamaica. She had lived there  until
    she was 40. There was no documentary evidence that her sons  now  lived
    in New York.

 9. The judge then went on to consider Article 8 and the best interests  of
    the child. The appellant had a poor immigration history  and  had  used
    the services of the UK without making any financial  contribution.  She
    received �130.40 every fortnight in subsistence and  rent  since  2012.
    Jamaica would be a strange country to SC and she had friends in the UK.
    However, she was just 8 and could readjust to life in Jamaica.  It  was
    not in her best interests to remain in the  UK.  It  was  in  her  best
    interests to remain with her mother in Jamaica where she could continue
    her family life. Any interference in her private and  family  life  was
    not disproportionate.


The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

10. The appellant sought permission to appeal on the basis that  the  judge
    failed to give adequate weight to the age of the  child  and  the  fact
    that she could apply for UK citizenship  at  her  next  birthday,  made
    speculative findings about the ability of  the  appellant  to  maintain
    herself and SC, erred in drawing an adverse inference from  receipt  of
    public funds, erred in finding that the appellant's  sons  in  the  USA
    could support her, erred in that the  appellant's  immigration  history
    should not count against SC and erred in finding at paragraph 93 of the
    decision that SC was just 8 (actually 9 years 4 months as at  the  date
    of hearing).

11. Permission to appeal was granted by Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Mahmood
    on 27 January 2016 on the basis that it was  arguable  that  the  judge
    made a mistake about SC's age and the fact that  SC  was  so  close  to
    becoming  British  was  a  highly  relevant  and  weighty  matter  when
    considering her best interests. All grounds were arguable.

12. In a rule 24 response dated 9 February 2016, the respondent  sought  to
    uphold the judge's decision  on  the  basis  that  the  judge  directed
    himself appropriately. The judge had given due and proper consideration
    to the best interests of the child and  considered  the  relevant  case
    law. The error of one year of the child's age did not detract from  the
    reasoned and sustainable findings of  the  judge.  The  grounds  merely
    disagreed with the adverse outcome of the appeal.

13. Thus, the appeal came before me.


Discussion

14. Mr Sesay submitted that the judge did not engage with the evidence. The
    reality was that the  appellant  would  be  destitute  upon  return  to
    Jamaica. The judge has not explained  the  findings  to  the  contrary.
    There was no separate  consideration  of  the  best  interests  of  the
    daughter.

15. Mr Kotas submitted that the point at paragraph 92 of  the  decision  is
    that the appellant stated in her application that she was never reliant
    on public funds. The grounds of appeal failed to acknowledge  that  the
    burden of proof was upon the appellant. The findings were rational  and
    properly open to the judge. The error as to age was made  at  paragraph
    88. The age was stated correctly elsewhere and SC will not be 10  until
    February 2016. As at the date of hearing SC  was  7  months  away  from
    applying for UK citizenship. The Tribunal cannot keep looking into  the
    future - that issue could be addressed in  a  future  application.  The
    immigration status of parents  is  the  background  against  which  the
    assessment is made. The judge was well aware of the law and the  facts.
    The grounds are just a disagreement.

16. Mr Sesay submitted in reply that paragraph 58  of  EV  Phillippines  is
    inconsistent with paragraphs 42-44 of ZH Tanzania. The judge  here  has
    conflated the best interests of SC in paragraphs 15, 18, 45, 73, 74 and
    84 of the decision. The judge's findings should be evidence based.  The
    appeal should be allowed and the decision remade in the Upper Tribunal.
    However, Mr Sesay did agree that further findings of fact were required
    from paragraphs 79-85 of the decision.



17. I find that the issue  of  proportionality  involves  striking  a  fair
    balance between the rights of the appellants and the  public  interest.
    In assessing proportionality, the "best interests" of any children must
    be a primary consideration (see ZH (Tanzania) v SSHD (2011) UKSC 4  and
    section 55 of the  Borders,  Citizenship  and  Immigration  Act  2009).
    Whilst  the  best  interests  of  the   child   are   not   necessarily
    determinative, a child's best interests are  a  weighty  consideration,
    albeit one that can  be  outweighed  by  sufficient  weight  of  public
    interest concerns (see ZH (Tanzania) per Lady Hale at [33]).


18. The judge did not consider the 2002 Act in this decision  although  the
    same test of reasonableness features in Appendix FM (leave to remain as
    a parent) of the  Rules  and  that  was  considered  by  the  judge.  A
    significant issue in this appeal is the fact that SC  is  a  qualifying
    child, as defined in section 117D and therefore  falls  within  section
    117B(6) of the 2002 Act. The judge  had  to  consider  whether  it  was
    reasonable to expect her to leave the United Kingdom. The  recent  case
    law remains relevant, whilst taking into  account  that  the  case  law
    effectively pre-dates the commencement of sections 117A -  D  (28  July
    2014).


19. In EV (Philippines) and others v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 874, Lord Justice
    Clarke held that  in  determining  whether  the  need  for  immigration
    control outweighs the best interests of the children, it  is  necessary
    to determine the relative strength of the  factors  which  make  it  in
    their best interests to remain here and also to  take  account  of  any
    factors that point the other way. A decision will depend on a number of
    factors such as the children's age, the length of time  in  the  United
    Kingdom, how long  they  have  been  in  education,  what  stage  their
    education has reached, the extent to which they have  become  distanced
    from the country  to  which  it  is  proposed  that  they  return,  how
    renewable their connection may  be,  to  what  extent  they  will  have
    linguistic, medical or other difficulties in adapting to life  in  that
    country and the extent to which the course proposed will interfere with
    their family life or  their  rights  (if  they  have  any)  as  British
    citizens.

20. In  Azimi-Moayed  and  others  (decisions  affecting  children;  onward
    appeals) [2013] UKUT 00197(IAC),  Mr  Justice  Blake  held  that  as  a
    starting point, it is in the best interests of children to be with both
    their parents and if both parents are being removed from  the  UK  then
    the starting point suggests that so should dependent children who  form
    part of their household unless there are reasons to the contrary. It is
    generally in the interests of  children  to  have  both  stability  and
    continuity of social and  educational  provision  and  the  benefit  of
    growing up in the cultural norms of the society to which  they  belong.
    Lengthy residence in a country other than the state of origin can  lead
    to development of social, cultural and educational ties that  it  would
    be inappropriate to disrupt in the absence of compelling reasons to the
    contrary. What amounts to lengthy residence is not clear cut  but  past
    and present policies have identified seven years as a relevant  period.
    Seven years from age four is likely to be more significant to  a  child
    than the first seven years of life. Very young children are focussed on
    their parents rather than their peers and are adaptable.

21. The difficulty with the decision in this appeal is that the judge found
    that it was in the best interests of SC to return to Jamaica  with  the
    appellant but then appears to have become confused about her age during
    the decision. At paragraph 4  of  the  decision,  the  judge  correctly
    stated SC's date of birth. At paragraph 88, the judge correctly  stated
    that SC was 9 as at the date of hearing. However, at paragraph  93  the
    judge found that SC was now just 8 and was "of an  age  where  she  can
    readjust to life in Jamaica". There  was  plainly  no  question  of  SC
    readjusting to life in  Jamaica  (as  opposed  to  simply  "adjusting")
    because she has never lived there. I am not persuaded that the error of
    fact in paragraph 93 is not material to the decision - reaching the age
    of 9 brought SC very close to an application for UK citizenship and the
    authorities make it clear  that  the  period  from  age  7  onwards  is
    particularly important when assessing the degree of independent private
    life that has been built up by a child. I therefore find that the judge
    has made a material error of fact when assessing  reasonableness,  best
    interests and the strength of SC's private life in the UK.  That  is  a
    material error of law.

22. I have not found it necessary to  consider  the  remaining  grounds  of
    appeal which all involve matters which can be argued at the  rehearing.
    It is certainly arguable that  the  finding  at  paragraph  94  of  the
    decision that it was not in SC's best interests to remain in the UK was
    not soundly based upon the evidence.

23. Thus, the First-tier Tribunal's decision  to  dismiss  the  appellant's
    appeal involved the making of an error of law and its  decision  cannot
    stand.


Decision

24. Both representatives invited me to remake the  decision  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal if I set aside the  judge's  decision.  However,  the  factual
    matrix of the appeal has now changed because the SC has now reached the
    age of 10 and applied for registration as a UK citizen on  15  February
    2016. The factual issues to be  determined  are  reasonably  extensive.
    Bearing in mind  paragraph  7.2  of  the  Senior  President's  Practice
    Statements I do not consider that retention in the Upper Tribunal is an
    appropriate course of action. I find that the error of law infects  the
    decision as a whole and therefore the re-hearing will be de  novo  with
    all issues to be considered again by the First-tier Tribunal.

25. Consequently, I set aside the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal.  I
    order the appeal to be heard again in the  First-Tier  Tribunal  to  be
    determined de novo by a judge other than the previous First-tier judge.
