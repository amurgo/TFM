Representation:
For the Appellant:     No attendance
For the Respondent:    Mr T Melvin, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant was granted permission to appeal a decision of First-tier
    Tribunal Judge G A Black who in a decision of 2nd July  2018  dismissed
    his appeal.  The grounds of appeal submitted that  the  judge  had  not
    followed a binding decision of a higher court, had overlooked important
    evidence and/or failed to ask for more evidence "by hearing with  legal
    assistant (requested) where appellant  not  much  understandable  about
    legal terminology" (sic).

 2. Further the judge had made a decision for which there was  no  evidence
    or not enough evidence and the matters had proceeded unfairly.

 3. The grounds asserted

         "I believed failure to have regards to  material  evidence,  taking
         into  account  and  being  influenced   by   immaterial   evidence,
         inadequate reasons and unproved, unfair procedure, misunderstanding
         or misconstruction of the relevant fact and law  without  giving  a
         chance   for   hearing/witness   and   without   legal    assistant
         unfair/injustice  determination  and  lack   of   legal   assistant
         (lawyer), disregarding a relevant statutory provision,  failing  to
         give  effect  to  a  binding  decision  of  a  Superior  Court  any
         irrationality (sic)."

 4. The grounds also added

         "I  believed  where  most  mistaken  by  Home   Office   Caseworker
         (official) have got audio record) and  Home  Office  mistake  could
         misleading the determination, judge failure to justify and  not  to
         give credit to the appellant account.  Failing to take account baby
         best interest where she is born in UK  and  her  age  of  4ï¿½  years
         nearly attending in school."

 5. Permission to appeal was granted on the basis that the grounds had been
    "without any mention of any specific  errors  relating  to  the  actual
    appeal before the Tribunal".  It was noted that the appeal was a  paper
    appeal and the judge's conclusions were set out  in  short  compass  at
    paragraphs 7 and 8 and explained that the details  of  the  claim  were
    inconsistent and contained discrepancies.

 6. However, the permission added that there was no mention of Article 8 in
    the decision nor any mention of Section 55 of the Borders,  Citizenship
    and Immigration Act 2009.  Nor was  there  any  conclusion  on  whether
    there had been interference with family or private life or any  mention
    of the balancing exercise undertaken in regard to proportionality.

 7. The Secretary of State filed a Rule 24 response on 20th September  2018
    opposing  the  appellant's  appeal  and  stating  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge had inter alia directed herself appropriately.  It was a
    paper hearing and, on the evidence, which was provided the  judge  made
    findings which were open to her.  The grounds had been settled  by  the
    appellant but were in essence a disagreement with the judge's  findings
    which referred to the discrepancies in the appellant's asylum claim and
    gave sufficient reasons for making adverse credibility findings.

 8. The grant of permission was triggered  by  the  question  of  the  best
    interests  of  the  child  but  the  appellant's  daughter  was  not  a
    qualifying child.  The judge does not refer to the Section  55  per  se
    but it is concluded that it would be reasonable  for  her  to  move  to
    Bangladesh.

 9. As to a proportionality assessment it was evident on the factual matrix
    of the case that there would be no unjustifiably harsh consequences  on
    the appellant and his dependants should they return.

10. Prior to the hearing the appellant requested that the hearing  be  held
    in private and that he wished for the Upper Tribunal to  provide  legal
    representation.  It was pointed out that the Upper Tribunal  could  not
    provide legal representation which  was  available  from  a  number  of
    sources elsewhere and there was no apparent reason  for  a  hearing  in
    private but this could be raised at the hearing itself.  It was an open
    matter for the appellant's wife as to whether she attended or not.

11. The appellant did not attend the hearing before me, but I am  persuaded
    that the appellant had the date, time and hearing of the venue and  had
    chosen not to make any further application for an adjournment or indeed
    submit any further evidence.

12. In conclusion, the grounds of application for permission to  appeal  go
    no way to undermining the decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge and
    no specific error of law was identified  with  any  examples  from  the
    evidence.

13. The judge specifically found that the appellant  was  a  national  from
    Bangladesh married and had a child born here in 2014.  The judge  noted
    that the appellant entered the UK as a student with leave in 2007 until
    February 2014.  His application for leave to remain under  family  life
    was refused on 20th July 2015 but he did not claim  asylum  until  11th
    May 2016.

14. The appellant was married to a  Bangladesh  national  and  he  and  his
    partner had a child born in the UK.

15. The judge clearly found that the claim in relation to asylum related to
    a family matter and the appellant had  not  discharged  the  burden  of
    proof even on the lower standard.  The judge set out that she had  read
    the letters in support from the appellant and the record of his  asylum
    interview which set out details of his claim.  She specifically  stated
    that the details of the claim  set  out  in  the  refusal  letter  were
    internally inconsistent and there were discrepancies in  the  dates  of
    material events.  Further the account given by the appellant was  vague
    and confused (he claimed that he had received threats from a Bangladesh
    police officer and his sister-in-law to enter into an arranged marriage
    with her in an attempt to or ploy to receive the inheritance  from  his
    parents.

16.  He  feared  returning  to  Bangladesh  as  the  people  involved  were
    influential and he feared being  killed.   The  judge  found  that  the
    appellant claimed that he had been  the  subject  of  a  complaint  for
    sexual harassment from his "wife".  However, in interview it was put to
    the appellant that the document produced related to a complaint  of  an
    offence for which he had been convicted  under  the  Dowry  Prohibition
    Act.  The judge specifically rejected the appellant's  account  of  the
    mistake (that it was the interpreter) and that  the  document  produced
    related to family matters not sexual harassment.  The judge gave  sound
    reasoning to  the  effect  that  the  appellant  would  have  read  the
    documents that he relied on in his own asylum claim and therefore would
    have known their contents.

17. The further evidence was considered and his delay in his  asylum  claim
    from 2011 damaged his credibility under Section 8 of the  Treatment  of
    Claimants Act 2004.

18. The judge with respect to Article 8 set out that he could not meet  the
    requirements of the family and  private  life  and  the  appellant  had
    failed to show that he met any of the parent or partner rules  or  that
    he met paragraph 276ADE.  He had spent the  majority  of  his  life  in
    Bangladesh and  was  educated  and  will  be  able  to  find  work  and
    reintegrate without much difficulty.  Turning to the assessment of  the
    child the judge did specifically state that  the  appellant's  daughter
    was born in the UK and at school but was under the age of  4  (that  is
    compulsory school age) and it was reasonable that  she  could  move  to
    Bangladesh with the appellant and his wife as a family unit.  The child
    was clearly not a qualifying child.  Their medical  evidence  took  the
    case no further.

19. Bearing in mind the appellant was aware that the hearing  was  a  paper
    hearing before the First-tier Tribunal it was open  to  him  to  submit
    evidence at that stage.  It was also  open  to  him  to  have  an  oral
    hearing which he chose not to do.  There  is  no  indication  that  the
    judge failed to take note of the relevant information before her.

20. On 12th  September  2018  the  appellant  for  the  hearing  before  me
    submitted a further bundle attaching

         "some of additional extended FTT document,  will  be  mentioned  in
         bundle as extended FTT, like some case document paper as well which
         is filed against me in origin country which  some  of  them  wasn't
         before First-tier Tribunal because the original in English and some
         of other than English original was in Home Office which  additional
         copy was not available to me to  translate/was  not  available  and
         from the origin of country complained."

21. There is no evidence that the judge failed  to  consider  the  evidence
    that was before her and any evidence that was not before her,  such  as
    that supplied by the appellant to the Upper Tribunal, cannot  form  the
    basis for criticism for lack of consideration.

22. The judge gave sound reasons for rejecting the asylum claim and  having
    done so there was no reason and no evidence filed before the First-tier
    Tribunal  to  suggest  that  the  appellant   would   experience   very
    significant obstacles to his return to Bangladesh.   This  is  in  line
    with Kaur, R (on the application of) v Secretary of State for the  Home
    Department [2018] EWCA Civ 1423.   If, effectively, reliance is  placed
    on mere assertion and evidence is not put forward as to  insurmountable
    obstacles (such as lack of ties abroad), the exacting test will not  be
    met.  Mere practical difficulty will not suffice [55].

23. It is not for the judge to search for the evidence to demonstrate  very
    significant obstacles but for the appellant to provide  information  to
    the  Tribunal  which  goes  beyond  mere  assertion  that   there   are
    difficulties on return.

24. The judge identified that the child was very young, had  been  born  in
    the UK but was clearly of Bangladesh nationality, was not at school and
    it was reasonable for the child to  relocate  to  Bangladesh  with  the
    child's parents.  As  set  out  in  KO  (Nigeria)  [2018]  UKSC  53  at
    paragraph 18 it will normally be reasonable for a child to be with  the
    parents.   To  that  extent  the  record  of  the  parents  may  become
    indirectly material.  It should be  noted  that  the  child  is  not  a
    qualifying child under  paragraph  276ADE(1)(iv)  or  qualifying  under
    Section 117B(6).  Although this judgment was not published prior to the
    hearing before the First-tier Tribunal Judge it explains the  law,  and
    it is clear that the immigration history  of  the  parents  may  become
    directly material if it leads to their  ceasing  to  have  a  right  to
    remain here and having to leave.  In this case the parents had no right
    to remain in the UK and it was entirely open to the judge  to  conclude
    that if neither parent had the  right  to  remain  then  that  was  the
    background against which the assessment was to be concluded.  The judge
    did exactly that.  There was an implicit consideration of  the  child's
    best interests and for these reasons there was no error of law  in  the
    decision and the decision shall stand.

25. As the Rule 24 response  pointed  out  the  appeal  was  essentially  a
    disagreement with the findings of the judge.

Order

The  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Black  shall   stand.    The
appellant's appeal remains dismissed.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
