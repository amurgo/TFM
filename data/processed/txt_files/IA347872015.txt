For the Appellant:     In Person
For the Respondent:    Mr T Wilding, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant is a citizen  of  India  born  on  20th  June  1991.   He
    appealed against the decision of the respondent taken on 29th July 2015
    to refuse his application to vary his leave to  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom outside the Immigration Rules made on 15th January, 2015.   The
    appellant was granted leave to remain as a  Tier  4  (General)  Student
    from 20th March 2015, but that leave was  curtailed  on  27th  February
    2014 because the appellant's Tier 4 sponsor had stopped sponsoring  him
    because the appellant had finished his course early and  this  resulted
    in a new visa expiry date of 28th April, 2014.

2.   The respondent noted that the appellant was now seeking to  vary  leave
    to remain outside the Immigration Rules in order to secure  a  new  CAS
    letter, but had been unable to do so and was applying for further leave
    to remain in order to resolve the situation.

3.   The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal and  his  appeal  was
    heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge Herlihy  on  9th  March  2017.   The
    Immigration Appeal Tribunal file shows that  the  appellant  originally
    lodged  an  application  on  7th  December  2015  without  a  fee.   An
    application for a Lord Chancellor's Certificate of Fee Satisfaction was
    applied for and refused.  The Tribunal notified the  appellant  that  a
    fee of ï¿½140 was required by 12th January 2016.  On  21st  January  2016
    the Tribunal  wrote  to  the  appellant  advising  him  that  the  Lord
    Chancellor had revoked his Certificate for  Fee  Satisfaction  and  the
    appeal had been struck out.  The appellant wrote  a  letter  from  [  ]
    Hayes, Middlesex to the Courts and Tribunal Services explaining that he
    had not received letters from the Tribunal regarding payment for a  fee
    and had previously been let down by a solicitor.  The fee was  paid  on
    line and the appellant wrote to the Tribunal on 25th  January  advising
    the Tribunal.

4.   As a result, following an application  for  reinstatement  received  by
    the  Tribunal  on  25th  January  2016,  the  Tribunal   accepted   the
    reinstatement and gave notification of reinstatement to  the  appellant
    at his home address on 12th February 2016.  On 14th February 2016,  the
    Tribunal wrote giving the appellant notice of the time, date and  place
    fixed for the hearing of the appeal on Thursday 9th March 2017, at 10am
    at Taylor House, 88 Rosebery Avenue, London EC1.  That was sent to  the
    appellant by second class post to him at his address at [  ]  Hayes  on
    14th October 2016.

5.   When the matter came for hearing before  Judge  Herlihy  there  was  no
    appearance by or  on  behalf  of  the  appellant  at  11.30am  and  she
    proceeded to hear the appeal in his absence.  In fact,  no  explanation
    had been offered for the appellant's non-attendance.

6.   The judge noted that  the  respondent  refused  the  application  under
    paragraph 322(1) of the Statement of Changes in  Immigration  Rules  HC
    395 (as amended), because the appellant was applying for  leave  for  a
    purpose not covered by the Immigration Rules and paragraph 322(1) is  a
    mandatory ground of refusal.  The judge noted that  the  appellant  had
    submitted no evidence in support of the appeal and had not set out  any
    grounds in the Notice of Appeal.  Being unable to discharge the  burden
    of proof on him to the standard required,  the  judge  found  that  the
    decision of the respondent was in accordance with the law.   The  judge
    dismissed the appeal.

7.   The appellant sought and was granted  permission  to  appeal,  claiming
    that he did not receive any Notice of Hearing and was  waiting  for  it
    and would have attended the hearing had he received it.  Today  he  has
    offered no explanation as to why  that  letter  should  not  have  been
    received by him, given that earlier letters were, and he has  confirmed
    that he lives at the same address.  His application was for  a  purpose
    outside the Immigration Rules and it, therefore, fell to be mandatorily
    refused under paragraph 322(1) by the respondent.  The judge  dismissed
    the appellant's appeal believing there were  no  grounds  for  thinking
    that the Secretary of State's decision was wrong.

8.   Mr Wilding submitted to me that the appeal was in any event  doomed  to
    fail.  The appellant claims not to have received notice of the hearing,
    but given that he was in  correspondence  with  the  Tribunal  in  2006
    concerning the payment of a fee with his original Notice of Appeal  and
    given that he was subsequently told that the appeal was reinstated,  it
    is surprising that he took no steps to enquire of the Tribunal when his
    appeal was to be heard.  However, even if I were to find  that  because
    of a failure to give him Notice of Appeal  because,  for  example,  the
    Notice of Appeal was delivered to the wrong address,  or  lost  by  the
    Post Office, the fact of the matter is that he cannot possibly  succeed
    in this appeal which can only be dismissed.

9.   The  Appellant  has  been  given  every  opportunity  today  to  adduce
    whatever evidence he wished and it has been explained to him that since
    he applied for permission to remain in the United Kingdom  outside  the
    Rules, in other words, for a purpose not  covered  by  the  Immigration
    Rules, his application had to be dismissed by the Secretary  of  State.
    The Secretary of State's decision in dismissing  that  application  was
    not wrong.

10.  I have concluded that even if because of an  administrative  error  the
    appellant was denied the opportunity of presenting  an  appeal  to  the
    judge, he has however been given every opportunity today to present  an
    appeal to me, but the fact remains  that  his  appeal  is  doomed.   It
    cannot succeed.  The appellant's appeal is dismissed.

Notice of Decision

The appeal is dismissed.

No anonymity direction is made.
