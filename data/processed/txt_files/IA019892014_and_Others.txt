Appellant     Unrepresented
Respondent    Mr Tufan (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                             NOTICE OF DECISION


     1. The Appellant had  applied  to  join  his  mother,  Ms  Dolapo  Becy
        Adeyemi, who had limited leave to remain in the United Kingdom as  a
        highly skilled migrant. The Respondent refused  his  application  on
        May 13, 2013 under paragraph 319H (b) and (c) HC 395.


     2. The Appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal  (Immigration  and
        Asylum) under Section 82(1) Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act
        2002 (hereinafter called the 2002 Act) and on April 10,  2014  Judge
        of the First-tier Tribunal Lawence (hereinafter called "the  Judge")
        heard his appeal. He dismissed  the  appellant's  appeal  under  the
        Immigration Rules and Article 8 ECHR in a  decision  promulgated  on
        April 24, 2014.

     3. On July 29, 2014 the appellant's solicitors,  OA  Solicitors,  wrote
        the following letter-

             "We continue to act for the above named appellant  in  respect
             of his immigration appeal. We are instructed to  withdraw  the
             appeal. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you  have  any
             question."

     4. Mr Tufan did not object to the appellant withdrawing his appeal.

     5. Rule 17 The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 allows  a
        party to withdraw an appeal but sub-section (2) states,  "notice  of
        withdrawal will not take effect until the Upper Tribunal consents to
        withdrawal except in an application for permission to appeal".

     6. In the circumstances I agreed to the withdrawal of the appeal.

     7. The effect of this withdrawal is that the original decision stands.
