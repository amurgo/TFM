For the Respondent:    Mr S Hyder, Legal Representative


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The Secretary of State  has  been  granted  permission  to  appeal  the
    determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Eldridge   who   in   a
    determination promulgated on 1 December 2014 allowed the appeal of  the
    respondent against the refusal of his application for leave  to  remain
    as a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant.  The respondent was required  to
    obtain 10 points in respect of funds relating to his maintenance  under
    Appendix C.  These points  were  not  issued  to  him  because  details
    concerning a bank account used to  demonstrate  those  funds  had  been
    "proven to be false".  Accordingly the application  was  refused  under
    paragraph 322(1A) of the Rules on the basis that  false  documents  had
    been submitted in relation to the application.

2.   The Secretary of State relied on a Document  Verification  Report  from
    an Entry Clearance Assistant in the British High Commission  in  Dhaka.
    The assistant concerned had been asking whether First  Security  Islami
    Bank Limited could verify a letter dated  21  November  2013  that  was
    attached to the report and a statement generated on the same date.  The
    letter is said to have been issued by Mr Hossain, Assistant Manager  of
    the Dovashi Bazar Branch and the statement referred to the same branch.
     The judge held as follows:

         "14. In the section entitled 'Financial Document Verification'  the
             documents concerned are described as a  bank  solvency  letter
             and a bank statement.  The 'Branch Locations (sic)',  however,
             is described as 'Head Office'.  The officer reports  that  the
             bank was called on 06 February 2014 using a  telephone  number
             which has been redacted so no-one in these proceedings may see
             what that number was.  The contact suggests that bank  records
             demonstrate that the account concerned existed  but  that  the
             'bank statement and solvency letter was not issued by the said
             Branch.  Both are forged'.   It  goes  on  to  say  that  'the
             information held by the bank differs from what is detailed  in
             the documents that were provided in support of the application
             form'.


         15.  Allegation of forgery or falsehood is a  serious  matter.   On
             the face of this document it appears that the head  office  of
             the bank concerned was contacted rather than the  branch  said
             to have  issued  the  documents  and  that  same  head  office
             confirmed that, whilst the account was known  to  exist,  'the
             said Branch' did not issue the statement and solvency  letter.
             Given that the only reference in this verification document to
             a branch is that of the head office, it would be surprising if
             they did have record of the documents because it has been said
             all along that they have been  issued  by  the  Dovashi  Bazar
             Branch and by its assistant manager in particular.


         16.  On the basis of this document report I am not at all satisfied
             that the documents relied upon by  the  Appellant  are  false.
             The Respondent has not  discharged  the  burden  upon  her  to
             demonstrate that they were and refusal under Paragraph 322(1A)
             cannot be justified.  Because the  Respondent  states  in  the
             refusal document that  refusal  under  the  substantive  Rule,
             Paragraph 245ZX is based upon the refusal under Paragraph 322,
             that refusal cannot be in accordance with the Rules either."


3.   The Secretary of State was granted permission  to  appeal.   The  first
    ground challenged the judge's findings at paragraphs 14 to  16  of  the
    determination.  It was said that it  is  common  ground  and  generally
    accepted that the identities and  contact  information  of  sources  on
    behalf of the Secretary of  State  are  kept  anonymous  by  virtue  of
    potential risks to them in the form of recriminations relating  to  the
    information they are providing or potential  corruption  opportunities.
    It is also common practice to refer enquiries to  the  head  office  of
    financial   establishments   (generally   referred   to   in   document
    verification  reports  as  "central  points  of   contact"   who   have
    computerised access to information relating to all their  branches  and
    who are considered reliable sources).

4.   It was further argued  that  it  was  irrational  to  conclude  that  a
    professional establishment would respond negatively to  a  request  for
    confirmation of documents rather than indicating if that were the case,
    that they are unable to confirm genuineness due  to  the  documentation
    not having been issued by that particular branch.   In  any  event  the
    head office also confirmed that the account  in  question  existed  and
    that the information held by the bank differed from  that  detailed  in
    the documents that were provided with the application form.  This  fact
    alone was sufficient to render the documentation false even if  it  was
    accepted that there could be elements of doubt over  whether  the  head
    office was saying that they specifically did not issue the documents or
    whether they were saying the documents had not been issued by the "said
    branch" meaning the respondent's branch.   Ms  Everett  relied  on  the
    first ground of appeal.

5.   The second ground argued that in allowing the appeal  outright  without
    consideration of the substantive merits of the case  under  245ZX,  the
    Immigration Judge erred in law.  The right approach would have been  to
    allow the appeal to the limited extent that it was  not  in  accordance
    with the law by virtue of the burden to  demonstrate  forgery  had  not
    been made out and therefore remitted back to the Secretary of State for
    further consideration.  Reliance was placed on RM (Kwok on  Tong  HC395
    para 320) India [2006] UKAIT 00039.  Reliance was  also  placed  on  JF
    (para 320 refusal: substantive rule) Bangladesh [2008] UKAIT 00008.

6.   Ms Everett did not rely on the second ground.  She said that the  judge
    should have considered the substantive merits of the appeal.

7.   I found that the document verification report was quite  confusing.   I
    agreed with Mr Hyder that the HOPO below did not make the  judge  aware
    that verification of bank documents  are  conducted  through  the  head
    offices of financial establishments and  not  the  local  branch  which
    issued the documents.  It appears  from  the  DVR  that  the  assistant
    contacted the bank by telephone.  There  was  no  indication  from  the
    report whether the head office official at First Security  Islami  Bank
    Ltd who took the phone call had sight of the  documents  prior  to  the
    telephone conversation and had  already  checked  the  authenticity  of
    these documents to enable him or her to respond to the questions raised
    by the ECO's assistant.  In the absence of clarity of these matters,  I
    do not find on the evidence before the  judge,  that  his  findings  at
    paragraphs 14 and  15  were  erroneous.   Accordingly  I  uphold  those
    findings.

8.   I  find  however  the  judge  erred  in  allowing  the  appeal  without
    determining the substantive merits of the respondent's application. The
    issue was whether the respondent had the required level of  funds  over
    the relevant 28 day period leading up to the date of application.

9.   The date of application was 10 December 2014.   Thirty  days  backwards
    from the date of application would be 10  November  2013.   This  means
    that the respondent was required to show that he was in  possession  of
    �1,600 for a consecutive 28 day period to meet  the  Tier  4  (General)
    Student maintenance requirements.  In view of the Secretary of  State's
    failure to prove that the documents emanating from  the  Dovashi  Bazar
    Branch were false, I was satisfied on the evidence that the  respondent
    had discharged the burden of proof on him.  Accordingly, I find that he
    was in possession of �1,600 for a consecutive 28 day period and that he
    met the Tier 4 (General) Student maintenance requirements.

Notice of Decision

10.  The respondent's appeal is allowed.
