Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr U Sheikh, Ansar Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr D Clarke, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, appeals with permission, the determination of First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Cary who in a decision promulgated on 26th November 2018
    dismissed her appeal against the respondent's decision  to  refuse  her
    protection and human rights claim.

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Thailand, born on 3rd January 1991 and is
    now aged 28.  She is a transgender woman as her  gender  identity  does
    not correspond to the male gender assigned to her at birth.  She states
    she arrived in the United Kingdom 2014 and came to the attention of the
    authorities in early  2015  when  she  was  arrested.   The  respondent
    accepted that the appellant was trafficked  into  the  United  Kingdom.
    She confirmed in her "method of entry" interview on 3rd July 2015  that
    she had been told  in  Thailand  that  she  was  going  to  work  in  a
    restaurant but when she arrived, she was forced to work as  an  escort.
    The authorities concluded that there were reasonable grounds to believe
    that she had been trafficked into the United Kingdom  on  27th  January
    2015.

 3. The appellant, in  her  claim  for  protection,  stated  that  she  had
    incurred a substantial debt to fund the cost of her trip to the  United
    Kingdom which she had repaid in the sum of approximately �50,000.   She
    said that she would face problems  in  Thailand  if  she  was  returned
    because her family in Thailand had  subsequently  borrowed  some  money
    which was still outstanding and needed to be repaid; if it were not  it
    would be dangerous for her family and herself.  She also said that  she
    would face problems in view of her wish to change gender and  that  she
    wished to have a sex change operation in the United Kingdom.

 4. The Secretary of State, on 16th September 2018, accepted that she was a
    victim of human trafficking but rejected her  claim  for  international
    protection on 3rd October 2018 because it was not considered she  would
    be at significant risk of re-trafficking on  her  return  to  Thailand.
    She would  not  experience  problems  entitling  her  to  international
    protection and she would not  be  of  genuine  interest  to  anyone  in
    Thailand owing to an outstanding debt.

 5. The First-tier Tribunal judge in his determination at paragraph 29 made
    findings in relation to the appellant's circumstances  noting  that  he
    took into account her age, level of education, health and the  evidence
    she had given throughout her application.  He found that the  appellant
    was not uneducated; she had stated that she had attended high school in
    Thailand and that although she started university she did  not  finish.
    In her asylum interview, where the appellant was  legally  represented,
    she confirmed that she left school at 18 and achieved the equivalent of
    sixth form.  She said she had worked as a dancer from the age of 18  or
    19 and confirmed that she was well enough to be interviewed.  The judge
    noted that the  appellant  confirmed  she  did  not  have  any  medical
    conditions although she had attended a psychiatrist once or  twice;  no
    evidence of that had been  produced.   The  judge  found  that  in  the
    evidence before him she did not have any diagnosed health condition.

 6. Specifically, the judge took into account that the appellant  had  been
    found to be a victim of  trafficking  and  the  judge  also  took  into
    account the child, vulnerable adult and sensitive  appellant  guidance,
    the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note  No.  2  of  2010  on  Vulnerable
    Witnesses.  There is no indication that the judge did  not  apply  this
    throughout his assessment of the evidence and the determination.

 7. The judge described  at  paragraph  32  that  the  appellant  had  been
    assisted in obtaining a visa on condition that she worked in the UK  in
    a restaurant or "something like that" and she was told that  she  would
    have to pay money to cover her food and accommodation for three  months
    but when she arrived she was told that she would have  to  pay  �35,000
    and cover expenses for herself.  That amount  very  soon  increased  to
    almost �50,000.  However, the judge noted that the appellant  confirmed
    that since arriving in the United Kingdom she had paid  off  the  debt.
    She said that her family had borrowed money to help them survive  since
    she had been in the United Kingdom and she had acted as  guarantor  and
    that debt had not been repaid.  It was dangerous  for  her  should  she
    return and those people,  [to  whom  money  was  owed]  were  rich  and
    powerful.  She also said it would be hard  for  her  to  find  work  in
    Thailand and it would dangerous because she would wish  to  change  her
    gender.

 8. At paragraph 33 the judge recorded that in  fact  it  was  the  mother,
    rather than the appellant, who had borrowed money from someone  by  the
    name of W and the family home had been used to guarantee the loan.  The
    judge also noted that the appellant maintained that  she  had  borrowed
    money and still owed between �8,000 to �10,000 but  this  was  borrowed
    from someone called N from whom she had not heard from for a long  time
    and when she had told her that she would not be  able  to  do  anything
    about transferring the money to her she had said "OK never mind".   The
    judge also recorded that since the initial amount  of  money  had  been
    borrowed from W her mother had not borrowed any more from him  but  had
    borrowed from neighbours.

 9. The judge at paragraph 35 to 36 set out the legislative  provisions  in
    relation to the  Council  of  European  Convention  on  Action  Against
    Trafficking in Human Beings "The  Trafficking  Convention"  or  "ECAT".
    The judge also set out the  Convention  definition  of  trafficking  in
    human beings.

10. The judge proceeded from paragraphs 37 to  57  to  assess  whether  the
    appellant was at risk on  return  to  Thailand  of  re-trafficking  and
    considered AZ (trafficked women) Thailand CG [2010] UKUT  118  and  the
    appellant's circumstances therein finding that the appellant was not at
    risk of re-trafficking on return to Thailand.  The judge also proceeded
    to consider the  appellant's  rights  in  relation  to  Article  8  but
    dismissed the appeal on both protection and human rights grounds.

Application for Permission to Appeal

11. The appellant challenged the determination of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge on two grounds:

      i) Material Misdirection of Law and Discrimination

         The Tribunal rejected the appellant's protection and  human  rights
         appeals relating to discrimination owing to  her  gender  identity.
         The determination noted that transgender people in  Thailand  could
         not change their gender on their identity documents but  held  that
         this "did not assist her" (paragraph 57).  There was no  indication
         of a legal basis for this finding and it failed to make findings on
         her inability to change her title or her inability to marry a  man.
         The correct legal test as set out in the skeleton of  6th  November
         2018 (paragraphs 17 to 18 and 25 to 29) had  not  been  identified.
         The  determination  failed  to  follow  the  correct  procedure  in
         identifying the  correct  legal  tests  and  making  the  necessary
         findings of fact for each ground.  It  was  important  to  consider
         whether she was a vulnerable person and had the correct tests  been
         applied the appeal would have been allowed.  It was  asserted  that
         the  appellant  feared  discrimination  and   this   discrimination
         constituted persecution because of the active  concealment  of  her
         identity by the State contrary to Article 9(2)(b) and  (f)  of  the
         Council Directive 2004/83/EC.

               2. Acts of persecution as qualified in paragraph 1 can  inter
                  alia take the form of

                  ...

                  (b)   legal,  administrative,  police,   and/or   judicial
                      measures which are in  themselves  discriminatory  or
                      which are implemented in a discriminatory manner;

                  ...

                  (f)  acts of a gender specific or child specific nature."

         Thus, persecution did not only involve violence; the discrimination
         would breach her human rights because:

          a) it breached her right to privacy by forcing her to disclose to
             others her birth biological sex;

          b) it denied her own official identity; and

          c) it breached her right to official recognition  of  her  gender
             identity which was achieved in the UK contrary  to  Goodwin  v
             United Kingdom 28957/95.  Goodwin held, at paragraph  90  that
             the very essence  of  the  Convention  is  respect  for  human
             dignity and human freedom and that  under  Article  8  of  the
             Convention, protection is given to the personal sphere of each
             individual including the right to establish details  of  their
             identity as individual human beings.  In the 21st century  the
             right of transsexuals to personal development and to  physical
             and moral integrity in the full sense  enjoyed  by  others  in
             society cannot be regarded as a matter of controversy.

         The unsatisfactory situation in which  post-operative  transsexuals
         lived in an intermediate zone as not quite one gender or the  other
         was no longer sustainable.  It was found at paragraph 93 of Goodwin
         that there had accordingly been a failure to respect  private  life
         under Article 8.  The grounds cited Ullah v The Special Adjudicator
         [2004] UKHL 26 which held at paragraph 50 that

             "It  will  be  apparent  from   the   review   of   Strasbourg
             jurisprudence that where other Articles may become  engaged  a
             high threshold test will always have to be satisfied.  It will
             be necessary to establish at least a real risk of  a  flagrant
             violation of the very essence of the right for other  Articles
             could become engaged."

         Further, R (C) v Secretary of State for Work  and  Pensions  [2017]
         UKSC 72 emphasised the centrality of  gender  in  any  individual's
         sense  of  self  holding  in  relation  to  gender  dysmorphia   at
         paragraphs 28-29

             "Those of us who, whatever our  occasional  frustrations  with
             the  expectations  of  society  or  our   own   biology,   are
             nevertheless quite secure in the gender identities with  which
             we were born, can scarcely begin to understand how it must  be
             to grow up in the wrong body and then to go through  the  long
             and complex process of adapting that body to  match  the  real
             self. But it does not take much imagination to understand that
             this is a deeply personal and private matter;  that  a  person
             who has undergone gender  reassignment  will  need  the  whole
             world to recognise  and  relate  to  her  or  to  him  in  the
             reassigned gender; and  will  want  to  keep  to  an  absolute
             minimum any unwanted disclosure of the history.  This  is  not
             only because other people can be insensitive and  even  cruel;
             the evidence is that transphobic incidents are increasing  and
             that transgender people  experience  high  levels  of  anxiety
             about this. It is also because of  their  deep  need  to  live
             successfully  and  peacefully  in  their  reassigned   gender,
             something  which   non-transgender   people   can   take   for
             granted."[28]

         R(C) held that the European Court of Human Rights in  Goodwin  made
         the important point that gender identity goes to  the  heart  of  a
         person's sense itself and at [29] "the way in  which  the  law  and
         officialdom treat people who have undergone gender reassignment  is
         no trivial matter.

     ii) Inadequate reasons on trafficking

         The second ground asserted the judge gave  inadequate  reasons  for
         finding the appellant was not at risk of  trafficking  particularly
         from  new  traffickers.   The  fact  that  she  had  already   been
         trafficked was a serious indication of future persecution.  Article
         4(4) of Council Directive 2004/83/EC.  As set out in AZ (Trafficked
         Women) Thailand CG [2010] UKUT 118, former victims  of  trafficking
         are even more vulnerable to re-trafficking.

Grant of permission to appeal

12. Permission to appeal was granted on the basis that it was arguable that
    having stated that he needed to consider the  position  of  transgender
    people in Thailand and  outlined  the  background  evidence  the  judge
    failed to make any findings on the issue and some consideration  needed
    to be given to the legal position for transgender people in Thailand.

13. The grant stated that the second point on permission was less  arguable
    because the judge gave comprehensive reasons for finding  that  it  was
    likely that the appellant no longer owed a debt to those who trafficked
    her to the UK but it was arguable that the  judge  failed  to  consider
    whether she was someone who showed characteristics  that  might  render
    her vulnerable to re-trafficking.

The hearing

14. At the hearing before me,  Mr  Sheikh  submitted  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal had not engaged with the first  ground.   The  fact  that  the
    appellant could not change her legal gender or title or marry a man  in
    Thailand was central to her claim and this was relevant to  the  asylum
    claim.  It was also a breach of Article 8  because  those  issues  were
    relevant to her reintegration.  It has been established that she  could
    not be required to lie but the State of Thailand perpetuated a  lie  in
    which she was required to acquiesce.  If she was required  to  carry  a
    card saying she was a man that would be very humiliating for her.

15. In response, Mr Clarke relied on HJ (Iran) [2010]  UKSC  31  and  noted
    that the judge had considered risk of persecution at paragraph  57  and
    Article 8.  In relation to asylum the appellant had relied on Article 9
    because of an active concealment of identification but the grounds  did
    not deal with the  threshold  of  persecution  and  that  according  to
    Article 9(1A) needed to be sufficiently serious (check).   There  is  a
    threshold.  BF (Tirana - gay men) Albania CG [2019]  UKUT  00093  (IAC)
    confirmed that the fact that laws were not in place to allow  same  sex
    marriage was not enough to constitute persecution.  At paragraph 47  of
    the determination it was clear that the judge had  taken  into  account
    the  cumulative  effects  in  relation  to  those  who  identified   as
    transgender in Thailand and the judge had  made  specific  findings  at
    paragraph 48.  The judge had looked at the change in identify  and  the
    challenge was purely on the singular extraction from Article 9  without
    appreciating the context and threat held which was not addressed in the
    grounds of appeal.

16. In relation to the Article 8 findings the judge  had  at  paragraph  51
    considered the Rules and considered Kamara v SSHD [2016] EWCA  Civ  813
    finding no  very  significant  obstacles  to  reintegration  and  those
    findings were not challenged.  The last section  of  paragraph  57  did
    consider her sex change  operation  and  ability  to  marry  which  was
    challenged but that was a proportionality assessment and it was open to
    the judge to give weight to the relevant factors.

17. The determination was sustainable  and  there  was  nothing  which  was
    compelling circumstances outside the Immigration Rules.

Analysis

18. Article 9 (2) of the Council Directive 2004/38/EC was set  out  in  the
    grounds as above and Article 9(1) is incorporated in the discussion  of
    HJ (Iran) [2010] UKSC 31 below.  The Supreme Court in HJ, at  paragraph
    12, emphasised that the Convention (relating to the Status of  Refugees
    1951) does not define persecution, but recognised that it is a powerful
    word and further, at paragraph  15  explored  the  limitations  of  the
    Convention as follows:

         "12.     The Convention does not define "persecution".  But it  has
             been recognised that it is a strong word: Sepet and  Bulbul  v
             Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2003]  UKHL  15,
             [2002] 1 WLR 856, para 7, per Lord Bingham. Referring  to  the
             dictionary definitions which accord with  common  usage,  Lord
             Bingham said  that  it  indicates  the  infliction  of  death,
             torture or penalties for adherence to  a  belief  or  opinion,
             with a view to the repression or extirpation of  it.   Article
             9(1)(a) of the EC  Council  Directive  2004/83/EC  on  minimum
             standards for the qualification and status  of  third  country
             nationals or stateless persons as refugees ("the Qualification
             Directive") states that acts of persecution must

                  "(a)       be sufficiently  serious  by  their  nature  or
                      repetition as to constitute  a  severe  violation  of
                      basic human rights ... or (b) be an  accumulation  of
                      various  measures,  including  violations  of   human
                      rights which is sufficiently severe as to  affect  an
                      individual in a similar manner as mentioned in (a)."

             In  Appellant  S395/2002  v  Minister  for   Immigration   and
             Multicultural Affairs (2003) 216 CLR 473, para 40, McHugh  and
             Kirby JJ said:

                  "Persecution  covers  many  forms  of  harm  ranging  from
                  physical harm to the loss of intangibles, from  death  and
                  torture to state sponsored or condoned  discrimination  in
                  social life and employment.  Whatever form the harm takes,
                  it will constitute persecution only if, by reason  of  its
                  intensity  or  duration,  the  person  persecuted   cannot
                  reasonably be expected to tolerate it."

         ...

         15.       The  guarantees  in   the   Universal   Declaration   are
             fundamental to a proper understanding of the Convention.   But
             the Convention itself has, as the references in para 12  show,
             a more limited purpose.  It is not enough that  members  of  a
             particular social group are being discriminated against.   The
             contracting states did not undertake to protect  them  against
             discrimination judged according to the standards in their  own
             countries.  Persecution apart, the Convention was not directed
             to reforming the level of rights prevailing in the country  of
             origin.  Its purpose is to provide the protection that is  not
             available in the country of nationality where there is a well-
             founded fear of  persecution,  not  to  guarantee  to  asylum-
             seekers when they are  returned  all  the  freedoms  that  are
             available in the country where they seek refuge.  It does  not
             guarantee universal human  rights.   So  the  conditions  that
             prevail in the country in which asylum is sought have no  part
             to play, as matter of legal obligation binding on  all  states
             parties to the Convention, in deciding whether  the  applicant
             is entitled to seek asylum in that country: Januzi v Secretary
             of State for the Home Department [2006] UKHL 5,  [2006]  2  AC
             426, paras 16, 46.  As Laws LJ said in Amare  v  Secretary  of
             State for the Home Department [2005] EWCA Civ 1600, [2006] Imm
             AR 217 para 31:

                  "The Convention is  not  there  to  safeguard  or  protect
                  potentially  affected  persons  from  having  to  live  in
                  regimes where pluralist liberal values are less respected,
                  even much less respected, than they are here.  It is there
                  to secure international protection to the extent agreed by
                  the contracting states."

         16.      Thus international protection is available only  to  those
             members of the particular social group who can show that  they
             have a well-founded fear of being persecuted  for  reasons  of
             their membership of it who, owing to that fear, are  unwilling
             to avail themselves of the protection of their  home  country.
             Those  who  satisfy  this  test  cannot  be  returned  to  the
             frontiers of a territory where their life or freedom would  be
             threatened on account  of  their  membership  of  that  group:
             article 33(1).  To be accorded this protection,  however,  the
             test that article 1A(2) sets out must first be satisfied.   As
             Lord Bingham of Cornhill said in Januzi v Secretary  of  State
             for the Home Department [2006] 2 AC 426,  para  5,  the  words
             "owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of
             ... membership of a particular social group" in the definition
             of "refugee" express a causative condition which  governs  all
             that follows.

             Well-founded fear: the causative condition".

19. At Paragraph 16 of Januzi [2006] UKHL 5 the  House  of  Lords  held  as
    follows

         'Secondly, acceptance of that rule cannot properly be implied  into
         the Convention. It is of course true, as the appellants  emphasise,
         that the preamble to the Convention  invokes  the  Charter  of  the
         United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human  Rights,  and
         seeks to assure  refugees  the  widest  possible  exercise  of  the
         fundamental rights and freedoms affirmed in  those  documents.  But
         the thrust of the Convention  is  to  ensure  the  fair  and  equal
         treatment of refugees in countries of  asylum,  so  as  to  provide
         effective protection against persecution for Convention reasons. It
         was not  directed  (persecution  apart)  to  the  level  of  rights
         prevailing in the country of nationality. The article  on  refugees
         in the Universal Declaration was authoritatively criticised in 1948
         as "artificial to the point of flippancy" (see  Roma  Rights  case,
         above, para 14), and influential though the Declaration has been it
         lacked any means of  enforcement.  The  International  Covenant  on
         Civil and Political Rights 1966 and the International  Covenant  on
         Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 1966,  compendiously  referred
         to as "the International Bill of Rights", are in  truth  not  such,
         and had yet to be adopted when the Convention was made'

20. It can be seen from the above that the Supreme Court was persuaded that
    there is  a  particular  threshold  for  persecution  and  the  Refugee
    Convention has a limited purpose which does  not  extend  to  economic,
    social and cultural rights.

21. In the context of the findings made in this case can it  be  said  that
    inability to have one's identify be classified, as a  lack  of  respect
    for human rights which posed a threat to life or exposed the  appellant
    to the risk of  inhuman  or  degrading  treatment  or  punishment?  The
    reference in Januzi would suggest that cultural and social  rights  are
    not part of the protected convention rights.  The  violation  of  human
    rights does not have to be physical but it must be severe and even  if,
    as held in Goodwin that it is fundamental to the identify of a  person,
    in order to reach the level of discrimination  which  would  amount  to
    persecution the threshold must be high.  This  must  apply  equally  to
    rights both under the Refugee Convention and the European Convention on
    Human Rights  (Article  3).   It  is  not  enough  that  members  of  a
    particular  social  group  are  being  discriminated  against  and  the
    Convention was not directed to reforming the level of rights prevailing
    in the country of origin, as explained in Horvath v SSHD [2000] UKHL 37



         'It is the severity and persistence of the means  adopted,  whether
         by the state itself, or factions  within  the  state,  which  turns
         discrimination  into  persecution  not   the   absence   of   state
         protection'.

22. The judge made findings in relation to the background material provided
    throughout the determination and specifically at [41] referred  to  the
    2017 US Department State Report on Human Rights Practices  with  regard
    to the general risk faced by  those  who  identify  as  transgender  in
    Thailand and the  risk  of  re-trafficking.   The  judge  set  out  the
    personal details  of  the  appellant  throughout  and  particularly  at
    paragraph 45 as follows:

         "45.     The Appellant will no doubt have the support of her family
             when she returns to Thailand.  In  her  asylum  interview  she
             confirmed that at that stage she was speaking to her mother  2
             or 3 times a week (ASQ 23).  She also confirmed that when  she
             was in Thailand she had lived with  her  mother,  grandfather,
             grandmother and their  families  (ASQ  9).   She  also  has  a
             younger sibling (ASQ11).   There  was  no  evidence  that  her
             immediate family do not accept her identification as a  woman.
             In her asylum interview the  Appellant  said  that  she  began
             dressing as a woman when she was aged 15 (ASQ 178).  She  also
             said that her mother  did  not  have  any  problems  with  her
             identification as a woman (ASQ 175).  The Appellant  does  not
             appear to have experienced any particular difficulties in view
             of her gender  reassignment  in  Thailand.   When  asked  what
             problems she had experienced in her  asylum  interview  simply
             referred to "bad remarks" from neighbours (ASQ 182)."

23. There was no  medical  evidence  to  suggest  that  the  appellant  was
    particularly vulnerable in view of her experience as a trafficked woman
    or as her wish to identify as a woman.

24. At paragraphs 47 to 48 the judge had this to say:

         "47.     I need to consider the position of those who  identify  as
             transgender in Thailand when assessing the  likely  impact  of
             return on the Appellant.  The risk to those  who  identify  as
             transgender is dealt with  in  the  2017  report.   Under  the
             heading "Acts of Violence, Discrimination,  and  Other  Abuses
             Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity"  (section  6)
             the report states that:-

                  'No laws criminalise expression of sexual  orientation  or
                  consensual same-sex sexual conduct between adults.

                  The LGBTI community reported  that  police  treated  LGBTI
                  victims of crime the same as other persons except  in  the
                  case of sexual crimes,  where  there  was  a  tendency  to
                  downplay sexual abuse or not to take harassment seriously.

                  The law does not  permit  transgender  persons  to  change
                  their gender on identification documents,  which,  coupled
                  with societal  discrimination,  limited  their  employment
                  opportunities.  The law prohibits discrimination  'due  to
                  the fact that the  person  is  male  or  female  or  of  a
                  different appearance  from  his/her  own  sex  by  birth.'
                  There was some commercial discrimination based  on  sexual
                  orientation and gender identity'.

         48.      The same report  later  deals  with  'Discrimination  With
             Respect to Employment  Occupation'  in  relation  to  workers'
             rights in section 7(d) in the following terms:-

                  'Discrimination  with  respect  to   employment   occurred
                  against LGBTI persons, ... Government regulations  require
                  employers to pay equal wages and benefits for equal  work,
                  regardless of  gender.   Union  leaders  stated  the  wage
                  differences for men and women were generally  minimal  and
                  were  mostly  due  to  different   skills,   duration   of
                  employment, types of jobs, as well as legal  requirements,
                  which prohibit the employment of women in  hazardous  work
                  ...

                  Persons  of  diverse  sexual   orientations   and   gender
                  identities faced frequent discrimination in the workplace,
                  partly due to common prejudices and a lack  of  protective
                  laws and policies on discrimination.  A  2014  ILO  report
                  found discrimination  at  all  stages  of  the  employment
                  process, including education and training, access to jobs,
                  advancement opportunities, social  security,  and  partner
                  benefits.   Transgender  workers  reportedly  faced   even
                  greater  constraints,  and  their  participation  in   the
                  workforce was often limited to a few professions, such  as
                  cosmetology and entertainment.'

             When I look at all the evidence before me I am  not  satisfied
             that it is reasonably likely that the Appellant will be at any
             risk of being re-trafficked on her return  to  Thailand.   The
             evidence is simply not there to substantiate  the  Appellant's
             claim.  There is no  medical  evidence  that  she  is  a  very
             vulnerable person.  She has a supportive  family.   I  do  not
             accept it is reasonably likely that she is still  in  debt  to
             those who trafficked her to the United Kingdom.  It  therefore
             follows that she is not  at  real  risk  of  serious  harm  or
             inhuman or degrading treatment should she return to  Thailand.
             There is no evidence that she  would  be  perceived  to  be  a
             lucrative investment for her original  traffickers.   She  was
             able to leave their employment within a relatively short  time
             of her arrival in the United Kingdom with  little  difficulty.
             No effort seems to have neem made to force her  to  return  to
             work during the time she has been  here.   Although  I  accept
             that she may have given evidence against those involved in her
             exploitation in the United Kingdom there is no  evidence  that
             this has caused  her  family  any  difficulties  in  Thailand.
             There is no evidence of  witness  intimidation  and  there  is
             nothing from the authorities in the United Kingdom to  suggest
             that those who were prosecuted (and presumably convicted)  are
             likely to have any influence in Thailand.  The Appellant  will
             of course  have  no  language  difficulties  on  return.   Her
             position can be contrasted with that of the  Appellant  in  AZ
             (Thailand).  The appellant in that case had been abandoned  by
             her mother when she was one year old and had been  brought  up
             by her  paternal  grandparents  (who  had  since  died).   Her
             childhood was described as "deprived and abusive".  She had no
             family  support  and  had  previously  attempted  suicide   in
             Thailand as a result of which she was in hospital for a  week.
             The Upper Tribunal had the benefit of evidence from the  Helen
             Bamber Foundation (who described  the  Appellant  as  a  'very
             distressed young woman').  She was  said  to  have  made  'two
             serious suicide attempts' including one in the United  Kingdom
             and to have 'long history of self  harm'.   She  relied  on  a
             support network in the  UK.   Her  position  is  significantly
             different to that of the current Appellant.  I  also  consider
             that the Appellant will not be at risk  more  generally  as  a
             transgender woman.  The background evidence is  not  there  to
             support  such  a  conclusion  particularly  in  light  of  the
             Appellant's experiences as set out in the record of her asylum
             interview."

25. The assertion that the judge made no findings in relation to her gender
    reassignment and identify is not  sustainable.   It  is  the  practical
    effect that needs to be considered and that is what the judge assessed.
     The findings of the judge in relation to the background material  were
    specifically that:

         "the appellant does not appear to have experienced  any  particular
         difficulties in view of her gender reassignment in Thailand.   When
         asked what problems she had experienced at her asylum interview she
         simply referred to "bad remarks" from neighbours (ASQ 182)"

26. It is implicit and self-evident that the judge concluded that the level
    for persecution had not been reached and that was after considering the
    personal circumstances of the appellant noting that she  would  not  be
    permitted to change her gender on  identification  documents  and  that
    there were some  commercial  and  employment  discrimination  based  on
    sexual orientation and gender identity.  The Thai laws,  as  the  judge
    found,  did  not  criminalise  expression  of  sexual  orientation   or
    consensual same sex conduct between adults.

27. BF (Albania) looked at same sex unions and the right  to  change  one's
    legal gender in Albania and in the context of the homophobic atmosphere
    in Albania.  In that case it was accepted that Albania had not  reached
    the position of equality and in particular the court assessed the level
    of  discrimination  in   Tirana   and   the   discriminatory   measures
    particularly with regard the legal, cultural and social restrictions on
    rights to or ability to enjoy a private and family life.  At paragraphs
    184 and 185 the Tribunal noted that same sex marriage was not  provided
    for  in  Albanian  law  but  there  was  no  evidence  which  prevented
    cohabitation or the transfer of property and it was not suggested  that
    there  were  any  particular  difficulties  regarding   living   in   a
    relationship caused by the lack  of  legal  recognition.   As  such  at
    paragraph 185 it was found that whether in  isolation  or  cumulatively
    even  in  the  homophobic  environment  of  Albania  that  it  was  not
    considered that the level  of  discrimination  on  which  the  evidence
    suggested reached the level of having sufficiently serious consequences
    for the individual and did not  therefore  constitute  persecution.  As
    stated:

         "184.     Marriage  between  two  men  or  its  civil   partnership
         equivalent is not  provided  for  in  Albanian  law.  There  is  no
         evidence that this prevents cohabitation or  couples  making  their
         own arrangements to  ensure,  for  example,  transfer  of  property
         between them. We take note of the fact that Mr Pinderi was able  to
         live in a relationship with another man whilst in  Tirana.   It  is
         not said that they were unable to do so or met with any  particular
         difficulties  in  that  regard  caused  by  the   lack   of   legal
         recognition.

         185.     Whether considered in isolation or cumulatively, we do not
         consider that  the  level  of  discrimination  which  the  evidence
         suggests exists reaches the level of having "sufficiently  serious"
         consequences for the individual and does not  therefore  constitute
         persecution".

28. In line with HJ (Iran) and BF (Albania) the findings by the judge  that
    the appellant "will not be at risk  more  generally  as  a  transgender
    woman" were made and entirely legitimate (paragraph 48).  The judge did
    take into account the cumulative circumstances  and  made  an  informed
    decision.

29. Nowhere in the grounds for permission to  appeal  had  the  appellant's
    representative addressed the  points  on  the  threshold  required  for
    persecution.

30. The findings by the judge at  [50]  whereby  the  judge  dismissed  the
    appellant's claim to international protection and under Articles 2  and
    3 and 8 of the ECHR were without legal error. It is not  arguable  that
    the very exceptional circumstances required for a breach of  Article  3
    in relation to identity  and  same  sex  marriage  have  been  reached.
    Simply the discrimination did  not  reach  the  level  consistent  with
    persecution whether that is in relation to violence or otherwise as per
    Article 9 of the Council Directive 2004/83/EC.

31. In reality, the attack on the determination in  relation  to  the  Thai
    authorities' forcing the appellant to disclose her birth, sex  and  her
    official identity relates to an Article 8 challenge and  as  Mr  Clarke
    pointed out the judge from paragraph 51 onwards carefully assessed  the
    appellant's private life under Article 8 noting that the appellant  had
    lived in Thailand until the age of 23 and that she left in  2014.   The
    judge  applied  paragraph  276ADE  finding  that  there  were  no  very
    significant obstacles  to  her  return  and  that  she  "will  have  no
    difficulty in reintegrating into society in Thailand"  [53].   She  had
    spent her formative life there, had lived there for most her  life  and
    was educated there. As the judge found

         "There should be no cultural barriers to reintegration despite  her
         gender reassignment.  There is no medical evidence that she has any
         health problems which may impact on her ability to integrate.   Her
         mother is still there and should be able to accommodate  her.   She
         has other relatives.  ... the evidence is that she should  be  able
         to resume some form of private life in I do not consider  she  will
         face 'very significant obstacles' (a high test) to reintegration in
         Thailand" [53]

32. None of those findings in relation to Article 8 were challenged.

33. It is correct to state that the judge at paragraph 57 found,

         "The appellant's wish to have a sex change operation in the  UK  is
         expressed in her first statement  although  understandable  is  not
         something which attracts  much  weight  particularly  as  it  would
         appear that this procedure is also available in Thailand albeit  at
         a cost.  Similarly the appellant's inability to  change  her  legal
         identity from male to female in Thailand or to marry a man does not
         assist her."

34. It was, however, open to the judge  to  give  weight  to  the  relevant
    factors and to find that these did not fulfil the requirement of  'very
    significant obstacles' to return and were not capable  of  constituting
    compelling circumstances under the Immigration Rules.  It has long been
    held that the State may control entry into its borders and Article 8 is
    not an unqualified right.  Indeed as set out in Ullah at  paragraph  50
    "where other Articles may become engaged a  high  threshold  test  will
    always have to be satisfied".

35. Finally, turning to the second ground, it was asserted in  the  grounds
    for permission to appeal that the judge had failed to give  reasons  on
    the risk of re-trafficking which was a material error of law.   It  was
    submitted that  further  to  Article  4(4)  of  the  Council  Directive
    2004/83/EC the fact that an  applicant  had  already  been  subject  to
    persecution or serious harm, was a serious indication of a well-founded
    fear of persecution and further to AZ (trafficked  women)  Thailand  CG
    [2010] UKUT 118 at paragraph 150 former  victims  of  trafficking  were
    even more vulnerable.

36. I find the second ground of challenge is not well-founded.   The  judge
    gave comprehensive reasons for finding that it was likely the appellant
    no longer owed a debt to those who trafficked her to the UK.  The judge
    made a series of comprehensive findings specifically  referring  to  AZ
    (trafficked women) and also to AUJ (trafficking no  conclusive  grounds
    of decision) Bangladesh [2018] UKUT 00200 where it  was  held  that  an
    appellant's claim that he was trafficked  or  is  a  victim  of  modern
    slavery in the past may be relevant in reaching a decision  in  whether
    his removal would be a breach under the Refugee Convention.  The  judge
    indeed set out various ways in which that might be the case.

37. At [38] the judge noted that AZ identified that not all will be at risk
    of serious harm on return and the risk would depend on various  factors
    and should be assessed on a case by case basis which  is  exactly  what
    the judge did including the age, marital status,  domestic  background,
    educational level, qualifications and work experience of the appellant.
     The judge outlined the key guidance in  AZ  and  followed  it.   Anti-
    trafficking legislation was implemented in  Thailand  and  yet  it  was
    identified that Thailand was classified as the Tier 2 country  for  the
    purposes of US Trafficking Victims, Protection Act.  However, the judge
    specifically noted that the appellant had  been  previously  trafficked
    and referred to the expert report and identified  that  the  burden  of
    proof was on the appellant to show that she was at real risk on  return
    of serious harm.

38. The judge took into account the background material at  [41]  and  [42]
    which included the creation by Thailand of specialised anti-trafficking
    law enforcement divisions and the prosecution and  conviction  of  more
    traffickers.  That said the judge realised that there were  issues  for
    those who were trafficked to Thailand.  At [43] the judge detailed  his
    reasons for finding  the  appellant  was  no  longer  at  risk  of  re-
    trafficking.  The appellant had given  a  confusing  and  contradictory
    account of the debts she claimed were due not least that she had  never
    produced the contract referred to her  in  her  asylum  interview  even
    though she said that both her mother and she had signed it; to  add  to
    the confusion in her asylum interview she had said that she was in debt
    with W but then in fact it was her mother that had  borrowed  from  him
    and indeed the mother was still in her house which  had  been  said  to
    have been the guarantee.  There was no evidence from  the  mother  [44]
    and there were no  real  efforts  even  if  money  were  owed  to  have
    collected the money by anyone in Thailand.  Indeed, the lender and  the
    appellant had not been in contact for three years  and  there  were  no
    threats.  The judge found that the appellant would have the support  of
    her family when she returns [45] and there was no indication  that  her
    immediate family did not accept her identification as a woman.

39. The judge specifically factored in whether she was vulnerable  in  view
    of her experience as a trafficked woman [46] and gave sound reasons for
    distancing the findings from the matter of the expert report.  For  all
    these reasons together with the findings I have already alluded  to  at
    paragraph 47 and 48, the judge made a specific finding that  she  would
    not be reasonably likely to be at risk of re-trafficking on  return  to
    Thailand and that "the evidence is simply not there to substantiate the
    appellant's claim".  The judge found the appellant was "able  to  leave
    their employment within a relatively short time of her arrival  in  the
    United Kingdom with little difficulty.  No effort seems  to  have  been
    made to force her to return to work during the time she has been here".
     ... "there is no evidence of witness intimidation and there is nothing
    from the authorities in the United Kingdom to suggest  that  those  who
    were prosecuted (and presumably  convicted)  are  likely  to  have  any
    influence in Thailand.

40. The judge detailed  why  this  case  was  different  from  that  of  AZ
    (Thailand) and, concluded for the sound reasons identified  above  that
    the appellant could not avail herself of  international  protection  on
    the basis of being re-trafficked.

41. For the reasons I have given I am not  persuaded  that  there  was  any
    material error of law in the decision and the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Cary shall stand.



Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
