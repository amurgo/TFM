Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr A Pipe (Counsel)
For the Respondent:    Mr I Richards (Senior HOPO)


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Parkes, promulgated on 8th October 2014, following a  hearing  at
    Birmingham Sheldon Court on 15th September 2014.  In the determination,
    the judge dismissed the appeal of Yaying He, who  subsequently  applied
    for, and was granted, permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal,  and
    thus the matter comes before me.

The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a female, a citizen of China, who  was  born  on  15th
    September 1974.  She appealed against the decision  of  the  Respondent
    Secretary of State refusing her application for asylum, although at the
    hearing before Judge Parkes the appeal  was  pursued  solely  on  human
    rights grounds, the basis being that the Appellant  wished  to  have  a
    family life with her husband in the UK.

The Judge's Findings

 3. The judge  observed  how  the  Appellant's  husband  had  been  granted
    indefinite leave to remain in 2010 on  the  basis  of  exceptional  and
    compassionate circumstances (see paragraph 5).  The judge also observed
    that the Appellant could  not  bring  herself  within  the  Immigration
    Rules, "it seems to me to be appropriate to  consider  the  Rules  that
    relate to spouses by analogy" (paragraph 11).  Consideration was  given
    to Section 117 of the 2002 Act,  and  on  this  basis  the  appeal  was
    dismissed.  Although the Appellant's  husband  had  ILR  this  did  not
    oblige him to remain in the UK and he could relocate with the Appellant
    to China.

Grounds of Application

 4. The grounds of application state that the judge failed to give adequate
    reasons on material matters.  This is because, given that the Secretary
    of State had concluded that the  Appellant's  husband  merited  settled
    status because of his exceptional and  compelling  circumstances,  that
    this was a factor that should be weighed in  the  balance  in  deciding
    whether it was reasonable to expect the Appellant's husband to relocate
    to China with the Appellant.  Second, the fact that the Appellant spoke
    Mandarin at home, but wished to use an interpreter at the hearing,  did
    not mean that she did not  have  the  ability  to  communicate  in  the
    English language.  Finally, the  judge  failed  to  consider  that  the
    Appellant was not going to be a burden  on  the  state,  and  that  the
    existence of the two children did not mean that  the  income  threshold
    would be raised still further because of the application.

 5. On 22nd October 2014, permission to  appeal  was  granted  on  entirely
    different grounds, leaving all grounds to be argued nonetheless.

 6. On 12th November 2014 a Rule 24 response was entered by  the  Secretary
    of State.

Submissions

 7. At the hearing before me on 27th August 2015,  Mr  Pipe,  appearing  on
    behalf of the Appellant relied upon  the  Grounds  of  Appeal  and  the
    skeleton argument drafted by Mr  Vokes  of  Counsel,  as  the  previous
    representative of the Appellant.

 8. First, Mr Pipe submitted that the  judge  had  misdirected  himself  by
    stating that, "although by virtue of the nature of her entry to the  UK
    and continued presence the Appellant cannot bring  herself  within  the
    Immigration Rules it seems to me to  be  appropriate  to  consider  the
    Rules that relate to spouses  by  analogy"  (paragraph  11).   This  is
    because the Secretary of State herself considered the application under
    EX1, and the applicability of the ten year route to settled status, and
    this was made clear  in  the  skeleton  argument  at  paragraph  1  and
    paragraph 2.  It was not the case that the Appellant  could  not  bring
    herself within the Immigration Rules.

 9. Second, the main challenge here was the way in which  the  judge  dealt
    with the Article 8 application outside the  Rules.   This  was  a  case
    where the husband had  been  granted  ILR  in  2010  on  the  basis  of
    exceptional and compassionate circumstances.  The judge states that, "I
    have not been told what these are or may be ..." (paragraph  5).   This
    was untrue.  This is because even the refusal letter acknowledged  what
    these exceptional and compassionate circumstances  were.   The  refusal
    letter stated that, "due to his length of residence in the  UK".   Yet,
    the judge had  appeared  to  indicate  that  these  circumstances  were
    unknown (see paragraph 5).

10. Third, the judge concludes that  the  Appellant  could  live  with  the
    husband in China observing that, "while the Appellant's husband has ILR
    on an unclear basis but clearly not  connected  with  circumstances  in
    China he is entitled to live in the UK if he  wishes,  but  he  is  not
    obliged to do  so"  (paragraph  14).   This  conclusion  could  not  be
    properly reached given the exceptional nature of the  manner  in  which
    the ILR was granted to the husband.  It could also not be reached given
    the jurisprudence in Beoku-Betts by the House  of  Lords  which  stated
    that it was important to look at the  rights  of  people  who  are  not
    subject to removal, such as the Appellant's husband in this  case,  who
    would want to live in this  country,  having  acquired  settled  status
    here.

11. Finally,  the  judge  had  erred  in  his  evaluation  of  Section  117
    considerations of public interest when he observed that,  "relevant  to
    this and Section 117B is the fact that the Appellant does not  have  an
    English language test certificate and still prefers to  communicate  in
    her own language.  That itself indicates a lack of  integration  within
    society ..." (paragraph 11).  This was to overstretch the provisions of
    Section 117.  Those provisions do not suggest this at all.

12. For his part, Mr Richards submitted  that,  whilst  he  recognised  the
    deficiencies in the determination, nevertheless,  it  was  possible  to
    rescue it because the judge had referred to Section 117 of the 2002 Act
    as required.   The  judge  was  entitled  to  say  that,  although  the
    Appellant's husband had acquired ILR, this did not  mean  that  he  was
    obliged to remain in the UK.  Finally, the judge did consider Article 8
    in an appropriate fashion because at paragraph 15, when he states that,
    "I find there are no  compelling  or  compassionate  circumstances"  or
    that, "I find that the Appellant's removal would not  be  unjustifiably
    harsh in the circumstances" (see paragraph 15) what the judge was doing
    was applying the "proportionality" considerations.

Error of Law

13. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by the judge did involve
    the making of an error on a point of law (see  Section  12(1)  of  TCEA
    2007) such that I should set aside the decision.   My  reasons  are  as
    follows.  First, it is not true that  the  Appellant  could  not  bring
    herself within the Immigration Rules because the refusal letter plainly
    recognises that the Immigration Rules were applicable to the Appellant,
    given the reference to EX1.  Second,  it  is  incorrect  to  say  that,
    whilst ILR was given to the Appellant's husband in 2010 on the basis of
    exceptional and compassionate circumstances, that the Tribunal was  not
    aware what the basis  of  this  was,  given  that  the  refusal  letter
    recognised that this was "due to his length of residence  in  the  UK".
    Third, the judge makes a finding (at paragraph 8) that the  Appellant's
    husband earns ï¿½18,200 a year.  Given this, it was  wrong  to  transpose
    the spouse's Immigration  Rules  (see  paragraph  11)  in  relation  to
    Section 117B of the 2002 Act, and the need for financial  independence.
    All that the family had to show was  there  would  be  no  recourse  to
    public funds.

14. Finally, and most importantly, the fact that  the  Appellant's  husband
    had been granted  ILR  on  the  basis  of  exceptional  and  compelling
    circumstances, meant that this fact in itself  had  to  be  weighed  in
    account in considering  the  reasonableness  of  relocation  to  China,
    especially in the light of Beoku-Betts' decision in the House of Lords,
    which does require specific regard to be given to the rights of  family
    members, other than the Appellant subject to removal.

15. The effect of the error has been to deprive the  Appellant  of  a  fair
    hearing or an opportunity for the Appellant's case to be put and to  be
    considered  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  such  that  under  Practice
    Statement 7.2(a) I conclude that the appropriate course  of  action  is
    for this matter to be remitted  back  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  in
    Birmingham Sheldon Court, to be determined by a judge other than  Judge
    Parkes.

Notice of Decision

16. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    of law such that it falls to be set aside.  I set aside the decision of
    the original judge.  I remake the decision as follows.  This appeal  is
    remitted back de novo to the First-tier Tribunal in Birmingham  Sheldon
    Court, to be determined by  a  judge  other  than  Judge  Parkes  under
    Practice Statement 7.2(a).

17. No anonymity order is made.
