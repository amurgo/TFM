                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background

 1. The appellants in this case  are  mother  and  daughter  and  both  are
    citizens of Pakistan.  The first appellant was born on 3 February  1984
    and the second appellant on 8 August 2010.

 2. The history of this case is that the sponsor entered the UK in 2006  as
    the spouse of a Ms Yasmin Aktar, whom he married in Pakistan  in  2003.
    The sponsor was granted indefinite leave to remain in the UK in  August
    2008.  The information indicates that the appellant separated  from  Ms
    Aktar in October 2008 and there was a religious divorce in  July  2009.
    It is not disputed that Mr Ghafar entered  into  a  religious  marriage
    with the first  appellant  in  Pakistan  in  October  2009.   Ms  Aktar
    commenced divorce proceedings in the UK and a decree absolute was  made
    on 3 March 2011.

 3. The appellants originally applied to  join  Mr  Ghafar  in  the  UK  in
    October 2012.  That application was refused on 10 December 2012 on  the
    grounds that the marriage between Mr  and  Mrs  Ghafar  was  not  valid
    because at the date of that marriage in Pakistan Mr  Ghafar's  marriage
    to Ms Aktar had not yet  been  dissolved  according  to  UK  law.   The
    appellants appealed.  In a decision promulgated  on  11  November  2013
    Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal  Thanki  dismissed  the  appellants'
    appeals.  The appellants appealed with permission to the Upper Tribunal
    and in a decision promulgated on 23 April 2014 Upper Tribunal Judge  C.
    Lane dismissed the appeal to the Upper Tribunal.  The  appellants  then
    made further applications for  leave  to  enter  in  May  2015.   Those
    applications were refused in decisions dated 13 August  2015.    It  is
    the appeal against those decisions which form the basis of the  appeals
    before me.

 4. The appeals came before the First-tier Tribunal on 8 February 2016.  In
    a decision dated 11 May 2016 Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Behan
    dismissed the appellants' appeals under the Immigration Rules and under
    Article 8.

 5. The appellants appealed with permission to the Upper  Tribunal  on  the
    following grounds:

    Ground 1 - Domicile

 6. It was argued that the judge of the First-tier Tribunal  erred  in  his
    consideration and findings that the sponsor was domiciled in the UK  in
    2009 and therefore the judge was not satisfied that his marriage to the
    first  appellant  was  valid  (it  essentially  being  the  appellants'
    argument that at the time  of  the  sponsor's  marriage  to  the  first
    appellant Mr Ghafar was domiciled in Pakistan and polygamous  marriages
    are legal there).

    Ground 2 - Fianc�e

 7. It was noted that Judge  Behan  accepted,  at  paragraph  [29]  of  the
    decision and reasons, that the application and sponsor  did  intend  to
    marry in the UK but at [30] stated that in her view the  appellant  had
    not formed the intention to marry in the UK.  The First-tier Judge went
    on at [31] to again accept that both parties intended to marry  in  the
    UK upon the appellant's arrival.  It was submitted that these  findings
    were inconsistent.







    Ground 3 - Article 8

 8. It  was  submitted  that  Judge  Behan  had  erred  in  dismissing  the
    appellants' appeal  under  Article  8  on  the  basis  that  a  further
    application as a fianc�e could be made.

Error of Law

Ground 2

 9. The respondent's Rule 24, although it addressed the issue  of  domicile
    and, in terms, Article  8,  was  silent  in  relation  to  the  claimed
    inconsistency in the judge's  findings.   Mr  Armstrong  conceded  that
    there appeared to be inconsistencies but submitted that any  error  was
    not material to the judge's findings.

10. Mr Nasim submitted that the judge was incorrect in stating as  she  did
    at paragraph [30], that:

         "In my view the appellant has not shown that, at the  time  of  the
         application or decision, she had formed the intention to marry  the
         appellant in the UK, the position was she was waiting to  see  what
         happened  with  her  application  and  would  revisit  the   matter
         depending on the outcome.  For this reason it would not be accurate
         to describe her as a fianc�e at the  time  of  the  application  or
         decision."

11. However the judge at [29] had indicated that the sponsor had said  that
    in relation to marriage in the UK "if need be he will  do  so"  and  "I
    accept this and there is no reason  to  consider  the  first  appellant
    feels any differently".  The judge then went on at  paragraph  [31]  of
    the determination to find:

         "I do not share the ECO's doubt that the appellant  would  enter  a
         civil marriage if granted leave for this purpose however.  I gained
         the strong impression that Mr Ghaffar will do whatever is  required
         to be able to live in the UK with  his  family  and  just  wants  a
         solution to the frustrating position he is in.  It is correct  that
         he considers married Islamically but  I  am  satisfied  he  has  no
         principled objection to marrying in a UK registry office and  there
         is no reason to think Mrs Ghafar has  any  such  objection  either.
         Having made two applications and pursued three appeals  I  consider
         it highly unlikely the sponsor and Mr Ghafar would jeopardise their
         position by not having a civil wedding."

12. The judge found however at [32] that all  this  did  not  amount  to  a
    finding that the first appellant "could properly be  considered  to  be
    the appellant's fianc�e at the time of the decision"  and  it  was  the
    judge's findings that an application to enter the UK to get married "if
    necessary" does not meet the requirements of paragraph E-ECP2.8.

13. Paragraph E-ECP2.8 of Appendix FM provides as follows:

         "Relationship requirements...

         E-ECP2.8. If the applicant is a fianc�e or proposed  civil  partner
         they must be seeking entry to the UK to enable  their  marriage  or
         civil partnership to take place."

14. I am not satisfied that Judge Behan gave adequate reasons  as  to  why,
    what she had already accepted as both the appellant and  the  sponsor's
    intention to get married in the UK if necessary,  could  not  meet  the
    requirements of E-ECP2.8.

15. In my view the wording of the relevant provision  assists  rather  than
    hinders the first appellant.  The first appellant only intended to be a
    fianc�e if necessary (as their first contention was  that  the  sponsor
    had been domiciled in Pakistan at the relevant time and therefore  they
    were already legally married).  However, the second application to  the
    respondent in May 2015, quite clearly in the online application and  in
    the covering letter from the appellants' representatives,  stated  that
    the first appellant was applying "as a spouse, and in  the  alternative
    as a common law partner or fianc�e, if appropriate".   The  appellants'
    bundle, at page 20, shows at  question  1.6  of  the  application,  the
    appellant, when asked whether she was seeking permission to come to the
    UK as a fianc�e, ticked 'yes'.  In the explanatory  box  the  appellant
    stated "only if validity of marriage is not accepted.   I  believe  our
    marriage is valid and if not then we will marry at a registry office in
    the UK".  I considered the comprehensive covering letter and supporting
    information provided in support of the appellants'  application.   This
    included, under the paragraph headed "finance" that:

         "The couple are willing to have a civil marriage in the  UK  should
         this be deemed necessary.  Obviously no arrangements  can  be  made
         with regards the marriage pending your decision.  Furthermore,  you
         will  be  aware  that  registrars  do  not  make  arrangements  for
         marriages until they have seen both parties in person and they have
         provided evidence regarding their nationality and identity.   These
         arrangements can only be made once Ms Ghafar is in the UK.  All the
         other requirements under the Rules are exactly the same."

16. I also had the  benefit  of  sight  of  the  respondent's  guidance  in
    relation to fianc�es, published on 6 July  2012.   At  paragraph  8  in
    relation to decisions on the intention to live together, this relies on
    1996 findings of Keen J that "the concept of intention is  no  doubt  a
    complex one, but it appears to me that one can indeed  have  a  genuine
    intention, notwithstanding that the carrying out of that  intention  is
    dependent on, or could be frustrated by, some extraneous  event".   The
    respondent's guidance goes on to set out that the requirements  of  the
    immigration rules relating to the  intention  of  the  parties  to  the
    marriage could be met where the British  citizen  or  legally  resident
    foreign national spouse insisted on remaining  in  the  UK.   In  other
    words a conditional intention to live together could be  sufficient  to
    meet the "intention to live together permanently" requirement.

17. I am satisfied that an intention to marry in the UK,  if  required,  is
    analogous to this.  The fact that the first appellant's  intention  was
    conditional on her not being successful in her primary  application  to
    enter as a spouse (dependent on the decision in relation  to  domicile)
    does not frustrate her intention to marry, if necessary.

18. At paragraph 18 of the respondent's guidance it is stated that the  ECO
    needs to be satisfied that it is intended that a  marriage  in  the  UK
    will take place and that paragraph confirms that the law in relation to
    marriage does not allow for arrangements to be made until  the  foreign
    national has arrived  in  the  UK.   It  continues  that  the  ECO  can
    reasonably expect the couple to have made some tentative plans for  the
    wedding and that any  evidence  that  may  be  available  that  wedding
    arrangements are in hand may help in this respect.  However, I  am  not
    satisfied that it is fatal in this case that such "tentative" plans had
    not been made, given that the intention was conditional on the  outcome
    of the ECO's decision as  to  whether  the  sponsor  was  domiciled  in
    Pakistan and whether therefore the 2009 marriage was valid.

19. In addition, both parties need to  be  present  in  person  to  make  a
    booking for marriage and given these twin factors, both of the need for
    the first appellant's presence in the UK and also that the parties were
    awaiting the ECO's decision  in  relation  to  the  validity  of  their
    marriage, I do not consider that any adverse inference can be  attached
    to their failure to make any further plans for the marriage.

20. Judge Behan's findings accepted that the parties intended to  marry  in
    the UK if necessary.  That event having become necessary, following the
    ECO's refusal  of  the  parties'  contention  that  they  were  validly
    married, the judge erred in  placing  an  additional  hurdle  that  the
    intention to come to the UK as a fianc�e had, in effect,  to  be  stand
    alone.

21. The ECO, having first of all rejected the first appellant's  contention
    that they were validly married, ought  to  have  considered  the  clear
    intention, stated by both parties and found to be  the  case  by  Judge
    Behan, that they  would  marry.   The  ECO's  decision  that  the  2009
    marriage was invalid in effect turned the appellant's application  into
    one as a fianc�e, in the terms required under E-ECP2.8, given both  her
    and the sponsor's prior stated intentions  (accepted  by  Judge  Behan)
    that that would be the case.  I am satisfied therefore on  the  correct
    interpretation of Judge Behan's  findings  that  the  appellant's  case
    falls to be allowed.  It was not disputed that the second appellant  is
    dependent on the first and her case also falls to be allowed.

Grounds 1 and 3

22. Mr Nasim did not pursue the first and third grounds before me  and  was
    content to rely on ground 2.  That in my view is the correct  approach.
    The judge's findings in relation to domicile cannot be faulted and were
    clearly open to her.  Similarly, I share the view of the Upper Tribunal
    Judge who  granted  permission  that  there  is  little  merit  in  the
    appellants' Article 8 point as the parties had lived  apart  for  years
    and the sponsor  could  live  with  the  appellant.   However  that  is
    academic given that I am satisfied that the appeals fall to be  allowed
    under the Immigration Rules.





Notice of Decision

23. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal Behan contains a material error
    of law such  that  her  decision  to  dismiss  the  appeals  under  the
    Immigration Rules is set aside.  I substitute my  decision  to  re-make
    the appeals allowing them under the Immigration Rules.

No anonymity direction was requested in this  case.   Although  one  of  the
appellants is a minor there are no identifying features in the decision  and
I do not consider such a direction necessary in this case.
