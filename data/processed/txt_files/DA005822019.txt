For the Appellant:     Mr McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr J Metzer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. I shall refer to the appellant as the 'respondent' and  the  respondent
    as the 'appellant', as they appeared respectively before the First-tier
    Tribunal. The appellant was born in 1975 and is a citizen of Poland. He
    was convicted  on  12  August  2019  of  damaging  property  so  as  to
    recklessly endanger life (he interfered with the braking system of  his
    wife's motor car) and was sentenced to  39  months'  imprisonment.  The
    Secretary of State made a deportation order in respect of the appellant
    on 25 November 2019. The appellant appealed to the First-tier  Tribunal
    which, in a decision promulgated  on  13  November  2020,  allowed  the
    appeal. The Secretary of State now appeals,  with  permission,  to  the
    Upper Tribunal.

 2. The grounds cite Schedule 1 (2-4) of the Immigration (EEA)  Regulations
    2016 in support of the submission that the was wrong in law by  finding
    that the appellant's integrative links to the United  Kingdom  had  not
    been severed by his imprisonment:

         2.   An EEA national or the family member of an EEA national having
         extensive familial and societal links  with  persons  of  the  same
         nationality or language does  not  amount  to  integration  in  the
         United Kingdom; a significant degree of wider cultural and societal
         integration must be present before a  person  may  be  regarded  as
         integrated in the United Kingdom.

         3.   Where an EEA national or the family member of an EEA  national
         has received a custodial sentence, or is a persistent offender, the
         longer the sentence, or the  more  numerous  the  convictions,  the
         greater the likelihood that the individual's continued presence  in
         the United Kingdom represents a genuine, present  and  sufficiently
         serious threat affecting of the fundamental interests of society.

         4.   Little weight is to be attached to the integration of  an  EEA
         national or the family member of an EEA national within the  United
         Kingdom if the alleged integrating links were formed at  or  around
         the same time as-

               a) the commission of a criminal offence;

               b) an act otherwise affecting the  fundamental  interests  of
                  society;

               c) the EEA national or family member of an EEA  national  was
                  in custody.

 3. The Secretary of State contends that the judge failed to give  adequate
    reasons for finding that the appellant is integrated into life  in  the
    United Kingdom such that his imprisonment did not sever his integrative
    links. The appellant has been resident  in  the  United  Kingdom  since
    2005. The judge found that the appellant was  entitled  to  the  higher
    level of protection afforded by regulation  27(4)  of  the  Immigration
    (EEA) Regulations 2016:

         (4)  A relevant decision may not be taken except on imperative
         grounds of public security in   respect of an EEA national who-

               a) has resided in the United Kingdom for a continuous  period
                  of at least ten years prior to the relevant decision;

 4. The Secretary of State's grounds do not seek to argue that  the  appeal
    should have been dismissed if the  judge  had  been  correct  to  apply
    'imperative grounds of public security'. Paragraph [6] of  the  grounds
    argues that the an assessment of proportionality on the  basis  of  the
    lesser level of protection (serious grounds of public policy) would, on
    the facts, have resulted in the appeal being dismissed.

 5. The Court of Appeal in Hussein  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department  [2020]  EWCA  Civ  156  considered  the   recent   European
    authorities MG (Portugal) C-400/12,  B  v  Land  Baden-Wï¿½rttemberg  (C-
    316/16). The latter authority held at [83]:

         83.  In the light of all the foregoing, the  answer  to  the  first
         three questions in  Case  C:316/16  is  that  Article  28(3)(a)  of
         Directive 2004/38 must be interpreted as meaning that, in the  case
         of a Union citizen who is serving a custodial sentence and  against
         whom an expulsion decision is  adopted,  the  condition  of  having
         'resided in the host Member State for the previous ten  years  laid
         down in that provision may be satisfied where an overall assessment
         of the person's situation, taking into  account  all  the  relevant
         aspects,  leads  to  the  conclusion  that,  notwithstanding   that
         detention, the integrative links between the person  concerned  and
         the host Member State have not been broken. Those aspects  include,
         inter alia, the strength of the integrative links forged  with  the
         host Member State before the detention of the person concerned, the
         nature of the offence that resulted  in  the  period  of  detention
         imposed, the circumstances in which that offence was committed  and
         the conduct of  the  person  concerned  throughout  the  period  of
         detention.

    In his submissions, Mr Metzer stressed the  evidential  basis  for  the
    judge's findings at [18] that the 13 months  which  the  appellant  had
    spent in prison failed to sever  the  integrative  links  to  the  host
    nation forged over 15 years since 2005. The factual matrix included the
    appellant's extensive business activities (as shown by his tax  returns
    and other documents), his property ownership (he continued to  pay  the
    mortgages on these properties even when in prison), his completion of a
    course in Mathematics. Whilst the  judge  notes  that  the  appellant's
    father lives in the United Kingdom, I  accept  Mr  Metzer's  submission
    that the evidence which the judge accepted shows that  the  appellant's
    relationships  with  individuals  in  the  United  Kingdom   were   not
    restricted to Polish nationals  living  here;  it  is  clear  that  his
    activities, both social and business, have taken  place  in  the  wider
    community of Manchester where he has lived.  I  accept  also  that  the
    sentencing  judge  acknowledged  that,  notwithstanding  his  offending
    towards them, the appellant has sought to re-establish contact with his
    daughter. I find that the judge did not play down  the  seriousness  of
    the appellant's offending which he addresses in some detail at  [20-21]
    nor did he ignore elements of the  appellant's  conduct  following  the
    commission of his offence which might impact negatively on his claim of
    continued integration (eg. his lack of remorse or acceptance of guilt).
    Mr Metzer's skeleton argument asserts more than once that the fact  the
    judge did not refer in terms to Schedule 1 was not in itself  an  error
    of law but I do not consider that the Secretary of State advances  that
    argument. Rather, the respondent argues that the judge failed to  'have
    regard' to that provision. Having considered the decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal as a whole and  having  been  helpfully  directed  by  Mr
    Metzer to the evidence of the appellant's life in  the  United  Kingdom
    which was before the judge, I am satisfied that the judge  has  reached
    findings which were not at odds with the jurisprudence (Hussain) or the
    proper application of the provisions of Schedule 1. In  short,  it  was
    not perverse on the particular facts for the judge  to  find  that  the
    appellant's links to his host  nation  had  not  been  severed  by  his
    imprisonment.  The  judge  reached  those  findings  having  regard  to
    relevant evidence whilst he did not give weight to irrelevant  matters.
    Whilst another judge may have reached a different outcome, that is  not
    the point. I can identify no  reason  to  interfere  with  the  judge's
    analysis. Consequently, the  appellant  was  entitled  to  the  higher,
    'imperative' level of protection of which his offending and  subsequent
    imprisonment have not  deprived  him.  Accordingly,  the  Secretary  of
    State's appeal is dismissed.

    The Secretary of State's appeal is dismissed.
