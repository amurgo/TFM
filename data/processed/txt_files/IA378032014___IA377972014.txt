Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr I. Khan of Lincolns Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr T. Wilding, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    The appellants appealed against the  respondent's  decision  dated  03
    September 2014 to refuse the first appellant leave to remain as a  Tier
    1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant with the second appellant  as  his  dependent.
    The respondent was not satisfied that the first appellant satisfied the
    evidential requirements contained in paragraph 41-SD(c)(i) (letter from
    financial institution holding the funds) or  paragraph  41-SD(c)(ii)(4)
    (bank statement for money  held  in  the  UK)  of  Appendix  A  of  the
    immigration rules.

2.    In a decision promulgated on 30 April 2015 First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Hodgkinson dismissed the appeal for the following reasons:

    (i)    The appellants'  legal  representative  (Mr  M.  Iqbal,  counsel
         instructed by Accident Lawyers) conceded that not all the specified
         documents had been provided and the appellants could not  therefore
         satisfy the requirements of the immigration rules.

    (ii)   Although the judge accepted that the appellant  was  a  credible
         witness who ran  a  business  in  the  UK  he  concluded  that  the
         appellants right to private and family life was not engaged on  the
         particular facts of this case and that there were no compelling  or
         exceptional    circumstances    that    rendered    the    decision
         disproportionate under Article 8 of the European Convention.

3.    The  appellants  were  granted  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal. They seek to appeal the First-tier Tribunal decision  on  the
    following grounds:

    (i)    The First-tier Tribunal Judge erred in not  considering  whether
         the appellants did in fact meet the requirements of the immigration
         rules despite the  incorrect  concession  made  by  their  previous
         representative.

    (ii)   The First-tier Tribunal  should  have  considered  the  relevant
         provisions contained in paragraph 41-SD and the evidence  submitted
         with the application. It is argued  that  the  appellants  met  the
         requirements of those provisions and the respondent considered  the
         wrong provisions.

Decision and reasons

4.    After having considered the grounds of appeal and oral arguments I  am
    not satisfied that the First-tier Tribunal decision involved the making
    of an error on a point of law.

5.    The appellant applied to vary his leave to remain to that of a Tier  1
    (Entrepreneur) Migrant with his wife as his dependent. He was  required
    to show that he had access to funds of not less than  �50,000  for  the
    purpose of Table 4 of Appendix A. Paragraph 41-SD of Appendix  FM  sets
    out the requirements for specified evidence needed to  support  of  the
    application. The appellant submitted the following  evidence  with  the
    application:

    (i)    A declaration of availability of third party funds made  by  the
         appellant's brother (Abdul  Razique)  stating  that  there  was  an
         available balance of �28,549.80 in his account.

    (ii)   A "customer snapshot" in his brother's name  from  the  Bank  of
         Montreal confirming the balances in various accounts.

    (iii)  A copy of his brother's passport.

    (iii)  A letter from Standard Chartered Bank (not on  headed  notepaper
         albeit endorsed with a stamp) confirming that the appellant's other
         brother (Bari Dad) had 6,000,000 rupees available in his account.

    (iv)   A declaration of availability of third party funds made  by  the
         appellant's brother and accompanying affidavit.

6.    The appellant was therefore relying wholly on third party  funds  held
    in accounts outside the UK. At the date  of  application  the  relevant
    evidential requirements for the purpose of paragraph 41-SD of  Appendix
    FM were as follows:

    (1)     A  letter  in  a  specified  format  and  providing   specified
         information from each financial institution holding the  funds,  to
         confirm the amount of money available (paragraph 41-SD(c))

    (2)    If the applicant was using money from a third party, he also had
         to provide all of the following specified documents in addition  to
         those specified in sub-paragraph (c) (paragraph 41-SD(d)):

         (i)      An original written declaration  from  every  third  party
             that they have  made  the  money  available  to  invest  in  a
             business in the United Kingdom containing a list of  specified
             information.

         (ii)     A letter from a legal representative  who  is  independent
             from  the  third  party  containing  a   list   of   specified
             information.

7.    The  respondent  refused  the  application  on  the  ground  that  the
    appellant had failed to produce a letter from the Bank of  Montreal  to
    confirm the level of  the  funds  and  he  therefore  didn't  meet  the
    requirements of paragraph 41-SD(c)(i). It is clear  from  the  evidence
    that was submitted with the application that this document was missing.
    Although the appellant later gave evidence at the appeal to say that he
    had difficulties in obtaining such a document there is no  evidence  to
    suggest  that  any  representations  were  made   with   the   original
    application to ask the respondent to consider exercising discretion  in
    relation to that matter.

8.    The respondent also refused the application on  the  ground  that  the
    bank statement produced did not meet the requirements of paragraph  41-
    SD(c)(ii)(4) of Appendix FM. I agree with Mr Khan's submission that the
    respondent was wrong to consider that paragraph  because  it  is  clear
    from the wording that sub-paragraph (c)(ii) relates to "money  held  in
    the UK only" and therefore  didn't  apply  in  this  case  because  the
    appellant was relying on third party funds held outside the UK.

9.    However, what is clear is that the evidence submitted  in  support  of
    the original application fell far  short  of  what  was  required.  The
    appellant did not produce  a  letter  from  the  Bank  of  Montreal  as
    required by paragraph 41-SD(c)(i) and the respondent  could  hardly  be
    criticised for failing to exercise discretion if she had not been asked
    to do so. It seems that the application also fell short in the  absence
    of letters from legal representatives in both countries that  contained
    the  specified  information  required  to  meet  the  requirements   of
    paragraph 41-SD(d)(ii) of Appendix FM.

10.   Due to the evidential restrictions contained in  section  85A  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, as it applied at the date
    of  the  hearing,  the  First-tier  Tribunal   was   constrained   from
    considering any evidence that  was  not  submitted  with  the  original
    application.  As  such  the  concession   made   by   the   appellant's
    representative at the hearing was properly made because it seems  clear
    that not all the specified documents were included  with  the  original
    application.

11.   Mr  Khan  argued  that  the  respondent  should  have  considered  the
    evidential flexibility requirements and cited the recent Supreme  Court
    decision in Mandalia v SSHD [2015] UKSC 59. That case  related  to  the
    application of the previous Home Office policy relating  to  evidential
    flexibility but at the date of this application  the  policy  had  been
    incorporated into the immigration rules by way of paragraph 245AA.  The
    rule only obliges the respondent to contact the  applicant  in  certain
    circumstances, which only includes missing documents from a  series  or
    if a specified document is not quite in  a  certain  format.  Paragraph
    245AA does not oblige the respondent to  contact  the  applicant  where
    specified documents are simply missing.

12.   For the reasons given above the concession that  the  appellant  could
    not meet the strict evidential requirements of  the  immigration  rules
    was properly made by the appellant's representative at the hearing  and
    the First-tier Tribunal Judge was entitled to rely on that  concession.
    There is no challenge to the First-tier Tribunal's findings in relation
    to Article 8.

DECISION

The First-tier Tribunal decision did not involve the making of an  error  on
a point of law
