Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr I Richards, Senior Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr A Eaton, Counsel, instructed by Hoole & Co


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   In this decision the Appellant is  referred  to  as  the  Secretary  of
    State and the Respondent is referred as the Claimant.  The Claimant,  a
    national of Iraq, made an asylum claim as part of  an  application  for
    further leave to remain in the United Kingdom.  That application of  18
    October 2013 was refused on 8 April 2015.

2.   His appeal against that decision came before First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    Loughridge who, on 30 September 2015, dismissed the appeal  on  Refugee
    Convention and protection grounds and Articles 2 and 3 ECHR but allowed
    the appeal under Article 8 ECHR.

3.   The Claimant was  given  permission  to  appeal  that  decision  on  24
    November 2015 and on 22 June 2016 I granted permission to the Secretary
    of State to cross-appeal in  respect  of  the  decision  to  allow  the
    Claimant's appeal under Article 8 ECHR grounds.

4.   As I indicated then, there was a lack  explanation  why  such  a  claim
    under Article 8 was engaged outside of the Rules but that  the  outcome
    of the full appeal might not be materially different.

5.   On 8 December 2016 I considered submissions made by the Claimant  which
    were  particularly  related  to  the  issue  of   sectarian   violence.
    TheClaimnt was a Sunni Muslim  of  Kurdish  origin  from  the  area  of
    Baghdad.

6.   The Claimant indicated that he would  be  targeted  for  being  a  non-
    Muslim and that Isis would have no mercy upon him.

7.    The  Claimant  indicated  that  his  fundamental  views  were  against
    sectarian violence, that he would be unable to live  his  life  without
    making his political position clear.   He  would  not  wish  to  do  so
    privately, he would not wish to live pretending to be passively a  Shia
    when confronted by the authorities, nor  a  Sunni  when  confronted  by
    Sunnis.  He did not want to associate with one group against another in
    return for protection and he did not approve  or  support  the  Islamic
    basis of the political regime in Iraq.  As such, he was turning against
    the change that has politically marked  the  new  government  of  Iraq;
    which had been clearly more Muslim Shia based.  The  Claimant,  it  was
    accepted, had no basis to be in the Kurdish region of Iraq,  had  never
    been there and had no one there by way of family or social network  who
    could, as it were, offer any alternative.

8.   In the circumstances, Mr Richards submitted that on the  basis  of  the
    case law, of HJ (Iran) [2010] 1AC 596, and  supporting  case  law,  the
    Claimant had made out a basis for seeking such protection.

9.   There was ultimately no adverse decision on the Claimant's  credibility
    made by Judge Loughridge. The Secretary of  State  had  not  challenged
    findings that the judge had made about the Claimant's political beliefs

 10. In support of the asylum claim I was also  provided  with  the  current
    COIR on Iraq and the security situation there. The  report  in  general
    terms confirms the existence of Shia attacks and to some extent violent
    Sunni extremists targeting people in Baghdad.

11.  The Home Office Country Information on  Sunnis  dated  14  August  2016
    provides a generally depressing picture of the level  of  violence  and
    uncertainty that exists and the full  extent  of  internally  displaced
    persons. The information is no basis for any optimism.

12.  The country information .18  August 2016 states  in  relation  to  Shia
    Muslims and militia groups were' ... historically seen as more  capable
    than their Sunni insurgent counterparts and  tended  to  use  far  more
    technologically advanced methods of attack.AAH ( Assab  Ahi  al-Haqaah)
    were also held responsible for some of the most high profile kidnapping
    operations in Iraq including that of five  British  nationals  abducted
    from the Ministry of Finance in  Bagdad  in  May  2007.   Shia  militia
    conducted their respective campaigns against the  backdrop of a dynamic
    political agenda driven by Iran who utilised the militias  as  a  proxy
    force in Iraq against  the  coalition  force  presence'.  As  such,  it
    continued

         'shia campaigns against the backdrop of  dynamic  political  agenda
         were driven by Iran who utilised the militia.  As such Shia militia
         were historically focused on  attacks  targeting  coalition  forces
         using conventional IEDs.  ...  Shia militia also maintain  a  heavy
         presence on the  streets  of  Baghdad  where  they  are  conducting
         routine security controls and checkpoints."

13.  Therefore the only issue was whether the judge  had  properly  assessed
    the level of risk associated with the Claimant in those  circumstances.
    I have considered the matter for my part and  find  that  the  evidence
    supports to that low standard that arises in Refugee  Convention  cases
    that there is the real risk  of  ill-treatment  so  as  to  engage  the
    Refugee Convention and that there is no evidence  to  suggest  internal
    relocation  is  a  reasonable  option  nor  that  there  is  sufficient
    protection which the Claimant could  have recourse to in Iraq.

14.  Other areas, of course, are identified as  being  areas  where  Article
    15(c) of the Qualification Directive may be  in  play  but  also  where
    there are the Kurdish  areas  to  which  there  is  no  access  to  the
    Claimant.   I  take  into  account  the  arguments  that  were   raised
    concerning the Claimant's father and his history.

15.  In addition, there were clear indications by Mr Richards  that  in  the
    consideration of the claim there would also  be a risk  with  reference
    to Articles 2 and 3 ECHR.  Equally there would  be  no  sufficiency  of
    protection to which the Claimant could  have recourse.

16.  The  Secretary  of  State  in  the  decision  of  2015  had  considered
    paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration Rules.  Mr Richards  accepted  that
    for the purposes of 276ADE(1)(vi) there were exceptional  circumstances
    which make very significant obstacles to integration:   Those  included
    the Claimant's birth in the United Kingdom and long residence  here,his
    westernised appearance and way of life, his lack of family in Iraq.  It
    was effectively conceded that the Claimant did meet the requirements of
    paragraph  276ADE(1)(vi)  of  the  Immigration   Rules   and   in   the
    circumstances the appeal would also succeed on that basis as well.

17.  Further, or in the alternative, Mr Richards also addressed, as  did  Mr
    Heaton, the issue of Article 8 being considered outside  of  the  Rules
    and as he indicated, the Claimant has an extensive family life  in  the
    United Kingdom.  There were the findings made originally by  Designated
    Immigration Judge Philips who had found family life existed as  between
    the Claimant, his father, siblings, their families and the relationship
    that had then been in being between the Claimant and  his  fiancï¿½e  and
    their child.  I was informed that the  Claimant  has  been  seeking  to
    obtain a contact order and has a forthcoming hearing in the new year on
    5 January 2017.

18.  It seemed to me, and Mr Richards agreed, that  there  were  exceptional
    circumstances to consider Article 8 ECHR outside the rules. In doing so
     I took  account  and  applied  Ss.117A  -117C  of  the  NIAA  2002  as
    amended.It was not argued, correctly and unsurprisingly, that the  were
    factors  adverse to the public interest or at all against the  Claimant
    remaining in the UK. On the face of it the Appellant had done enough to
    show that he had a family life and sought to enhance his  private  life
    in the UK, that the effect of his removal would  be  significant,  that
    the Respondent's decision to make removal arrangements was  lawful  and
    arguably in accordance with objectives in Article  8(2)  of  the  ECHR.
    However, on the basis that it was also inappropriate  to curb someone's
    outspokenness in political thinking, or holding political  opinions  as
    part of their private life, in the circumstances removal if,  that  was
    an option  the  Secretary  of  State  contemplated,  it  would  not  be
    proportionate or compliant with Article 8 ECHR.

19.  No representations were made on the issue of anonymity  but  I  do  not
    find that an anonymity order is necessary.



Decision

20.  The appeal is allowed on Refugee Convention grounds.

21.  The appeal is allowed on Articles 2 and 3 ECHR grounds. The  appeal  is
    allowed on Article 8 ECHR grounds.  The appeal  is  allowed  under  the
    Immigration Rules.
