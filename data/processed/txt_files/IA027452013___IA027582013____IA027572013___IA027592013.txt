                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. The Appellants are all citizens of Albania.   They  comprise  the  main
    Appellant, Esmeralda Bakollari, and her husband and two children.   The
    main Appellant applied for leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  4  (General)
    Student Migrant.  The other Appellants applied for similar leave as her
    dependants.  Those applications were refused on 7th  January  2013  for
    the reasons given in a Notice of Decision of that date.  The Appellants
    appealed, and their appeals were heard  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Herlihy (the Judge) sitting at Taylor House on 26th  March  2013.   She
    decided to allow the appeals on Article 8 human  rights  grounds.   The
    Respondent sought leave to appeal that decision, and on 10th  May  2013
    such permission was granted.

Error of Law

 2. I must first decide if the decision of the Judge contained an error  on
    a point of law so that it should be set aside.   The  main  Appellant's
    application for leave to remain was refused because it was decided that
    she had failed to secure  any  points  for  Maintenance  (Funds)  under
    Appendix C of HC 395.  This was because the  Appellant  had  failed  to
    show that she was in possession of the required sum  of  ï¿½7,600  for  a
    consecutive 28 day  period  as  the  Appellant  relied  upon  financial
    sponsorship from her husband which arrangement did not comply with  the
    terms of paragraph 13 of Appendix C.  The Judge did not  disagree  with
    this decision, but found that it amounted to a disproportionate  breach
    of the Appellant's Article 8 rights.  The reasons for that decision are
    given in paragraphs 10.6 to 10.8 inclusive of the  Determination.   The
    Judge was satisfied that the Appellants  had  a  private  life  in  the
    United Kingdom which would be interfered with by the decision to such a
    degree of gravity as to engage the Appellants' Article 8  rights.   The
    Judge then  carried  out  the  balancing  exercise  necessary  for  any
    assessment of proportionality and found that the  public  interest  was
    outweighed by the Appellants' circumstances.  This was because the main
    Appellant had been in the UK since 2007 following a  successive  series
    of progressive studies.  During that time the Appellant's  husband  had
    established a business in the UK, and one of her children  had  started
    attending school.  The Appellant's husband had a bank  account  showing
    possession of the required funds for the required period, but this  had
    not been taken into account when deciding  the  application  under  the
    Immigration Rules as the account was held  in  the  sole  name  of  the
    Appellant's husband.  However those funds were genuinely  available  to
    the Appellant.  The main Appellant and her family were able to maintain
    themselves more than adequately and to finance her studies.

 3. Mr Avery argued that the Judge had erred  in  law  in  coming  to  this
    conclusion.  The Judge had failed to carry out the  balancing  exercise
    properly.  The Judge had not considered whether the family could return
    to Albania and pursue their private life there, and no weight had  been
    attached to the fact that the Appellants only ever had temporary  leave
    to be in the UK.  The Judge  had  applied  some  sort  of  "near  miss"
    principle.

 4. In response, Ms Peterson referred me to her Rule 24 response and argued
    that there had been no error of law in the Judge's decision.  The Judge
    sufficiently explained that decision.  She set out the relevant factors
    at paragraph 10.6 of the Determination.  She  was  entitled  to  attach
    weight to the fact that the main Appellant had reached the later stages
    of high level progressive studies in the UK.

 5. I find no error of law in the Judge's Article 8  decision.   The  Judge
    followed the format given by the decision in R v SSHD ex  parte  Razgar
    [2004] UKHL 27, and demonstrated that she had carried out the balancing
    exercise necessary for any assessment of  proportionality.   The  Judge
    was entitled to attach less weight to the public interest by virtue  of
    the fact that the Appellant's family had sufficient  funds  to  finance
    her proposed further studies, and also by the fact that  the  Appellant
    was proposing to complete a credible course of study in  the  UK.   The
    Judge's reasoning was not inadequate.

Decision

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.

I do not set aside the decision.

Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to Rule  45(4)(i)  of
the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005  and  I  find  no
reason to do so.
