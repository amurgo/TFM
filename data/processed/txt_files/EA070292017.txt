Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr J Collins of Counsel, instructed by Fortwell
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr S Walker, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant is a citizen  of  Ghana  born  on  15th  July  1974.   He
    appeals the decision of the respondent dated 31st July  2017,  refusing
    to issue him with a permanent residence card as the former spouse of an
    EEA national.

2.   The context and chronology is of importance in this matter.   Seemingly
    the appellant came to the United Kingdom in 2011 on a visit  visa.   He
    met his wife, Miss [P], at McDonald's  restaurant  buying  food.   They
    married by a proxy marriage  on  31st  May  2012.   In  July  2012  the
    appellant applied for an EEA residence card which was initially refused
    by the respondent on 21st November 2013.

    An appeal was lodged to the First-tier Tribunal.  It was considered  on
    the papers by First-tier Tribunal Judge Robson on 14th  February  2014.
    The Judge found upon the basis of  the  documentation  that  there  was
    cohabitation and concluded on the formal documents that there had  been
    a lawful marriage and consequently that marriage overall was a  genuine
    one.

3.   On the basis of that he was  issued  with  a  residence  card  on  15th
    August 2015 valid until 14th August 2019.  That residence  was  however
    revoked on 14th July 2016.  That date coincided with the divorce of the
    couple.

4.   On 1st March 2017 the appellant sought a residence card on a  permanent
    basis under the EEA Regulations and that was refused on 31st July  2017
    for the reasons set out in the decision.

5.   What had come to light following a  joint  investigation  was  that  an
    individual  had  been  organising  a  highly   sophisticated   criminal
    enterprise.   Mr  Ndoli  was  convicted  of  a  number  of  charges  of
    conspiracy to defraud.  Such a fraud included the use  of  hundreds  of
    French  identities  that  had  been  "hijacked"  for  the  benefit   of
    immigration purposes.  Applications were made for a national  insurance
    card which was then exploited for  benefits  and  financial  gain.   In
    addition there were some 224 sham marriages that had been organised, 75
    of which had been between Ghanaian nationals and French  nationals.   A
    link had been established between the organiser of such enterprises and
    Miss [P], which reinforced the consideration that she had been involved
    in a sham  marriage  and  certainly  had  been  involved  in  dishonest
    enterprises involving applications for national insurance certificates.
     A copy of her application for a national insurance number was attached
    to the papers.  It was concluded that the marriage conducted was a sham
    and that no credence could be put in any event upon what she had to say
    as to her circumstances and situation in the United Kingdom.

6.   The appeal came before First-tier Tribunal Judge  Nightingale  on  31st
    July 2018.  In the light of that evidence which is summarised  in  some
    detail at paragraphs 24 to 30 the Judge concluded that the marriage was
    one of convenience entered into solely for  the  purposes  facilitating
    the appellant's residence in the United Kingdom.

7.   Challenge is made to that decision and leave to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal was granted.  The matter comes  before  me  to  determine  the
    issues joined as between the parties.  The  first  submission  that  Mr
    Collins makes is to rely upon the decision in Devaseelan v SSHD  [2002]
    UKIAT 00702.  He contends that the issue as to whether the marriage was
    a genuine one was firmly settled by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Robson
    and that there was no safe evidence currently presented  to  go  behind
    that.

8.    As  the  determination  of  Judge  Robson  indicates   there   was   a
    consideration of documents as presented that satisfied the  Judge  that
    the parties were living together since May 2012.  Consideration of  the
    documentation   relating   to   the   proxy   marriage   revealed    no
    irregularities.

9.   Mr Collins expanded his argument by indicating that even  were  it  the
    case that the "sponsor" was involved in illegal activities to  do  with
    fraudulently obtaining national insurance certificates,  such  did  not
    necessarily impinge upon the validity of the marriage  between  herself
    and the appellant.

10.  Mr Collins develops his argument further  by  reference  to  ground  2,
    contending that the Judge considering the issue  of  the  relationship,
    failed to pay attention to the clear documentation that was enclosed in
    the appellant's bundle concerning cohabitation.  I was  referred  to  a
    large number of documents in that  bundle.   There  was  correspondence
    from HMRC directed to Miss [P] at [~], Palmers Green, also the  address
    at which the appellant resided.  In particular there was a letter  from
    Lloyds TSB dated 28th May 2012 to Miss [P] at that address.

11.  From time to time there were also documents addressed to the  appellant
    at that address over the period covered in the bundle  up  until  about
    2015/2016.  It is said that there was cogent evidence of  cohabitation,
    which is indicative of a genuine relationship.   Such he submits simply
    serves to reinforce the findings which were made  initially  by  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Robson.

12.  Although  that  is  a  reasonable  point  to  make  on  behalf  of  the
    appellant, clearly the function of  obtaining  the  national  insurance
    card would be  to  give  the  impression  of  working  and/or  claiming
    benefits and it would be part and parcel of the overall conspiracy that
    there be an identifiable address to which correspondence could be sent.



13.  It seems to me that the First-tier Tribunal Judge was  right  to  focus
    upon the criminality of  the  appellant's  partner,  most  particularly
    because it was  very  specific  to  the  marriage  itself.   The  proxy
    marriage between a French national and  Ghanaian  citizen  matched  the
    profile of some 75 such marriages in the context of 224 sham  marriages
    spanning that particular period.

14.  Further it was noted in the determination, that the  appellant  claimed
    that Miss [P] had been working when he knew her before the marriage and
    that she already had a national insurance number before  he  knew  her.
    Significantly however the application for a national  insurance  number
    was made 28th May 2012, days before the  claimed  marriage,  from  [~],
    Palmers Green, it being said by Miss [P] that she had started living at
    that address on 12th April 2012.  The phone number  was  one  that  was
    used in the criminal enterprise by a significant number of other people
    making such an application for a national  insurance  number.   It  was
    said in that application that Miss [P] was working for Caf� Bleu and  a
    letter from that caf� dated 25th May 2012 accompanied that  application
    saying that she had been offered a job as a chef in that company.   The
    template for that  letter  was  also  found  on  the  computer  of  the
    organiser of the dishonest enterprise.

15.  Thus it is very obvious from that application,  which  she  made,  that
    the appellant's sponsor was actively engaged in  the  purposes  of  the
    wider conspiracy which covered not only  obtaining  national  insurance
    numbers fraudulently but sham marriages.

16.  It was also noted from the oral evidence of the appellant that  he  had
    insisted that his wife had always  been  a  self-employed  hairdresser.
    However when he submitted his application for a residence card  on  the
    basis of the marriage on 12th July 2012, he had given her occupation as
    being in Accounts Tax Limited, an accountancy firm who had stamped  the
    application form. Such was  said  to  be  permanent  employment.   When
    questioned he seemed to know little about that matter  or  indeed  much
    about any earnings related activity which she  carried  out.    At  the
    time of the hearing he did not have any  photographs  of  the  marriage
    ceremony nor know his wife's mobile number.

17.  It was the view of the Judge it was inconceivable  that  the  appellant
    would be unaware of his wife starting a new job on 1st May 2012 or  who
    her employer was at the time that the form was  completed.   All  these
    matters led cumulatively to the consideration as to the genuine  nature
    of the relationship.

18.  So far as the issue of Devaseelan it  is  entirely  right  to  note  at
    paragraph 23 of the determination that that matter was borne in mind by
    the Judge.  Mr Collins makes the point that  the  Judge  was  wrong  to
    consider that it focused mainly on the  legal  validity  of  the  proxy
    marriage as it also incorporated the assessment of the  documents  that
    had been submitted.

19.  It is clear, however, that the Judge considered the  oral  evidence  of
    the appellant together with the other documents.

20.  The decision letter raised concerns as to the nature of the  employment
    of  the  sponsor  and  again  that  is  of  fundamental  importance  in
    determining whether or not she was  exercising  treaty  rights  at  the
    material time.  Clearly being involved in a  criminal  enterprise  does
    not assist her credibility,  nor  indeed  is  there  any  particularity
    advanced as to the nature of her employment.  A significant feature  of
    the communication received from HMRC for the tax years 2011 to 2016  is
    that  for  the  most  part  any  declaration  of  earnings  were  self-
    declarations.  They were always under the tax threshold so the tax  did
    not fall to be paid.  What needed to be paid, however,  was  of  course
    the contribution towards the national insurance contributions.  So, for
    example, page 30 of the bundle is a demand for year 2014 for income tax
    and class 4  national  insurance  contributions  of  �54.72.   The  tax
    calculation for 2012  showed  payment  on  income  tax  of  �80.40  and
    national contributions of �58.68.  All the earnings generally  speaking
    were either under the threshold or attracted very little tax indeed and
    clearly were not verifiable by the HMRC.  If  it  was  the  purpose  to
    obtain a national insurance  certificate  or  a  number,  then  it  was
    clearly important to maintain that number and appearance.

21.  There are  a  number  of  bank  accounts  that  are  presented  in  the
    documents but they relate essentially to the appellant.  There  are  in
    fairness a number of  documents  from  Lloyds  Bank  addressed  to  the
    sponsor.  The statement from January 2015 to  February  2015  shows  an
    overdraft with �101.79 overdrawn.  From  May  2015  there  was  limited
    funds coming in and out of the bank account.  There is little  evidence
    as to the source of such  funds  in  any  event  and  nothing  from  an
    employer to indicate the nature of the  employment  which  the  sponsor
    undertook if at all.

22.   It  seems  to  me  that  the  dishonesty  of  the  spouse  as  clearly
    demonstrated   on   the   evidence   presented   creates    credibility
    difficulties, not only in terms of the genuineness of the marriage, but
    also of the reality of her exercising treaty rights.

23.  Overall I find that the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  has  conducted  a
    proper exercise.  Although it could have been fuller in  terms  of  the
    documentation relied upon in the appellant's bundle and highlighted  by
    Mr Collins before me, I do not find that even a consideration  of  that
    matter could conceivably have resulted in any  material  difference  of
    the outcome.

24.  In those circumstances therefore I do not find there to be  a  material
    error of law.

Notice of Decision

The  appellant's  appeal  before  the  Upper  Tribunal  is  dismissed.   The
decision of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand, namely that his  appeal  is
dismissed in respect of the EEA residence card.

No anonymity direction is made.
