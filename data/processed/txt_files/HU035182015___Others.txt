Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr K Shikder (Tower Hamlets Barristers Chambers)
For the Respondent:    Ms J Isherwood (Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. These are the appeals of Asraf Ali  Aros  (born  20  December  1963),
       Foysal Miah (whose date of birth has been disputed), and  Runa  Begum
       (born 8 October 1999), citizens of Bangladesh, against  the  decision
       of the First-tier Tribunal of 25 April 2017, itself  brought  against
       the refusal of their applications for entry clearance as the  partner
       and children of the Sponsor Mrs Begum, dated 8 July 2015.


    2. The applications were made on  the  basis  that  the  family  members
       wished to join the Sponsor. Mr Aros had married her in 1985, and  she
       went to the UK to settle in September 2012. They stayed in  touch  by
       telephone although had not met in person since she departed  for  the
       UK.


    3. The applications were refused because


      a) The childrens' birth certificates were issued only on 22 November
         2014 and were therefore thought untrustworthy given the general
         evidence of the unreliability of documents from Bangladesh; the
         genuineness of the marriage certificate was similarly doubted;

      b) There was no evidence of contact between the Sponsor and family
         via photographs or otherwise;

      c) Home Office records showed that Foysal Miah (who supplied a birth
         date of 5 September 1998) had been previously been refused an
         application to come to the UK as a Working Holidaymaker in the
         name Foysal Ali (born 18 September 1985);

      d) HMRC checks recorded no earnings as having been declared for the
         Sponsor for the years ending April 2015 and April 2016;

      e) The required evidence by way of accounts, bank statements and
         evidence of tax and national insurance payments under Appendix FM-
         SE had not been provided;

      f) Checks against the electoral register recorded that the Sponsor
         was not registered at the address at [
                    ].



    4. Grounds of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal argued  that  the  wrong
       standard of proof had been supplied, that the approach taken  to  the
       documentary evidence of the childrens' births was  countered  by  DNA
       evidence of parenthood that the  Sponsor  had  established  that  she
       earned over �25,000 annually and that the decisions to  refuse  entry
       clearance were disproportionate. Supporting evidence included  a  DNA
       report from Cellmark of February  2015  stating  that  there  was  an
       overwhelming probability that Hazera Begum was the mother, and  Asraf
       Ali Aros the father, of Runa and Foysol.  A HMRC return for the  year
       ending April 2015 recorded net profit of �25,062 from  the  Sponsor's
       business.


    5. The First-tier Tribunal recorded evidence from the Sponsor Mrs  Begum
       that she was a British citizen  with  six  siblings  and  four  step-
       siblings, all British citizens, living and working in the UK.  Foysal
       Miah had not made an application which had previously  been  refused,
       and the date of birth said to have been given in any such application
       would have post-dated her  marriage  to  her  husband  by  only  four
       months. She visited her  family  in  2014.  They  kept  in  touch  by
       telephone,  Skype  and  other  social  media  (telephone  cards  were
       provided in support of this assertion).


    6. She worked as a tailor, her accounts showing net pre-tax  profits  of
       �25,062 for the year ending April  2015  and  �25,984  for  the  year
       ending April 2016.  Her  husband  was  a  successful  businessman  in
       Bangladesh, employing Foysal Miah, and  had  no  need  for  financial
       support from his wife. She produced tenancy agreements recording that
       she presently rented two bedrooms in a four-bedroom house at
       [                               ], which would provide  enough  room
       for her family members. One of her rented bedrooms presently  housed
       her business; if entry clearance was granted, then she might have to
       look for alternative employment.


    7. Her advocate  Mr  Shikder  made  submissions  before  the  First-tier
       Tribunal arguing that the appeal should be allowed because there  had
       been a disproportionate  interference  with  the  Appellants'  family
       life. Foysal Miah had made "a silly mistake very naively" in  denying
       the fact of his previous application but one that was not  sufficient
       to justify the appeal being dismissed.


    8. Faced with that evidence, the First-tier Tribunal made the  following
       findings, noting that the appeal was brought on human rights  grounds
       alone:


      a) Family life was established on balance of probabilities, given the
         marital status of Mr Aros and Mrs Begum, the DNA evidence of their
         childrens' parentage and the Sponsor's unchallenged evidence that
         her husband and children wished to join her so that they could all
         enjoy the love, comfort and happiness of normal family life -
         other evidence of family life was "not particularly satisfactory",
         in that there was no real explanation provided for the Sponsor's
         sudden decision to move to the UK in 2012, after 27 years of
         marriage, and the telephone cards "did not advance the case for
         family life very far".

      b) The decision denying entry clearance amounted to a material
         interference with family life.

      c) The decision was in accordance with the law save for one concern.

      d) The decision was proportionate, as it was not shown that the
         refusal was unjustifiably harsh. Whilst the evidence ostensibly
         showed that there were sufficient earnings to meet the Appendix FM
         requirements, it was not possible to accept that adequate
         maintenance and accommodation were both at once available. The
         financial requirements of Appendix FM could be met only via the
         Sponsor's earnings from her business, but that business would be
         terminated were she to use the room it presently occupied to house
         family members. There was no evidence of attempts to find
         alternative employment or accommodation.



    9. The First-tier Tribunal addresses the question of the general refusal
       reason based on deception at two points in its decision.


         a) At para 31 the Panel states that the Entry Clearance Officer
            had identified no aggravating circumstances sufficient to raise
            Rule 320(11);

         b) At paras 48-50, the Panel goes on to conclude that although
            there was no direct evidence before it to corroborate the
            Respondent's claim of an earlier application by Foysal Miah,
            which was a serious accusation, it appeared to be backed up by
            fingerprint evidence and there was no witness statement from Mr
            Miah to explain himself further, and in submissions the
            accuracy of the allegation had not been denied by the family's
            advocate.

   10. Grounds of appeal argued that the balance of  probabilities  had  not
       been properly applied and a "heavier  standard  of  proof"  had  been
       required, given the First-tier Tribunal's references to the financial
       requirement being satisfied at one point in their  decision.  It  was
       wrong to tarnish the application of Ms Begum and  Mr  Aros  with  the
       dishonesty found to be established with respect to Mr  Miah.  It  was
       wrong to determine the appeal based on a hypothetical situation  that
       might or might not arise in the future.


   11. Although the First-tier Tribunal refused permission  to  appeal,  the
       Upper Tribunal granted the same on 23 January 2018, on the basis that
       there were arguable errors of law  in  the  findings  as  to  whether
       adequate  accommodation  was  available  and  whether  the  financial
       requirements were met, and in relying on deception by  one  Appellant
       notwithstanding a finding elsewhere that Rule 320(11) did not bite.


   12. Before me Mr Shidker  submitted  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  had
       effectively accepted that the general refusal  reason  was  not  made
       out. Rule  320(11)  required  that  deception  be  established,  plus
       aggravating circumstances, and here the Respondent had simply  failed
       to put a case on the latter issue. The  financial  requirements  were
       met having regard to the strictures of Appendix FM-SE:  all  relevant
       evidence was before the First-tier Tribunal. As to the accommodation,
       it was foreseeable that the Sponsor, given her earnings and the  fact
       that everyone in her extended family worked and  that  the  Appellant
       and at least one child were themselves already employable, could find
       an alternative place to live in the future.


   13. Ms Isherwood replied that the First-tier Tribunal had found that  one
       Appellant had acted dishonestly and was thus entitled  to  rely  upon
       Rule 320(11) as a public interest reason suggesting  that  the  entry
       clearance refusal was generally proportionate.  The  requirements  of
       Appendix FM-SE were not established  as  satisfied:  for  example  no
       statements from a  business  bank  account  had  been  supplied.  The
       decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal   regarding   the   financial
       requirements and accommodation was one to which it could legitimately
       come. She provided a copy of relevant sections  of  the  Housing  Act
       1985, which provides that whilst children under the age of ten do not
       count as adults for the purposes of assessing statutory overcrowding;
       however, two rooms are to be treated as  overcrowded  if  they  house
       more than three individuals of a greater age.


   14. The parties were agreed that were I to identify a material  error  of
       law in the First-tier Tribunal decision, I should go on  and  finally
       determine the appeal based on the materials before me.





Findings and reasons


   15. It seems to me that the First-tier  Tribunal  erred  in  law  in  its
       decision. Firstly, its reasoning as to the public interest ground  is
       seriously confused. The only ground of "General refusal reason"  that
       was put in issue by the  decision  letter  (and  this  was  confirmed
       before me by Ms Isherwood) was Rule 320(11).


           "Part 9: grounds for refusal
           General grounds for the refusal of  entry  clearance,  leave  to
           enter or variation of leave to enter or  remain  in  the  United
           Kingdom
           320. In addition to the grounds of refusal of entry clearance or
           leave to enter set out in Parts 2-8 of these Rules, and  subject
           to paragraph 321 below, the following grounds for the refusal of
           entry clearance or leave to enter apply:
           ...
           Grounds on which entry clearance or leave to  enter  the  United
           Kingdom should normally be refused ...
                 (11) where the applicant  has  previously  contrived  in  a
                 significant way to frustrate the intentions  of  the  Rules
                 by: ...
                       (iv) using deception  in  an  application  for  entry
                       clearance, leave to enter or remain or  in  order  to
                       obtain documents from the Secretary  of  State  or  a
                       third party required in support  of  the  application
                       (whether successful or not);
           and  there  are  other  aggravating   circumstances,   such   as
           absconding,   not    meeting    temporary    admission/reporting
           restrictions or bail conditions, using an  assumed  identity  or
           multiple identities,  switching  nationality,  making  frivolous
           applications  or  not  complying   with   the   re-documentation
           process."


   16. As can readily be seen, this is a discretionary reason  for  refusal.
       It  requires  both  the  identification  of  a  positive   act   that
       constitutes dishonesty or  some  other  breach  of  immigration  law,
       combined with "other aggravating  circumstances".  Ms  Isherwood  was
       able to  point  to  no  such  factor  on  the  facts  of  this  case.
       Accordingly I find that the First-tier  Tribunal  was  right  in  the
       first assessment it made  on  public  policy  grounds  and  wrong  to
       ostensibly revisit that question when it  reverted  to  consider  the
       matter outside the Rules. As Lord Carnwath  stated  in  Patel  [2013]
       UKSC 72 stated at [55] that "the balance drawn by the  rules  may  be
       relevant to the consideration of proportionality". It seems to me  to
       be wrong to take a different approach when considering the appeal  by
       reference  to  a  staged  and   evaluative   consideration   of   the
       proportionality of an immigration decision than  that  identified  by
       the Rules themselves.


   17. Secondly, it seems to me that the First-tier Tribunal took the  wrong
       approach  to  the  assessment  of  the  financial  and  accommodation
       requirements.










   18. The Immigration Rules provide:




           "Appendix FM

                 those two years):
                       (i) annual self-assessment tax return to HMRC (a copy

                 jointly.
                 (g)  Evidence  of  ongoing  self-employment   through   the
                 provision  of  at  least  one  of  the  following:  a  bank
                 statement dated no more than three months earlier than  the
                 date  of  application  showing  transactions  relating   to
                 ongoing trading, or  evidence  dated  no  more  than  three
                 months earlier than the date of application of the  renewal
                 of a licence to trade or of  ongoing  payment  of  business
                 rates,  business-related   insurance   premiums,   employer

                 the parent company.
                 (h) One of the following documents must also be submitted:


                       (i)
                            (aa) If the business  is  required  to  produce
                            annual audited accounts, such accounts for  the
                            last full financial year; or
                            (bb) If the business is not required to produce
                            annual audited accounts, unaudited accounts for
                            the   last   full   financial   year   and   an
                            accountant's certificate of confirmation,  from
                            an  accountant  who  is  a  member  of   a   UK
                            Recognised Supervisory Body (as defined in  the
                            Companies Act 2006) or who is a member  of  the
                            Institute of Financial Accountants;
                       (ii) A certificate of VAT registration  and  the  VAT
                       return for the last full financial year  (a  copy  or
                       print-out) confirming the VAT registration number, if
                       turnover is in excess of �79,000 or was in excess  of
                       the threshold which  applied  during  the  last  full
                       financial year;
                       (iii)   Evidence   to   show   appropriate   planning
                       permission or local  planning  authority  consent  is
                       held to operate the type/class  of  business  at  the
                       trading address (where  this  is  a  local  authority
                       requirement); ..."


   19. It can be seen that the Rules set out a  very  precise  framework  by
       which the adequacy of maintenance is to be assessed, and they  do  so
       by a wholly retrospective calculation, focussed on the  period  prior
       to the date of application. On the other hand,  the  Rule  addressing
       the future housing arrangements posits the  question  whether  "there
       will be adequate accommodation". So I do not consider it was  correct
       for the First-tier Tribunal to find an inconsistency in the  proposed
       arrangements. An applicant under Appendix FM is entitled (indeed,  is
       required) to  rely  on  historic  earnings  yet  put  their  case  on
       accommodation based on future rather than present arrangements.


   20. For these reasons, then, I find that the decision of  the  First-tier
       Tribunal is flawed by material error of law and cannot stand. As  the
       findings required to finally  determine  the  appeal  are  relatively
       limited, I shall accede to the invitation by the parties  to  finally
       determine the appeal.


   21. There is no challenge to the findings below as to  the  existence  of
       family life with which the immigration decision will  interfere.  The
       decision is plainly in accordance with the law and for  a  legitimate
       aim (maintaining immigration control). So  the  question  for  me  is
       essentially one of proportionality.


   22. As noted in Adjei (visit visas - Article 8) [2015] UKUT 261 (IAC), it
       is necessary to be satisfied that Article 8 ECHR  is  engaged  before
       embarking on consideration of the Immigration Rules, given that their
       subject matter is most likely to be relevant to  the  proportionality
       of the decision; as the Tribunal put  it  in  Kaur  [2015]  UKUT  487
       (IAC), "utilising the analysis of Richards LJ in  SS  (Congo)  [2015]
       EWCA Civ 387 , we do not discern any significant gap between the  ...
       rules and "what Article 8 requires".  Notwithstanding the  fact  that
       the decision in SS (Congo) was overturned by the Supreme Court in  MM
       (Lebanon) [2017] UKSC 10, therein Lady Hale and Lord Carnwath confirm
       this reasoning remains extant �77:  "Instructions  ...   have  to  be
       taken into account as part of the overall scheme: on  the  one  hand,
       they might so mitigate the effects of  the  Rules  as  to  make  them
       compatible with the Convention rights when they would  not  otherwise
       have been so". So accordingly the balance struck by the Rules is very
       relevant  when  determining  whether  an  immigration   decision   is
       proportionate.


   23. When an application is assessed on appeal, the  exercise  necessarily
       takes place outside the Rules, given the direct reference in the only
       ground of appeal to the Human Rights Act 1998,  rather  than  to  the
       Rules. However, as noted in Patel, the Rules are very likely to be of
       significant importance,  and  if  they  are  not  met,  then  only  a
       compelling case will suffice. I acknowledge that there may not always
       be a perfect match between the requirements of the Immigration  Rules
       and those of Article 8 ECHR, but it seems to me that there is a  high
       level of consonance between the requirements of  the  Rules  and  the
       making of proportionate decisions under Appendix FM  and  so  I  will
       give central attention to whether the Rules are indeed met.


   24. Reviewing the Appellant's bundle of supporting evidence,  it  appears
       to me that the requirements of Appendix FM-SE  are  met  by  evidence
       extending over the relevant period before the application  was  made.
       There is evidence of the relevant tax liability, self-assessment  tax
       returns and HMRC statements of account, confirmation of  registration
       with HMRC bearing the Appellant's tax reference number,  evidence  of
       the income being  paid  into  the  Sponsor's  personal  bank  account
       including  recent  bank  statements,  and  a  copy  of  the  business
       accounts.  Contrary  to  Ms  Isherwood's  submission,  there  is   no
       requirement that funds be paid into  a  business  bank  account  when
       relying earnings from self-employment. So I accept that the financial
       requirements of the Rules are satisfied.


   25. That leaves the question of accommodation. This is a case  where  the
       Sponsor has shown herself to be an established businesswoman who  has
       maintained  herself  in  adequate  accommodation  for  a  significant
       period. Following the arrival of her family  members  here  she  will
       have the advantage of their ability to find work, too;  the  evidence
       that her husband is a successful businessman has not been challenged.




   26. It seems to me to be somewhat unrealistic to expect the Appellant  to
       incur the expense of accommodation well beyond her present needs  for
       a very significant period before her family members arrive here. This
       is demonstrated in this case by the chronology: the  application  was
       made almost three years ago, on 14 May 2015, and it  took  the  Entry
       Clearance Manager six months to even conduct a preliminary review  of
       their own decision on 17 November 2015. It seems to me that a  family
       unit with a track record  of  supporting  themselves  via  their  own
       entrepreneurialism,  and  who  understand  full  well   the   precise
       requirements of the Rules on accommodation, can be trusted to  ensure
       that their future housing arrangements are fully compliant  with  the
       legislation on overcrowding.


   27. Additionally, having  regard  to  the  matters  that  Parliament  has
       endorsed as requiring attention routinely in a judicial evaluation of
       proportionality as  set  out  in  section  117B  of  the  Nationality
       Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, I note that the Secretary  of  State
       has not suggested that there is  any  reason  to  consider  that  the
       Appellants will be at any  disadvantage  in  integrating  because  of
       their English language ability, and they have always been financially
       independent. The Sponsor has always been present lawfully in  the  UK
       and a single Appellant's historic act of  dishonesty  was  relatively
       minor, committed during  their  childhood,  and  did  not  reach  the
       "aggravated"  level  which  the  Rules  themselves  identify  as  the
       relevant benchmark.  I accordingly find that  the  interference  with
       family  life  occasioned  by  the  decision   appealed   against   is
       disproportionate to the public interest it aims  to  achieve,  and  I
       allow the appeals.

      Decision:

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained a material  error  of
    law.
    I have re-considered the appeals and I allow them because the  refusals
    of entry clearance were contrary to the Human Rights Act 1998.

Signed:                                            Date: 5 April 2018
