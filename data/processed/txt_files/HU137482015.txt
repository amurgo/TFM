                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Secretary of State appeals from  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge R L Walker, sitting at  Hatton  Cross  on  10  November
    2016) purporting to allow under the  Regulations  2006  the  claimant's
    appeal against the Secretary of State to refuse to grant her ILR  under
    the Immigration Rules on the grounds of continuous lawful  residence  .
    The First-tier Tribunal did not make an anonymity direction, and we  do
    not consider that the claimant requires anonymity for these proceedings
    in the Upper Tribunal.

The Reasons for the Grant of Permission to Appeal

 2. On 3 May 2017 the First-tier Tribunal Judge Kelly granted the Secretary
    of State permission to appeal for the following reasons:

         "It is arguable  that,  given  that  the  [claimant]  had  made  an
         application for leave to remain under the Immigration  Rules,  with
         the consequence  that  there  was  an  "EEA  decision"  before  the
         Tribunal, it constituted a material  error  in  law  to  allow  the
         appeal "under the Regulations".  That is not  to  say  whether  the
         claimant's partner had been residing in  the  UK  as  a  "Qualified
         Person" under the Regulations was wholly immaterial to  the  issues
         that were in fact before the Tribunal, given their relevance to the
         question of whether the claimant had been residing  in  the  United
         Kingdom "lawfully" for the purposes of the Immigration  Rules  with
         the consequence weight attaching thereto and the assessment of  her
         rights under Article 8 of  the  1950  European  Convention  of  the
         Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.  Nevertheless,
         the arguable error of law identified in the grounds may  well  have
         been  material  to  the  eventual  outcome  of  the  appeal   where
         permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal is accordingly granted."

Relevant Background Facts

 3. The claimant is a national of Ghana.  She entered the UK on  19  August
    2005 with entry clearance as a student valid until  30  November  2006.
    The claimant extended her  leave  as  a  student  on  three  subsequent
    occasions, with the consequence that she  had  continuous  leave  as  a
    student until 31 October 2009.  On 20 October 2009 the claimant applied
    for further leave to remain as a Tier  4  (Student)  migrant,  and  the
    application was refused on 12 August 2010.  The claimant appealed on 27
    August 2010, and her appeal was dismissed by the First-tier Tribunal on
    23 November 2010.  The claimant became  appeal  rights-exhausted  on  3
    December 2010.

 4. On 20 March 2011 the claimant applied for a residence  card  under  the
    Regulations 2006 as a spouse  of  an  EEA  national  exercising  Treaty
    rights here.  She was issued with a residence permit valid from 14 July
    2011 until 14 July 2016.

 5. On 13 August 2015 the claimant applied for indefinite leave  to  remain
    on the ground that she had accrued ten years' lawful residence  in  the
    United Kingdom.  On her application form, she said that she had married
    her EEA national sponsor on 14 September 2010, while she had section 3C
    leave under the 1971 Act on account of  her  having  a  pending  appeal
    against the refusal of her in-time application  for  further  leave  to
    remain as a student.  She  said  her  EEA  national  sponsor  had  been
    exercising Treaty rights  since  the  date  of  their  marriage  on  14
    September 2010, and so her lawful residence had remained unbroken.

 6. She was asked, at section D15 of the application form, to state on what
    basis the EEA national was exercising Treaty  rights.   She  said  that
    from 14 September 2010 until the present day, he  had  been  exercising
    Treaty rights as a Worker for an  employer  called  Proclense  Valeting
    Services in Welwyn, Hertfordshire.

 7. She said that she had been living in Moniton Court, Stanley Park  Road,
    Wallington in Surrey from 10 August 2008 to 13 March 2013, and then  at
    Widcote Court, Widcote Road, Wallington, Surrey from 13 March  2013  to
    the present day.

 8. By a letter dated 4 November 2015 addressed  to  the  claimant  at  the
    address which she gave in her application form, a Case Worker  for  the
    Managed Migration Department in Liverpool  requested  the  claimant  to
    provide evidence that her EEA  national  sponsor  had  been  exercising
    Treaty rights continuously in the UK  throughout  the  period  from  31
    October 2009 until the current date.  The documentary evidence that she
    might wish to present for any relevant category might typically be:

         A Worker: wage  slips;  pay  advices;  bank  statements;  P60s  and
         correspondence from HMRC.

         A self-employed person: audited accounts;  invoices  and  receipts;
         business  bank   statements;   evidence   of   national   insurance
         contributions  and  correspondence  from  HMRC  pertaining  to  tax
         payments.

 9. The claimant was asked to respond to the request within  14  days.   If
    she failed to provide the required documents, the application would  be
    considered on the basis of documents she had  already  provided.   This
    might result in  her  application  being  refused  in  accordance  with
    paragraph 322(9) of the Rules.

10. On 3 December 2015,  the  Secretary  of  State  gave  her  reasons  for
    refusing the claimant's application.  She acknowledged that, under  her
    discretionary policy, the time spent in the UK as a lawful resident  by
    an EU or EEA national (or their family members) exercising their Treaty
    rights counted towards lawful residence where sufficient  evidence  had
    been provided to demonstrate, "that the applicant has  been  exercising
    Treaty rights through any period that they are seeking to rely  on  for
    the purposes of meeting the long residence Rules."

11. At the time of the issuance to her of her EEA residence card on 14 July
    2011, the claimant had a right to reside under such Regulations 2006 as
    her partner was exercising Treaty rights at that  time.   However,  she
    had been unable  to  provide  evidence  to  demonstrate  that  her  EEA
    national partner had since continued to reside in the United Kingdom in
    accordance with the Regulations.  So the period upon which  she  relied
    in her current application was not accepted to contribute  towards  the
    ten year legal leave period  as  a  whole.   She  had  been  unable  to
    demonstrate that she had resided in accordance  with  the  Regulations,
    and therefore it was deemed that she had no basis of stay in the United
    Kingdom.  The SSHD was not  prepared  to  exercise  discretion  in  her
    circumstances.

12. Furthermore, the department had written  to  her  on  4  November  2015
    requesting further evidence, but to date no response had been received.
     So, her application was also refused under paragraph 322(9).

The Hearing Before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

13.  The  grounds  of  appeal  were  settled  by  the  claimant's   current
    representatives.  They pleaded that the decision was not in  accordance
    with the law  as  the  SSHD  had  erred  in  not  fully  examining  the
    immigration history of their client.  If she  had  done  so,  the  SSHD
    would have found that the claimant had  met  the  requirements  of  ten
    years' lawful residence in the UK so as to be granted ILR.

14. The grounds of appeal did  not  comment  on  the  asserted  failure  to
    respond to a  request  for  further  evidence,  or  the  refusal  under
    paragraph 322(9).

15. In compliance with directions made by  the  Tribunal,  at  the  end  of
    October 2016 the claimant's representatives served on the Tribunal  and
    on the  Home  Office  Presenting  Officer's  Unit  the  bundle  of  the
    documents upon which the claimant proposed to rely at  the  forthcoming
    hearing.  The bundle contained a witness statement  from  the  claimant
    dated 10 November 2016.  In her statement, she said that  she  had  not
    received  the  letter  requesting  proof  that  her  husband  had  been
    continuously exercising Treaty rights,  and  thus  she  was  unable  to
    respond to it.  Her  husband  used  to  work  with  Proclense  Valeting
    Services.  His contract with them had then come to an end. At the  time
    of her application for ILR, he was exercising Treaty rights as a  self-
    employed mechanic. In March 2016 he had got a job as a driver.

16. At the hearing before Judge Walker, the claimant was represented by  Mr
    Jafar of Counsel, and there was no appearance by a  Presenting  Officer
    on behalf of the Secretary of State.

17. In his subsequent decision, the Judge summarised the reasons given  for
    refusal by the Secretary of State at paragraph [15], and he set out the
    claimant's case at paragraphs [16] to [18].   Her  case  was  that  her
    husband had been working either as self-employed  or  employed  at  all
    times since she was first granted a residence permit.   She  said  that
    her husband had at all times resided in the UK in accordance  with  the
    Regulations 2006 "and since 14 July 2011".

18. The Judge made findings of fact and credibility at paragraphs [22]-[27]
    of his decision.  He observed at paragraph [24] that, as there had been
    no Presenting Officer, there had been no cross-examination  and  so  no
    testing of the claimant's case.  At  paragraphs  [25]-[26],  the  Judge
    made extensive reference to a decision of  Judge  Keith  in  an  appeal
    heard at Hatton Cross on  13  April  2016.  The  appeal  concerned  the
    claimant's daughter.  She successfully appealed against the decision by
    the SSHD to refuse to issue her with a  residence  card  as  the  step-
    daughter of Mr Menezes, the claimant's husband.  Judge Keith found that
    Mr Menezes was exercising Treaty rights as a Worker at the date of  the
    hearing  before  him  (13  April  2016).   Judge  Walker  continued  in
    paragraph [27]:

         "The decision shows that Mr Menezes was and has been exercising his
         Treaty rights in the  UK.   The  [claimant's]  bundle  provided  in
         today's appeal includes some information (our emphasis)  about  his
         work - past and present - and with payslips that go up to August of
         this year.  This is evidence that has not been  questioned  by  the
         [Secretary of State].  I  find  this  sufficient  to  show  on  the
         balance  of  probabilities  that  Mr  Menezes  has  been   properly
         exercising Treaty rights throughout the relevant period."

19. The Judge went on to allow the appeal under the Regulations 2006.

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

20. At the hearing before us to determine whether an error of law was  made
    out, Mr Jarvis referred us to the skeleton argument which  he  prepared
    for hearing and in which he developed the  arguments  advanced  in  the
    permission application.  On behalf of the claimant, Mr Corswell mounted
    a robust defence of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge.   He
    submitted that there was no material error, as it was reasonably  clear
    that the Judge had found in the claimant's favour on  the  issue  which
    was properly before him, namely whether  she  had  accrued  ten  years'
    continuous lawful residence through a  combination  of  student  leave,
    section 3C leave and right  of  residence  as  the  spouse  of  an  EEA
    national exercising Treaty rights here.  If the decision was read  with
    the contents of the letter of 4 November 2015, it was reasonably  clear
    that what the Judge had in mind when he said that Mr Menezes  had  been
    properly exercising his Treaty rights "throughout the relevant  period"
    was that he had continuously exercised Treaty rights  from  31  October
    2009 and/or from the date of his marriage to the claimant in  September
    2010.

Discussion

21.  The  claimant's  appeal  is  governed  by  the  new  statutory  regime
    introduced from 6 April 2015.   In  refusing  to  grant  her  ILR,  the
    Secretary of State decided  to  refuse  a  human  rights  claim.  Under
    section 84(2) of the 2002 Act, as amended by the Immigration Act  2014,
    an appeal under section 82(1)(b) - where the  Secretary  of  State  has
    decided to refuse a human rights claim - must be brought on the  ground
    that the decision is unlawful under section 6 of the Human  Rights  Act
    1998.

22. Section 85(5) of the  2002  Act  provides  that  a  Tribunal  must  not
    consider a new matter on appeal unless the Secretary of State has given
    the Tribunal consent to do so.

23. On the case advanced before Judge Walker, it would have  been  open  to
    the claimant to have applied for a permanent residence card  under  the
    Regulations 2006 instead of  going  down  the  route  of  applying  for
    indefinite leave to remain on the  grounds  of  ten  years'  continuous
    lawful residence.  She chose not to go down this route, and so the only
    matter which was properly before Judge Walker was whether she qualified
    for indefinite leave to remain  under  the  Rules;  or,  failing  that,
    whether she should be granted Article 8 relief outside the Rules.   The
    First-tier Tribunal had no jurisdiction to allow the claimant's  appeal
    under the Regulations 2006.

24. We consider that the Judge's error goes deeper than allowing the appeal
    on a ground that it is not permitted by statute.  The Judge also failed
    to engage with the general ground of refusal  under  paragraph  322(9).
    Moreover, the Judge failed to make clear findings on  the  question  of
    whether the claimant had discharged the burden of proving that she  was
    continuously lawfully resident as the family member of an EEA  national
    from 31 October 2009, and/or from September 2010, until 19 August 2015.

25. The fact that there was no  Presenting  Officer  present,  and  so  the
    claimant's evidence could not be tested in cross-examination,  did  not
    relieve the Judge of the obligation to consider  the  evidence  bearing
    upon the claimant's asserted  failure  to  respond  to  a  request  for
    information letter which was purportedly sent to  the  correct  address
    (which was also the address to which the refusal letter was sent to and
    apparently received by the claimant  a  month  later)  and  to  make  a
    reasoned finding as to whether or not he accepted that the  letter  had
    not reached the claimant.

26. The Judge also needed to make a clear finding as to (a)  the  point  at
    which the claimant began to have lawful residence as the family  member
    of an EEA national exercising Treaty rights here; and (b) as to whether
    the claimant had demonstrated a continuous exercise of Treaty rights by
    her EEA national spouse so as to qualify for ILR under a combination of
    the Rules and the policy concession.

27. Accordingly, we are in no doubt that the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal is vitiated by a material error of law, such that it  must  be
    set aside in its entirety and re-made.  Mr Corswell invited us  to  re-
    make the decision on the documentary evidence that was put  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge.  We  decline  to  do  so  for  two  reasons.
    Firstly, we consider that the Secretary of State has been deprived of a
    fair hearing in  the  First-tier  Tribunal  on  the  issues  that  were
    properly before the First-tier Tribunal.  Secondly,  we  consider  that
    the extent of judicial fact-finding that would be required is such that
    it is more appropriate for the First-tier Tribunal to hear  the  appeal
    de novo.  We are reinforced  in  this  view  by  Mr  Menezes'  national
    insurance record which was downloaded from a Government  website  on  6
    June 2017 and shown to us by Mr Colswell.  Mr Menezes does not  have  a
    "full year" insurance record for the following  tax  years:  2011-2012,
    2012-2013, 2013-2014 and 2014-2015.  In  the  tax  year  2011-2012  his
    contributions from paid employment were only �46.47.  This is in  stark
    contrast to the previous tax year, where he  accumulated  38  weeks  of
    National  Insurance  credits  and  he  paid  contributions  from   paid
    employment amounting to �275.59.

Notice of Decision

28. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained an error of law, such
    that the decision must be set aside and remade.

Directions

29. This appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal at Hatton Cross  for
    a de novo hearing (Judge Walker incompatible).

We make no anonymity direction.
