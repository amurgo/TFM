Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant a citizen of Pakistan (born  8th  August  1983)  appeals,
    with permission, to the Upper Tribunal against the decision of a First-
    tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Walters)  promulgated  on  26th  October   2015
    dismissing his appeal against the Respondent's  refusal  to  issue  him
    with a residence card as the family member (spouse) of an EEA  national
    exercising treaty rights in the UK.

Background

 2. The Appellant entered the UK on 5th April 2011 in possession of a  Tier
    4 (General) Student visa valid until 21st July 2012.  A further student
    visa was then granted to him, valid until 20th September 2014.

 3. On 7th January 2014 the Appellant married Miss  V  Tesarova,  a  Polish
    citizen exercising treaty rights  in  the  UK  (the  Sponsor).  On  8th
    September 2014 the Appellant applied for a residence card as the spouse
    of an EEA national under the EEA Regulations 2006.

 4. In support of his application he submitted wage slips and an employment
    contract in Miss Tesarova's name, from  an  employer  named  as  "Leeds
    Mobiles and Computers".

 5. The Respondent undertook the  usual  checks  to  verify  the  Sponsor's
    employment.  On 21st April 2015 a telephone call was made by to  "Leeds
    Mobiles and Computers" firm.  This resulted in the owner informing  the
    Respondent that the Sponsor had left their employment in March 2015.

 6. The Appellant was therefore given three months to inform the Respondent
    of any change of circumstances.  He failed to  do  so  and  no  further
    evidence  was  submitted  showing  that  the  Sponsor   was   currently
    exercising  treaty  rights.   The  Respondent  therefore  refused   the
    Appellant's application for a residence card.

The FtT Hearing

 7. The Appellant appealed that refusal to  the  First-tier  Tribunal.  The
    appeal  came  before  that  Tribunal  as  a  paper  hearing  upon   the
    Appellant's request.

 8. The FtT noted that the Appellant had  served  a  bundle  of  documents.
    Included  in  the  bundle  were  three  copy  wage  slips   from   "PMP
    Recruitment" in the  name  of  the  Sponsor,  a  copy  Nationwide  Bank
    statement in the joint names of the Appellant and the Sponsor,  showing
    a credit to the account of ï¿½104 on 10th July 2015  -  a  credit  amount
    which matches the figure shown in the Sponsor's  payslip  of  the  same
    date.  The papers also contained  a  contract  of  employment  for  the
    Sponsor with "PMP Recruitment", signed and dated by the Sponsor on 14th
    April 2015.

 9. The  judge  dismissed  the  Appellant's  appeal,  because  he  was  not
    satisfied of the provenance of the wage slips which had been  produced.
    In coming to his conclusions the judge said at [17],

         "Unfortunately,  both  these  documents  are  photocopied  (he  was
         referring  to  the  wage  slips).   I  did  not  find   that   they
         satisfactorily proved that Miss Tesarova is employed as she states.
          At least, original documents should have been provided.  It  would
         obviously have been more satisfactory if Miss Tesarova had come  to
         court to give oral evidence."

10. The judge followed this up at [18] saying:

         "I accepted that Miss Tesarova was working for 'Leeds  Mobiles  and
         Computers' up to  the  end  of  March  2015,  but  no  satisfactory
         evidence has been produced of her employment thereafter.   Nor  has
         any evidence been produced during the period between March 2015 and
         June 2015 (when the Respondent's decision was made) that she was in
         receipt of Job Seeker's Allowance."

    He went on to dismiss the appeal.

11. The Appellant sought permission to appeal.   In  his  grounds  he  took
    issue with the judge's decision to discount the wage slips produced. He
    said he found this hard to  accept  because  it  states  in  "your  own
    guidance" that "photocopies can be accepted".  "It does not say that  I
    have to provide originals as a rule of law.  I think the error  of  law
    is the application of evidence."

12. Permission to appeal was granted in the following terms:

         "An arguable error of law has arisen  in  respect  of  the  judge's
         rejection of photocopy evidence.  The case was dealt  with  on  the
         papers.  The judge has stated  that  at  least  original  documents
         should have been provided.

         Given the circumstances attending the decision  on  the  papers  an
         arguable error of law has arisen."

    Thus the matter comes before  the  Upper  Tribunal  to  decide  if  the
    decision of the FtT contains such error, that it  requires  to  be  set
    aide and remade.

The UT Hearing

13. Before me the Appellant was represented by Ms Najma and the  Respondent
    by Ms Pettersen.  Both the Appellant  and  the  Sponsor  Miss  Tesarova
    attended.

14. Further evidence was admitted at the hearing.  Miss Tesarova was  asked
    by Ms Pettersen if she was able to produce the original wage slips. She
    did so, and those original wage slips together with the bank statements
    produced showed a match between  the  amounts  entered  into  the  bank
    account and the amounts on the wage slips.

15. Ms Pettersen asked for permission to make some  enquiries  in  view  of
    this evidence.  At the conclusion of those enquiries, she said that she
    was satisfied that  the  Sponsor  employment  was  as  claimed  and  as
    evidenced by the original wage slips which had now been produced.   She
    was satisfied that the appropriate course  was  for  me  to  allow  the
    Appellant's appeal.

16. I am satisfied that, on the basis of the new  evidence  produced,  that
    the decision of the FtT must be set aside for error  and  the  decision
    remade.  Material facts have been overlooked by the FtT in its decision
    when it failed to take into account the copy wage slips/bank statements
    produced.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal promulgated on 26th October 2015  is
hereby set aside.  I remake the decision.  This appeal is allowed.

No anonymity direction is made.

FEE AWARD

There is no fee award.  The original decision by the  Respondent  was  based
on a failure by the Appellant to advise the Respondent  of  any  changes  in
the Sponsor's employment.   Therefore  I  consider  that  no  fee  award  is
appropriate.
