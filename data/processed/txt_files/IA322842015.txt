Representation:
For the Appellant:      Mr J Dhanji of Counsel, instructed by M and K
Solicitors
For the Respondent:     Mr T Melvin, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. The appellant challenges  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
      Judge Green dismissing his appeal  on  article  8  grounds.  He  is  a
      Pakistani national born on 29 January 1991 who had Tier 4 leave  until
      3 March 2015. On 25 February 2015 he made an application for leave  to
      remain as the spouse of the sponsor.  This was refused on 21 September
      2015 because the respondent considered that the sponsor did  not  earn
      at least �18,600 per annum and so the maintenance requirements had not
      been met and also because she  was  of  the  view  that  he  had  used
      deception in a previous application in that he had used a  proxy  test
      taker to sit for  an  English  language  examination.  The  respondent
      therefore  considered  that  he  failed  to   meet   the   suitability
      requirements.


   2. The appellant lodged an appeal but as the decision was  made  after  5
      April 2015 the only ground of appeal available to  him  was  that  the
      decision breached his human rights.


   3. The judge heard arguments on article 8 and on whether the requirements
      of the rules were met  in  relation  to  the  matters  raised  by  the
      respondent as those formed part of the balancing exercise  undertaken.
      The judge was satisfied that the respondent  had  not  discharged  the
      evidential burden in respect of the allegation of deception  and  also
      that the appellant's evidence had persuaded him that he had taken  the
      test himself. With respect to the sponsor's income, he calculated that
      the documentary evidence demonstrated that the sponsor earned  �17,452
      per annum. He considered that the 'near-miss' principle could  not  be
      applied by taking into account post decision evidence and he concluded
      that the requirements of paragraph 276ADE (1)(v) and (vi) had not been
      met. He proceeded  to  consider  whether  there  were  any  compelling
      circumstances which would warrant a grant of  discretionary  leave  on
      article 8 grounds but took the view that the  appellant  could  go  to
      Pakistan and seek entry clearance and  that  there  would  be  minimal
      disruption to family  life  if  he  did  so,  either  on  his  own  or
      accompanied by his wife.


   4. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Keane on
      the basis that the judge arguably erred in  his  calculations  of  the
      sponsor's income.


   5. At the hearing before me on 2 December 2016, I heard submissions  from
      the parties. Mr Dhanji submitted that the  judge  had  found  for  the
      appellant on the deception issue so the only other matter  related  to
      the sponsor's income. He referred me to the  manner  in  which  income
      should be calculated as set out in the policy guidance  and  submitted
      that from the  evidence  of  pay  slips  before  the  judge  from  the
      sponsor's two jobs, she was earning a total of �21,411. The judge  had
      not given any reason  for  not  accepting  this  calculation  and  had
      reached the wrong answer.


   6. Mr Dhanji then referred to the respondent's cross  appeal  brought  in
      her Rule 24 response. He  submitted  that  it  was  not  open  to  the
      respondent to raise a cross appeal in this way and relied on EG and NG
      (Upper Tribunal rule 17: withdrawal; rule 24  scope)  Ethiopia  [2013]
      UKUT 00143 (IAC).


   7. In response Mr Melvin submitted that headnote 3 of EG and NG  made  it
      plain that it was only where a  party  was  seeking  to  persuade  the
      Tribunal to replace a decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  with  a
      decision that would make a material difference to one of the  parties,
      that permission to appeal was needed. In this case, the respondent was
      seeking to uphold the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal.  She  was,
      therefore, entitled to challenge the findings made  on  the  issue  of
      deception. Mr Melvin argued that the judge had erred in  holding  that
      the evidential burden had not  been  discharged  by  the  respondent's
      reliance on generic  evidence  and  that  infected  the  rest  of  his
      findings.


   8. With respect to the  matter  of  the  sponsor's  earnings,  Mr  Melvin
      submitted that the pay slips in respect of the second job had not been
      submitted to the respondent with the application and did not correlate
      with any bank statements. The  remaining  pay  slips  showed  a  total
      income  of  �17,452  and  the  judge  therefore  reached   the   right
      conclusion. He considered family life and the  appellant's  option  to
      make an entry clearance application.  As  all  settlement  cases  were
      decided within 60 days, there would be no great delay.


   9. Mr Dhanji replied. He stated that even if the respondent's  ground  of
      appeal was admitted, it was not material as the judge had gone  on  to
      make further findings that the legal burden had not been discharged.


  10. At the conclusion of the hearing I reserved my determination  which  I
      now give.


                   Findings and conclusions

  11. I deal first with the matter of  the  respondent's  challenge  to  the
      findings of the judge on the issue of deception. I accept that as  the
      respondent is not seeking to alter the decision of the  Tribunal,  the
      guidance in EG and NG is not applicable. I  admit  the  challenge.   I
      also accept that the judge erred in his finding  that  the  evidential
      burden had not been discharged by the respondent when  she  sought  to
      rely on the generic ETS evidence. Following on from the authorities on
      this matter, which he has considered in his determination,  he  should
      have concluded that the evidential burden  had  been  discharged.  His
      failure to do so is an error of law. However, I agree with  Mr  Dhanji
      that this error is not a material  one.  This  is  because  the  judge
      considered the evidence of the appellant whom he found to be  credible
      and concluded that the appellant had taken the test himself.  He  sets
      out the evidence at length at paragraph 10 (i)-(iii) and 11-12 and his
      conclusions are at paragraph 14 and 24. Whether or not  he  had  found
      that the evidential burden had been  discharged,  would  have  had  no
      impact on this conclusion. I, therefore, preserve his finding that the
      appellant had not used deception to obtain a certificate from ETS.


  12. Coming next to the issue of the sponsor's earnings. I accept that  the
      income calculations as  set  out  in  the  grounds  and  the  skeleton
      argument  submitted  to  the  judge  were  in  accordance   with   the
      respondent's policy guidance however it is not correct to suggest that
      the judge gave no reason for rejecting these. At paragraph 25 he  sets
      out what the evidence submitted with the application showed  as  being
      the sponsor's total income and at paragraph 26 he notes that the  post
      decision evidence demonstrated  that  the  sponsor  had  documented  a
      higher income. However, he then went on to explain why  he  could  not
      take that evidence into account.


  13. The calculations prepared for  the  appellant  include  post  decision
      evidence. The judge gave clear reasons why he was unable  to  consider
      this. Furthermore, as pointed out by Mr Melvin,  there  were  no  bank
      statements to support the evidence in respect to the second employment
      and Mr Dhanji did not seek to dispute this in his submissions.


  14. It is  clear,  therefore,  that  on  the  evidence  submitted  by  the
      appellant with is application, the maintenance requirements  were  not
      shown to have been met.  The judge did not  miscalculate  the  figures
      and he did not fail to provide reasons for rejecting  the  appellant's
      calculations. It follows that there  was  no  error  of  law  in  this
      respect.


  15. Should the appellant now consider that he can meet the requirements of
      the rules, it is open to him to make an  entry  clearance  application
      from Pakistan as suggested by  the  judge.  Mr  Melvin  has  helpfully
      indicated that all settlement applications are dealt  with  within  60
      days and so if the sponsor  does  not  accompany  the  appellant,  the
      separation would not be a lengthy one.


  16. Decision


  17. The determination does not contain any material errors of  law  and  I
      uphold it.


  18. The appeal is dismissed.
