For the Appellant:     No appearance
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan (Presenting Officer)

                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This appeal arises from the appeal of Md Ahamed Sharif, a citizen of
       Bangladesh born 19 July 1980, against the decision  of  16  December
       2014 to refuse his application for further  leave  to  remain  as  a
       student. The appeal having been dismissed by the First-tier Tribunal
       he now appeals to the Upper Tribunal with permission.


    2. He was originally granted leave to enter as a Tier 4 student from 14
       January 2010 until 17 February 2011, his leave being extended  until
       28 June 2014 in that category. His application for further leave  to
       remain to study for a Level  6  Diploma  in  Management  at  Sanjari
       International College from 9 July 2014 until 30  December  2015  was
       refused because it was believed that he had overstayed in the United
       Kingdom for more than 28 days, his leave having expired on  28  June
       2014 and his application being made on 21 August 2014;  additionally
       an unacceptable CAS reference number had been submitted, and  so  he
       could not satisfy the requirement of Appendix  A  to  hold  a  valid
       Certificate of Acceptance for Studies (CAS).


   3. Grounds of appeal alleged that the Respondent had miscalculated the
      Appellant's date of application, which had been made online on 27 June
      2014, the relevant application fee being taken by the Home Office that
      very day: thus pursuant to Immigration Rule 34G(iv), the date of
      application was that on which it was submitted online. The Appellant's
      Sponsor's licence had been revoked before he was assigned a CAS: his
      legal representatives had sought suspension of the decision making
      process whilst he secured a CAS, but his application was refused
      without regard to that request. The decision was therefore contrary to
      the principles of common law fairness identified in decisions such as
      Thakur and Patel.


   4. His witness statement set out that in order to enrol with Sanjani
      College he had needed to obtain appropriate evidence of his English
      language proficiency and to pay the first year of tuition fees of
      ï¿½2,500; the process of raising those funds and registering for the
      test meant he had to submit his application without a CAS.  All places
      to sit for the test were taken up. He became very anxious and lacked
      funds to go elsewhere, having now paid his deposit. By the time he had
      raised funds to study at a different college his application had been
      refused.


   5. Dismissing the appeal on 18 June 2015, the First-tier Tribunal noted
      that it was now agreed that the decision letter had erred in its
      allegation that the Appellant had applied after his leave's expiry;
      however the appeal was doomed to fail without a valid CAS, and it was
      not suggested that the decision amounted to a disproportionate
      interference with his human rights.


   6. Grounds of appeal submitted that the First-tier Tribunal had erred in
      law in overlooking the Appellant's explanation for his difficulties in
      supplying a CAS.


   7. On 12 June 2015 Judge Bruce granted permission to appeal on the
      grounds that the First-tier Tribunal had arguably erred in law in
      overlooking the Respondent's ostensible failure to implement their
      usual policy to give sixty days' grace for an applicant to find an
      alternative Sponsor where their original college had lost its licence.




   8. There was no appearance before me on the Appellant's behalf, but
      absent an explanation for that, and given that I do not consider that
      the interests of justice require that he be represented, the grounds
      of appeal apparently being comprehensive, I considered it appropriate
      to determine the appeal. Mr Tufan submitted that given no CAS had been
      submitted, the Home Office policy to give an opportunity to find an
      alternative Sponsor was not in play, and the appeal had therefore been
      appropriately dismissed.


Findings and reasons


9. The first ground of appeal asserts that the Appellant's explanation  for
   failing to put forward a CAS was overlooked.


10. The relevant Home Office Guidance around the  time  of  the  Appellant's
   application in relation to applications for leave to  remain  under  the
   Tier 4 Student category sets out:


      "Where the applicant was assigned a CAS by  the  sponsor  before  they
      were removed from the sponsor register, the  applicant  can  apply  to
      extend their leave. ...
      2. Where the application does not meet the requirements, refuse it.
      3. Where it does meet the requirements, put it on hold. ...
      5. If the student's  application  has  been  held  and  the  sponsor's
      licence is revoked, and the student has been a bona fide  student  and
      did not participate in the practices which led to the revocation,  the
      options for action depend on the leave that they have:
      If they still have at least 60 days permission to stay remaining,  you
      must curtail their leave so that it will expire once the period of  60
      days has run out. During this 60 days they can seek a new CAS  from  a
      different sponsor and  either  vary  their  application,  make  a  new
      application or leave the UK. If their  permission  to  stay  runs  out
      whilst they are waiting for a decision on their application  you  must
      delay the refusal of their application for 60 days to  allow  them  to
      seek a new CAS from a different sponsor and vary their leave."


11. It is clear that the Appellant did not have a CAS at the  time  he  made
   his application, and so he does not meet the gateway requirements of the
   policy. Of course the content of Home Office policy is  not  necessarily
   the only arbiter of fairness: as shown by Doody [1993] UKHL  8  fairness
   has to be assessed having regard to the  requirements  of  the  case  in
   hand.


12. For the majority of the Court of Appeal in EK (Ivory Coast) [2014]  EWCA
   Civ 1517, Sales LJ stated, at [38], that whereas in general fairness did
   not necessarily require an applicant for leave to be advised of  matters
   of which he was unaware before a decision  was  made  in  reliance  upon
   them, nevertheless there might well be unfairness where "there had  been
   a change of position of which the Secretary  of  State  was  aware,  and
   indeed which she had  brought  about,  in  circumstances  in  which  the
   students were not themselves at fault in any way, but  had  been  caught
   out by action taken by the Secretary of State in relation to which  they
   had had no opportunity to protect themselves". Where though "the general
   unfairness which the Appellant has suffered ... is the result of actions
   and omissions by" a Sponsor [25],  there  is  no  claim  for  unfairness
   resulting from the subsequent decision making of the Secretary of State.




13. Whatever misfortune the Appellant may have suffered lies at the door  of
   the College which disappointed him, and is not a matter  for  which  the
   Secretary of State bears any responsibility.


14. No Human Rights Convention ground has been pursued.




          Decision:

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  did  not  contain  a  material
    error of law.
    The appeal is dismissed.
