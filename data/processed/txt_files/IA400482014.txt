                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appellant

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh born on 10 October 1988 and he
    appeals against a decision of the respondent to  refuse  him  leave  to
    enter and remain in the UK in a decision dated 25 December  2014.   The
    appellant had been given leave to remain in the UK as a Tier 4  student
    on 6 March 2014 but, when considering the cancellation of his leave  to
    enter, an Immigration Officer was satisfied that false  representations
    were employed or material facts were not disclosed for the  purpose  of
    obtaining leave in a previous application.  The  appellant's  leave  to
    remain was cancelled in accordance with paragraph 321A of HC 395 of the
    Immigration Rules, as amended and he was refused leave to enter the  UK
    under paragraph 320(7B) of HC 395 (as amended).

 2. The history is that the  appellant  arrived  at  Gatwick  North  on  10
    October 2014 from Dhaka.  His passport contained a UK Tier 4  (General)
    Student entry clearance issued in Dhaka on 13 October 2009 valid  until
    31 October 2012.  In October 2012 the appellant submitted documents  in
    support of a further application to remain and leave was granted  valid
    from 18th February 2013 to 1st March 2014.  He was again granted  leave
    valid from 6th March 2014  to  30th  October  2015.   It  was  for  the
    application dated 31st October 2012 that the appellant had submitted  a
    test certificate from an ETS language test.

 3. Home Office records showed that the appellant  had  taken  part  in  an
    educational testing services, ETS English  language  test,  at  a  test
    centre which was later suspended.

 4. In a decision dated 17 October 2014 it was stated  that  the  appellant
    was given notice of leave to remain in the United Kingdom as a  student
    on 6 March 2014 but the Secretary of State  was  satisfied  that  false
    representations were employed or material facts not disclosed  and  his
    leave was cancelled.  It was the appellant's claim  that  he  took  the
    test on 5 September 2012 at what he stated to be North London  College.
    He was granted further leave in the UK  in  2013  and  used  the  TOEIC
    English language course which was an  ETS  establishment  to  take  the
    course.

 5. Home Office records show that the appellant had taken  part  in  a  ETS
    English language test and that from February 2014 any student  visa  or
    entry clearance application supported by evidence  of  English  ability
    issued by ETS was placed  on  hold.   ETS  undertook  analysis  of  the
    speaking test and those results were split into two, those  which  were
    invalid and those which were questionable.

 6. The appellant appealed that decision of cancellation.  He  stated  that
    he had successfully completed an English course awarded by EDI UK,  HND
    in Business from EdExcel  and  BSc  in  Business  Management  from  the
    University of Wales and was currently  a  student  of  the  Masters  of
    Business Administration at Cardiff Metropolitan University and achieved
    these  through  his  studies  in  English  language.    The   appellant
    maintained that he did not use deception to obtain the English language
    certificate in September 2012 and he should not  be  personally  liable
    for the conduct of the language test.  It was submitted the  respondent
    was therefore required to provide clear, cogent and consistent evidence
    to show that the appellant submitted false documents.

 7. In the event First-tier Tribunal Judge Andonian allowed the appellant's
    appeal on the following basis:

         "5.  I am concerned about this matter because none of  the  witness
             statements or anything  that  the  Home  Office  had  produced
             proved that this appellant was a party to a scam.  It may very
             well be the case that other persons were involved in a scam in
             relation to taking this English Language test on the day  that
             it was taken 5.9.2012 at that test centre, but  this  did  not
             certainly mean that this appellant was also a party to a scam.
              There was no evidence against him personally.  The  appellant
             had successfully completed his English language course and was
             awarded by the EDI, UK his HND in business from  EdExcel,  BSc
             (Hons) in Business management from the University of Wales and
             currently  he  was  a  student  of  the  Master  of   Business
             Administration at Cardiff Metropolitan University and  he  has
             paid a tuition fee  of  ï¿½5,450.   All  this  he  had  achieved
             through his studies and all his  exams  were  in  the  English
             language.  Before me he appeared and  gave  evidence  and  his
             English was fluent.  As he said  when  he  took  the  test  on
             5.9.2012, he was fluent in the language and there was no  need
             for him to employ deception or to use someone else to  provide
             the test for him.  He had never made a false representation in
             his application by submitting a false  English  Language  test
             certificate and I  believe  that  this  is  the  case  as  the
             respondent  has  not  proved  otherwise.   The  appellant  had
             submitted that the respondent is completely wrong  by  holding
             that he had made a false representation in his application  by
             submitting a false English language test.

         6.   The appellant also stated that he had never used deception  to
             obtain an English Language test, he said  before  me  that  he
             genuinely  sat  the  exam  and  successfully   completed   the
             assessment and obtained the certificate.  He was asked when he
             had taken the test, where he was living at that  time  and  he
             said he was living at Bow Road, East London E3.  He said  that
             it took about 40 minutes to go from Bow  Road  to  the  Queens
             College where he took the test on 5.9.2012.  He said  that  he
             took bus number 205 to Liverpool Street and then he  took  the
             train to Walthamstow.  He was asked why he did not take a test
             at a centre which was nearer and he said that he could not get
             a place to take the  test  earlier  than  he  wanted  to,  and
             therefore the centre that he took the test at on 5.9.2012  was
             the earliest that he could take the test at as  other  centres
             had a longer waiting list.

         7.   The appellant appeared to be a very  credible  individual;  he
             asserted that he had never committed any criminal offence  and
             had not submitted any false documentation.  I believe that the
             cancellation of this continued leave to remain on such grounds
             had been absolutely without any basis and such cancellation is
             fundamentally flawed."

 8. An application for permission to appeal was made by  the  Secretary  of
    State in the following  terms.   The  Immigration  Officer  provided  a
    bundle of documents in  support  of  the  allegation  together  with  a
    further witness statement from Matthew Harold with an extract from  the
    ETS spreadsheet  which  was  provided  at  the  hearing.   The  witness
    statements from Mr Peter Millington and Miss  Rebecca  Collins  clearly
    provided that the tests were categorised  as  "invalid"  but  ETS  were
    certain that there is evidence of proxy test taking or impersonation.

 9. In order to be categorised as invalid on the  spreadsheet  provided  to
    the Home Office the case must be  gone  through  a  computer  programme
    analysing speech and then two independent voice analysts.  If all three
    were in agreement that a proxy had been used then  the  test  would  be
    categorised as invalid.

10. In the light of the evidence it was clear that the Secretary  of  State
    reasonably concluded that the  appellant  had  used  deception  in  his
    application and that the judge had erred in its finding at paragraph  9
    that the respondent  had  failed  to  discharge  the  burden  of  proof
    incumbent upon her on the civil standard.

11. First-tier Tribunal Judge Pirotta granted permission on the basis  that
    the judge disregarded the evidence in statement form from the Secretary
    of State and there was arguably a material error of law.

12. At the hearing Mr Palash  attended  and  confirmed  that  he  made  his
    application for further leave to remain on 31 October 2012 and for that
    he used a TOEIC for which  he  sat  a  test  on  5  September  2012  at
    Queensway Test Centre, E17.

13. He stated that the Home Office Presenting  Officer  had  cross-examined
    him at the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal  and  the  judge  had
    decided that his English was good.  The appellant had conducted his HND
    in English and gone on to undertake a Business  Management  degree  and
    had recently finished a masters.

14. Mr Tufan submitted that the appellant's grasp of English  now  was  not
    the same as it might have been previously and there may be many reasons
    for him taking an exam which used a proxy.

15. In conclusion, despite the fact that the  judge  had  referred  to  the
    statement from Matthew Harold employed by the Home Office and he stated
    that the test results had been obtained via the use of a proxy  tester,
    (paragraph 3 of the judge's decision) the  judge  made  no  attempt  to
    analyse that statement.   The  judge  stated  at  paragraph  5,  "I  am
    concerned about this matter because none of the witness  statements  or
    anything that the Home Office had produced prove  that  this  appellant
    was a party to a scam" but the evidence of Matthew Harold  specifically
    referred to Takmal Uddin Palash'  the appellant' and the  judge  failed
    to acknowledge this.

16. I also note that although at paragraph 9  the  judge  referred  to  the
    burden of proof as resting with the respondent  and  that  it  was  the
    civil standard, the judge also referred  to  the  "higher  standard  of
    proof incumbent upon the respondent to discharge that  he  had  been  a
    party to a scam".

17. As such I found an error  of  law  which  is  material.   NA  &  Others
    (Cambridge College of Learning) Pakistan [2009]  UKAIT  00031  confirms
    that the standard of proof to be applied in these cases  is  the  civil
    standard, albeit that good evidence may be required.

18. The appellant had his leave to remain cancelled by  the  respondent  on
    the basis that he had made false representations in a previous leave to
    remain application.   The  appellant  accepted  that  he  had  attended
    Queensway College on 5 September 2012 and in the  spreadsheet  attached
    to the statement that Mr Tufan supplied it is  quite  clear  that  this
    individual appellant's date of birth of 10 October 1988 from Bangladesh
    had attended Queensway College for testing, and  that  his  certificate
    number was 0044201925  and the test records 34427 and 34428  associated
    with the appellant's certificate number  (tests  taken  on  05/09/2012)
    were classified as invalid.

19. The case of R (on the application of) Gazi v Secretary of State for the
    Home Department (ETS - Judicial review) IJR  [2015]  UKUT  00327  (IAC)
    addresses whether the statements of Miss  Collings  and  Mr  Millington
    constitute generic evidence and goes through analysis of the  detection
    of fraudulent testing at some length and the approach  taken.   Various
    criticisms were made of the process undertaken by the  Home  Office  in
    Gazi and it is stated at [9]

         "At this juncture, it is appropriate to highlight the single  piece
         of documentary evidence relating to the decision in the Applicant's
         case which has  been  produced  by  the  Secretary  of  State.   It
         consists of a photocopied excerpt from  a  spreadsheet  taking  the
         form of a horizontal line containing six pieces of information: the
         "ETS Registration ID", the Applicant's first and  last  names,  the
         test date, the Applicant's date of birth and the name of  the  test
         centre.  Neither  the  word  "invalid"  or  "cancellation"  or  any
         derivative of either appears".

    And at [15] with respect to the conclusions of the analyses made of the
    tests,

         'The dichotomy of "invalidity" and "irregularity"  is  identifiable
         in the immediately ensuing averments:

             "Where a match  has  not  been  identified  and  verified,  an
             individual's test result may still be invalidated on the basis
             of test administration irregularity including  the  fact  that
             their test was taken at a UK  testing  centre  where  numerous
             other results have been invalidated on the basis of a 'match'.
              In those cases the individual would  usually  be  invited  to
             take a free re-test.  These cases are clearly distinguished by
             ETS in its spreadsheets provided to the Home Office from tests
             where there is substantial evidence of invalidity."

         No exhibited illustration of this  distinction,  even  in  redacted
         form, is provided.   Finally,  it  is  clear  from  the  concluding
         averments in Mr Millington's witness statement that the Home Office
         invariably accepts the deception assessment provided by ETS,without
         more".

20. However, the Tribunal considered that each case would  be  assessed  on
    its merits and, at [35], Mr Justice McCloskey in Gazi states:

         "In my view, taking  into  account  chapter  50  of  the  EIG,  the
         respondent's  evidence,  summarised  in  chapter   2   above,   was
         sufficient to warrant the assessment that the applicant's TOEIC had
         been  procured  by  deception  and,  thus,  provided  an   adequate
         foundation for the decision made under Section 10 of the 1990 Act".

21. On the basis of the  evidence  put  before  me  there  was  a  definite
    reference to two test records and as to whether they were classified as
    invalid or questionable and both tests were recorded as  'invalid'.   I
    accept that the evidence has demonstrated that the test  was  cancelled
    because of invalidity and further to paragraph 8  of  Matthew  Harold's
    statement the test was invalidated  because  the  same  individual  had
    taken an English language test in place  of  numerous  candidates.   As
    paragraph 8 states, "as in this case, ETS then informed the Home Office
    that  there  was  evidence  of  invalidity  in  those  case  and  where
    applicable that it had cancelled the test result".

22. It was made clear in Gazi that

         'the bona fides  and  character  of  the  Applicant  are  important
         issues.   However,  there  was  no  opportunity  to  evaluate   the
         Applicant's demeanour or to  assess  his  performance  under  cross
         examination'

23. The English of the appellant at the date of the hearing before  me  and
    any subsequent courses he has taken are not an indicator of the English
    of the appellant when he took the test over three years ago. I  am  not
    persuaded that the lack of  a  criminal  record  on  the  part  of  the
    appellant  is  a  good  indicator  that  the  appellant  did  not  take
    participate in an invalid test.  I would not  conclude,  as  the  First
    tier Tribunal Judge did, that  the  appellant's  speaking  English  was
    fluent even at the date of the hearing.  I therefore, on the balance of
    probabilities with the supporting evidence find that the respondent had
    established a  condition  precedent  and  subsequently  discharged  the
    burden of proof required and the appellant's appeal is dismissed.

Notice of Decision

The Judge erred materially for the reasons  identified.   I  set  aside  the
decision  pursuant  to  Section  12(2)(a)  of  the  Tribunals   Courts   and
Enforcement Act 2007 (TCE 2007) and remake the decision under section  12(2)
(b) (ii) of the TCE 2007 and dismiss the appeal of Mr Palash.
