Representation:
For the Appellant:     in person
For the Respondent:    Mr P Deller, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


      1. For the reasons given below, I set aside the decision of First-tier
         Tribunal Judge Housego to be remade:


             1.   In a  decision  promulgated  on  25th  August  2017,  the
             appellants appeal against the respondent's decision to  deport
             him in accordance with the EEA regulations 2016 was dismissed.


             2.   Permission to appeal was  given  by  First-tier  Tribunal
             judge Gibb on the grounds that it was arguable that First-tier
             Tribunal judge Housego had failed to make  a  finding  on  the
             length of time the appellant had been resident in the  UK  and
             had failed to refer to anything  other  than  the  appellant's
             convictions when  considering  whether  the  appellant  was  a
             genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat.


             3.    The  First-tier  Tribunal  judge's  decision   discounts
             evidence of the appellant's presence in the UK for a number of
             years; appears to require evidence for each and every  day  of
             the claimed 15 years residence and fails to accord any  weight
             to evidence that was before him in asserting  that  there  was
             'no evidence'  of  residence  for  some  years.  There  is  no
             significant reasoning on  the  issues  of  proportionality  or
             current risk.


             4.   I am satisfied the First-tier Tribunal judge erred in law
             if failing to reach a decision  in  accordance  with  the  EEA
             Regulations.


             5.   I set aside the decision to be remade.


    Uncontentious or unchallenged background facts


      2. Mr Dos Santos is a citizen of Portugal,  born  18  April  1978.  He
         claims to have been continuously in the UK since 2002 save  for  an
         absence of about 7 months when he was in Angola.


      3. In 2004 the appellant met his first wife Yolanda  Maria  De  Barros
         Alberto, an Angolan national. On 14th March 2005 he was issued with
         a Residence Permit valid until March 2010; his spouse was issued  a
         residence permit in line, after a successful appeal,  at  the  same
         time. That marriage broke down  after  a  year  and  it  seems  she
         returned to Angola. They were subsequently divorced.


      4. Mr Dos Santos' current partner, Claudirene Nunes  De  Souza,  is  a
         Brazilian national.


      5. In 2010, the appellant travelled to Angola to visit his  family  in
         2010. Whilst there he had a motorbike accident  and  spent  over  6
         months in hospital. He broke his jaw, lost the bottom  row  of  his
         teeth and had a metal plate  fitted.  He  returned  to  the  UK  in
         February 2011.


      6. In September 2012, Ms de Souza applied for a  residence  permit  as
         the unmarried  partner  of  the  appellant.  That  application  was
         refused; her appeal against that decision was  successful  in  July
         2013 and she was issued with a residence permit as the dependant of
         the appellant, valid until 11 December 2018.


      7. The respondent, for reasons set out in  her  letter  dated  4  July
         2017, decided to make a deportation  order.  She  stated  that  she
         accepted that he had been  resident  in  accordance  with  the  EEA
         Regulations 2016 for a continuous period of 5  years  but  did  not
         accept that he was entitled to enhanced protection because  he  had
         failed to provide evidence of lawful residence for 10  years  prior
         to  his  imprisonment.  By  letter  dated  7  February  2018,   the
         respondent withdrew her concession  that  he  had  been  exercising
         Treaty Rights for a continuous period of five years.


      8. The evidence regarding exercise of Treaty Rights is as follows:


           . Letter from HMRC dated 11 October 2017 records earnings and NI
             contributions for each of the years 2003/4 until  2016/17  but
             states there are no records of earnings  or  NI  contributions
             for the years 2007/8, 2010/11, 2011/12 2013/14 and 2015/16.
           . Tax calculation from HM revenue and Customs year ended 5 April
             2011 showing gross profit from self-employment of  �6565  with
             overpaid income tax of �121.
           . Solmaz printout statement 24/04/2012  showing  gross  payments
             for the weeks 14/03/11 to 03/04/11 of �825 total.
           . Tax calculation from HMRC year  ended  5  April  2012  showing
             gross  profit  from  self-employment  of   �10,120   with   an
             overpayment of �61.45 income tax.
           . Some  bank  statements  are  produced.  The  appellant's  bank
             statements in the bundle for November 2011, December 2011 show
             credits from Solmaz and from Candeias for  painting  services.
             Bank statements for June to September  2012,  July  2015  show
             deposits from Solmaz
           . There are invoices from the appellant to Solmaz  for  services
             during the majority of weeks in 2011.
           . Tax calculation from HMRC for year ended 5 April 2013  showing
             profit from  self-employment  of  �7785  with  overpayment  of
             income tax of �1313.80.
           . A letter from  Solmaz  dated  20th  August  2012  stating  the
             appellant has been working for  them  self-employed  since  18
             June 2012.
           . HMRC Tax calculation for year ended 5 April 2014 showing self-
             employed earnings of �7692 with no income tax due.
           . HMRC Tax calculation for  year  ended  5  April  2015  showing
             combined pay and self-employed income of �14,476 with overpaid
             income tax of �3.80.
           . HMRC tax calculation for  year  ended  5  April  2016  showing
             income from self-employment of �10,800.


      9. Mr Dos Santos has three convictions and one caution:

    Discussion


     10. The respondent does not, in her letter of  4th  July  2017,  accept
         that the appellant has been resident in  the  UK  since  2002.  She
         states there is no evidence of his entry in 2002  and  that  during
         the course of his interview with Immigration Officials in  February
         2011 he had said he was travelling with his girlfriend to the UK as
         visitors and would then be  returning  to  Portugal  where  he  was
         resident. The appellant disputes that was what he said. His partner
         Ms de Souza, a  national  of  brazil,  sought  and  was  refused  a
         residence permit  as  the  appellant's  dependant.  In  the  appeal
         against the refusal of a  residence  permit,  heard  in  2013,  the
         appellant gave evidence; he and Ms de Souza said they were resident
         in the UK,  not  Portugal.  The  judge  specifically  records  that
         evidence was unchallenged in cross examination. The  appellant  was
         not cross examined before me in connection  with  the  respondent's
         assertion that the appellant had said he was resident in  Portugal.
         I accept the appellant's evidence that he (and his  partner  Ms  de
         Souza) were not residing in Portugal.


     11. The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Phull in  Ms  De  Souza's
         appeal in 2013 states:


             "33. Turning to the issue of  the  sponsor  exercising  treaty
             rights in the UK I find as follows.  There  was  a  wealth  of
             documentary  evidence  in  the  appellant's  bundle  that  the
             sponsor  is  working  on  a  self-employed  basis  for  Solmaz
             Limited.  None  of  this  evidence  was  challenged  in  cross
             -examination.


             34.  A letter from Vertice Accountancy and  Consultancy  dated
             24 January 2013  (page  112,  appellant's  bundle)  state  the
             sponsor [Mr Dos Santos] is a self employed builder since  2005
             and provide details of his SAR for  2010-2011  and  2011-2012.
             Copies of his invoices date back to 2011 are at pages  158  to
             191. Copies pf  the  sponsor's  [Mr  Dos  Santos']  HMRC  self
             -assessment returns are at pages  100-157.  A  statement  from
             Solmaz provides details of the sponsor's gross pay at page 99.
             The sponsor's bank statements show corresponding credits  into
             the account from Solmaz. The evidence of the sponsor  is  that
             he works for Solmaz on a self-employed basis. Evidence of  the
             HSBC credit slips at pages 285 to 307.


             35.  Having considered all this evidence in the round  I  find
             on balance that the sponsor is exercising Treaty Rights in the
             UK as a self-employed builder..."


     12. Mr Dos Santos, in oral evidence in fluent English, said that he had
         some difficulty remembering dates following the injury  in  Angola.
         He said he had been working in the UK as a  self-employed  builder.
         When he first arrived in the UK, because of language  difficulties,
         he worked with his father who would then pay him in cash.  He  said
         he also worked with his partner (who is employed as a cleaner) when
         he had no building work. He said he had arrived in the UK  in  2002
         and started work with a  temporary  national  insurance  number  in
         2003. His permanent number had arrived in  2003.  He  said  he  had
         worked most years.


     13. The letter  from  HMRC  dated  11  October  2017  does  not  record
         employers or  NI  contributions  for  a  number  of  periods.  This
         information is contradicted by the HMRC  Tax  calculations  in  the
         bundle. It is also contradicted by  the  information  in  the  bank
         statements that are produced for the years 2011, 2012 and  2015.  I
         note that not all bank statements for all those years are  produced
         and I take that into account. I also  note  that  the  letter  from
         Solmaz states the appellant started working for them in  June  2012
         however it is plain from the bank statements that the appellant had
         been working for them on  a  self-employed  basis  prior  to  that.
         Although the documents that were before Judge Phull were not before
         me I note that the judge  considered  there  to  be  a  "wealth  of
         evidence" of self-employment and makes specific reference to  self-
         employment during the years  2010  to  2012.  Again,  although  not
         before me, the judge  refers  to  the  letter  from  Vertice  which
         confirms that the appellant has been a self-employed builder  since
         2005. This evidence was not challenged by  the  respondent  in  the
         First-tier Tribunal decision before Judge  Phull  nor  was  it  re-
         opened as a challenge before me.


     14. A letter from Solmaz dated 28 September 2016 confirms the appellant
         is working for them on a self-employed basis earning in the  region
         of �550 per week. It does not say how long he has been working  for
         them but says it foresees him working for them for the  foreseeable
         future.


     15. There is no explanation why the letter from HMRC should be at  odds
         with the HMRC tax  calculations.  The  tax  calculations  were  not
         challenged as inaccurate or unreliable by Mr Deller. Taking all the
         evidence together, including Judge Phull's findings, and  the  lack
         of any submission that the tax calculations are unreliable, I  find
         the appellant has been employed/self-employed since June 2003  (the
         date on the HMRC that he  entered  the  NI  scheme).  Although  his
         income is on the low side, I take into account the fact that he  is
         living with his partner and expenses are shared - as to  which  see
         below. There is no requirement to show income for  each  and  every
         week of residence; he is self-employed and income  of  that  nature
         does vary. The bank statements that are produced show  deposits  of
         income on a fairly regular basis although I do  take  note  of  the
         fact that bank statements  for  the  whole  period  have  not  been
         produced. Taking all  the  evidence  of  finance  and  income  into
         account, I find the appellant has  been  exercising  Treaty  Rights
         since the middle of 2003 save when he was in Angola from  early  to
         mid 2010 until February 2011 and during the time he was  in  prison
         serving his criminal sentence/ in immigration detention  from  late
         2016 until early 2017.


     16. It follows that Mr Dos Santos has been permanently resident in  the
         UK for a period of five years, exercising Treaty Rights and is thus
         entitled to the "second" level of protection.


     17. The appellant has three offences committed during a short period of
         time March 2015 to November 2016. They were committed, he says,  in
         order to fund his drug habit. He had, according to  the  sentencing
         remarks that activated  the  suspended  sentence  and  led  to  his
         consecutive  sentences  of  8  months  and  3  months,   previously
         completed a drug rehabilitation course.


     18. The unchallenged evidence from the appellant, supported by a letter
         dated 5 March 2018 was that  he  is  currently  admitted  to  Remar
         Association UK for a recommended minimum period of 12 months. Remar
         is a residential centre assisting people with  drug  addiction  and
         alcoholism. During his stay with them his basic needs such as food,
         accommodation, clothing and health are met. In his  oral  evidence,
         unchallenged, the appellant  expressed  his  deep  regret  for  the
         offences committed; that evidence and his witness statement set out
         the problems he had as a child  and  adolescent  but,  although  no
         excuse whatsoever for the criminal  behaviour  was,  he  said,  the
         reason behind his drug addiction. He was,  he  said,  committed  to
         dealing with his drug addiction and that was why  he  had  referred
         himself to Remar. I am satisfied the appellant genuinely intends to
         address his addiction and his  self-referral  to  Remar  is  strong
         supportive evidence of this.


     19.  The  appellant's  partner,  who  required  an  interpreter,   gave
         unchallenged  evidence  that  she  was  working.  The  unchallenged
         evidence from the couple was that their relationship continued  and
         although they were currently not living  together  because  of  the
         appellant's admission to  Remar,  the  relationship  continued  and
         would continue; they have been living together since 2009,  sharing
         expenses. They  anticipated  that  as  he  progressed  through  the
         rehabilitation programme he would be given leave to spend more time
         together and she would come to Hamilton, where he was staying. I am
         satisfied the relationship between the appellant and  Ms  de  Souza
         remains intact and that she is genuinely supportive of  him.  I  am
         satisfied that but for the fact that he is currently likely  to  be
         living  at  Remar  for  the  next  10-12  months,  they  would   be
         cohabiting. I am satisfied they intend to  resume  living  together
         when he leaves Remar and that  despite  their  physical  separation
         they continue to maintain a genuine and subsisting relationship.


     20. The appellant's parents returned to Angola in 2006  or  2007  where
         they remain living. The appellant, again in unchallenged  evidence,
         says he has a difficult relationship  with  his  father  since  his
         latest conviction and his drug addiction. In unchallenged  evidence
         he says he has visited his parents on that one  occasion  and  only
         stayed the time he did because  of  the  serious  accident  he  had
         whilst there. He has made a holiday visit to Portugal  since  being
         in the UK, but no more.


     21. The respondent in  the  decision  letter  refers  to  the  lack  of
         evidence that the appellant has adequately  addressed  the  reasons
         for his offending behaviour or undergone  any  appropriate  courses
         whilst in prison or addressed  the  issues  that  prompted  him  to
         offend. There was no evidence that the appellant  had  undergone  a
         Victim Awareness Course or Enhanced Thinking Course.  The  evidence
         now is that he is tackling his drug problem  and  although  only  a
         short time has elapsed since this commenced he self-  referred  and
         is complying. I accept that  unchallenged  evidence  and,  as  said
         above, I find that he has a genuine intention to  combat  his  drug
         addiction.


     22. The appellant was born in Luanda, Angola  and  acquired  Portuguese
         nationality through his father. He lived in  Angola  until  he  was
         aged 10 where he went to school until aged 16.  He came to the  UK,
         with his father, in 2002/3 aged about 24. His unchallenged evidence
         is that for the last two offences  he  handed  himself  in  to  the
         police and confessed.


     23. The evidence of family in either Portugal or Uganda is  limited.  I
         accept that he has  limited  contact  with  his  family  in  Angola
         following his convictions but I note that in his witness  statement
         the appellant says he did receive support from his father when  his
         drug addiction was first  disclosed  to  him  when  they  lived  in
         Portugal. I take the  view  that  although  there  may  be  limited
         contact now, his father has previously shown  himself  to  have  at
         least some sympathy and that their relationship is capable of being
         rebuilt. In any event the appellant is now nearly 40 years old,  an
         adult who has worked and supported himself and his partner for many
         years despite his drug addiction. When he was 16 he had a  paternal
         grandmother in Portugal. Although there was  no  evidence  to  that
         effect she is either very elderly now or deceased. There  has  been
         no mention of any other relatives in Portugal but, as  in  relation
         to Angola, the appellant is some 40 years old, has  worked,  speaks
         Portuguese and English fluently and there is no reason  to  suggest
         that he would not be able  to  re-establish  himself  in  Portugal.
         There is reference to some relatives in the UK but  there  were  no
         letters of support or assistance from them  .I  am  satisfied  that
         whether relationships as do exist with un-named  relatives  in  the
         UK, they are not of such importance that they have any  bearing  on
         his life in the UK.


     24. The appellant's criminal offending has been  of  relatively  recent
         origin. He has lived in the UK since at least 2003,  worked  almost
         consistently throughout that time with the same  firm  as  a  self-
         employed worker. His relationship, which remains strong, was formed
         in 2009, many years before his criminal offending.


     25. The appellant has been in the UK for some 15-16  years.  He  speaks
         fluent English. He has worked. He has a strong relationship with  a
         partner whom he met here in the  UK.   Although  criminal  offences
         which lead to a custodial sentence may be indicative of a  lack  of
         integration, I am satisfied that  in  this  case,  given  the  more
         recent offending and its level and frequency, that the  appellant's
         offending does not displace the  level  of  integration  previously
         shown through his work and residence.


     26. Although the root cause of his criminal offending was his  personal
         drug addiction, the criminal offences for which  he  "gave  himself
         up" were directed to enable him to  support  that  habit  and  thus
         indirectly related to drugs. There is no  suggestion  that  he  was
         involved in drug offences with intent to supply and he has not been
         convicted of, or charged with, any specific drug related charges of
         possession.  Although  misuse  of  drugs  unquestionably  leads  to
         societal harm, even indirectly, the appellant's crimes  are  crimes
         for which he has been punished as society demands.


     27. The decision leading to the appellant's deportation order can  only
         be taken on serious grounds of public policy and  public  security.
         It must be taken in accordance with the following principles:


           . Must comply with the principle of proportionality;
           . Must be based exclusively  on  the  personal  conduct  of  the
             person concerned;
           . The personal conduct must represent  a  genuine,  present  and
             sufficiently serious threat affecting on  of  the  fundamental
             interest of society, taking into account past conduct  of  the
             person and that the threat does not need to be imminent;
           . Matters isolated from the particulars of  the  case  or  which
             relate to considerations  of  general  prevention  do  not  in
             themselves justify the decision;
           .  Previous  convictions  do  not  in  themselves  justify   the
             decision;
           . The decision may be taken on preventative grounds even in  the
             absence of a previous criminal conviction provided the grounds
             are specific to the person;
           . Must take into account the age, health,  family  and  economic
             situation,  length   of   residence,   social   and   cultural
             integration and links with country of origin.
           . In deciding whether the  requirements  are  met  the  decision
             maker must have regard to the  considerations  in  Schedule  1
             Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016[1].


     28.  The  respondent  in  her  decision  relies  upon  the  appellant's
         offending behaviour  and  in  particular  the  number  of  offences
         committed over a relatively short period of time, their  escalating
         nature and that the  last  offence  was  committed  whilst  he  was
         subject to a suspended sentence.


     29. Mr Deller's core submission was that the criminal offending of  the
         appellant, related as it was to drugs, was a fundamental threat  to
         the interest of society, the  threshold  was  met  and  the  appeal
         should be dismissed.


     30. As can be seen above, although the appellant's  criminal  offending
         is related to drugs, they are not drug offences. His  offending  is
         relatively recent and although they will have  caused  considerable
         and serious stress and anxiety to the victims, as  all  criminality
         does, I am satisfied  for  the  reasons  given  above  that  he  is
         addressing his criminality and the cause of his criminality. I have
         taken all the evidence before me into account and in particular the
         interests of society. The appellant's last offending was recent and
         of a similar nature to his earlier  offences.  Nevertheless,  I  do
         accept that, given his self-referral to serious rehabilitation, the
         length of time he has been in the UK, his integration into  British
         society, the strength of his longstanding relationship and all  the
         factors above, that he is not a genuine, present  and  sufficiently
         serious threat affecting the fundamental interests of  society.  It
         will be noted that I have found that the threshold test to be  met,
         because of the length of time that he has  been  exercising  Treaty
         Rights, is that there must be serious grounds of public policy.  It
         follows from my findings that given he  does  not  meet  the  lower
         threshold, he cannot meet the threshold set of "serious".


     31. I allow the appeal.


    Conclusions:


    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.


    I set aside the decision


    I re-make the decision in the appeal by allowing it.

                                    Annex

SCHEDULE 1

CONSIDERATIONS OF PUBLIC POLICY, PUBLIC SECURITY AND THE FUNDAMENTAL
INTERESTS OF SOCIETY ETC.


    Considerations of public policy and public security


    1.   The EU Treaties do not impose a uniform scale of public policy  or
    public security values: member States  enjoy  considerable  discretion,
    acting within the parameters set by  the  EU  Treaties,  applied  where
    relevant by the EEA agreement, to define their own standards of  public
    policy and public security, for purposes tailored to  their  individual
    contexts, from time to time.


    Application of paragraph 1 to the United Kingdom


    2.   An EEA national or the family member of  an  EEA  national  having
    extensive  familial  and  societal  links  with  persons  of  the  same
    nationality or language does not amount to integration  in  the  United
    Kingdom;  a  significant  degree  of  wider   cultural   and   societal
    integration must  be  present  before  a  person  may  be  regarded  as
    integrated in the United Kingdom.


    3.   Where an EEA national or the family member of an EEA national  has
    received a custodial sentence, or is a persistent offender, the  longer
    the sentence, or the more numerous the  convictions,  the  greater  the
    likelihood that the  individual's  continued  presence  in  the  United
    Kingdom represents a genuine, present and sufficiently  serious  threat
    affecting of the fundamental interests of society.


    4.   Little weight is to be attached  to  the  integration  of  an  EEA
    national or the family member of an  EEA  national  within  the  United
    Kingdom if the alleged integrating links were formed at or  around  the
    same time as-


         (a)  the commission of a criminal offence;


         (b)  an  act  otherwise  affecting  the  fundamental  interests  of
         society;


         (c)  the EEA national or family member of an EEA  national  was  in
         custody.


    5.   The removal from the United Kingdom of  an  EEA  national  or  the
    family member of an EEA national who is  able  to  provide  substantive
    evidence  of  not  demonstrating  a  threat   (for   example,   through
    demonstrating that the EEA national or the  family  member  of  an  EEA
    national has successfully reformed or rehabilitated) is less likely  to
    be proportionate.


    6.    It  is  consistent  with  public  policy  and   public   security
    requirements in the United Kingdom that EEA decisions may be  taken  in
    order to refuse, terminate or withdraw any right otherwise conferred by
    these Regulations in the case of abuse of rights or fraud, including-


         (a)  entering, attempting to enter or assisting another  person  to
         enter or to attempt to enter,  a  marriage,  civil  partnership  or
         durable partnership of convenience; or


         (b)  fraudulently obtaining or attempting to obtain,  or  assisting
         another to obtain or to attempt to obtain, a right to reside  under
         these Regulations.
         The fundamental interests of society


    7.   For the purposes of these Regulations, the  fundamental  interests
    of society in the United Kingdom include-


         (a)  preventing unlawful immigration and abuse of  the  immigration
         laws, and  maintaining  the  integrity  and  effectiveness  of  the
         immigration control system (including under these Regulations)  and
         of the Common Travel Area;


         (b)  maintaining public order;


         (c)  preventing social harm;


         (d)  preventing the evasion of taxes and duties;


         (e)  protecting public services;


         (f)  excluding or removing an EEA national or family member  of  an
         EEA national with a conviction (including where the conduct of that
         person is likely to cause, or has in fact caused,  public  offence)
         and maintaining public confidence in the ability  of  the  relevant
         authorities to take such action;


         (g)  tackling offences likely to cause harm  to  society  where  an
         immediate or direct victim may be difficult to identify  but  where
         there is wider societal harm  (such  as  offences  related  to  the
         misuse of drugs or crime with a cross-border dimension as mentioned
         in Article 83(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of  the  European
         Union);


         (h)  combating the effects of persistent offending (particularly in
         relation to offences, which if taken in isolation, may otherwise be
         unlikely to meet the requirements of regulation 27);


         (i)  protecting the rights and  freedoms  of  others,  particularly
         from exploitation and trafficking;


         (j)  protecting the public;


         (k)  acting in the best interests of a child (including where doing
         so entails refusing a child admission to  the  United  Kingdom,  or
         otherwise taking an EEA decision against a child);


         (l)  countering  terrorism  and  extremism  and  protecting  shared
         values.
