For the Appellant:      Mr Salam, Salam & Co
For the Respondent:    Mr Harrison, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS











 1. The Appellants are both nationals of Namibia. They are mother and minor
    son, born in 2010. They appeal with  permission  the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal (Judge Foudy) to dismiss  their  appeals  on  human
    rights grounds.


 2. The case before the First-tier Tribunal was that  the  First  Appellant
    was in a stable relationship with a Mr Mudage, a British citizen.  They
    lived together with the Second Appellant and together shared  a  family
    life such as to engage Article 8 ECHR.

 3. The Respondent did not accept that  any  of  the  various  sections  of
    Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules were in play and found that absent
    exceptional circumstances leave should be refused.

 4. In a succinct determination Judge Foudy found as follows:

           a) The First Appellant could  not  hope  to  succeed  under  the
              'partner' route in Appendix FM because her relationship  with
              Mr Mudage did not meet the definition of 'unmarried  partner'
              in GEN.1.2;


           b) The First Appellant could  not  hope  to  succeed  under  the
              'parent' route inter alia because the Second Appellant is not
              a qualifying child;

           c) The appeal could not be  allowed  on  the  grounds  that  the
              Second Appellant could qualify for leave  to  remain  as  the
              child of a serving member of the armed forces (his biological
              father is a Namibian serving in the British Army) because  no
              such application had been made;

           d) Neither Appellant could qualify under the provisions relating
              to private life contained in paragraph 276ADE  of  the  Rules
              because they have not  lived  here  long  enough.  The  First
              Appellant had lived here since January 2010  and  the  Second
              Appellant arrived in December 2013;

           e)  There  was  nothing  exceptional  or  compelling   in   this
              "perfectly standard family case" that would warrant  a  grant
              of leave 'outside of the rules'.


    The appeal was thereby dismissed.




 5. The Appellants sought permission to appeal  on  the  grounds  that  the
    First-tier Tribunal erred in the following respects:


              i) The couple had been living together for over two  years  at
                 the date of hearing and so the definition  in  GEN.1.2  was
                 met and it was an error to find otherwise;


             ii) The Tribunal had not complied with its statutory duty under
                 s55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 in
                 its consideration of Article 8 and/or  the  'armed  forces'
                 point;

            iii) There was a failure to conduct a full Razgar enquiry and/or
                 to give adequate reasons;


 6. In granting permission Acting Resident First-tier Tribunal Judge Zucker
    did not make reference to any of these grounds, but found  one  of  his
    own: in the record of the oral evidence Mr Mudage is noted  as  telling
    Judge Foudy that he and the First Appellant are engaged to be  married.
    In those circumstances he should have been treated as  a  fianc�,  thus
    bringing the First Appellant within the ambit of Appendix FM.




    My Findings


 7. The First Appellant and Mr Mudage started living together in July 2013.
    The applications for leave to remain were made in October 2014.  In her
    consideration of the application  the  Respondent  concluded  that  the
    couple could not yet meet any of the definitions of  'partner'  in  the
    rules relating to Article 8:
         GEN.1.2. For the purposes of this Appendix "partner" means-
         (i) the applicant's spouse;
         (ii) the applicant's civil partner;
         (iii) the applicant's fianc�(e) or proposed civil partner; or
         (iv) a person who has been living together with the applicant in a
         relationship akin to a marriage or civil partnership for at least
         two years prior to the date of application, unless a different
         meaning of partner applies elsewhere in this Appendix.




 8. The appeal was heard on the 13th January 2016. At that point the couple
    had been living together some two and half years. Mr  Salam  relies  on
    that fact to submit that at the date  of  this  in-country  appeal  the
    relevant date was the date of hearing, notwithstanding the requirements
    of paragraph GEN.1.2 (iv). He relies on paragraph GEN.1.9(a)(iii):


         GEN.1.9. In this Appendix:
         (a) the requirement to make a valid application will not apply when
         the Article 8 claim is raised:
         (i) as part of an asylum claim, or as part of a further submission
         in person after an asylum claim has been refused;
         (ii) where a migrant is in immigration detention. A migrant in
         immigration detention or their representative must submit any
         application or claim raising Article 8 to a prison officer, a
         prisoner custody officer, a detainee custody officer or a member of
         Home Office staff at the migrant's place of detention; or
             (iii) in an appeal (subject to the consent of the Secretary  of
      State where
             applicable);




 9. It appears to me that GEN.1.9 (a)(iii) is  directed  at  the  situation
    where a claimant is in the appeal process when he raises his Article  8
    claim. It obviates the need for the appeal  process  to  be  halted  in
    order that he can make his application on the right  form,  paying  the
    appropriate fee. It does not change the meaning of GEN.1.2  (iv)  which
    requires the co-habitation to have lasted at least two years  prior  to
    the application.


10. There was however, as Judge Zucker discovered from his perusal  of  the
    record of proceedings, further evidence at the date  of  hearing.  That
    was that the couple were  now  engaged.  The  definition  of  'partner'
    includes the term 'fiance' with no qualifying requirement as  to  time,
    or when the engagement needs to have been formalised.   This being  the
    apparently unchallenged evidence (the couple are in fact now  married),
    the Tribunal should  have  accepted  that  the  First  Appellant  is  a
    'partner' for the purpose of Appendix FM.

11. This error will only be such that the decision should be set  aside  if
    it can be shown to have been material to the outcome of the appeal.  Mr
    Salam was initially unable to confirm whether the Appellants could have
    produced the 'specified evidence' needed to succeed under Appendix  FM.
    He asked for more time in order to go through the papers.  This  was  a
    surprising request from a representative whose  only  purpose  in  this
    hearing was to establish that there was a material error of law in this
    determination. Presumably Mr Salam was not under  the  impression  that
    all  the  Appellant  had  to  do  was  to   fulfil   the   relationship
    requirements. It was all the more surprising given that Judge Foudy had
    admonished him for exactly the same thing at the hearing before her:

         "At the beginning of the hearing Mr Salam made an adjournment
         application to adjourn the appeal again, it already having been
         adjourned at his request in May 2015. His only reason for seeking
         an adjournment was so that he could construct one comprehensive
         bundle of the myriad of documents he has filed in the appeal. I
         refused the adjournment as if Mr Salam had wanted to 'help' the
         Tribunal in the manner he suggested he had had over 6 months in
         which to do so since the CMR..."

12.  When I refused any more time Mr  Salam  conceded  that  the  Appellant
    could not have demonstrated compliance  with  any  of  the  substantive
    requirements in Appendix FM. Although both adults in  this  family  are
    working, there was not  the  'specified  evidence'  before  either  the
    Respondent or Judge Foudy. The only way  that  the  appeal  could  have
    succeeded on this footing was with reference to EX.1. Since the  Second
    Appellant is not a 'qualifying child', having only lived in the  United
    Kingdom for just over two years at the date of the First-tier  Tribunal
    hearing, success on this ground would have required the couple to  show
    'insurmountable obstacles' to family life continuing outside the United
    Kingdom. on the evidence, this they could not do. It follows  that  the
    error in respect of GEN.1.2 was entirely immaterial.


13. The focus of Mr Salam's submissions was that the determination does not
    do enough to address s55 of the Borders,  Citizenship  and  Immigration
    Act 2009 in its Article 8 assessment. There is in fact no reference  to
    that statutory obligation in the determination. Again, whether that  it
    material is not at all clear. The Second Appellant was born in  Namibia
    in January 2010. When he was only ten months old his mother left him in
    the care of her mother and came to the United Kingdom.  He  lived  with
    his maternal grandmother until he was nearly three,  when  he  came  to
    join his mother here. At the date of the hearing he was almost five and
    had spent approximately two years in the United Kingdom. He had started
    attending school and had no  doubt  made  some  tentative  friendships.
    There is nothing in those facts which suggests that it would be in this
    child's best interests to remain in the United Kingdom.  Even  if  that
    had been established on the evidence there was nothing  to  demonstrate
    that the facts were such that they would outweigh the  public  interest
    in maintaining immigration control.

14. The strongest point for the Appellants was  the  fact  that  the  boy's
    biological father is said to be a  Namibian  national  serving  in  the
    British Army, and presumably spends some time in this country from time
    to time. There was however no evidence to indicate the  extent  of  any
    contact between them, nor whether a comparable level of  contact  would
    be possible if the child returned to Nambia.   There  was  no  arguable
    error in Judge Foudy declining to make a finding on whether the  Second
    Appellant could meet any of the requirements in Appendix Armed  Forces.
    No application had been made on that footing and there was very limited
    evidence before her.

15. The final ground concerns the reasoning on Article 8. The determination
    is brief.  There is reference to SS (Congo) v Secretary  of  State  for
    the Home Department [2015] EWCA Civ 387 and the  determination  appears
    to proceed straight to a consideration  of  proportionality.    On  the
    facts that was a perfectly adequate consideration  and  the  Appellants
    have not shown that there would have been any potential  difference  in
    the outcome had the Tribunal undertaken a step-by-step Razgar approach.
     In taking the approach that it did, the Tribunal  implicitly  accepted
    that there was a family life and there would be an interference.




    Decisions


16. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal does not contain an  error
    of law such that the decision should be set aside.

17. Neither party requested an order for anonymity and on the facts  I  see
    no reason to make one.
