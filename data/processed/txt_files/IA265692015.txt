Representation:

For the Appellant:      Mr I Jarvis, Senior Hoe Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:   In Person (assisted by the sponsor, Mr S Ahmed)

                            DECISION AND REASONS


1. I have considered whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  an
anonymity direction. No anonymity direction was made previously  in  respect
of this Appellant. Having considered all the circumstances  and  evidence  I
do not consider it necessary to make an anonymity direction.


2. The Secretary of State for the Home Department brings this appeal but  in
order to avoid confusion the parties are referred to as  they  were  in  the
First-tier Tribunal. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State  against  a
decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Adio,  promulgated  on  15th  December
2015.  Which  allowed  the  Appellant's  appeal  and  held   that   it   was
disproportionate and unlawful under Article 8 of the European Convention  on
Human Rights to remove her to Pakistan.


Background

3     The appellant was  born  on  23  March  1939  and  is  a  national  of
Pakistan.  On  18  June  2014,  the  respondent  refused   the   appellant's
application for leave to remain in the UK  out-with  the  Immigration  Rules
and decided to remove her by way of  directions  under  Section  47  of  the
Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006. The  respondent  rejected  the
appellant's claim that her case had compelling  and  compassionate  features
and took the view that the appellant's application was really an  expression
of her desire to live with her adult son in the UK.

The Judge's Decision

4     The appellant appealed to the First Tier Tribunal successfully.  First
Tier Tribunal Judge Adio  ("the  judge")  allowed  the  appeal  against  the
respondent's decision. The judge found that the appellant  is  a  vulnerable
person with mobility difficulties who now has no accommodation  in  Pakistan
and as a result, he found the respondent's decision was  a  disproportionate
breach of the appellant's Article 8 rights.

5     Grounds of  appeal  were  lodged  and,  on  12  February  2015,  Judge
Hollingworth gave permission to appeal, stating:


           "An arguable error of law has arisen in relation to  the  extent
           of the fact finding exercise  conducted  by  the  judge  as  the
           foundation for the application for Section 117".

6     In a determination promulgated on 20 May 2015,  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
Latter and I set aside the judge's decision, finding that a  material  error
of law had been made and stating at [12]:


           "We therefore reach the conclusion that the failure of the First
           Tier Tribunal to address the Immigration  Rules,  then  consider
           whether there are any good  grounds  for  considering  the  case
           outside the Rules and then set out  clearly  defined  compelling
           circumstances  constitutes  an  error  of  law.  This  error  we
           consider to be material since had the  Tribunal  conducted  this
           exercise, the outcome could have been different.  That,  in  our
           view, is the correct test to apply."


      It was directed that the decision be remade by the Upper Tribunal.

The Hearing

7     The appellant was present and although she did not give evidence,  the
proceedings were translated for her by an  interpreter.  The  appellant  was
assisted by her son, Mr Ahmed, who is the appellant's  sponsor.  On  8  June
2015, Mr Ahmed sent the following documents to the Tribunal:

            (i)  Copy savings certificates from 2008 to 2014;
            (ii) Medical test report  from  Aga  Khan  University  Hospital,


                                     Karachi;
           (iii) The appellant's son's  (the  sponsor's  brother)  passport
                 showing a visa permitting  entry  to  Saudi  Arabia  and  a
                 residence permit there; and
           (iv)  Three months' payslips for the sponsor.

8     To complete the necessary fact finding exercise, I asked  the  sponsor
questions. He then answered a number of questions in cross examination  from
Mr Jarvis. I then heard submissions from Mr Jarvis and assisted Mr Ahmed  in
making submissions before reserving my decision.

Findings of Fact

9     The appellant is the mother of the sponsor. The sponsor is  a  British
citizen who has lived in the UK since 1997.

10    The sponsor is married and has two children,  a  son  aged  14  and  a
daughter aged 9 years. The sponsor is employed as the financial director  of
a software company. He works from home. The sponsor owns the house  that  he
lives in, which is a three bedroomed house, occupied  by  the  sponsor,  his
wife, his two children and the appellant.

11    The appellant's husband died in 2009. In or  about  2012,  the  former
family home, the title to which had been in the appellant's  late  husband's
name, was sold. The money realised from that sale was invested  in  Pakistan
in the appellant's name. The appellant has approximately �28,000 in  savings
in Pakistan. Between 2009 and 2013, the appellant  lived  in  Pakistan  with
her other son (the sponsor's brother) in his house.

12. The appellant has visited the UK on five or six previous  occasions.  On
13 May 2009, the appellant was  granted  a  multi-entry  visit  visa,  valid
until 13 May 2014. The last time the appellant entered  the  UK  was  on  25
February 2014. She has remained in the UK, living with  the  sponsor,  since
then. The appellant has a third son who lives in Bradford.

13. The son with whom the appellant lived in Pakistan had been applying  for
jobs in Saudi Arabia throughout 2013. In March 2014, he secured an offer  of
employment in Saudi Arabia and, almost immediately, moved there. He now  has
a residence permit permitting him to live in Saudi  Arabia.  He  still  owns
the house (in Pakistan) in which he lived with the appellant. That  property
has now been rented to others.

14. The appellant was born in March 1939. She  is  now  76  years  old.  The
appellant suffers from high blood pressure. Since about 2008,  she  has  had
some restriction in her mobility but she is able  to  walk  short  distances
unaided. The appellant does not use a walking aid. She is able  to  mobilise
around a two storey home without difficulty. She is able to wash  and  dress
herself and is able to  pursue  the  ordinary  activities  of  daily  living
independently.

15.   Neither the appellant nor the sponsor nor  any  other  member  of  the
appellant's family has made enquiry about the availability of home  help,  a
carer or a domestic servant for  the  appellant  in  Pakistan.  Neither  the
appellant nor any member of her family have made enquiry  about  the  health
services or the care and support available to the appellant in Pakistan.

16    The appellant has savings of  more  than  the  equivalent  of  �28,000
invested in Pakistan. From that investment, she earns  approximately  60,000
rupees per month.

The Immigration Rules

17.   The appellant's application was an application for leave to remain  in
the UK outside the Rules on compassionate grounds. It is not an  application
to remain on the basis that the Immigration Rules are met. In any  event,  I
heard submissions from Mr Jarvis concerning the Immigration Rules.  He  told
me that the appellant cannot satisfy either the requirements of Appendix  FM
or those of Appendix FM-SE because there are  fundamental  failings  in  the
documents produced by the appellant.

18.   In order to succeed under Appendix FM, the appellant would have to  be
eligible for entry clearance as an adult dependent relative. It  is  Section
E-ECDR of Appendix FM which governs such  applications.  E-ECDR2.4  requires
that the appellant "...as  a  result  of  age,  illness  or  disability  (2)
require long term personal care to perform everyday tasks".

19. Mr Ahmed was asked specifically about the limitations  of  his  mother's
ability and he stated, in clear and unambiguous terms, that his  mother  can
wash and dress himself, and can mobilise around a  two  storey  house;  that
she can walk short distances outdoors and that she can pursue  the  ordinary
activities of daily living. There is  no  reliable  evidence  before  me  to
indicate that the appellant requires "...long term personal care to  perform
everyday tasks". There is, in fact, reliable evidence before me to  indicate
that the appellant does  not  require  personal  care  to  perform  everyday
tasks.

20. E-ECDR2.5 (of appendix FM) requires an examination of  the  availability
of the required level of care in Pakistan. The problem for the appellant  is
that there is a dearth of evidence of the  available  support  and  care  in
Pakistan.

21. Taken at its highest, the evidence  pled  on  behalf  of  the  appellant
amounts to a statement of a fear that there is no one who can be trusted  in
Pakistan. There is no support for those assertions and I find that I  cannot
place  reliance  on  those  assertions.  The  appellant  cannot  fulfil  the
requirements of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.

22.   Because of the length of time that the appellant has been  in  the  UK
and because she entered as  a  visitor,  the  appellant  cannot  fulfil  the
requirements of Paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration Rules.



Human Rights

23    In R (on the application of Esther Ebun Oludoyi & Ors) v  SSHD(Article
8 - MM (Lebanon) and Nagre) IJR [2014] UKUT 00539  (IAC)  in  which  it  was
held that there is nothing in R (Nagre) v  SSHD  [2013]  EWHC  720  (Admin),
Gulshan (Article 8 - new Rules - correct approach) Pakistan [2013] UKUT  640
(IAC) or Shahzad (Art 8:  legitimate  aim)  [2014]  UKUT  00085  (IAC)  that
suggests that a threshold test was being suggested as opposed to  making  it
clear that there was a need to look at the evidence  to  see  if  there  was
anything which has not already been adequately considered in the context  of
the Immigration Rules and which could lead to a successful Article 8  claim.
These authorities must not be read as  seeking  to  qualify  or  fetter  the
assessment of Article 8. This is  consistent  with  para  128  of  R  (MM  &
Others) v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 985, that there is no utility in  imposing  a
further intermediate test as a preliminary to a consideration of an  Article
8  claim  beyond  the  relevant  criterion-based  Rule.  As  is  held  in  R
(Ganesabalan) v SSHD [2014] EWHC 2712 (Admin), there is no  prior  threshold
which dictates whether the exercise  of  discretion  should  be  considered;
rather the nature of the assessment and the reasoning which are  called  for
are informed by threshold considerations.
24    In SS(Congo) and Others [2015] EWCA Civ 387 Richards LJ  Lord  Justice
Richards said at paragraph 33 "In  our  judgment,  even  though  a  test  of
exceptionality does not apply in every case  falling  within  the  scope  of
Appendix FM, it is accurate to say that the  general  position  outside  the
sorts  of  special  contexts  referred   to   above   is   that   compelling
circumstances would need to be identified to support a claim  for  grant  of
LTR outside  the  new  Rules  in  Appendix  FM.  In  our  view,  that  is  a
formulation which is not  as  strict  as  a  test  of  exceptionality  or  a
requirement of "very compelling reasons" (as referred to in MF (Nigeria)  in
the context of the Rules applicable to foreign criminals), but  which  gives
appropriate weight to the focused consideration of public  interest  factors
as finds expression in the Secretary  of  State's  formulation  of  the  new
Rules in Appendix FM. It also reflects the formulation  in  Nagre  at  para.
[29], which has been tested and has survived scrutiny in  this  court:  see,
e.g., Haleemudeen at [44], per Beatson LJ".
25. In SS(Congo)  and  Others  [2015]  EWCA  Civ  387  Richards  LJ  drew  a
distinction in entry clearance cases, on the  one  hand,  involving  someone
outside the United Kingdom who applies to come here to  take  up  or  resume
family life when family life was  originally  established  in  ordinary  and
legitimate circumstances at some time  in  the  past,  rather  than  in  the
knowledge of its precariousness  in  terms  of  United  Kingdom  immigration
controls and cases, on the other, where  someone  from  the  United  Kingdom
marries a foreign national or establishes a  family  life  with  them  at  a
stage when they are contemplating trying to  live  together  in  the  United
Kingdom, but when they know that their partner does  not  have  a  right  to
come here. In the latter cases,  the  relationship  will  have  been  formed
under conditions of known precariousness  and  it  will  be  appropriate  to
apply a similar test of exceptional  circumstances  before  a  violation  of
Article 8 will be found to arise in relation to a refusal to grant Leave  to
Remain outside the Rules.
26    Section 117 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002  is  a
factor  to  be  taken  into  account  in  determining   proportionality.   I
appreciate that as the public  interest  provisions  are  now  contained  in
primary  legislation  they  override  existing  case  law,  Section  117A(2)
requires me to have regard to the considerations  listed  in  Sections  117B
and 117C.  I am conscious of my statutory duty to take  these  factors  into
account when coming to  my  conclusions.   I  am  also  aware  that  Section
117A(3) imposes upon me the duty of carrying out a  balancing  exercise.  In
so doing I remind myself of the guidance contained within Razgar.

27    In  Kugathas v SSHD (2003) INLR 170 the Court of Appeal said that,  in
order to establish family life, it is necessary to  show  that  there  is  a
real committed or effective  support  or  relationship  between  the  family
members and the normal emotional ties between a  mother  and  an  adult  son
would not, without more, be enough.

28. There are clearly the normal emotional ties between  the  appellant  and
sponsor. In the application, the sponsor expresses his desire to look  after
his mother, but when I take an holistic view of  each  strand  of  evidence,
there is an absence of evidence of anything more than just  emotional  ties.
There is no evidence  of  financial  dependency.  The  appellant  has  funds
invested in Pakistan which are available to her, and which provide her  with
an income. The argument in this case proceeds on the question of  dependency
for personal care, but my findings of fact indicate that  the  appellant  is
able to pursue the ordinary activities of daily living independently.

29. In the absence of evidence of anything more than  the  normal  emotional
ties between the appellant and the sponsor, I find that family  life  within
the meaning of article 8 ECHR does not exist between  the  sponsor  and  the
appellant.

30. Mr Jarvis conceded that family life exists  between  the  appellant  and
her grandchildren, with whom she has been living since  February  2014.  The
respondent's decision, if implemented, would  separate  the  appellant  from
her grandchildren. They would no longer live under the same roof.

31    The effect of the respondent's decision would be  that  the  appellant
would have to return to Pakistan. She would return to Pakistan  without  the
support of other family members and might have to live alone. The weight  of
evidence produced indicates that healthcare facilities are available to  the
appellant. The evidence produced indicates that the  appellant  has  savings
and an independent income.

32. No reliable  evidence  of  the  impact  of  the  appellant's  return  to
Pakistan on her grandchildren is placed before me.  I  have  no  doubt  that
there is significant affection between the appellant and  her  grandchildren
- but that relationship is a relationship which  had  been  pursued  from  a
distance until February 2014. On the sponsor's  evidence,  it  was  intended
that the appellant would return to Pakistan and it was only one month  after
she arrived in the UK that it was discovered that the son with whom she  had
lived had left Pakistan for Saudi Arabia, and the home that  she  had  lived
in had been rented out to others.

33. Taking the evidence at its highest, it is the appellant's son's  removal
to Saudi Arabia which has caused this family to rethink their  future  plans
for the appellant. None of those considerations point to such a strong  bond
between the appellant and her grandchildren that  the  previous  arrangement
of contact through visits and electronic communication  should  not  be  re-
established.

34     There  is  a  lack  of  evidence  of  the  appellant's   own   health
difficulties. The only medical evidence placed before me comes from the  Aga
Khan University Hospital, Karachi, and appears to relate to  negative  blood
tests for hepatitis and HIV. There is a  lack  of  evidence  of  significant
disability. Indeed, the oral evidence is that the appellant can  pursue  the
ordinary activities of daily living independently.

35    The harsh truth is that if the  appellant  returns  to  Pakistan,  she
will return to the country where she has  pursued  practically  all  of  her
life. She will return to the routines that she  had  established  throughout
her life, until February 2014. She will have to find accommodation  but  she
has the wherewithal to find accommodation. Healthcare is  available  to  the
appellant in Pakistan and return to Pakistan will not deprive the  appellant
of contact to her children and grandchildren.

36. I consider s. 117B of the  2002  Act.  The  maintenance  of  immigration
control is in the public interest. Only s.117B (2) &  (3)  are  relevant  to
this appeal. My findings of fact indicate that the appellant is  financially
independent. I have no reliable evidence of the appellant's ability  in  the
English language. In the circumstances of this  case,  I  cannot  find  that
consideration of s.117B of the 2002 Act is determinative of this appeal.

37. No argument is advanced in relation to private life, but, on  the  facts
as I find them to be, the appellant has not established private life  within
the meaning of article 8 ECHR in the UK.

38. I therefore conclude that there are no reasons  to  consider  this  case
outside the Immigration  Rules  and  that  the  SSHD's  decision  is  not  a
disproportionate breach of the Article 8 rights  of  the  Appellant  or  the
Appellant's grandchildren.

Decision

I dismiss the appeal under Article 8 ECHR.

I dismiss the appeal under the Immigration Rules
