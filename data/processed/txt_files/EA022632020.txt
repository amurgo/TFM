                                  DECISION

BACKGROUND

1.           The  Appellant  appeals  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
      Tribunal  Judge  Plumptree  promulgated  on  23  February  2021  ("the
      Decision") dismissing the Appellant's appeal against the  Respondent's
      decision dated 2 October 2019 refusing the Appellant a  family  permit
      to join his brother ("the  Sponsor")  in  the  UK.   The  Respondent's
      decision is made pursuant to the European  Economic  Area  Regulations
      2016 ("the EEA Regulations").  As a transitional case, the  appeal  is
      unaffected by the United Kingdom's departure from the European  Union.
      I was informed by the Appellant's Counsel  that  the  Sponsor  remains
      living in the UK and has permission to do so under the  EU  Settlement
      Scheme.


2.          The Appellant is a national  of  Pakistan.   The  Sponsor  is  a
      Spanish national.  The Appellant claims to be  entitled  to  a  family
      permit on the basis that he is now and has been in the past  dependent
      on the Sponsor. He therefore claims to satisfy the definition  in  the
      EEA Regulations of an extended family member.

3.          Judge Plumptre accepted that the Appellant had shown  dependency
      after 2016 but not that he had done so at any earlier date.   She  did
      not accept that the funds sent by the Sponsor were for the Appellant's
      sole use.  She dismissed the appeal for those reasons.

4.          The Appellant appeals on  four  grounds.   Those  are  that  the
      Judge has  materially  misdirected  herself  in  law,  has  reached  a
      perverse conclusion and has taken into account immaterial matters.

5.          Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge  Martin
      as a First-tier Tribunal Judge on 9 April 2021 in the following terms:

            "..2.      It is  arguable  that,  the  Judge  having  found  at
           paragraph 12 of  the  Decision  and  Reasons  that  the  sponsor
           financially supported his parents household, which included  the
           appellant, that ought to have been determinative of  the  appeal
           in the appellant's favour."

6.          Although the Respondent filed and served a Rule 24  reply  dated
      6 May 2021, seeking to uphold the Decision, Mr Walker indicated at the
      outset of the hearing that he no  longer  resisted  the  appeal.   The
      Respondent was content that there was an error of law in the  Decision
      disclosed by the grounds, and that the Decision should be  set  aside.
      Mr Walker confirmed that, based on the findings made by Judge Plumptre
      (to which I come below), the Appellant's appeal should be  allowed  as
      those findings were sufficient to satisfy the EEA Regulations.

7.          I therefore indicated that I  found  an  error  of  law  in  the
      Decision, set it aside and re-made the  decision  in  the  Appellant's
      favour.  I indicated that I would provide my reasons in writing  which
      I now turn to do.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

8.           The  relevant  paragraphs  of  the  Decision  setting  out  the
      evidence before the Judge and her findings are at [9] and [11] to [16]
      of the Decision as follows:

            "9.  The sponsor stated that the  appellant  brother  has  never
           worked in Pakistan, does not have a bank account  and  lives  in
           the family home with his parents.  He said that no member of the
           household had any source of income. He confirmed that his father
           Mohammed Nawaz born 01 January 1994 [sic] and aged 77 years used
           to be a farmer but the farm had been  lost  due  to  erosion  in
           approximately 1999.  His mother Razia  Baigum  was  born  on  01
           January 1947 and is aged 74  years.   In  cross-examination  the
           sponsor confirmed that the family did own the farm  but  it  had
           been taken away/lost by erosion.  His brother had  never  worked
           on the farm.  His brother was educated up to the  equivalent  of
           GCSE standard.  The sponsor  confirmed  his  parents  owned  the
           family home and that they did not have  to  pay  rent  but  only
           utility bills.  The sponsor confirmed that he was  married  with
           his wife and child living in Pakistan who live with his  in-laws
           some 5-7 kilometres away.
                 ...
            11.  I find that the Presenting Officer rightly relied on  Dahoo
           v SSHD [2012] UKUT 70 which set out that a person can  establish
           that he is an extended family member in one  of  four  ways.   I
           find that the appellant has not established dependency prior  to
           2016.  Whilst I accept that the appellant  and  sponsor  brother
           lived in the same household from 1991-2000 when the sponsor left
           Pakistan to work in Spain, I find that there is no  evidence  to
           establish the appellant's dependency  on  his  brother  for  the
           first nine years of his life as he states in paragraph 5 of  his
           witness statement.  I note that  the  appellant  says  that  his
           brother has been providing him with financial support since  his
           arrival in Spain 2000 but give weight to the fact that there  is
           no evidence other than oral that he did so  and  no  documentary
           evidence of any remittances to Pakistan between 2000 and 2015.
            12.  I give weight to paragraph 7  of  the  appellant's  witness
           statement that the sponsor  brother  has  historically  provided
           funds to any of the household members who then give him cash.  I
           find that the evidence  shows  that  the  funds  transmitted  to
           Pakistan in recent years are consistent  with  maintaining  both
           the parents who are elderly and to some extent the appellant and
           in effect meets the living expenses of the family.
             13.   I  have  considered  Mr  Maqsood's  submission  that  the
           evidence about land erosion and the loss of the family  farm  is
           unchallenged and that at paragraph 9 of the appellant's  witness
           statement he sensibly acknowledges that some  of  the  transfers
           between 2017 and 2020 have included funds for  his  parents  and
           their living expenses as well as for himself.   However  I  give
           weight to the fact that there is no mention of the  family  farm
           being lost to erosion in the appellant's witness statement.
            14.  I find the schedule of living expenses at page  50  showing
           9,500 rupees on food,  3,500  rupees  on  utility  bills,  3,500
           rupees on medication, 700 rupees on phone bills, 2,000 rupees on
           transport and  2,100  rupees  on  other/miscellaneous  totalling
           21,300 rupees equating to ï¿½100 does not greatly assist me  since
           it is unclear which of these expenses  relate  to  the  parents'
           living expenses and which relate to the appellant.  I find  that
           these  are  household  expenses  rather  than  personal  to  the
           appellant brother.
            15.  I find as rightly submitted by the Presenting Officer  that
           the appellant has not  established  dependency  on  his  sponsor
           brother and that insufficient  evidence  was  provided  of  this
           particularly during the earlier years ie between 2000 and 2015.
            16.  It is to the credit of the sponsor that he sends  money  to
           his family in Pakistan given his  meagre  earnings  in  the  UK.
           However as stated earlier I find  that  the  evidence  of  funds
           transmitted can equally  be  for  the  support  of  his  elderly
           parents and not  necessarily  for  his  brother  and  find  that
           evidence of the appellant's brother's dependency on the  sponsor
           has not been established on the balance of probabilities."
                 [my emphasis]

9.          That passage and particularly the sections  emboldened  disclose
      the following errors:
            (a)  The Appellant needed to show past and  present  dependency,
      but he did not have to show that dependency had been continuous in the
      period since the  Sponsor  left  Pakistan.    It  was  sufficient  for
      dependency to be shown from 2016.
            (b)  The Appellant did not have to show that the funds  sent  by
      the Sponsor were  for  his  sole  use.   The  issue  was  whether  the
      Appellant was dependent on the Sponsor not whether their parents  were
      also dependent.
            (c)  It might have been open to  the  Judge  to  find  that  the
      Appellant was not dependent on the Sponsor if, for  example,  she  had
      found that the Appellant earned  income  from  the  farm  (having  not
      accepted that the family farm had been lost)  but  there  is  no  such
      finding.
            (d)  The Judge has failed to  consider  that  the  Appellant  is
      part of the same household as his parents  and  accordingly  the  fact
      that the evidence was of funds sent being used for household  expenses
      also disclosed a dependency of the Appellant.

10.         Having found  that  the  funds  sent  were  used  for  household
      expenses which included the expenses of the Appellant, that the  funds
      were used "to some extent" to support the Appellant and having  failed
      to identify any other source of income on which  the  Appellant  could
      rely, the Judge should have allowed the appeal.    The  Appellant  did
      not have to show that the funds were sent for his sole  use.   It  was
      enough that they were used to support the Appellant  as  well  as  his
      parents.

11.         For  those  reasons,  and  as  conceded  by  the  Respondent,  I
      conclude that the Decision contains an error of law and should be  set
      aside (whilst preserving the findings of fact made about the  evidence
      as those are not challenged).  As also conceded by the  Respondent,  I
      conclude   that   the   Appellant's   appeal   should   be    allowed.


DECISION
I am satisfied that the  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Plumptre
promulgated on 23 February 2021 discloses an error  of  law.   I  set  aside
that  decision  (whilst  preserving  the  findings  of  fact  made  on   the
evidence).  I re-make the  decision.   The  Appellant's  appeal  is  allowed
under the EEA Regulations.
