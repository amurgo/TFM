                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction and procedural history

    1. The appellant is a citizen of Afghanistan, a Pashtun, who  was  born
       on 3 August 1993. He is now 19 years old. The appellant  arrived  in
       the United Kingdom on 22 July 2009, avoiding immigration controls at
       about the time he reached his 16th birthday.  He was apprehended  by
       police. According to him, he had left Afghanistan  approximately  15
       months before his arrival, that is sometime in the spring  of  2008,
       when he would have been aged about 14�. He  said  he  had  travelled
       from Afghanistan overland. His  journey  was  authenticated  to  the
       extent that he had visited Greece and France en route where  he  had
       been fingerprinted.


    2. The appellant claimed asylum on being detained but  his  application
       was  refused  on  20  November  2009.  He  was,   however,   granted
       discretionary leave to remain as a minor until 3  February  2011  at
       which point he was 17�  years  old.  This  appears  to  signify  the
       respondent accepted the date of birth provided by him  of  3  August
       1993.

    3. He appealed the refusal of asylum but the respondent's decision  was
       upheld by First-tier Tribunal Judge Malone on 15 February 2010.


    4. During the period of extant leave, the appellant submitted a further
       application on 19 January 2011 which was refused on 28  April  2011.
       His appeal came before Judge Blair-Gould who dismissed  the  appeal.
       However, on 15 November 2011, Judge Holmes decided the Secretary  of
       State's  decision  was  not  in  accordance  with  the  law  because
       inadequate  steps  had  been  taken  to  consider  the   appellant's
       application as made by a minor, thereby requiring the  Secretary  of
       State to make a fresh and lawful decision which duly occurred  on  1
       February 2012.

    5. The fresh decision, made on 1 February 2012, was a refusal to  grant
       the appellant further leave and to issue directions for his  removal
       under s. 10 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999. The  appellant's
       appeal against this decision came before First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
       Oxlade whose determination was promulgated in April 2012 following a
       hearing which took place on 14 March 2012.

The error of law

    6. When the further appeal came before me in the Upper  Tribunal  on  4
       January 2013, I determined that the determination  of  Judge  Oxlade
       disclosed errors of law which required me to remake it.  I  gave  my
       reasons which form Appendix 1 to this determination.

The nature of the claim and the respondent's approach to it

    7. The appellant advanced his claim in a statement he made on 4  August
       2009.   In it he claimed that he was born in the village of  Shar-e-
       Now in Paktia Province.  His father was a shoe-maker and ran a  shop
       in the market whilst his mother worked in  the  offices  of  an  aid
       agency.  Indeed,  the  agency  occupied  premises   owned   by   the
       appellant's parents. Shortly after the agency took  occupation,  his
       parents received a 'night letter' in which  the  Taliban  threatened
       the family if his mother continued to work for what they  considered
       to be the Americans. Shortly afterwards, the  appellant's  own  home
       was razed to the ground by a deliberate arson attack and his  mother
       was killed in the  blaze.  Neighbours  assisted  him  to  travel  to
       Pakistan. Originally,  the  appellant  had  claimed  that  both  his
       parents had  died  and  that  he  was  assisted  in  Pakistan  by  a
       neighbour's uncle.

    8. In the course of the second statement made by  the  appellant  on  9
       February 2012, he spoke of his relatives. He identified  a  maternal
       uncle as well as to paternal uncles living in Pakistan with whom the
       family did not maintain good relations. He claimed he had no contact
       with them. As a result,  however,  of  assistance  provided  by  the
       International Red cross, the appellant contacted his maternal  uncle
       living in Afghanistan. The appellant claimed that his  uncle  wanted
       no more to do with him. There was,  however,  an  occasion  when  an
       attempt was made to speak to  him  by  telephone  organised  by  the
       appellant's solicitor at which the appellant himself was present but
       the uncle did not speak to him. The  event  was  the  subject  of  a
       witness statement by the interpreter who was present on 27 May 2011.
       It was he who dialled the number provided by the Red Cross  and  the
       person who answered confirmed he was N K and that the appellant  was
       his nephew. He said he had told the appellant  that  he  should  not
       call him in Afghanistan anymore and that he  had  his  own  problems
       with the  Taliban  who  had  threatened  him  as  a  result  of  his
       involvement in the construction industry. The uncle  confirmed  that
       he lived in Paktia. He showed reluctance to assist the appellant.


    9. The incident is confirmed by a message from the Red Cross  to  which
       the appellant's uncle replied:


             "I received your message to the Red Cross and became too happy
             for you. We did have your address to write your  messages  and
             we thank the Red Cross for transmitting your  RCM  (Red  Cross
             Message) to us. We will call you on the phone, as we  received
             your number. Here is my cell phone address.... thank  you  and
             the Red Cross for your address and phone number. Do not worry,
             your mother is passed away and  we  do  not  know  about  your
             father that where has he gone, he is missing.


   10. The appellant's representatives  have  also  been  involved  in  the
       gathering  of  information  about  the  aid  agency  for  whom   the
       appellant's mother worked. Contact was  made  with  Mr  Ahmadzai,  a
       Czech citizen who is employed by an organisation known as People  in
       Need (PIN). He had  worked  for  the  organisation  since  2004  and
       confirmed that the appellant's  mother  worked  for  him  in  Paktia
       province as a Female Social Organiser for  the  National  Solidarity
       Programme. He provided  details  from  the  organisation's  archives
       which showed she worked for PIN from  2005  to  2007  and  lived  in
       Sharre Nau (which the appellant's solicitor  had  transliterated  as
       Shar-e-Now).  Mr Ahmadzai did not know exactly what happened to  the
       appellant's mother but confirmed that, at the time, the organisation
       received night letters and that the  appellant's  house  was  burned
       down. The provincial manager told him that part of  the  family  had
       fled to neighbouring Pakistan and some were burnt in the house.


   11. The appellant's representatives provided a report dated  6  November
       2011 from Dr Antonio Giustozzi,  a  well-known  expert  witness  who
       spoke of the presence of  the  Taliban  and  other  Islamist  groups
       particularly in the Zazi (elsewhere transliterated  as  Zazai),  the
       tribal area where the appellant stated he came from. He spoke  of  a
       deteriorating security situation in 2010 with an  increasing  number
       of insurgent attacks in Paktia compared  with  the  same  period  in
       2009. There was a considerable intensification in the first  quarter
       of 2011. He spoke of the well-established record of the  Taliban  in
       pursuing local officials and NGO workers; in general, "everybody who
       maintains  relations  with  government  or  foreign  forces".   This
       material was clearly consistent with the appellant's account of  his
       parents being threatened and their home attacked.

   12. The report then went on to deal with the risk in Kabul province  and
       the southern districts of Kabul itself both  from  the  Taliban  and
       Hizb-e Islami.  The infiltration  of  the  Taliban  into  Kabul  has
       resulted in violent attacks in some areas of the city. There was  an
       escalating cycle of violence between 2008 and 2010 when  large-scale
       attacks were suspended in  exchange  for  political  concessions  in
       Kabul but the ceasefire broke down in  February  2011  and  targeted
       attacks took place against officials.  He  described  a  significant
       infiltration by insurgents in  a  number  of  southern  and  western
       districts of the capital, populated by Pashtuns.

   13. In addition, the appellant submitted a report from Mr  Ian  Shearer,
       the Sackler scholar, Middle  East  Department,  British  Museum.  Mr
       Sackler appears principally to be an archaeologist whose  particular
       specialty  is  the  preservation  and  protection  of  Afghanistan's
       cultural heritage. In pursuit  of  these  activities,  he  has  been
       involved in work in the National Museum in  Kabul.  However,  whilst
       working as an archaeologist in remote areas of Afghanistan,  he  has
       been involved with health care provision for local Afghans for  whom
       he has been trained to dispense medical aid. This has  led  directly
       to his involvement with Afghan children.

   14. In paragraphs 13 and 14 of his report,  he  spoke  of  the  violence
       meted out by the Taliban to those perceived to be traitors. This has
       involved instances against their family members. As a result of  the
       lack of central control by the Taliban leadership, the  fate  of  an
       individual or his family members would be at the whim of  the  local
       Taliban commander.  He considered that the risk of death  or  injury
       was very real. In particular,  Paktia  province  was  an  especially
       active base for  Taliban  operations  and  the  place  of  reprisals
       against Afghans perceived to be  working  against  their  interests.
       Those in large urban areas are not necessarily safe.

             Therefore the risk of harm to a family member of  a  perceived
             traitor from the Taliban is difficult to accurately  quantify:
             there is certainly a tangible risk to [the appellant] from the
             Taliban, as many other individuals - particularly young  males
             - related to perceived traitors have been killed.


       He described this as part of the broader strategic  campaign  by  the
       Taliban to undermine confidence in  the  Khazai  regime  but  it  was
       impossible to quantify the precise level of risk other than to define
       it as 'real, genuine and worrying'.

   15. In her letter of 20 November  2009,  setting  out  her  reasons  for
       refusing the appellant's application for asylum,  the  Secretary  of
       State recited the appellant's claim that his mother had  worked  for
       an international aid agency. At that time, the appellant  had  named
       the agency as 'TEN' rather than PIN.  Because the appellant had been
       unable to give adequate details about the nature of the work,  where
       it was based and the nationality of the organisation, the  Secretary
       of State rejected the appellant's  claim  that  his  mother  was  so
       involved. Inevitably, this resulted in the  wholesale  rejection  of
       this part of the claim. Accordingly,  the  respondent  rejected  the
       appellant's claim that the family was targeted, that the family home
       was destroyed and  his  parents  killed.  The  Secretary  of  State,
       therefore, approached her task on the basis that the  appellant  had
       parents in Afghanistan who were able to care for  him.  The  reasons
       are set out in paragraphs 17 to 21  of  the  refusal  letter.  As  a
       result of the material before me which I  have  set  out  above,  Ms
       Hursley on behalf of the respondent, no longer sought to  rely  upon
       these findings.


   16. Importantly, however, the respondent made  alternative  findings  on
       the assumption that the appellant's case were true. The Secretary of
       State considered there was a viable internal relocation  alternative
       in Kabul where he could be protected by his maternal uncle  who  had
       already taken responsibility for his care. Having considered country
       guidance on dealing with the risk of those seeking a  safe-haven  in
       Kabul, she concluded the appellant could safely return  there.  This
       examination of the appellant's case did not, of course, reflect  the
       fact that the appellant was a minor. Whilst the appellant's claim to
       be an orphan was expressly rejected,  his  age  was  not  apparently
       challenged.

   17. This error resulted in a  further  refusal  decision  in  which  the
       respondent's reasoning is found in the letter of 1 February 2012. By
       that time, the appellant was no longer a minor and was just over  18
       years of age. The Secretary of State repeated her position that  the
       appellant's mother did not work for an aid agency,  the  family  was
       not targeted and the appellant was of no particular interest to  the
       Taliban or at risk on return to his home.  The  respondent  repeated
       the assertion that the appellant had parents in Afghanistan able  to
       care for him. Once again, however, a viable  alternative  relocation
       option was raised.

The error in the respondent's approach to the claim

   18. It follows from this summary that the appellant's  claim  has  never
       been considered by the Secretary of State  on  the  basis  that  the
       appellant is a witness of truth in relation to the core  element  of
       his  claim.  Whilst  in  purely  rational  terms,  the  prospect  of
       relocation  to  Kabul  should  be  the  same  whether  or  not   the
       appellant's claim to be at risk of persecution in his home  area  is
       accepted or rejected, there is a  possibility  of  a  decision-maker
       being influenced by a prior adverse credibility finding; it  is  one
       thing for a decision-maker to consider relocation as a  hypothetical
       option on the basis of a finding that the applicant has consistently
       lied  about  his  history;  quite  another,  if  the  applicant  has
       truthfully spoken of his family being targeted by the Taliban  as  a
       result of his mother's involvement with an international aid  agency
       which ultimately led to her death.


Judge Oxlade's fresh approach and findings

   19. Judge Oxlade approached the appeal on the basis that he  could  rely
       on none of the findings relied upon  in  the  previous  appeals.  He
       considered that the documentary available to him in respect  of  the
       appellant's mother's work, the burning of the house  and  her  death
       went to the core of his claim and influenced views on the  appellant
       general credibility which resulted, at least in part, in the  appeal
       being dismissed. On the material which  I  have  recited  above,  he
       found the appellant's home had indeed been targeted as a  result  of
       her or his mother's work. I agree with that approach.

   20. He did not, however, accept that the appellant's father had died  or
       that the appellant did not know where he was living. In paragraph 43
       of his determination, he reached the sustainable  finding  that  the
       appellant's failure to attempt to trace his father on receipt of the
       information from the International Red Cross about from  his  uncle,
       established that he knew his  whereabouts.  This  also  explained  a
       period of time that was lost in his account between the death of his
       mother in 2007 and has setting out for the United Kingdom  in  2008.
       He found as a fact that the appellant and his  father  had  spent  a
       period of time together in Pakistan. Thus,  he  concluded  that  the
       appellant was aware that his father was alive and  that  he  was  in
       Pakistan and that the appellant left him in order to travel  to  the
       United Kingdom.  Once again, this is a sustainable finding of fact.

   21. The findings of  Judge  Oxlade  impacted  upon  the  effect  of  the
       Secretary of State's duty to trace the parents of a minor. Given the
       finding that the appellant knew of his father's whereabouts, but the
       appellant had not been  frank  about  that  information,  the  Judge
       concluded that the Secretary of State could not reasonably have done
       more. The maternal uncle had expressly indicated that he  no  longer
       wished to be involved in  which  case  tracing  would  have  had  no
       positive effect. The Judge found the failure of  the  respondent  in
       her duty to trace was not, therefore, material omission in the sense
       that it would have had no effect.

   22. In relation to relocation in Kabul,  Judge  Oxlade  found  that  the
       Taliban would not proactively seek out  the  appellant,  in  effect,
       reaching the sustainable finding of  fact  that  there  were  other,
       richer  pickings  for  the  insurgents  in  Kabul  ('a  target  rich
       environment') with the result that  he  would  not  be  at  risk  of
       Article 3 ill-treatment.  The decision of Judge Oxlade, however; did
       not deal with the reasonableness  of  relocation,  in  other  words,
       whether it would be unduly harsh to do so.

   23. This, therefore, is the issue which remains outstanding  before  me.
       This requires an examination of conditions in Kabul.

The reasonableness of relocation - Dr Antonio Giustozzi's evidence

   24. The evidence submitted by the appellant includes that found  in  the
       report of Dr Giustozzi.  In paragraph 9, he described how  both  the
       Taliban and Hizb-e Islami are trying to penetrate Kabul province and
       since 2006 have infiltrated the southern districts of Kabul province
       itself.  During 2008 the Taliban intensified military attacks in the
       Kabul  area.   The   influence   of   the   Taliban   underwent   an
       intensification  at  Kabul  University  and  other   colleges.   The
       escalation of attacks upon Kabul continued until the spring of  2010
       at which point a ceasefire was brokered  but  which  broke  down  in
       February 2011.  There are, of course, incidents  of  assassinations,
       including  the  police  intelligence  director  for  western  Kabul,
       Mohammed Gul (July 2010) and a policeman  in  the  centre  of  Kabul
       (January 2011). This is part of a more generalised targeted campaign
       against officials and members of the security forces. The  level  of
       violence is increasing. In 2010, civilian deaths  were  recorded  at
       2,777.

   25. Dr Giustozzi spoke of prospective landlords  and  employers  seeking
       information about an  individual's  origins  and  family  background
       thereby effectively depriving him of anonymity,  eventually  feeding
       back to those interested to know a person's whereabouts:

         Whether or not the connection to his mother and her NGO  employment
         would be obvious is difficult to say;  certainly  the  villages  in
         Paktia  will  know  the  family  but  in  Kabul  the  Taliban   not
         proactively seek [the appellant]  because  he  is  a  low  priority
         target in the target rich environment of the capital. The main risk
         to [the appellant] would be of a chance encounter with the  Taliban
         who might then enquire  about  his  background.  He  would  in  all
         likelihood settle in one of the Pashtun-populated neighbourhoods of
         southern and eastern Kabul, which are also the ones infiltrated  by
         the Taliban.


   26. Dr Giustozzi continued by dealing with the situation in Kabul:


         21. Finding accommodation will be difficult and expensive.  Due  to
         the massive return of refugees from  Pakistan,  which  led  to  the
         population of Kabul doubling in 12 months, and to  the  destruction
         of 65,00 - 70,000 houses caused by the war, rents shot up in  2002-
         2004. Four- to six-fold increases are reported to have taken  place
         over the last 18 months. It takes a manual labourer's wage  to  pay
         for the rent of a room, but it can often take more. Even in  remote
         parts of Kabul, two-room apartment cost in May 2013 US$120, up from
         US$20, 18 months earlier, that is 2 � times the salary of  a  civil
         servant.  By May 2007 rents had moved even higher, as the  building
         industry failed to meet demand and the average monthly rent of  two
         room apartment reached around US$200. After that  prices  continued
         to grow. At the same time the price of rents continued to  grow:  a
         room in a modest neighbourhood of  Kabul  cost  in  April  US$55  a
         month. A four-bedroom house in a more  affluent  neighbourhood  can
         cost US$10,000 a month to rent.  As of early 2011, even in the most
         remote and inaccessible parts of Kabul (up the mountain sides), the
         average family house was rented for US$220-330  a  month,  with  no
         running water or electricity  provided.  According  to  the  Afghan
         Ministry of Housing, the number of houses  is  urgently  needed  is
         180% more than those currently existing. On average, Kabul's houses
         and flats accommodate more than three times as many people as  they
         were built to, according to the Ministry of Housing.   The  typical
         low income household would cope by sharing one or two rooms  around
         7-12, an option clearly not available to [the appellant].


         22. Earning a livelihood on its own would  be  a  major  challenge,
         particularly if [the appellant] will not be able to rely in  family
         relations. Unskilled work as  a  daily  labourer  in  the  building
         industry is the most widely available option, but  due  to  massive
         unemployment (35-50% depending on the estimates) most workers  only
         get a few days of work each week. Daily labour rates in  Kabul  are
         about US$4 a day, but of course work is not always available. EUPOL
         estimates that a man with a family needs US$600 to live in Kabul, a
         single man would need  a  fraction  of  that,  probably  US$200  to
         least... [the appellant] could earn a good livelihood working as an
         interpreter, however this would represent a new source of  risk  as
         interpreters are a category targeted by the Taliban.

Mr Ian Shearer's evidence

   27. Mr Shearer's report spoke of the upsurge in attacks upon targets  by
       the Taliban in Kabul and elsewhere and the difficulties of obtaining
       protection from the police. In paragraph 32 in his report, he  takes
       up the point made by  Dr  Giustozzi  that  familial  and  clan-based
       support is paramount  to  an  Afghan's  survival  outside  his  home
       region.


         The social safety net for young adults without familial support  in
         Kabul and other urban  centres  is  limited  at  best.   By  Afghan
         standards [the appellant] is  well  into  adulthood  and  would  be
         expected to support both himself and any  extended  family  members
         still alive.  Yet [the appellant's] experiences  of  the  last  few
         years have left him without the webs of support and protection most
         Afghans  require  to  make  a  living,  and  in  my  personal   and
         professional experience, [the appellant] is  highly  vulnerable  to
         economic exploitation at best, and at risk from arbitrary arrest by
         the Afghan authorities, homelessness,  unemployment  and  blackmail
         utilising corrupt Afghan authorities as their mechanism to do so.

   28. Mr Shearer continues by saying that the Taliban pose a risk to those
       who are otherwise without  means  to  support  themselves  of  being
       recruited to their.

   29. He described the risk by reference to the nature of Kabul :

         Despite the substantial size of Kabul's ever increasing population,
         the Afghan capital is in many ways  actually  a  conglomeration  of
         rural villages masquerading as a neighbourhood and like many small,
         rural communities, the truth about an Afghan identity can  be  very
         hard to keep. The many difficulties that [the appellant] would face
         on his return from Afghanistan would be exacerbated in my  personal
         and  professional  experience  of  Afghanistan  by   the   absolute
         disconnect between his  age  and  experience  in  the  UK  and  the
         expectations that would be placed upon him in his home country:  he
         is a teenager in  the  United  Kingdom  and  considered  a  man  in
         Afghanistan with enormous attendant pressures and  responsibilities
         on him to feed, clothe and house himself,  as  well  as  take  full
         economic responsibility for any surviving family members.

My analysis of this material and approach to the re-making of the decision

   30. The difficulty I find in accepting this pessimistic outlook  on  the
       appellant's chances is  that  the  appellant  has  shown  himself  a
       resourceful and effective young man for a number  of  years  in  the
       United Kingdom and will not be returning as an  ing�nue.   There  is
       simply no question of his being burdened with the responsibility  of
       taking on the support of his family members either in Afghanistan or
       in Pakistan.  Dr Guistozzi appears to accept that he is  capable  of
       acting as a translator.  Whether or not he chooses  to  pursue  that
       course is a matter for the appellant but it demonstrates a level  of
       ability that is far beyond the level of a baker  or  a  construction
       worker, two of the  categories  identified  as  comparators  in  the
       reports.


   31. I have a further difficulty in accepting the evidence from the uncle
       at face value in that it is more likely  than  not  that  the  uncle
       would prefer his nephew  to  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  where
       conditions are likely to be more favourable to him than in Kabul  in
       terms of further  education,  job  prospects,  health-care  and  the
       safety-net of benefits available for maintenance  and  accommodation
       in the event that circumstances become tough.  If the appellant were
       living with his father in Pakistan for a year or so, it is  probable
       that he was in no immediate danger there and that  the  decision  to
       travel to the United Kingdom was not prompted by an  immediate  fear
       of serious harm.  In these circumstances, it is not likely that  the
       appellant's uncle would readily wish that the appellant's  plans  be
       thwarted by a return to Afghanistan.  Furthermore, there is a marked
       difference in the uncle's attitude as  displayed  in  the  telephone
       call compared with  the  response  to  the  Red  Cross  set  out  in
       paragraph 9 above.

   32. I do not, however, go so far as to  say  that  the  appellant  could
       safely return to the uncle's home in Paktia given the evidence about
       circumstances there.  Nor am I prepared to  accept  that  the  uncle
       should be expected to re-locate to Kabul  to  form  a  household  in
       Kabul with the appellant.  But nor do I think it  is  necessary  for
       him to do so.

   33. I reject, however, the uncle's claim that he would entirely wash his
       hands of the appellant if he were to be put in a position of serious
       need.  The ties of blood and family are strong and probably as  much
       so in Afghanistan where a person in need cannot look  to  the  state
       for financial assistance.   This appellant as a young man seeking to
       make his way in Kabul is likely to be in the same position  as  many
       thousands of others who have moved to the cities, both for  security
       and financial reasons just as the United  Kingdom  itself  has  seen
       urbanisation in past centuries as the relative draw  of  urban  life
       has won over from rural, village life.  It is true  that  this  puts
       pressures on housing and jobs in urban areas  as  we  have  seen  in
       Afghanistan, and in Kabul in particular, but I would not regard this
       as evidence that this migration is unreasonable or that life in  the
       towns is unduly harsh.

   34. Whilst it is tempting to say that such migration would not occur  if
       the relative advantages of relocating to Kabul did not outweigh  the
       disadvantages, a report from Amnesty International (to which I shall
       return later) voices a proper degree of caution about treating  such
       people as economic migrants and no more:


         "economic  migrants"  ignores  the  reality  that  those  who   are
         displaced have not moved out of choice. Most have fled after  their
         homes or villages were razed, after they  or  family  members  were
         killed or injured in fighting, after their children were unable  to
         attend school safely or were singled out for recruitment into armed
         groups, after they received threats or were compelled to hand  over
         money or property to armed groups, or for other reasons related to,
         or aggravated by, the conflict.

   35. The circumstances of the appellant's father  in  Pakistan  are  even
       less well developed in the evidence than those of the uncle and this
       is largely the responsibility of  the  appellant  who  has  revealed
       little about them.  I hesitate to speculate  abut  those  conditions
       but the fact that the appellant's father  remains  there  both  says
       something about the relative advantage in living there  rather  than
       in  Afghanistan  as  well  as  the  fact  that,  had  the   father's
       circumstances in Pakistan been abject, I am certain they would  have
       been developed in the evidence as a plank in the  appellant's  claim
       to be in need of surrogate protection.  Hence, avoiding speculation,
       I would not regard the appellant as being  unable  to  look  to  his
       father to some support if the need arose but  I  am  cautious  about
       placing an over-reliance on the extent of such help.

   36. Given the fact that there is no evidence that relations between  the
       appellant and his family members have broken down, it would be usual
       to expect other family members to do what they can in case of  need.
       It has, of course, been traditionally the family,  rather  than  the
       state, that has offered individuals a support mechanism.

   37. For these reasons, I approach the reasonableness of the  appellant's
       relocation to Kabul on the basis that he is not an orphan,  that  he
       has family members who cannot reasonably expected  to  join  him  in
       Kabul to offer the support of their presence but  who  will  do  all
       that is in their power to prevent the appellant from descending into
       destitution or penury.  The fact that the extent of  the  assistance
       his father is able to offer has not been established as a result  of
       the appellant's failure to adduce evidence about it in circumstances
       when he could, if he chose, have done so.  He returns as a young man
       in  good  health  who  had  acquired  independence  in  his   living
       arrangements and who has developed skills in the United Kingdom.

The COIS report

   38. The COIS report reissued  on  8  May  2013  provides  the  following
       information:


         1.08 Eurasianet, updated 1 February 2011 and  accessed  6  February
         2012, provided the following information about the housing shortage
         in Kabul:


         The lack of  affordable  housing  -  driven  by  a  rapidly  rising
         population  spurred  by  rural  to  urban  migration,  the  wartime
         destruction of neighborhoods, and an influx of well-heeled  foreign
         contractors occupying choice locations -  has  become  one  of  the
         biggest social problems in Kabul. Critics say not enough  is  being
         done  by  city  authorities  to  address  the  issue...Kabul  Mayor
         Muhammad Younus Nawandish highlights the population  issue.  'Kabul
         had a population of some 1.5 million in 2001, and now the number of
         its inhabitants exceeds 5 million,' he says, adding that  the  vast
         majority are unable to find housing in the capital. The  subsequent
         demand for rental homes and  flats  has  caused  rental  prices  to
         skyrocket, as have property prices. New homes have  cropped  up  in
         pockets where land prices are within reach, but they tend  to  lack
         formal urban planning, and critics says new housing  projects  tend
         to cater to the  more  wealthy...  a  three-room  apartment  in  an
         average area of Kabul that rented for about  $200  per  month  five
         years ago, now costs a minimum of [US] $500.


         'Middle-class Afghans' incomes, however, have not kept  pace.  With
         few exceptions, public-sector workers' wages range between $50  and
         $250 a month.'


         1.09 However, the Economist Intelligence Unit in their  Afghanistan
         report, dated January2012 and accessed 6 February 2012, stated:


         'In a further sign of economic weakness, house prices in Kabul have
         started to fall after years of inflated  house  prices  and  rents.
         Real  estate  agents  in  the  capital  have  complained  that  the
         announcement of the first phase of the transition  of  ISAF  forces
         marked the tipping point, with house prices dropping by 20-40% over
         the summer of 2011. Property dealers have also  expressed  concerns
         that Kabul is becoming increasingly segregated along ethnic  lines;
         in particular, Pashtuns are said to be congregating in areas of the
         city with easier access to the Pashtun-dominated east and south  of
         the country.'


         1.10 The International Organisation of Migration Country  Sheet  on
         Afghanistan, updated 13November 2009 and accessed 6 February  2012,
         further added,


         'Buses, donated to Afghanistan by India, Japan, Iran (around  600),
         all operate in  Kabul  at  the  moment.  A  typical  bus  fare  for
         transportation  within  the  city  is   around   AFA   5.   Private
         transportation companies also  exist.  Fares  are  higher  than  on
         public buses.'


         8.82 The US  Department  of  Defense  'Report  on  Progress  Toward
         Security and Stability in Afghanistan', dated April 2012, stated:


         During this reporting period [October 2011 to March 2012], security
         incidents  in  Regional  Command  -  Capital   were   statistically
         insignificant (less than one  percent)  compared  to  all  security
         incidents  throughout  Afghanistan,   and   thus   represented   no
         significant change compared to the same time period one  year  ago.
         RC-C [regional command Capital] is by far the smallest RC...  Kabul
         City had a relatively calm fall [2011] and winter [2011-2012].


         8.83 However, the International Institute  for  Strategic  Studies'
         Armed Conflict Database stated the following in a piece  describing
         the situation in March to April 2012:


         The  Taliban  mounted  coordinated   attacks   across   Kabul   and
         neighbouring provinces in April, which they said marked the  launch
         of  their  spring  offensive  against  NATO   troops.   Around   21
         insurgents,  including  suicide  bombers,   launched   simultaneous
         attacks on Nangarhar,  Paktika  and  Logar  provinces  as  well  as
         Kabul's diplomatic quarter. The siege lasted over 18  hours  before
         Afghan troops, charged with the security of Kabul, ended it with  a
         final gunfight at the Afghan  Parliament.  Afghan  President  Hamid
         Karzai called the attack a massive 'failure' on  the  part  of  the
         intelligence services,  especially  NATO.  He  said  Afghan  forces
         proved  themselves  capable  of  defending  the  country.   Western
         military officials admitted they were surprised by  the  scale  and
         sophistication of the synchronised attacks.'


         8.84 The Institute for War and Peace Reporting issued  this  report
         on 17 April 2012 regarding insurgent attacks on  15  and  16  April
         2012:


         'A number of key locations  in  the  capital  were  targeted,  with
         dozens of militants firing on the Afghan parliament,  the  national
         army academy and the Sherpur district, home  to  senior  government
         officials and diplomats. Foreign embassies also came under fire  in
         the onslaught, which began at noon on April 15 and was only brought
         to a halt the following  morning...  There  were  also  attacks  in
         Logar, Nangarhar and Paktia provinces. According  to  the  interior
         ministry, 47 people died, 36 of them the insurgents who carried out
         the attack. Three civilians and eight policemen were killed. Of the
         65 people injured, 25 were civilians.'


         8.85 The US Congressional Research  Service  report,  'Afghanistan:
         Post-Taliban Governance, Security and US Policy', dated 3 May 2012,
         stated that:


         '...observers note an apparent increase in major attacks  in  Kabul
         [city], which is generally considered secure:  on  June  28,  2011,
         insurgents stormed the historic Intercontinental  Hotel  in  Kabul,
         prompting a several hour gun battle with Afghan authorities  backed
         by NATO-led forces. On August 19,  2011,  insurgents  attacked  the
         compound of the British Council in Kabul,  on  the  anniversary  of
         Afghanistan's  formal  independence  from  Britain  in  1919.   The
         September 13, 2011, rocket and gunfire attack on the  U.S.  Embassy
         in Kabul and  ISAF  headquarters  prompted  even  more  significant
         questions about U.S.  and  Afghan  successes,  although  some  U.S.
         officials used the attack as an indication  that  insurgent  groups
         are altering their tactics in response to being largely defeated in
         their strongholds in eastern and southern Afghanistan...  On  April
         15,  2012,  about  35  insurgents  attacked  several  locations  in
         downtown Kabul, as  well  as  conducted  attacks  in  a  few  other
         provinces.'


         8.86 The Danish Immigration Service report  on  their  fact-finding
         mission to Kabul  in  February/March  2012,  entitled  'Country  of
         Origin Information for use in the  asylum  determination  process,'
         and dated May 2012, stated:


         'Regarding the security situation in Kabul,  IOM  said  that  there
         have been a number of suicide attacks which influences the lives of
         ordinary people. However, apart  from  suicide  attacks,  Kabul  is
         safer than other places in Afghanistan, and the area is more  under
         control. This is, according to IOM, due to  the  fact  that  Afghan
         National Army (ANA) and ANP in general are more trained in security
         operations in Kabul and other big cities like  Herat  and  Mazar-i-
         Sharif and the situation is more  under  control  in  these  cities
         compared to other parts of the country. In Jalalabad, however,  the
         authorities are not yet that  efficient,  and  the  Taliban  has  a
         strong influence.'




Amnesty International 'Fleeing  War,  Finding  Misery:  The  Plight  of  the
Internally Displaced in Afghanistan'

   39. The appellant's bundle includes a report from Amnesty  International
       'Fleeing War, Finding Misery: The Plight of the Internally Displaced
       in Afghanistan' (February 2012).  The report was concerned with  the
       fate of internally displaced persons (IDPs)  rather  than  returning
       failed asylum seekers.  It was based  on  research  gathered  during
       five fact-finding missions between November 2008 and June 2011, each
       three to five weeks in length, as  well  as  additional  information
       obtained  by  Amnesty   International   researchers   in   follow-up
       communications from London  between  July  2011  and  January  2012.
       During its field research, Amnesty International  conducted  private
       interviews with more  than  100  internally  displaced  persons  and
       returning refugees in 12  slum  communities  in  and  around  Herat,
       Kabul, and Mazar-e-Sharif.


   40. In Kabul, the researchers visited communities in  Bagh-e-Dawood,  in
       the Paghman District in the west of the city,  housing  140  to  150
       families and located on parcels of land variously owned  by  private
       individuals and the Ministry of  Defence;  Chaman-e-Babrak,  in  the
       north of the city, with 1,300 families and located on private  land;
       Charahi Qamber, in the west of the city, with 750 families,  located
       on land owned by the Ministry  of  Defence;  Ferqa  Shanza,  in  the
       Paghman District, with approximately 25 families and located on land
       owned by the Ministry of Defence; and Kart-e-Parwan,  where  several
       hundred families live on privately owned land.  These are relatively
       small numbers, as we shall later see.

   41. There is no doubt that life for these  persons  is  at  a  very  low
       level.  However, the circumstances of those interviewed  should  not
       be treated as the inevitable consequences of  all  those  returning.
       For the population of Afghanistan as a whole, the average  household
       size is between seven and eight individuals, and  one-fifth  of  all
       households in the country have 10 or more  people.2  The  households
       Amnesty International visited for its  report  were  usually  larger
       than the national average, often  with  10  to  15  extended  family
       members and sometimes as many as 30.  Hence, the 'profile' of  those
       in camps is different from that of the appellant.

   42. The report continues:


         Four hundred people a day are displaced in Afghanistan, on average,
         bringing the total displaced population to 500,000 by January 2012.


         Such  internal  displacement  is  on  the  rise.   Conflict-induced
         internal displacement increased rapidly in the first half of  2011-
         the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) estimates that nearly 100,000  people
         were internally displaced between January and June  of  that  year.
         The number of displaced persons has increased every year  since  at
         least 2008.


         Tens of  thousands  of  these  displaced  individuals  have  sought
         shelter in and  around  Kabul  and  other  Afghan  cities.  Precise
         numbers are difficult to determine, but as many as 35,000 displaced
         persons are now living in slum areas in Kabul alone. They  make  do
         as best they can, finding abandoned lots and constructing makeshift
         dwellings from mud, poles, plywood, plastic sheeting, and cardboard
         that offer them little protection from  the  elements.  Nearly  two
         dozen displaced children under the age of five froze  to  death  in
         January 2012.

   43. The report identified difficulties faced in access  to  water  as  a
       serious concern, and access to work without which many  families  do
       not get enough to eat and cannot afford health care.   The  families
       live under constant threat of forced eviction. Lack of basic hygiene
       means  that  illness  spreads  easily,  particularly  amongst  young
       children.

   44. This, however, should be seen in the context  of  the  much  broader
       picture of the effects of the conflict and the process by which  the
       country is seeing the return of many who fled.  Over  three  decades
       of fighting created a refugee population, which peaked at 6  million
       in the 1980s:

         Refugees started to return to Afghanistan in 1989-over one  million
         from Pakistan in a six-month period in 1992-and by 1997,  some  3.9
         million had returned. Another rise in displacement,  both  internal
         and international, began in 2001 and peaked in 2002. Refugees again
         began to return to Afghanistan in large numbers from 2002  to  2004
         and have continued on a much smaller  scale  in  subsequent  years.
         Nevertheless,   the   number   of   returning   refugees    dropped
         substantially in 2011, with 60,000 UNHCR-assisted  refugee  returns
         in the first 10 months of 2011 as compared with over 100,000 during
         the same period in 2010. The most frequently cited reasons for  not
         returning are lack of livelihood opportunities,  lack  of  shelter,
         and insecurity, UNHCR reported  in  October  2011.  Speaking  at  a
         distribution centre for returning refugees in December 2011,  Peter
         Nicolaus, UNHCR's representative  in  Afghanistan,  said  that  the
         failure to address the issue of livelihoods and consequent problems
         of reintegration "was the biggest mistake that UNHCR ever made" and
         that the agency was now concentrating on  sustainable  integration.
         "It's the income that counts, the livelihood. In very simple  terms
         we need to find jobs for the people coming back," he remarked.


   45. Nevertheless, in the last decade, UNHCR has assisted the  return  of
       over 4.6  million  refugees  to  Afghanistan.  Including  those  who
       returned without UNHCR assistance, between 5.5 million and 6 million
       refugees are estimated to have returned to Afghanistan between  2002
       and  2011.  As  a  recent  Security  Council  report   notes,   "The
       Afghanistan  return  operation  remains  the  single  largest   such
       operation for UNHCR." Some 1.7 million refugees remain in  Pakistan,
       and 1 million remain in Iran.

The Afghanistan Operational Guidance Note

   46. I was referred to the Afghanistan OGN v10, issued in  June  2012  so
       far as it relates to Returns:

         5.1 There is no policy  which  precludes  the  enforced  return  to
         Afghanistan of failed asylum seekers who have  no  legal  basis  of
         stay in the United Kingdom.


         5.3 The preferred  option  for  repatriating  those  Afghan  asylum
         applicants who having exhausted the independent appeal process, are
         found not to need international protection  is  assisted  voluntary
         return. This policy is in line with the  Tripartite  Memorandum  of
         Understanding on Voluntary Return, between the UK,  the  UNHCR  and
         the Afghan Transitional Administration. However, as agreed with the
         Afghan authorities, from April 2003 those  not  choosing  voluntary
         return and found to be without  protection  or  humanitarian  needs
         have been liable to be considered for enforcement  action  although
         those individuals or groups identified as vulnerable  are  excluded
         from the programme of  enforced  returns.  We  recognise  that  the
         Government of Afghanistan is still in the process of rebuilding the
         country and we do not wish to destabilise that process with a rapid
         influx of large numbers of people. All Afghans returning  from  the
         UK are offered access to a training and employment package and care
         is taken to return people gradually to those  areas  with  adequate
         security and infrastructure where we are satisfied they  will  have
         sufficient support.

H and B v the United Kingdom

   47. I was also referred to the decision on the ECtHR in H and  B  v  the
       United Kingdom - 70073/10 44539/11 - Chamber  Judgment  [2013]  ECHR
       298 (09 April 2013) which itself makes reference to  a  considerable
       amount of British  jurisprudence  such  as  GS  (Article  15  (c) :
       Indiscriminate violence) Afghanistan CG [2009] UKAIT 00044,  HK  and
       others (minors - indiscriminate violence  -  forced  recruitment  by
       Taliban - contact with family members) Afghanistan  CG  [2010]  UKUT
       378 (IAC), AA (unattended children) Afghanistan CG [2012] UKUT 00016
       (IAC), AK (Article 15(c)) Afghanistan CG [2012] UKUT 00163 (IAC)  PM
       and others (Kabul - Hizb-i-Islami) Afghanistan CG [2007] UKAIT 00089
       and RQ (Afghan National Army - Hizb-i-Islami - risk) Afghanistan  CG
       [2008] UKAIT 00013.  The first applicant in H and  B  v  the  United
       Kingdom argued amongst other things, that it would be  unduly  harsh
       for him to internally relocate to Kabul or elsewhere in  Afghanistan
       because of his poor mental health. He relied on a  letter  dated  28
       March 2011 from his GP which stated that he was  being  treated  for
       depression and had reported symptoms of sleep disturbance,  loss  of
       appetite, an inability to experience pleasure and low mood.  His  GP
       noted that the first applicant reported no suicidal planning, but he
       was concerned that there was a possibility of self-harm and  he  had
       therefore  referred  the  first  applicant  for  a   mental   health
       assessment. The  first  applicant  also  submitted  a  report  dated
       2 December 2011 by Dr Giustozzi, the author of  a  Landinfo  report
       also before the Court which  stated,  inter  alia,  that  the  first
       applicant could be relatively easily  tracked  down  in  Afghanistan
       because everybody would be aware of his father's past and  he  would
       be easily recognised.

   48. In considering whether the applicants  have  established  that  they
       would be at real risk of ill-treatment  in  Afghanistan,  the  Court
       observed that they had not claimed that the levels  of  violence  in
       Afghanistan are such that any removal there would necessarily breach
       Article 3 of the Convention.  The issue of the levels of violence in
       Afghanistan  has  been  thoroughly  examined  by  the   Asylum   and
       Immigration Tribunal and the Upper Tribunal in the series of country
       guidance cases I have  mentioned  above.  The  conclusion  that  the
       levels of violence was not such as to create a general risk of  ill-
       treatment to all persons returned to Afghanistan was  reached  on  a
       proper examination of  the  evidence  and  a  readiness  to  reflect
       changing conditions in a rapidly evolving situation.

   49. The ECtHR found no evidence  to  suggest  that  it  should  reach  a
       different conclusion, concluding that  there  is  not  currently  in
       Afghanistan a general situation of violence such that there would be
       a real risk of ill-treatment simply by virtue of an individual being
       returned there.

   50. Both applicants had concentrated on the risk of ill-treatment  which
       they alleged they would suffer at the hands of the Taliban owing  to
       their support of the international community. In  relation  to  the
       second applicant's claim that he would  be  unable  to  relocate  to
       Kabul because he would be destitute there, the Court  recalled  that
       humanitarian conditions in a country of return could give rise to  a
       breach of Article 3 of the Convention only  in  a  very  exceptional
       case  where  the   humanitarian   grounds   against   removal   were
       "compelling" (N. v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 26565/05, � 42,  27
       May  2008).  UNHCR  in  its  December  2010   Guidelines   generally
       considered  internal  relocation  reasonable  where  protection  was
       available from the individual's own extended  family,  community  or
       tribe in the area of intended relocation. Single males  and  nuclear
       family units may, in certain circumstances, subsist  without  family
       and community support in urban and semi-urban areas with established
       infrastructure and under effective Government control. Referring  to
       decisions made by  the  United  Kingdom  courts  that,  in  general,
       relocation to Kabul for young single males would not  be  unsafe  or
       unreasonable the ECtHR found that the second  applicant,  a  healthy
       single male of 24 years of age who spoke excellent English and  left
       Afghanistan in April 2011 when already  an  adult  (not  during  his
       formative years as argued by him), had failed to submit any evidence
       to the Court to suggest that his removal to  Kabul,  an  urban  area
       under  Government  control,  where  he  still  had  family   members
       including two sisters, would engage Article 3 of the Convention.

Overall conclusion on relocation in Kabul: H and  B  v  the  United  Kingdom
followed

   51. Dr Giustozzi described how both the Taliban and  Hizb-e  Islami  are
       trying to penetrate Kabul province and since 2006  have  infiltrated
       the southern districts of Kabul province itself  and,  during  2008,
       had intensified military attacks in the Kabul area.  Yet, as  recent
       events  show,  the  incidents  of  assassinations   appear   to   be
       principally  targeted  against   official   organisations   although
       civilian casualties are bound to occur in the cross-fire.  Elsewhere
       there was evidence of an  apparent  increase  in  major  attacks  in
       Kabul.  Dr Giustozzi described the main risk to the appellant as the
       result of a chance encounter with the Taliban in one of the Pashtun-
       populated  neighbourhoods  who  might   then   enquire   about   his
       background. He describes that finding accommodation is difficult and
       expensive largely  due  to  the  massive  return  of  refugees  from
       Pakistan.  I would not, however, accept that the appellant should be
       equated with a daily  labourer  performing  unskilled  work  in  the
       building industry.


   52. Ian Shearer's evidence describes the appellant as highly  vulnerable
       to economic exploitation at best, and at risk from arbitrary  arrest
       by the Afghan authorities, homelessness, unemployment and blackmail.
        But I would not regard the appellant as a  person  who  falls  into
       this category for the reason I have given.  Nor would I classify him
       as 'a man in  Afghanistan  with  enormous  attendant  pressures  and
       responsibilities on him to feed, clothe and house himself,  as  well
       as take  full  economic  responsibility  for  any  surviving  family
       members'.  Whilst I accept that he has  family  members  who  cannot
       reasonably expected to join him in Kabul to  offer  the  support  of
       their presence, I also consider that those family  members  will  do
       all in their power to prevent the  appellant  from  descending  into
       destitution or penury.  There is also evidence that house prices  in
       Kabul have started to fall after the years of inflated house  prices
       and rents.

   53. Nevertheless, there are  large  numbers  of  displaced  persons  now
       living in slum areas in and around Kabul although I would not regard
       the appellant as a person who obviously falls into  the  profile  of
       those there.  It has to be recalled  that  UNHCR  has  assisted  the
       return of over 4.6 million refugees to Afghanistan. Including  those
       who returned without UNHCR assistance, between  5.5  million  and  6
       million refugees are  estimated  to  have  returned  to  Afghanistan
       between 2002 and 2011.  The OGN speaks of assisted voluntary  return
       as a policy in line with the Tripartite Memorandum of  Understanding
       on Voluntary Return, between  the  UK,  the  UNHCR  and  the  Afghan
       Transitional Administration.

   54. H and B  v  the  United  Kingdom  supports  the  Tribunal's  earlier
       decisions that in general, relocation  to  Kabul  for  young  single
       males would not be unsafe or unreasonable.  In particular, the ECtHR
       found that the second applicant before it, a healthy single male  of
       24 years of age who spoke excellent English and left Afghanistan  in
       April 2011 when already  an  adult  failed  to  establish  that  his
       removal to Kabul was unlawful.


   55. Looking at this material in the  round  when  assessing  whether  it
       would be unduly harsh for the appellant to relocate to Kabul,  I  am
       satisfied that it would not.   I  readily  concede  that  there  are
       difficulties in finding accommodation or work but the  appellant  is
       better equipped than many to perform that task.  He  is  not  to  be
       treated as an orphan.   His position cannot be equated with the IDPs
       identified in  the  Amnesty  International  report.   The  level  of
       violence and the level of infiltration by the Taliban should not  be
       under-estimated but nor does the evidence suggest that it places  an
       individual in a position where  it  renders  his  relocation  unduly
       harsh or unreasonable.  Of  course,  these  considerations  are  set
       against the background of the sustainable finding of fact  that  the
       appellant is not at risk of persecution or serious harm but I  fully
       accept that 'serious harm'  and  'undue  harshness/unreasonableness'
       are different concepts and should remain distinct.

The tracing duty

   56. Mr Lewis repeated his submission that the respondent had a  duty  to
       trace the appellant's family in accordance with  the  dicta  of  the
       Court of Appeal in KA (Afghanistan) & Ors v  SSHD  [2012]  EWCA  Civ
       1014 (25 July 2012).  I had set out the principles  in  my  decision
       that Judge Oxlade had made  an  error  of  law.   For  the  sake  of
       continuity, I repeat them here.  The  duty  to  endeavour  to  trace
       arises from Council Directive 2003/9/EC  of  27  January  2003  (the
       Reception Directive), Article 19.3 of which provides:


             "Member States,  protecting  the  unaccompanied  minor's  best
             interests, shall endeavour to trace the members of his or  her
             family as soon as possible. In cases  where  there  may  be  a
             threat to the life or integrity of the minor  or  his  or  her
             close relatives, particularly if they  have  remained  in  the
             country of origin."

   57. The principle was  articulated  in  the  Asylum  Seekers  (Reception
       Conditions) Regulations 2005, regulation 6 of which provides:


             "(1) So as to protect an unaccompanied minor's best interests,
             the Secretary of State shall endeavour to trace the members of
             a minor's family as soon as possible after the minor makes his
             claim for asylum.

   58. This prompted Maurice Kay LJ to explore, in the case of a person who
       had  since  reached  his  legal  majority,  whether   the   historic
       illegality continued to be relevant:

             The Rashid/S line of authority


             14. The first question in the  present  case  is  whether  the
             Secretary of State failed to discharge the duty  to  endeavour
             to trace. Her case is  that  she  did  not  and  that  it  was
             discharged by, for example, informing the minor of the tracing
             facilities of the Red Cross. It will eventually  be  necessary
             to examine  each  of  the  cases  in  detail  but  I  have  no
             hesitation in saying that, if that was all that was  done,  it
             would not discharge the  duty  to  endeavour  to  trace.  This
             conclusion is supported by DS  (Afghanistan)  v  Secretary  of
             State for the Home Department [2011] EWCA Civ  305,  in  which
             Pill LJ said (at paragraphs 46-47):


                    "I readily acknowledge the difficulties which may  arise
                    on the making of enquiries  ...  In  the  present  case,
                    however, the Secretary of State did nothing  at  all  to
                    assist with tracing family members or to  enquire  about
                    reception arrangements on return and the court has  been
                    invited to uphold that inactivity  ...  What  should  be
                    done will vary from case to case.  Inactivity,  combined
                    with the failure  to  bring  to  the  attention  of  the
                    Tribunal the instruments cited  in  this  judgment,  was
                    not, in my view, a permissible option.
                    The Secretary of State seeks  to  defeat  the  claim  by
                    reason of the appellant's failure to cooperate with  the
                    Red  Cross.  Tracing  work  by  the  ICRC  would  almost
                    certainly have been assisted by a contribution from  the
                    Secretary of State, based on  information  available  to
                    her. The  lack  of  cooperation  does  not  relieve  the
                    Secretary of State of her duties ... the duty cannot  be
                    ignored."


             17. Having accepted that there was a systemic  breach  of  the
             duty to endeavour to trace, I now  have  to  consider  whether
             that may trigger the Rashid/S principle. It is  a  complicated
             question and not  simply  a  matter  of  the  systemic  breach
             entitling these appellants, without more ado, to the  allowing
             of their appeals with remittal to the Secretary  of  State  to
             consider grants of leave  to  remain,  which  is  the  primary
             relief sought. Nor does it admit of  the  simplistic  analysis
             that the appellants were over 18 when their cases came  before
             the FTT or the UT and, as a consequence and in accordance with
             the Ravichandran principle, the breach had  become  irrelevant
             to the requisite consideration of their cases by reference  to
             the circumstances prevailing at the time of the hearings. When
             the  Rashid/S  principle  applies,  it  modifies  the   strict
             application of Ravichandran.
             22. In HK it was submitted on behalf of the Secretary of State
             that the duty to endeavour to trace is quite distinct from the
             processing of an asylum application. Elias LJ (with whom  Pill
             and Rimer LJJ agreed) said (at paragraph 40)


                    "... the regulation 6 duty is in terms said to arise  as
                    soon as an  asylum  application  is  lodged  and  it  is
                    plainly intimately connected with the  determination  of
                    that  application.  This  suggests  that  it  should  be
                    treated as a necessary element in the  determination  of
                    an asylum application."


             However, he went on to conclude that failure to discharge  the
             duty to endeavour to trace does not lead  axiomatically  to  a
             successful outcome for the child's application on  appeal.  It
             is necessary for there to be a careful  consideration  of  the
             facts of each individual case.
             25...At the other end of the spectrum is  an  applicant  whose
             claim  to  have  no  surviving  family   in   Afghanistan   is
             disbelieved and in respect of whom it is  found  that  he  has
             been uncooperative so as to frustrate any attempt to trace his
             family. In such a case, again depending  on  the  totality  of
             established facts, he may have put himself beyond the bite  of
             the protective and corrective principle.
             26...Even in the context of a clear  breach  of  the  duty  to
             endeavour  to  trace,  a  tribunal  will  retain   a   certain
             robustness in assessing the evidence of a young person who has
             demonstrated a deep-rooted resistance to being returned to his
             country of origin.

The application of the principles

   59. As I have pointed out above in paragraphs 20 and  21,  Judge  Oxlade
       did not accept that the appellant's father  had  died  or  that  the
       appellant did not know where he was living. The appellant's  failure
       to attempt to trace his father on receipt of  the  information  from
       the International Red Cross about from his uncle,  established  that
       he knew his whereabouts. This also explained a period of  time  that
       was lost in his account between the death of his mother in 2007  and
       has setting out for the United Kingdom in 2008.  The  appellant  and
       his father had spent a period of  time  together  in  Pakistan.  The
       appellant was aware that his father was alive and  that  he  was  in
       Pakistan and that the appellant left him in order to travel  to  the
       United Kingdom.  These findings impact directly upon the  effect  of
       the Secretary of State's duty to trace the parents of a minor. Given
       the finding that the appellant knew of his father's whereabouts, but
       the appellant had not been frank about that information,  the  Judge
       concluded that the Secretary of State could not reasonably have done
       more. The maternal uncle had expressly indicated that he  no  longer
       wished to be involved in  which  case  tracing  would  have  had  no
       positive effect. The failure of the respondent in her duty to  trace
       was not, therefore, material omission in the  sense  that  it  would
       have had no effect.


   60. This was the provisional view that I expressed in ordering that  the
       decision required to be re-made and nothing that Mr Lewis  submitted
       to me addresses the issue.  Although in his submissions  to  me,  he
       repeated the fact that the appellant  has  never  been  offered  the
       opportunity of tracing, notwithstanding the fact that the respondent
       had a duty to do so, and it has  affected  the  outcome,  I  do  not
       agree.  The findings of  fact  made  by  the  Judge  are  clear  and
       sustainable.

   61. The attempts at tracing either the uncle or the father have drawn  a
       blank, albeit for different reasons.  The uncle has  been  contacted
       and has indicated a reluctance to  assist  when  approached  by  the
       appellant's representative.  He does not therefore need to be traced
       and it is  fanciful  to  suggest  that  the  outcome  would  be  any
       different if he were now approached by a United  Kingdom  government
       official, even if it were safe for that to  happen.   The  appellant
       has not been frank about the father's whereabouts but there has been
       a consistent account that he is, or was, in Pakistan.   Hence,  this
       has little bearing on a  return  to  Afghanistan.   Failure  in  the
       respondent's duty to trace is not a point-scoring exercise by  which
       an appellant wins leave to remain on the basis that the Secretary of
       State has breached a duty owed to him  and  the  'historical  wrong'
       should not be viewed in this way.  Rather, it is a piece of evidence
       that enters into the overall assessment and from which  a  decision-
       maker derives such  assistance  as  he  is  able.   The  duty  is  a
       collaborative exercise between government and asylum-seeker in which
       both parties have a part to play: the asylum-seeker because  he  can
       provide information that only  he  knows;  the  government  because,
       depending on the circumstances, it may have resources, influence  or
       men on the ground that the asylum-seeker cannot hope to  match.   If
       the collaboration works it might achieve the safe return of a  minor
       (or indeed an adult) and its failure may  therefore  be  a  material
       factor in assessing whether  a  person  should  be  removed.   Where
       however the evidence is that the government's failure to  trace  has
       had no material impact on the outcome, that the  appellant  has  not
       been prejudiced, that the public interest in removal  has  not  been
       significantly affected, there is nothing in the tracing  point.   If
       no consequences of  this  type  flow  from  it,  it  is  essentially
       immaterial.

   62. For these  reasons,  although  I  have  found  that  the  First-tier
       Tribunal Judge made an error of law, I conclude that  the  appellant
       has  failed  to  establish  that  it  would  be  unduly   harsh   or
       unreasonable for the appellant to relocate in  Kabul  and  that  the
       failure of the Secretary of State in her duty to endeavour to  trace
       the appellant's family during his minority do not  establish  he  is
       entitled to a grant of leave to remain.


DECISION

         The Judge made an error on a point of law and I substitute a
         determination dismissing the appeal on all the grounds advanced.

                                                 JUDGE OF THE UPPER TRIBUNAL
                                                                26 June 2013


                                 Appendix 1

                      FINDING ON ERROR ON POINT OF LAW


      1. In paragraph 47 of the determination of First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
         Oxlade, the Judge states:


             The Respondent argues that the  appellant  could  relocate  to
             Kabul. Dr  Giustozzi  speaks  of  the  Taliban's  attempts  to
             infiltrate Kabul, and in particular the  Pashto  areas,  where
             the appellant would naturally attempt to locate... Her opinion
             is that... in Kabul the Taliban would not actively pursue him,
             because he would be a low priority being in  such  a  "target-
             rich environment". His only risk in Kabul would be  by  chance
             encounter with the Taliban. Dr Shearer echoes this... In light
             of their reports, I find that the Taliban will not proactively
             seek out the appellant, who would be a low priority in  Kabul,
             living in a target rich environment. I find that the appellant
             is unlikely to  be  found  by  the  Taliban,  save  by  chance
             encounter. I find that this falls below the  standard  needed,
             that is being at real risk of persecution, serious harm, or  a
             breach of his Article 2 and 3 rights."


      2. The Judge reached a sustainable conclusion that the  appellant  was
         at risk in his home area because he faced  persecution  there,  see
         paragraph 46. It was also necessary for her to consider whether the
         appellant was at risk of persecution in another part of the country
         by reason of circumstances that might operate there.  That  is  the
         function of paragraph 47 (above).  The  Judge's  finding  that  the
         appellant would not be at real risk of persecution in  Kabul  is  a
         sustainable finding.


      3. However, the Judge overlooked the fact that the issue of relocation
         to Kabul also involved a consideration of  whether  it  was  unduly
         harsh or unreasonable for him to do so. This  was  a  separate  and
         discreet enquiry and, by its very nature, distinct from whether  he
         was at real risk of persecution there. Although the Judge  prefaced
         her comments in paragraph  47  by  referring  to  the  respondent's
         submission that the appellant could relocate to  Kabul,  the  Judge
         treated this as an assessment of  the  risk  the  appellant  faced,
         omitting to deal with the issue of whether it would be unreasonable
         for him to do so.   I have concluded that this amounts to  a  legal
         error.

      4. At the time the Judge heard  the  appeal  on  14  March  2012,  the
         appellant was already an adult although only some 18 �  years  old.
         She accepted that the family home had been  destroyed  by  fire  in
         which the appellant's  mother  had  died;  however,  he  found  the
         appellant had made no attempt to trace  his  father  and  that  the
         reason for this failure was because  he  knew  his  father  was  in
         Pakistan and that the appellant and his father had spent  a  period
         of time and which accounted for the delay between  2007  and  2008.
         The Judge also found that the appellant's evidence was designed  to
         conceal (the Judge used the word "diminish" in  paragraph  44)  the
         family members available to assist him on his return.

      5. In such circumstances an adult male, in good  health,  particularly
         one who has shown sufficient initiative to  travel  to  the  United
         Kingdom on his own and make a way for himself  here  is  likely  to
         encounter significant difficulties in his attempt to establish that
         it would be unduly harsh for him to settle in another part  of  the
         country of his nationality.  Mr Lewis, on behalf of the  appellant,
         however, submitted that there  were  such  difficulties  facing  an
         appellant in finding work in the capital where the cost  of  living
         has significantly risen over the last few  years,  along  with  the
         cost  of  accommodation  and  that   the   appellant   would   face
         destitution.

      6. This issue had been raised by Dr Guistozzi in paragraph 22  of  his
         report which was before the Judge.  This is an issue that  I  could
         not properly resolve in the time available to me.

      7. Furthermore, Mr Lewis maintained his submission that the respondent
         had a duty to trace the appellant's family in accordance  with  the
         dicta of the Court of Appeal in  KA  (Afghanistan)  &  Ors  v  SSHD
         [2012] EWCA Civ 1014 (25 July 2012).   The  duty  to  endeavour  to
         trace arises from Council Directive 2003/9/EC of  27  January  2003
         (the Reception Directive), Article 19.3 of which provides:


             "Member States,  protecting  the  unaccompanied  minor's  best
             interests, shall endeavour to trace the members of his or  her
             family as soon as possible. In cases  where  there  may  be  a
             threat to the life or integrity of the minor  or  his  or  her
             close relatives, particularly if they  have  remained  in  the
             country of origin."

         The principle was articulated  in  the  Asylum  Seekers  (Reception
         Conditions) Regulations 2005, regulation 6 of which provides:


             "(1) So as to protect an unaccompanied minor's best interests,
             the Secretary of State shall endeavour to trace the members of
             a minor's family as soon as possible after the minor makes his
             claim for asylum.

    This prompted Maurice Kay LJ to explore, in the case of  a  person  who
    had since reached his legal majority, whether the  historic  illegality
    continued to be relevant:

             The Rashid/S line of authority


             14. The first question in the  present  case  is  whether  the
             Secretary of State failed to discharge the duty  to  endeavour
             to trace. Her case is  that  she  did  not  and  that  it  was
             discharged by, for example, informing the minor of the tracing
             facilities of the Red Cross. It will eventually  be  necessary
             to examine  each  of  the  cases  in  detail  but  I  have  no
             hesitation in saying that, if that was all that was  done,  it
             would not discharge the  duty  to  endeavour  to  trace.  This
             conclusion is supported by DS  (Afghanistan)  v  Secretary  of
             State for the Home Department [2011] EWCA Civ  305,  in  which
             Pill LJ said (at paragraphs 46-47):


                    "I readily acknowledge the difficulties which may  arise
                    on the making of enquiries  ...  In  the  present  case,
                    however, the Secretary of State did nothing  at  all  to
                    assist with tracing family members or to  enquire  about
                    reception arrangements on return and the court has  been
                    invited to uphold that inactivity  ...  What  should  be
                    done will vary from case to case.  Inactivity,  combined
                    with the failure  to  bring  to  the  attention  of  the
                    Tribunal the instruments cited  in  this  judgment,  was
                    not, in my view, a permissible option.
                    The Secretary of State seeks  to  defeat  the  claim  by
                    reason of the appellant's failure to cooperate with  the
                    Red  Cross.  Tracing  work  by  the  ICRC  would  almost
                    certainly have been assisted by a contribution from  the
                    Secretary of State, based on  information  available  to
                    her. The  lack  of  cooperation  does  not  relieve  the
                    Secretary of State of her duties ... the duty cannot  be
                    ignored."


             17. Having accepted that there was a systemic  breach  of  the
             duty to endeavour to trace, I now  have  to  consider  whether
             that may trigger the Rashid/S principle. It is  a  complicated
             question and not  simply  a  matter  of  the  systemic  breach
             entitling these appellants, without more ado, to the  allowing
             of their appeals with remittal to the Secretary  of  State  to
             consider grants of leave  to  remain,  which  is  the  primary
             relief sought. Nor does it admit of  the  simplistic  analysis
             that the appellants were over 18 when their cases came  before
             the FTT or the UT and, as a consequence and in accordance with
             the Ravichandran principle, the breach had  become  irrelevant
             to the requisite consideration of their cases by reference  to
             the circumstances prevailing at the time of the hearings. When
             the  Rashid/S  principle  applies,  it  modifies  the   strict
             application of Ravichandran.
             22. In HK it was submitted on behalf of the Secretary of State
             that the duty to endeavour to trace is quite distinct from the
             processing of an asylum application. Elias LJ (with whom  Pill
             and Rimer LJJ agreed) said (at paragraph 40)


                    "... the regulation 6 duty is in terms said to arise  as
                    soon as an  asylum  application  is  lodged  and  it  is
                    plainly intimately connected with the  determination  of
                    that  application.  This  suggests  that  it  should  be
                    treated as a necessary element in the  determination  of
                    an asylum application."


             However, he went on to conclude that failure to discharge  the
             duty to endeavour to trace does not lead  axiomatically  to  a
             successful outcome for the child's application on  appeal.  It
             is necessary for there to be a careful  consideration  of  the
             facts of each individual case.
             25...At the other end of the spectrum is  an  applicant  whose
             claim  to  have  no  surviving  family   in   Afghanistan   is
             disbelieved and in respect of whom it is  found  that  he  has
             been uncooperative so as to frustrate any attempt to trace his
             family. In such a case, again depending  on  the  totality  of
             established facts, he may have put himself beyond the bite  of
             the protective and corrective principle.
             26...Even in the context of a clear  breach  of  the  duty  to
             endeavour  to  trace,  a  tribunal  will  retain   a   certain
             robustness in assessing the evidence of a young person who has
             demonstrated a deep-rooted resistance to being returned to his
             country of origin.


      8. I do not attempt to predict the outcome of the argument in relation
         to the duty of the Secretary of State to have endeavoured to  trace
         the appellant's family or, indeed, whether such a duty arose in the
         circumstances of this appeal. However, there is no reason  why  the
         appellant should not be permitted to raise it in the context of  an
         Article  8  claim  as  well  as  the  relevance  of  an   'historic
         illegality' (if such it be).
