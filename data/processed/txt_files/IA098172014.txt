Representation:
For the Appellant:     Miss Imamovic, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Miss C Johnstone, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Vietnam born on 24th  January  1983.   On
    7th September 2007 the Appellant was issued with a residence card valid
    until 7th September 2012.  On 9th December 2011 the  Appellant  applied
    for a permanent residence card and the application was rejected on 29th
    May 2012.  On 5th September 2012 the Appellant applied for a  permanent
    residence card as the former spouse  of  an  EEA  national  and  for  a
    derivative residence card as the primary carer of a British citizen.

 2. The Appellant appears to have been subject to two  Notices  of  Refusal
    arising  thereafter.   On  5th  September  2013  her  application   for
    permanent residence on the basis of being a non-EEA  national  who  has
    retained a right of residence after the termination of her marriage  to
    Pascal Bounaud was refused as was the Appellant's application  pursuant
    to  Article  8  of  the  European  Convention  of  Human  Rights.    By
    supplementary Notice of Refusal it was recorded that the Appellant  had
    appealed  the  decision  dated  2nd  September  2013  to   refuse   her
    application and the appeal was withdrawn prior to being  heard  by  the
    Secretary of State to give consideration to Regulation 18A,  Article  8
    of the European Convention on Human  Rights  and  because  the  child's
    father had provided evidence that he is  not,  and  will  not  be,  the
    child's primary carer.

 3. The Appellant appealed and the appeal came before Judge of  the  First-
    tier  Tribunal  Edwards  on  30th  June  2014.   In   a   determination
    promulgated on 4th July 2014 the Appellant's appeal was dismissed  both
    under the EEA Regulations and under the Human Rights Act.

 4. On 15th July 2014 the Appellant lodged Grounds of Appeal to  the  Upper
    Tribunal.  On 3rd  September  2014  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Andrew
    granted permission to appeal.  Judge  Andrew  noted  that  the  grounds
    complained that the judge did not take notes of all the  evidence  that
    was before him when reaching his  conclusions.   In  his  findings  the
    judge made no reference to the documents in the Appellant's bundle  and
    thus it was not apparent whether or not he attached any weight to  them
    in reaching his findings.  In such circumstances he was satisfied there
    was an arguable error of law in the determination.

 5. On 15th September 2014 the Secretary of State responded to the  Grounds
    of Appeal under Rule 24.  The Rule 24 response  notes  that  the  judge
    referred to the  documents  before  him  under  the  heading  "material
    considered at paragraph 5."  They contend that it was  clear  that  the
    judge had the Appellant's bundle and further that the judge  had  noted
    that  the  bundle  was  chaotic  which  indicated  that  he  must  have
    considered it to have formed that view.  The Rule 24 response contended
    that the judge was not obliged to  list  or  refer  to  every  document
    before him and that he had given clear reasons  for  finding  that  the
    Appellant did not discharge the burden of proof.

 6. It was on that basis that  the  appeal  came  before  me  to  determine
    whether or not there was a material error of law in the decision of the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge.  Thereafter I made the  following  findings.
    In order to qualify for a right to reside under  the  judgment  of  the
    European  Court  in  Ruiz  Zambrano   (C34/09)   the   Appellant   must
    demonstrate:-

         (a)  that he or she is the primary carer of a British citizen;

         (b)  that the relevant British citizen is resident  in  the  United
             Kingdom; and

         (c)  the relevant British citizen would be unable to reside in  the
             UK or in another EE state if the Appellant  were  required  to
             leave.

 7. The definition of primary carer is set  out  under  Regulation  15A(7).
    The question arises as to whether or not as a matter of fact or law the
    judge has addressed this point.  Witness statements were available  but
    the judge chose allegedly not to refer to all of the evidence.   It  is
    incumbent upon a judge to give due consideration to  all  the  evidence
    even if it is only read through  consideration  in  the  event  that  a
    witness fails to attend court.  Neither of  the  legal  representatives
    who appeared before me on the error of law hearing appeared before  the
    First-tier Tribunal.  It is difficult to ascertain what weight, if any,
    the First-tier Tribunal Judge gave in such circumstances to the witness
    evidence.  His determination centres on three short paragraphs and does
    not address any alternative  witness  evidence.   As  to  whether  that
    evidence would or would not have been material  remained  a  matter  of
    conjecture.

 8. However much was made of the manner in which  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge has or has not addressed the issue relating to Mr Hoang's letter.
     Whilst the judge was perfectly entitled to make  findings  as  to  his
    impression  of  the  Appellant's  evidence  I  was  satisfied  that  he
    misinterpreted factually Mr Hoang's letter.  He stated therein that  Mr
    Hoang's role was minimised by the evidence of the Appellant.   That  is
    not consistent with what Mr Hoang stated in his letter.  He stated:

         "Amy's mother has looked after her since birth  and  has  the  sole
         responsibility for her.  Nguyen lives in Manchester and has her own
         business there.  She has solely been responsible for Amy's  welfare
         and upbringing without any input from me.  Due to the fact that  we
         are not in a relationship and I live in London where I work,  I  am
         unable to share any parental responsibilities with Nguyen  or  look
         after Amy without her mother."

 9. These are very clear, and seemingly, open and  honest  statements  from
    Amy's father.  They certainly do not sit well with the finding made  by
    the First-tier Tribunal Judge at paragraph 24 that "the  Appellant  has
    not discharged the onus on her to establish that she  has  the  primary
    responsibility for Amy's care."  It is  completely  incumbent  upon  an
    Immigration Judge as set out in MK (Duty to  Give  Reasons)  (Pakistan)
    [2013] UKUT 641  (IAC)  that  it  is  axiomatic  that  a  determination
    discloses clearly the reasons for a Tribunal decision.  If  a  Tribunal
    finds oral evidence to be implausible, incredible or  unreliable  or  a
    document to be worth no weight whatsoever it is necessary to say so  in
    the determination and for such findings to be supported by reasons.   A
    bare statement that a witness was not believed or that a  document  was
    afforded no weight is unlikely  to  satisfy  the  requirement  to  give
    reasons.

10. That scenario it seemed to me occurred in this  determination.   Whilst
    acknowledging that the First-tier Tribunal Judge heard the  evidence  I
    was satisfied he failed to give adequate reasons for his decision which
    was based on three very short paragraphs.  He was right in saying  that
    it is a requirement of the Appellant to place credible evidence  before
    him and for  her  to  discharge  the  burden  of  proof.   In  all  the
    circumstances it seemed that it was possible that  there  may  well  be
    clear evidence available that the Appellant meets the  requirements  of
    paragraph 15 of the 2006 Regulations but that is a matter  for  further
    argument.   There  was  clearly  a  material  error  of  law  in   such
    circumstances in the reasoning and finding of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge.  Bearing in mind that the issue of Article 8  has  already  been
    conceded it seemed to  me  that  the  best  and  most  just  method  of
    proceeding with this matter was to find material errors of law  in  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  both  with  regard  to  his
    conclusions under the EEA Regulations and pursuant to Article 8 of  the
    European Convention of Human Rights and to set aside  the  decision  on
    both grounds and for me to proceed to re-hear the appeal.

11. I handed down directions re-listing the matter for re-hearing  pursuant
    to the Appellant's appeal under the EEA Regulations 2006 and Article  8
    of the European Convention on Human Rights reserved to  myself  on  the
    first available date after 1st April 2015 with an estimated  length  of
    hearing of three hours.  I granted leave to either party to file an up-
    to-date bundle of evidence, skeleton  arguments  and  authorities  upon
    which they intended to rely.

12. It is on that basis that the appeal returns before me  for  re-hearing.
    The Appellant appears by her instructed Counsel,  Miss  Imamovic.   The
    Secretary of State appears by her Home Office Presenting Officer,  Miss
    Johnstone.  There are up-to-date bundles served in accordance  with  my
    directions from the Appellant's legal representatives.   Miss  Imamovic
    provides me with a skeleton argument and up-to-date bundles including a
    further witness statement from the Appellant dated 7th October 2015.  I
    am also  particularly  referred  to  the  European  Operational  Team's
    Directive on derivative rights of residence issued in December 2012 and
    by Miss Johnstone to Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules in particular
    Section E-LTRPT.

13. There is one preliminary issue.  Back in January I  granted  permission
    to appeal both under the EEA Regulations and pursuant to  the  European
    Convention on Human Rights.   Subsequent  to  that  finding  the  Upper
    Tribunal ruled in Amirteymour and Others (EEA  appeals;  human  rights)
    [2015] UKUT 00466 (IAC) that where no notice under Section 120  of  the
    2002 Act has been served and where no EEA decision to remove  has  been
    made, an Appellant cannot bring a human rights challenge to removal  in
    an appeal under the  EEA  Regulations.   Miss  Imamovic  concedes  that
    position and advises that the appeal therefore that is extant before me
    is solely one relating to the Appellant's appeal pursuant  to  the  EEA
    Regulations and that the appeal pursuant to Article 8 of  the  European
    Convention on Human Rights is abandoned.

Evidence

14. The Appellant relies  on  the  evidence  given  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal and in addition her witness statement dated 7th October  2015.
    The Appellant states that she arrived in  the  United  Kingdom  legally
    from France on 29th May 2004 along with her ex-husband who was a French
    national.  However in 2008 her ex-husband left the UK in order  to  see
    his mother in France and never came back and despite  several  attempts
    the Appellant was unable to contact him.  The Appellant started her own
    business as a nail technician in or about 2011.  Prior to that she  had
    entered a relationship with a British citizen Mr Huy Quang Hoang.  As a
    result of a relationship between them the Appellant's daughter Amy  was
    born on 24th May 2010.  However her relationship with Mr Hoang was  not
    sustained and since her birth Amy  has  lived  with  the  Appellant  in
    Manchester while her father lives and works in  London.   She  contends
    that she has had sole parental responsibility for the  child  and  that
    Amy's father has had very few contacts with her and has never  provided
    any financial or moral support.

15. In additional evidence-in-chief the Appellant advises that at the birth
    of Amy two friends and an interpreter were present but not Amy's father
    and that since her birth Mr Hoang has only seen Amy on a few  occasions
    and that he has never been left alone with her.   She  emphasises  that
    the last time there was any contact between Amy and her father was  two
    years ago and that it has been Mr Hoang's choice rather  than  her  own
    for there to be no contact maintained.  She states that she  has  heard
    via friends that his life has changed in that he has a new family and a
    new life.

16. She advises that she set up her  own  business  as  a  nail  technician
    because she wanted to create a future for herself  and  her  child  and
    that she was responsible for registering Amy with the  authorities  and
    for the obtaining of her NHS medical card.  Further  she  has  arranged
    for Amy to be baptised because she is a member of the  Catholic  faith.
    She refers to evidence produced  within  the  bundle  relating  to  her
    daughter's registration with the NHS and her baptism.  In addition  she
    states that she has set up a trust fund for  Amy  and  that  she  saved
    money to put into this account.

17. The Appellant is referred to the letter from Mr  Hoang  from  September
    2013 with regard to contact.  The Appellant  acknowledges  that  letter
    and states that she has  tried  to  make  efforts  for  contact  to  be
    arranged by contacting Mr Hoang's place of employment but that she  was
    unable to speak to him because his employer  said  he  was  not  there.
    Further she has left a message on his last known contact number but  he
    has not responded.  She emphasises that she has  not  spoken  to  Amy's
    father for over two years and that it was through friends of  hers  she
    was advised that he has a new family.  She  emphasises  that  Mr  Hoang
    knows where she lives and that it is open to him to contact her  should
    he seek to have contact but again emphasises that all contact that  had
    ever taken place with Amy has been supervised.

18. Under cross-examination the  Appellant  confirms  that  she  has  never
    approached the CSA and that she  does  not  claim  tax  credit  or  any
    benefits other than child benefit and that the  reason  that  she  does
    this is that she prefers to support  herself  and  her  daughter.   She
    advises that she has an income in the region  of  �1,200  to  �1,300  a
    month and that she lives in rented accommodation.   She  confirms  that
    she speaks to Amy in Vietnamese but she also speaks to her  in  English
    and that Amy attends school where the language spoken is English.   She
    advises that she has taken an English language course  albeit  only  to
    level 1 and refers to the certificate relating  to  same  to  be  found
    within her bundle.

19. Miss Johnstone makes reference in cross-examination to  an  alternative
    route that the Appellant could take for immigration status pursuant  to
    Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules by making an application for leave
    to remain as a parent of a British  citizen.   It  is  clear  from  the
    response given by the Appellant that she is unaware of this  route  and
    that the advice given to her as to how she should make her  application
    has come from her legal representatives.

Submission/Discussion

20. It is Miss Johnstone's  submission  that  the  Notices  of  Refusal  be
    considered and that the Appellant has not shown that Amy would have  to
    leave the UK if the Appellant were required to leave and she relies  on
    the letter from Amy's father from 2013.  Further she acknowledges  that
    the Appellant has given additional oral testimony today but states that
    there  is  little  documentary  evidence  to  support  most  of   those
    contentions.  She further emphasises that it would still be open to the
    Appellant to apply as a parent under Appendix  FM  of  the  Immigration
    Rules.  She asked me to dismiss the appeal.

21. Miss Imamovic relies on her skeleton argument  pointing  out  that  the
    questions to be asked are whether or not the Appellant is  the  primary
    carer and if so would depriving her of her residence card  require  Amy
    to leave the UK.  She submits that there has been  sufficient  evidence
    to show that responsibility is not shared pointing  out  that  Amy  has
    resided with her mother since birth, that the Appellant takes the major
    decisions in Amy's life and that she is even  investing  from  her  low
    income in Amy's future and that all the indications are  the  Appellant
    is Amy's primary carer.  She points out that Amy's father  now  appears
    to have no contact whatsoever and that it would be wrong to deprive the
    Appellant of her residence card and invite her  to  leave  particularly
    bearing in mind the lack of contact and that Amy's father has never had
    any care and control of Amy.  She points out that it  appears  that  Mr
    Hoang is both unable and unwilling to assist the Appellant and there is
    nothing before the Tribunal to suggest that the  Appellant's  testimony
    is not credible.  She submits that the Appellant has given a reasonable
    explanation of her attempts to contact Amy's father and that the appeal
    should be allowed.

The Law

22. The Appellant's claim is based on paragraph 15A of the EEA  Regulations
    2006 which stipulates when a person who is  not  an  exempt  person  is
    entitled to a derivative right to reside in the  UK  as  long  as  they
    satisfy the relevant criteria.   The  relevant  paragraphs  herein  are
    paragraph (4A) namely that a person  satisfies  the  criteria  in  this
    paragraph if:

          a) the person is the primary carer of a British citizen;

          b) the  relevant  British  citizen  is  residing  in  the  United
             Kingdom, and

          c) the relevant British citizen would be unable to reside in  the
             UK or in another EE state  if  the  person  were  required  to
             leave.

    Further under Regulation 15A(7)(a)(b)(i) a person is to be regarded  as
    a primary carer if the person is a direct relative or legal guardian of
    that person and is the person who has primary responsibility  for  that
    person's care.

Findings

23. I am invited by Miss Imamovic to find that the Appellant is the primary
    carer of Amy who is an EEA child pursuant to  Regulations  15A(4A)  and
    15A(7)(a)(b)(i).  She emphasises that the Appellant does not share  the
    responsibility with the EEA child's father.  I have heard the  evidence
    and I am totally satisfied that the Appellant is the primary  carer  of
    Amy and that there is  no  shared  responsibility  with  Amy's  father.
    Indeed Amy's father appears  not  to  have  any  involvement  with  his
    daughter.  I acknowledge that new oral testimony in addition to that in
    the Appellant's witness statement has been provided  at  this  hearing.
    It is however wrong of Miss Johnstone to state that  such  evidence  is
    totally uncorroborated particularly with regard to  Amy's  registration
    with the NHS and her baptism both of which have supportive  documentary
    evidence provided within the Appellant's instructed solicitor's bundle.

24. I have given due  consideration  to  the  European  Operational  Policy
    Guidance set out at paragraphs 18 and 19.  Further there is nothing  to
    suggest that the testimony provided by the Appellant is  not  credible.
    Her credibility has not been challenged by Miss Johnstone  albeit  Miss
    Johnstone has quite properly pointed out that the new evidence produced
    should be given  limited  weight  due  to  its  lateness  and  lack  of
    corroboration.  However that is not to say that the  Appellant  is  not
    credible.  She has given reasonable explanations and  it  is  difficult
    not to be impressed with this Appellant.  She does not claim  any  form
    of working tax credit (albeit that it may well be on her income she  is
    entitled to), she  makes  savings  through  a  trust  account  for  her
    daughter and it is clear that she is working hard  as  a  self-employed
    nail technician with every intention of devoting  seemingly  her  whole
    life to supporting her daughter and giving her a better future.  She is
    equally clear that Amy's natural father has had no contact for over two
    years and even then that contact was supervised.  It does not sit  well
    for the Secretary of State to try and rely on a letter over  two  years
    old indicating that Mr Hoang would like to be in a position to  play  a
    part of Amy's life.  The facts seem to state quite clearly that he does
    not do so.

25. It would be difficult in such circumstances to find a case where  there
    is not clearer evidence that the Appellant is the primary carer.  Amy's
    father neither contributes financially, physically  or  emotionally  to
    Amy's upbringing.  It is appropriate to mention the submission made  by
    Miss Johnstone that it would be open under Section E-LTRPT of  Appendix
    FM for the Appellant to apply for limited leave to remain as  a  parent
    of a British citizen.  As Miss Imamovic points out that is true  albeit
    that it would be necessary to meet the criteria therein.  That does not
    mean that the Appellant has to do so.  She has chosen, almost certainly
    on the advice of legal representatives, to go down the route of seeking
    a permanent residence card as the former spouse of an EEA national  and
    for a derivative residence card as  the  primary  carer  of  a  British
    citizen.  That is an option the Regulations allow her to  follow.   She
    cannot be criticised for so doing.

26. In all the circumstances and for all  the  reasons  given  above  I  am
    completely  satisfied  that  this  is  an  Appellant  who   meets   the
    requirements of Regulation 15A of  the  2006  Regulations  and  is  the
    primary carer of Amy who is a British citizen who resides in the UK and
    who would be unable to reside in the UK or in another EEA state if  the
    Appellant were required to leave.  Therefore for all the above  reasons
    the Appellant's appeal must succeed.

Decision

The Appellant's  appeal  under  the  Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)
Regulations 2006 is allowed.

No anonymity direction is made.
