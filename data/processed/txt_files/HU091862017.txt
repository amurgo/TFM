                           ENTRY CLEARANCE OFFICER
                                                                  Respondent


For the Appellant:     Ms N Loughran, of Loughran & Co, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr A Govan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals against a decision by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Handley, promulgated  on  18  September  2018,  dismissing  her  appeal
    against refusal of entry clearance as a spouse.

 2. Mr Govan conceded as follows.  The judge's conclusion that there was no
    genuine relationship between the appellant  and  the  sponsor  involved
    error, as suggested in the grounds and in the grant of  permission,  by
    overlooking evidence of financial transfers, of  other  communications,
    and of  constraints  on  evidencing  communications  for  part  of  the
    relevant period.  Parties agreed that the appropriate  outcome  was  as
    follows.

 3. The decision of the FtT is set aside. It stands only  as  a  record  of
    what was said at the hearing.

 4. The nature of the case is such that it is appropriate under section  12
    of the 2007 Act, and under Practice Statement 7.2, to remit to the  FtT
    for an entirely fresh hearing.

 5. The member(s) of the FtT chosen to consider the case are not to include
    Judge Handley.

 6. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
