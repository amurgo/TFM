Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Clarke, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms Ahmad, Counsel


                          DECISION ON JURISDICTION

    1. The appellant ('the SSHD') has appealed against a decision of  First-
       tier Tribunal Judge Chamberlain dated 22 May 2015 in which he allowed
       the respondent's appeal under the Immigration Rules.

    2. In succinct grounds of appeal the SSHD  argued  that  the  First-tier
       Tribunal had no jurisdiction to hear the appeal.  After hearing  from
       Mr Clarke, Ms Ahmad conceded that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  had  no
       jurisdiction, and neither does the  Upper  Tribunal.   Ms  Ahmad  was
       entirely correct to make this submission.  As  the  matter  has  been
       conceded I provide a summary of my  reasons  for  agreeing  with  the
       parties that the First-tier Tribunal had no jurisdiction.

    3. The SSHD made  a  decision  dated  27  October  2014  to  remove  the
       respondent on the basis that he was guilty of  deception  in  seeking
       leave to remain in the United Kingdom (UK) and as such he could  only
       appeal after he had left the UK.  That this is correct is clear  from
       sections 82(g) and 92 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act
       2002.  Ms Ahmad accepted that human rights submissions were not  made
       prior to the removal decision and as such section 92(4) of  the  2002
       Act did not avail the respondent -  see  R  (on  the  application  of
       Nirula) v SSHD [2012] EWCA Civ 1436 at [17 to 25].

    4. The acceptance that the First-tier Tribunal had  no  jurisdiction  to
       decide this appeal because the respondent did not have an  in-country
       right of appeal is sufficient to dispose of these  proceedings.   The
       First-tier Tribunal did not have jurisdiction.
