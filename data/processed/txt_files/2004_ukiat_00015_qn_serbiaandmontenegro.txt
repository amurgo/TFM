Representatives:

For the claimant:      Mr M Shamim, counsel instructed by K Zaman Ali & Co

For the respondent:        Miss J Sigley



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   This is an appeal by an Albanian citizen of Kosovo against the  decision
   of an adjudicator, Mr K St.J Wiseman sitting at Epsom on  12  May  2003.
   The claimant arrived here on 31 August 1999 and claimed asylum the  next
   day.  He did not receive a decision from the Home Office until 2 January
   2002 and, for no good reason that we can see, the appeal bundle was  not
   sent to the appellate authorities by the Home Office until  19  February
   2003.  The adjudicator's decision eventually went out on 18  June  2003,
   so could only be challenged on a point of law. Leave was  given  on  the
   Article 8 grounds only and specifically on the point of the delay by the
   Home Office. We shall be considering that issue  on  the  whole  of  the
   evidence before us.



2. The adjudicator dealt as follows with the leading decision on this  kind
   of point which is Shala [2003] EWCA Civ 233:



      5. It is an important case but it  still  does  stress  the  balancing
         exercise that has to be carried out under Article 8(2) particularly
         in a case where there has been a  marriage  and  perhaps  a  family
         created during the long period of delay.

      6. It may perhaps be arbitrary but the  appellant  in  this  case  has
         simply got on quietly  with  his  life  and  has  obviously  worked
         responsibly.  He has not however entered into a fresh  relationship
         let alone marriage or urged  anything  in  particular  upon  me  in
         respect of Article 8 through his representatives.  Of course in the
         light of Arben Shala there are going to be  clearly  arguments  put
         forward in different cases  as  to  what  constitutes  unreasonable
         delay in the case of  a  hard  pressed  government  department.   I
         perhaps only need say that the delay is quite considerable in  this
         case but it has had only modest repercussions.



3. The case put forward for the claimant by Mr Shamim revolves  around  his
   private rather than family life.  It  is  essentially  set  out  in  the
   letters before us from the managing directors of two building firms  for
   which he has worked, who speak  about  him  in  glowing  terms,  clearly
   regarding him as entirely trustworthy and someone who fits in well  with
   his fellow workers and with customers.  They make  the  point  that  his
   employment has been  entirely  legal  throughout.   As  the  adjudicator
   pointed out, this claimant has not acquired a family  in  this  country,
   but has simply got on with his life. We are entirely prepared to  assume
   that he has made the usual social as well as work contacts.

4. It does not require any reference to authority to show that  may  amount
   to a private life in this country, interference with  which  by  removal
   does need to be considered in terms  of  article  8.   The  question  is
   whether such interference would be justifiable  in  light  of  what  the
   Court of Appeal  has  (in  Djali  [2003]  EWCA  Civ  1371)  called  "the
   imperative and overriding  interest  of  immigration  control".   So  we
   return to Shala.  That was a case where the  claimant  had  arrived  and
   claimed asylum in June 1997, been refused in July 2001  and  his  appeal
   dismissed in November that year.  He had started living with the lady in
   his life some time in 1998; so there had been  considerable  delay  even
   after that had happened.

5. The crucial difference in our view between this case and that  of  Shala
   turns on the time when the claim was made in the two cases.    In  Shala
   the claim was made when, as the Court of Appeal note at paragraph  9  of
   their decision, the Home Office policy was such that someone from Kosovo
   would have been granted refugee status, or at least exceptional leave to
   remain.  This policy came to an end, as they  say  there,  in  mid-1999,
   after the NATO intervention in June that year.  If the Home  Office  had
   decided this claimant's case within a reasonable time after he made  his
   claim, which is to say towards the end of  1999,  then  no  such  policy
   would have applied.

6. The ratio of Shala can be seen at the end of paragraph 15,

   The appellant did have a legitimate claim to enter at a time when on any
   reasonable basis his claim should have been determined.  Put another way
   the fact that delay by the Home Office has deprived him  that  advantage
   should  be  seen  as  an  exceptional  circumstance  which   takes   the
   appellant's case out of the normal run of cases where a person  with  no
   leave to enter seeks such leave on the basis of marriage.



7. This claimant got on with his life in an extremely sensible  way,  which
   does him a great deal of credit, and we also regard it as to his  credit
   that he has  not  sought  to  put  forward  any  factitious  family-type
   relationship.  However, the Home  Office  delay  has  not  been  to  his
   detriment in the same way as it was in Shala.  He can certainly complain
   about  a  gross  delay  by  the  Home  Office   in   terms   of   simple
   maladministration: what he cannot say, as Shala could, is that he  would
   have been granted even exceptional leave to remain, and  so  been  in  a
   significantly better position (in that case,  to  pursue  an  in-country
   marriage appeal), if his case had been dealt with when  it  should  have
   been.

8. It follows, in our view, that the principle stated  in  Shala  does  not
   apply in this case.  The Court of Appeal said themselves that Shala, and
   we quote here from the judgment of Lord Justice Schiemann  at  paragraph
   24, was "distinguishable from the mass of cases"  because  of  the  time
   when that claimant arrived.  We have every sympathy for  this  claimant;
   but in our view the adjudicator was entirely justified in coming to  the
   decision  that  his  removal  would  not  be  disproportionate  to   the
   legitimate purpose of immigration control in terms of article 8, and  it
   follows that the appeal is dismissed.

                                                                       [pic]

                                                                  (chairman)
