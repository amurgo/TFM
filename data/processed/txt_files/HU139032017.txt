Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr A Mackenzie, counsel instructed by TRP Solicitors

For the Respondent:    Mr D Mills, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    The  Appellant,  a  national  of   Nigeria,   appealed   against   the
    Respondent's decision to refuse to revoke  a  deportation  decision  on
    ECHR grounds.

2.   That decision, dated 8 December  2017,  maintained  the  basis  of  the
    decision with reference to paragraph 399A of the Immigration Rules  and
    with reference to the human rights basis to remain.  The  Appellant  is
    married to a British national and has two children who are  of  British
    nationality.  His appeal against that decision came  before  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Owens who, on 27 April 2018,  dismissed  the  appeal  on
    human rights grounds.

3.   On 28 August 2019 Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Plimmer  concluded  that  the
    Original Tribunal's decision disclosed an error of law  and  could  not
    stand and the matter was to be remade in  the  Upper  Tribunal  by  any
    Upper Tribunal Judge.  Directions were given to  update  the  evidence,
    but in substance the parties and the judge agreed that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge's findings of fact could be preserved.

4.   The positive and negative findings are comprehensively set out  in  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge's decision.

5.   The judge had set out the basis of the Appellant's case and heard  oral
    evidence which was tested  in  cross-examination  and  the  Appellant's
    partner, Ms [B], similarly gave evidence and was  cross-examined.   The
    judge, having set out the position in terms of the law, then set out  a
    number of  facts  found  as  to  the  seriousness  of  the  Appellant's
    offending and the sustainable basis on which the public interest had in
    deportation, given the criminality of the Appellant.  In  view  of  the
    convictions which had arisen, he therefore looked  at  the  deportation
    decision with reference to Section 117C(2) of  the  NIAA  2002  in  the
    context of the ECHR provisions as reflected in the  Immigration  Rules.
    He also took into account the relevant IDI guidance of  February  2017,
    and the fact that the Appellant had been in the United Kingdom for over
    twenty years and, in that context, his criminality.

6.   I therefore look at it in the context of  the  Appellant's  convictions
    on multiple counts of fraud for which he was sentenced to  three  years
    and three months' imprisonment and thus rated as a medium offender, and
    the case law which clearly has in mind medium offenders reflected in NA
    (Pakistan) v SSHD [2017] 1 WLR  2007.  The issue was therefore, in  the
    context of Section 117C(5) of the NIAA 2002  ,whether  his  deportation
    would have an unduly harsh effect on his two children  and  partner  if
    they were to remain in the UK without him.

7.   The judge had concluded [D65] that taking into account  the  importance
    of the children's nationality and the oldest child's wish to remain  in
    the UK; where they were entitled to be; had better prospects,  as  well
    as the opinion  of  the  independent  social  worker  as  to  the  best
    interests of the children. The judge found it was unduly harsh for  the
    children to relocate to Nigeria with their  parents.   Thus  the  judge
    went on to consider the impact on the children in being in  the  UK  in
    the absence of their father, it being accepted that it is in  the  best
    interests of the children, so far as possible, to grow up  knowing  and
    having a meaningful relationship with both parents [D67].

8.   I do not take into  account  in  considering  this  issue  the  serious
    nature and  gravity  of  the  Appellant's  offending  and  his  adverse
    immigration history.  The situation therefore was I  proceeded  on  the
    findings that were made as to the immigration history of the  Appellant
    (set out in D1-3) and the details of his offending [D4 and D36-37].   I
    also take into account the findings of the First-tier Tribunal  arising
    from the issues now in consideration, in particular that the  Appellant
    enjoyed a close family life with his partner and children [D28 and 29].
     Secondly, the conclusions of the independent social worker, Ms Harris,
    dated 29 March 2018, which were accepted in their entirety by the Judge
    [D72] and in particular the conclusions that:-

         "... the loss of the  children's  father  will  cause  his  partner
         feelings of grief at the loss of her partner which would reduce her
         coping mechanisms.  Both children are likely  to  experience  grief
         and loss including  associated  feelings  and  behaviours  such  as
         anger, self-blame and sadness leading to lower self-esteem and self-
         confidence reducing overall wellbeing.  In addition,  the  physical
         barriers caused by location would  prevent  physical  contact  with
         their father for the foreseeable future."

9.   Ms Harris asserted that losing the access to their  primary  carer  was
    likely to cause disruption to  the  children's  routine  and  stability
    which may impact on their educational progress and development.  It was
    concluded by Ms Harris that the Appellant would not be able to  provide
    the  children  with  the  same  level  of  emotional,   practical   and
    educational support and  would  have  a  detrimental  impact  on  their
    continuing positive identity formation as British  citizens  causing  a
    reduction  in  their  self-esteem  and  self-confidence.    The   judge
    concluded in summary [D73] the absence of the Appellant  would  have  a
    significant detrimental effect on  his  children's  development,  self-
    esteem and self-confidence and that their mother will find it harder to
    cope on her own.  Thus, not only did the children's best interests  lie
    in being in the UK with their father and mother, but also the  presence
    of the father in the UK would have better long-term prospects  for  the
    two  children.   The  children  at  the  material  time  were   British
    nationals, [JO] was born on 12 March 2011 and [AO], was born on 9  June
    2014.

10.  The  report  of  Ms  Harris  and  her  conclusions  therefore  were  in
    substance  that  the   Appellant   effectively   would   be   separated
    permanently, if removed from the children, as the family's funds  would
    not stretch to travelling to see him.  The Judge considered this matter
    [D76] and also concluded that whilst there  were  difficulties  through
    technical problems in maintaining contact,  nevertheless  the  children
    could speak  with  their  father  by  phone  regularly  and  use  other
    communications such as Skype. The Judge recognised such contact was not
    the same meaningful quality as that between a parent and child face  to
    face.  The Judge perhaps  surprisingly  concluded  that  the  Appellant
    living in a  different  country  will  not  separate  from  the  family
    permanently and that the Appellant could have a relationship  with  his
    partner and children, albeit:-

         "... one of a lesser quality and he is not precluded from  applying
         to revoke  the  deportation  order  after  a  suitable  period  has
         elapsed".

    I do not speculate on when such an application could  be  made  or  the
    prospects of success.

11.  The report of Ms Harris, so far as  I  am  aware,  remained  unchanged.
    The Appellant's evidence to update the matter relating to the children,
    [JO] and [AO], spoke essentially to his continuing involvement in their
    daily activities, collection from school, sporting activities  and  the
    re-establishment of that relationship with them both since his  release
    from prison.  He also spoke, which was unchallenged, to the  extent  he
    was involved in their education assisting them in  their  homework  and
    studies and the differences in their behaviour and mood in his  absence
    and since his return and the improvement that he has clearly seen.   In
    addition, he recognised the extent to which his conduct has  led  to  a
    burden upon his partner.  He confirmed, and this  was  not  challenged,
    the extent to which his absence had had an impact upon his partner  and
    children, and the difficulties his partner  had  had  in  coping.   The
    Appellant has completed, whilst on probation, two courses  directed  at
    helping people avoiding reoffending and  the  Appellant  reasserts  his
    shame and remorse and his determination not to  reoffend  and  take  up
    work as and when he is allowed.

12.  The question that really must be  answered  was  whether  the  evidence
    sufficient to show that the common place consequences of someone  being
    detained and separated from  their  family,  which  would  not  in  the
    ordinary course of  events  be  regarded  as  unduly  harsh,  were  not
    justified by reference to the wellbeing of the children.  The  case  of
    JG [2019] EWCA Civ 982 has in many respects  different  facts,  but  in
    that case there clearly were issues over the mental health of the child
    and the possibilities of psychological damage from the absence  of  the
    father of  the  child.   The  case  of  JG  demonstrated  the  kind  of
    considerations sufficient to amount to it being unduly harsh within the
    context of Section 117C(5) NIAA 2002.

13.  It is said that greater help is to be  found  in  the  decision  of  PG
    (Jamaica) [2019] EWCA Civ 1213 in which Mr Justice Holroyde said [D39]:-



         "Formulating the issue in that way, there is in my  view  only  one
         answer to the question.  I recognise of course the human  realities
         of the situation, and I do not doubt that SAT (the  Appellant)  and
         the three children will suffer great distress if  PG  is  deported.
         Nor do I doubt that their lives will in a number of  ways  be  made
         more difficult than they are at present. But those, sadly, are  the
         likely consequences of the deportation of any foreign criminal  who
         has a genuine and subsisting relationship  with  a  partner  and/or
         children in this country."

    He accepted the submissions of counsel for the Secretary of State as to
    the point and agreed with the point that:-

         "Many parents of teenage children are confronted with  difficulties
         and upsetting events of one sort or another and have to face one or
         more of their children going through 'a difficult period'  for  one
         reason or another and the fact that  a  parent  who  is  a  foreign
         criminal will no  longer  be  in  a  position  to  assist  in  such
         circumstances cannot  of  itself  mean  that  the  effects  of  his
         deportation are unduly harsh for his partner and/or children."

14.  It was thus said by Mr Mills that it  was  quite  a  difficult  factual
    threshold to establish that something was unduly harsh: In other  words
    the degree of harshness goes beyond that  necessarily  involved  for  a
    partner or children of a foreign criminal facing deportation.

15.  Mr Mackenzie argued with reference to JG (Jamaica) 12 June 2019 (PG  is
    11 July 2019), that in JG [2019] EWCA Civ 982, that the threshold of it
    being unduly harsh was met if there was evidence showing a harsh effect
    on a child which went in  any  way  beyond  what  was  normally  to  be
    expected where the parent was deported.  It was not necessary that  the
    effect should go substantially  or  extensively  beyond  that  normally
    expected.  He argued that the question - whether the harsh effect  goes
    materially  beyond  that  which  is  normally  to  be  expected  -  was
    consistent with what was said by the Supreme Court in KO [2018] UKSC 60
    about the need for the Rules to be straightforward and for the  court's
    area of discretion to be reduced rather  than  widened.   Mr  Mackenzie
    argued that the Rules are found to have explicitly reduced rather  than
    widened the considerations and have, it was said, led to the conclusion
    that it is not necessary in any given case to delve  into  exactly  how
    far the effect of deportation goes beyond the norm:  To do so would  be
    contrary to the principle identified in KO.  Mr Mackenzie  argued  that
    it was clear from the cases cited  that  emotional,  psychological  and
    developmental damage properly evidenced by medical and/or  social  work
    professionals may suffice to show the threshold is met.

16.  Having considered this matter and the extent to which there plainly  is
    a discretion and judgment to be made, I concluded in the light  of  the
    social worker's report that the removal of  the  Appellant  would  mean
    that the children would suffer significant  detriment  to  their  well-
    being, development and educational  processes  from  his  absence.  His
    partner's difficulties as a  single  parent  would  not  help  in  that
    matter, and nor would she be able to  essentially  compensate  for  his
    absence.

17.  In the  circumstances  I  conclude,  helped  as  I  have  been  by  the
    independent social worker's assessment who had,  as  the  report  makes
    plain, a full opportunity to consider this matter,  the  evidence  upon
    which having seen the children  and  considered  the  issues  with  her
    professional eye, that the conclusion was justified as a result of  her
    observations of the strong parental child bond between the children and
    their mother and father, and the extent of their respective involvement
    in the emotional support and physical  comfort  of  the  children.   Ms
    Harris concluded as follows (AB48, page 24/41 of the report):-

         "Both Jamal and Aleena are having their basic physical,  emotional,
         educational and health needs met and no concerns were identified in
         relation to the Welfare Checklist ... In my view, if  their  father
         is removed to Nigeria both children are likely to experience  grief
         and loss ... including associated feelings and behaviours  such  as
         anger, self-blame and extreme sadness,  leading  to  lowered  self-
         esteem  and  self-confidence,  reducing  overall   wellbeing.    In
         addition, the physical barriers caused by  location  would  prevent
         physical contact with their  father  for  the  foreseeable  future.
         Losing access to their primary carer is likely to cause  disruption
         to the children's routine and stability which may impact  on  their
         educational progress and development.

         Both children are currently able to  meet  the  Five  Outcomes  for
         Children and  Young  People  identified  in  Every  Child  Matters.
         However if Mr [O] is deported to Nigeria they will be disadvantaged
         by his inability to provide the same level of emotional,  practical
         and educational support.  He would also be unable  to  support  his
         children to participate in  religious  and  social  activities  and
         events.

         Additionally, both Jamal and Aleena currently relate to  themselves
         as children with two accessible parents and it  is  reasonable  for
         them to expect this to continue.   Mr  [O]'s  removal  may  have  a
         detrimental impact on their continuing positive identity  formation
         as British Citizens causing a reduction in  their  self-esteem  and
         self-confidence."

    Ms Harris confirmed the extent to which the Appellant and  his  partner
    currently provide stability, order and routine, and that if deported to
    Nigeria he was likely to suffer from the unwanted separation.

18.  Whilst Ms  Harris  couched  her  remarks  in  terms  of  "may"  have  a
    detrimental effect, it seemed to me in the light of the  experience  of
    when he was imprisoned that there was a greater likelihood that it will
    have that detrimental effect: Inevitably so with the  break-up  of  the
    close  family  relationship  (my  emphasis).   In  the   circumstances,
    therefore, I concluded on all the evidence, including the  photographic
    evidence, that the impact of removal would be unduly harsh  within  the
    terms of Exception 2 to Section 117C and in the  context  similarly  of
    the Immigration Rules and the provisions in paragraphs 398, 399.

19.  I concluded Article 8 ECHR family/private life rights were engaged  and
    the Respondent's decision was a significant interference. I  found  the
    Respondent's decision was lawful and served Article 8(2) ECHR purposes.
     I concluded, based upon the findings that were made by the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge, that this was a case where the likely consequences were
    such that it was unduly harsh for the Appellant  to  be  deported.   In
    reaching  that  view  I  have  attached  considerable  weight  to   the
    seriousness  of  the  offence  which  wholly  justified  an   immediate
    custodial sentence in  terms  of  the  risk  to  the  public  interest,
    firefighters, local  residents  and  others  who  are  affected  by  an
    arsonist's criminality.  However,  I  do  not  hold  that  against  the
    children but I took into account  the  more  serious  the  offence  the
    greater was the public interest in deportation and that Parliament  has
    produced the Exceptions which plainly, if engaged, as I find one to be,
    demonstrated that the Respondent's decision was disproportionate

NOTICE OF DECISION
