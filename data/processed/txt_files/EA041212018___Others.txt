For the Appellants:    Ms L [P] in person
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Senior Home Officer Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellants, who are mother and her two children, appeal against the
    decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Monaghan promulgated on 8 October
    2018,  in  which  the  Appellants'  appeals  against  the  Respondent's
    decision on their applications for permanent  residence  dated  30  May
    2018 were dismissed.

 2. The Appellants are citizens of Romania who applied  for  EEA  Residence
    Cards in recognition of a right of  permanent  residence  on  30  April
    2018.  The Respondent refused the applications on the basis that  there
    was inadequate evidence to show that they were qualified persons in the
    United Kingdom for a continuous five year period.  The  appeal  against
    the refusal was determined on  the  papers  and  permission  to  appeal
    against it granted on the basis that it was arguable  that  the  First-
    tier  Tribunal  had  erred  in  law  in  concluding  that   there   was
    insufficient evidence  that  the  First  Appellant  had  established  a
    continuous  five-year  period  of  residence  as  a  qualified  person.
    Specifically, it was arguable that the JSA letter dated  8  April  2013
    and the P45 dated 24 May 2013 were not  considered  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal and the outcome of the appeal may have been different if  they
    had been considered.

The appeal

 3. The Appellants appeal on the broad basis that sufficient  evidence  was
    provided to the First-tier Tribunal to establish the First  Appellant's
    continuous five-year residence in the United  Kingdom  as  a  qualified
    person.  The First Appellant asserts that she has been  in  the  United
    Kingdom from 2009 to the present date and has been  employed  or  self-
    employed from 2 February 2010 to the  present  date.   The  grounds  of
    appeal did not specifically  identify  the  evidence  relied  upon  nor
    directly address the gaps identified by the First-tier Tribunal.

 4. Neither the decision of the First-tier Tribunal, the grounds of appeal,
    nor the oral submissions before me dealt separately with the  decisions
    in relation to the Second and Third Appellants, both of whom are minors
    and whose applications appear to be entirely reliant upon  the  outcome
    of the First Appellant's application and appeal.

Findings and reasons

 5. The First-tier Tribunal Judge found that the  First  Appellant  started
    work on 9 February 2010 with the [M] Hotel and  worked  there  until  9
    November 2011. He was also satisfied that she worked  from  9  February
    2012 to 24 May 2013 for a care home called  [N].  He  found  there  was
    evidence that  the  First  Appellant  had  given  birth  to  the  Third
    Appellant on 19 February 2011 in the UK,  but  had  failed  to  provide
    evidence of maternity leave with her third child, who was born in 2015.
    There was evidence that the First Appellant then  became  self-employed
    in August 2016.

 6. The findings of the First-tier Tribunal are that in the period 2010  to
    2018 there were significant gaps in the evidence to show that the First
    Appellant had been exercising treaty rights as a  qualified  person  in
    the United  Kingdom.   First,  there  was  no  evidence  of  the  First
    Appellant being a work seeker between November 2011 and February  2012;
    secondly, there was no evidence of what she did between  May  2013  and
    August 2016. The conclusion  was  that  she  needed  to  make  a  fresh
    application with a complete chain of evidence.

 7. The following evidence was submitted but not given weight by the First-
    tier Tribunal: a P45 that the First Appellant left work on 1 May  2013;
    a letter to  the  First  Appellant  saying  she  was  not  entitled  to
    jobseekers   allowance   due   to   insufficient   national   insurance
    contributions  in  March/April  2013;  a  national   insurance   letter
    indicating   that   class   2   (self-employed)   national    insurance
    contributions were made for the year April 2014 to April 2015;  a  copy
    of the tax return for the year April 2014 to April 2015 which indicates
    that the First Appellant worked  cleaning  houses  on  a  self-employed
    basis from April 2014  to  April  2015;  maternity  allowance  decision
    documents from the Department of Work and Pensions  showing  the  First
    Appellant was in receipt of maternity allowance from 1 October 2015  to
    29 June 2016; a tax return for April 2015 to April 2016 indicating self-
    employed work by the First Appellant cleaning houses from October  2015
    to February 2017; a tax calculation letter for the tax year April  2016
    to  April  2017  indicating  self-employed  work  cleaning  and   doing
    hairdressing for which no tax was due.

 8. I find in accordance with the decision of the European Court of Justice
    in  Saint  Prix  v  SSWP  C-507/12  that  any  gap  between  the  First
    Appellant's employment with [M] Hotel and [N] care home is  covered  by
    the fact that she had given birth in February 2011 as she  clearly  was
    working prior and after the birth of the Third Appellant, and then  had
    a break but resumed work within a year of the birth with the  [N]  care
    home. As a result, she has continuous  employment  from  February  2010
    until May 2013.

 9. I find further that there is evidence  of  self-employment  from  April
    2014 to April 2017, including evidence  of  maternity  allowance  being
    received from October 2015 to June 2016 after the birth  of  the  First
    Appellant's third child.

10. However, there remains a gap in  the  evidence  of  being  a  qualified
    person from May 2013 to April 2014.  The First  Appellant  states  that
    she was a jobseeker during this period but  there  is  no  evidence  of
    seeking employment during this time and the JSA letter from March/April
    2013 predates this period.  There is some  evidence  showing  that  the
    First Appellant was studying at the Isle of Wight college for at  least
    part of this period, but it is  accepted  by  her  that  there  was  no
    evidence of having comprehensive  sickness  insurance  as  required  by
    regulation 6 of the Immigration (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations
    2016.  As a  result,  there  is  insufficient  evidence  of  the  First
    Appellant exercising treaty  rights/being  a  qualified  person  for  a
    continuous period of 5 years prior to the date of decision, there being
    a gap between May 2013 and April 2014.

11. In the circumstances, although the First-tier Tribunal failed take into
    account all of the  material  evidence  before  it  on  behalf  of  the
    Appellants; even taking that evidence at its highest,  the  failure  is
    not a material error of law because it does not in any event show  that
    the requirements of Regulation 15(1)(a) of  the  Immigration  (European
    Economic Area) Regulations 2016 are met.  The appeal must therefore  be
    dismissed on the basis that there  was  no  error  of  law  capable  of
    affecting the outcome of the appeals.

Notice of Decision

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve  the
making of a material error of law.  As such  it  is  not  necessary  to  set
aside the decision.

The decision to dismiss the appeals is therefore confirmed.

No anonymity directions are made.
