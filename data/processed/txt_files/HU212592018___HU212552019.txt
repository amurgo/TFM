Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Z Jafferji, Counsel instructed by Eurasia Legal
                    Services (Birmingham)
For the Respondent:    Mrs H Aboni, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DECISION AND REASONS (R)

   1. The appellants are both nationals of Bangladesh.  The first appellant
      is the husband of Lili Akther.  The second appellant is their son. The
      second appellant was born on 1st July 2000.   Lili Akther was issued
      with a Certificate of entitlement to a Right of Abode in the UK and
      she arrived in the UK on 10th May 2017.  On 24th June 2018 the
      appellants applied for entry clearance to the UK. Both applications
      were refused by the respondent for reasons set out in two separate
      decisions dated 14th September 2018.  The appellants' appeals against
      those decisions were dismissed by First-tier Tribunal Judge Kemp MBE
      for reasons set out in a decision promulgated on 3rd September 2019.


   2. For reasons set out in my error of law decision promulgated on 4th
      November 2020, I found the decision of Judge Kemp is vitiated by
      material errors of law and must be set aside.  Although I was urged by
      the parties to remit the appeal for rehearing before the First-tier
      Tribunal, I noted in my error of law decision that no application had
      been made by the appellants in accordance with Rule 15(2A) of the
      Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 and in view of the
      narrow issues that remain to be determined, I directed that the appeal
      be listed for a resumed hearing for the Upper Tribunal to remake the
      decision.


   3. The matter was listed for a resumed hearing before me on 5th January
      2021.  The hearing before me again took the form of a remote hearing
      using Skype for Business. Neither party objected.  Neither the
      appellants, who are both in Bangladesh, nor their sponsor joined the
      hearing remotely.  Mr Shuhag Uddin, a relative of the appellants and
      sponsor joined the hearing remotely.  He had been called by the
      appellants as a witness before the First-tier Tribunal.  I sat at the
      Birmingham Civil Justice Centre. I was addressed by the
      representatives in exactly the same way as I would have been if the
      parties had attended the hearing together.  As before, I was satisfied
      that it was in the interests of justice and in accordance with the
      overriding objective to proceed with a remote hearing because of the
      present need to take precautions against the spread of Covid-19, and
      to avoid delay.   At the end of the hearing I was satisfied that both
      parties had been able to participate fully in the proceedings.





The background


   4. As I have set out in my 'error of law' decision, the application made
      by the first appellant was refused because the respondent was not
      satisfied that the first appellant meets the eligibility relationship
      requirement, the eligibility financial requirement and the eligibility
      English language requirement set out in Appendix FM of the Immigration
      Rules.  The application made by the second appellant was refused
      because the respondent was not satisfied that the second appellant is
      related as claimed to the individuals named as his parents on a birth
      certificate relied upon by the second appellant. Neither was the
      respondent satisfied that the eligibility relationship requirements
      set out in section E-ECC.1.6 of Appendix FM are met by the second
      appellant. Additionally, the respondent was not satisfied that the
      second appellant meets the eligibility financial requirement set out
      in Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.


   5. At the hearing of the appeal before the First-tier Tribunal, Judge
      Kemp heard evidence from the appellant's sponsor and two witnesses.
      He found the evidence to be credible and he was satisfied as to the
      genuineness of the claimed relationships between the sponsor and both
      appellants.  He found that the marriage between the first appellant
      and the sponsor is a subsisting one and the relationship requirements
      set out in paragraphs E-ECP.2.1 to E-ECP.2.10 are met by the first
      appellant.


   6. It was uncontroversial that the appellants were unable to meet the
      financial requirements set out in Appendix FM when the applications
      for entry clearance were made.  Judge Kemp considered the evidence
      adduced at the hearing of the appeal and was satisfied that the
      sponsor has demonstrated she is now able to meet the financial
      threshold set out under the immigration rules.


   7. The remaining requirement to be met by the first appellant for entry
      clearance was the English language requirement set out in paragraph E-
      ECP.4.1. of Appendix FM of the immigration Rules.  The first appellant
      claimed that he is exempt from the English language requirement
      because, at the date of application, he had a disability which
      prevents him from meeting the requirement. Alternatively, he claimed
      there are exceptional circumstances which prevent the first appellant
      from being able to meet the requirement prior to entry to the UK.


   8. For the reasons set out in my 'error of law' I concluded decision
      Judge Kemp erred in his consideration of whether:


        a. The first appellant has a disability which prevents him from
           meeting the English language requirement.


        b. The second appellant's mother has had and continues to have sole
           responsibility for the second appellant's upbringing.


        c. There are serious and compelling family or other considerations
           which make exclusion of the second appellant undesirable and
           suitable arrangements have been made for his care.


        d. There are exceptional circumstances which would render the
           refusal of entry clearance, or leave to enter, a breach of
           Article 8 ECHR, because such refusal would result in
           unjustifiably harsh consequences for the appellants or another
           family member whose Article 8 rights it is evident would be
           affected by a decision to refuse the application.


Re-making the decision


   9. The only ground of appeal available to the appellants pursuant to
      s84(2) of the 2002 Act is that the respondent's decision is unlawful
      under s6 of the Human Rights Act 1998.   The burden of proof is upon
      the appellants to show, on the balance of probabilities, that they
      have established a family and/or private life, and that the refusal of
      leave to enter would interfere with that right. It is then for the
      respondent to justify any interference caused. The respondent's
      decision must be in accordance with the law and must be a
      proportionate response in all the circumstances.


The issues


  10. At the outset of the hearing before me, Mrs Aboni confirmed that the
      respondent accepts that the appellants are related to the sponsor as
      claimed.  She also accepts that First-tier Tribunal Judge Kemp found
      that the financial requirements set out in the rules were met by the
      appellants at the date of the hearing.  Mr Jafferji confirmed that it
      is common ground that the financial requirements were not met at the
      time of the application.


  11. The parties agree that insofar as the requirements set out in the
      immigration rules are concerned, the only issue insofar as the first
      appellant is concerned is whether the English Language Requirement is
      met.  If the English Language requirement is met by the first
      appellant, the second appellant's case is straightforward, because the
      second appellant was under the age of 18 at the date of application
      and it must follow that the relationship requirements set out in
      Section E-ECC.1.6(a) is met.  However, if the English Language
      requirement is not met by the first appellant the Tribunal will need
      to consider whether the second appellant can satisfy the relationship
      requirements set out in Section E-ECC.1.6(b) and (c), or
      alternatively, can satisfy the requirements for indefinite leave to
      enter the UK set out in paragraph 297 of the Immigration rules.  If
      the requirements set out within those rules are not met, the Tribunal
      will have to consider whether there are exceptional circumstances
      which would render the refusal of entry clearance or leave to enter, a
      breach of Article 8 ECHR, because such refusal would result in
      unjustifiably harsh consequences for the appellants or their sponsor.


  12. As I set out in my error of law decision, there was no Notice provided
      by the appellants or their representatives under Rule 15(2A) of the
      Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 inviting the Tribunal
      to admit further evidence that was not before the First-tier Tribunal.
       After hearing submissions from the parties, I reserved my decision
      and informed the parties that my decision would follow in writing.
      This I now do.


The submissions


  13. Mr Jafferji relied upon a skeleton argument dated 5th January 2021.
      The first appellant relies upon the medical evidence from Professor
      Gopal Sankar Dey ("Professor Dey") and Dr Mesbah Uddin ("Dr Uddin") in
      support of his claim that he has a mental condition which prevents him
      from meeting the English language requirement.  The appellants submit
      the respondent has not filed any evidence in response, and there is no
      reasonable basis for rejecting the medical evidence relied upon by the
      first appellant.  The appellants submit the assessment of both doctors
      is very clear; the first appellant's condition means that he is not
      capable of studying for and passing an English language test due to
      problems with his memory. He has been advised to stay away from any
      activities that trigger stress and anxiety and in particular, to
      refrain from "any educational activities that might trigger the
      depression".  The second appellant relies upon Section E-ECC.1.6.(b)
      and (c) of Appendix FM and paragraph 297(i)(f) of the immigration
      rules, and submits that in all the circumstances, there are serious
      and compelling family or other considerations which make exclusion of
      the second appellant from the UK undesirable.  The appellants submit
      that if the requirements for entry clearance set out in the
      immigration rules are not met, there are exceptional circumstances
      which would render refusal of entry clearance, a breach of Article 8
      ECHR and result in unjustifiably harsh consequences for the appellants
      and their sponsor, who would be affected by the decision.


  14. Before me, Mr Jafferji referred to the letter relied upon by the first
      appellant from Professor Dey, a Professor of Psychiatry, that is to be
      found at page 149 of the appellant's bundle.  He confirms the first
      appellant has been a patient of his and under treatment since 1st
      November 2014. He confirms the first appellant is suffering from
      "Recurrent Major Depressive Disorder", and he refers to the medication
      prescribed.  He states:


         "I would like to say that this disorder has affected Mr Samsul
         Haque Salu's ability to remember or memories (sic). Activities and
         instructions substantially. His memory has deteriorated to a stage
         that he will not be able to pursue any course of study or sit any
         exam. However, his ability to perform physical routine is not
         adversely affected by the illness or due to the impact of his
         medications. The assessment revealed that he is often frustrated
         and at a time very confused. This diseased also affects his daily
         routine activities like, disturb sleeping, reduce self esteem, less
         of interest in enjoyment and social occasion.


         My Recommendations:


            . stay away from anything that triggers stress and anxiety.


            . Refrain from any educational activities that might trigger
              the depression.


            . Take current medication until further assessment.


            . Participate in regular activities, family engagements and
              conversation."


  15. Mr Jafferji confirmed that the letter encapsulates the medical
      evidence that is before the Tribunal and is supported by the other
      evidence before the Tribunal.  He drew my attention to the manuscript
      prescription that is to be found at page 150 of the appellants' bundle
      which confirms the medication prescribed and referred to by Professor
      Dey.  He also drew my attention to the letter from Dr Uddin, who is
      described as a 'Medicine Specialist' and 'Assistant Professor', dated
      5th May 2019 that is to be found at page 151 of the appellants'
      bundle.  Dr Uddin confirms that the first appellant "is a patient of
      recurrent major depressive disorder and he is treated by Professor Dr
      Gopal Sankar Dey..".  He states:


         "I would like to say that this disorder has affected Mr Samsul
         Haque Salu's ability to remember or memories (sic) activities and
         instructions substantially. His memory has deteriorated to a stage
         that he will not be able to pursue any course of study or sit any
         exam. However, his ability to perform physical routine is not
         adversely affected by the illness or due to the impact of his
         medications. The assessment revealed that he is often frustrated
         and at a time very confused. This diseased also affects his daily
         routine activities like, disturb sleeping, reduce self esteem, less
         of interest in enjoyment and social occasion."


  16. Mr Jafferji candidly accepts that the material part of the letter from
      Dr Uddin is a 'cut and paste' from Professor Dey, but he submits, that
      does not detract from the fact that he confirms the diagnosis made by
      Professor Dey and adopts it.  The diagnosis of recurrent major
      depressive disorder is also referred to in a discharge summary that is
      to be found at page 153 of the appellants' bundle and finally, is
      referred to again by Professor Dey in a letter dated 5th June 2019.
      In that letter Professor Dey states:


         "... Samsul Haque Salu attended in my surgery on Wednesday 5th of
         June 2019.  He was reassessed and still to be found suffering from
         Recurrent Major Depressive Disorder. At present he is taking the
         following medication to manage his illness...


         ...


         I also like to say that because of Major Depressive Disorder Mr
         Samuel Haque Salu's memory has been deteriorated and he is
         complying to take daily medicine but does not comply to performing
         day-to-day activities. I therefore would like to say that he is not
         able to pursue any course of study or sit any examination ..."


  17. Mr Jafferji accepts there was no evidence from the first appellant
      himself regarding his health and in particular, his inability to
      pursue any course of study or sit an examination.  The sponsor had
      addressed the matter at paragraphs [21] to [23] of her witness
      statement dated 18th July 2019.  She confirms that her husband has
      been suffering from recurrent major depressive disorder which has
      affected his ability to remember or memorise activities.  She states:


         "21. ... According to doctor report, is short and long-term memory
         has deteriorated to a stage that he will not be able to do any exam
         ...".


      She refers to the letters from the doctors to support the claim made.
       Mr Jafferji maintains the respondent has not filed any evidence
      challenging the medical evidence relied upon and Professor Dey is
      clearly an eminent Professor of Psychiatry.  His qualifications and
      experience to make the diagnosis is not challenged.  He submits there
      was plainly active management of the appellant's condition as is
      apparent from the letter written in June 2019 which notes a change in
      medication.  The report, albeit brief, was prepared by a specialist
      doctor who has been involved in the on-going care of the first
      appellant, to support an application for entry clearance and is
      therefore sufficient.


  18. Mr Jafferji submits that if the English language requirement is not
      met, there are exceptional circumstances which would render refusal of
      entry clearance a breach of Article 8.  The first appellant refers to
      the delay on the part of the respondent in permitting the sponsor to
      settle in the UK and his poor mental health, which, it is said, would
      clearly be adversely affected if he is not permitted to join his wife
      in the UK.  It is said that the inability of the second appellant to
      join them in the UK would also have an impact upon the first
      appellant's mental health.  Mr Jafferji submits that the result of
      refusing the first appellant's application, would inevitably be the
      inability of the family unit to unite in the United Kingdom, and will
      be disproportionate. He submits the family intended that the
      appellants would come to the UK together to be reunited with the
      sponsor.  The four remaining children of the first appellant and the
      sponsor will remain in Bangladesh until such time as they are able to
      meet the requirements of the rules.  The family intends to migrate to
      the UK as it is properly entitled to do so, following the sponsor
      having established a right of abode.  The family could not all join
      the sponsor in the UK together because of the significant minimum
      income requirement that would have to be met. The first appellant and
      sponsor therefore made the decision that the appellants would come to
      the UK first, and once they are established as a family, there is
      likely to be sufficient income so that the minimum income requirement
      can be met, and arrangements can be made for the remaining children to
      make applications for entry clearance.  Mr Jafferji submits that but
      for the significant delay in dealing with the sponsor's application
      for a right of abode, there would have been a longer period of time to
      ensure the requirements of the rules were met by the appellants.


  19. As for the second appellant, Mr Jafferji submits serious and
      compelling considerations, include the factors that I have already
      referred to above, but also that the second appellant would be left in
      Bangladesh on his won, because of his father's inability to pass the
      English Language test.  He submits that keeping the family together,
      in circumstances where the sponsor has established a right of abode is
      a compelling factor that weighs heavily in favour of this family.  The
      stated intention of the family is that they will migrate to the UK and
      there is a significant risk that once the other children are able to
      join their parents, the second appellant will be left alone in
      Bangladesh separated from his family.


  20. On behalf of the respondent, Mrs Aboni submits the first appellant has
      failed to establish that he is exempt from the English language
      requirement.  The medical evidence that is relied upon by the first
      appellant is lacking in detail.  She submits the initial letter from
      Professor Dey fails to identify how the diagnosis of 'Recurrent Major
      Depressive Disorder' was reached or to refer to any tests carried out
      to reach that diagnosis or identify any deterioration in the first
      appellant's mental health.  She submits the letter lacks any detail as
      to why the appellant cannot pursue any course of study or sit any
      exam, notwithstanding the diagnosis referred to.  Mrs Aboni submits
      the letter from Dr Uddin adds nothing and is simply a 'cut and paste'
      of what had been said by Professor Dey, without expressing an
      independent view, supported by reasons.  Mrs Aboni submits the letter
      from Professor Dey dated 5th June 2019 provides no additional
      information, and there is no further up-to-date evidence either
      regarding the health of the first appellant or the financial
      circumstances of the sponsor in the UK. The appellants could not meet
      the financial requirements as at the date of application, but the
      First-tier Tribunal Judge found that the income requirement was met at
      the time of the hearing.  However, there is no further evidence
      confirming the requirement is still met.


  21. As for the second appellant, Mrs Aboni submits that the evidence does
      not establish that there are serious and compelling family or other
      considerations which make exclusion of the second appellant from the
      UK undesirable. There is very little information about the family's
      connections to Bangladesh.  It is accepted by the appellants that the
      younger children of the first appellant and sponsor would remain in
      Bangladesh without their parents.  There must therefore be some family
      support available to them in Bangladesh, and the second appellant
      would not find himself alone in Bangladesh.  She submits family
      separation is not a sufficiently serious and compelling circumstance.
      It was the sponsor's choice to separate from her family and establish
      herself in the UK.  There will be family separation even if the
      appellants are permitted entry to the UK because there are young
      children of the family that would remain in Bangladesh for the time
      being at least, and quite possibly, in the long term.  There is, Mrs
      Aboni submits, nothing preventing the sponsor living with her family
      in Bangladesh.  The appellants cannot satisfy the requirements set out
      in the immigrations rules.  There are, she submits, no other
      exceptional circumstances and the decision to refuse entry clearance
      cannot be said to be disproportionate.


  22. In reply, Mr Jafferji submits that once it is accepted that the first
      appellant has a Recurrent Major Depressive Disorder, if follows that
      there is no reason to doubt the opinion set out in the letters from Dr
      Dey and Mr Uddin.  There is no requirement for an expert's report of
      the type often produced in other proceedings or appeals.  It simply
      has to be credible evidence.


  23. Mr Jafferji submits the s55 duty to have regard to the best interests
      of a child apply when considering the proportionally assessment, and
      there is a need to safeguard and promote the welfare of the child.
      Here, the future impact upon the second appellant and the family as a
      whole, will be significant because of the risk of the second appellant
      being left separated from his family in Bangladesh.  Mr Jafferji
      refers to paragraph [56] of the judgement of Underhill LJ, in HA
      (Iraq) v SSHD [202] EWCA Civ 1176 and submits that when considering
      whether refusal would result in unjustifiably harsh consequences for
      the second appellant (for the purposes of Section GEN.3.2.(2) of
      Appendix FM), there is no reason why "unjustifiably" harsh
      consequences may not occur quite commonly. Finally, he refers to the
      judgement of the Court of Appeal in ECO (Mumbai) v NH (India) [2007]
      EWCA Civ, in which Sedley LJ, said at [22] and [23].


         "22.  Ms Laing next relies on the decision of this court in Mahmood
         (ante) for the proposition that, at least if the content of Mr
         Halai's family life is reduced to his relationship with his mother,
         there was no insurmountable obstacle on the evidence before the
         adjudicator to its resumption in India, and therefore no
         interference with it by the refusal of leave to enter. The passage
         she relies on, which is in the judgment of Lord Phillips MR at
         �55(3), relates to the proportionality of interference under art.
         8(2). But if one were to transpose it to the question which arises
         under art. 8(1) of interference with family life, it seems to me in
         the present context unarguable that keeping a son from joining his
         mother is any the less a want of respect for family life because
         the mother could instead join the son. In many cases it may well be
         relevant to show that, because there is no insurmountable obstacle
         to it, it is proportionate under art. 8(2) to expect the family
         member to go abroad in order to join or remain with the applicant.
         But the question has always to be answered in terms of art 8 and
         its jurisprudence (see Husna Begum v ECO, Dhaka [2001] INLR 115 ,
         �21, per Pill LJ), and that in my view is what was done here by the
         adjudicator in relation to a fact situation which displayed few of
         the features familiar in removal cases.


         23.  If I am wrong about this and the adjudicator's decision that
         there was an interference with family life sufficient to engage
         art. 8(1) does not stand up in law, then I am in no doubt that the
         AIT's decision does. It is to be found at �31-32 (see above), and,
         while brief, makes it clear that this was a dependent son who had
         been living with and accommodated by his parents until they moved
         to the UK - the mother by right - in the expectation, or at least
         the hope, that he would be allowed to join them."


  24. Mr Jafferji submits the sponsor has a right of abode in the UK and
      that is a factor that weighs in favour of the appellants when
      considering whether the decision to refuse entry is in all the
      circumstances, disproportionate.


Discussion


  25. The appellants have appealed the respondent's decisions to refuse
      their application for entry clearance, under s82 of the Nationality,
      Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 on the ground that the decisions are
      unlawful under s6 of the Human Rights Act 1998.  The appellant's must
      satisfy me on the balance of probabilities that Article 8 ECHR is
      engaged. If I find that it is, the burden shifts to the respondent to
      establish that the decision is proportionate. Although the appellants'
      ability to satisfy the immigration rules is not the question to be
      determined, it is capable of being a weighty factor when deciding
      whether the refusal is proportionate to the legitimate aim of
      enforcing immigration control.  As set out by the Court of Appeal in
      TZ (Pakistan) [2018] EWCA Civ 1109, compliance with the immigration
      rules would usually mean that there is nothing on the Secretary of
      State's side of the scales to show that the refusal of the claim could
      be justified. At paragraphs [32] to [34], the Senior President of
      Tribunals confirmed that where a person meets the rules, the human
      rights appeal must succeed because 'considerable weight' must be given
      to the respondent's policy as set out in the rules.  Conversely, if
      the rules are not met, although not determinative, that is a factor
      which strengthens the weight to be attached to the public interest in
      maintaining immigration control.


  26. It is not suggested by Mrs Aboni that the appellants do not enjoy a
      family life with the sponsor.  First-tier Tribunal Judge Kemp heard
      evidence from the appellant's sponsor and two witnesses.  He was
      satisfied as to the genuineness of the claimed relationships between
      the sponsor and both appellants.  He found that the marriage between
      the first appellant and the sponsor is a subsisting one and the
      relationship requirements set out in paragraphs E-ECP.2.1 to E-
      ECP.2.10 are met by the first appellant.  He found the second
      appellant is the son of the first appellant and the sponsor.


  27. The appellants and the sponsor lived together in Bangladesh prior to
      the sponsor's arrival in the UK in May 2017.  I find the appellants
      enjoy a family life with each other and the sponsor and Article 8 is
      plainly engaged.  I find that the decision to refuse the appellants
      leave to enter has consequences of such gravity as to engage the
      operation of Article 8.  I accept that the interference is in
      accordance with the law, and that the interference is necessary to
      protect the legitimate aim of immigration control and the economic
      well-being of the country.  The issue in this appeal, as is often the
      case, is whether the interference is proportionate to the legitimate
      public end sought to be achieved.  The importance of, and weight to be
      given to immigration control has been underscored by Parliament in
      s117 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (as amended).


  28. In reaching my decision I have had regard to the evidence relied upon
      by the appellants that is to be found in the appellant's bundle
      comprising of some 189 pages, together with the letter from Professor
      Dey dated 5th June 2019 that my attention was drawn to. I have had
      regard to the evidence whether it is expressly referred to in this
      decision or not.


  29. I have considered whether the requirements set out in the immigration
      rules are met by the appellants and having done so, I have reached my
      final conclusion by having regard to the appellants protected rights
      considered individually and collectively with the rights of each other
      and of the sponsor. In reaching my decision, I have throughout had
      regard to the best interests of the second appellant as a primary
      consideration.


The immigration rules and the first appellant


  30. It is useful to begin by considering whether the first appellant is
      able to satisfy the English language requirement set out in Section E-
      ECP.4.2 of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules:


         E-ECP.4.2. The applicant is exempt from the English language
         requirement if at the date of application-


             (a) the applicant is aged 65 or over;


             (b) the applicant has a disability (physical or mental
             condition) which prevents the applicant from meeting the
             requirement; or


             (c) there are exceptional circumstances which prevent the
             applicant from being able to meet the requirement prior to
             entry to the UK.


  31. The first appellant is not over the age of 65 and for reasons I gave
      in my error of law decision, the first appellant is unable to
      establish that there are exceptional circumstances which prevent him
      from being able to meet the requirement prior to entry to the UK. The
      issue for me is whether the evidence relied upon, establishes, on
      balance, that the first appellant has a disability (physical or mental
      condition) which prevents him from meeting the requirement.


  32. In her witness statement dated 8th July 2019 and her statutory
      declaration dated 23rd July 2018, Lili Akther confirms that her
      husband has been suffering from recurrent major depressive disorder
      which has affected his ability to remember or memorise activities. She
      provides no further information but simply refers to the medical
      evidence.  I have considered whether and to what extent the letters
      before me from Professor Dey and Dr Uddin support his claim that he
      has a disability (physical or mental condition) which prevents him
      from meeting the English language requirement.


  33. I am prepared to accept that Professor Dey is a Professor practising
      as a Psychiatrist at the Sylhet MAG Osmani Medical College and
      Hospital since 1992 and has the knowledge or experience to express a
      professional opinion.  Dr Uddin does not set out his qualifications or
      experience, but I am prepared to accept that he is a 'Medicine
      Specialist' and 'Assistant Professor' and he too, is employed by the
      Sylhet MAG Osmani Medical College and Hospital.  However, having
      considered the letters written by them, I attach little weight to the
      opinions expressed.


  34. The letter from Professor Dey dated 19th June 2018 confirms the first
      appellant has been a patient of his and has been receiving treatment
      since November 2014.  The letter does not provide any detail regarding
      the treatment that has been received by the appellant since November
      2014. He goes on to say that "After so many test I identified that he
      is suffering from Recurrent Major Depressive Disorder", but does not
      identify the background to any symptoms, the tests that were
      completed, when those tests were completed, or when the diagnosis of
      Recurrent Major Depressive Disorder was made.  Professor Dey does not
      identify the events or factors leading to the onset of the Recurrent
      Major Depressive Disorder that has been diagnosed and neither does he
      refer to any symptom or diagnostic criteria that he has adopted, in
      making the diagnosis.  Similarly, although he confirms in his most
      recent letter that the appellant has been prescribed medication and
      complies with taking medication, he claims the first appellant "does
      not comply to performing day-to-day activities" and that the first
      appellant "..is not able to pursue any course of study or sit any
      examination...", without any further elaboration or explanation.  He
      does not set out the day-to-day activities that the first appellant is
      not performing, or the reasons for that.  Furthermore, he does not
      outline whether any other treatment has been considered such as
      psychotherapy or other lifestyle adjustments that could help ease the
      first appellant's symptoms.  Without any further historical
      background, clinical information,  information as to the symptoms
      described by the appellant or the tests undertaken to reach the
      diagnosis, it is difficult to understand how Professor Dey has reached
      his diagnosis, and more importantly, how the opinion expressed that
      the first appellant is not able to pursue any course of study or sit
      any examination, has been reached.


  35. I accept, as Mrs Aboni submits, the letter from Dr Uddin dated 5th May
      2019 adds little.  He simply confirms the first appellant is a patient
      of 'recurrent major depressive disorder and is treated by Professor
      Dey.  The second paragraph of his letter is plainly, as Mr Jafferji
      was bound to accept, a 'cut and paste' from the letter written by
      Professor Dey dated 19th June 2018.  Mr Jafferji submits Dr Uddin has
      adopted the diagnosis made by Professor Dey and adopted the opinion
      that the first appellant's memory has deteriorated to a stage in that
      he will not be able to pursue any course of study or sit an exam. The
      difficulty with that submission is that there is no indication in the
      letter that Dr Uddin, acting as an independent expert, agreed with
      Professor Dey, following his own review of the appellant's records or
      any independent examination completed by him.


  36. True it is that the evidence of Professor Dey and Dr Uddin had been
      obtained to support an application for entry clearance, but that does
      not mean that expert evidence relied upon should fall short of the
      overriding duty of a medical expert, like any other expert, to provide
      independent assistance to the decision maker, and on appeal, to a
      Court or Tribunal.  I acknowledge the First-tier Tribunal and the
      Upper Tribunal may admit evidence whether or not the evidence would be
      admissible in a civil trial, but even so, in the context of a medical
      report, the doctor's task is to assist the decision-maker determine
      the issue by bringing to bear his or her medical expertise, with an
      adequate explanation as to how any diagnosis has been reached and the
      reasons for the opinions expressed.


  37. In my judgement neither Professor Dey nor Dr Uddin provide a critical
      and objective analysis of the symptoms displayed by the first
      appellant or explain the factual premise upon which the medical
      diagnosis and any prognosis is based, how, and from where the
      information is derived.  As I have said before, the only other
      evidence regarding that issue before the Tribunal is what is said by
      Mrs Akther in her witness statement and statutory declaration, but her
      evidence on that issue is extremely limited and she relies upon the
      letter from Professor Dey in particular.  On balance, I find that on
      the evidence before the Tribunal the first appellant has failed to
      establish he has a disability (physical or mental condition) which
      prevents him from meeting the English language requirement.


The immigration rules and the second appellant


  38. It is useful to set out the relevant immigration rules relied upon by
      the second appellant.  The requirements to be met for entry clearance
      as a child are set out in Section EC-: Entry clearance as a child, of
      Appendix FM.  Insofar as is material the Relationship requirements
      require:


         E-ECC.1.6. One of the applicant's parents must be in the UK with
         limited leave to enter or remain, or be being granted, or have been
         granted, entry clearance, as a partner or a parent under this
         Appendix (referred to in this section as the "applicant's parent"),
         and


             (a) the applicant's parent's partner under Appendix FM is also
             a parent of the applicant; or


             (b) the applicant's parent has had and continues to have sole
             responsibility for the child's upbringing; or


             (c) there are serious and compelling family or other
             considerations which make exclusion of the child undesirable
             and suitable arrangements have been made for the child's care


  39. Alternatively, the second appellant relies upon paragraph 297 of the
      immigration rules:


         Requirements for indefinite leave to enter the United Kingdom as
         the child of a parent, parents or a relative present and settled or
         being admitted for settlement in the United Kingdom


         The requirements to be met by a person seeking indefinite leave to
         enter the United Kingdom as the child of a parent, parents or a
         relative present and settled or being admitted for settlement in
         the United Kingdom are that he:


         (i) is seeking leave to enter to accompany or join a parent,
         parents or a relative in one of the following circumstances:


          ...


          (f) one parent or a relative is present and settled in the United
          Kingdom or being admitted on the same occasion for settlement and
          there are serious and compelling family or other considerations
          which make exclusion of the child undesirable and suitable
          arrangements have been made for the child's care: and


          ...


  40. It is uncontroversial that the second appellant's mother is in the UK.
       The second appellant currently lives in Bangladesh with his father
      and his four siblings.  Although Mr Jafferji refers to Section E-
      ECC.1.6.(b), there is not a shred of evidence before the Tribunal that
      even begins to support a claim that the second appellant's mother has
      had, and continues to have, sole responsibility for the second
      appellant's upbringing.  She does not make such a claim in her witness
      statement or statutory declaration.  In fact her evidence is that the
      family lived together happily in Bangladesh prior to her arrival UK
      and their intention is to live together in the UK. For the avoidance
      of any doubt I find that the second appellant has not established that
      his mother has had and continues to have sole responsibility for his
      upbringing.


  41. I must therefore consider whether there are serious and compelling
      family or other considerations which make exclusion of the child
      undesirable and suitable arrangements have been made for the child's
      care.  The issue is the same regardless of whether it is considered
      under the prism of Section E-ECC.1.6.(c) of Appendix FM or paragraph
      297(i)(f) of the immigration rules.


  42. In Mundeba (s55 and para 297(i)(f)) [2013] UKUT 00088 (IAC), the Upper
      Tribunal confirmed that the exercise of the duty by the Entry
      Clearance Officer to assess an application under the Immigration Rules
      as to whether there are family or other considerations making the
      child's exclusion undesirable inevitably involves an assessment of
      what the child's welfare and best interests require. It said:


         "34. In our view, 'serious' means that there needs to be more than
         the parties simply desiring a state of affairs to obtain.
         'Compelling' in the context of paragraph 297(i)(f) indicates that
         considerations that are persuasive and powerful. 'Serious' read
         with 'compelling' together indicate that the family or other
         considerations render the exclusion of the child from the United
         Kingdom undesirable. The analysis is one of degree and kind.  Such
         an interpretation sets a high threshold that excludes cases where,
         without more, it is simply the wish of parties to be together
         however natural that ambition that may be.


         ...


         37. Family considerations require an evaluation of the child's
         welfare including emotional needs. 'Other considerations' come into
         play where there are other aspects of a child's life that are
         serious and compelling - for example where an applicant is living
         in an unacceptable social and economic environment. The focus needs
         to be on the circumstances of the child in the light of his or her
         age, social background and developmental history and will involve
         inquiry as to whether:-


              i) there is evidence of neglect or abuse;


             ii) there are unmet needs that should be catered for;


            iii) there are stable arrangements for the child's physical
                 care.


         The assessment involves consideration as to whether the combination
         of circumstances sufficiently serious and compelling to require
         admission.


         38. As a starting point the best interests of a child are usually
         best served by being with both or at least one of their parents.
         Continuity of residence is another factor; change in the place of
         residence where a child has grown up for a number of years when
         socially aware is important: see also SG (child of a polygamous
         marriage) Nepal [2012] UKUT 265 (IAC); [2012] Imm AR 939."


  43. Even though the second appellant was a minor, albeit just shy of his
      18th birthday, when he made his application for entry clearance in
      June 2018, there is no evidence before the Tribunal from the second
      appellant identifying the serious and compelling family or other
      considerations which make his exclusion undesirable.  In her witness
      statement, Mrs Akther confirms that the second appellant is the eldest
      of her children and is studying in Bangladesh. She has exhibited
      letters from the Itauri Hazi Younus Miah Memorial High School, and
      Jamia Qasimul Uloom Kakordia Shewla Doksinvag Mewa to confirm the
      appellant has attended as a student and passed annual examinations. He
      has plainly been properly cared for and has been able to continue his
      education after his mother left Bangladesh.  Although Mr Jafferji
      submits the overall circumstances here are such that there are serious
      and compelling family or other considerations which make exclusion of
      the second appellant undesirable, that broad submission is not
      supported by any evidence regarding the second appellant's
      circumstances in Bangladesh.  I have no evidence before me as to what
      he is now doing, and why he could not continue his education and/or
      any employment in Bangladesh.  He has the support of his father at
      present, and on the evidence before me, I reject the claim that he
      would be left alone in Bangladesh if his father and/or his siblings
      left Bangladesh. He is the eldest child of the first appellant and
      sponsor, and his four siblings were to remain in Bangladesh if the
      appellants had secured entry clearance. That would only be possible if
      suitable arrangements were in place for the care of the second
      appellant's siblings, all of whom are younger than the second
      appellant.  On balance, I am quite satisfied that there is a support
      network available to the family in Bangladesh, whether familial or
      otherwise, that the second appellant could turn to and would continue
      to benefit from.


  44. On the evidence before me there is nothing to suggest that the first
      appellant has not played an active role in the upbringing of the
      second appellant or been unable to support the second appellant
      following his mother's move to the UK.  The second appellant has lived
      in Bangladesh throughout and the first appellant has, I find, been
      providing perfectly proper and adequate care for the second appellant
      for a lengthy period.  Although the letters before me from Professor
      Dey and Dr Uddin refer to the first appellant suffering from recurrent
      major depressive disorder, they do not say that the first appellant's
      mental health adversely impacts on his ability to care for, and to
      provide support to his children.


  45. Looking at the evidence before me in the round, I find there is no
      evidence of neglect or abuse, there is no evidence of any unmet needs
      and I am quite satisfied that there are stable arrangements in place
      for the second appellant's care.  I find the second appellant does not
      the requirements set out in the relevant immigration rules that are
      relied upon.


Appendix FM GEN.3.2


  46. I have considered whether there are exceptional circumstances which
      would render refusal of entry clearance a breach of Article 8 because
      such refusal would result in unjustifiably harsh consequences for the
      appellant and the sponsor.  I accept the decision to refuse the first
      appellant entry clearance will undoubtedly have an impact upon his
      relationship with his partner.  Similarly, I accept that the decision
      to refuse the second appellant entry clearance will have an impact
      upon his relationship with his mother.  I do not have a statement from
      either appellant and in her witness statement, Mrs Lili Akhter
      confirms that following their marriage, the family lived together
      happily in Bangladesh until May 2017 when she came to the United
      Kingdom having established a right of abode. She confirms there are
      five children of the marriage and that she has maintained regular
      contact with her husband and children since her arrival in the UK. She
      had planned to travel to Bangladesh in May 2019 to visit her husband
      and children after her husband was admitted to hospital, but that
      visit was unable to proceed because her passport was valid for a
      period of less than six months. Separation of a married couple or of a
      parent and child caused by an inability by one of them to secure entry
      clearance is likely to be 'harsh', but in this context I am not
      satisfied that the refusal of entry clearance results in unjustifiably
      harsh consequences for the appellants and sponsor.  The first
      appellant remains in Bangladesh with the five children of the marriage
      and there is no evidence before the Tribunal regarding the family
      circumstances in Bangladesh.  The letter from Professor Dey that is
      relied upon by the first appellant states the first appellant has been
      a patient and receiving treatment since November 2014.  If that is
      correct, Mrs Akther moved to the United Kingdom knowing of the health
      of her husband.  The letters from Professor Dey and Dr Uddin do not
      say when the diagnosis of Recurrent Major Depressive Disorder was
      made, and do not suggest that the separation of the first appellant
      from his wife is having an adverse impact upon the mental health of
      the first appellant. There is quite simply scant evidence before the
      Tribunal regarding the impact of the separation of the appellants from
      the sponsor.


  47. I accept, as Mr Jafferji submits that the family intended that they
      will all, in the fulness of time, migrate to the UK but whilst that
      may have been their intention, they could not have any expectation
      that the appellants and the remaining four children would be granted
      entry clearance.  The only expectation they can have had is that each
      application made to the respondent would be considered upon the facts
      and circumstances as they are when an application is made and will be
      determined by reference to the relevant rules and legal framework in
      place at that particular time.


  48. In reaching my decision I have had regard to the best interests of the
      second appellant as a primary consideration.  He was just shy of his
      eighteenth birthday when the application for entry clearance was made
      but is now over the age of eighteen.  As a starting point, I readily
      accept that the best interests of a child are usually best served by
      being with both or at least one of their parents. The second appellant
      lived with both his parents until May 2017, and since then, he has
      continued to live with his father.  The family dynamics changed when
      his mother moved to the UK having established a right of abode.  He
      has lived in Bangladesh all his life and I am quite satisfied that he
      is familiar with the culture and traditions in Bangladesh.  A move to
      the United Kingdom would enable him to reunite with his mother, but
      that would mean a change in the place of residence where he has grown
      up.  Importantly, in my judgement, it would also result in separation
      from his father and his siblings, who at least at present, will remain
      in Bangladesh.   The second appellant's reliance upon his mother is
      not as great as it would have been when she left Bangladesh in 2017.
      There is no evidence before me of any adverse impact upon the second
      appellant.  It is generally in the interests of children to have both
      stability and continuity of social and educational provision and the
      benefit of growing up in the cultural norms of the society to which
      they belong. The assessment of what is in the best interests of a
      child is inherently fact sensitive and I must carry out the assessment
      on the evidence before me. In the end, it is in my judgement in the
      best interests of the second appellant to remain with his father and
      siblings in Bangladesh.


  49. I have carefully considered whether the decision to refuse the
      appellants entry clearance is nevertheless disproportionate.  The
      ultimate issue is whether a fair balance has been struck between the
      individual and public interest.  In carrying out the balancing
      exercise, I have had regard to the delay in permitting the sponsor to
      settle in the UK. She applied for a right of abode on 14th October
      2014.  The application was refused but an appeal was allowed on 15th
      April 2016.  She was granted entry clearance on 27th March 2017.
      Although there was plainly some unexplained delay, that delay has not
      impacted upon the appellants per se.  The sponsor arrived in the UK in
      May 2017.  The appellants applied for entry clearance some 13 months
      later in June 2018.  As Mrs Akhter accepts in paragraph [8] of her
      witness statement, there was some delay because she was unable to meet
      the minimum income requirement to sponsor the appellants. She confirms
      that she took all steps to sponsor them as soon as she had managed to
      get an appropriate job with the required salary and third-party
      support.  The claim in the following paragraph that if she had been
      allowed to come to the UK when she applied (i.e. in October 2014) she
      would have been able to meet the financial requirement in good time to
      sponsor the appellants before the second appellant attained the age of
      18, is nothing more than speculation.  I am not prepared to speculate
      as to what the position may have been at some earlier point.


  50. In reaching my decision, I have also had regard to the mental health
      of the first appellant, albeit the evidence before the Tribunal is in
      the vaguest of terms, and very limited.  Finally, I also note that
      absent the English language requirement, the first appellant would
      have qualified for entry clearance in light of the other findings made
      by First-tier Tribunal Judge Kemp.  Furthermore, it is likely that if
      the first appellant was able to meet the English language requirement,
      the second appellant would have succeeded.


  51. In my final analysis and in carrying out the balancing exercise, I
      have also had regard to the  respondent's policy as set out in the
      immigration rules.  The appellants are unable to satisfy the
      requirements of the immigration rules for the reasons I have set out.
      I have also had regard to the public interest considerations set out
      in s117B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 ("the
      2002 Act").  I acknowledge that the maintenance of immigration control
      is in the public interest.  The first appellant is unable to speak the
      English language.  I acknowledge that s117B(2) Act provides that it is
      in the public interest, and in particular in the interests of the
      economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that persons who seek to
      enter or remain in the United Kingdom are able to speak English
      because persons who can speak English - (a) are less of a burden on
      taxpayers, and (b) are better able to integrate into society.  I
      acknowledge that there is no English language requirement to be met
      for entry clearance as a child.  Although there is force in the
      submission made by Mrs Aboni that there is no up-to-date evidence
      before me regarding the financial circumstances of the sponsor so that
      I can be satisfied that the minimum income requirement is met, I
      acknowledge and accept that First-tier Tribunal Kemp found that the
      eligibility financial requirement was met at the time of his decision
      promulgated on 3rd September 2019.  Finally, as I have said before,
      the appellants remain in Bangladesh with the four other children of
      the marriage between the first appellant and sponsor and there is no
      evidence before the Tribunal regarding the appellants' circumstances
      in Bangladesh, the wider family in Bangladesh and the support that is
      available to them.


  52. Having considered all the evidence before me in the round, and
      although I have accepted that the refusal of entry clearance will
      interfere with the appellants' family life and the family life of
      their sponsor, in my judgement, the interference for the purposes of
      the maintenance of effective immigration control, is proportionate,
      and it follows, lawful.


Notice of Decision


  53. I dismiss the appeal is  on  the  basis  that  the  refusal  of  entry
      clearance does not breach section 6 Human Rights Act  1998  (based  on
      Article 8 ECHR)


  54. No anonymity direction was  made  by  the  FtT.   There  has  been  no
      application for an anonymity direction before me.
