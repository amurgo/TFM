For the Appellant:     In person
For the Respondent:    Mr T Lindsay, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant is a citizen of Poland.  In a decision sent on  27  April
    2017 Judge Kaler of the First-tier Tribunal dismissed  the  appellant's
    appeal against the decision made by the respondent on 30 December  2016
    refusing  to  issue  a  document,  certifying  permanent  residence  as
    confirmation of the appellant's right of  residence  in  the  UK.   The
    judge accepted that there was evidence  that  the  appellant  had  been
    economically active in the UK from October 2004  and  had  had  several
    employers including Abacus Transport, NFT Transport, Monarch  Personnel
    and  GB Oils.  However, the judge does not appear to have accepted that
    these employments formed part of a pattern  of  continuous  employment.
    The judge only accepted that  the  appellant  was  economically  active
    between:

    4/10/2004 - 30/12/2005 (paragraph 20; 21)
    April 2006 - April 2007 (paragraph 23)
    9/11/2011 - 25/10/2012 (paragraph 15)
    14/12/2013 - 12/4/2013 (paragraph 16)
    17/5/2013 - 18/7/2013 (paragraph 17)

2.   The judge commenced his assessment at paragraph 24:

         "Thus far, I accept that the Appellant was economically  active  in
         the UK from 04/10/2004 to 30/12/2005.  I am satisfied that  he  was
         employed again for one year until 2007 with NFT distribution.   The
         Appellant has not provided a contract of  employment,  wage  slips,
         bank statements or tax documents that would establish he  has  been
         working  again  until  January  2011.   Thereafter,  it  has   been
         established that he was employed from January 2011  until  18  July
         2013.   The  evidence  does  not  point  to  the  Appellant   being
         economically active for a continuous period of 5 years  and  so  he
         does not qualify for a permanent residence card on the basis of his
         employment history."

3.   The judge then turned his attention to the appellant's  claim  that  he
    has been economically active as a self-employed person since 2013.   At
    paragraph 25 he concluded:

         "The Appellant claims to be self-employed.  He has not produced any
         accounts or business bank statements.  He may  have  established  a
         company but the evidence of economic activity is woefully  lacking.
         I do not find that he has  established  he  has  been  economically
         active as a self-employed person since 2013."

4.   The appellant's grounds stated that the judge had  overlooked  evidence
    placed before him, stating that the appellant  had  set  up  a  limited
    company, Dromader Ltd, from 27 December 2013  until  7  November  2017.
    This evidence included a letter from the appellant's  accountants  RACS
    PSC, circa June 2017 stating that the appellant is the sole director of
    Dromader Ltd and then citing  figures  to  show  that  the  company  is
    solvent and continues to trade profitably.  There was also a number  of
    remittances to the appellant for driver support  services  at  numerous
    dates in 2015.

5.   At a hearing that took place before us on 28 September 2018 Mr  Lindsay
    for the respondent accepted that the judge had not taken account of the
    evidence relating to the appellant's self-employment but submitted that
    this error was not material because the appellant could still not  show
    that he had five years of continuous economic activity.   We  indicated
    that we were satisfied that the judge had  erred  in  failing  to  take
    account of the self-employment evidence and that this  was  a  material
    error because it could not be excluded that if the judge had taken into
    account this evidence, he  may  have  concluded  there  was  continuous
    economic activity for a five year period.

6.    Having  heard  submissions  we  gave  oral   directions   which   were
    subsequently confirmed  in  writing  on  29  September  2018  that  the
    appellant produce further evidence in support of his claim to have been
    self-employed as a sole trader from 27 December 2013 to 7 November 2017
    and that the respondent produce any further evidence by the same  date.



7.   In response to our directions the appellant  produced  an  HMRC  letter
    dated 1 November 2018 giving details of his employment from  2004/5  to
    2014/15 tax year, showing employment, tax and NI.

Our Decision

8.   As indicated at the hearing and explained above, we are satisfied  that
    the FtT Judge materially erred in law.

9.   In light of the further evidence now  available  to  us  following  our
    directions, we are satisfied that the appellant has established he  has
    completed five years  of  continuous  economic  activity  amounting  to
    exercise of Treaty rights.  In light of the further  evidence,  we  are
    able to find as follows:

    1)   In relation to the appellant's employment  history,  he  had  been
         employed in every tax year since 2004/5 until 2012/13.  In each  of
         these years the  amount  of  earnings  was  significant  and  taken
         cumulatively  they  demonstrate  that  the  appellant  has  had   a
         continuous  connection  with  the  labour  market.   Whatever  gaps
         between one employment  and  another,  they  were  not  significant
         enough to cause him to have ceased to have the status of  a  worker
         under the EEA Regulations.  That means he has  been  able  to  show
         five years'  continuous  employment  even  before  he  began  self-
         employment in 2013.


    2)   Even if the position  was  that  in  order  to  show  five  years'
         continuous economic activity the appellant had to show that he  had
         been self-employed since December 2013 - November  2017  (and  that
         there was no significant break until his last period of  employment
         and commencement of his self-employment), we are satisfied  he  has
         demonstrated that.


         First of all, the HMRC letter of 1 November  2018  states  that  in
         2013/14 he had earnings from two employments (Butlers Fuels Ltd and
         Certas Energy UK Limited) on which he paid tax and in  addition  he
         paid 41 self-employment  contributions.   In  2014/15  his  company
         Dromader Ltd is listed and  53  self-employment  contributions  are
         listed.  There is  also  an  earlier  letter  from  HMRC  dated  25
         September 2018 showing sources of income from Dromader Ltd for  tax
         years 2014/15, 2015/16 and 2016/17.


10.  In light of this further evidence, the appellant has  shown  continuous
    economic activity after December 2013 until the end of tax year 2016/17
    (there is also further evidence that in tax year 2017/18 he had sources
    of income from A Clarke & Co (Smethwick Ltd) and Dromader Ltd).  He has
    also shown that any gap between the last period of  employment  in  the
    tax year 2013/14 and the commencement  of  his  self-employment  cannot
    have been of such significance as to  break  his  connection  with  the
    labour market.


11.  Even if, therefore, the appellant needed to  establish  self-employment
    for  December  2013  onwards  in  order  to  demonstrate  five   years'
    continuous exercise of Treaty rights, we are satisfied he has done  so.



12.  Accordingly he has established to our  satisfaction  that  he  has  had
    more than five years' continuous economic activity first  as  a  worker
    and more recently  as  a  self-employed  person.   Accordingly,  he  is
    entitled to succeed in his appeal.


No anonymity direction is made.
