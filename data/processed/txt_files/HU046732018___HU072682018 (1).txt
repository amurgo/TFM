                            DECISION AND REASONS

      1. This is an appeal against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge
         Black ('the judge'), promulgated on 30 August 2018, dismissing  the
         appellants' appeals against the  respondent's  decision  to  refuse
         their claims for indefinite leave to remain.



Overview

      2. The appellants are citizens of India.  They  appealed  against  the
         decision of the respondent  to  refuse  them  indefinite  leave  to
         remain under paragraphs 322(5), 276B, 276ADE and Appendix FM of the
         Immigration Rules.

      3. Relevant to this onward appeal is the respondent's contention  that
         the first  appellant's  earnings,  as  declared  to  Her  Majesty's
         Revenue and  Customs  ('HMRC'),  differed  significantly  from  the
         income he had declared to the Home  Office  following  two  Tier  1
         leave to remain applications made in March 2011 and September  2013
         respectively.

      4. The respondent's case was that there had been a  clear  benefit  to
         the first appellant either by failing to declare his full  earnings
         in order to reduce his tax liability  and/or  falsely  representing
         his earnings to the Home Office to meet the points requirement  for
         a Tier 1 visa.

      5. This deception, it was advanced, meant it was undesirable to permit
         the first appellant to remain, and thereby the first appellant  did
         not meet the requirements of the long residence rules.

      6. The appellant accepted a mistake had been made and it  was  not  in
         dispute that the first appellant had declared  a  lower  income  to
         HMRC than he had to the respondent  in  his  two  leave  to  remain
         applications  (see  paragraphs   29   and   30   of   the   judge's
         determination).

      7. The central issue was  whether  the  first  appellant  had  made  a
         genuine mistake or had been deceitful. If the appellant's  case  of
         genuine mistake was accepted, he  and  his  wife  would  have  been
         entitled to indefinite leave to remain.

      8. Following a hearing, the judge found that there  had  been  deceit,
         and the appeal was dismissed.

      9. In the grounds of appeal to this  Upper  Tribunal,  drafted  on  30
         November 2018, those representing the  appellants'  submitted  that
         the judge had materially erred in dismissing these appeals because:



          1. The judge had made conflicting and contradictory findings,  in
             particular at paragraph 54  of  the  decision,  where  it  was
             stated the first  appellant  had  sought  copies  of  his  tax
             returns and it was only at that stage discrepancies  had  come
             to light - something the judge had accepted;

          2.  The judge had made irrational findings,  thereby  undermining
             the safety of the determination;

          3. There had been procedural  unfairness,  as  a  number  of  the
             findings made in the determination were not put to  the  first
             appellant, and as such the appellants had been deprived of  an
             opportunity to address any residual concerns the judge had.

     10. On 1  November  2018,  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Parkes  refused
         permission to appeal on the basis that the decision, when read as a
         whole, was clear and that Judge Black had taken the  view,  as  the
         judge was entitled  to  do,  that  the  first  appellant  had  been
         dishonest.

     11. The above decision was considered again  by  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
         Grubb on 22 January 2019. He concluded that there was  arguably  an
         error of law in relation to the judge's apparent acceptance of  the
         explanation in terms of when the discrepancy came to light and  the
         judge's final conclusion. He therefore granted permission to appeal
         on grounds 1. and 3., refusing permission in relation to ground 2.

     12. On 25 January 2019, Upper Tribunal Judge O'Connor  gave  directions
         in relation to the listing of this matter,  including  a  timetable
         for the service of evidence.

     13. It is against the above background  that  this  matter  was  listed
         before me.



Ground 1 - conflicting /contradictory findings

     14. The focus of this first appeal ground centres on  paragraph  54  of
         the judgement. The relevant paragraph reads as follows:

              '54.    The first appellant's evidence is that  he  had  been
             told by an immigration lawyer that his tax  affairs  would  be
             checked  in  connection  with  his  proposed  application  for
             indefinite leave to remain on the grounds of  long  residence.
             He says he then sought copies of his tax return from HMRC  and
             it was at that stage that the discrepancies came to  light.  I
             accept that.'

     15. The appellant's representative maintains this demonstrates that the
         judge  unequivocally  accepted  that  aspect  of  the   appellant's
         evidence and that 'it can only mean that it is accepted that he was
         not aware of the discrepancies until the tax returns  arrived  much
         later as part of the application process and, as such, he  did  not
         have the intention to mislead when  the  tax  return  was  actually
         filed'.

     16. The judge sets out the  first  appellant's  version  of  events  at
         paragraph 39:

             'He was asked in the questionnaire when and how he  discovered
             he had made an error in his tax return and  replied:  "in  the
             year 2016, I seek the advice of immigration lawyer  as  I  was
             preparing for my settlement application (sic.). I then came to
             know that I should be reviewing all my  income  records.  Upon
             requesting information from HMRC and records  of  my  previous
             earnings, I came to know that there was a discrepancy  in  the
             tax year 2012/13". He states that, on discovering  the  error,
             he contacted his accountant and asked him to review and inform
             HMRC  of  the  amended  records.  The  appellant  applied  for
             indefinite leave to remain on the grounds of long residence on
             18 August 2016'.

     17. The first appellant  said  the  reason  he  had  not  reviewed  and
         verified the information prior to its submission to HMRC  was  'due
         to changes within my  family  circumstances,  i.e.  my  father  was
         diagnosed with cirrhosis of  liver  in  May  2014....  Further,  my
         wife's pregnancy [in] early 2014 and the birth of my first child in
         November 2014 created additional responsibilities on me'.

     18. Importantly, in  this  regard,  the  judge  goes  on  to  state  at
         paragraph 41:

             "HMRC wrote to the first appellant on 10 November 2016 with  a
             notice of further assessment for the year ending April 2014. A
             copy of the letter was sent to  Gohil's  Accountancy  Services
             Limited. This letter refers  to  the  first  appellant  having
             notified that there was additional tax to pay  which  was  not
             previously declared. It was too late to amend his tax  return.
             The date of this letter is consistent with the first appellant
             having discovered the discrepancy in that year". [My  emphasis
             added.]

     19. Those representing the appellant make the point that  the  date  of
         the letter he subsequently received from HMRC was  consistent  with
         the first appellant discovering there had  been  a  discrepancy  in
         2016 and therefore it cannot be said he knew about the error on the
         tax return previously - meaning at the time  it  was  submitted  it
         came down to genuine mistake.

     20.  The  case  law  with  regard  to  declared  earnings  disputes  is
         summarised by the judge at paragraph 21 and  27  of  the  decision,
         wherein the cases of R (on the application of Khan) v Secretary  of
         State for the Home Department (Dishonesty,  tax  return,  paragraph
         322(5)) [2018] UKUT 384 (IAC) and Secretary of State for  the  Home
         Department v Shehzad and Chowdhury [2016] EWCA Civ 615  are  cited.
         Of particular relevance is paragraph  32  et  seq  of  Khan,  where
         Martin Spencer J held:

             "32. The starting point seems to me  to  be  that,  where  the
             Secretary of State discovers a significant difference  between
             the income claimed in a  previous  application  for  leave  to
             remain and the income declared  to  HMRC  (as  here),  she  is
             entitled to draw an inference  that  the  Applicant  has  been
             deceitful or dishonest and therefore he should be refused  ILR
             within paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules.  However, it
             does not follow that, in all such cases, a decision to  refuse
             ILR will be lawful.  Where an Applicant has presented evidence
             to show that, despite the prima facie inference, he was not in
             fact dishonest but only careless, then the Secretary of  State
             is presented with a fact-finding task which  must  be  carried
             out fairly and lawfully.  In that regard, she needs to  remind
             herself that a finding that a person has  been  deceitful  and
             dishonest in relation to his tax affairs with the  consequence
             he is denied settlement in this  country  is  a  very  serious
             finding with serious consequences and therefore  the  evidence
             must be cogent and strong although, as the  authorities  show,
             the  standard   of   proof   remains   on   the   balance   of
             probabilities."

     21. It is apparent in the instant matter that the judge  was  satisfied
         the respondent had demonstrated that on both occasions,  namely  in
         March  2011  and  September  2013,  his   claimed   earnings   were
         significantly in excess  of  those  declared  to  HMRC.  The  judge
         concluded that the respondent was entitled to take the view on  the
         evidence and on the balance of probabilities that either the  first
         appellant had  not  earned  the  income  claimed  or  that  he  had
         misrepresented his income in  order  to  demonstrate  that  he  was
         entitled to the award of points for an income within  the  required
         bracket. In other words, the prima facie inference of deception was
         made out.

     22. The judge then correctly  considered  whether  the  other  evidence
         available helped determine if the error  in  relation  to  the  tax
         return was dishonest or merely careless (per para 34 of Khan).

     23. It is important at this point to note the judge was considering two
         separate tax returns and two Tier  1  (General)  applications.  The
         request in 2016 deals with the tax year 2013/14. The judge observes
         at paragraph 43 that there was no specific  reference  to  the  tax
         return for the year ending 2010/11 having been  amended,  i.e.  the
         one that relates to the first appellant's income from dividends  as
         claimed in his March 2011 Tier 1 application.

     24. According to the judge, the  first  appellant  was  asked  why  the
         2010/11 tax return was incorrectly submitted and the appellant said
         he  had  not  thoroughly  verified  the  records  because  he   was
         undergoing changes in his family life, i.e.  his  father's  illness
         and wife's pregnancy. He maintained that he had  included  evidence
         about the amendments for 2010/11 when he submitted the amended  tax
         return. Nonetheless, the judge found that  there  was  no  specific
         reference to any amendments made to the  income  declared  to  HMRC
         with regard 2010/11.

     25. The judge concluded that the first  appellant  had  known  that  in
         order to remain in the UK as a Tier 1 general migrant,  he  had  to
         demonstrate he earned between �40,000 and �49,999 to be awarded the
         requisite number of points under the points-based scheme. The judge
         noted that  the  first  appellant  had  not  provided  in  the  tax
         questionnaire an adequate explanation for the  discrepancy  in  his
         claimed income for that first year, as against the income  declared
         to HMRC.

     26. The judge considers the credibility of the appellant's account  for
         the tax year 2010/11 at paragraph 48:

             "as regards the failure to declare his income  from  dividends
             for the tax year 2010/11 ... it is  unlikely  that  the  first
             appellant, who is an  intelligent  man  with  the  benefit  of
             professional accountancy advice from the outset of setting  up
             his company, did not appreciate he  had  to  pay  tax  on  his
             income from dividends.... I do not accept that simply  because
             he had instructed an accountant he did not  look  at  the  tax
             return before he signed and submitted it; indeed, he  told  me
             he would normally look at it.... It is not suggested that  the
             first appellant's personal circumstances were stressful at the
             time he set up the company and filed  through  his  accountant
             the tax return relating to his income in 2010/11 ..."

     27. The judge's approach in this regard reflects paragraph 33  of  Khan
         (supra):

             "33. It is further the case,  in  my  judgment,  that  for  an
             applicant simply to blame his or her accountant for an "error"
             in relation to the historical tax return will not be  the  end
             of the matter.  Thus, the Secretary of State  is  entitled  to
             take into account that even where an accountant  has  made  an
             error, the accountant will or should have asked  the  taxpayer
             to confirm that the return was accurate and to have signed the
             tax return, and furthermore the Applicant will have  known  of
             his or her earnings and will have expected to pay tax  thereon
             ..."

     28. The judge then went on to refer to the  fact  that  the  appellant,
         over a period of 8 years, had been working at a Co-operative  store
         as a duty manager. The store manager  refers  to  'high  levels  of
         intelligence and understanding' and that the  first  appellant  met
         'every challenge, deadline and goal presented'.  The  judge  states
         there was no mention of any stress or  any  other  difficulties  at
         work. His wife did not miscarry until early 2014, so that could not
         be an explanation for the error in  March  2011.  Neither,  on  the
         judge's finding, could  the  first  appellant's  father's  illness,
         diagnosed in May 2014, account for the omission.

     29. The judge accepts that the second Tier 1 declaration  for  the  tax
         year 2012/13 was probably filed in  2014  or  later,  and  that  in
         principle the  second  appellant's  miscarriage  and  his  father's
         illness and subsequent death might have  had  an  impact,  but  the
         judge adds: 'There is no evidence that this was actually the  case.
         The letter of support from the supervisor  at  the  Co-op  suggests
         otherwise. Nor is there evidence of other matters, other  than  his
         tax affairs being late or inappropriately drafted...'

     30. Notwithstanding the appellants representative's submission that the
         judge had unequivocally accepted the evidence  that  the  appellant
         was not aware of discrepancies until the tax returns  arrived  much
         later,  in  my  finding  such  an  assertion  is  not   made   out,
         particularly when this decision is read as a whole.

     31. For example, the  first  appellant's  explanation  for  failing  to
         declare all of his income one year was that  he  had  inadvertently
         failed to provide the relevant invoices to  his  accountant.  There
         were, he said, 20 missing invoices. The  judge  was  not  satisfied
         with that explanation: 'It is unlikely that,  having  kept  such  a
         record, neither he nor his accountant failed to identify that  some
         20  invoices  were  missing  and  had  not  been  provided  to  the
         accountant  for  the  preparation  of  tax  returns.  Had  such   a
         spreadsheet been provided, as the  first  appellant  says,  such  a
         discrepancy would have been immediately noted'.

     32. Further, the judge notes that while the first  appellant  maintains
         that he was working through his  own  limited  company  in  IT  and
         computers, the second appellant stated that  neither  she  nor  the
         first appellant were self-employed, but only referred  to  them  as
         working at McDonald's and in  the  Co-op  respectively.  The  judge
         concluded that was a significant discrepancy that went to the  crux
         of the appeal: 'I would expect the second appellant to know whether
         her  husband  was  self-employed  at  the  date   of   application,
         particularly if he had been running a company  since  2010,  as  he
         claims'.

     33. Paragraph 54 therefore cannot be  read  in  the  type  of  isolated
         vacuum that I was urged to consider. I do not read it to be  saying
         that the judge accepts that the errors made on the two tax  returns
         were innocent or unintentional, in the sense  of  being  a  genuine
         mistake. I think it means what it says:  that  in  2016  the  judge
         accepted that the appellant had been told by an immigration  lawyer
         that his tax affairs would be checked,  that  he  therefore  sought
         copies of those tax return from HMRC, 'and it  was  at  that  stage
         that the discrepancies came to light'.

     34. The judge was not saying that those discrepancies were innocent  or
         that the initial tax returns were a result of a genuine mistake. It
         is clear from what goes before that the judge did not  think  that.
         Rather than find inconsistency, that appears to me  to  be  a  more
         natural interpretation of the determination as a whole.

     35. I draw further support in that  conclusion  from  what  follows  at
         paragraph 54  et  seq:  the  judge  doubts  the  first  appellant's
         evidence about his son's first language;  expresses  a  reservation
         about who  was  actually  dealing  with  the  appellants  financial
         affairs, something the first appellant had claimed at one point  he
         did himself; and the judge was entitled  to  find  that  the  first
         appellant had not disclosed any correspondence with his  accountant
         regarding the events which led to the amendment of his tax returns,
         (albeit the judge gave  no  adverse  weight  to  the  lack  of  any
         explanation for the absence of such evidence, since it was not  put
         to him).

     36. Significantly, the judge found at  paragraph  59:  'Generally,  the
         first appellant's  oral  evidence  was  confused  and  muddled.  He
         frequently did  not  answer  straightforward  questions,  but  gave
         detailed, rambling and irrelevant responses. His oral evidence  was
         evasive, vague and confusing....'

     37. And at paragraph 60:

             "I find the appellants are not credible or reliable witnesses.
             They  have  fabricated  and  embellished  their  evidence   to
             demonstrate the first appellant has a reasonable  or  innocent
             explanation for the discrepancies in the figures  claimed  for
             his earnings and declared by way of  income.  I  am  satisfied
             that the first appellant did not earn the sums claimed to  the
             respondent in March 2011 and September 2013. The  fluctuations
             in the profit and loss accounts are sufficiently concerning as
             to suggest that the first appellant had inflated his  earnings
             to enable him to be awarded  points  as  a  Tier  1  (General)
             migrant. ... I am satisfied  the  first  appellant  sought  to
             deceive and did deceive the respondent in the two applications
             and that he had no entitlement to the award of points ... I am
             satisfied the first appellant knew he did not earn  sufficient
             income from his work for the Co-op and  that  he  set  up  the
             company as a means to demonstrate additional income... for the
             award of points as a Tier 1 migrant. ... I  am  satisfied  the
             first appellant acted dishonestly in claiming  in  March  2011
             and September 2013 ..."

     38. Any notion therefore that the  judge  intended  to  accept  without
         demure the first  appellant's  explanation  is  clearly  misplaced.
         Comments made by the judge in relation to the letter of  2016  make
         no difference to the overall outcome. No error of  law  can  in  my
         judgement be properly founded by taking an isolated  statement  out
         of context.

     39. I therefore agree with Ms Jones that the  interpretation  that  the
         appellant seeks to place on paragraph 54 is misconceived and  flies
         in the  face  of  what  is  otherwise  a  well-reasoned  and  clear
         judgement. I therefore dismiss ground 1.



Ground 3 - procedural unfairness

     40. The force of the second ground of appeal to be  granted  permission
         was that a number of the findings made in  the  determination  were
         not put to the first appellant and, as such, he was deprived of the
         opportunity to address those concerns.

     41. Counsel placed particular reliance on the findings of Bingham LJ in
         the case of R v Chief Constable of Thames Valley Police,  ex  parte
         Cotton [1990] IRLR 344,  citing  the  following  extract  from  the
         judgement:

             "While cases may no doubt arise in which it can properly be
             held that denying the subject of a decision an adequate
             opportunity to put his case is not in all the circumstances
             unfair, I would expect these cases to be of great rarity.
             There are a number of reasons for this:

             1.   unless the subject of the decision has had the
             opportunity to put his case it may not be easy to know what
             case he could or would have put if he had the chance.

             2.   As memorably pointed out by Megarry J in John v Rees
             [1970] Ch 345 at page 402, experience shows that what is
             confidently expected is by no means always that which happens.

             3.   It is generally desirable that decision-makers should be
             reasonably receptive to argument, and it would therefore be
             unfortunate if a complainant's position became weaker as the
             decision-maker's mind became more closed.

             4.   In considering whether the complainant's representations
             would have made any difference to the outcome the court may
             unconsciously stray from its proper province of reviewing the
             propriety of the decision-making process into the forbidden
             territory of evaluating the substantial merits of a decision.

             5.   This is a field in which appearances are generally
             thought to matter.

             6.   Where the decision-maker is under a duty to act fairly
             the subject of the decision may properly be said to have a
             right to be heard, and rights are not to be lightly denied."

     42. The above was subsequently adopted by the President  of  the  Upper
         Tribunal, McCloskey J in MM (unfairness; E & R) Sudan  [2014]  UKUT
         105 (IAC); and  the  case  of  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
         Department v Maheshwaran [2002] EWCA Civ 173, handed to  me  during
         the course of the hearing, where Schiemann LJ held at paragraph 4:

             "4.  Undoubtedly a failure to put to a party to  litigation  a
             point which is decided against him can be grossly  unfair  and
             lead to injustice. He must have a proper opportunity  to  deal
             with the point. Adjudicators must bear this in mind.  Where  a
             point is expressly conceded by one party it  will  usually  be
             unfair to decide the case against the other party on the basis
             that the concession was  wrongly  made,  unless  the  tribunal
             indicates that it is minded to take  that  course.  Cases  can
             occur when fairness will require the reopening  of  an  appeal
             because some point of significance - perhaps arising out of  a
             post hearing decision of the  higher  courts  -  requires  it.
             However, such cases will be rare."

     43. Schiemann LJ went on  however  to  add  that  the  requirements  of
         fairness are very much conditional on the facts of each  particular
         case.  While  it  is  open  to  a  tribunal  to  put  a  particular
         inconsistency to a witness, that  will  not  always  be  the  case,
         particularly if a party is represented.

     44. While undoubtedly the above principles will and do  have  relevance
         in appeals such as this, they need to be read through the lens that
         an appellant will still need to establish that there is a real,  as
         opposed to a purely minimal possibility that the outcome would have
         been different as the result of any omission; (per McCloskey  J  in
         MM (para 16), citing Simon Brown J's judgement).

     45. Secondly, it is also correct to observe that in the above cases the
         courts were considering the  much  broader  topic  of  a  litigants
         rights to a fair  hearing,  procedural  unfairness  and  unfairness
         resulting from a mistake of  fact,  rather  than  the  more  narrow
         confines submitted in the instant appeal relating to  the  contents
         of the judgement itself.

     46. The short answer to the point being advanced in the instant  appeal
         may be that the appellants were given the opportunity to put  their
         case and were represented by counsel. However,  to  understand  the
         complaint in context, it is necessary to  consider  the  3  grounds
         where it is said the judge did not put the point to  the  appellant
         during the course of the hearing, found at paragraphs 37,  50,  and
         53 of the judge's decision.

 Paragraph 37

     47. In terms of  paragraph  37,  having  considered  in  the  preceding
         paragraphs the 'remarkable differences' in  the  declared  incomes,
         and the discrepancies that arose as a result, the  judge  turns  to
         who actually provided the self-assessment tax returns submitted  to
         HMRC. The judge notes that when asked, the first  appellant  stated
         that in both cases the self-assessment tax returns  were  submitted
         by his accountant, Mr Gohil. The judge then goes on to note that in
         terms of 3 corporation  tax  returns,  a  different  accountant  is
         referred to, this time 'VZ Accountancy Services Ltd.' Only a  later
         letter from HMRC to the  appellant's  company,  dated  17  December
         2015, refers to Gohil Accountancy Services Ltd as  acting  for  the
         first appellant. This information the judge found was inconsistent.

     48. The judge then proceeds to make the following comment:

             "It is unlikely that the first appellant would have instructed
             two firms of  accountants,  concurrently,  to  deal  with  the
             company's tax affairs."

     49. I was asked to consider the above comment in the context of Bingham
         LJ's conclusions.  It was advanced that  the  unlikelihood  of  the
         appellant having two sets of accountants at the same time had never
         been put to the  first  appellant,  and  as  a  result,  the  first
         appellant had never been given the opportunity to respond to it.

     50. While I understand the basis of the concern, I do not share it. The
         representative is attempting to view such an expression of  opinion
         in isolation. I cannot see that anything turns on  this  particular
         point or that this sentence forms any  great  significance  to  the
         overall reasoning of the judge.

     51. The judge has adequately explained why reservations were  held.  It
         was a tension in the evidence that was not resolved. The  appellant
         was represented by counsel who could have asked about it  had  they
         wish to do so.

     52. I attempted to seek clarification during the course of the  hearing
         before me about the involvement of  VZ  Accountancy  Services,  and
         Counsel informed me that he could not speculate about that and then
         confirmed that he did not have instructions why  VZ  featured.  The
         point he said  was  that  the  appellant  had  not  been  given  an
         opportunity to deal with it. I hesitate to comment further.

     53. In my judgement, the appellants and others had every opportunity of
         clarifying this point during the course of the evidence or  by  way
         of evidence from the accountants themselves. There is no obligation
         on a judge to raise every conceivable point that  may  or  may  not
         have sway when they come to consider their judgement. The judge  in
         this case has set out the key factors on the  central  issue  under
         consideration. The judge's findings in relation  to  the  appellant
         not being a credible or a reliable  witness  were  supported  by  a
         number of other factors, beyond this one sentence, and I  therefore
         find no unfairness in the judge's approach in this regard.

Paragraph 50

     54. The second point raised in the grounds of appeal was that the judge
         had self-calculated the first appellant's  estimated  invoices  and
         then drawn conclusions that those figures were  markedly  different
         from the turnover of the company. Again, it was argued this  matter
         had not been put to the appellant.

     55. The relevant part of the judgement reads as follows (paragraph 50):



             "The first appellant also told me the reason he had failed  to
             declare  all  his  income  in  2013/14  was  because  he   had
             inadvertently  not  given  all  relevant   invoices   to   his
             accountant. There were, he said, 20 missing invoices.  I  have
             not been provided with copies of those invoices.  He  said  he
             contracted with his clients  to  work  on  long-term  projects
             which might last a year or two. He said each invoice  was  for
             between �1500 and �3500. He said he would be paid upfront and,
             mostly at the end of the project. I calculate the  approximate
             sums  due  on  those  20  invoices  was  between  �30,000  and
             �70,000." [My emphasis added.]

     56. Counsel argues that that calculation was never put to the appellant
         and  that  he  might  have  been  able  to  provide  some  form  of
         explanation. It was suggested there was detailed evidence that made
         this pivotal to his case.

     57. However persuasively counsel sought to argue the point,  ultimately
         the judge was simply reflecting that these  were  significant  sums
         that appeared to be out of step with the turnover of the appellants
         company in the years it had been trading. If there were 20  missing
         invoices, and each invoice was for  between  �1500  and  �3500,  it
         appears  to  me  the  judge  was  entitled  to  conclude  that  the
         approximate sums due on those  invoices  would  have  been  between
         �30,000  and  �70,000.  That  stood  with  the  evidence  that  the
         appellant had given. The notion that such a statement was something
         that Bingham LJ might have had in mind  in  order  to  establish  a
         ground of appeal appears to me to be misconceived.

     58. The explanation the appellant gave for not including these invoices
         was that he had simply failed to pass  them  onto  his  accountant.
         This suggests to me that they were available to him  (and  not,  as
         counsel hypothesised, the result of  some  delayed  transaction  or
         contract that may have had several years to run).

     59. The judge was stating what flowed from the evidence. It was  within
         the gift of counsel who represented the appellant at  the  time  to
         ask questions  about  any  statement  the  appellant  had  made  in
         relation to these missing invoices or advance further evidence. The
         mere fact that the judge has  looked  at  the  evidence  given  and
         approximated what that would mean in terms of turnover  appears  to
         me to be perfectly within the judicial function and there can be no
         question of any error of law.

Paragraph 53

     60. The third point that the appellant characterised  as  amounting  to
         procedural  unfairness  concerns  paragraph  53,  where  the  judge
         considers the increase in the appellant's income at  times  he  was
         due to make his application for leave to remain.

     61. The inference was that the first appellant had inflated his  income
         to  score  more  Tier  1  points.  The  assertion   made   by   his
         representative was that this was never put  to  the  appellant  and
         that it was perfectly plausible for applicants to  work  harder  in
         the years that they needed greater income levels.

     62. It is clear from the judge's recital of the respondent's case  that
         the Home Office  was  maintaining  that  the  first  appellant  had
         misrepresented his earnings at various times to HMRC and/or to  the
         respondent for the purpose of either reducing his tax liability  or
         the purpose of obtaining leave or both. (See, e.g., pages 3  and  4
         of the respondent's refusal letter, dated 30  January  2018.)  This
         would amount to either  deflating  or  inflating  the  said  income
         figures.

     63. The appellants could therefore not claim  to  have  been  taken  by
         surprise by the Home Office's case in this regard, as reflected  in
         the judge's comment.

     64. It appears to me that if there 'may have been a number  of  reasons
         why his income increased', then that was a matter for evidence  had
         the first appellant wished to adduce the same.

     65. Beyond the above, when  asked  about  what  the  evidence  was  for
         suggesting this was never put to  the  appellant,  counsel's  reply
         appeared to be that  while  it  may  have  been  suggested  in  the
         Secretary of State's refusal letter, it was  never  raised  in  the
         questionnaire.

     66. For my part, and even being generous towards the  point,  I  cannot
         see any prejudice caused to the appellants in the  judge  observing
         that the figures for the company's annual turnover were  higher  in
         the years when the first appellant applied for leave to remain as a
         Tier 1 (General) migrant. The findings the judge made in  terms  of
         profit and loss support this.  The judge had not closed the door on
         other possibilities, simply stating that a reasonable inference  to
         be drawn from this is  that  'at  best,  the  first  appellant  had
         attempted to manage his business  in  such  a  way  as  to  invoice
         clients in the months before he was due to apply and at worst,  the
         figures were unreliable'. In the context of the other  findings,  I
         find nothing material in the judge making that observation.

Conclusion

     67. Even looking at matters in the round, I cannot find that the  above
         three  examples  of  alleged  procedural  unfairness   would   have
         materially changed the outcome of this appeal. The decision is well
         constructed and well-considered, and even when viewed  together  or
         holistically, these points would not in my judgement  have  made  a
         marginal or any difference to the outcome of this appeal.  While  I
         apply appropriate caution in so concluding, to my mind there is  no
         element of speculation on that point. The decision of the judge  is
         clear, it is comprehensive and it is wide-ranging.

     68. The presenting officer, Ms Jones, was entitled, in my view, to  say
         that these were mere  assertions  without  any  evidence.  She  was
         correct to state that these were examples of the  judge  reflecting
         on what had been said by way of  evidence  and  drawing  reasonable
         conclusions.  I agree with her that this is  an  otherwise  cogent,
         rational and well-reasoned decision on the evidence. The presenting
         officer was also correct to observe that the appellant was not only
         represented by counsel at the hearing below,  but  had  prepared  a
         full statement where he addressed some  of  these  points,  clearly
         understanding the case that he had to answer.

     69. In response, counsel for the  respondent  said  he  would  like  an
         adjournment for the obtaining of  the  record  of  proceedings  and
         potentially further directions. He suggested that the Secretary  of
         State had not asserted any disagreement to the procedural  fairness
         points in terms of the matters not having been put and if they were
         disagreeing, then he would like the opportunity to obtain evidence.
         Not only did this application come late in the day, but it  appears
         to overlook the directions that Judge O'Connor gave in terms of the
         service of evidence, and furthermore would be unlikely  to  resolve
         the issue of what was said at the  hearing,  because  a  record  of
         proceedings is not a verbatim account. I can see no purpose at  all
         in adjourning matters.  Counsel's  confidence  that  the  appellant
         would have been able to deal with these things if they had been put
         to him was framed in part on speculation.

     70. For the above reasons, I dismiss these appeals. The proceedings  at
         first instance were adversarial and it  was  the  function  of  the
         judge to make findings on the evidence presented, and that is  what
         the judge has done.

     71. Both  parties  were  agreed  that  the  second  appellant's  appeal
         (HU/07268/2018) fell  or  succeeded  on  the  basis  of  the  first
         appellant's grounds. I therefore also dismiss that second appeal.



Notice of Decision

The appeals are dismissed.



No application was made for anonymity in this appeal. The  general  rule  is
that hearings are held in public and judicial decisions are published  (A  v
BBC [2014] UKSC 25) and I saw no reason to depart from the general  rule  in
this case.   Both  the  appellant's  representative  and  the  Secretary  of
State's  representative  agreed  that  any  anonymity  direction  could   be
dispensed with.
