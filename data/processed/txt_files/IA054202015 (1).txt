                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    For the sake of continuity I will refer to the parties  as  they  were
    before the First-tier Tribunal although technically  the  Secretary  of
    State is the appellant in the appeal to the Upper Tribunal.





Background

2.    On 27 October 2014 the appellant made  an  application  for  leave  to
    remain as the spouse of a British citizen  under  Appendix  FM  of  the
    immigration rules.

3.    The  respondent  refused  the  application  in  a  decision  dated  02
    February 2016. The respondent took no issue with the genuine nature  of
    the relationship but refused the application on  the  ground  that  the
    appellant  had  only  produced  limited  evidence  in  support  of  the
    application, which did not  meet  the  requirements  of  paragraphs  E-
    LTRP.3.1 to E-LTRP.3.4 of Appendix FM. The reasons for  refusal  letter
    made clear that the specified  evidence  must  come  from  the  sources
    listed in paragraph E-LTRP.3.2 and then set out the specified  evidence
    required to support an application. The respondent went on to  consider
    whether the appellant met the requirements of paragraph  EX.1  but  was
    not satisfied that there were insurmountable obstacles to the appellant
    and his wife continuing their family life in Vietnam.

4.      The   appellant   appealed   to   the   First-tier   Tribunal.   His
    representatives made an initial request for the hearing to be adjourned
    on the ground that he had been involved in a serious car  accident  but
    no evidence was produced to support the application, which was refused.
    The appellant's representatives then wrote to the  First-tier  Tribunal
    to ask for the matter to be determined 'on the papers'.

5.    First-tier Tribunal Judge Adio ("the judge")  allowed  the  appeal  in
    respect of  the  immigration  rules.  He  summarised  the  respondent's
    submissions as follows:

         "Mr Lumb made submissions. He stated that the Appellant had not met
         the financial requirements under Appendix  FM  of  the  Immigration
         rules and the Sponsor is not here to give evidence.  The  test  for
         insurmountable obstacles is high according to the case  of  Agyarko
         and Others [2015] EWCA Civ 440. He stated that paragraph 276ADE  of
         the Immigration Rules have not been met."[3]

6.    The judge's findings were made in a single concluding paragraph:

         "Each appeal is to be decided on its own facts. The burden of proof
         is on the Appellant and the standard of proof is on  a  balance  of
         probability. I have taken into account the submissions made  by  Mr
         Lumb and the documentary evidence before me in deciding the case. I
         have taken into account the witness  statements  submitted  by  the
         Appellant and the Sponsor. Firstly I find that the  respondent  has
         not taken any issue with the relationship of the Appellant and  his
         wife and therefore the only real issue for me to decide is  whether
         the Appellant meets the financial requirements under the Rules  and
         failing that whether paragraph EX.1 can avail the Appellant and  if
         not Article 8. The Appellant states that his wife runs a nail salon
         called Shannon's beauty as a self-employed  person  from  Stratford
         Shopping Centre at London E15 1XQ and her earnings from  her  self-
         employment in the last financial year  exceeded  the  threshold  of
         �18,600. The statement is dated 10th August 2015 and is signed. His
         wife Mrs Nguyen  also  states  the  same.  I  have  considered  the
         documentary evidence before  me.  The  respondent  has  not  really
         stated that the  documents  were  not  before  her  only  that  the
         Appellant does not meet the financial requirements. I note that the
         amount of income quoted from the Sponsor's self-employment  in  the
         Home Office application form is  �19,257.  The  Grounds  of  Appeal
         state that the Respondent was erroneous in stating that  there  was
         insufficient  documentary  evidence  given  the  totality  of   the
         evidence provided. Mr Lumb did not take the issue  before  me  that
         the Appellant did not meet the requirements of  Appendix  FM-SE  of
         the Immigration Rules and therefore I do not take this as an issue.
         The  issue  I  have  to  consider  is  whether  substantively   the
         Appellant's  Sponsor  earns  over  �18,600.  The  tax  return   for
         Shannon's Beauty for the year ending 31st March 2015 which is  just
         about two months before the respondent's  decision  indicates  that
         the Sponsor earned �19,257. This is indicated  in  the  profit  and
         loss account for the year 31st March 2015. This is  also  reflected
         in the tax return which was returned to the Inland Revenue on  16th
         October 2014. I therefore find on the evidence before me  that  the
         declaration to the Inland Revenue which is not analysed at  all  in
         the respondent's refusal notice indicates that  the  Sponsor  earns
         above the threshold in her self-employment.  I  therefore  conclude
         that the  appellant  meets  the  requirements  of  the  Immigration
         rules."[4]

7.    The respondent seeks to appeal the  First-tier  Tribunal  decision  on
    the ground that the judge erred in taking into  account  earnings  from
    self-employment that did not cover  the  relevant  period  required  in
    Appendix FM-SE of the immigration rules. The grounds quote paragraph  7
    of Appendix FM-SE, which states that all the documents specified in the
    list were required.

8.    First-tier Tribunal Judge Lambert granted permission to appeal on  the
    ground that is was arguable that the judge had  a  duty  to  apply  the
    relevant law correctly having regard  to  the  relevant  provisions  of
    Appendix FM-SE.

Decision and reasons

9.    After having considered the grounds of appeal  and  oral  arguments  I
    satisfied that the First-tier Tribunal decision involved the making  of
    an error on a point of law.

10.   The Court of Appeal in SSHD v SS (Congo)  and  Others  [2015]  Imm  AR
    1036 emphasised that the evidential requirements contained in  Appendix
    FM-SE stipulated the form of evidence required to  substantiate  claims
    that the financial requirements under Appendix FM  have  been  met.  If
    those requirements were not met the approach should be the same  as  if
    an applicant did not meet the substantive aspects  of  the  rules  i.e.
    there would have to be compelling circumstances to justify a  grant  of
    leave to remain. In other words, the evidential requirements  contained
    in Appendix FM-SE must be satisfied in order to meet  the  requirements
    of the immigration rules.

11.   In any event, this is apparent from the plain wording  of  the  rules.
    Paragraph E-LTRP.3.1 states that the applicant must provide  "specified
    evidence" from the sources listed in paragraph E-LTRP.3.2 to show  that
    his or her partner has a specified gross  annual  income  of  at  least
    �18,600. Paragraph E-LTRP.3.2  states  that  for  the  purpose  of  the
    financial requirement only the listed sources of income make  be  taken
    into account. Amongst others these include income from "specified" self-
    employment.

12.   Appendix FM-SE also makes clear that specified evidence  needs  to  be
    provided in order to satisfy the requirements contained in Appendix FM.
    The introductory paragraphs A-B state:

         "A.      This Appendix sets out the specified  evidence  applicants
             need to provide to meet the requirements of rules contained in
             Appendix FM and, where those requirements are  also  contained
             in other rules, including Appendix Armed  Forces,  and  unless
             otherwise stated, the specified evidence  applicants  need  to
             provide to meet the requirements of those rules.

         B. Where evidence is not specified by Appendix FM, but is of a type
             covered by this Appendix, the requirements  of  this  Appendix
             shall apply."

13.   In this case the appellant relied on his sponsor's income as  a  self-
    employed person. The relevant part of Appendix FM-SE is paragraph 7. At
    the date of application it specified the following list of evidence  in
    order to meet the financial requirement.

         "7.      In respect of self-employment in the UK as a partner, as a
             sole trader or in a franchise all of  the  following  must  be
             provided:

             (a) Evidence of the amount of tax payable, paid and unpaid for
                  the last full financial year.

             (b) The following documents for the last full financial  year,
                  or for the last two such years (where those documents show
                  the necessary level of gross income as an average of those
                  two years):

                  (i)  annual self-assessment tax return to HMRC (a copy  or
                      print-out); and

                  (ii) Statement of Account (SA300 or SA302).

             (c) Proof  of  registration  with  HMRC  as  self-employed  if
                  available.

             (d) Each partner's Unique Tax Reference  Number  (UTR)  and/or
                  the UTR of the partnership or business.

             (e) Where the person holds or held a  separate  business  bank
                  account(s), bank statements for the same  12-month  period
                  as the tax return(s).

             (f) Personal bank statements for the same 12-month  period  as
                  the tax return(s)  showing  that  the  income  from  self-
                  employment has been paid into an account in  the  name  of
                  the person or in the name of the person and their  partner
                  jointly.

             (g) Evidence of ongoing self-employment  through  evidence  of
                  payment of Class 2 National Insurance contributions.

             (h) One of the following documents must also be submitted:

                  (i)  (aa)  If the business is required to  produce  annual
                      audited accounts, such accounts  for  the  last  full
                      financial year; or

                      (bb)  If the business  is  not  required  to  produce
                           annual audited accounts, unaudited  accounts  for
                           the last full financial year and an  accountant's
                           certificate of confirmation, from  an  accountant
                           who is a member of a  UK  Recognised  Supervisory
                           Body (as defined in the Companies Act 2006);

                  (ii) A certificate of VAT registration and the VAT  return
                      for the last full financial year (a  copy  or  print-
                      out)  confirming  the  VAT  registration  number,  if
                      turnover is in excess of �79,000 or was in excess  of
                      the threshold which  applied  during  the  last  full
                      financial year;

                  (iii)        Evidence   to   show   appropriate   planning
                      permission or local  planning  authority  consent  is
                      held to operate the type/class  of  business  at  the
                      trading address (where  this  is  a  local  authority
                      requirement); or

                  (iv) A franchise agreement signed by both parties."

14.   It is argued on behalf of the appellant that the  judge  was  entitled
    to take into account the fact that the  respondent  did  not  make  any
    specific submissions or "take the issue" (in the words  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge) in relation to the specified evidence contained in
    Appendix FM-SE. However, it is quite clear from the reasons for refusal
    letter that  the  respondent  was  not  satisfied  that  the  specified
    evidence needed to meet the requirements  of  paragraph  E-LTRP.3.2  of
    Appendix FM was produced in support of the  application.  The  list  of
    specified documents outlined in the reasons for refusal letter,  whilst
    not specifically identified as being drawn from Appendix FM-SE, was the
    same list of documents outlined in paragraph 7 of Appendix FM-SE.

15.   It is clear  that  the  respondent's  representative  at  the  hearing
    continued to argue that  the  appellant  did  not  meet  the  financial
    requirements of the immigration rules. As set out above, the  financial
    requirements  include  the  requirements  contained  in  paragraphs  E-
    LTRP.3.1-3.4 as well as the specified evidence  required  to  show  the
    relevant income from,  in  this  case,  self-employment.  There  is  no
    evidence  to  show  that  any  specific  concession  was  made  by  the
    Presenting Officer in relation to Appendix FM-SE.

16.    There  is  nothing  in  the  judge's  findings  to  suggest  that  he
    considered whether the  evidence  before  him  satisfied  the  relevant
    provisions. His findings suggest that he took a broad brush approach to
    the evidence. While it may be that he was satisfied  in  general  terms
    that the evidence showed on  the  balance  of  probabilities  that  the
    sponsor was likely to be earning above the �18,600 required,  that  was
    not the legal question he was required to answer. The Court  of  Appeal
    in SS (Congo) made clear that the specified documents form part of  the
    substantive requirements of  the  immigration  rules.  Paragraph  7  of
    Appendix FM-SE makes clear that  tax  returns  must  cover  a  specific
    period preceding the date of application, which on the face of it,  the
    tax return for the year 2014/2015 did not satisfy. Whilst I do not make
    any specific findings in relation  to  the  eventual  outcome  of  this
    appeal, even brief consideration of  the  evidence  provided  with  the
    application and in support of the appeal appears to disclose  a  number
    of possible gaps in the specified evidence.

17.   For the reasons given above I conclude that the judge erred in  taking
    a general approach to the evidence without proper reference or analysis
    of whether the evidence was sufficient to meet the requirements of  the
    relevant legal framework contained in Appendices FM and  FM-SE  of  the
    immigration rules.

18.   In light of my decision both parties were agreed that the  matter  has
    to be remitted for a fresh hearing before the First-tier  Tribunal.  No
    findings were made in relation to paragraph EX.1 or Article  8  outside
    the immigration rules. All issues must be reheard.

DECISION

The First-tier Tribunal decision involved the making of an error on a  point
of law

I set aside the decision and remit the appeal  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal
for a fresh hearing
