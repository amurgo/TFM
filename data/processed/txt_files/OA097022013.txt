Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms F Shaw
For the Respondent:    Mr P Armstrong (HOPO)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge N M Paul, promulgated on 26th June 2014, following a  hearing  at
    Richmond on 9th January 2014.  In the determination, the judge  allowed
    the appeal of Muhammad Umar Baig.  The Respondent subsequently  applied
    for, and was granted, permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal,  and
    thus the matter comes before me.



The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan.  He is a male.  He was born  on
    26th December 1981.  He applied for entry clearance, as the partner  of
    his wife, Mrs Musrat Irshad Shaid, a person present and settled in  the
    UK, under Appendix FM, and submitted documents relating  to  her  self-
    employment.  On 20th March 2013,  his  application  was  rejected.   He
    appeals against that rejection.

The Appellant's Claim

 3. The evidence that the Appellant relies upon is evidence of the marriage
    on 24th July 2011, evidence of the Sponsor's income  for  the  relevant
    period, her self-employment of �5,620, and from her property income, of
    �33,152.  Attached to the wife's witness statement were profit and loss
    accounts for the period 30th September 2012, which had been accompanied
    by pay slips from 30th April 2012 to 31st October 2012 (see paragraph 3
    of the determination).  Also submitted was evidence attached  with  the
    application, of a tax return computation, for  the  period  ending  5th
    April 2012, which showed the sponsoring wife's income  from  employment
    and property as a total of over �42,000 (paragraph 5).

The Judge's Findings

 4. The judge had regard to the  fact  that  at  the  appeal  hearing,  the
    Appellant's bundle produced evidence of title deeds, for not  only  the
    Sponsor's home address, but for four other rental properties, and there
    were also bank accounts, for the period June to December  2013.   These
    bank accounts were in the name of the Sponsor.  The judge said that

         "... they clearly showed that substantial sums are  being  paid  in
         relation to rental properties.  The reference is 'Lets Locate'  and
         this appears to be the company/business handling the rental income.
          It is plain from looking at these six months' statements that  the
         Sponsor  receives  a  significant  income  from   her   properties"
         (paragraph 7).

    The appeal was allowed.

Grounds of Application

 5. The grounds of application state that the judge erred  in  law  because
    the judge  had  accepted  that  the  evidence  provided  postdated  the
    decision (at paragraph 10) and then failed to conclude  that  this  did
    not comply with the Immigration Rules.

 6. Second, the Tribunal did not have appropriate regard  to  the  relevant
    date because for Appendix FM  the  significant  date  is  the  date  of
    application, and the significant evidence is from the specified  period
    before that date, and this evidence was missing.

 7. On 3rd November 2014, permission to appeal was granted.



Submissions

 8. At the hearing before me on 2nd December 2014, Mr Armstrong,  appearing
    on behalf of the Respondent, relied upon the  grounds  of  application.
    He submitted that there was a material misdirection in law.  The  judge
    failed to have  regard  to  Appendix  FM-SE  at  paragraph  11  of  the
    determination.  He went on to consider postdecision evidence.  The date
    of the decision is 20th March 2013 but the date of the  application  is
    January 2013 and what the Appellant had to show  was  evidence  of  six
    months prior to that date of application.

 9. For her part, Ms Shaw, appearing on behalf of the Appellant,  submitted
    that this was simply not the case.  There was no material  error.   The
    Sponsor's income was known at the date of the decision,  and  this  was
    clear from Appendix C, which was attached to the application.

10. This was in the Respondent's own  bundle.   Included  in  this,  was  a
    document, Appendix 2 (VAF 4A November 2012).  At  the  bottom  of  this
    page (which is page 1 of the Appendix 2,  financial  requirement  form,
    there is a section headed "part one", and at page 5 of  this  document,
    under the heading "meeting the financial  requirement",  the  Appellant
    has inserted compliance with "income from self-employment".  At page  9
    of this document, there is a  question  at  question  3.58,  "how  much
    income did your Sponsor earn (before tax) from self-employment  in  the
    last full financial year?", and the answer is "�5,620".  At page 10  of
    the document, the  Appellant  lists  the  sources  of  income,  and  at
    question 3.62, in response to the  question  "what  is  your  Sponsor's
    total annual income from non-employment sources?", the Appellant  gives
    the answer "�33,152".

11. The question then arises as to whether this income is  postdecision  or
    pre-decision.  Accompanying the documentation before the  Tribunal  was
    an annual account from "Kayal Associates".  This is what the judge  had
    in mind.  He could see where the income came from.

12. If there was any further doubt, then the Rules allow a  decision  maker
    to ask for evidence that can  supplement  existing  evidence  that  has
    already been provided.  Given that no such request was made,  what  the
    annual account statement stipulated, should have  been  taken  at  face
    value, because it was plainly not in  question.   The  annual  business
    account refers to the income.  At page 8 of this document the income is
    set out.

13. In reply, Mr Armstrong submitted that the fact was that the  judge  did
    not, at paragraphs 10 to 11, have regard to the  Immigration  Rules  in
    Appendix FM-SE.  It was true that there was  a  two  page  letter  from
    Kayal Associates confirming the annual business  accounts.   But  there
    was nothing to back this up.  It was just a  letter.   There  were  pay
    slips from "Fancy Hairstyles", but the Appellant's  own  representative
    had accepted at the hearing that the specified evidence  had  not  been
    submitted in relation to this (see paragraph 8).



No Error of Law

14. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  did  not
    involve the making of an error on a point of law (see Section 12(1)  of
    TCEA 2007) such that I should set aside the decision.  This is because,
    in what is a comprehensive determination, where the judge sets out what
    was provided, and what was not provided, he concludes, on the basis  of
    the evidence that was produced before him at the hearing, of an  annual
    account from Kayal Associates.

15. The fact that there was a tax calculation provided by the HMRC for  the
    year  2012,  "that  the  Sponsor  received   a   property   income   of
    approximately �33,000" (see  paragraph  9)  plainly  referred  back  to
    evidence that appertained to the date of the decision.  The application
    form had set out income from various sources  in  Appendix  2  (VAF  4A
    November 2012).  This was the "financial requirement form".

16. There was a letter provided with respect to the  annual  accounts.   If
    any information was needed with greater particularity, a request  could
    have been made.  This is what the Rules are for.  The Rules  allow  for
    such requests.  Given that there is very limited  discretion,  such  as
    that there is, ought not to be overlooked.

17. If the judge looked at postdecision evidence, he did so on the basis of
    the well-established Rule in DR (Morocco), which  was  referred  to  at
    paragraph 9 of the determination, when he concluded that,

         "it appeared to me that the bank  statements  for  the  six  months
         ending in December 2013  (although  postdating  the  decision)  had
         nevertheless demonstrated - solely for that period and therefore by
         way of reasonable inference - for the period  of  at  least  twelve
         months prior to the date of decision, that the Sponsor had been  in
         receipt of property income as set  out  in  the  HMRC  computation"
         (paragraph 10).

    There is no error in the determination.

Decision

18. There is no material error of law in the Immigration Judge's  decision.
    The determination shall stand.

19. No anonymity order is made.
