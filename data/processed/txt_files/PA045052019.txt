                                    [S J]
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                            DECISION AND REMITTAL


 1. On 4 March 2021 I wrote to the parties as follows:


         "Permission to appeal was  granted  in  this  case  in  July  2020.
         Directions were sent out on 7 October.  There has  been  a  lengthy
         response from the appellant, but none from the Respondent.  Despite
         enquiries  from  the  Tribunal's  staff,  no  response   from   the
         Respondent has come to light.


         I have reviewed the file.  In the light of the grant of  permission
         and the grounds of appeal and submissions, which stand unopposed, I
         propose without more ado to set aside the decision  of  the  First-
         tier Tribunal for error of law and remit the appellant's appeal  to
         the First-tier Tribunal for decision afresh.


         Any submissions to the contrary  will  be  considered  if  received
         within 14 days of the date of this letter."

 2. There has been no substantive response from either party, and  none  at
    all from the Respondent.

 3. I now set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal sent out on  25
    March 2020 for error of law as identified in the grant of permission to
    appeal.  I remit the appellant's appeal to the First-tier Tribunal  for
    a fresh decision.




                                                             C.M.G. Ockelton


                                                           C. M. G. OCKELTON
                                        VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UPPER TRIBUNAL
                                              IMMIGRATION AND ASYLUM CHAMBER
                                                         Date: 15 April 2021
