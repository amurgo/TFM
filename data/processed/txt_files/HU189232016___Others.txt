Representation:

For the Appellants:  Mr E Anyene of Counsel instructed by Malik Law
                    Chambers Solicitors
For the Respondent: Miss A Holmes

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellants are citizens of Mauritius.   The  first  appellants  are
    the parents of the third named appellant who was born on 2 August 1991.
     They appeal the determination of a First-tier  Judge  who  decided  to
    refuse their appeals following a hearing on 2 March 2017.

2.   There is a somewhat complicated  background  to  the  circumstances  in
    which the appeals came before the First-tier Judge which  he  helpfully
    sets out in the following extract from his determination:

         "4.  There are two sets of appeals before me.  The  first  in  time
             are  the  immigration  appeals  whereby  the  Appellants,   in
             applications made in September 2014, sought to remain  in  the
             UK based on their Article 8 rights outside the rules  as  well
             as under Paragraph 276ADE based on their private lives  within
             the rules.  The second set are based on Paragraph 276B and the
             claim that the First Appellant can show that she has at  least
             10 years continuous lawful residence in the UK  and  that  the
             Second and Third Appellants can remain as her dependants.


         5.   I need to set out some of the history.   The  First  Appellant
             claims to have entered the UK as a visitor on 2nd January 2005
             and subsequently she was granted leave as a student until 30th
             June 2008.  The Appellants were granted  residence  cards  for
             the period between 7th October 2009 and 7th  October  2014  as
             extended family members of an EEA national.  The EEA  national
             was the French wife of the First and Second Appellant's eldest
             son with whom the Appellants all lived.


         6.   The Appellants made applications in  September  2014  and  the
             First Appellant's form appears at A1-46  of  the  Respondent's
             bundle accompanied by a covering letter that appears  at  B1-5
             of the Respondent's bundle.  As I have said their claims  were
             based on their Article 8 rights outside the rules as  well  as
             under Paragraph 276ADE within the rules.  At  that  stage  the
             First Appellant had not lived in  the  UK  for  10  years  and
             therefore could not meet the 10  years  of  continuous  lawful
             residence in the UK requirement and did not therefore seek  to
             claim on that basis.


         7.   Their applications made in  September  2014  were  refused  in
             immigration decisions dated variously 31st December  2014  and
             5th January 2015.  The Appellants appealed and  those  appeals
             were listed for hearing but were adjourned on 13th  June  2016
             (and thereafter) but were eventually listed before me.


         8.   The reason for the adjournments was that on  4th  April  2016,
             the First Appellant having lived in the UK for over  10  years
             by that time, made an  application  for  indefinite  leave  to
             remain based on 10 years of continuous lawful residence in the
             UK.  That application was refused with the reasons given in  a
             letter of 21st July 2016.  The main grounds were, it was said,
             that the Appellants could not show that the First  Appellant's
             10 years of continuous lawful residence in the UK was met even
             though she might have shown that she had lived in the UK since
             January 2005.  The Respondent in the refusal letter said  'The
             evidence you provided did not show that you were  still  in  a
             subsisting relationship and did not show that your sponsor was
             still in the UK exercising  treaty  rights'.   The  Respondent
             cited regulation 7 and 9 of the Immigration (EEA)  Regulations
             2006 ('the EEA regulations) and said that the Appellants could
             not  meet  the  requirements  of  those  regulations  and   in
             consequence  show  that  the  First  Appellant  had  met   the
             requirements of 10 years continuous lawful residence".


3.   The judge heard oral  evidence  from  the  appellants.   The  arguments
    before  the  First-tier  Judge  focused  on  Regulation  7(3)  of   the
    Immigration (European Economic  Area)  Regulations  2006  (SI  2006  No
    1003).  The judge noted in paragraph 13 of his decision  that  extended
    family members issued with a residence card as the appellants had  been
    should be treated as a family member of the relevant EEA  national  "as
    long as they continue to satisfy the conditions in  regulation  8(2)(c)
    which requires that the family members continue either to be  dependent
    on her or be a member of her household".

4.   The judge found that the  second  legal  aspect  was  the  question  of
    Article 8 outside the Rules.  He was referred to Agyarko [2017] UKSC 11
    and in particular paragraph 60 where he highlighted the following words
    when referring to the Secretary  of  State's  definition  of  the  word
    exceptional as meaning "circumstances in which refusal would result  in
    unjustifiably harsh consequences  for  the  individual  such  that  the
    refusal of the application would not be proportionate".  The judge also
    referred to Treebhawon and  Others  [2017]  UKUT  00013  (IAC),  citing
    paragraph 3 of the head note which reads as follows:

         "Mere hardship, mere difficulty, mere hurdles,  mere  upheaval  and
         mere inconvenience, even where multiplied, are unlikely to  satisfy
         the test of 'very significant hurdles' in paragraph 276 ADE of  the
         Immigration Rules".

5.   The judged noted in paragraph 16 of his decision that the EEA  national
    - the first appellant's daughter-in-law - had ceased to be employed  in
    2012 or 2013.  Thereafter the family had  pooled  their  resources  but
    were all living together in the same house until November 2014 when the
    daughter-in-law and her husband returned to France.   Noting  that  the
    first appellant had arrived in the  UK  on  2  January  2005  and  that
    paragraph 276B required ten years living in the UK this would not  have
    been achieved by the first appellant until 2 January 2015 by which time
    the appellants were no longer living in the same household or dependent
    on  the  EEA  national.   Accordingly  paragraph  8(2)(c)  of  the  EEA
    Regulations could not be met during that period.  Moreover, there  were
    problems with Regulation 6 given that the first appellant had said that
    her daughter-in-law had been a worker until late 2012 or early 2013 but
    not thereafter.  She could not comply with the  Regulations  concerning
    having comprehensive sickness insurance cover  -  it  was  conceded  by
    Counsel that there was no evidence of this.  The judge found  that  the
    EEA  national  was  not  exercising  treaty  rights  after   2013   and
    accordingly it could not be shown that  the  first  appellant  met  the
    requirements  to  show  ten  years'  continuous  lawful  residence   in
    accordance with the Rules for  the  period  from  early  2013  until  2
    January 2015 and accordingly none of  the  appellants  could  meet  the
    requirements of paragraph  276B  of  the  Rules  and  show  ten  years'
    continuous lawful residence.

6.   The judge then turned to consider paragraph 276ADE(1) and (vi)  of  the
    Rules and Article 8 outside the Rules.  He noted that the  first  named
    appellant had lived in the UK since 2005 and had stayed here apart from
    a two month holiday in Mauritius in 2011.  She  had  been  educated  in
    Mauritius although she had completed various courses in  the  UK.   She
    had two sisters who remained in Mauritius in addition  to  her  mother.
    She had married the second appellant in Mauritius in December 1978  and
    they had three children.   The  eldest  was  in  France  with  the  EEA
    national.  The second son had married and lived with his wife  and  two
    sons in Mauritius although the couple were  now  divorced.   The  third
    appellant had been educated in Mauritius and had arrived in the UK when
    he was about 15 and had done his GCSEs and A levels in  the  UK  before
    completing a BA (Hons) degree and then  an  MBA  in  the  UK.   He  was
    currently working as a car mechanic.  The  second  appellant  had  been
    working in the UK since 2007 and was earning a gross annual  salary  of
    �26,000.

7.   The judge accepted that the appellants had strong  connections  to  the
    UK and had never claimed off the state but he did not accept that  they
    had lost all ties and connections  to  Mauritius  given  the  relatives
    there and their visit in 2011.

8.   In oral evidence the first named appellant said her  mother  was  still
    alive and she had visited Mauritius for two months in 2011.  Her middle
    son had always lived in Mauritius and had visited the UK only  once  or
    twice and had his own business there.

9.   In  his  conclusions  the  judge  referred  to  his  finding  that  the
    appellants could not meet the relevant requirements of the  Regulations
    and demonstrate ten years'  continuous  lawful  residence  as  required
    under paragraph 276B  of  the  Immigration  Rules.   The  determination
    concludes as follows:

         "41. I conclude that given their connections with Mauritius,  their
             age when the First and Second Appellants came to the  UK,  the
             education that all three have obtained whilst in  the  UK  the
             Appellants can at best show mere  hardship,  mere  difficulty,
             mere hurdles, mere upheaval and mere inconvenience but  cannot
             satisfy the test of 'very significant hurdles'.  I  find  that
             they cannot meet the requirements of Paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi).


         42.  Turning to Article 8 outside the rules.  Clearly Article 8  is
             engaged and I have to decide whether at  looking  at  all  the
             evidence it would result in unjustifiably harsh consequences.


         43.  I have considerable sympathy for the Appellants.   From  their
             standpoint they must feel that their case is exceptional and I
             understand that they would prefer to remain in  the  UK  where
             they have been for over a decade.   They  speak  English,  are
             financially independent and are integrated however they cannot
             meet the immigration rules.  Their  immigration  position  has
             always been precarious  and  from  2009  based  on  their  EEA
             national daughter in law.  All of the  Appellants  have  lived
             longer in Mauritius than in  the  UK.   All  are  healthy  and
             relatively young.  All were educated in Mauritius (as well  as
             in the UK).  They have  family  in  Mauritius  and  the  First
             Appellant visited relatively recently.  It seems to me that in
             those circumstances I could not  conclude  that  the  decision
             would  not  be  proportionate  or  have  unjustifiably   harsh
             consequences".

10.  Accordingly the judge dismissed the appeal under the  Rules  and  under
    Article 8.  In the grounds of appeal reference  was  made  to  Huang  v
    Secretary of State [2007] UKHL 11 and Razgar [2004] UKHL 27 and it  was
    argued that the judge had failed to form an independent  and  impartial
    view of the weight to be afforded to the  Secretary  of  State's  case.
    There had been an error in approach to the  question  of  compassionate
    and compelling  circumstances  and  the  judge  had  failed  to  attach
    appropriate weight to the circumstances of the appellant.

11.  Permission to appeal was granted  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  on  22
    September 2017.  A reply was filed on 13 October 2017 in which  it  was
    noted that it had not been shown that the appellants could meet the EEA
    Regulations beyond 2013 and accordingly ten years'  residence  had  not
    been established.  The judge had properly directed himself and  applied
    the law correctly.

12.  At the hearing Counsel relied on the grounds.  He  submitted  that  the
    judge had failed to consider 276ADE(v) - the third appellant, the  son,
    had been aged under 25 as at the date of the application.   The  second
    appellant had been working since January 2007 having  arrived  in  this
    country in 2006.  He was in charge of two care homes.  It was an  error
    of law to focus on the family life in Mauritius.  There was a  question
    whether the EEA national  was  still  exercising  treaty  rights.   The
    family had come very close to meeting the Rules.

13.  Miss Holmes relied on the Rule 24 response.  It had  been  accepted  by
    Counsel acting for the First-tier Judge that the  Rules  could  not  be
    met.  The grounds of appeal did not refer to Agyarko although the judge
    had  been  referred  to  that  authority.   The   judge   had   clearly
    demonstrated in paragraph 43 of his determination why the appeals could
    not succeed.  He had made it clear that the appellants  had  all  lived
    longer in Mauritius than in the UK.  He had been bound to conclude that
    the decision was not disproportionate or unduly harsh.  I was  referred
    to  paragraphs  54  to  57  of  Agyarko  in  relation  to   exceptional
    circumstances.  Where family life  was  precarious  a  very  strong  or
    compelling case was required.  Miss Holmes also referred to  Treebhawon
    and it was clear that the judge had applied the principles in this case
    in paragraph 41 of his determination.

14.   Counsel submitted that there had been no  precariousness  involved  in
    the situation of the appellants.  When the EEA national had returned to
    France their leave had carried on and they were very close  to  meeting
    the Rules.

15.  At the conclusion of the submissions I reserved my decision.  I  remind
    myself that I can only interfere with the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Judge if it was flawed in law.

16.  No point is taken in the grounds of appeal  that  the  Rules  had  been
    satisfied.  The case was not  argued  on  the  basis  that  the  second
    appellant satisfied the requirements of 276ADE(1)(v) no  doubt  because
    although he  fell  within  the  relevant  age  range  at  the  time  of
    application he  had  not  spent  at  least  half  of  his  life  living
    continuously in the UK, he had arrived at the age of 15 as appears from
    paragraph 27 of the determination.  The argument is without  merit  and
    did not feature in the grounds.

17.  The judge was clearly sympathetic with the position of  the  appellants
    and noted the positive  aspects  of  their  cases.   However  he  quite
    clearly rejected the claim that they had lost all ties and  connections
    to Mauritius as he says in paragraph 30 of his decision "I have to  say
    with a mother, two sisters and a son in the Mauritius plus a  visit  by
    her in 2011 I cannot accept  that".   The  judge  makes  the  point  in
    paragraph 43 of his decision that all the appellants had  lived  longer
    in Mauritius than in the UK.   He  directed  himself  by  reference  to
    Agyarko and Treebhawon and did not misdirect himself in concluding that
    the appellants could at best show "mere hardship, mere difficulty, mere
    hurdles, mere upheaval and mere inconvenience" but  could  not  satisfy
    the test under the Rules.

18.  The grounds of appeal did not refer to  Agyarko  and  did  not  make  a
    complaint that the judge erred in taking into  account  the  precarious
    nature of the status of the appellants  in  the  UK.   In  relation  to
    Article 8 outside the Rules  as  the  judge  observed  apart  from  the
    question of living longer in Mauritius than in the UK all were  healthy
    and relatively young and all were educated in Mauritius as well  as  in
    the UK.  They had family in  Mauritius  and  the  first  appellant  had
    visited relatively recently.  In those  circumstances  as  Miss  Holmes
    submitted the judge had little  option  but  to  conclude  as  he  did.
    Agyarko made the position quite clear.

19.  For the reasons I  have  given  I  am  not  satisfied  that  the  judge
    materially erred in law and I direct that his decision shall stand  and
    this appeal is dismissed.
