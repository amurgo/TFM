Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr S Shah, of 786 Law Associates
For the Respondent:    Ms A Everett, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1. The appellant is a Pakistani national born on 3 May 1977.  He  challenges
the determination of First-tier Tribunal Judge  Malcolm,  promulgated  on  1
February 2018, dismissing his appeal against  the  respondent's  refusal  to
issue him a residence card as the spouse of an EEA (Polish) national.



2.  Permission  to  appeal  against  the  determination  of  the  First-tier
Tribunal was refused by Judge Doyle on 30 May 2018 but  granted  on  renewal
by Judge Storey on 6 August  2018.  Judge  Storey  considered  that  it  was
arguable that the judge erred in raising the issue of whether  the  marriage
was one  of  convenience  because  this  had  not  been  relied  on  by  the
respondent. He also considered it arguable that  the  judge  had  failed  to
identify what additional documentary evidence he required  to  be  satisfied
that the appellant's wife was  exercising  treaty  rights  in  the  UK.  The
matter then came before me on 1 October 2018.

The Hearing

3. The appellant and his wife were present  at  the  hearing  when  I  heard
submissions from the parties. A full  note  is  set  out  in  my  Record  of
Proceedings.

4. Mr Shah begun his submissions by arguing  that  the  respondent  had  not
raised the issue of the relationship and so the  judge  had  been  wrong  to
determine it. When I pointed out to him that it had been raised by the  Home
Office Presenting Officer at the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal,  he
agreed. He also confirmed that he had  represented  the  appellant  at  that
hearing and had not raised any objection to the matter  being  raised.  When
asked whether his submission  was  that  the  judge  should  not  have  made
findings on the issue, he conceded that the judge was required to deal  with
it. He chose not to pursue that ground but to amend it. He  then  maintained
that although the judge had  been  entitled  to  consider  the  matter,  his
findings on the evidence were flawed as he had not given due weight  to  the
evidence before him. He maintained that the appellant and sponsor  had  been
living together since 2011. they had since married. If  the  respondent  had
an issue with the claim, he should have arranged a visit to the  appellant's
house. It was inconvenient for  the  appellant  and  sponsor  to  travel  to
Liverpool due to the distance and  the  expense.   Mr  Shah  relied  on  the
judgment in Sadovska [2017] UKSC 54 where the court held that  the  Tribunal
had placed too much weight on the  interview  without  considering  all  the
other evidence. Mr Shah submitted that in the present case, too much  weight
had been placed on the fact that the appellant and sponsor had not  attended
an interview.

5. Mr Shah submitted that with respect to the issue of whether  the  sponsor
was exercising treaty rights, there had been a bundle  of  300  pages.  This
included  unaudited  accounts,  bank  statements  and   invoices   of   self
employment. He questioned what else the  sponsor  could  have  provided.  He
maintained that the reference to �70,000 in earnings by  the  judge  was  an
error by the interpreter (I note that the grounds maintain the sponsor  said
she earned �17,000 not �70,000). He submitted that the judge had  also  been
wrong to place weight  on  the  adverse  findings  made  by  three  previous
Tribunals as those appeals were in respect of different applications.

6. Mr Shah submitted that the judge gave no explanation for why he  did  not
consider it determinative that the  couple  had  been  given  permission  to
marry. He questioned why the sponsor would still be with  the  appellant  if
the marriage had been a sham. He submitted that they were  together  because
this was a genuine relationship and  they  wanted  to  raise  a  family.  He
submitted that the appeal had been ongoing since  2016  and  should  now  be
allowed outright.

7. In response, Ms Everett submitted that there was no  error  of  law.  She
argued that the issue of the marriage had been raised  at  the  hearing  and
there had been no objections raised. There had  been  cross  examination  on
the matter and the judge was bound to make findings on whether  or  not  the
marriage was genuine. It was clear that the judge had been  aware  that  the
previous determinations related to different  issues  but  was  entitled  to
take account of the credibility issues raised which had not been  explained.


8. With respect to the issue of the sponsor's earnings,  different  evidence
had been given and the difficulty for the judge was that  he  had  not  been
given a clear picture due to the contradictory evidence. In  any  event,  Ms
Everett submitted that this point was immaterial if the judge's findings  on
the relationship were upheld.

9. Mr Shah replied. He submitted that too much weight had been given by  the
judge to the previous determinations. The appeal should be allowed  outright
due to the evidence adduced on both  the  issue  of  the  marriage  and  the
sponsor's work.

10. That  completed  submissions.  At  the  conclusion  of  the  hearing,  I
reserved my determination which I now give with reasons.

Discussion and Conclusions

11. I have considered all the evidence before me and have had regard to  the
submissions made.

12. It is now accepted by Mr Shah that the judge did not err in  determining
the issue of whether or not the relationship was  genuine.  The  matter  was
raised by the Presenting  Officer  at  the  hearing  before  the  First-tier
Tribunal  and  there  was   no   objection   raised   by   the   appellant's
representative.  Cross  examination  took  place  on  the  issue.   Clearly,
therefore, the judge was required to consider the matter and it  would  have
been an error of law had he not done so. What is now argued instead, by  way
of an amendment to  the  grounds,  is  that  the  judge's  findings  on  the
marriage were flawed. It is maintained that he did not give  due  weight  to
the other evidence of the relationship, that he placed too much emphasis  on
the failure of the appellant and the sponsor  to  attend  an  interview  and
that he considered previous determinations when they related to other  types
of applications. I now consider the judge's findings  on  the  marriage  and
relationship.

13. The judge set out all the evidence considered  at  paragraph  4  of  the
determination. He also set out the oral evidence of the  appellant  and  all
the witnesses. In assessing the evidence as a whole, he took account of  the
previous determinations as they formed part of the  appellant's  background.
He was entitled to do so following Deevaseelan [2002] UKIAT 000702.  He  was
well aware that the three determinations related to  a  student  application
and to two EEA applications as an extended family member (at 111) and I  see
no merit in the argument that he erred in taking these  determinations  into
account or that he placed undue weight on them.  The  discrepancies  arising
at previous hearings with respect to the relationship between the  appellant
and the sponsor are relevant to the claim  that  the  same  relationship  is
ongoing, albeit a marriage has since taken place.

14.  The  judge  noted  that  the  evidence  before   him   gave   rise   to
contradictions over when  the  couple  began  cohabiting,  the  relationship
between  the  appellant  and  the  landlord  and  the   occupants   of   the
accommodation allegedly occupied by the appellant and the  sponsor  (at  98-
99). The evidence of the appellant and sponsor  at  a  previous  hearing  on
these very issues and the findings made are therefore directly relevant  and
the judge was entitled to have regard to them. The marriage of  itself  does
not resolve them.

15. Mr Shah also argued that the judge erred in stating  that  marriage  was
not determinative of the issue but of course that was a  fair  approach  (at
104). If marriage in itself was determinative, then  there  would  never  be
any issue of a  marriage  of  convenience  in  any  application  or  appeal.
Marriage is a relevant factor but it is not the only one.  Where  there  are
so many other serious inconsistencies, as there are here,  and  where  there
were also inconsistencies at previous hearings which remain unresolved,  the
judge was entitled to take the view that the  marriage  in  itself  did  not
establish a genuine and subsisting relationship.

16. The judge was also entitled  to  take  account  of  the  fact  that  the
appellant  and  sponsor  declined  to  attend  two  interviews.  Whilst  the
appellant previously claimed through his representatives that it would  take
five hours to get to Liverpool from London and  sought  a  change  of  venue
because they were working, it was accepted by  his  representative  that  in
fact the train from London was a three hour  journey;  it  was  now  argued,
however, that the tickets were too  expensive.   The  judge  considered  the
failure to attend either interview was a point against the appellant and  he
was fully entitled to take that view (at 105 and 115).  Once  the  appellant
had been told his application for a change of venue had  been  rejected,  he
should have attended the second  interview  particularly  if  he  wanted  to
prove his case. There is no authority for  Mr  Shah's  submission  that  the
respondent should have come to the appellant's house instead  nor  does  the
determination indicate that undue weight was put on this point  as  Mr  Shah
argued.

17. The judge also noted that  there  were  language  problems  between  the
appellant and sponsor (at 107).  Certainly,  at  the  earlier  hearing,  the
sponsor could not even understand basic English and as  she  did  not  speak
Urdu and indeed did not even know what the language was called and  used  an
acquaintance as an interpreter, concerns arose as to the genuineness of  the
relationship.

18. Discrepancies over the different faiths of  the  appellant  and  sponsor
and their intentions as to children were also relied on (at 108).

19. The judge took account of the evidence of the other  witnesses  (at  100
and 109). He noted that the appellant's mother-in-law only spoke Polish  and
had never visited the couple at their alleged home so could give  no  direct
evidence as to their living arrangements. It should also be noted  that  the
witness statements given by the sponsor's parents are practically  identical
and contain the same grammatical errors. In  fact,  the  statements  of  the
appellant and sponsor are also almost identical and also  contain  the  same
mistakes. This  does  not  suggest  that  they  were  actually  individually
prepared each witness.

20. For all these reasons, the judge properly concluded  that  the  marriage
was one of convenience and the submissions made in an attempt  to  challenge
that conclusion fail to establish that he erred in any way in reaching  that
conclusion. On that basis alone, the appeal cannot succeed.

21. Nevertheless, I now turn to the second issue; whether the sponsor  is  a
qualified  person.  The  judge  was  presented   with   unsatisfactory   and
contradictory evidence and, as Ms Everett submitted, could not be  clear  of
the true situation. I accept  that  it  is  possible  that  the  interpreter
misheard the figure of �17,000 as �70,000 but what is  strange  is  that  Mr
Shah did not seek to clarify that in the re-examination of the  sponsor.  In
any case, there was no documentary evidence to support either  sum.  Indeed,
the sponsor's own documentary evidence for  the  previous  tax  year  showed
earnings of far less and it was not explained  how  she  had  increased  her
income by such a substantial margin. Serious  difficulties  arose  with  her
evidence in the hearing in 2012 when she could not say  where  she  went  to
work, could not describe her place of work, could not name her  boss,  could
not explain the errors with the pay slips and  could  not  explain  why  the
address of the business she allegedly worked  for  did  not  exist  and  the
closest address was a residential property.  The  judge  in  this  instance,
however, does not appear to take those matters into  account  which  further
undermines Mr  Shah's  submission  that  undue  weight  was  placed  on  the
previous determinations.

22.  The  judge  considered  the   documentary   evidence   but   found   it
unsatisfactory (at 117). It has to be said that almost all the  invoices  in
the appellant's bundle are of such poor quality as to be illegible (at  119)
and there is no schedule drawn up to  show  that  payments  received  accord
with the deposits into the sponsor's bank account. Many of the dates on  the
invoices, where legible, have been visibly altered by hand. The judge  noted
there was no evidence to support the oral evidence of the sponsor's  claimed
self employment earnings (at 118-119). It was therefore open to  the  judge,
on that unsatisfactory evidence, to conclude that the appellant  had  failed
to establish that the sponsor was a qualified person.

23. The judge found that the appellant  had  tried  every  possible  way  to
remain. His  credibility  must  be  assessed  in  the  context  of  all  the
evidence, past and present. Previous Tribunals have found  that  neither  he
nor his sponsor are witnesses of truth.  The  appellant  in  fact  initially
sought to remain as a student using falsified documents from  the  Cambridge
College of Learning. He then sought to rely on  his  relationship  with  the
sponsor whom he failed to mention as part of his  initial  application.  The
relationship was not accepted as genuine by two different judges.  Even  now
the difficulties persist. The judge's conclusions  are  sustainable  and  no
errors have been identified.

Decision

24. The First-tier Tribunal did not make any errors of law and the  decision
to dismiss the appeal stands.

Anonymity

25. I have not been asked to make an anonymity order and see  no  reason  to
do so.
