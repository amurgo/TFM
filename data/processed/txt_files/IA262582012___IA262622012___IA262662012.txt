Representation:

For the Appellants:    Mr Paul Turner, direct-access barrister
For the Respondent:    Mr T. Wilding of the Specialist Appeals Team


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   Mr Rehman and Mr Tariq had both spent a number of years in  the  United
    Kingdom, first as students and then as Post-Study Work Migrants, before
    they applied in June 2012 to 'switch' into the  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)
    category as an 'entrepreneurial team'.  At the same time, Mrs  Paracha,
    who is married to Mr Rehman, sought further  leave  to  remain  as  the
    dependant of  a  Relevant  Points  Based  System  Migrant.   All  three
    applications were refused on 6th November 2012, and the  appeals  which
    were subsequently lodged stand or fall together.

2.    Messrs  Rehman  and  Tariq  had  already  started  a  private  limited
    company, Mingle Foods, and  their  applications  were  supported  by  a
    letter dated 11th June 2012 on headed notepaper of  Mingle  Foods  Ltd,
    written by them as directors of the company  and  confirming  that  the
    company's funds were fully  available  to  them  to  invest  in  a  new
    enterprise, Mingle Tech Ltd.  A bank statement for  Mingle  Foods  from
    HSBC was provided, showing a credit balance on 11th  June  of  �51,090.
    The minimum sum needed in order to  switch  from  the  Post-Study  Work
    category to the Entrepreneur category was �50,000.  Documents were also
    enclosed  about  the  newly  incorporated  Mingle  Tech,  including  an
    agreement to provide IT and electrical services to a recruitment agency
    in Slough.

3.   The applications were  refused  because  no  points  were  awarded  for
    Attributes under Appendix A to the Immigration Rules.  Table 4(d)  sets
    out the requirements for  this  class  of  application,  which  include
    having access to no less than �50,000.  On 20th July  2012,  subsequent
    to the joint application by Mr Rehman and Mr Tariq, a new paragraph 41-
    SD was inserted into Appendix  A,  listing  the  "specified  documents"
    which could demonstrate the availability of the necessary  funds.   One
    way of doing this was to provide a letter from a financial institution,
    or a personal bank statement, confirming the amount of money  available
    to the entrepreneurial team.  In the instant case, there was no  letter
    from HSBC, while the HSBC statement fell foul  of  the  requirement  at
    paragraph 41-SD(a)(ii)(4) that the account had to be in  the  names  of
    the applicants, and not in the name of a business or third party.   The
    account here was the business account of Mingle Foods.

4.   The possibility was then explored that Mingle Foods could  be  regarded
    as a 'third party' contributor of funds.  But this fell foul of another
    requirement of paragraph 41-SD, namely that  there  should  be  both  a
    declaration from the third party (41-SD(b)(i))  and  a  letter  from  a
    legal representative (41-SD(b)(ii)).  The letter of 11th June on Mingle
    Foods headed notepaper  counted  as  a  declaration,  but  it  was  not
    accompanied by a letter from a legal representative.

5.   A third reason was then given for refusing the joint  application.   It
    was noted that most of the money deposited in the HSBC account held  by
    Mingle Foods, which had built up the credit balance  to  over  �50,000,
    had been deposited by Mr Rehman and Mr Tariq.  These deposits could, it
    was said, "be classed as funds which have already been invested in  the
    United Kingdom."  But in order  for  the  funds  to  be  accepted,  the
    evidence specified in paragraph 46-SD, such as company accounts and tax
    returns, should have been provided.  This is apparently an allusion  to
    Mingle Foods and the business activity carried on by Messrs Rehman  and
    Tariq while they were Post-Study Work Migrants.  Indeed, it seems  that
    they could have put forward Mingle Foods, rather than Mingle  Tech,  as
    the basis upon which to apply for Entrepreneur status.  But  they  made
    their applications without any professional assistance,  and  by  their
    own admission  did  not  fully  comprehend  the  complexities  of  this
    particular part  of  the  Points-Based  System.   Indeed,  I  have  had
    difficulty grasping it myself.

6.   Not only were the applications to vary  leave  refused,  but  decisions
    were also taken to remove  the  applicants  under  section  47  of  the
    Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.  When  the  three  linked
    appeals came before the First-tier Tribunal on 5th  March  2013,  Judge
    Hubball correctly found at paragraph 28 of his determination  that  the
    removal decisions (he actually uses the  phrase  'removal  directions',
    which had not yet been given) were  unlawful,  but  did  not  expressly
    allow the appeals against those decisions.  A letter  from  HSBC  dated
    29th November 2012 was adduced, providing some of the information whose
    absence led to the applications being refused.   But  the  judge  ruled
    that this evidence was inadmissible under section 85A of the 2002  Act,
    and the appeals against the 'variation' decisions were dismissed.

7.   Permission was sought to appeal to the Upper Tribunal, on  the  footing
    that the Border Agency should  have  contacted  the  applicants  before
    deciding their applications and  asked  them  to  provide  the  missing
    documentation, in line with  the  policy  of  'evidential  flexibility'
    examined in  Rodriguez  (Flexibility  Policy)  [2013]  UKUT  42  (IAC).
    Permission was initially refused by Designated Judge Garratt,  but  was
    granted on renewal by Upper Tribunal Judge Perkins.   When  the  matter
    came before me, Mr Turner expanded upon the grounds of appeal which had
    impressed Judge Perkins, and was resisted by Mr Wilding.  I am grateful
    to both representatives for the skill  and  lucidity  with  which  they
    presented their  submissions,  in  a  case  of  considerable  technical
    difficulty.  Having pondered long over those  submissions,  I  can  now
    give my determination in quite a brief compass.

8.   The First-tier Tribunal did err in law, in my view,  by  not  adverting
    to the 'evidential flexibility' policy.  Rodriguez  had  been  reported
    several weeks before these appeals were heard,  and  should  have  been
    taken into account.  Despite a persuasive rebuttal  by  Mr  Wilding,  I
    find myself in agreement with the  contention  made  by  Mr  Turner  at
    paragraphs 13 to 27 of his Grounds.  The parties already have them, and
    I need not recapitulate them here.  I would add that  this  was  not  a
    situation where the caseworker was unaware of the policy.  He must have
    been aware of it, for at two points in the refusal letters he considers
    whether he should contact the applicants and ask for certain documents,
    but decides not to.   These  were,  however,  applications  which  were
    crying out for the policy to be applied.  The applications had not been
    prepared by lawyers, but on their face it was  clear  enough  that  the
    applicants were genuine entrepreneurs, the  kind  of  people  that  the
    Points Based System is supposed to encourage.  All that was needed  was
    some tidying up of the paperwork.

9.   Not only was the policy engaged, as explained in Rodriguez, but  common
    law fairness required that the applicants be contacted and  told  about
    the documents that were missing.  The applications were  made  on  13th
    June 2012, and it was not until 20th July that  paragraph  41-SD,  with
    all its documentary requirements, was  inserted  into  the  Immigration
    Rules.  Previously, the 'specified documents' had been listed in Policy
    Guidance, which was not  binding.   When  the  provision  of  specified
    documents suddenly became  binding,  in  the  wake  of  Alvi,  fairness
    required that applications which were already  pending  should  not  be
    refused because specified documents were  missing.   Fairness  required
    that  such  applicants  be  given  the  opportunity  of  supplying  the
    specified documents.

10.  As for the policy itself, the panel in  Rodriguez  did  not  express  a
    view on whether the 'evidential flexibility' policy outside the  Rules,
    to which they had ascribed a very wide ambit, had continued beyond  6th
    September 2012, when paragraph  245AA  was  inserted  into  the  Rules,
    arguably incorporating into the Rules a much restricted version of  the
    policy described in Rodriguez.  But in any event, the full-blown policy
    had been in force for  three  months  after  the  applications  in  the
    present case were made, giving plenty of time for  the  application  of
    that policy.  It is expected  that  the  Upper  Tribunal  will  shortly
    determine an application by the Secretary of State for leave to  appeal
    Rodriguez to the Court of Appeal, but unless and until it is overturned
    I should follow a 'reported' case of the Upper Tribunal, especially one
    written by the future President of the Chamber.




     DECISION

     The appeals against the refusal  to  vary  leave  are  allowed  to  the
    limited extent that the decisions were not in accordance with the  law.
    The applications for further leave to remain are therefore  outstanding
    before the Secretary of State, and are to be determined in the light of
    the evidence provided by the appellants of their current circumstances.

     The decisions to remove the appellants under section  47  of  the  2006
    Act are also allowed, as those decisions were not  in  accordance  with
    the law as it was at the time.
