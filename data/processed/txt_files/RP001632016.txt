                            DECISION AND REASONS

       This is an appeal, by the , against the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Manjit Obhi), sitting at Birmingham on 21 March, to   a
    revocation of protection appeal by  a  citizen  of  Pakistan,  born  27
    August 1997. The appellant had arrived as a visitor with his family  on
    18 June 2009, and on 6 August that  year  his  mother  claimed  asylum,
    which was granted her and her dependants on 14 December, till 2014.

 2. By then this appellant had not only been found  guilty  of  robbery  in
    2013, for which he received a referral order, but on 23 May  2014  been
    sentenced after trial to six years' detention for an offence, committed
    on 18 July 2013, of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm,
    contrary to s. 18 of the Offences against the Person Act  1861.  On  19
    September 2014  that  sentence  was  reduced  to  one  of  four  years'
    detention by the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division).



 3. On 10 November 2016, following the usual notices, the  respondent  gave
    notice of her decision to revoke the appellant's refugee status, refuse
    his human rights claim, and deport him. Following the dismissal of  his
    appeal, permission to appeal was given by the Upper Tribunal on grounds
    (a) (not taking account of the reasons behind  the  Court  of  Appeal's
    reduction of the sentence, and what  effect  they  might  have  on  the
    remarks of the sentencing judge); and (c) (not taking account of the up-
    to-date probation report (14 March 2017).

 4. The appellant was perhaps rather lucky to get permission on ground (a),
    as his representatives had not taken the trouble to put  the  Court  of
    Appeal's reasoned judgment before the judge; nor was it before me  when
    I first sat to hear this case on 17 October. It should be  routine  for
    the Home Office to provide such judgments as part of the appeal bundle;
    but, if they do not, it is the  responsibility  of  those  representing
    appellants to do so. As a result of directions I gave, the judgment was
    provided, and so ground (a) can now be dealt with properly.

 5. The facts which led to the appellant's sentence were these. He had been
    unhappy about pictures put into circulation by  the  victim,  much  the
    same age as him, showing him being 'happy-slapped' by  the  same  young
    man. The appellant had arranged a meeting between his own gang and  the
    victim's: at first nothing untoward happened. Then the  appellant  rang
    his co-defendant, a little older, to come and join them. Next,  in  the
    words of the sentencing judge, he lured the victim over to  talk;  then
    the co-defendant arrived, armed with a kitchen knife, and  stabbed  the
    victim in the chest. As the judge said,  the  stab  could  easily  have
    penetrated into a vital organ: this was "... a deliberate stabbing  and
    inflicted with the clearest of intentions to  cause  a  really  serious
    injury". Finally the appellant took the knife from his co-defendant  to
    have a go himself, but the victim escaped back to his friends, where he
    collapsed.

 6. The sentencing judge had to deal not only with the appellant,  who  had
    stood trial, but with his co-defendant, who had  pled  guilty  about  a
    fortnight before it began. The co-defendant had asked  for  a  Goodyear
    ([2005] EWCA Crim 888) indication from another judge,  before  whom  he
    had appeared, and been told that the starting-point would be a sentence
    of six years' imprisonment. As well  as  changing  his  plea,  the  co-
    defendant had given a witness statement to the police, and  offered  to
    give evidence at the trial.

 7. The sentencing judge agreed with that starting-point, on the basis that
    this was a borderline category 1 or 2 s. 18 offence, with a high  level
    of culpability, but, more by luck than design, lesser harm done, in the
    context of an offence of that kind. With  25%  discount  for  his  late
    plea, the co-defendant received 4� years' imprisonment: in his case, he
    had also had a previous referral order, and was 17 at the date  of  the
    offence, by the time he was sentenced 18.

 8. This appellant, 15 at the date of the offence, and still only  16  when
    sentenced, got six years. The Court of Appeal considered the sentencing
    guidelines for s. 18 offences, and took the view that  the  judge  must
    have taken the appropriate starting-point for a grown-up after trial in
    this case as one of eight or nine years' imprisonment.

 9.  It  followed  that  the  sentencing  judge  must  have  intended  this
    appellant's six-year sentence to reflect an  appropriate  discount  for
    his age, which could have been no  more  than  25%  (on  an  eight-year
    sentence) or at most 33% (starting  from  nine  years).  The  Court  of
    Appeal went on to consider the youth sentencing guidelines, and reached
    this conclusion:

       ... having had due regard to the terms of the pre-sentence report and
       the way that [the] judge assessed [the appellant],  having  seen  him
       during a trial and, in particular, his recognition of his age and his
       immaturity, that discount was insufficient and resulted in a sentence
       which was manifestly excessive and also one which read  rather  oddly
       with the sentence imposed on [the co-defendant] ...

10. Having applied what they considered the appropriate discount, the Court
    of Appeal reduced  this  appellant's  sentence  to  one  of  4�  years'
    detention. The question on ground (a) is what effect their reasons  for
    that had on the validity of those given by Judge Obhi on  this  appeal.
    There was no complaint in the grounds as to any specific finding by the
    judge, but merely a general challenge to  her  general  observation  at
    paragraph 28:

       I place a great  deal  of  weight  on  the  impression  made  by  the
       appellant on the sentencing judge who had heard him and seen him over
       the course of the trial.

    A general suggestion was made at paragraph 9 of the  grounds  that  the
    judge's sentencing remarks were 'overturned' by the Court of Appeal. As
    already noted, the passage in the judgment  cited  at  9  did  no  such
    thing: the Court of  Appeal,  like  Judge  Obhi,  gave  weight  to  the
    impression made by the appellant on the sentencing judge, who had  seen
    and heard him for himself.

11. There were obvious reasons, especially in  terms  of  this  appellant's
    age, and the potential disparity with the sentence passed  on  his  co-
    defendant, for the Court of Appeal to reduce his sentence.  Their  only
    other specific point on the sentencing remarks, which was also taken up
    by  Mr  Raza,  was  on  that  judge's  reference  to  the   appellant's
    immaturity. Judge Obhi  dealt  in  some  detail  with  the  appellant's
    attitude to his offence at paragraph 23, and it is  worth  setting  out
    what she said:

       The trial judge had no doubt that the appellant ... intended to  stab
       the victim and he was saved  only  to  run  to  the  company  of  his
       friends, where he  collapsed  and  was  put  into  the  care  of  the
       emergency services. The appellant shows  little  actual  remorse  for
       what he has done. He expresses remorse but his statement concentrates
       on the impact on him. There is no understanding of the impact on  the
       victim. He believes that he has already been punished for his offence
       and sending him back to Pakistan would be further punishment.

12. This might well be described as an immature attitude;  but,  as  events
    showed, the appellant's immaturity had not stopped him from  committing
    a planned offence of serious violence. There is nothing in the Court of
    Appeal's judgment to cast any doubt on the trial judge's view,  as  set
    out in the first sentence of Judge  Obhi's  remarks,  just  cited,  and
    certainly no error of law in her part in relying on it; so  ground  (a)
    fails.





13. The question on ground (c) turns on the 2017 probation report, and  how
    Judge Obhi dealt with it, in terms of the appellant's present attitude,
    including the rest of the passage just set out, where  she  is  clearly
    describing the position at the date of the hearing before  her.  Rather
    annoyingly, the report-writer has followed Home Office practice in  not
    numbering paragraphs, so I have done it for myself.

14. The passage in the report relied  on  in  the  grounds  is  this  (from
    paragraph 13, the last on p 2):

       It is my assessment,  in  the  here  and  now,  [the  appellant]  has
       demonstrated  high  levels  of  remorse.  His  attitude   is   highly
       suggestive of change where he has attempted to engage  with  services
       to better his situation such as education, employment  and  training.
       His  family  remain  actively  supportive  in  the  community,   both
       emotionally  and  financially.  There  is  no  evidence  at   present
       suggesting he is engaging in reckless behaviour in the community.

15. At paragraph 26 Judge Obhi set out a passage, also from the 2017 report
    (at paragraphs 6 - 7, on pp 1 - 2), and to similar effect:

       [The appellant] during the commission of the offence and at the point
       of Sentence, struggled to comprehend the severity of the  matter  and
       therefore struggled to accept responsibility.

       Since his time in custody and release from  Prison,  [the  appellant]
       has expressed remorse for the offence and now understands the  impact
       of the offence upon the victim and accepts full responsibility.

16. What Judge Obhi is criticized for is (as the anonymous draftsman of the
    grounds, not Mr Raza) put it, is "... brusquely reject[ing] a report of
    a professional who is trained to assess risk of recidivism". This takes
    no account of the numerous points  in  the  appellant's  favour,  which
    Judge Obhi went on to note at paragraph 26. At 28 she reaches  her  own
    conclusion:

       The report of the probation officer tells me that  the  GBH  occurred
       after the appellant had been to the Mosque. Whilst I am told that the
       appellant has expressed remorse for the offence, I see little of that
       in his oral evidence or in  his  statement.  The  statements  of  the
       appellant and his family and friends  are  focused  entirely  on  the
       appellant  and  his  interests,  there  is   no   evidence   of   any
       understanding of the impact of his actions on his victim.

17. Judge Obhi's reference to the mosque made it clear that  she  has  read
    and considered the following passage, at paragraphs 3 - 4 of  the  2017
    report:

       ... [The appellant] was out with a group of approximately  8  friends
       around his own age. He had met up with members of his group following
       him attending Mosque during  Ramadan.  ...  They  arrived  at  a  ...
       restaurant ... and saw the victim who was known to  [the  appellant].
       The victim beckoned  him  over  and  'bumped  fists'  in  a  friendly
       greeting. The victim also greeted the other members of the group in a
       friendly manner. Shortly after this [the  co-defendant]  arrived  and
       greeted everyone there, shaking their hands with the exception of the
       victim. [The appellant] states [the co-defendant]  then  walked  away
       with the victim talking as they went.

       The victim was then stabbed and began to run away, he was pursued  by
       [the co-defendant] and the others there all followed. [The appellant]
       explained this was to see what was  happening.  The  following  group
       then noticed blood on the T shirt of the victim and  ran  away.  [The
       appellant] also ran away and  noticed  that  [the  co-defendant]  had
       disappeared. [The appellant] and the other members of the group  were
       arrested later the same evening and all were charged under the  joint
       enterprise law of wounding with intent to cause GBH ...

18. This was obviously the appellant's own account to the probation officer
    who wrote the 2017 report. It is only necessary to compare it with  the
    summary at 5 (all taken from the sentencing judge's remarks) to see how
    far it is from the version of events accepted by the jury, and how very
    far this appellant still is from acknowledging his  own  responsibility
    for what happened.  Instead  of  taking  the  blame  for  planning  and
    encouraging a most serious offence of violence, and showing every  sign
    of wanting to follow suit himself, the  appellant  has  chosen  to  put
    forward an account of innocently meeting the victim when out for a meal
    with friends after the Ramadan fast, and finding himself  charged  with
    wounding with intent, simply because he had been present when  his  co-
    defendant stabbed him. Judge Obhi was abundantly justified in the  view
    she took at 28, and ground (c) fails too.

19. That means the appeal must be dismissed; but it may be worth  referring
    to the legal basis for Judge Obhi's decision, though no point  on  that
    was taken in the grounds or before  me.  This  appellant,  having  been
    recognized as a  refugee  as  his  mother's  dependant,  could  not  be
    deported following  his  conviction,  unless  (see  Refugee  Convention
    article 33 (1), and Qualification Directive article 21.2  (b)  "he  ...
    having been convicted by a final judgment  of  a  particularly  serious
    crime, constitutes a danger to the community ...". By s. 72 (2) of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002

      A person shall be presumed to have been convicted by a final judgment
      of a particularly serious crime and to constitute a danger to the
      community of the United Kingdom if he is-

      (a) convicted in the United Kingdom of an offence, and

      (b) sentenced to a period of imprisonment of at least two years.

20. 'Imprisonment', by s. 72 (11) (b) (ii), includes detention,  and  there
    are similar provisions in article 14.4 of the Qualification  Directive,
    allowing member states to revoke refugee status. This appellant  is  to
    be presumed to constitute a danger to the community; however,  that  is
    subject to the reading down of that presumption, based on the terms  of
    article 21.2 of the Qualification Directive, to be found in  IH  (s.72;
    'Particularly Serious Crime') Eritrea [2009] UKAIT  00012.  This  makes
    the presumption rebuttable; so the question for the judge on  the  part
    of the appeal in question was whether this appellant had satisfied  her
    on the balance of probabilities  that  he  was  not  a  danger  to  the
    community.

21. The judge set out the effect of s. 72, as relied on by the  respondent,
    at paragraph 21, and was clearly well aware of its  provisions,  though
    she dealt with the appeal against deportation in  terms  of  paragraphs
    398 - 399A of the Immigration Rules, and s. 117C  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. It is perfectly clear  from  what  she
    said, and with full justification,  as  already  explained,  about  the
    appellant's attitude to his offence, that he had not satisfied her that
    he was not a danger to the community.


22. So far as the provisions referred to by the judge are  concerned,  both
    s. 117C (6) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and the
    corresponding parts of the Rules made it clear that the public interest
    required  this  appellant's  deportation,  unless  there   were   'very
    compelling circumstances' over and above those set out under Exceptions
    1 and 2.

23. Exception 2 did not apply here, since the appellant  has  no  child  or
    partner in this country; and neither  did  Exception  1.  Each  of  its
    requirements must be satisfied for it  to  apply,  and  the  judge  was
    satisfied, for reasons she gave at 27, that none of them did.  Even  if
    permission had been given to challenge her findings on this  point,  it
    is beyond argument that this appellant, not quite 12 when he came here,
    and still only 19 at the date of the hearing, though 20  now,  had  not
    been 'lawfully resident in the United Kingdom for most of his life'; so
    Exception  1  cannot  apply  either.  As  for  there  being  any  'very
    compelling circumstances' over and above those set out in Exceptions  1
    and 2, no such argument was put forward in the grounds, or  before  me,
    nor could it have been with any possible hope of success.
