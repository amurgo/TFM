                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. These are a written record of the oral reasons given for my decision at
    the hearing.

Introduction

 2. This is an appeal by the appellant against the decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Dorrington, (the 'FtT'), promulgated on 5 June 2019,  by
    which he dismissed the  appellant's  appeal  against  the  respondent's
    refusal on 5 October 2018 of his application for  entry  clearance  for
    settlement, to join  his  son  and  sponsor,  as  the  adult  dependent
    relative  (the  74-year  old  widower  father)  of  the  sponsor.   The
    respondent had maintained her initial refusal of entry clearance in  an
    entry clearance manager ('ECM') review decision dated 8 February 2019.

 3. The scope of the issues is in dispute.  The  appellant  says  that  the
    respondent's refusal was solely on the basis that the appellant  failed
    to meet the requirement of section  E-ECDR.2.5(b)  of  the  Immigration
    Rules, i.e. the appellant was unable, even with the financial  help  of
    the sponsor, to obtain the required level of care in India,  where  the
    appellant is resident, because such  care  is  "not  affordable."   The
    appellant refers to the documents submitted with  his  application  for
    entry clearance, which refer to the sponsor's limited  financial  means
    even to pay for the existing level of care,  let  alone  the  increased
    level  of  care  said  to  be  necessary  because  the  appellant   has
    Alzheimer's disease.

 4. The respondent's refusal decision referred to  sub-sections  E-ECDR-2.1
    to .2.5 more generally, but then specifically referred to the  lack  of
    evidence said to support the sponsor's assertion that he was no  longer
    able to afford the increased cost of care.  In the ECM's decision,  the
    respondent further referred to the sponsor being  able  to  afford  the
    level of care (although whether this is the existing or increased level
    of care is unclear) and the sponsor's savings in excess of ï¿½3,000.

The FtT's decision

 5. The FtT accepted the deterioration in  the  appellant's  health  ([38])
    would necessitate an increase in nursing costs from the  8  hours  each
    day to 24 hour/ 7 day week provision, but the FtT did not  accept  that
    alternative healthcare providers would not be willing  to  provide  the
    appellant's care more cheaply, in the absence of evidence  of  searches
    by the sponsor about the availability of  providers  and  the  lack  of
    alternative quotes.  The current provider might be very expensive,  and
    the quote was for in-home support, as opposed to residential  care-home
    support, which might be far cheaper.   The  FtT  essentially  concluded
    that the appellant had not demonstrated that cheaper providers could be
    found, as opposed to focussing on the unaffordability  of  his  current
    provider.

 6. The FtT concluded that the appellant's failure to  meet  E-ECDR-2.1  to
    .2.5 in turn  impacted  on  the  proportionality  assessment,  for  the
    purposes of GEN.3.2, as well as a free-standing article  8  assessment,
    and rejected the appellant's appeal.

The grounds of appeal and grant of permission

 7. The appellant lodged grounds of appeal which are essentially  that  the
    FtT went beyond the  scope  the  respondent's  refusal  and  the  ECM's
    decision, in considering E-E-ECDR.2.5(a), as opposed  to  sub-paragraph
    (b), namely the FtT considered whether the required level of  care  was
    not available; as opposed to it being available,  but  not  affordable.
    The respondent had not raised the issue of comparability  of  costs  of
    alternative providers, so that the FtT had  erred  in  making  findings
    which had not been the basis for refusal - see:  IO (Points  in  Issue)
    Nigeria [2004] UKIAT 00179.   The  FtT  further  failed  to  carry  out
    adequately an article 8 assessment.

 8. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  P  Hollingworth  granted  permission  on  2
    September 2019, regarding it as arguable that the FtT had  decided  the
    appeal for reasons not relied on in  the  original  refusals  of  entry
    clearance,  and  there  had  arguably  been  a  failure  to  carry  out
    adequately an article 8 assessment.

The Law

 9. Section E-ECDR provides:

    Section EC-DR: Entry clearance as an adult dependent relative

    EC-DR.1.1. The requirements to be met for entry clearance as  an  adult
    dependent relative are that-

    (a)  the applicant must be outside the UK;

    (b)  the applicant  must  have  made  a  valid  application  for  entry
         clearance as an adult dependent relative;

    (c)  the applicant must not fall for refusal under any of  the  grounds
         in Section S-EC: Suitability for entry clearance; and

    (d)  the applicant must meet all of the requirements of Section E-ECDR:
         Eligibility for entry clearance as an adult dependent relative.

    Section E-ECDR: Eligibility for entry clearance as an  adult  dependent
    relative

    E-ECDR.1.1. To meet the eligibility requirements for entry clearance as
    an adult dependent relative all of the requirements  in  paragraphs  E-
    ECDR.2.1. to 3.2. must be met.

    E-ECDR.2.5. The applicant or, if the applicant and  their  partner  are
    the sponsor's parents or grandparents, the applicant's partner, must be
    unable, even with the practical and financial help of the  sponsor,  to
    obtain the required level of care in the country where they are living,
    because-

    (a)  it is not available and there is no person in that country who can
         reasonably provide it; or

    (b)  it is not affordable.

10. The case of IO (Points in Issue) Nigeria [2004]  UKIAT  00179  includes
    the following guidance at [13]:

         "13. The Tribunal is well aware the entry clearance officers  often
             work under great pressure.   Nevertheless  each  applicant  is
             entitled to a proper decision.  We set out below a summary  of
             the approach that we say  should  be  taken  when  considering
             visitor applications and appeals:

             a)   If entry clearance officers are  not  satisfied  that  an
                  applicant has met the requirements of a particular  clause
                  of rule 41 they must say so clearly and identify the  rule
                  unequivocally, preferably both by its number and a  direct
                  quotation from it.

             b)   Applicants are entitled to assume that their  ability  to
                  satisfy the particular requirements of the rules is not in
                  issue unless the Entry  Clearance  Officers  unequivocally
                  puts it in issue.

             c)   Adjudicators hearing appeals must  decide  the  case  for
                  themselves on the totality of the evidence  but  must  not
                  decide that a requirement of the rules  is  not  satisfied
                  unless the Entry Clearance Officer clearly  said  that  it
                  was  not  satisfied  OR  the  Adjudicator  has  given  the
                  appellant express  notice  that  the  Adjudicator  is  not
                  satisfied that an appellant  can  satisfy  the  particular
                  requirements of a clause of rule 41.

             d)   The injustice to the  appellant  inherent  in  any  delay
                  caused by an adjudicator putting in issue the  appellant's
                  ability to satisfy the requirements of part  of  the  rule
                  that the entry clearance officer did not put in issue will
                  usually be  greater  than  the  injustice  caused  by  the
                  Adjudicator assuming that the entry clearance officer  had
                  good reason for not expressly saying that the requirements
                  of a particular clause were not met."

The hearing before me

The appellant's submissions

11. First of all, Mr Rehman referred to a decision of  the  Upper  Tribunal
    Das Gupta (error of law - proportionality -  correct  approach)  [2016]
    UKUT 00028 (IAC) and in particular paragraph [20] which  suggests  that
    the availability of residential care homes in India  was  more  limited
    than the FtT had concluded.  In any event,  the  FtT's  conclusions  at
    paragraph [54] were speculative and there had been no  evidence  before
    the FtT as to the availability of residential care homes.  Indeed, this
    went to the core of the appeal, as in essence, the appellant  had  come
    to the FtT hearing unprepared for a discussion about  the  availability
    of alternative providers, or more  widely,  care  homes  in  India  and
    having  done  so  the  FtT  effectively  then   speculated   on   their
    availability, which appeared on  the  face  of  it  to  contradict  the
    evidence that had been before the Upper Tribunal in  the  case  of  Das
    Gupta, although as Mr Rehman accepted, it was not  a  country  guidance
    authority on the availability of healthcare in India.  In  reality  the
    whole issue of affordability had been dealt with  by  the  FtT  in  the
    paragraphs leading up to  paragraph  [47],  with  an  analysis  of  the
    limited savings that the sponsor had at [49], which  the  FtT  accepted
    was for emergencies.  Where the FtT had gone outside the scope  of  the
    refusal of entry clearance was  in  his  consideration  of  alternative
    providers at paragraphs [55]  and  [59].   The  sponsor  could  not  be
    criticised for not having brought documents on  alternative  healthcare
    provision, as the FtT sought to criticise him, when he was unaware that
    this would be an issue.  It was also  unsurprising  that  in  his  oral
    evidence, the sponsor had not been able to give precise detail  of  the
    enquiries he had made about alternative providers.




The respondent's submissions

12. Mr Howells made the point that the Presenting Officer  had  raised  the
    issues about the affordability of alternative providers to the  sponsor
    at the FtT hearing although he accepted that the issues  had  not  been
    raised explicitly in the refusal of  entry  clearance  or  in  the  ECM
    review decision.  In the circumstances, the fact that the  sponsor  had
    had the opportunity to comment on the alternative scenario of finding a
    cheaper care home, did not therefore amount to an error of law.

Discussion and conclusions on error of law

13. I accept the  force  of  Mr  Rehman's  submissions,  in  particular  by
    reference to the authority of IO (Points in Issue) Nigeria to  which  I
    have already referred, that the FtT erred in considering an  issue  not
    raised in the refusal or ECM review decisions. As [13(a)] indicates, if
    an Entry Clearance Officer is not satisfied that an applicant  has  met
    the requirements of a particular clause, they must say so  clearly  and
    identify the Rule unequivocally, preferably by both its  number  and  a
    direct quotation from it.  Paragraph 13(b) confirms that applicants are
    entitled to  assume  that  their  ability  to  satisfy  the  particular
    requirements of the  Rules  is  not  in  issue  unless  the  respondent
    unequivocally puts it in issue.  The respondent did  not  unequivocally
    put the matter of alternative  providers  in  issue,  merely  referring
    instead to the availability of funds to pay the existing level of  fees
    from the current provider and the availability of savings.  The FtT did
    not uphold that analysis and  conclusion  and  instead  considered  and
    reached his decision on the separate issue of alternative providers.  I
    conclude that by considering that issue, for which the sponsor and  the
    appellant were unprepared, and which had never been challenged  by  the
    respondent, the FtT erred in law, such that his decision is unsafe  and
    cannot stand.

Disposal

14. Given the narrowness of the factual and legal issues which needed to be
    remade, I regarded it as appropriate and in accordance paragraph 7.2 of
    the Senior President's  Practice  Statement  that  the  Upper  Tribunal
    remade the decision on the appellant's appeal, which I did so and  gave
    an oral decision on the day of the hearing,  the  written  reasons  for
    which are set out below.

The remaking decision

Remaking disposal

15. Both representatives agreed with me two propositions, in  remaking  the
    appeal.  First, the sole basis on which the appellant's application for
    entry clearance had been refused was because it was said  that  he  had
    failed to meet the requirement of section E-ECDR.2.5(b) namely  because
    of  the  affordability  of  healthcare  rather   than   the   lack   of
    availability.  Second, if I were to conclude that the appellant met the
    requirements of section E-ECDR.2.5(b) that would be determinative of an
    article 8 assessment, because  refusal  of  entry  clearance  would  be
    disproportionate.

16. The sole basis of the  respondent's  refusal  of  entry  clearance  was
    because the respondent was not satisfied that the appellant,  with  the
    support of the sponsor, could not afford the cost of  healthcare.   The
    sponsor had provided with the appellant's  application  the  healthcare
    costs of daily care for 8 hours each day; the slim margin by  which  he
    was just about able to afford those costs, which he had  been  able  to
    afford, despite an increase in his mortgage payments,  through  careful
    budgeting, with  savings  of  ï¿½3,000  retained  for  emergencies.   The
    sponsor gave undisputed oral evidence at [38]  about  the  increase  in
    those costs from 10,000 Indian rupees  each  month  (just  over  ï¿½100),
    which  together  with  the  appellant's  rent,   necessitated   monthly
    financial support of ï¿½200, to 40,000 Indian rupees, or more  than  ï¿½400
    each month, with accommodation costs in addition.  He had  only  ï¿½39.53
    remaining each month on the basis of his lower contributions, which  he
    had set out clearly  in  a  budget  sheet  that  he  had  sent  to  the
    respondent prior to her decisions. The content of that budget sheet was
    undisputed, and the only query raised by  the  FtT  had  been  why  the
    appellant's monthly mortgage payments had increased from ï¿½516 to  ï¿½765.
    However, even on the basis of monthly mortgage repayments at  the  date
    of the application of the lower amount,  ï¿½516,  that  still  only  left
    ï¿½39.53 remaining, clearly  not  enough  to  meet  the  additional  ï¿½300
    monthly expense, as a result of 24-hour care.  On the  basis  that  the
    respondent has never raised the  issue  of  cheaper,  alternative  care
    providers as the basis for refusal, and it is clear that the applicant,
    with the assistance of the sponsor, is unable to afford  the  costs  of
    his care with his current provider, I concluded that the appellant does
    meet the requirements of E-ECDR.2.5(b).

17. On an article 8 analysis, both representatives have  conceded  that  if
    the appellant were to meet the Immigration Rules, that the  refusal  of
    entry  clearance  would  be  disproportionate.   I  conclude  that  the
    respondent's refusal of entry clearance, in the  circumstances  and  on
    the evidence available to me, is in breach of  the  appellant's  rights
    under article 8.

Notice of decision

Remaking

18. I therefore remake the appellant's appeal by allowing his appeal.
