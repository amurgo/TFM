                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. I have written this decision following a  resumed  hearing  before  the
    Upper Tribunal at Bradford on 16 November 2015.  By a decision which  I
    promulgated on 10 September 2015 I found that the  First-tier  Tribunal
    had erred in law such that its  decision  fell  to  be  set  aside  and
    directed a resumed hearing before the Upper Tribunal on  Article  15(c)
    grounds only.   My error of law decision is set out below:

 2. The appellant, Elsabir Othman Mohamed El Zawi, born on 2 February  1971
    is a citizen of Libya.  By a  decision  dated  15  December  2014,  the
    appellant is refused asylum and leave to enter the United Kingdom.   He
    appealed to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Batiste)  which,  in  a
    decision promulgated on 24 February 2015, dismissed  the  appeal.   The
    appellant now appeals, with permission, to the Upper Tribunal.

 3. I find that the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  should  be  set
    aside.  I have reached that decision for the  following  reasons.   The
    appeal to the Upper Tribunal concerns the  decision  of  Judge  Batiste
    only insofar as humanitarian protection is  concerned.   The  appellant
    had sought to argue that the background information regarding Libya had
    altered since the promulgation (on 14  July  2014)  of  AT  and  Others
    (Article 15c; risk categories) CG [2014] UKUT 318 (IAC).  Material  was
    put before Judge Batiste by Counsel for the appellant at  that  hearing
    (Miss S Khan) which, she argued, indicated that the appellant would  be
    exposed to indiscriminate violence in a  situation  of  internal  armed
    conflict (Article 15(c)).  Considering her  submission,  Judge  Batiste
    wrote:

    40.  I have gone on to consider the appellant's claim  under  15(c)  of
         the Qualification Directive and in AT and Others it was found there
         is not such a high level of indiscriminate violence in Libya so  as
         to mean that  substantial  grounds  exist  for  believing  that  an
         individual would, solely by being present there, face a  real  risk
         which threatens his life or person.  Given that this is  a  country
         guidance case I am bound to follow this case unless I am  satisfied
         that the circumstances have materially changed since  the  time  of
         the decision.  Miss Khan argues on behalf  of  the  appellant  that
         there has been a material change in the situation.

    41.  In support of this contention she places reliance on the bundle or
         background material .... of  the  appellant's  bundle.   [Ms  Khan]
         directed me to a number of specific paragraphs within this material
         which I have carefully considered.  I accept that these  show  that
         there has been a deterioration in the situation since  the  hearing
         of AT and Others in November 2013.  In particular  I  accept  there
         has been an increase in volatility caused by the  rise  of  Islamic
         State in Libya.  I also accept there has been evidence of  fighting
         in specific towns, including Tripoli  and  Benghazi  and  a  rising
         level of militia control of certain regions.  There has  also  been
         considerable levels of  internal  displacement,  particularly  from
         Tripoli  and  some  surrounding  districts.   I  have   also   seen
         documentation confirming  that  Norway  has  temporarily  suspended
         returns to Libya.

 4. The parties do not dispute that the judge has, in the passage  which  I
    have quoted, set  out  accurately  the  issue  which  was  before  him.
    However, the judge's analysis and the reasons which he  has  given  for
    his determination of  the  issue  of  humanitarian  protection  was  as
    follows:

    42.  However, having considered all the evidence before me I cannot  be
         satisfied that the evidence enables me to  be  satisfied  that  the
         situation now is that there is serious and individual threat  to  a
         civilian's life or person by reason of indiscriminate violence in a
         situation of internal armed conflict.  As a result I do not  accept
         the current situation  engages  Article  15(c)  and  I  follow  the
         guidance in the case of AT and  Others.   I  therefore  reject  the
         appellant's claim for requiring international protection.

 5. I find that that paragraph is inadequate  and  does  not  constitute  a
    proper reasoned rejection of Miss Khan's submission.  I have  no  doubt
    that Judge Batiste "considered all the evidence" before him but he  has
    failed to explain exactly what it was in that evidence  which  has  led
    him to his conclusion.  Indeed, had he reached the converse  conclusion
    "having considered all the evidence" before him but without giving  any
    other more specific reasons, such a conclusion would have been  equally
    unsustainable.  The judge did not have to deal in detail with each  and
    every item of the material put before him but he did  need  to  explain
    what it was in the material which led him to reject the  Article  15(c)
    claim.  Further, he needed to  explain  why  he  chose  to  follow  the
    guidance of AT and Others and that very guidance was  being  challenged
    by the appellant.

 6. I do not say that the appellant will necessarily succeed in his Article
    15(c) appeal but I do consider that the Upper  Tribunal  will  need  to
    examine in greater detail all the material (including any new  material
    and expert evidence, should the appellant seek to rely on it) in  order
    to determine  whether  this  particular  appellant  should  be  granted
    protection.  The resumed hearing will take place at Bradford  before  a
    panel of the Upper Tribunal.  Both parties must ensure that they  serve
    each other and file at the Tribunal copies of all evidence  upon  which
    they seek to rely no later than ten working days prior to  the  resumed
    hearing.  The findings of fact of the First-tier Tribunal have not been
    challenged insofar as they relate to the asylum  and  Article  3,  ECHR
    appeal and those findings shall stand.  The  resumed  hearing  will  be
    concerned with the Article 15(c) appeal only.

Notice of Decision

 7. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal which  was  promulgated  on  24
    February 2015 is set aside.  The findings of  fact  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal are preserved insofar as they concern the appeal on asylum and
    Article 3, ECHR grounds.  The Upper Tribunal will remake  the  decision
    on Article 15(c) grounds only following  a  resumed  hearing  before  a
    panel of the Upper Tribunal sitting at Bradford.

 8. No anonymity direction is made.




 9. Ms Khan, for the appellant, acknowledged that the  starting  point  for
    the Upper Tribunal determination of this appeal is the country guidance
    case of AT and Others (Article 15(c); risk categories) Libya CG  [2014]
    UKUT 00318 (IAC).  The Tribunal stated at head note (2):

   Article 15(c)

   (2)    There is not such a  high  level  of  indiscriminate  violence  in
       Libya, within the meaning of  Article  15(c)  of  Council  Directive
       2004/83/EC ("the  Qualification  Directive")  so  as  to  mean  that
       substantial grounds exist for believing that  an  individual  would,
       solely by being present there, face a real risk which threatens  his
       or her life or person.




10. The appellant does not fall into any of the risk  categories  otherwise
    identified in AT.  The question  before  the  Upper  Tribunal  in  this
    appeal is whether country circumstances in Libya have  deteriorated  to
    such a point that the appellant would now be at risk of  indiscriminate
    violence upon return to that country.  I  have  quoted  above  (see  my
    error of law decision) at paragraphs [41] of Judge  Batiste's  decision
    promulgated on 10 September 2015.  That paragraph  provides  a  helpful
    summary of the changes which Ms Khan submits  have  led  to  levels  of
    indiscriminate violence rising considerably within Libya since  AT  was
    promulgated.  In particular, terrorist group commonly known as  Islamic
    State was not present in Libya at the time of the promulgation of AT.

11. I also acknowledge that the political and security situation  in  Libya
    has clearly  deteriorated  as  a  direct  consequence  of  the  growing
    influence of the presence of Islamic State in that country, much of the
    background  material  which  has  been  produced  by  the   appellant's
    solicitors deals in fairly generalised terms with the  threat  to  non-
    combatant civilians in  Libya.   There  are  Swiss  and  American  news
    reports in the  appellant's  latest  bundle  of  documents  which  give
    details  of  the  ill-treatment  and  murder  of  civilians  by  groups
    purporting to represent the government of Libya whilst it  is  apparent
    that there is no centralised government now within the country rather a
    number of heavily armed antagonistic factions, including Islamic State.
     The news reports per se paint a distressing picture  of  the  life  of
    ordinary civilians within  Libya  but  they  do  not,  in  my  opinion,
    establish that this appellant will  face  the  risk  of  indiscriminate
    violence  upon  return  to  the  country.   For  that  reason,  I  have
    considered the evidence specific to the appellant and which appears  in
    the form of expert report  of  Dr  Emil  Joffe  who  is  an  affiliated
    lecturer at the Department of Politics and International Studies in the
    University of Cambridge.  Dr Joffe is an acknowledged expert  on  Libya
    who produced expert evidence before the Tribunal in AT.   I  note  that
    Professor Joffe was alone amongst the experts reporting  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal in AT taking the view that "there was a risk of being affected
    by indiscriminate violence" in Libya [121].  However, his evidence  was
    insufficient to persuade the Tribunal.  Indeed, the Tribunal  took  the
    view [125] that whilst

         it is undeniably the case that many  civilians  -  men,  women  and
         children - have been injured or lost their lives  in  revolutionary
         and post-revolutionary Libya ... we are not satisfied the  evidence
         demonstrates there is such a high level of indiscriminate  violence
         that substantial grounds exist for  believing  that  an  individual
         would, solely by reason of being present there, face  a  real  risk
         which threatens his life or person."  [125]

    The background material which I have been shown in the  instant  appeal
    falls into the same category of that examined by the Tribunal in AT but
    which, likewise, did not lead it to conclude that Article  15(c)  would
    be engaged.  It was also clear that Dr Joffe's  conclusion  that  there
    would be a risk of indiscriminate violence in Libya was  influenced  by
    his opinion that that violence is  essentially  unpredictable,  a  view
    rejected by the Tribunal [127]:

       Whilst we accept that there is some foundation for Professor Joff�'s
       assessment of the violence as being unpredictable, with  respect  to
       him we do not agree that predictability (or lack of it) is a measure
       of indiscriminate violence. Unpredictability may often be a  feature
       of indiscriminate violence, but that does not assist in terms of  an
       assessment of whether there is, in fact, indiscriminate violence  of
       the necessary character  which  requires  recognition  in  terms  of
       international  protection.  To  take  two  simple  illustrations  at
       opposite ends of the spectrum; it may be predictable that every  day
       for several hours opposing factions in an  internal  armed  conflict
       will bomb each other's positions  which  are  in  heavily  built  up
       civilian areas. That violence is predictable  but  would  appear  to
       have the character of indiscriminate violence necessary for  Article
       15(c). At the other extreme, there may be a  bomb  blast  every  few
       months in a market but the timing of it is unpredictable. We do  not
       consider that that type of violence in a situation of internal armed
       conflict would amount  to  indiscriminate  violence  within  Article
       15(c).




12. Given that the  appellant  in  the  present  appeal  submits  that  the
    situation in Libya has now deteriorated to such a degree that he  would
    be at risk of indiscriminate violence, it is perhaps surprising that Dr
    Joffe's report (which is dated 6 November 2015) does  little  to  offer
    unequivocal support for that argument.  At [115], Dr Joffe writes:

         I understand from the decision of Upper Tribunal Judge  Clive  Lane
         that the resumed hearing in Mr El Zawi's appeal will  be  concerned
         with the issue of whether,  under  Article  15(c)  of  the  Council
         Qualification Directive  (2011/95/EU)  (EASO  2015)  the  level  of
         violence and insecurity in Libya today  exceeds  the  threshold  of
         indiscriminate violence, as laid down in the Directive, such as  to
         represent a threat to civilians there.  I am not in a  position  to
         make an authoritative evaluation as to whether or not  the  current
         state of insecurity exceeds this threshold as  defined  by  Article
         15(c) and as laid down in the  latest  country  guidance  on  Libya
         (AT).  However, from a layman's point of view, I  will  argue  that
         violence in Libya is indeed "indiscriminate" and  that  the  Libyan
         state cannot offer its citizens any protection against  it.   After
         all, today seven per cent (431,000 persons  out  of  Libya's  total
         population of 6,000,000) are internally-displaced, 24,400  of  them
         in Awbari and Ghat alone, out of a total population there of 57,000
         - 43 per cent! (UNHCR 2015b).

13. It is not clear  to  me  why  Dr  Joffe  backed  away  from  making  an
    "authoritative evaluation" as to whether the threshold of Article 15(c)
    violence has now been crossed in Libya;  that  evaluation  was  exactly
    what he has been instructed to undertake as an expert witness.   It  is
    possible that he is not required to make a judicial finding  but  that,
    with respect, is obvious.  What is most puzzling is Dr Joffe's  use  of
    the expression "from a layman's point of  view";  Dr  Joffe's  role  in
    these proceedings is not that of a layman offering an  uninformed  view
    but rather of an expert who alone is able to  offer  an  opinion  as  a
    witness rather than to relate facts.  It is  true  that  in  subsequent
    paragraphs Dr Joffe goes on to discuss the macro-political situation in
    Libya (existence of  "two  governments"  both  illegitimate)  but  this
    analysis does not descend to the level of detail required to  establish
    the existence of indiscriminate violence.   Likewise,  his  pessimistic
    view of the future [121] and his somewhat generalised  assessment  that
    "Libya, in short, is not 'safe' in any ordinary sense of the word" does
    little to assist the appellant.

14. I am reminded that the burden of proof in the appeal continues to  rest
    on the appellant.  His evidence consists of background  material  which
    provides details of incidents in which civilians have suffered or  been
    killed and the report of Dr Joffe  refrains  from  offering  an  expert
    opinion.  I find that the appellant has failed to discharge the  burden
    of proving the country situation in Libya has deteriorated to  such  an
    extent that the conclusions of AT are no longer valid and that he would
    face indiscriminate violence anywhere within that  country.   For  that
    reason, I remake the decision dismissing his appeal on all grounds.

Notice of Decision

The appellant's appeal against the  decision  of  the  respondent  dated  15
December 2014 is dismissed.
