Representation:

For the Appellants:    Mr Deller
For the Respondent:    Ms Lovejoy


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State; however I shall  refer  to
    the parties as they were before the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. The first Appellant, Mr Shah, (hereafter simply 'the Appellant')  is  a
    citizen of Pakistan born in 1980.   The second Appellant, born in 1989,
    is his wife.  She is dependent on his appeal.

 3. Mr Shah appealed against a decision of the Secretary of State  made  on
    25 March 2013 to refuse to vary his leave to  remain.   Also,  to  give
    directions for removal under section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum  and
    Nationality Act 2006.

 4. The history is that the Appellant entered the UK  in  April  2007  with
    leave as a student valid until December 2007.  He received an extension
    of leave as a student until April 2010.  He was  then  granted  further
    leave to remain as a Tier 1 (Post-Study Work) Migrant until 19 November
    2012.  His wife arrived in March 2011 and was granted leave to enter as
    a Tier 1 (Post study) Partner until November 2012.

 5. On 14 November 2012 he made a combined application for leave to  remain
    as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant under the Points Based  System,  and
    for a Biometric Residence Permit.

 6. The application of Mr Shah was refused and that of his wife in line.

 7. Under the heading 'Attributes', 'Appendix A' the Appellant  had  sought
    25 points but was not awarded any.  He had stated that he was  entitled
    to 25 points because he had access to no less than �50,000 as  required
    by paragraph 245DD(b) and Appendix A of the Immigration Rules.  He  had
    provided in support of his application two letters from Bank  Al  Habib
    Ltd concerning account holders Muhammad Rafiat Ali and Muhammad  Navaid
    Ali and indicating the amount held in that account  as  at  31  October
    2012.  There was also a third party letter  from  Rifat  Aly  Qazilbesh
    dated 8 November 2012.

 8. In refusing the application the Secretary of State's position was  that
    the Rules required a letter from the  bank  confirming  the  amount  of
    money from the account available to the applicant from any third party.
     The letters from the bank also did not make plain that  the  Appellant
    had been given access by Navaid  Ali  to  funds  held  by  him  in  his
    account.

 9. Another ground for refusal was that the Appellant needed to  show  that
    he was engaged in business activity, other than the work  necessary  to
    administer his business, in an occupation which appears on the list  of
    occupational skills and to National Qualifications Framework  Level  4.
    He had stated a job title of Chief Executive  Officer.   Although  this
    appears on the Standard Occupational List, this job title only  applies
    where the applicant  is  part  of  a  large  major  organisation.   The
    Secretary of State did not consider the wholesale buying and selling of
    garments to be a business activity at the required level and  thus  did
    not meet the requirements specified under Appendix A.

10. A final basis of refusal was in relation to funds held in  a  regulated
    financial institution and funds disposable in the UK.   In  respect  of
    these matters the Appellant had sought 25 points but not  been  awarded
    any.  There was a lack of evidence that the  Appellant  had  access  to
    sufficient funds and the same reasoning was applied in relation to  the
    issue of funds disposable in this country.

11. The Appellants appealed.  Following a hearing at  Taylor  House  before
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  Cockrill  on  24  September  2013  Mr
    Shah's appeal was allowed as was his wife's in line.

12. His findings are at paragraphs [27] to [35] of his  determination.   At
    [29] he found that Bank Al Habib  'is  not  really  in  a  position  to
    confirm the amount of money provided to  the  Appellant  by  any  third
    party.  The situation must surely be  that  it  is  really  up  to  the
    account holders what they do with their funds and the bank is not in  a
    position to do any more really as I see it than say what the  level  of
    funds are held to the credit of a particular account.  In this instance
    it is in a joint account in the names of the paternal uncle and  cousin
    of the first Appellant'.

13. The judge went on (at [30]): 'What the first Appellant has done, and in
    my overall assessment and judgment this must be critical, is to provide
    two Affidavits from the account holders showing not only that they  are
    indeed the account holders, but also that they are confirming that  the
    first Appellant has access to these funds in that joint account.   That
    is information that was properly related as I see to the Respondent.'

14. Further, he stated at [31], having noted that the burden  of  proof  to
    show compliance with the Rules was on the  Appellant:  '...  taking  an
    entirely sensible and practical view, this Appellant has done  what  he
    can to show that he does have access to funds which  are  in  total  in
    excess of �50,000.'

15. And at [33], 'The overall picture ... which is  really  of  fundamental
    importance, is that the first Appellant  has  shown  that  he  has  got
    access to this large sum of money of  over  �50,000  which  is  in  the
    account held by his two relatives.  They have done all they  reasonably
    can to demonstrate that he can have access to those funds and funds can
    be readily remitted to the  United  Kingdom  from  the  Bank  Al  Habib
    Limited.'  Further, 'nothing more can reasonably  be  expected  of  the
    first Appellant.' [33]

16. The judge then went on to find that  he  was  entitled  to  the  points
    claimed in respect of his job title of Chief Executive Officer.

17. The Secretary of State sought permission to appeal which was granted by
    a judge on 24 October 2013.

18. At the error of law hearing before me Mr  Deller,  first,  acknowledged
    that the section 47 decision was not in accordance with the law.

19. Turning to the  judge's  decision  on  the  merits,  he  submitted,  in
    summary, that the Rules set out clearly what requirements needed to  be
    satisfied.  Either the Appellant met the literal interpretation of  the
    requirements of the Rules or not.  The judge had erred  in  applying  a
    different test, namely, that he 'did not quite meet' the  requirements.
    It was simply that the rules are the rules.  There was no unfairness on
    the part of the Respondent.

20. Second, the two affidavits from the relatives  postdated  the  decision
    and were thus not admissible.  The judge, who found them 'critical'  to
    his decision to allow the appeal erred in taking them into account.

21. In reply, Ms. Lovejoy referred to her skeleton argument.   In  summary,
    the judge had correctly noted that the burden of  proof  lay  with  the
    Appellant to show compliance with the Rules.  However, he had found the
    Bank Al Habib, recognised as a valid institution by the Respondent, was
    unable to provide the appropriate letter and  that  the  Appellant  had
    done all he could.  In the circumstances the Rule required a  purposive
    and practical interpretation which allowed for  other  evidence  to  be
    relied on.  To prevent such an interpretation would be contrary to  not
    only the purpose of the Rules but also to the principle of  common  law
    fairness. She noted the headnote in  Ferrer  (limited  appeal  grounds;
    Alvi) [2012] UKUT 00304 (IAC) which stated : 'Applying Philipson  (ILR-
    not PBS: evidence)[2012] UKUT 00039  (IAC),  where  the  provisions  in
    question are ambiguous or obscure, then it is legitimate  to  interpret
    the  provisions  by  assuming  that  Parliament  is  unlikely  to  have
    sanctioned  rules  which  (a)  treat  a  limited   class   of   persons
    unfairly...'

22. Further, the application  form  simply  requests  a  letter  from  each
    financial institution holding  the  applicant's  funds  confirming  the
    amount of money  held  in  that  institution;  confirming  that  it  is
    regulated by the home regulator and that the money is disposable in the
    UK.  Also,  in  relation  to  the  third  party  support  a  letter  of
    permission from each third party providing funds together with a letter
    from a legal advisor confirming the validity of the  permissions.   All
    were duly supplied.  For the additional requirements to be absent  from
    the application form was unfair.

23. Second, if the Respondent was not satisfied with the evidence  received
    further evidence should have been requested from the Appellant prior to
    the Respondent making her decision.

24. Third, there was no error  of  law  in  the  judge's  approach  to  the
    affidavits.  One was submitted with the original application confirming
    the availability of third party funds.  The other two simply  confirmed
    the validity and genuineness of earlier  documents  and  as  such  were
    admissible.

25. In considering this matter  I  note  first  the  applicable  law.   The
    Immigration Rules in force at the date of decision state:


         "Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrants


         245D.  Purpose of this route and meaning of business
         This route is for migrants who wish to establish, join or take over
         one or more businesses in the UK.


         245DD.  Requirements for leave to remain


         (b) The applicant must have a minimum of 75 points under paragraphs
         35 to 53 of Appendix A." (emphasis added)


    Appendix A as then in force provides (as relevant):


         "Attributes for Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrants
         35. An application applying for entry clearance, leave to remain or
         indefinite leave to remain as Tier 1  (Entrepreneur)  Migrant  must
         score 75 points for attributes.


         36. Subject to paragraph 37, available points for applications  for
         entry clearance or leave to remain are shown in Table 4..."


26. Table 4 includes reference to the individual showing he has  access  to
    not less than �50,000.00 and paragraph 41 and 41-SD lay out the way the
    individual can show he had access to funds.  The central issue of  this
    appeal is the access to third party funds.  The relevant  parts  of  41
    and 41-SD as in force at the date of decision provide:

         41. An applicant will only be considered to have  access  to  funds
         if:


         (a) The specified documents in paragraph 41-SD are provided to show
         cash money to the amount required (this must not be in the form  of
         assets);


         (b) The specified documents in paragraph 41-SD are provided to show
         that the applicant has permission to use the money to invest  in  a
         business in the UK; and


         (c)  The  money  is  either  held  in  a  UK  regulated   financial
         institution or is transferable to the UK.


         41-DS.  The specified documents in Table 4 and paragraph 41 are  as
         follows:


          a)  The  specified  documents  to  show  evidence  of  the  money
             available to invest are one or more of the following specified
             documents:


              i) A letter from each financial institution holding the funds,
                 to confirm the amount of money available to  the  applicant
                 (or  the  entrepreneurial  team  if  applying   under   the
                 provisions in paragraph 52 of this Appendix).  Each  letter
                 must:


                    (9)  confirm  the  amount  of  money  provided  to   the
                    applicant from any third party (if applicable)  that  is
                    held in that institution.


                    (10) confirm the name of  each  third  party  and  their
                    contact details, including their full address  including
                    postal  code,  landline  phone  number  and  any   email
                    address, and


                    ...(emphasis added)


27. The crux of the judge's conclusions are at 29 to 31 and 33 (referred to
    above).

28. In my judgement, however, his conclusions were wrong in law.  First,  I
    do not agree with counsel that the  relevant  rules  are  ambiguous  or
    obscure.  They are entirely clear.

29. As the court stated in SSHD v Rodriguez [2014] EWCA  Civ  2  (at  [44])
    'Overall,  the  Immigration   Rules   are   uncompromising   in   their
    stipulations.  They among other things, require the specified documents
    to be lodged with the application.  If the contents  of  the  specified
    documents are not such as to satisfy the requirements as to maintenance
    funding, the points will not be awarded and  the  application  will  be
    refused...'


30. I do not see merit in the criticism that the application  form  (G4,G6)
    does not state the full requirements as set out in the  Rules.   It  is
    the Rules which state the law.  This  is  not  a  situation  where  the
    application form has waived a requirement of the Rules.

31. Nor do I see merit in the submission that if  the  Respondent  was  not
    satisfied with  the  evidence  received,  they  should  have  requested
    further evidence from the Appellant prior to making their decision.  As
    the Court of Appeal stated in Rodriguez (at [92])

    '....it is quite true that the introduction to the process instructions
    flagged up two significant changes, one of which was that "there is  no
    limit on the amount of information  that  can  be  requested  from  the
    appellant".  But it is to be noted that that is  immediately  qualified
    by  the  instruction  that  requests  for  information  should  not  be
    speculative...there must be sufficient  reasons  to  believe  that  any
    evidence requested existed...Taken overall, the Evidential  Flexibility
    process instruction is demonstrably not designed to give  an  appellant
    the opportunity first  to  remedy  any  defect  or  inadequacy  in  the
    application or supporting documentation so as to save  the  application
    from refusal after substantive consideration'.


32. In this case  the  appellant  did  not  meet  the  requirement  of  the
    Immigration Rules in that the specified documentation  required  to  be
    supplied by him was not supplied.  Accordingly, the policy did not fall
    to be applied in his favour.

33. The First-tier judge placed reliance on an  affidavit lodged  with  the
    application from one of the account holders confirming the availability
    of third party funds to the Appellant and, for the hearing, two further
    affidavits from both the account holders purporting to do the same.  He
    found these 'critical' [30] in showing that the Appellant had access to
    the funds in the joint account.

34. I consider that the judge  erred  in  so  finding.   As  indicated  the
    Appellant was required to ensure  that  the  specified  documents  were
    lodged with the application.  They were not.  A letter  from  the  bank
    (31 October 2012) (C2) states only that Muhammad Rifat Aly and Muhammad
    Navaid Ali maintain accounts with the bank.  Another,  undated,  letter
    (C1) states that the account holders use the account and  can  transfer
    amounts abroad. These did not advance the case as they do  not  confirm
    the amount of money available to the Appellants  or  provided  to  them
    from any third party. A third party letter (8 November  2012)  from  M.
    Rifat Ali only (which is not in the bundle and which neither side could
    give me sight of, but  which  it  was  accepted  was  produced  to  the
    Secretary of State) was also not a specified document  as  set  out  in
    paragraph 41-SD. Two affidavits by M.  Rifat  Ali  and  M.  Navaid  Ali
    lodged for the hearing also did not advance the case.   They  were  not
    admissible under section 85A (3) of the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002.  I  do  not  accept  the  submission  that  the  later
    affidavits were covered by section 85A (4)  (c)  as  being  adduced  to
    prove that the items submitted with the application  were  'genuine  or
    valid'. There was no suggestion that the  earlier  documents  were  not
    genuine or valid. Rather, that they were not  items  permitted  by  the
    Rules.

35. For the reasons stated the First-tier judge materially  erred  in  law.
    His decision allowing the appeal under  the  Rules  is  set  aside  and
    remade as follows:  the appeals are  dismissed  under  the  Immigration
    Rules.

36. The Appellants had raised human rights in the original grounds.  I  was
    referred to brief statements by the Appellants (12 September  2013).  I
    also heard brief evidence from Mr Shah, which was unchallenged. It  was
    not  argued  that  they  had  any  claim  to  stay  on  the  basis   of
    family/private life under the Rules. The submissions were  in  relation
    to ECHR.

37. It is clear that the Appellants have family life  together  here.  Were
    they to be removed there would be no interference with that family life
    as they would be removed together.

38. As for private life, the evidence, which I accept, was that he has been
    in the UK for some six years, she for a shorter time, always  lawfully.
    His wife used to work for Marks and Spencer as a  section  coordinator.
    She is now pregnant and no  longer  working.  They  live  in  a  rented
    property. They are used to living  here  and  get  support.  They  have
    contributed to society and paid their  taxes.  Treatment  for  pregnant
    women is better here than in Pakistan.

39. It may be that the Appellants during their  time  here  have  built  up
    contacts and associations such as to amount to a private life.  If  so,
    and  if  interference  reached  the  threshold  for   establishing   an
    interference with that private life,  such  interference  would  be  in
    accordance with the law and  pursues  a  legitimate  aim,  namely,  the
    maintenance of a fair and effective system of immigration control.

40. In Nasim and others (Article 8 [2014] UKUT 25 (IAC) it  was  held  that
    the judgements of the Supreme Court in Patel and others v  SSHD  [2013]
    UKSC 25 (IAC) serve to re-focus attention on the nature and purpose  of
    Article 8 of the ECHR and, in particular, to recognise  that  article's
    limited utility in private life cases that are  far  removed  from  the
    protection of an individual's moral and physical integrity.

41. In this case the Appellant came to the UK in 2006 (his  wife  in  2011)
    spending until 2010 as a student and since then as a Tier 1 (Post Study
    ) Migrant. They wish to remain as Tier 1 Entrepreneurs.  Although  they
    have been here some years the vast majority of their  lives  have  been
    spent in their  home  country.  They  have  very  limited  evidence  of
    attachments and associations here. They own no property.  They  are  in
    good health. The fact that they have not relied  on  public  funds  and
    have been lawful throughout does not enhance their human  rights.  They
    fail to meet the Rules. In Patel it was held that  there  is  no  'near
    miss' argument as such albeit that all facts  have  to  be  taken  into
    account and considered in context. I consider on the facts of this case
    that it is at the 'fuzzy penumbra' of Article 8 (Nasim [20]), and  that
    the issue of proportionality is resolved in favour of the Secretary  of
    State, by reference to her functions as the guardian of the  system  of
    immigration controls, entrusted to her by Parliament.

42. The appeals fail on human rights grounds.

    DECISION

         The decision of the previous Tribunal involved the making of an
         error of law. Its decision is set aside and remade as follows:

         The appeals are dismissed under the Immigration Rules.

         The appeals are dismissed on human rights grounds (Article 8)

         The appeal in so far as it relates to the decision to remove the
         Appellants is allowed as not being in accordance with the law.
