For the Respondent:    Mr C Bates, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan, born on 14th  March  1986,  and
    he appealed to the First-tier Tribunal  against  the  decision  of  the
    Secretary of State, taken on 13th December 2014, to refuse to grant him
    a residence card  as  a  spouse  under  Regulations  2  and  6  of  the
    Immigration   (European   Economic   Area)   Regulations   2006   ("the
    Regulations").

2.   Having arrived in the United Kingdom on 18th August 2013, as a  student
    with leave until 19th January 2014, the appellant applied to the  First
    Tier Tribunal on 19th January 2014, for leave  as  a  Tier  4  Migrant.
    This was subsequently refused on  16th  August  2014.   Meanwhile,  the
    appellant met his wife and on 16th April 2014, he underwent an  Islamic
    wedding with her.  On 21st July 2014, they both  underwent  a  registry
    office wedding.  The appellant applied for  a  residence  card  on  7th
    August 2014.

3.   The appeal was first heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge Lambert.

4.   At a hearing before me in Manchester on 20th October 2016, I  concluded
    that there were material errors of law in the  determination  of  Judge
    Lambert, because she had failed  to  make  findings  of  fact  on  oral
    evidence she heard from two witnesses in support of the  appellant  who
    gave oral evidence to her.  A copy of my reasons for finding  an  error
    of law is set out below at Appendix A.

5.   I believe that at that  hearing  I  handed  to  Counsel  a  variety  of
    documents upon which the appellant relied.  I asked that they be placed
    in one properly indexed and paginated bundle and then  be  re-submitted
    to the Tribunal.

6.   I am advised that the documents  have  not  been  re-submitted  to  the
    Tribunal.

7.   The matter next came for hearing before me on 20th April 2017 when  the
    Secretary of State was represented by Mr  G  Harrison,  a  Senior  Home
    Office Presenting Officer and the appellant was represented by Mr Sabir
    of Counsel instructed by MBS Solicitors.  Mr Harrison explained that he
    had a transcript of an interview record conducted with  the  appellant,
    but he needed to refer it to the Immigration Officer for him to confirm
    it was a true and accurate record.  Mr Harrison told  me  that  he  had
    agreed with Counsel that if this appeal were to be adjourned for  eight
    weeks it might well shorten the hearing.  He and Mr Sabir asked that  I
    list the matter for mention only on the first available date after 20th
    June 2017.  I excused the appellant's attendance.

8.   The matter was listed for hearing on 22nd June,  when  Mr  M  Sabir  of
    Counsel again appeared on behalf  of  the  appellant  and  Mr  Harrison
    appeared on behalf of the respondent.  The hearing  was  before  Deputy
    Upper Tribunal Judge D M W Pickup.   Mr  Sabir  had  gone  through  the
    record  of  the  interview  notebook,  but  some  parts  of  it  needed
    clarification and he and Mr Harrison agreed that the matter  should  be
    adjourned for a further eight week  period  after  which  it  could  be
    listed for hearing.

9.   Despite my having noted on the file that the matter could  be  referred
    to any Upper-tier Judge or Deputy Judge,  Judge  Pickup  adjourned  the
    matter for hearing before me.

10.  The matter was next listed before  me  on  15th  September  2017,  when
    there was no appearance by the appellant.  Mr Harrison  again  attended
    on  behalf  of  the  respondent.   I  noted  from  the  file  that  the
    appellant's former solicitors had notified a change of address  to  the
    Tribunal.  Unfortunately, the Tribunal  had  not  marked  the  note  of
    address on the file and had sent the Notice of  Hearing  to  the  wrong
    address.  I adjourned the hearing and marked the file to indicate  that
    it was not reserved to me. It was re-listed for rehearing again on 23rd
    November 2017.  The matter was heard by Upper Tribunal  Judge  Plimmer.
    She noted that there was no attendance by the appellant.   Mr  Harrison
    told Judge Plimmer that he had two telephone numbers for the  appellant
    and his wife.  After a brief adjournment Mr Harrison told Judge Plimmer
    that he had tried ringing both numbers but without success.

11.  Rather than proceed with the hearing in the absence of  the  appellant,
    Judge Plimmer adjourned the matter and instructed  that  it  should  be
    listed before me.  The earliest date the matter could be listed  before
    me was today, 9th February.

12.  I apologise to the parties for  the  delays  in  hearing  this  matter.
    Such delays are inevitable when  matters  are  reserved  to  part  time
    judges.

13.  At 11.15 the usher  told  me  that  there  was  no  appearance  by  the
    appellant.

14.  I noted from the file that notice  giving  the  date,  time  and  place
    fixed for the hearing of the appeal had been sent  to  the  appellant's
    last known address on 10th January and no explanation offered  for  the
    appellant's non-attendance.

15.  Given that the appellant had  failed  to  attend  the  matter  on  23rd
    November and had failed to comply with Judge Plimmer's directions  that
    he should file and serve a  written  explanation  for  his  failure  to
    attend the Tribunal on 23rd November 2017 before 1st November 2017, and
    believing there to be no reason why I could not justly dispose  of  the
    hearing of the appeal in the absence of the  appellant,  I  decided  to
    proceed with the hearing in his absence.

16.   In  September  2013,  the  appellant  made   contact   with   a   Miss
    Kondratavicitu ("the  sponsor"),  a  Lithuanian  national  residing  in
    Lithuania, via Facebook.  She came to the United Kingdom with her child
    on 3rd January 2014, and  the  appellant  apparently  met  her  at  the
    airport following which she and her child went to live with him at  his
    home.  It appears that on 6th April 2014,  they  underwent  an  Islamic
    wedding ceremony and  later,  on  21st  July  2014,  they  underwent  a
    registry office  marriage.   It  was  on  7th  August  2014,  that  the
    appellant made an application which resulted in this appeal.

17.  On 4th December 2014, Immigration  Officers  attended  the  appellant's
    home and concluded that he and  the  sponsor  were  not  in  a  genuine
    relationship.  His application for a residence card was refused on  the
    basis that the  marriage  between  him  and  the  sponsor  was  one  of
    convenience.  I  have  a  photocopy  of  a  record  of  an  Immigration
    Officer's notebook and I have a typed transcript of  that  notebook,  a
    copy of which had been earlier handed to the appellant's Counsel at  an
    earlier hearing before me.  When questioned about how long she had been
    married, the sponsor replied, "English marriage five months.  I  forgot
    the date".  It appears that she then produced a copy  of  her  marriage
    certificate showing that she  was  married  on  21st  July  2014.   She
    explained that she underwent a Muslim marriage on 6th April 2014.   She
    explained that she met her husband on Facebook and he  invited  her  to
    come to England after they had been in  communication  for  some  three
    months.  She explained that she was working behind a bar and  that  her
    husband was currently working in the same restaurant,  Lal  Qila.   She
    said that she slept with her husband at the property and that  she  and
    her husband communicate in English.

18.  A Home Office report referred to the interview  with  the  sponsor  and
    expresses the view that the marriage did not seem to be  genuine.   The
    ground floor bedroom appeared,

         "to be staged with two white shirts and some socks that  belong  to
         Mr Wahab.  The majority of Mr Wahab's clothing are in the  upstairs
         back bedroom.  [The sponsor] said that Mr Wahab and Mr  Atif  Munir
         eat and talk in the  upstairs  back  bedroom.   This  seems  highly
         unlikely as there is no table in the upstairs back bedroom and  the
         house has a living room and dining room on the ground  floor  where
         it would be easier to eat and talk".


    The Immigration Officer thought it would have been more appropriate for
    the family to reside upstairs in the back bedroom,  as  it  was  larger
    than the bedroom on the ground floor.  The  Chief  Immigration  Officer
    who searched the house on entry noticed that all bedrooms on the  first
    floor appeared to be lived in.

19.  The sponsor claimed that she  had  two  or  three  photographs  of  the
    couple on Facebook, but was only able to show one photograph of her and
    Mr Wahab where they were standing side by side.  There were no  wedding
    photographs on Facebook and when this was queried with the sponsor  she
    said that she had sent the photographs to her family directly.  She was
    asked if she had any other photographs and explained  that  her  tablet
    was only a couple of weeks old.  The interviewing officer noticed  that
    on being showed the photographs on the tablet there appeared to be many
    of the sponsor's child as a baby  and  photographs  of  her  family  in
    Lithuania.  There were no photos on the tablet of  the  couple  or  the
    couple's marriage.  The appellant  was  not  present  at  the  premises
    during the inspection.

20.  I have read the appellant's lengthy grounds of appeal and I  have  also
    read the appellant's  application  to  the  Secretary  of  State,  with
    accompanying documents including evidence from Archway Ventures Limited
    trading as Lal Qila confirming that as at 1st August 2014, the  sponsor
    was employed as a bar assistant and had been since 1st  February  2014,
    working 40 hours per week earning �1,093.78 per month.  I  also  saw  a
    letter from Manchester City Council addressed to both the appellant and
    sponsor at the same address dealing with arrears of council tax.  There
    was no other evidence before me.

21.  I am satisfied that the evidence adduced by  the  respondent  justifies
    reasonable suspicion  that  the  marriage  between  the  appellant  and
    sponsor was entered  into  for  the  predominant  purpose  of  securing
    residence rights.   The  evidential  burden  therefore  passes  to  the
    appellant to address that contention (Papajorgji (EEA spouse - marriage
    of convenience) Greece [2012] UKUT 00038, Agho [2016] EWCA Civ 1198 and
    Sadovska and Others v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2017]
    UKSC 54.

22.  The appellant has adduced no credible evidence at all.

23.  The appellant has been given every opportunity to present his case  but
    has chosen not to avail himself of those opportunities.  I believe that
    the marriage between  the  appellant  and  sponsor  is  a  marriage  of
    convenience and as such  is  excluded  by  Regulation  2  of  the  2006
    Regulations.

24.  The appellant's appeal in respect of a decision to refuse to issue  him
    an EEA residence card is dismissed.

No anonymity direction is made.
