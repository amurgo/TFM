                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

   1. The appellant is a national of Pakistan born on 3 October 1984. She
      applied for entry clearance for settlement as the wife of her sponsor,
      Mr Mohammed Iftar. He is originally from Pakistan. He came here as a
      student and has been granted indefinite leave to remain.


   2. The application was refused by the respondent on 2 December 2016.It
      was not accepted that the marriage was genuine and subsisting, with
      the parties intending to live together permanently. Furthermore, the
      financial requirements were not met. The sponsor was required to
      demonstrate earnings by the specified proofs of �18,600. He stated
      that from October 2016 he was earning �18,720 employed by a business
      trading as Executive Services. A member of the respondent's staff
      contacted his employer on 23 November 2016 and the same day spoke to
      the sponsor. Discrepancies in the 2 accounts were identified. There
      was also no evidence of the business being registered with Companies
      house.

   3. On reconsideration the entry clearance manager accepted that the
      relationship was genuine. This then left the financial issue.

   4. Her appeal was heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge Devittie at Taylor
      House on 22 February 2018. In a decision promulgated on 26 March 2018
      it was dismissed. The judge recorded that the appellant had meantime
      made another application which was refused on 20 November 2017.

   5. At the time of hearing the sponsor stated he had changed jobs and was
      now earning �19,550 the year. The judge said that the documentary
      evidence about this income was unsatisfactory. Reference was made to
      the original discrepancies when the respondent contacted his then
      employer. The purpose behind the call was to test the genuineness of
      the employment. The judge said that this in turn called into question
      the genuineness of the new employment. The sponsor's employer had not
      attended. At hearing the sponsor produced further evidence about his
      new employment but the judge commented that the documents were not
      stamped and had not been seen by the respondent.

   6. Permission to appeal was granted on the basis that in assessing the
      appellant's article 8 rights the judge should have considered this new
      employment of the sponsor when considering the proportionality of the
      decision.

Consideration

   7. Schedule 9 of the 2014 Act amended section 85(4) of the Nationality,
      Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. This provides that in an appeal under
      section 82(1) `the tribunal may consider... any matter which[it]
      thinks relevant to the substance of the decision, including... any
      matter arising after the date of decision.' In terms of the
      immigration rules the issue was whether the appellant met the rules at
      the time of the decision. New evidence can be introduced which shows
      that at that time the rules were met. In the present instance the
      subsequent evidence is not further evidence going to establish this.
      It relates to a different timescale and the crew set out in appendix
      FM SE have to be complied with. The subsequent evidence produced
      relates to employment post decision. As such this cannot be relevant
      to whether the rules were met at the time of decision but may be
      relevant towards the overall proportionality of the decision.


   8. First-tier judge Judge Devittie did not refuse to consider the
      evidence in relation to new employment. The judge was critical of the
      apparent production of this evidence at a late stage. It was not
      referred to in the grounds of appeal. The bundle produced was not date
      stamped. The judge at paragraph 7 refers to salary slips in respect of
      the period 8 July 2017 to 25 November 2017 and salary slips January
      2018 as well as tax returns for 2016 and 2017.

   9. The judge at paragraph 9 noted that the sponsor's employer did not
      attend nor was there any statement in relation to the allegations made
      in the refusal letter. Mr Raza sought to amend the grounds of appeal
      on the basis that there was a mistake of fact on the part of the judge
      in that the appeal bundles in fact did contain a statement from the
      original employer. Ms J Isherwood did not oppose the change to the
      grounds but submitted that the letter was brief and did not adequately
      address the issues arising.

  10. The presenting officer's point was that the additional evidence
      submitted at hearing did not address the concerns of the entry
      clearance officer. Rather, it was an attempt to make a fresh claim
      based on different evidence and was making the judge the primary
      decision maker.

  11. It is not clear from the decision if both the parties were represented
      although in the narrative the judge refers to counsel handing in
      documents on behalf of the appellant.

  12. At paragraph 8 the judge makes the point that Ms Isherwood has made.
      The refusal is dated 2 December 2016 and the respondent raises
      discrepancies about the original claimed employment including the
      interview by telephone. The refusal sets out conflict between the
      evidence of the sponsor and that of his employer intended to test the
      genuineness of the employment. There was concern that the employment
      claimed in the application was not genuine. The accounts apparently
      differed about the appellant's probationary period and his duties. The
      judge did not find the subsequent evidence assisted. The judge
      concluded by saying that the refusal was not disproportionate albeit
      it was accepted the relationship with genuine and subsisting. The
      possibility of a fresh application was alluded to.

  13. I do find merit in the points made by Ms Isherwood and there is a
      danger of being distracted by a suggestion that the judge did not
      consider the new evidence produced which was not the case.

  14. I was advised by that Mr Z Raza that the subsequent unsuccessful
      application has been appeal and is due to be heard in December 2018.
      The appeal is restricted to consideration of the appellant's article 8
      rights. It is correct that the judge did not refer to the letter from
      the original employer. There is also mention in the grounds of appeal
      that his employer at that stage was not in fact the limited company
      and therefore the reference to searches companies office would have
      been unproductive in any event. The judge does not refer to this.

  15. My conclusion is that a material error of fact in the decision has
      been demonstrated in that the judge indicates there was no supportive
      evidence in relation to the original employment whereas in fact there
      was. The letter from the employer would have to be evaluated. This may
      not make any difference to the ultimate outcome but is something which
      will have to be determined.

  16. Given the acceptance of a genuine relationship and the change of
      employment the interests of justice best served by setting this
      decision aside with a view to remitting the appeal for rehearing. If
      possible, it should be heard at the same time as the appeal in
      relation to the subsequent refusal. In this way the judge hearing the
      case have a complete picture in considering the proportionality of the
      decision.

Decision

A material error of law has been demonstrated in the decision of First-tier
Tribunal Judge Devittie. Consequently, that decision can no longer stand.
The appeal is remitted for a de novo hearing in the First-tier Tribunal

Directions.

   1. Relist for a de novo hearing excluding First-tier Tribunal Judge
      Devittie. Every effort should be made to have the appeal hearing
      listed at the same time as the appeal of the subsequent decision. The
      respondent should advise the tribunal of the relevant reference number
      and any information about the listing arrangements. If this cannot be
      done then it is preferable this appeal is not heard until after the
      appeal in relation to the subsequent application is dealt with. In
      this situation the judge hearing the present appeal should be provided
      with a copy of the original decision in the subsequent application and
      a copy of any appeal decision.

   2. The appellant's representative is to provide a fresh bundle containing
      all the documentary evidence relied upon in relation to employment.

   3. If at all possible a presenting officer should attend at the hearing.

   4. There would appear to be no need for an interpreter. If there is in
      the appellant's representative should advise the tribunal.

   5. A hearing time of no more than 1 � hours is anticipated
