                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against a determination of First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    A M Black, promulgated on 18th May 2017, following a hearing at  Taylor
    House on 10th May 2017.  In the determination, the judge dismissed  the
    appeal of the Appellant, whereupon the Appellant  subsequently  applied
    for, and was granted, permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal,  and
    thus the matter comes before me.



The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a female, a citizen of Bangladesh, and was born on 1st
    September 1991.  She appealed against the decision  of  the  Respondent
    Entry Clearance Officer dated 13th November 2015,  refusing  her  entry
    clearance as a partner under Appendix FM of the  Immigration  Rules  of
    her husband, Mr Mohammed Abdul Karim, who is a British citizen.

The Appellant's Claim

 3. The basis of the Appellant's claim is that she  and  the  Sponsor  were
    married in Bangladesh and their marriage was registered in that country
    on 21st March 2014.  They lived together as man and wife in the  family
    home in Bangladesh until the Sponsor returned to the  UK  a  few  weeks
    later.  They had not lived together since.  The Sponsor was  unable  to
    travel back to Bangladesh due to his job and  other  commitments.   The
    date of the application to enter was in 2015.  The last time that  they
    cohabited  together  was  in  March  2014  when  the  Sponsor  was   in
    Bangladesh.  The couple do, however, keep in contact by telephone,  and
    WhatsApp etc.  The Sponsor also sends funds to the  Appellant  for  her
    maintenance.  The judge, in considering  these  facts,  observed  that,
    "the couple's family life is very limited indeed.  They married in  the
    knowledge that they could only live in the UK together if the Appellant
    met  the  criteria  for  entry  clearance  as  the  Sponsor's   spouse"
    (paragraph 15).

The Basis of the Refusal

 4. The reason why the application of the Appellant was refused to join her
    sponsoring husband in the UK was that she  had  submitted  an  unsigned
    cheque to demonstrate her Sponsor's employment in one particular  month
    in a sequence of months.  There was only one unsigned cheque.  However,
    the Respondent ECO incorrectly stated that there was more than one such
    cheque.  As the  judge  observed,  "it  is  not  in  dispute  that  the
    Appellant had submitted such a document" (paragraph 23).  The  unsigned
    cheque  was  then  rejected  by  the  bank,  but  a  deposit  had  been
    subsequently been made by the Sponsor's  employer  by  way  of  a  bank
    transfer for the equivalent sum, such that  the  "funds  cited  in  the
    cheque had been credited to the Sponsor's account" (paragraph 23).

The Judge's Findings

 5. On the basis of the above facts, the judge observed that there was  "an
    anomaly which was not addressed by the applicant in  her  application",
    namely, the crediting of the unsigned cheque by the employer paying the
    equivalent amount into the Sponsor's account.   The  Appellant  herself
    submitted that she had complied with  the  evidential  requirements  of
    paragraph 2(c) of Appendix  FM-SE,  which  required  the  Appellant  to
    provide "personal bank statements corresponding to the  same  period(s)
    as the payslips at paragraph 2(a), showing that  the  salary  has  been
    paid into her account ...".

 6. The judge went on to determine this "anomaly" on the basis that, "while
    that was the case, it was not unusual for the Respondent to address the
    anomaly presented by the unsigned cheque and bank  statement.   In  the
    absence of any  explanation  from  the  Appellant,  or  an  explanatory
    further bank statement, the Respondent was entitled to conclude that an
    unsigned cheque was not sufficient to cause funds to be credited  to  a
    bank statement; it was reasonable for the Respondent to  conclude  that
    the Sponsor  had  not  given  a  genuine  account  of  his  employment"
    (paragraph 23).

 7. The appeal was dismissed.

Grounds of Application

 8. The grounds of application state that given that the judge had accepted
    (at paragraph 23) that, "the Respondent was incorrect in  stating  that
    more than one unsigned cheque was provided", it was wrong for the judge
    then to dismiss the appeal on the basis that  there  was  an  "anomaly"
    that was not addressed by the Appellant in her  application.   This  is
    because the bank statement in the Respondent's bundle clearly indicated
    that cheques deposited on 7th  October  2015,  unpaid  cheque  on  12th
    October 2015, and the employer Olive Indian Cuisine,  made  a  payment,
    then remaking a correction on 14th October 2015, and that this sufficed
    to address the anomaly.

 9. Furthermore, the bank statement itself clarified the position and  this
    was clear from pages 19, 20, and 22 of the Respondent's bundle.  It was
    certainly not clear from this, how the  judge  would  have  stated  (at
    paragraph 24) that, "it called into question  the  genuineness  of  the
    employment".

10. In any event, the judge erred in stating (at paragraph 24) that,  "this
    is not an appeal under the Immigration Rules" given that  this  was  an
    entry clearance application  under  the  Family  Migration  Rules  with
    reference to  Appendix  FM-SE  of  the  Immigration  Rules,  and  money
    accredited into the Sponsor's bank account on  7th  October  2015  (see
    page 22 of the Respondent's bundle) should have enabled  the  Secretary
    of State to exercise discretion, in the  absence  of  which  the  judge
    ought to have allowed the appeal.

11. On 14th August 2017 the Tribunal allowed the  application  and  granted
    permission  to  appeal.   This  was  particularly  so  given  that  the
    Appellant had submitted six months payslips and letters  of  employment
    from both employment and bank statements  as  required.   The  unsigned
    cheque had been issued inadvertently by the employer  and  the  Sponsor
    deposited this and it was credited.  Subsequently the unpaid cheque was
    debited and the employer transferred money credited  to  the  Sponsor's
    bank  account.   This  correction  was  made  prior  to  the  date   of
    application.  Accordingly, a different construction  should  have  been
    placed upon the bank documentation.

12. A Rule 24 response  was  entered  by  the  Respondent  Entry  Clearance
    Officer on 13th September 2017  to  the  fact  that  the  Tribunal  had
    directed itself appropriately and the assessment of the evidence was  a
    matter for the judge.

Submissions

13. At the hearing before me on 19th October 2017 Mr Mustapha, appearing on
    behalf of the Appellant made two submissions.

14. First, that as a matter of proportionality the judge had erred  in  law
    (at paragraphs 27 to 28) by stating that the Appellant did not  satisfy
    the financial requirements of Appendix FM.  At the time of the decision
    the Appellant could point to funds of �19,344, as well as at  the  time
    of the hearing before the judge.

15. Second, all the specified evidence, under paragraph 2 of Appendix FM-SE
    was submitted and at paragraph  23  of  the  determination,  the  judge
    accepts  this.   The  finding  of  the  judge  was  therefore   clearly
    unsustainable.  This was so because the judge then went on  wrongly  to
    question  the  "genuineness"  of  the  apparent  relationship  of   the
    sponsoring husband.  However, the HMRC employment history (see pages 14
    of the Appellant's  bundle)  clearly  confirmed  the  start  date,  the
    salary, and the name of the employer (see page 4  of  14).   Thereafter
    the HMRC annual tax summary (see page  5  of  14)  confirmed  that  the
    Sponsor's annual taxable income was �19,344.  I

16. n any event, when the Respondent stated that there  was  a  discrepancy
    between the payslip and the bank statement, this was a mistake of  fact
    by the Secretary of State because one only has to look at  the  payslip
    (which Mr Mustapha handed up) to see that the payslip is at pages 14 to
    16 of the Appellant's bundle for the Olive Indian Cuisine Ltd  and  for
    the Bhatti Indian Cuisine.

17. Finally, it is clear from documentation relating to  the  Olive  Indian
    Cuisine (at pages 11 to 13), as  well  as  the  documentation  for  the
    Bhatti Indian Cuisine (at pages 19 to 21) that  the  Appellant  was  in
    genuine employment.  The Appellant had submitted  bank  statements  (at
    pages 26 to 32 of the bundle) to help her clarify the  situation.   The
    judge had placed undue emphasis on one unsigned cheque at a time of the
    decision.

18. However, there was a perfectly innocent explanation for this.  This was
    there on 6th October 2015, the employer had inadvertently submitted  an
    unsigned cheque and the Sponsor had paid this into his bank, which  had
    credited it to his account on 7th October 2015  (see  page  32  of  his
    bundle), only then on 12th October to see that  cheque  being  returned
    (see page 33), but that before the date  of  the  application  on  27th
    October 2015, the employer on 14th October 2015 had already transferred
    the correct amount into the Sponsor's bank account.

19. The point, submitted Mr Mustapha in his eloquent submissions before me,
    was that the specified evidence was before the  ECO  and  he  was  duty
    bound to take into account the HMRC employment history, which had  also
    been submitted, such that no confusion as to  the  genuineness  of  the
    employment ought to have arisen.

20. For his part, Mr Avery submitted that the issue  before  this  Tribunal
    was a narrow one.  One of the cheques had not been signed.  It  created
    a suspicion.  The suspicion was referred to  quite  reasonably  by  the
    judge (at paragraph 23 of the determination), when it was held that  it
    was not unreasonable for the ECO to conclude as he did.   There  was  a
    flaw.  There was an explanation given for the flaw.  It was open now to
    the Appellant to make a fresh application.

21. In reply, Mr Mustapha submitted that the anomaly arose as a  result  of
    an unsigned cheque.  However, Appendix FM does not prescribe  the  mode
    of payment.  Since the matter was then addressed  specifically  in  the
    Notice of Appeal, and addressed also at the hearing before  the  judge,
    it was up to the judge thereafter to  assess  the  genuineness  of  the
    employment, on the evidence before the Tribunal, take into account  the
    HMRC documents, and the relevant employment history, before  concluding
    whether the employment of the Sponsor  was  "genuine"  or  not.   There
    could only have been one answer, namely, that the employment was indeed
    genuine and that there had simply been an anomaly of a single  unsigned
    cheque which had subsequently been addressed prior to  the  application
    by the employer himself.

Error of Law

22. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  involved
    the making of an error on a point of law (see  Section  12(1)  of  TCEA
    2007) such that I should set aside the decision.   My  reasons  are  as
    follows.

23. This is a case where, as Mr Avery has submitted, the issue  before  the
    Tribunal was a narrow one.  That  narrow  issue  related  to  a  single
    unsigned cheque.  In relation to this, the  judge  had  earlier  stated
    that, the Respondent was  incorrect  in  stating  that  more  than  one
    unsigned cheque was provided" (paragraph 23).   Thereafter  funds  were
    credited to the Sponsor's account.   It  is  not  the  case  that  this
    "anomaly" was not addressed by the Appellant in their application.

24. But more importantly, the issue was simply one of  the  genuineness  of
    the employment, and there was  ample  evidence  in  the  form  of  HMRC
    documents, payslips, and bank statements, to  confirm  that  it  was  a
    genuine employment.  All that Appendix FM requires at paragraph 2(c) is
    that, "personal bank statements corresponding to the same period(s)  as
    the payslips at paragraph 2(a), showing that the salary has  been  paid
    into an account in the name of the person or in the name of the  person
    and their partner jointly" is complied with.

25. In this case, there was no  reason  to  think  that  it  had  not  been
    complied with.  The Sponsor's employer Olive  Indian  Cuisine,  made  a
    correction on 14th October 2015, with respect to the unsigned cheque of
    7th October 2015.  It is the bank statement which  is  referred  to  at
    paragraph 2(c)  of  Appendix  FM-SE  and  it  was  the  Sponsor's  bank
    statement which clarified the position whilst  the  correction  by  the
    employer had been made on 15th October 2015.  The mistake of leaving  a
    cheque unsigned is not unknown.

26. The relevant issue  was  not  that  of  the  cheque  but  of  the  bank
    statement.  By the time of the decision of the Entry Clearance  Officer
    the matter had been clarified by the  employer  subsequently  crediting
    the Sponsor's bank account.  When considered in the  context  of  other
    official documents, such as the HMRC bank statements, and the payslips,
    it is plain that there was ample evidence to confirm that the  employer
    was genuinely employed on a salary of �19,344.

Re-Making the Decision

27. I have remade the decision on the basis of the findings of the original
    judge, the evidence before him, and the submissions that I  have  heard
    today.  I am allowing this appeal for the reasons that  have  been  set
    out above.  I have found Mr Mustapha's submissions  to  be  compelling,
    and for the reasons set out in the Grounds of Appeal and the  grant  of
    permission, I am allowing this appeal.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an  error  of
law such that it falls to be set aside.  I set aside  the  decision  of  the
original judge.  I remake the decision as follows. This appeal is allowed.

No anonymity direction is made.
