For the Appellant:     Mr N Blake QC and Ms S  Naik,  instructed  by  South
                   West Law
For the Respondent:    Mr J Gulvin, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

  1. This an appeal from the determination of an Adjudicator, Mr B  Watkins
     CMG, dated 8 January 2003.  The Appellant,  a  Haitian,  had  appealed
     against the refusal of the Secretary of State to revoke a  deportation
     order and to grant asylum.  The  Adjudicator  dismissed  the  appeals.
     The appeal gives rise to issues of some complexity.

Facts

  2. The Appellant arrived in the United Kingdom, as  a  visitor,  in  1989
     aged twenty-three.  His claim for asylum  was  refused  in  1990.   In
     1992/3, the Secretary of State made a deportation  order  against  the
     Appellant, and refused to revoke it in November 1993.  This order  was
     made following  the  recommendation  of  the  Crown  Court  which  had
     convicted him of two offences of  assault  occasioning  actual  bodily
     harm, one of theft and one of burglary.  He was sentenced to  a  total
     of two years and nine months imprisonment, the  longest  term  of  the
     four consecutive sentences  being  one  year  for  the  burglary.   He
     obtained early release  in  August  1994.   This  was  not  his  first
     experience of prison in this country.  A  year  before,  he  had  been
     convicted of three offences of burglary and one of attempted theft for
     which he had received sentences of imprisonment.  These appear to have
     been concurrent, and the longest sentence was eighteen months.

  3. On 6 February 1995, the Tribunal allowed an appeal from  the  decision
     of an Adjudicator against, it appears, both the refusal  of  leave  to
     remain and the refusal to revoke the deportation order.  It did so  on
     asylum grounds.  Mr Watkins summarised the basis of  its  decision  as
     follows:

           "13.  By a majority (the Chairman and Mrs Lloyd JP), the IAT was
                 of the view that returning the  appellant  to  Haiti  would
                 breach the UK's  obligations  under  the  1951  Convention.
                 They did so having received evidence from the Deputy  UNHCR
                 Representative in London.  They did so  also  because  they
                 believed that the appellant would be seen as  pro-President
                 Aristide, in part because of  the  appellant's  connections
                 with the USA and in part because of his association with St
                 Joseph's Boys'  Home  with  which  President  Aristide  was
                 associated.  They did not accept that his alleged fear as a
                 former Ton Ton Macoute amounted to a well-founded fear  for
                 a 1951 Convention  reason.   That  was  considered  in  the
                 context of the violent and corrupt state of Haiti."

  4. The Tribunal accepted the evidence of the Appellant in its essentials.
      (It had decided to hear all the evidence  afresh  because  of  errors
     which it thought the Adjudicator had made).  The  Appellant  had  been
     orphaned aged eight and had lived on the streets for a year and a half
     before being taken into  an  orphanage  from  where  an  American,  Mr
     Geilenfeld, had taken him to a boys' home where he was cared for until
     he was eighteen.  Then he remained working at the home;  he  had  come
     to regard Mr Geilenfeld as a stepfather.  Threats by street  boys  had
     led Mr Geilenfeld to obtain from the police for the  Appellant  an  ID
     card which showed that he was an attach�;  he then bought and  carried
     a gun.  As an attach� he had the power to make  arrests.   The  police
     attach�s,  unlike  the  army  attach�s,  did  not  cause  problems  to
     civilians, though there  was  some  extortion  in  which  he  did  not
     participate.  The Ton Ton Macoute had far greater power and used it to
     extort money on a wide scale reinforcing their threats with  violence;
     they were a corrupt  and  violent  political  force  working  for  the
     government.

  5. In 1986, as a result of what he told  journalists  about  the  way  in
     which the regime treated children,  there  was  a  plot  to  kill  the
     Appellant which led to the removal of his attach� ID card as a  safety
     measure.  He was later asked by Mr Geilenfeld to help to deal  with  a
     breach of security at the US Embassy which involved  Haitian  security
     guards selling visa forms.  He identified the three  guards  involved,
     who in order to obtain those jobs in the first place would have had to
     be attach�s or Ton Ton Macoute.  In  1987  there  were  two  attempted
     attacks on him at the boys' home by people who thought that he  was  a
     Ton Ton Macoute.  Mr Geilenfeld helped him to  leave  temporarily  for
     the USA but he returned because things were getting  better,  although
     he had to keep a low profile.  He was arrested on two occasions by the
     police, beaten and ill-treated but eventually released without  charge
     through the interventions of Mr Geilenfeld.  After he had made another
     trip to the USA from which he returned to  Haiti,  he  met  a  British
     woman doing charity work in Haiti, became engaged to her  and  at  her
     suggestion came here and applied for asylum.   There  were  supporting
     letters from Mr Geilenfeld explaining what the risk to  the  Appellant
     was:  people were still looking to take revenge on him.  His life  and
     work in the orphanage, his visits to and association with the USA, his
     role in uncovering the visa scam would lead to people  attributing  to
     him pro-Aristide opinions because Aristide was associated with helping
     the poor, and drew support from poor areas.  He was  not  in  fact  an
     Aristide activist and had no connections with Aristide.

  6. It is worth pointing out that the Tribunal based its decision,  as  it
     then thought it was constrained  to  do,  upon  the  situation  as  at
     November 1993.  It ignored the implications, for someone who was  seen
     as being at risk as a perceived Aristide supporter, of the  return  to
     power of Aristide in 1994.  Aristide had been out of Haiti since  1991
     when a coup had removed him  from  power;   he  had  taken  over  from
     President Naumphy in 1989.

  7. By a letter dated 25 September 1996, the Secretary  of  State  granted
     refugee status and leave to remain from May 1990  to  September  1997.
     In January 1999, the Appellant was granted Indefinite Leave to Remain.
      The deportation order was in effect revoked.

  8. Meanwhile, and this is an aspect of timing upon which Mr Blake QC  for
     the Appellant put some weight, the Appellant  had  been  convicted  of
     further offences.  In February 1995, he was convicted of attempting to
     obtain money by deception, using a stolen cheque book,  for  which  he
     was put on  probation  for  12  months.   In  November  1997,  he  was
     convicted of wounding;  he said that it was in retaliation against two
     men who were attacking him.  He was sent to prison for three years but
     was released in August 1998.

  9. In July 1999, he was sentenced  to  fifteen  months  imprisonment  for
     possession of an imitation firearm which he said he had  when  he  was
     intending to visit the house of someone who was alleged to have  raped
     his girlfriend.  He  intended  to  frighten  him.   This  offence  was
     committed  while  he  was  on  licence.   He   was   recommended   for
     deportation. He was released in July 2000, but was  immediately  taken
     into  immigration  detention.   The  Secretary  of  State   signed   a
     deportation order against him in July 2000, and it was served  on  him
     with removal directions in  August  2000.   He  was  granted  bail  in
     December 2000, by which time  he  had  appealed  against  the  removal
     directions and the refusal to revoke the deportation order.

 10. He moved to Cornwall and married very shortly  after  he  was  granted
     bail.  In December 2001, as  a  result  he  said  of  constant  racial
     harassment and abuse about which the police did nothing, he confronted
     one of the perpetrators with an air pistol, which led  to  charges  of
     possessing a firearm while banned from doing so, possessing a  firearm
     while committing an offence, assault occasioning  actual  bodily  harm
     and possession of a class B drug.  He was later detained;  and  it  is
     said tried to commit suicide on a number of occasions.

 11. He committed a hotel burglary in February 2002 for which  he  received
     three months in March 2002.  He had by this time been taken back  into
     immigration detention.  The various December 2001 offences were  dealt
     with in September 2002.  Only the charge of possession  of  a  firearm
     while banned  was  proceeded  with  and  led  to  a  conviction.   The
     Appellant received a six month sentence suspended for  twelve  months.
     This sentence  was  imposed  shortly  before  the  hearing  before  Mr
     Watkins.  The Appellant was released on bail in February 2004.

The appeals

 12. Mr Watkins had before him three appeals, one  in  respect  of  removal
     directions under section 17  of  the  Immigration  Act  1971,  one  in
     respect of the refusal to revoke the deportation order  under  section
     69(4)(b) of the 1999 Act on asylum grounds and one under section 65 on
     human rights grounds.  He said that the issues  before  him  were  (1)
     whether the Secretary of State's contention was correct  that  Article
     1C(5) of the Refugee Convention, the cessation provision, now  applied
     in the light of current circumstances in Haiti so that asylum need  no
     longer be afforded to the Appellant;  (2)  if  incorrect,  whether  he
     could nonetheless be returned  to  Haiti  because  the  provisions  of
     Article 33(2) of the Convention applied so as to exclude him from  its
     protection because of his crimes;  (3) whether returning him to  Haiti
     would breach his human rights under Articles 2, 3, 5 or 8 of the ECHR.



 13. Mr  Watkins  concluded  that  on  the  balance  of  probabilities  the
     circumstances had changed  in  Haiti  since  the  Appellant  had  been
     granted asylum such that he could no longer refuse to avail himself of
     its protection.  He was an incorrigible criminal whose crimes overall,
     including those committed before 1997, were so serious that he  was  a
     danger to the community and fell outside the scope  of  Article  33(1)
     because he fell within Article 33(2).  Article 3  ECHR  would  not  be
     breached because the period of detention  which  the  Appellant  would
     face would be unlikely to exceed  a  month,  appalling  though  prison
     conditions were.  He had failed to establish that he could not receive
     the necessary  treatment  for  his  psychiatric  condition,  PTSD  and
     depression.  Having considered  the  balance  to  be  struck  for  the
     purposes of the revocation of a deportation order, he  concluded  that
     the refusal to revoke it  was  proportionate.   There  was  no  appeal
     against the deportation order  itself.   The  relationship  which  the
     Appellant had with his daughter was so limited that  any  interference
     with it which there might be was  not  disproportionate.   The  appeal
     against removal directions as such was dismissed, insofar  as  it  was
     before the Adjudicator, because there was no  alternative  destination
     proposed.

 14. This appeal to the Tribunal is on fact and law, and in accordance with
     the Tribunal's understanding of that  jurisdiction,  it  has  accepted
     evidence which was not before the Adjudicator  and  which  related  to
     changes of circumstances in Haiti, and in particular the departure  of
     President Aristide whose return to power in 1994 had been seen by  the
     Adjudicator as very significant for his conclusions about  the  change
     in circumstances since the previous Tribunal decision in 1995.  It was
     also common  ground  that  the  appeal  provisions  of  the  1999  Act
     continued to apply notwithstanding their repeal and replacement by the
     2002  Act,  by  virtue  of  paragraph  6(4)  of  Schedule  2  to   the
     Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (Commencement No 4) Order
     2003 SI 754.

 15. Mr Gulvin reluctantly asked for an adjournment at the  outset  of  the
     appeal,  because  although  he  had  worked  through  the  weekend  on
     voluminous background material, he was not fully  prepared  so  as  to
     provide the level of assistance which he would have wished.   He  said
     that the relevant dates and directions had not been picked up as  they
     should have been.

 16. We rejected that application.  Although Mr Gulvin had not seen a small
     quantity of new material, it did not alter the picture  significantly.
     He was  given  the  opportunity  to  provide  written  submissions  in
     fourteen days after the close of the hearing.

 17. Nothing during the hearing of the appeal, and the absence  of  written
     submissions from him, whilst the Appellant submitted his on 28th  June
     2004, has caused us to conclude that greater time for him  to  prepare
     would have added significantly to his comments on the material.   This
     appeal had already been overlong in the appeal system.  We regret  the
     delay  in  the  production  of  this  determination,  which   is   the
     consequence of workload and availability.

Cessation

 18. We turn to the first issue which is whether the Adjudicator  erred  in
     concluding that  there  had  been  such  a  change  in  circumstances,
     particularly in the light of the present situation  in  Haiti,  as  to
     enable the Secretary  of  State  to  discharge  the  burden  which  he
     conceded he bore to show that Article 1C(5) applied.  This provides:

           "He can no longer, because the circumstances in connection  with
           which he has been recognized as a refugee have ceased to  exist,
           continue to refuse to avail himself of  the  protection  of  the
           country of his nationality."

 19. The Adjudicator referred to the background material, pointing out that
     the UNHCR Representative's letter of October 2000 had  said  that  the
     general situation in Haiti was not so  fundamentally  and  permanently
     changed that the cessation clause could  be  generally  applied.   The
     UNHCR letter of March 2000 said that the changes were not  durable  or
     deep although the election of Preval  as  successor  to  Aristide  had
     suggested a fundamental change.  There had been a serious,  continuing
     constitutional crisis since 1997 and despite the UN Mission the police
     and  justice  systems  were  fragile  or  functioned  badly;    prison
     conditions  and  detention  practices  were  unacceptable,   political
     violence and human rights abuses had grown.  It was  insufficient,  as
     the Adjudicator noted and did not disagree with, for general return of
     refugees.

 20. The position of  the  Appellant,  however,  individually  had  changed
     according to the UNHCR.  His past association with the US  and  street
     children no longer carried the risks which they had done in 1993;  the
     supporters of Aristide did not face in general a risk  of  persecution
     because of their actual or imputed views.  It was the Appellant's past
     association with the US rather than any overt activity  which  led  to
     the  imputation  to  him  of  pro-Aristide  views.   The   Adjudicator
     commented that there was now even less reason to  suppose  that  there
     was a real risk of persecution now  that  Aristide  had  been  elected
     President.

 21. The Adjudicator also referred to what the UNHCR said about  the  other
     fear which the Appellant had expressed, which was that he would be  at
     risk as a result of his association  with  the  attach�s  or  Ton  Ton
     Macoute.  Although the risk might have diminished, the UNHCR said that
     it could not exclude the possibility that the Appellant  might  become
     the target of mob violence. The Appellant  had  not  had  a  prominent
     role;  only a small circle might recall his role as an  attach�.   The
     Appellant had relied upon a Report of Dr Marshrons of  September  2002
     which led her to suggest that  the  Appellant  would  be  at  risk  of
     persecution because of his actual or perceived  past  links  with  the
     attaches or Ton Ton Macoute.  This would in turn lead him to  be  seen
     as hostile to Aristide.

 22. The Adjudicator commented that the  Appellant  had  not  been  granted
     asylum on that basis, saying that the claim to fear persecution as  an
     alleged attach� or Ton Ton Macoute had been rejected by the  Tribunal.
     He continued:

           "16.  With the elapse of seven years, it  is  even  less  likely
                 that the appellant would face any risk of persecution for a
                 Convention  reason  on  account  of   that   alleged   past
                 association than he did in January 1995 when  the  Tribunal
                 heard his case.  As a supporter of President Aristide, real
                 or  perceived,  there  is  no  reason  for  him   to   fear
                 persecution by the authorities in Haiti.  Were opponents of
                 the President to attempt to persecute him, I  am  satisfied
                 that, despite the state of Haitian society and  made  plain
                 in the objective reports, he could look to the  authorities
                 for protection.  Nothing in the evidence satisfies me  that
                 the government would be unable or unwilling to afford it to
                 him.  Indeed, the objective reports including  that  of  Dr
                 Marshrons refer to the policy of 'zero tolerance' of  crime
                 by the Aristide regime.  I am, therefore,  satisfied  on  a
                 balance  of  probabilities  that  the   circumstances   now
                 prevailing in Haiti are such  that  the  grounds  on  which
                 asylum was granted  have  ceased  to  exist  and  that  the
                 appellant can no longer refuse  to  avail  himself  of  the
                 protection of his own country."

 23. Mr Blake submitted that the effect of Article 1C (5)  was  to  require
     the Secretary of State to  show  that  there  had  been  a  change  of
     circumstances which was fundamental, durable and stable.  It  was  not
     enough to show that if the asylum claim were now being considered  for
     the first time it would fail, even though he did not accept that  that
     was the position here.  The clause could not be invoked simply because
     the basis for the grant of asylum had  disappeared,  if  it  had  been
     replaced by another basis for the  grant  of  asylum.   The  cessation
     clause was usually applied where the change  was  by  its  nature  one
     which affected general groups of refugees, though it could be  invoked
     where particular personal  circumstances  satisfied  the  test.   This
     approach is reflected in paragraph 135 of the UNHCR  Handbook  and  in
     other UNHCR material, in particular the 2003 UNHCR Guidelines  on  the
     application of the cessation clauses.

 24. Mr Gulvin submitted that this was a case about the circumstances of an
     individual  and,  contrary  to  the  way  Mr  Blake   understood   his
     submissions, we did not understand him to be taking significant  issue
     with the need for a durable change which removed  the  basis  for  the
     persecution.  His argument was that he could demonstrate just  such  a
     change for this individual and there had been  no  significant  change
     since the Adjudicator's determination, a determination which was to be
     supported.

 25. We do not see it as therefore necessary to rehearse all  the  material
     on the general issues about Article 1C(5) which we were  offered.   We
     simply make the following comments, which  indicate  sufficiently  our
     real reservations about the  UNHCR  guidelines,  which  appear  to  go
     considerably beyond the  Convention  along  the  lines  of  the  wider
     humanitarian concerns which it pursues.

 26. Paragraph 10 of the guidelines deals with the  fundamental  nature  of
     the change, but, to us, that adjective  is  really  no  more  than  an
     encapsulation of the wording  of  the  clause  itself  because  it  is
     treated as requiring the changes to have addressed the causes  of  the
     displacement which led to the grant of refugee  status  in  the  first
     place.

 27. This requirement is emphasised by the need for the change to  be  such
     that the refugee  can  no  longer  refuse  to  avail  himself  of  the
     protection of his country of nationality.  The guidelines in paragraph
     15 say that this means that protection must therefore be effective and
     available.  We are not sure that that must be so in every case.  There
     may be no or rather less need to focus on protection where there is no
     longer any  persecutory  treatment  to  which  the  refugee  would  be
     subject.  The extensive scope of protection which is to  be  found  in
     paragraph  15   and   which   includes   a   functioning   government,
     administrative and legal system as well as adequate infrastructure  to
     enable the residents to exercise their rights including the right to a
     basic livelihood, considerably overstates the Convention requirement.

 28. We add that the guidelines,  paragraph  16,  should  not  be  read  as
     requiring that the indicators of change to which it refers all have to
     be in place before the cessation clause  can  be  invoked.   They  are
     indicators of both change and of  the  factors  which  show  that  the
     previously persecutory  conditions  will  not  foreseeably  return  to
     displace the refugee again.  They do not require a particular level of
     good and democratic governance to be achieved.  It is the avoidance of
     a predictable return to the conditions of persecution  which  must  be
     shown as a result of the changes relied on.  It  is  for  that  reason
     that the UNHCR does not see  the  clause  being  used  in  respect  of
     individuals usually, because it is  changes  which  affect  groups  of
     refugees which will be the more enduring and fundamental.

 29. Paragraph 13 deals  with  the  enduring  and  stable  nature  of  that
     fundamental change.  We agree that temporary changes in a situation of
     volatility do not suffice.  Time should be allowed for the changes  to
     consolidate, so as to show their durability.

 30. Mr Blake made two  submission  about  the  Adjudicator's  conclusions:
     first, he had not taken adequate account of background material before
     him including a letter from Mr Geilenfeld;  second, there had  been  a
     significant  change  in  circumstances  in  February  2004  with   the
     departure of Aristide, a change which also  served  to  emphasise  the
     volatility and the lack of functioning state even at the time when the
     Adjudicator was dealing with  matters.   It  was  suggested,  but  not
     really pursued and we do  not  accept,  that  the  Adjudicator  really
     treated the appeal as a re-investigation of the original claim.

 31. Mr Blake submitted that the material showed that although Aristide had
     returned  after  the  Tribunal's  1993  date  of  assessment  for  its
     determination, there had been a steady decline in the  functioning  of
     the Haitian state and in its legal and law enforcement organs markedly
     accelerating  after  1997.   Thereafter  human  rights  abuses  become
     increasingly widespread;  the  zero  tolerance  police  policy  was  a
     licence or code for extra-judicial killings  and  punishments,  police
     corruption and politicisation in the interests of Aristide.  By  2003,
     the state had ceased effectively to exist.  If the Appellant had  been
     pursued as a former attach� or a perceived Ton Ton Macoute,  he  could
     have received no protection at all but  would  rather  have  been  the
     target of Aristide thugs.

 32. Mr Blake drew our attention to a report of 2000 by Merrill Smith, a US
     Attorney with a particular interest in Haiti.  But we did not find the
     list of incidents particularly illuminating though illustrative of law
     and order problems of some gravity.  It showed political  instability,
     corruption, violence and electoral fraud.  Dr  Marshrons'  reports  of
     2000 and 2002 show the violent consequences of the  "popular  justice"
     or "zero tolerance" policy of Aristide and that it  was  used  against
     political opponents, journalists and ordinary citizens in a way  which
     encouraged violence and the breakdown of law and  order,  and  of  any
     semblance  of  a  non-political  police.   It  encouraged   gangs   of
     politically allied thugs.  The judiciary became politicised.

 33. Mr Gulvin submitted that it was necessary to focus on the  reason  why
     asylum had been granted and that the background material supported the
     carefully considered views of the  Adjudicator.   As  the  Adjudicator
     pointed out, Dr Marshrons' concern was not for the Appellant perceived
     as an Aristide supporter but for the Appellant who, seen as  a  former
     attach� or Ton Ton Macoute, would be at the risk of  mob  violence  or
     revenge attacks against which there would be no protection provided by
     the state apparatus, such as it was, because it was under the sway  of
     Aristide.

 34. We now deal with the  Adjudicator's  determination.   The  Adjudicator
     sets out correctly the gist of what the UNHCR said, which included the
     comment that the Appellant was not believed to face any  serious  risk
     of harm related to imputed pro-Aristide views  dating  back  to  1989.
     There was a risk in relation to those few who might recall him  as  an
     attach�;  former Macoutistes allegedly still  operated  as  assassins.
     Old antagonists might still bear  a  grudge  since  they  could  still
     remember  him  in  1994  according  to  Mr  Geilenfeld.   But  as  the
     Adjudicator pointed out that had not been the basis for the  grant  of
     asylum.

 35. He approached the cessation provision on the basis that it was the way
     in which the Appellant, through his association with the USA  and  the
     orphanage, would be perceived as an Aristide supporter which had  been
     the basis of the grant of asylum.  To him  the  question  was  whether
     there had been such a change in those circumstances that the Appellant
     could no longer refuse the protection of Haiti.  There  had  been  and
     was no actual involvement with Aristide by way of political  activity.
     There was no grant of asylum because of the risk  that  the  Appellant
     would be seen as a former  attach�,  or  misperceived  as  a  Ton  Ton
     Macoute.  It appears to us that while the  Tribunal  in  1995  thought
     that the Appellant might be at some risk from the guards whose scam he
     had exposed,  that  risk  of  a  revenge  attack  did  not  furnish  a
     Convention reason.

 36. It is right that  the  Adjudicator  does  not  refer  to  the  emailed
     statement from Mr Geilenfeld dated 1st October 2002.  This  says  that
     the Appellant would return to a place without family or job, and where
     his life would be in danger from "mob  types"  who  had  a  very  long
     memory.  Other former attach�s were still being murdered and  most  of
     those with whom the Appellant used to associate had been  murdered  or
     had fled the country.  This too does not  relate  to  the  basis  upon
     which asylum had been granted.

 37. If there had been no changes to the situation as at the time when  the
     Adjudicator was considering matters, we would not have interfered with
     his assessment of fact and degree. We would not have felt impelled  to
     disagree.  Putting the matter very simply, the basis for the grant  of
     asylum was that the Appellant would be at risk as a  result  of  being
     perceived as  pro-Aristide.   Once  Aristide  was  in  power,  or  his
     supporters were, there was no real risk  to  the  Appellant  for  that
     reason.  Even though the state was functioning  badly,  he  would  not
     have been at a real risk of persecution because of those imputed views
     and would have been supported by the supporters of  Aristide,  however
     unpleasant they might be.   That  was  the  UNHCR  position  as  well.
     Aristide's return to power had been a fundamental change;  it  removed
     the basis of the persecution risk to this  individual  underlying  the
     grant of asylum.  There was no real evidence at  that  stage  to  show
     that the rule of Aristide supporters was to  end  shortly.   It  would
     have  been  possible  to  take  the  view  that  the  instability  and
     volatility of Haiti had already been demonstrated so that no political
     future could be predicted with the necessary degree of certainty,  but
     that is not a view to which the Tribunal feels impelled to come in the
     absence of hindsight.  We do not accept that it is a legal requirement
     for the operation of the cessation clause that  there  be  functioning
     institutions  and  rights  provisions,  as  the  indicators   in   the
     guidelines appeared to require.  We agree, however, that  the  absence
     of such institutions makes  the  prediction  of  stable  and  enduring
     change a more fragile exercise of judgement.

 38. We should refer at this stage to the arguments about the risk  arising
     out of the  perception  of  the  Appellant  as  a  former  attach�  or
     Macoutiste.  They were not quite formulated in this way  because  they
     were lumped in indiscriminately with the risk as a perceived  Aristide
     supporter.  But in 1995 the Tribunal concluded, not that there was  no
     risk, but that the risk was of revenge attacks which did not give rise
     to a Convention reason for protection.  It did not consider that  this
     risk might be  occasioned  by  any  imputed  political  opinion.   The
     Adjudicator did not reject the  risks  as  claimed  by  the  Appellant
     before him, rather he treated them as irrelevant because they did  not
     form the basis of the grant of asylum.  On the evidence which we  have
     set  out,  the  Appellant,  as  at  the  date  of  the   Adjudicator's
     determination, may have been facing  a  real  risk  in  that  respect.
     Although the evidence about such attach�s is sparse, the Geilenfeld e-
     mail is relevant as is the fact that such individuals might be seen as
     hostile to the Aristide cause.  Where the original risk  or  cause  of
     persecution ceases but is replaced by another Convention  risk,  there
     may  have  been  a  cessation  and  in  effect  a  fresh   claim   for
     adjudication, but removal would continue  to  breach  the  Convention,
     which is  the  way  United  Kingdom  law  normally  engages  with  the
     Convention.  However, in view  of  other  conclusions  which  we  have
     reached it is not necessary to analyse the degree of risk and  whether
     it arises for a Convention reason.

 39. We now turn to the evidence of the changes to the position  after  the
     Adjudicator's  determination.   The  September  2003  report  from  Dr
     Marshrons describes a  further  deterioration  in  press  freedom,  an
     increase in zero tolerance killings and police brutality.   There  was
     an atmosphere of widespread insecurity and violence;  the institutions
     of  government  were  crumbling.   The  rule  of  law   was   brazenly
     disregarded; the police and populist organisations were linked to many
     human rights violations.  Special Brigades  appeared  which  had  many
     resemblances to the attach�s system and were responsible for violence,
     thefts, arrests and disappearances.  There is no mention  that  former
     attach�s were at any particular risk although Dr Marshrons  says  that
     the risk to the Appellant in that respect had diminished but  had  not
     been eliminated.

 40. The US State Department Report for 2003,  which  Mr  Gulvin  produced,
     highlighted the continuing increase  in  extra-judicial  killings  and
     assaults under the guise of the zero tolerance  policy.   The  use  of
     attach�s arising out of that policy was reported though these are not,
     or not necessarily, the same individuals who were the attach�s  during
     the Naumphy regime.  Pro-Aristide thugs were left unchecked to  attack
     his opponents in demonstrations.  Human rights abuses were rife.

 41. Dr Marshrons' report of May  2004  described  the  armed  insurrection
     which had developed in late 2003 and early 2004 led by former soldiers
     now hostile to Aristide. He had been forced to leave in February 2004;
      his supporters saw the intervention of the USA in his departure as  a
     hostile act.  Although there had been a Political Transition  Pact  in
     April and a multinational interim force, there were large  numbers  of
     active armed groups including some loyal to Aristide.  The police were
     ineffective  against  even  the  ordinary  criminal  gangs  which  had
     increased in number;  there was no effective judicial system.  The new
     leaders had bad human rights records and were keen to prosecute  those
     abuses of Aristide while ignoring those of 1991-4 when he was  not  in
     power.  Violence, random and targeted,  was  widespread.   There  were
     attacks on opposition supporters and  those  who  supported  Aristide,
     including those who had been officials  or  employees.   There  was  a
     higher  degree  of  instability  than  before.   Anti-Aristide  forces
     operated with impunity.  His supporters had refused to participate  in
     the government positions offered to them  because  of  the  continuing
     attacks.

 42.  This  general  picture  was  repeated  in  the  reports  of   Amnesty
     International and Human Rights Watch.

 43. The UNHCR Washington Office said in a  letter  of  October  2003  that
     whilst the Appellant's imputed pro-Aristide  views  were  unlikely  to
     cause him serious risks, he could be at risk because of his role as an
     attach�.  The general condition of Haiti was  marked  by  a  sense  of
     hopelessness, increasing violence, a climate  of  impunity  for  those
     acting in  the  interests  of  Aristide,  and  increasing  and  unjust
     detention and inhumane treatment in  gaol  for  those  returned  after
     having committed crimes  abroad.   In  a  letter  from  the  UNHCR  UK
     Representative of May 2004, it said that the atmosphere of impunity in
     Haiti continued, but that now it was favourable to those who  attacked
     Aristide supporters.  A myriad of armed groups held  sway  in  various
     parts of the country, there was no effective police force  to  counter
     them and the other institutions of the state were inactive.  There was
     no prospect of this climate of uncertainty  ending  immediately.   The
     Appellant would be particularly vulnerable in view of his history, and
     having no family or other support  to  help  him  integrate  into  the
     unstable society of Haiti.

 44. We take the view that, judged as of now, the Secretary  of  State  has
     failed to show that  the  requirements  of  Article  1C(5)  have  been
     satisfied.  When exercising the error of fact and law jurisdiction  in
     an asylum case, we are obliged in line with Ravichandran  to  look  at
     the situation as at the date of our determination.  The very cause  of
     the grant of asylum was the imputation of pro-Aristide  views  and  an
     association with the USA.  Whilst there was a period when Aristide was
     in power and that risk had  been  eliminated,  that  is  not  now  the
     position.  Even taking a narrower view of the  Article  than  we  have
     done, it is clear that the circumstances which underlay the  grant  of
     asylum have not ceased to exist;  and those circumstances mean that he
     cannot avail himself of the protection of the state in Haiti  such  as
     it may be.  Aristide supporters are under routine  and  random  attack
     and are not protected save to the extent  that  his  armed  gangs  can
     assist.  He risked being perceived  as  an  Aristide  supporter.   The
     passage of time and changes in  regime  have  resurrected  that  risk.
     Indeed,  if  he  was  perceived  by  Aristide  supporters  as   having
     associations with the USA, that is unlikely to be helpful  to  him  in
     seeking their help, because they see it as having  betrayed  Aristide.
     It is difficult to ignore the risk that he would also  be  seen  as  a
     former attach� who would thus at the very least not be certain of  the
     protection even of Aristide gangs.   In  any  event  such  sources  of
     protection are not what the Convention has in mind  in  the  cessation
     provisions.  The situation is  so  unstable,  the  breaches  of  human
     rights on all sides so common that the  conditions  for  cessation  of
     refugee status do not exist.  We reject the suggestion that there  has
     not been a real change since the departure of Aristide so  far  as  it
     affects this Appellant.

 45. We have not considered for these purposes the question of  any  period
     of detention and the  conditions  of  detention  which  may  face  the
     Appellant were he to be returned.  We  have  considered  the  position
     solely on the basis of what he would face were  he  to  be  at  large.
     However, once it is accepted that there is a real risk that  he  would
     be seen  as  an  Aristide  supporter,  the  question  of  whether  the
     Appellant  would  face  detention  on  return  and,  if  so,  in  what
     circumstances, becomes a live one for the cessation clause.  It cannot
     be considered on the basis upon which the Adjudicator dealt  with  it,
     which was that he would only be detained for a  month  or  so,  as  an
     ordinary deportee.

 46. The position as noted by the Adjudicator was that  those  deported  to
     Haiti, including those who had lost their refugee  status  because  of
     criminal convictions, were kept in prison for indefinite periods.  But
     the average period of detention for deportees had decreased by 2001 to
     about a month.  Conditions were very poor, overcrowded,  filthy,  with
     inadequate hygiene, healthcare, food and water or exercise.  Detention
     appeared to be routine for deportees though.

 47. Subsequent material from Dr Marshrons in September 2003,  but  drawing
     on information from 2002 from Human Rights Watch,  National  Coalition
     for Haitian Rights and a UN  Expert's  visit,  referred  to  the  very
     overcrowded state  of  the  prisons,  the  lack  of  food  leading  to
     malnutrition, poor sanitation, diseases,  dilapidated  buildings,  the
     absence of sufficient beds or exercise, and  the  abuse  of  prisoners
     which included the withholding of medical treatment.  There were  long
     delays pending trial and  sentences  were  absurdly  severe.   The  US
     Immigration and Naturalization Service reporting  in  2002  said  that
     criminal deportees were routinely imprisoned on return.  Detention for
     three months was common if there was then a close  family  member  who
     could take responsibility for the deportee, in effect standing  surety
     with his own liberty for his good behaviour.  A family was also useful
     for bribing guards to release someone and for providing  food  and  so
     on.  In the absence of a family member willing to take responsibility,
     it could be many months before a criminal deportee was released;   the
     USINS said ten months, UNCHR spoke of years.  Its report for 2003 also
     spoke of improvements in certain respects.

 48. However, by her  May  2004  Report,  Dr  Marshrons  was  referring  to
     complete disarray in the prison system with  many  escapes,  releases,
     and the UN said that many facilities were not usable  because  of  the
     risk to prisoners and staff.   Overcrowded  police  cells  were  being
     used.  An important  part  of  the  reconstruction  and  stabilisation
     programmes was to improve  the  prison  facilities,  as  part  of  the
     restoration of law and order.

 49. There was no evidence as to how deportees were  now  treated,  perhaps
     because there was very little experience post February 2004.

 50. If we make the assumption, which we have to  do  for  these  purposes,
     that the Appellant would be returned  to  the  chaotic  conditions  in
     Haiti, it seems to us that some sort of  functioning  state  apparatus
     for his reception at the port or airport must be assumed.  He would be
     returned, absent any contrary material as someone who was  a  criminal
     deportee, even if there were no mention of  his  refugee  status.   It
     would be wrong on the material to  conclude  that  the  state  was  so
     broken down that it would be unable to detain him, but rather that  it
     would be able to carry on as before in 2003. He would be detained even
     as an ordinary criminal deportee without family  for  many  months  in
     very poor conditions.  We cannot assume or conclude that Mr Geilenfeld
     would be in a position  to  risk  offering  assistance  at  all.   The
     Appellant would be asked questions, with no sense of restraint on  his
     interrogator's part, about his origins in Haiti, and his  reasons  for
     going to the United Kingdom.  There is at least a real risk  that  his
     association with the orphanage would come out, and that  he  would  be
     considered as a possible Aristide supporter by those in charge of  the
     state's security and enforcement  apparatus.   Were  that  to  happen,
     there is a real risk that he would be killed or  very  seriously  ill-
     treated, regardless of the general conditions in prison.  But he would
     at best receive the worst of the general conditions; and whatever  may
     be the true position in relation to prison conditions  and  Article  3
     generally, and whether or not they  would  by  themselves  breach  his
     Article 3 rights, they add  powerfully  to  the  conclusion  that  the
     cessation clause cannot now apply to him.

 51. This position is reinforced by his  medical  condition.   Briefly,  it
     appears to have been accepted by the Adjudicator that he is  suffering
     from chronic PTSD and depression.   Psychiatric  reports  prepared  in
     part in  connection  with  his  court  appearances  refer  to  suicide
     attempts in and out of prison.  Anti-depressants have been  prescribed
     with some success.  Part of his depression relates to a fear of return
     to Haiti.  However, the conclusions  of  the  Adjudicator  as  to  the
     availability of medical treatment in Haiti for depression and PTSD  do
     not hold good for someone in detention.  The evidence shows that there
     is no real prospect of him receiving any such  medication  in  present
     circumstances in prison.

Refoulement

 52. Accordingly, we approach  the  second  issue,  refoulement  under  the
     Convention on the basis that we accept that the Appellant is  still  a
     refugee.   Article  33(1)  prevents  the  return  of  a   refugee   to
     territories where he would be at a risk of persecution.  Article 33(2)
     provides:

           "The benefit of the  present  provision  may  not,  however,  be
           claimed by a refugee  whom  there  are  reasonable  grounds  for
           regarding as a danger to the security of the country in which he
           is, or who, having been convicted  by  a  final  judgment  of  a
           particularly  serious  crime,  constitutes  a  danger   to   the
           community of that country."

     This removes the protection against non-refoulement from refugees.


 53. The Adjudicator concluded in paragraph 18:

           "The appellant committed not one  but  several  serious  crimes.
           They ranged from attempted deception through burglary to  crimes
           of violence including actual bodily harm and wounding.   He  has
           been in prison a number of times.   Two  of  the  offences  were
           committed  after  the  1997  trial  judge's  recommendation  for
           deportation.  The  latest  pre-sentence  report  of  March  2002
           assessed the risk of re-0ffending at a moderate level  and  said
           that the appellant wished to settle  down.   Despite  that,  his
           whole history is one of  repeated  re-offending.   Moreover,  he
           appears to have been  less  than  truthful  with  the  Probation
           Officer, suggesting that he lived in a stable relationship  with
           his wife.  Mrs Belvue told the Trainee  Probation  Officer  that
           she considered the relationship at an end and  that  she  wanted
           nothing more to do with him.  He also appears to have given  the
           Probation Officer the impression that  his  'immigration  status
           was stable'  and  that  one  attempt  to  deport  him  had  been
           unsuccessful.  That was despite the order signed on 31 July 2000
           and the removal directions of 21 August 2000 of both of which he
           must have been aware.  The appellant, in my judgment and in  the
           words of the UNHCR Deputy Representative in  his  letter  relied
           upon by Miss Naik is covered by the words,


                 'one  or  several  convictions  are  symptomatic   of   the
                 criminal, incorrigible nature of the person  against  which
                 Article 33(2) action is contemplated.'


           I am satisfied that the offences for  which  the  appellant  was
           convicted and in particular that of wounding which  led  to  the
           recommendation for deportation are of a serious  nature.   I  do
           not accept that  those  before  1997  should  be  excluded  from
           consideration.  There is no doctrine of estoppel in  immigration
           law and, in my judgment, the respondent is  entitled  to  regard
           them as pointing to a pattern of incorrigible criminality  which
           taken with the serious wounding offence  placed  the  appellant,
           even if he is still at risk of persecution in Haiti for  a  1951
           Convention reason, outwith the protection of that Convention  as
           an exception under Article 33(2).


           ...


           As the UNHCR says, what is required in applying Article 33(2) is
           a balancing exercise.  I am satisfied from the  evidence  before
           me that the appellant is a danger to the community of the United
           Kingdom by virtue of his incorrigible criminality.   I  am  also
           satisfied that the situation he as an individual would  face  if
           returned to Haiti is such that he would not face persecution  on
           account of a 1951 convention reason and in  particular  not  for
           the reason for  which  refugee  status  was  originally  granted
           following the  determination  of  his  appeal  in  1995  by  the
           Immigration Appeal Tribunal.  The appeal on the grounds that the
           appellant is not outwith Article 33 of the  1951  Convention  is
           dismissed."

 54. Although the Adjudicator considered this provision on the  basis  that
     the cessation provision did not apply  and  carried  out  a  balancing
     exercise between the risk  to  the  community  and  the  risk  to  the
     individual, it is not clear what assumptions he made about the risk to
     the individual.  He treated the Appellant as still being  entitled  to
     refugee status, seemingly (paragraph 17) on the basis  that  he  still
     had a  well-founded  fear  of  persecution  as  a  perceived  Aristide
     supporter.  Yet he also said in paragraph 18 in the  very  context  of
     the balance that the Appellant would not face persecution  on  return.
     This appears to be illogical.

 55. Mr Blake submitted that the crimes did not show the  requisite  degree
     of severity to come within the scope of "a particularly serious crime"
     which showed that he constituted a "danger to  the  community".   This
     had to be seen as a  requirement  akin  in  gravity  to  a  threat  to
     national security.  The offences, when analysed, did  not  reach  that
     threshold although in principle some such offences might.   They  were
     different from homicides, dealing in hard  drugs,  gang  violence  and
     robbery.  The Secretary of State had moreover granted Leave to  Remain
     to the Appellant as a refugee in  September  1996  and  January  1999,
     revoking a previous  deportation  order  and  those  earlier  offences
     should not now found this exclusion and the  refusal  to  revoke  this
     deportation order.  Indefinite Leave to Remain was granted  after  the
     most serious of  his  offences  for  which  he  received  his  longest
     sentence of three years, for  wounding.   In  reality,  there  was  no
     increasing gravity of offending over time.  There had been no  further
     convictions.  His longest sentence had been three years.  He  had  had
     seven sentences in fourteen and a half years.   The  UNHCR  letter  of
     15th November 1999, which from the  information  available,  concurred
     that the  totality  of  the  convictions  reached  the  threshold  for
     "particularly serious crimes" might have been based on  no  more  than
     the mere name of the offence rather  than  on  the  substance  of  the
     criminal behaviour.  In any event, the UNHCR emphasised the narrowness
     the exclusion clause, the need for great caution about its application
     and the balance which had to be struck between the danger to the  host
     community of his remaining and the risk  to  the  Appellant  upon  his
     return.

 56. Mr Blake also dealt with the provisions of section 72 of the 2002 Act,
     which he said could not apply to this appeal.  Section 72  applies  to
     the construction and application of  Article  33(2).   Subsection  (1)
     provides:

           "This section applies for the purpose of  the  construction  and
           application  of  Article  33(2)  of   the   Refugee   Convention
           (exclusion from protection).

 57. Subsection (2) says:

           "A person shall be presumed to have been convicted  by  a  final
           judgment of a particularly serious crime  and  to  constitute  a
           danger to the community of the United Kingdom if he is-
           (a)   convicted in the United Kingdom, and
           (b)   sentenced to a period of  imprisonment  of  at  least  two
      years."

 58. Subsection (6) says that the presumption as to danger is rebuttable.

 59. Subsection (8) is also material and provides:

           "Section 34(1) of the Anti-terrorism,  Crime  and  Security  Act
           2001 (c. 24) (no need to consider gravity of fear or  threat  of
           persecution) applies for the purpose of  considering  whether  a
           presumption mentioned in subsection (6) has been rebutted as  it
           applies for the purpose of considering whether Article 33(2)  of
           the Refugee Convention applies."

 60. Section 34(1) of the  Anti-Terrorism,  Crime  and  Security  Act  2001
     reads:

           "Articles 1(F) and 33(2) of the Refugee Convention  (exclusions:
           war criminals, national security, &c.) shall  not  be  taken  to
           require consideration of the gravity of-
           (a)   events or fear by virtue of which Article  1(A)  would  or
                 might apply to a person if Article 1(F) did not apply, or
           (b)   a threat by reason of which Article 33(1) would  or  might
                 apply to a person if Article 33(2) did not apply."

 62. Section 72 of the 2002 Act was brought into force on 10 February 2003,
     after the Adjudicator's determination in this case.  The  Commencement
     Order SI 2003 No 1 contains no transitional provisions.  Section 34 of
     the 2001 Act came into force on 14 December 2001 by section 127, after
     the appeal against the Secretary of State decision had been lodged but
     before the Adjudicator's hearing.

 63. If section  72(2)  were  consistent  with  international  obligations,
     submitted Mr Blake, it showed for the purposes of an appeal  to  which
     it  did  not  directly  apply  what  Parliament   considered   to   be
     particularly serious.  There was only one offence which fulfilled that
     criterion, after which Indefinite Leave to Remain had been granted.

 64. Mr Blake submitted that this section could  not  apply  to  a  pending
     appeal if it cut back on the case available to the Appellant,  in  the
     absence of clear language.  He drew support from  R  (Khadir)  v  SSHD
     [2003] EWCA Civ 475, [2003] INLR  426.   Between  the  hearing  of  an
     application for Judicial Review and the Secretary of State's appeal to
     the Court of Appeal, Parliament had enacted section 67 of the 2002 Act
     which provided that section 67 was to be treated "as always having had
     effect".  It gave an extended definition to those who were  liable  to
     immigration detention, and hence broadened those who were eligible for
     temporary admission.  That new provision was clearly intended to  have
     substantive retrospective effect.  Mance LJ at paragraphs  82  and  83
     dealt with the general position in  relation  to  Acts  said  to  have
     retrospective effect:

           "82.  But the general principle is that if  a  new  Act  affects
                 substantive rights, as distinct from procedure, it will not
                 apply to proceedings which have already commenced unless  a
                 clear intention is manifested: see Colonial Sugar  Refining
                 Company Ltd v Irving [1905] AC 369 and  Attorney-General  v
                 Vernazza [1960] AC 965.


           83.   In the former case, an Act removing the right of appeal to
                 the Privy Council did not affect an  appeal  in  litigation
                 pending when the Act  was  passed  and  decided  after  its
                 passing, on the ground  that  '[t]o  deprive  a  suitor  in
                 pending litigation of an  appeal  to  a  superior  tribunal
                 which belonged to him as of right is a very different thing
                 from regulating procedure'.  In the latter case, during the
                 pendency of  an  appeal  against  an  order  restraining  a
                 vexatious litigant from commencing proceedings, an Act  was
                 passed adding to the court's power  to  restrain  vexatious
                 litigants from commencing proceedings a power  to  restrain
                 them from pursuing existing proceedings.  The Act was  held
                 to be procedural on the basis that it did not  deprive  the
                 litigant of a right to bring proper proceedings and even if
                 it had been regarded as substantive, Lord Denning said that
                 it was retrospective (at 977).  The effect  of  a  contrary
                 decision would simply have been to  require  the  Attorney-
                 General to bring fresh proceedings."

 65. Mr Blake also relied on R v SSHD ex parte Chahal [1995] 1 WLR  526  in
     which the Court of Appeal considered  whether  a  balance  had  to  be
     struck in an exclusion case.  It took the view that it did;  pp533 and
     544 per Staughton and Neill LJJ.  This showed that section  72(8)  and
     section 34 were consciously  altering  the  substantive  law  and  not
     clarifying an area of dubiety.

 66. If decisions were to be made on  a  legal  basis  with  provision  for
     appeal and further appeal, it would undermine the  rule  of  law  were
     these provisions to be brought in so as to affect this appeal, in  the
     absence of specific wording.  There  was  nothing  here  akin  to  the
     language of section 67.  The issues were  locked  into  the  1999  Act
     under which the appeal was still proceeding.  The Appellant  would  be
     adversely affected  by  the  strung  out  nature  or  happenstance  of
     judicial proceedings.

 67. Mr Gulvin argued that the sequence and totality of the  offending  met
     the requirements of Article 33 (2). They could properly be said to  be
     "particularly serious" and to show that the Appellant was a danger  to
     the community.  All the offences should be  taken  into  account.   He
     agreed  that  the  section  72  arguments  were  "difficult"  for  the
     Secretary of State.

 68. We shall consider this matter, leaving on one side for the moment  the
     effect of section 72.  First, we reject the argument that it  is  only
     the post-Indefinite Leave to Remain offences  which  should  be  taken
     into account.  Such a restriction would be wholly artificial;   it  is
     necessary to form a view about the current danger to the community and
     it would be impossible to do that  properly  with  an  eye  closed  to
     offences in the past or to do so on a different basis from  that  upon
     which the existence  of  particularly  serious  crimes  was  assessed.
     Besides, past offences may help in understanding the  significance  of
     the later offences for better or worse for either party.   It  is  the
     history and pattern of offending as a whole  which  must  be  examined
     when considering danger to the community.  We do accept that the grant
     of Indefinite Leave to  Remain  is  however  an  important  factor  in
     judging how "particularly serious" an offence was  and  how  dangerous
     the Appellant is.

 69. Second, the fact that none of the offences in  substance  are  of  the
     gravity which often underlies a deportation  order,  is  relevant  but
     there is nothing in the Convention which requires only those  offences
     to found exclusion.  The power is to be used  sparingly  but  that  is
     inherent in the wording of the clause.

 70. Third, we reject the assumption behind the submissions of Mr Blake and
     Mr Gulvin, misled by the UNHCR's misinterpretation of the  Convention,
     that a series of offences can suffice to show that a refugee has  been
     convicted of "a particularly  serious  crime".   The  Convention,  and
     section 72, refer to  "a"  particularly  serious  crime.   Of  course,
     convictions for several "particularly serious crimes"  also  suffices,
     but convictions for several "not particularly serious crimes"  do  not
     cause the protection against non-refoulement  to  be  removed.   There
     must be at least one conviction for "a  particularly  serious  crime".
     This is not a piece of pedantic focus on an indefinite  article.   The
     removal of protection is serious;  the disqualifying  offence  has  to
     attain a particular level not met by persistent low  level  offending.
     Incorrigible criminality and danger to the community do not suffice of
     themselves.  The Adjudicator approached this as if they did.

 71. As we have said, a sequence of  previous  offences  may  show  a  more
     recent one to have been "particularly serious", even though as a first
     offence it might have not reached that threshold.  It is theoretically
     possible for a subsequent offence to cause an earlier  offence  to  be
     seen, with hindsight as rather more serious than appeared at the time,
     but that is likely to be because of a subsequent more serious offence.
      All offences, whether individually  "particularly  serious"  or  not,
     will be relevant, however, to the assessment of the  danger  posed  to
     the community.  This is an  assessment  as  of  now  of  future  risk.
     Conviction of "a particularly serious crime" is essentially historic.

 72. There is only one offence which is a  candidate  for  "a  particularly
     serious crime".  That is the wounding offence of which  the  Appellant
     was convicted in 1997 and after which he received Indefinite Leave  to
     Remain.

 73. There is not much information about this and the older offences  other
     than what the Appellant said in his statement for his appeal.  He  was
     the driver on domestic burglaries for others who  entered  the  flats.
     He found a wallet and when its  owner  returned  to  reclaim  it,  the
     Appellant refused to give it back and hit the owner as he tried to get
     it back.  That was one ABH.  Another occurred when he thought  he  saw
     someone wearing an item of clothing which had been stolen from him and
     went round to his house where he knew the sister and in the course  of
     an argument hit her.  He said that the cheque fraud was an attempt  to
     get back at someone who had defrauded him.  The wounding arose when he
     went again to someone's house to sort out what he thought was a  false
     accusation of theft where two men armed with a sword and  bars  chased
     him, leading to a fight in which the Appellant  fighting  back  gashed
     one of their legs.  That is an account which is hard to reconcile with
     a conviction for wounding as opposed to an acquittal on the grounds of
     self defence.

 74. This offence, by itself or as a single offence, does not  quite  reach
     the threshold, even though it was a nasty attack, on people  in  their
     homes, and undertaken  because  the  Appellant  thought  that  he  was
     entitled to take the law into his own hands.  However, in the  context
     of the Appellant's previous offending, which involved  dishonesty  and
     violence, and an earlier occasion on which he had  gone  to  someone's
     house to deal with a perceived wrong, outside the law, it  does  reach
     that threshold.

 75. The subsequent grant of Indefinite Leave to Remain does not warrant us
     taking a different view  here.   The  grant  of  Indefinite  Leave  to
     Remain, following on the earlier grant of Exceptional Leave to Remain,
     was to be expected so  as  to  give  effect  to  the  Tribunal's  1995
     decision.  Besides, the grant of Indefinite Leave to  Remain  in  1999
     would also have reflected a view on dangerousness as well (if all  the
     past facts had been  known  to  the  decision-maker,  itself  somewhat
     speculative)  which  could  not   have   allowed   for   the   unknown
     contemporaneous or subsequent offences.

 76. We turn to those other offences for the purposes of considering danger
     to the community.  The  possession  of  the  imitation  firearm  again
     involved an intended visit to someone's house with a view at least  to
     frightening them.  His girlfriend reported him to the  police  because
     she feared that he was going to attack  the  men.   He  explained  all
     these by reference to the  way  Haitians  respond  in  Haiti  to  such
     incidents and to a shortage  of  money.   The  next  firearms  offence
     involved an air pistol purchasable over the counter and  firing  small
     ball bearings.  Again he took it  to  the  house  of  someone  who  he
     thought, perhaps correctly, was racially abusing him and  about  which
     the police had done nothing, and shot the occupant's  dog,  apparently
     without immediate effect, as the dog was being set on him.  Then, with
     his wife a drug addict, he went at the suggestion of  a  friend  to  a
     hotel to steal money and ended up stealing bottles  of  wine  instead.
     Some damage was done.  The  drugs  offence  was  not  proceeded  with,
     although he admitted in the Pre-Sentence Report that he had  seeds  to
     grow cannabis but only so as to save on the cost of purchases.

 77. The second firearms  offence  had  been  committed  while  he  was  on
     licence.  The Pre-Sentence Report in 1999 said  that  based  upon  his
     history there was a significant risk  of  a  similar  offence  in  the
     future;  it appears that that referred to the  firearms  and  not  the
     wounding offence.  (The Secretary of State's letter of 13 October 2000
     accompanying the refusal to revoke the deportation order  misleadingly
     puts his understanding of which offence was being spoken of  into  his
     quote from the report.)  This problem was more likely to  arise  among
     the people he knew than with a stranger.

 78. A  Pre-Sentence  Report  of  2002  in  connection  with  the  burglary
     conviction assessed the risk of future offending as moderate and  said
     that the Appellant was seeking to address his behaviour, changing  his
     lifestyle and settling down, which the Probation officer was minded to
     believe.   The  risk  to  the  public  could  be  dealt   with   under
     supervision.

 79. The psychiatric reports, starting in 2002, do not suggest that he is a
     particular  threat  to  the   community   although   describing   him,
     accurately, as an habitual thief with convictions for assaults.   This
     behaviour was seen as related to his PTSD which had not  been  treated
     for many years.  Treatment and help could reduce the risk of  his  re-
     offending.

 80. We do not consider that the Adjudicator erred in his  assessment  that
     the Appellant constituted a danger to the community.  He has committed
     offences of violence and dishonesty, sometimes in combination, over  a
     number of years, regardless of his prison sentences  and  experiences.
     Some of his burglaries were domestic.  He  has  used  a  firearm,  and
     intended to frighten with another.  He  has  gone  to  other  people's
     houses on a number of occasions in order to deal  with  what  he  says
     were wrongs done to him by frightening them, or  in  circumstances  in
     which violence by him was likely and in  fact  occurred.   We  do  not
     accept that  his  statement  tells  the  complete  truth  about  these
     offences because there is a clear attempt  to  minimise  the  wounding
     offence.  The fact that Indefinite Leave to Remain was granted in 1999
     is not persuasive.  The offences would not  have  warranted  exclusion
     under Article 1F;   it  would  have  been  odd  not  to  have  granted
     Indefinite Leave to Remain eventually in view of the Tribunal decision
     and odder still to have immediately revoked it.  It  was  the  further
     recommendation for deportation which triggered the  present  position.
     The imitation firearms offence was committed the day before the letter
     from the Secretary of State was written granting him Indefinite  Leave
     to Remain.  The  Probation  Officers  in  their  Pre-Sentence  Reports
     recognise that there is a risk of re-offending.  Although this may  be
     reduced by treatment and the Appellant's efforts, the history gives no
     cause  for  optimism.   Rather  it  demonstrates  that  violence   and
     dishonesty are routine constituents of his life and create  continuing
     danger for those who come into contact with him or whose  property  he
     wants.

 81. We do not accept Mr Blake's contention or the Adjudicator's view  that
     a balance must be struck under Article 33(2) between the risk  to  the
     refugee upon refoulement and the danger which his  continued  presence
     poses to the community.  First, Article 33(2) is on its face absolute.
      Chahal considered both its wording and international materials on its
     meaning as well as deportation provisions of the Immigration Rules  in
     coming to its conclusions.  The Immigration Rules supported  the  view
     to which Staughton LJ came at p533D; they were even  more  influential
     in Neill LJ's conclusions at p544F.  With the  exception  of  part  of
     Staughton LJ's reasoning, the two were intertwined.   Yet  it  is  not
     necessary to intertwine them;  the Rules are quite  clear  as  is  the
     appeal provision, section 69(4).  A deportation order will not be made
     and removal  cannot  be  carried  out  where  that  would  breach  the
     Convention.  This  use  of  the  Immigration  Rules  might  have  been
     relevant to the overall decision in Chahal, but it was not relevant to
     the interpretation of Article 33(2).  The Rules  do  not  assist  here
     anyway;  there is no in-country right of appeal against the refusal to
     revoke a deportation order on its merits.  Section  69(4)  permits  an
     appeal  on  the  grounds  that  removal  would  breach   the   Refugee
     Convention, not the Rules.

 82. A closely related issue of balance was  considered  by  the  House  of
     Lords in T v SSHD [1996] AC 742 in relation  to  the  exclusion  of  a
     terrorist under Article 1F, cast in  similarly  absolute  terms.   The
     House held that there was no balance to be struck between the risk  to
     the returning excluded individual who  would  otherwise  have  been  a
     refugee, and the gravity of his exclusionary acts.  The argument as to
     balance, which Mr Blake suggested to their Lordships was even stronger
     than in Chahal and Article 33(2), was given short shrift, but is clear
     enough.  Its conclusion is more implicit than explicit, but it clearly
     accepted  that  T  should  return  to  Algeria,  notwithstanding   the
     contested arguments as to the existence of a balance.

 83. T did not expressly overrule Chahal in the Court of Appeal and it  did
     relate to Article 1F  and  not  Article  33(2).   But  we  regard  its
     conclusion as necessarily leaving little scope for the  Article  33(2)
     balance argument.

 84. The effect of there being no balance in Article 33(2), as we conclude,
     is to emphasise that the tests for "a particularly serious crime"  and
     "danger" must be higher than they would be if there were a balance  to
     be undertaken.  We have allowed for this in our conclusions  on  those
     issues.  It is in particular the "danger"  threshold  which  would  be
     affected  by the risk on return to the refugee, if a balance  were  to
     exist and which we see as quite a high threshold in its absence.

 85. Accordingly, on the view of the law which we take, the changes in  the
     2001 and 2002 Acts are not material, but we refer to them briefly.

 86. Plainly the effect of section 72(2), if applicable, is to  put  beyond
     argument the existence of a particularly serious crime, and  the  fact
     that the crime for which a sentence of three years was passed preceded
     the Act does not affect the application of the Act to it.  This  would
     otherwise introduce a wide and arbitrary degree  of  variability  into
     the application of the provision.  No language  in  the  Act  supports
     such an outcome.  On the views which we have expressed the presumption
     as to the danger to the community has not been rebutted.   It  follows
     that the debate about the coming into force of section  72(2)  of  the
     2002 Act has no bearing on the decision  as  to  the  existence  of  a
     particularly serious crime or danger to the community.

 87. Were we to have reached a different view of the law and facts, so that
     section 72 if applicable,  made  a  difference  to  the  outcome,  its
     possible retrospective application here would have to  be  considered.
     Section 72(1) must be read as saying that section 72 applies, from the
     coming into  force  of  the  section  on  10  February  2003,  to  the
     construction and application of the Convention.  It does  not  purport
     to have retrospective effect in the way illustrated by section  67  in
     Khadir.  So the question is whether that can apply to an appeal to the
     Tribunal from an Adjudicator's  determination  to  which  it  did  not
     apply.  As we have said, the appeal continues under the  1999  Act  by
     virtue of the transitional provisions of Commencement Order No 4.

 88. If the specific definition of  "a  particularly  serious  offence"  in
     section 72(2) includes offences which would not  otherwise  have  been
     within the scope of Article 33(2), section 72(2)  alters  the  law  to
     that  extent  but  in  its  effect  is  qualified  by  the  rebuttable
     presumption as to dangerousness in  subsection  (6).   Except  to  the
     extent that  that  alters  the  burden  of  proof,  the  dangerousness
     requirement would have to be satisfied conformably with the Convention
     thresholds.  This ought to lead to the same result as  before,  except
     where the change in the burden of proof, if  it  is  a  change,  would
     affect the outcome.

 89. This provision does not have many of  the  objectionable  features  of
     retrospective changes to the law.  It does not change the character of
     past transactions or  arrangements;   nor  does  it  criminalise  past
     conduct or increase  the  criminal  penalties.   But  it  changes  the
     potential asylum consequences of a past criminal act and its sentence;
      it may affect a decision as to whether  an  appeal  against  sentence
     should be launched.  Whether this is characterised as a  retrospective
     change to the  law  or  not  (because  it  affects  the  prospects  of
     removal), we would not regard it as right to apply it so as to  enable
     an Adjudicator's decision to  be  appealed  to  the  Tribunal  on  the
     grounds that the effect of the intervening statutory provision was  to
     give one side an  argument,  potentially  a  winning  argument,  which
     previously he had lacked, after what could have been a final  judicial
     determination.  We would have expected clear words to show  that  that
     effect was intended.  We do not consider that the new definition of "a
     particularly serious crime" can be regarded as a  mere  clarification.
     Its scope is capable of including some crimes  which  would  not  have
     previously been covered.

 90. This is reinforced by the language of the Tribunal's powers on  appeal
     in paragraph 22(2) of Schedule  4  to  the  1999  Act  which,  if  not
     affirming the Adjudicator's determination, enables it  only  "to  make
     any other determination which the Adjudicator could have made".

 91. Accordingly, we would not have applied  those  provisions  if  we  had
     reached a different view about  the  seriousness  of  the  Appellant's
     crimes or his continuing danger.  The  provision  applies  to  appeals
     brought under the 2002 Act, whether  to  the  Adjudicator  or  to  the
     Tribunal.

 92. We turn to those statutory provisions which deal with the question  of
     balance.  It follows from what we have said  that  we  do  not  regard
     section 72(8) or section 34 as changing the substantive law or the way
     in which the United Kingdom applies the Refugee  Convention.   Section
     34 is the key provision on the absence of a balancing exercise.

 93. Although section 34 falls  within  Part  4  of  the  2001  Act  headed
     "Immigration and Asylum", it is not in  the  group  of  sections  sub-
     headed "Suspected International Terrorists"  but  in  the  group  sub-
     headed "Refugee Convention".   There  is  little  value  in  the  sub-
     headings as an interpretative aid and the section is  not  limited  to
     certification of suspected international terrorists or SIAC cases.  We
     can see no justification for limiting the scope of that  provision  to
     terrorist crimes, which are  usually  ordinary  crimes  committed  for
     political motives, and excluding from it ordinary crimes.  If  various
     distinctions of that sort had been intended, the drafting  would  have
     had to have been rather more specific.  Section  72  does  not  simply
     apply section 34 to a  wider  group  of  asylum  cases.   Neither  the
     wording of section 72 nor of section 34 is apt for that.   The  latter
     is formulated generally so as to deal with balance.

 94. Section 72(8) is less directly important here.  It removes  the  issue
     of risk on return from consideration of whether someone is a danger to
     the community under subsection (6).  It may be difficult  to  see  how
     the consideration of the risk to the individual  on  return  would  be
     relevant to the degree of risk which he posed to the community  if  he
     stayed, and therefore difficult to see  what  more  it  is  that  this
     provision achieves which was not already covered by section  34.   The
     later part of section 72(8) starting "as it applies ..." suggests that
     it is introducing the removal of a possible obligation in relation  to
     subsection (6), which has already been  removed  in  relation  to  the
     Refugee Convention by section 34.  It  seems  that  the  provision  is
     simply designed to make matters clear in relation to the new statutory
     presumption in section 72(6) and  to  avoid  argument  that  this  had
     negated the effect of section 34 when the new statutory  provision  in
     section 72(6) was being applied.  It thus aimed for consistency.

 95. Even if we had accepted Mr Blake's submissions as to the relevance  of
     balance within Article 33(2), in  the  absence  of  other  legislative
     provision, we would have applied section 34 to this case.  First,  the
     position is far from clear at its most  favourable  to  Mr  Blake  and
     section 34 can legitimately be seen as clarifying the  law  along  the
     lines in part unsuccessfully contended for by the Secretary  of  State
     in Chahal and successfully argued in T.  It is not necessary to  reach
     a view that Mr Blake was right and then to  treat  section  34  as  an
     alteration.  Second, this legislation deals  with  how,  prospectively
     for removal, danger is to be compared with risk or rather  not  to  be
     compared.  It does not involve changing any characterisation or effect
     of a past completed act, or giving a new effect  to  it.   Third,  the
     change came into effect here before any judicial determination of  the
     appeal  and  does  not  involve  the  removal  of  what   might   have
     successfully been achieved before the Adjudicator.

 96. However, for the reasons which we have given, the Appellant  does  not
     have the protection of Article 33(2) anyway.

 97. Accordingly, we consider that  the  Appellant  is  excluded  from  the
     operation of Article 33(1).  His return to Haiti would not  involve  a
     breach of the Refugee Convention.

 98. We turn finally to the ECHR.  We regard the views of  the  Adjudicator
     in relation to the availability of medical treatment in Haiti even  in
     the circumstances which he was considering as markedly optimistic, but
     we do not need to consider whether or not we are impelled to  disagree
     with them on the basis upon which he reached his conclusions,  because
     we approach the application of Article 3 on a rather different factual
     basis.  Having concluded that there is a real risk that the  Appellant
     would be persecuted were he to be returned, there is no need  for  any
     further separate consideration  of  Article  3.   The  return  of  the
     Appellant would breach this provision for the reasons  which  we  have
     set out, including detention in the prison conditions we should assume
     to prevail and the effect  which  that  would  have  upon  his  mental
     health.  On that basis, he will not be removed.  It is  not  necessary
     for us to consider Article 8 and mental health separately from Article
     3.  The issues as to proportionality do not arise.  We do not disagree
     with the Adjudicator's conclusions  in  relation  to  the  Appellant's
     family life.

 99. Therefore, we allow the appeal in part  in  relation  to  the  Refugee
     Convention but on different grounds from  those  which  persuaded  the
     Adjudicator.  We allow  the  appeal  on  human  rights  grounds.   The
     effect, however, is that the Appellant remains a refugee,  who  cannot
     be returned, even though to do so  would  not  breach  Article  33(2).
     Article 33(2) is not by itself a cessation or exclusion provision;  it
     only deals with removal.

100. This decision  is  reported  for  what  we  say  about  cessation  and
     refoulement, and about Haiti.
