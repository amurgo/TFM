For the Appellant:     Mr A Stone, Counsel instructed by Martyns Rose
                  Solicitors
For the Respondent:  Mr G. Harrison, Specialist Appeals Team

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant appeals to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal (Judge Tipping sitting at Taylor House  on  20  May
    2014) dismissing her appeal against the decision by  the  Secretary  of
    State to refuse to grant her ILR on the grounds of long residence.





The Grant of Permission to Appeal

 2. On 23 June 2014 First-tier Tribunal Judge Reid  granted  permission  to
    appeal on the ground that it was arguable that the judge had materially
    erred in law by failing to consider fully the documentary  evidence  in
    calculating the appellant's time in the UK.

The Rule 24 Response

 3. Mr Pal of the Specialist Appeals Team opposed the appeal, arguing  that
    the FTT judge had directed himself appropriately. It was open to him to
    find that the appellant had not demonstrated that she had been  in  the
    UK before early 1999.

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

 4. At the hearing before  me,  Mr  Harrison  conceded  that  the  Rule  24
    Response did not address the criticism that  the  judge  had  erred  in
    failing to make a finding on when the "clock stopped".

Reasons for finding an Error of Law

 5. The appellant made her application for  ILR  on  the  grounds  of  long
    residence on 6 July 2012, so her application was governed by the  "old"
    rule (paragraph 276B) and not by the new twenty year rule.

 6. The appellant's case was that she had arrived in the UK on 16 June 1997
    and had lived here continuously ever since. Judge  Tipping  found  that
    she had not proved that she had arrived in the UK before early 1999.

 7. The first ground of appeal to the UT is that the judge thereby  ignored
    the evidence of Dr Lloyd, who operates as a GP in Oxford  and  who  had
    signed a letter saying that the appellant had been  a  patient  of  his
    since January 1998. But the judge was not obliged  to  refer  to  every
    piece of evidence that was  before  him,  and  he  reasonably  attached
    greater weight to primary documents such as bank statements than to the
    written testimony of witnesses whose evidence had not  been  tested  in
    cross-examination. Moreover, as noted in the refusal letter,  Dr  Lloyd
    had not provided consistent evidence. In a separate letter, also in the
    respondent's bundle, he  only  affirmed  the  appellant's  presence  in
    Oxford in  1999.   It  is  recorded  in  paragraph  9  of  the  judge's
    determination that Mr Haque on behalf of the  appellant  accepted  that
    she had not registered with a GP in Oxford until March  2000.  This  is
    the date which appears on her medical card  (see  paragraph  8  of  the
    determination). Accordingly, it was clearly open to the  judge  not  to
    treat as reliable Dr Lloyd's assertion that he had known the  appellant
    as a patient since January 1998.

 8. The second ground of appeal has much greater merit, and the  respondent
    has no answer to it. The judge erroneously  proceeded  on  the  premise
    that the appellant needed to show fourteen years  continuous  residence
    going back from the date of her application  on  6  July  2012.  So  he
    dismissed her appeal on the ground that she had not shown  she  was  in
    the country by 6 July 1998. Under the new twenty year rule,  the  clock
    is stopped at the date of application. But under the old fourteen  year
    rule, the clock is only  stopped  following  service  of  a  notice  of
    liability to removal or a notice  of  decision  to  remove  by  way  of
    directions. So in the appellant's case, the clock was not stopped until
    10 July 2013 when she was served with an ISI5A notice. By that time, on
    the judge's finding, she had accrued over  fourteen  years'  continuous
    unlawful residence.

 9. The third ground of appeal is that the judge's finding on Article 8 was
    erroneous in that he gave inadequate weight to the  family  life  which
    the appellant had established (as an illegal entrant or overstayer).  I
    consider that the judge has given adequate and sustainable reasons  for
    dismissing the alternative claim under Article 8, and his  decision  on
    that issue discloses no discrete error of law. But his decision on  the
    applicability of the old long residence rule is vitiated by a  material
    error of law such that it should be set aside and remade.

The Remaking of the Decision

10. The only issue  raised  in  the  refusal  letter  with  regard  to  the
    appellant's eligibility for ILR under paragraph 276B was that  she  had
    not proved fourteen years' continuous  residence.  The  respondent  was
    only prepared to accept that she had been in the UK since 2012.

11. Mr Harrison does not invite me to revisit the judge's finding that  the
    appellant arrived in early 1999, as evidenced by a provisional  driving
    licence that was issued to her on 1 April 1999.

12. Accordingly, the appellant has discharged the burden  of  proving  that
    she qualifies for ILR under paragraph 276B of the rules.

Conclusion

13. The decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  dismissing  the  appellant's
    appeal on Article 8 grounds did not contain an error of law, and so the
    decision stands. But the decision of the First-tier Tribunal dismissing
    the appeal under the rules contained  an  error  of  law,  and  so  the
    following decision is substituted: the appellant's appeal  against  the
    decision to refuse to grant her ILR on the grounds of long residence is
    allowed under paragraph 276B of the rules.

Anonymity

14. The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i)
    of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.


Signed                              Date

Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Monson


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision  to  re-make  the  decision  in  the  appeal  by
allowing it, I have considered  whether  to  make  a  fee  award  (rule  23A
(costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure)  Rules  2005  and
section 12(4)(a) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007).


I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).


I make a reduced fee award of ï¿½70.


Reasons:      The appellant was ultimately successful  on  her  claim  under
the rules, but she was not successful on her Article 8 claim.
