Representation:

For the appellant:     Mr S Iketubosin, instructed by Leslie Charles
Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr A McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants, Talent Gold Gabriel-Oluwatobi, date of  birth  24.4.77,
    and her  daughter,  Favour  Eniola  Gabriel-Oluwatobi,  date  of  birth
    4.1.04, are citizens of Nigeria.

 2. This are their appeals against the determination of First-tier Tribunal
    Judge  Pacey  promulgated  13.6.14,  dismissing  their  linked  appeals
    against the decisions of the respondent to  refuse  their  applications
    made on 4.10.13 for leave to remain in the UK on the basis  of  private
    and family life and to remove them from the UK pursuant to  section  47
    of the Immigration Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.   The  Judge  heard
    the appeal on 2.6.14.

 3. First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Froom  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    25.7.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 18.11.14 as an appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Pacey should be set aside.

 6. The relevant background to the appeal can be summarised as follows. The
    first appellant came to the UK as the dependant of a Tier  4  (General)
    Student in March 2011, with her children. Their leave was  subsequently
    extended to 7.12.13. The first appellant  gave  birth  to  a  child  in
    relation to which her husband  was  not  the  father,  leading  to  the
    breakdown of the relationship. She applied for leave to remain  as  the
    carer for her youngest son, Franklin,  a  British  citizen.  The  other
    children were Nigerian nationals and it was asserted  that  they  could
    not be expected to return to Nigeria without their  mother  or  British
    half-sibling, reliance being placed  on  section  55  of  the  Borders,
    Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009, as well as on human rights.

 7. On 7.3.14 it had been decided that there was no valid  appeal  for  the
    first appellant's son Fortune and thus his  case  was  not  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal.  The  appeal  had  been  adjourned  to  allow  the
    Secretary of State to consider making a removal  decision  for  Fortune
    and to confirm whether Franklin was a British citizen. However, neither
    issue had been resolved by the date of the First-tier  Tribunal  appeal
    hearing before Judge Pacey, who proceeded on the basis that Franklin is
    a British citizen, his  birth  certificate  and  passport  having  been
    produced.

 8. In  summary,  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  found  that  the  rules
    applicable in article 8 cases were not met. In  particular,  she  found
    the  first  appellant  had  not   established   that   she   had   sole
    responsibility for her youngest  child,  Franklin,  who  is  a  British
    citizen. She did not believe that his  father  had  lost  contact.  She
    found Franklin could live with his mother in Nigeria, which was in  his
    best interests. She found no exceptional or compelling circumstances to
    justify a grant of leave outside the Rules and, in any event, found the
    removal decision proportionate to the appellants' article 8 rights.

 9. The grounds of application for permission to appeal take issue with the
    judge's findings on sole  responsibility.  In  granting  permission  to
    appeal, Judge Froom found little merit  in  those  grounds  because  it
    appears the judge considered the evidence and made a finding  which  it
    was open to her to make. "However, I grant permission to appeal because
    it is arguable the judge failed to grapple  with  the  Zambrano  issue,
    which was raised in the grounds of appeal. On the face of it, absent  a
    finding that Franklin could live with his father,  removing  the  first
    appellant would compel Franklin to leave as well, with the result  that
    his freedom to reside in the EU would be jeopardised."

10. The Rule 24 response, dated 7.8.14, submits that whilst the  judge  did
    not mention the 'Zambrano issue' in her  determination,  "it  is  clear
    from the content that she is not satisfied that the main appellant  has
    sole responsibility for the British  citizen  child  and  as  such  the
    child's father was in  contact.  It  is  accepted  that  no  definitive
    findings were made on the Zambrano issue, but it will be submitted that
    given the findings the appellant's appeal cannot succeed."

11. In Gerado Ruiz Zambrano v Office national de l'emploi  [2011]  AER  (D)
    199, the refusal of residence to the two Colombian parents  meant  that
    their minor dependent children, who were Union citizens, would have  to
    leave the territory of the Union in order to  accompany  their  parents
    (not  just  the  territory  of  the  country  in  question).  In  those
    circumstances, those Union citizens would be  unable  to  exercise  the
    substance of the rights conferred on them by virtue of their status  as
    Union citizens.

12. In DH (Jamaica) and others v SSHD [2012] EWCA Civ  1736  the  Court  of
    Appeal said that the application of the Zambrano test required a  focus
    on whether, as a matter of reality, the EU citizen would be obliged  to
    give up residence in the EU if the non-EU national was removed. If  the
    EU citizen, be it wife or child, would not in practice be compelled  to
    leave the country if the non-EU family member were to  be  refused  the
    right of residence, there was nothing in the jurisprudence  to  suggest
    that EU law would be engaged simply because their continuing  residence
    was in some sense affected, for example, in relation to the quality  of
    life. The right of residence was a right to reside in the territory not
    a right to any particular quality of life  or  particular  standard  of
    living and only if that was affected to such  an  extent  that  it  was
    likely to compel the EU citizen to leave would the principle apply.

13. In Sanade and others (British children - Zambrano - Dereci) [2012] UKUT
    00048 (IAC) the Tribunal held that where in the context  of  Article  8
    one parent ("the remaining parent") of a British citizen child is  also
    a British citizen (or cannot be removed as a family member or in  their
    own right), the removal of the other parent does not mean  that  either
    the child or the remaining parent will be required  to  leave,  thereby
    infringing the Zambrano principle. The critical question is whether the
    child is dependent on the parent being removed for the exercise of  his
    Union right of residence  and  whether  removal  of  that  parent  will
    deprive the child of the effective exercise of residence in the  United
    Kingdom or elsewhere in the Union.

14. It follows that the issue of sole responsibility was at  the  heart  of
    the appeal before the First-tier Tribunal,  both  in  relation  to  the
    Immigration Rules and the Zambrano principle. Under section E-LTRPT  of
    Appendix FM, in order to qualify for leave to remain as the parent of a
    child, all the requirements of E-LTRPT 2.2 to 5.2 must be met.  On  the
    circumstances of this case, E-LTRPT 2.3(a) requires the first appellant
    to have sole responsibility for the child and E-LTRPT 2.4 requires  her
    to provide evidence that she has sole responsibility.

15. Franklin is entitled to live and enjoy the rights of a British citizen.
    The Zambrano principle would be infringed if the removal of his mother,
    the first appellant, means that Franklin will be required to leave.

16. In relation to sole responsibility the judge rejected the  evidence  of
    the first appellant that Franklin's father had disappeared and did  not
    have contact with him and no means of doing so  and  concluded  at  �17
    that she did not have sole responsibility for the child. As  did  Judge
    Froom, I also find that  conclusion  was  open  to  the  judge  on  the
    evidence  and  for  which  she  has  given  cogent   reasons   in   the
    determination. It thus follows  that  the  first  appellant  could  not
    succeed under Appendix FM.

17. The judge went on to find, for good reason, that  the  first  appellant
    cannot succeed under paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration Rules.  Whilst
    it was not directly considered in the determination an  application  of
    276ADE to the second appellant who had lived in the UK since 2011 could
    not have succeeded.

18. In relation to human rights, it is clear that from �20  the  judge  was
    considering the proportionality of the decision balancing  on  the  one
    hand the legitimate and necessary aim  of  the  state  to  protect  the
    economic well-being of the UK through immigration control, and  on  the
    other the private and family life rights of the appellants, as well  as
    that of Franklin and Fortune. At �22 the judge  specifically  addressed
    the best interests of Franklin as a British citizen.

19. I do not accept the submissions in  the  grounds  of  appeal  that  the
    conclusion that it would not be  unreasonable  to  expect  Franklin  to
    accompany his mother to Nigeria is inconsistent or  at  odds  with  the
    earlier finding that she does not have  sole  responsibility  for  that
    child. The judge was considering different issues and the fact that  it
    would be reasonable to expect the child to accompany  her  to  Nigeria,
    does not mean that he is obliged to leave the UK. The question at  this
    stage was the  proportionality  of  the  decision  to  remove  the  two
    appellants. That does not mean that  it  can  never  be  reasonable  to
    expect a British citizen child to accompany his mother and siblings  to
    Nigeria.

20. The British citizenship of the child is not a trump card for the mother
    to play. If she does not have sole  responsibility  for  Franklin,  and
    there is contact with the father, it  implies  that  there  is  another
    person, his father, available to care for him in the UK,  so  that  the
    Zambrano principle is not infringed. Whether the child accompanies  her
    or stays with his natural  father  is  a  matter  for  the  parents  to
    resolve, but  the  judge  gave  good  reasons  for  concluding  in  the
    proportionality assessment that it would not be unreasonable to  expect
    the appellants to return, together with the other children, to Nigeria.
    In reaching that conclusion the judge took into  account  and  grappled
    with the competing interests, including the best interests of the child
    under section 55, and his rights as a British citizen, but  noting  the
    young  age  and  obvious  lack  of  integration  in  the  UK.  In   the
    circumstances, the decision of the judge was one open to  her  and  for
    which cogent reasons have been given.

21. I note in passing that it  may  be  that  the  first  appellant  has  a
    derivative right of residence under the Immigration  (EEA)  Regulations
    2006, but that was not part of her application and not  raised  in  any
    grounds of appeal.



Conclusions:

22. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                  The decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  stands  and  the
                  appeal of each appellant remains dismissed.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed and thus there can be no fee award.
