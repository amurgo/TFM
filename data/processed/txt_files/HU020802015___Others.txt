Representation:

For the Appellants:    Ms S Nnamani, Counsel, instructed by Howe & Co
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms A Everett, Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellants are citizens of Nepal and are siblings.   In  July  2015
    the Entry  Clearance  Officer  refused  their  applications  for  entry
    clearance as the dependent adult children of a veteran of  the  Brigade
    of Ghurkas of the British Army.  Their  appeals  were  heard  by  Judge
    Andonian of the  First-tier  Tribunal  (FtT).   On  16  March  2017  he
    promulgated a decision dismissing all  appeals.   The  appellants  were
    granted leave to appeal the judge's decision.  In a decision sent on  8
    January 2018 I set aside the FtT's decision for material error of  law.
    I directed that there  be  a  further  hearing  at  which  the  sponsor
    attended  as  a  witness  to  explain  and   document   his   financial
    circumstances both at the time of leaving Nepal to come to  the  UK  in
    April 2012 to settle, and subsequently.

2.   At the resumed hearing I heard evidence from  the  sponsor,  Mr  Deoman
    Limbu, aged 71, and three of his friends,  Mr  Man  Bahadur  Limbu,  Mr
    Rajendra Bahadur Limbu and Mr Meherman Limbu, each  of  whom  had  been
    soldiers who served with Mr Deoman Limbu and each of whom had  provided
    a supplementary witness statement.  The thrust  of  Mr  Deoman  Limbu's
    evidence was that despite  two  of  his  children  obtaining  Bachelors
    degrees, all five were still without jobs  and  remained  dependent  on
    him.  He and his wife's income from pension benefits was  approximately
    �1,300 a month, approximately �350-�400 a month of which  goes  on  his
    children.  A friend, Biswo Kumar Limbu, had lent him money  to  make  a
    settlement application  when  he  was  in  Nepal.   Altogether  he  had
    borrowed approximately �4,000  to  travel  and  settle  in  the  United
    Kingdom.  He speaks to his children every day on the phone.   His  wife
    suffers from a hearing impairment.  He and his wife have been  back  to
    Nepal to visit their children three times - in  2014,  2015  and  2017.
    The evidence of his three friends was broadly consistent with his.

3.   There was one area of evidence on which there was a  considerable  lack
    of clarity.  In his witness statement Mr Deoman Limbu  stated  that  as
    well as sending money by  way  of  remittance  he  sent  money  through
    friends by hand, mostly because it is cheaper and easier.  In his  oral
    testimony, however, he said he never sent money through  friends.   His
    witnesses said they had taken money and gifts to the sponsor's children
    when they had visited.  Ms Everett in her closing submissions  did  not
    seek to make much of this discrepancy and in my judgment she was  right
    not to do so.  It was apparent to me that the sponsor and his witnesses
    struggled to recollect precise details, the sponsor in particular,  and
    that the most likely explanation for the apparent  discrepancy  lay  in
    the fact that when visiting his children his friends saw the money they
    gave as being gifts from them and that within the network of  ex-Gurkha
    soldiers there was a culture of helping each other financially  and  no
    clear dividing line always between lending  and  giving.   Despite  the
    discrepancies between the sponsor's written and  oral  evidence,  I  am
    satisfied on balance that (i) he did borrow approximately  �4,000  from
    friends in order to settle in the UK with his wife;  (ii)  he  and  his
    wife live a very frugal life; and (iii) they have been supporting their
    children at the rate of approximately �350-400 a month since they  came
    to the UK for settlement.  A variable element of the money the  sponsor
    provides for the support of his children is comprised of gifts or loans
    from his friends.

4.   Ms Nnamani submitted that the  remaining  issue  in  this  case  was  a
    narrow one - whether there was an  existing  family  life  between  the
    sponsor and the appellants within the  meaning  of  Article  8(1):  She
    submitted that the evidence demonstrated that there was, in that  there
    was clear financial dependency and ongoing  emotional  dependency.   Ms
    Everett said that notwithstanding the evidence regarding how monies are
    sent to the sponsor's children, she accepted that monies were going  to
    them.   The  evidence  was  not  entirely  clear  as  to  the   precise
    accommodation circumstances of the appellants in Nepal but it  appeared
    that the family had a small plot of  land.   As  to  why  none  of  the
    appellants had married, the evidence was mixed, the sponsor saying that
    none of them wanted to marry.  The cases of  the  appellants  were  not
    clearly distinguished from one another and overall their  circumstances
    were insufficiently evidenced.

My assessment

5.   I observe first of all that this case involves five  appellants.   That
    should always have been clear from the fact that all five  applied  for
    entry clearance and each received an individual refusal.  However,  for
    some reason the appeal forms for each of them only put the name of  one
    of them - Gurudev.  Despite this  procedural  failing  it  is  entirely
    clear that appeals were intended to be lodged by all five and that  was
    how the FtT judge approached the matter.

6.   Both parties agree that the remaining  issue  in  these  appeals  is  a
    narrow one - whether there exists family life between the  sponsor  and
    his wife and the five appellants within the meaning  of  Article  8(1).
    The respondent accepts that the appellants have  suffered  an  historic
    injustice.

7.   Ms  Everett  submitted  at  one  point  that  the  cases  of  the  five
    appellants  were  not  sufficiently  distinguished  from  each   other.
    However, I concur with Ms Nnamani that their  joint  witness  statement
    dated 14 February 2017,  whose  prime  author  is  Bhupendra,  contains
    specific  details  regarding  the  situation  of  each  of  them.  This
    statement sets out that Bhupendra and Gurudev had left their studies to
    help in the fields.  Hemant Kumar, Parbati and Rabindra Kumar continued
    their study until 2006 under Gurkha welfare support.  Bhupendra was now
    taking  a  graphics  design  course.   Hemant  is  currently  studying.
    Parbati is pursuing a Bachelor degree in Business Studies, Rabindra  is
    still in high school.

8.   As regards financial dependency, I am  satisfied  that  this  has  been
    established in the appellants' case.  There are two  aspects  to  this.
    First, as Ms Everett accepts, the sponsor has clearly  been  supporting
    the appellants by a combination of remittances and monies (in the  form
    of gifts or otherwise) paid in person to them by friends of the sponsor
    when they visit.  The remittance receipts submitted by the sponsor show
    payments being made over various dates from November 2013  to  February
    2018, which satisfies me that the financial dependency is ongoing.  The
    other aspect concerns the economic circumstances of the  appellants  in
    Nepal.  Ms Everett is right that the evidence is incomplete, but it  is
    nevertheless  sufficient  to  satisfy  me   (i)   that   their   living
    circumstances are rudimentary; and (ii) none have  obtained  jobs.   In
    addition to the unemployed status verification  letters,  none  of  the
    appellants' witnesses who had visited the appellants described them  as
    having employment.

9.   As regards emotional dependency, the FtT judge found that  the  sponsor
    and his wife know little about the lives being led by  the  appellants.
    However, this finding depended heavily on the judge's assessment of the
    wife of the sponsor who  in  cross-examination  was  unable  to  answer
    simple questions put to her about where the children  live,  what  they
    are doing.  However, as Ms Everett acknowledged, there was unchallenged
    evidence that the  wife  had  a  hearing  impairment.   There  is  also
    considerable documentary evidence showing calls being made  on  a  near
    daily basis from the sponsor's telephone to the telephone of Bhupendra.



10.  Having heard from the sponsor and his witnesses and  taken  account  of
    the evidence as a whole, I consider that both the sponsor and his  wife
    in this case are elderly people who  do  not  have  a  close  group  of
    particulars.  In the case of witnesses less affected by  infirmities  I
    would have concerns that their vagueness  was  indicative  of  evidence
    that was not credible.  In their case,  however,  I  consider  it  more
    likely than not that they do in fact have almost daily contact by phone
    with one or more of the appellants  and  that  they  have  in  addition
    visited their children in 2014, 2015 and 2017 staying several weeks  on
    each occasion. They  may  not  be  good  at  expressing  in  a  hearing
    environment what they know about each of  their  children,  but  it  is
    sufficiently  clear  that  they  retain  close  emotional   connection,
    significantly over and above those normally to be found between parents
    and adult dependants of their ages.

11.  Despite their vagueness,  I  am  satisfied  that  the  couple  maintain
    strong family ties with their children and  continue  to  see  them  as
    their dependants in both financial and emotional respects.

12.  I am also satisfied from the appellants' witness  statements,  together
    with the other evidence, that they remain close to  their  parents  and
    sorely miss their parents' absence.  They are all single and unmarried.
     Their life experiences as described indicate that the sponsor  remains
    the main patriarchal figure in their lives and  will  remain  so  until
    they are married.  That remains the  case,  notwithstanding  that  they
    have no health problems and appear well able to look after  themselves,
    to cook, clean and do their own laundry.

13.  Ms Everett submitted that I should consider their failure to  marry  as
    a matter of choice.  The evidence on this matter is not  clear-cut  but
    it seems to me that given their weak  economic  circumstances  marriage
    would not be a priority for any of them.  I am satisfied that they have
    not established independent lives  and  that  they  have  not  done  so
    primarily for  economic  reasons.   The  evidence  as  to  whether  the
    appellants continue to live together is mixed, but whether they are  or
    not, I am satisfied  that  each  remains  financially  and  emotionally
    dependent on the sponsor.

14.  For the FtT judge one of  the  reasons  he  dismissed  the  appellants'
    appeal was that "[t]he appellants  have  been  living  apart  from  the
    sponsors as a direct result of the parents migrating to the  UK  rather
    than because of the siblings being away from the family unit because of
    educational circumstances" and "[t]he evidence suggested to me that the
    parents were content to leave for the UK  without  the  appellants  and
    without making obvious care  arrangements"  and  "I  believe  that  the
    decision was made by the parents that as adults  their  children  could
    care for themselves".  These findings have to be read in the context of
    the accumulated learning on  Gurkha  dependent  cases  elaborated  most
    recently by the Court of Appeal in Rai v ECO (New  Delhi)  [2017]  EWCA
    Civ 320.  It is clear from that decision that significant weight had to
    be given to the fact that the appellants "would  have  applied  at  the
    same time for leave to enter the UK and  would  have  come  to  the  UK
    together as a family unit had they been able to afford to do so".   The
    evidence in this case clearly demonstrates that the sponsor would  have
    applied for the appellants to settle in the UK at the same time as  him
    and his wife had they been able to afford to do  so.   They  could  not
    afford to and indeed had to borrow money to be able to go themselves.

15.  The case of Rai also makes clear that whether or not  the  parents  had
    chosen to leave Nepal to settle in the UK when they did,  the  critical
    question under Article 8(1) is whether family life subsisted  then  and
    whether it is still  subsisting.   For  reasons  given  earlier,  I  am
    satisfied that family life between the sponsor, his wife and  the  five
    appellants was subsisting in 2012 and continues to subsist now.

Notice of Decision

16.  For the above reasons I consider that the Article 8(1)  issue  must  be
    decided in favour of the appellants.  It is not in dispute that if they
    establish family life then the decision was not  a  proportionate  one.
    Accordingly, I re-make the decision by allowing on  Article  8  grounds
    their appeals against the ECO refusals of entry clearance.

17.  No anonymity direction is made.


Signed:                                 Date: 25 April 2018.
