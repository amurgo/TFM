Representation:

For the Appellant:     No appearance
For the Respondent:    Mr S. Kandola, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


Anonymity
Rule 14: The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008
No anonymity order was made by the First-tier  Tribunal.  We  find  that  no
particular issues arise on the facts of this case that  might  infringe  the
appellant's protected human rights if  the  details  were  to  become  known
publicly. For this reason no anonymity direction is made.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background

1.    The appellant is a citizen of Iraq whose date  of  birth  is  15  June
    1991. He appealed against the respondent's decision dated 19 July  2010
    to refuse to vary and extend his leave to remain in the UK and to grant
    asylum and to remove him by way of a direction made under section 47 of
    the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006 ("IANA 2006").

2.    The appeal was dismissed by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Archer  in  a
    decision promulgated on 13 October 2010.  The appellant did not seek to
    challenge the decision until an application for  permission  to  appeal
    (and to extend time) was lodged on 22 May 2015. The grounds  of  appeal
    did not seek to challenge the substantive findings made by  the  First-
    tier Judge in relation to the protection claim but alleged  that  there
    was an error of law relating to the  section  47  removal  decision  in
    light of the line of authorities in Patel v SSHD [2012] EWCA  Civ  741,
    Adamally  and  Jaferi   (section   47   removal   decisions:   Tribunal
    Procedures)[2012] UKUT 00414 and Ahmadi v SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ 512.

3.    Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Shimmin
    on the ground that it was arguable that there was a material  error  of
    law in relation to the section 47 removal decision. The judge  accepted
    that there were special circumstances  which  make  it  unjust  not  to
    extend time.

Conclusions

4.    There was no appearance by or  on  behalf  of  the  appellant  at  the
    hearing. We were satisfied that he and his legal  representatives  were
    served with the notice of hearing to the last known addresses given  on
    the application for permission to appeal. No explanation was given  for
    his failure to attend. We were  satisfied  that  we  could  proceed  to
    decide the appeal in the absence of the appellant.

5.    On behalf of the Secretary of  State  Mr  Kandola  accepted  that  the
    section 47 decision was one that was made prior to  the  amendments  to
    the IANA 2006 on 08 May 2013.  He  acknowledged  that  there  had  been
    standing instructions to Home Office Presenting  Officers  to  withdraw
    such decisions. As such he was  content  to  withdraw  the  section  47
    removal decision at the hearing. The  Tribunal  gave  consent  to  this
    course of action and accordingly treated the  section  47  decision  as
    withdrawn under rule 17 of  The  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)
    Rules 2008.

6.    The appellant did not seek to challenge the  substantive  findings  of
    the First-tier Tribunal,  which  dismissed  his  appeal  on  protection
    grounds. That part of the decision stands. Permission  was  granted  on
    the sole ground that there may be an arguable error of law in  relation
    to the removal decision. As a result of the section 47  decision  being
    withdrawn we find that there is no longer a  valid  appeal  before  the
    Tribunal.

DECISION

There is no valid appeal before the Tribunal
