Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms Akhter, counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr Avery, Home Office Presenting Officer



                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This matter comes before me for consideration  as  to  whether  or  not
    there is a material error of law in  the  determination  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Beg ("the FTTJ") promulgated  on  23  October  2015,  in
    which she refused the appellant's appeal against  the  refusal  of  her
    application for entry clearance to settle in the UK as a partner  under
    Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.


 2. No anonymity direction was made in the First-tier Tribunal  but,  given
    my references to  the  personal  circumstances  of  the  appellant  and
    sponsor an anonymity order is now appropriate.

Background

 3. The appellant is a Bangladeshi citizen who sought  entry  clearance  to
    join her husband in the UK. This was refused because the appellant  had
    not provided her original marriage certificate and  the  appellant  had
    not complied with the evidential  requirements  of  Appendix  FM-SE  to
    demonstrate her husband met the income threshold.


 4. The FTTJ found, on appeal, that the  appellant's  marriage  certificate
    was being held by the British High Commission at the date  of  decision
    (albeit not by the  respondent);  the  specified  documentary  evidence
    relating to the  sponsor's  earnings  had  not  been  provided  to  the
    respondent; there was no unfairness in the respondent's not  requesting
    missing documents and that any interference with the appellant's family
    and private life was proportionate under Article 8.

 5. Permission to appeal was sought and granted in the following terms:


         "...Having had sight of the Judge's Record  of  Proceedings  it  is
         clear that the Appellant [sic] gave oral evidence and  it  is  thus
         not arguable that the Appellant did not have a fair hearing.


         4. However, it is arguable that the Judge erred in  dismissing  the
         appeal on a basis not raised in  the  refusal  without  asking  the
         Sponsor for an explanation or  submissions.   It  is  also  unclear
         whether the Judge found the bank  statement,  referred  to  in  the
         Refusal to have been before the Entry Clearance Officer or not  and
         if not it was arguably one (the latest) in a series that  had  been
         supplied such that  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  ought  to  have
         requested it."

 6. Hence the matter comes before me.

Submissions

 7. Ms Akhter accepted, for the appellant, that the missing bank  statement
    showing the sponsor's receipt of salary at the end of May 2013 was  not
    before the respondent at the date of decision  and  had  been  provided
    only at the appeal hearing (contrary to the grounds  of  appeal  before
    the FTT). However, it was, she said, a document  which  the  respondent
    could have requested pursuant to Rule 245AA [sic] because it was one of
    a series in sequential order.


 8. Secondly, Ms Akhter submitted  the  FTTJ  had  erred  in  finding  copy
    documents were not legible (paragraph 9] when the respondent had raised
    no issue about this  in  the  refusal  decision.  Finally,  the  FTTJ's
    proportionality assessment under Article 8 was erroneous.

 9. For the respondent, Mr Avery submitted there had been a  responsibility
    on the appellant to ensure that legible documents were provided to  the
    FTTJ, albeit the respondent had not identified this as an issue in  the
    refusal. It was not procedurally unfair for the FTTJ to  take  a  fresh
    point which had not been in issue between the parties.   He  considered
    the principal issue to  be  the  evidential  flexibility  requirements:
    paragraph 245AA [sic] could not apply because the application had  been
    refused for other reasons, namely the  lack  of  an  original  marriage
    certificate which, although with the British  High  Commission  at  the
    time, was not before the decision-maker.  He acknowledged the FTTJ  had
    been given the HSBC statement for May 2013 showing  a  credit  for  the
    sponsor's salary on 31 May 2013 and that  this  corresponded  with  the
    sponsor's payslip which had been produced  with  the  application.   He
    considered the reasoning in paragraph 9 to be  questionable:  he  could
    not understand it.  There was no error in the Article 8 assessment.

Discussion

10. The only specific reason identified by the respondent for refusing  the
    application under FM-SE was the failure of the appellant to produce  an
    HSBC bank statement showing  the  sponsor's  claimed  May  salary  (the
    latest statement supplied being one dated 18 May 2013). It is not clear
    why the FTTJ found it necessary to consider the remaining evidence  and
    make a finding that the bank statements for September to December  2012
    were "not fully legible" and did  not  "appear  to  show  corresponding
    salary payments ...".   It was implicit from the content of the refusal
    (albeit somewhat poorly phrased) that  the  respondent  considered  the
    appellant had produced sufficient evidence of the  sponsor's  financial
    status, apart from one bank statement: that post-dating  18  May  2013.
    Thus the FTTJ made an adverse finding on an issue which was not between
    the parties and on which she had not given the appellant an opportunity
    to make submissions. This is a procedural irregularity and an error  of
    law.  It is material because the FTTJ  then  relies  on  her  erroneous
    finding to determine that specified documentary  evidence  relating  to
    the  sponsor's  earnings  was  not  provided   with   the   application
    (irrespective of her findings with  regard  to  the  missing  May  2013
    statement).


11. I agree with Mr Avery that paragraph 9 of the decision is unclear.  The
    FTTJ states that "the appellant's [sic] HSBC account for May 2013 shows
    that he received on 31 May 2013 ï¿½1,341.39 from Bestway Cash and  Carry.
    However the payslip [sic] which is dated for the period 31 May 2013  is
    not shown in the HSBC Bank statements."  On the face of it,  this  does
    not make sense.

12. It is agreed by the parties that the missing  bank  statement  covering
    the end of May 2013 is the last in a series submitted by the  appellant
    in support of  her  application.  I  find  therefore  that  the  FTTJ's
    findings with regard to evidential flexibility are  unsustainable.  Not
    only did she  apply  the  wrong  paragraph  of  the  Immigration  Rules
    (paragraph 245AA instead of FM-SE.D) but  she  took  into  account  her
    erroneous findings with regard to illegible documents  in  finding  the
    evidential  flexibility  requirements  had  no  application.  This  was
    against the backdrop of her finding that the appellant had demonstrated
    compliance with the Immigration  Rules  insofar  as  her  marriage  was
    concerned (paragraph 8). These are errors of law which were material to
    the outcome.

13. The parties' representatives agreed that, in the event  of  my  finding
    one or more material errors of law,  I  should  set  aside  the  FTTJ's
    decision and remake it.  Both agreed that the decision with  regard  to
    the validity of the appellant's marriage should remain undisturbed.   I
    therefore preserve the  finding  at  paragraph  8  and  set  aside  the
    remaining findings of the FTTJ.

14. I am unable to accept Mr Avery's submission that  the  absence  of  the
    marriage certificate precluded the exercise  of  discretion  under  the
    evidential flexibility provisions. It was agreed by the parties  before
    me that the FTTJ's findings with regard to the validity of the marriage
    and production of the marriage certificate should  remain  undisturbed,
    being  unchallenged.   It  follows  therefore  that  the   only   issue
    precluding the grant of entry clearance was the missing bank  statement
    reflecting the sponsor's May 2013 salary.

15. I am satisfied that the respondent should  have  considered  exercising
    his discretion  pursuant  to  paragraph  D(aa)  of  FM-SE  because  the
    appellant had submitted "a  sequence  of  documents  and  some  of  the
    documents in the sequence have been omitted (e.g. if one bank statement
    from a series is missing)".  The respondent had received  a  series  of
    bank statements showing credits which matched those  in  the  sponsor's
    payslips. It  would  have  been  clear  to  him  that  a  further  such
    statement, immediately post-dating those  before  him,  was  likely  to
    exist.  The sole basis for refusal was that the appellant had failed to
    provide the last statement in the series, one which covered a  ten  day
    period to the end of May 2013, the date on which his salary was due  to
    be credited to his account. This has the hallmark of a  simple  mistake
    by the appellant and is covered by paragraph D(aa) of FM-SE.

16. Mr Avery has referred me to sub-paragraph (c) of D, to the effect  that
    "The decision-maker will not request documents where he or she does not
    anticipate that addressing the error or omission referred  to  in  sub-
    paragraph (b) will lead to a grant  because  the  application  will  be
    refused for other reasons.". However, the respondent has not challenged
    the  FTTJ's  finding  that  the  appellant  had   complied   with   the
    requirements of  E-ECP.2.7  with  regard  to  provision  of  her  valid
    marriage certificate. Therefore sub-paragraph (c)  has  no  application
    here: the only reason for the refusal was the  missing  May  2013  bank
    statement.

17. The discretion in Appendix FM-SE D is that of the  decision  maker  not
    the First-tier Tribunal or this Tribunal (Sultana  and  Others  (rules:
    waiver/further enquiry; discretion) [2014] UKUT 00540 (IAC),  paragraph
    18).

18. In summary, I  am  satisfied  the  respondent  should  have  considered
    exercising his discretion pursuant to  paragraph  D(aa)  of  FM-SE  and
    that, in the absence of any suggestion that he did so, the respondent's
    decision is not in accordance with  the  law  (UKUS  (Discretion:  When
    Reviewable) [2012] UKUT  00307  (IAC)).   The  appellant's  application
    remains outstanding for a lawful decision.


Decision

19. The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve
    material errors of law, as set out above.


20. I preserve the findings of the FTTJ in paragraph 8 of her  decision.  I
    set aside the remaining findings.

21. I re-make the FTTJ's decision by allowing it to  the  extent  that  the
    decision is not in accordance with the law and the application  remains
    outstanding for the respondent to make a lawful decision.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008
Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.


Fee Award
The FTTJ made no fee award.  I now make a half fee award of  any  fee  which
has been paid or may be payable because the decision of the  FFTJ  has  been
partially set aside and remade to the extent that  the  application  remains
outstanding for a lawful decision to be made.
