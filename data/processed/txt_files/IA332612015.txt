Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Nicholson, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Ms Pal, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS



 1. The appellant  is  a  citizen  of  Nigeria  who  appealed  against  the
    respondent's decision to refuse him a residence card as confirmation of
    a right of residence under the EEA Regulations. His appeal against that
    refusal was dismissed by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Turquet ("the
    FTTJ") in a decision promulgated on 22 December 2016.

 2. No anonymity direction was made in the  First-tier  Tribunal;  nor  has
    such a direction been requested before me. None is required.

 3. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge I D Boyes
    on 25 July 2017 on the basis that the grounds of appeal were  arguable.
    No reasons were given for this conclusion.

Submissions

 4. Mr Nicholson, for the appellant, relied  on  detailed  written  grounds
    and, in addition, made lengthy oral submissions. I summarise  these  as
    follows:

      i) The FTTJ had misapplied the burden  of  proof  in  that  where  the
         respondent alleged abuse of rights or fraud, the burden of  proving
         that rested on the respondent (Rosa v SSHD [2016] EWCA Civ 14). The
         respondent provided no evidence to rebut that of the appellant.

     ii) The FTTJ found a discrepancy in the alternative descriptions of the
         appellant as "Admin Assistant" and "Virtual Admin Assistant".  This
         finding was not sustainable on the evidence. Furthermore, the  FTTJ
         had drawn on "personal experiential understanding" in  making  this
         finding. This was not open to her.

    iii) It was not open to the FTTJ to make adverse findings as a result of
         parallel lines of evidence. This had occurred with  regard  to  the
         way in which the appellant had found her job;  the  nature  of  her
         role, her hours of work, her holiday entitlement.

     iv) There was a reasonable explanation for the different  spellings  of
         the appellant's name. This was of no value in the assessment of the
         evidence; this was not an appeal relating to a sham marriage.

      v) The perceived discrepancies identified by the FTTJ did not exist.

 5. For the respondent, Ms Pal submitted that the findings were open to the
    FTTJ on the evidence. Even if  the  FTTJ  had  erroneously  taken  into
    account her own assessment of the role of an administrative  assistant,
    and this amounted to an error of law, this  was  immaterial  given  the
    other valid adverse findings on the evidence. The respondent had relied
    on the HMRC disclosure of the appellant's records of  employment  which
    did not refer to the claimed employment. There  were  no  P60s  and  no
    reasonable explanation for the lack of HMRC records.  It  was  accepted
    the burden was on  the  respondent  to  show  the  documents  were  not
    genuine,  but  the  FTTJ  had  seen  and  heard  the  evidence  of  the
    appellant's witnesses and was entitled to find the appellant's evidence
    was not reliable. The appellant merely disagreed with the findings.

 6. Mr Nicholson replied that it was difficult to separate paragraph 29  of
    the decision from the earlier findings. If that were  right,  the  FTTJ
    had based her findings on discrepancies which did not exist. Paragraphs
    29-31 could not stand on their own because  the  witnesses  would  have
    been found consistent. The explanation for the lack of HMRC records was
    the appellant's low income.  The FTTJ's view that Mr Odupitan was not a
    satisfactory witness was as a result of her earlier findings. If  those
    findings were not based on the evidence, her assessment of the  witness
    could not stand.  The respondent  had  not  discharged  the  burden  of
    proving fraud. He submitted that the decision was  perverse:  the  FTTJ
    had relied on discrepancies which did not exist.

Discussion

 7. The burden of proving a document is false rests  with  the  accuser.  I
    agree that Rosa is relevant here.  In this case the respondent had been
    provided by the appellant with various payslips and a letter issued  by
    Pytrops Ltd to demonstrate his former wife's employment. The respondent
    had  obtained  and  disclosed  a  letter  from  HMRC  setting  out  the
    appellant's former wife's employment history from 7 December 2009 to 30
    August 2015. The content  of  this  letter  was  not  disputed  by  the
    appellant before the FTTJ. It was submitted by Mr  Nicholson  that  the
    FTTJ should have taken into  account  that  the  appellant's  wife  had
    earned less than the  income  tax  threshold  and  this  explained  the
    absence of any record of the employment  with  HMRC.  However,  I  note
    that, according to the HMRC, most of  the  appellant's  income  in  the
    period shown was below the income tax threshold; only in the  tax  year
    2010/11 was tax deducted from her income.  The FTTJ cannot therefore be
    criticised for having failed to take this  potential  explanation  into
    account, particularly as the evidence of Mr Odupitan,  the  appellant's
    wife's purported employer, was that he could not provide an explanation
    for the absence of any record of this employment with HMRC [13].

 8. In her decision [19] the FTTJ notes the respondent initially had doubts
    about the authenticity of the employment because the  EEA  sponsor  was
    paid cash and payments could not be verified by reference to  her  bank
    statement. The respondent noted the employer had "very little  internet
    presence and an address more than a 50 minute drive away from where the
    Appellant claimed to have resided with his  EEA  Sponsor.  This  raised
    concerns as to whether it would be reasonable to travel such a way  for
    earnings of ï¿½435 per month." The FTTJ noted the HMRC evidence and that,
    in the light of this, the respondent did not consider the documents  in
    relation to the company to be genuine.

 9. At [30] the FTTJ states the "Appellant has failed to address the issues
    raised by the Respondent. The Appellant has not demonstrated  that  his
    EEA sponsor was employed by Pytrops as claimed.  He  has  not  provided
    credible evidence that Ms Cayol was a qualified person at the  date  of
    divorce 16.9.14. The Appellant has not satisfied me on the  balance  of
    probabilities that his wife was employed or  self-employed  as  claimed
    until the date of termination of the marriage. I do not  find  that  it
    satisfies me on the balance of probabilities that  she  was  exercising
    Treaty Rights on 5.11.2013" [31]. She goes  on  to  find  she  is  "not
    satisfied on the  balance  of  probabilities  that  the  Appellant  can
    satisfy the requirements of Regulation 10(5)(b)." [32].

10. In Rosa it was held that the legal burden was on the SSHD to prove that
    an otherwise valid marriage was a marriage  of  convenience  so  as  to
    justify the refusal of a residence  card  under  the  EEA  Regulations.
    Paragraphs 25 and 26 were cited in the application  for  permission  to
    appeal to this tribunal, but paragraph 27 is particularly relevant:

           "....When translated into the position before the tribunal, that
           is tantamount to saying  that  the  legal  burden  of  proof  in
           relation to marriage of convenience lies  on  the  Secretary  of
           State but that  if  the  Secretary  of  State  adduces  evidence
           capable of pointing to the conclusion that the marriage  is  one
           of convenience, the evidential burden shifts to the applicant".

    This was reiterated at the end of  paragraph  29  where  the  Court  of
    Appeal interpreted the guidance in Papajorgji (EEA spouse - marriage of
    convenience) Greece [2012] UKUT 00038 (IAC):

           "The result that I think the  tribunal  must  have  intended  is
           achieved if the legal burden of proof lies on the  Secretary  of
           State  throughout  but  the  evidential  burden  can  shift,  as
           explained in Papajorgji. In my judgment,  that  is  the  correct
           analysis."

11. In the present case, the respondent relied on unchallenged evidence  to
    the effect hat the HMRC had no record of the appellant's working during
    the period in question. Whilst the FTTJ did not cite  the  guidance  in
    Rosa, she accepted the  evidence  from  HMRC.   Given  the  absence  of
    challenge to that evidence, this was appropriate.  Whilst the FTTJ  did
    not state in so many words that the evidential burden had passed to the
    appellant, in practice she proceeded on that basis.  For this reason, I
    find that the FTTJ's error of law in failing to identify the burden was
    on the respondent was immaterial, given the lack of  challenge  to  the
    HMRC material and the failure of the witnesses to provide a  reasonable
    explanation for the  absence  of  any  HMRC  record  of  the  sponsor's
    employment during the relevant period.   The respondent  had  satisfied
    the legal burden of proof. The evidential burden  thus  passed  to  the
    appellant.

12. The FTTJ  considered  the  evidence  of  the  appellant  carefully  and
    thoroughly. She identified various discrepancies in that  evidence  and
    whilst some were minor, others were more serious. She identified  inter
    alia the lack of correlation between  cash  income  received  and  bank
    statement entries, the failure of the EEA sponsor's employer to provide
    evidence the EEA sponsor had been on the company's payroll  [29],  that
    Mr Odupitan did not know the  EEA  sponsor's  holiday  entitlement,  Mr
    Odupitan's inability to explain the absence of any HMRC record  of  the
    EEA national's employment at Pytrops [29],  the  inconsistency  in  the
    evidence of the appellant and his brother as to the nature of  the  EEA
    sponsor's work at the date of marriage [30] and the misspelling of  the
    EEA sponsor's name [30].  The FTTJ also identified a discrepancy in the
    appellant's evidence as regards  the  formal  description  of  the  EEA
    sponsor's role: Virtual Admin Assistant  as  against  Admin  Assistant.
    The FTTJ noted there was no explanation for the change  in  job  title.
    That finding is not challenged;  the  appellant  merely  contends  that
    there is little difference between them and not enough  to  justify  an
    adverse credibility finding.  The  degree  of  weight  given  to  these
    inconsistencies and discrepancies is a matter for the  FTTJ.  She  took
    them into account in the round and it was appropriate for her to do so.

13. I agree with the appellant that it was inappropriate for  the  FTTJ  to
    give her own meaning to the job  title  of  "Admin  Assistant"  and  to
    decide, effectively, that the description in the evidence of that  role
    did not justify such a title.  To do so was to prefer her  own  opinion
    of the role of an administrative assistant as against  the  description
    in the evidence. However, this is one issue amongst many valid  matters
    of concern for the FTTJ as regards the evidence  before  her.  Even  if
    this were discounted, the remaining discrepancies, taken in the  round,
    were sufficient to undermine the reliability of the evidence as to  the
    EEA national's employment.

14. It was not incorrect for the FTTJ to note the evidence of  Mr  Odupitan
    that the EEA sponsor's job had been advertised on Gumtree and that  the
    appellant's evidence had been that she found the job through  a  church
    member.  Whilst it may be  that  these  amount  to  parallel  lines  of
    evidence, as submitted by Mr Nicholson, in the absence of evidence that
    these two lines  were  linked  the  FTTJ  was  entitled  to  find  them
    discordant.

15. Mr Nicholson summarised by submitting that this appeal was  pursued  on
    the basis that the FTTJ's findings were perverse, including being based
    on no evidence at all.   A  challenge  on  the  grounds  of  perversity
    involves a high bar (R & Ors v SSHD [20905] EWCA Civ 982). The findings
    of the FTTJ were reasonably open to her on  the  evidence  before  her,
    notwithstanding the errors I have identified above. Those  errors  were
    not material to the outcome.  The FTTJ's findings  are  sustainable  on
    the evidence notwithstanding her failure to place the legal  burden  of
    proof  on  the  respondent  initially  and  her   ascribing   her   own
    interpretation of the EEA national's job title. The FTTJ  was  entitled
    to find that the appellant's documentary and witness evidence  was  not
    sufficiently reliable for a finding that  the  EEA  national  had  been
    employed by Pytrops, as claimed.

16. For these reasons, there is no material error  of  law  in  the  FTTJ's
    decision and reasons.

Decision

17. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of a material error on a point of law.

18. I do not set aside the decision.
