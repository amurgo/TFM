Representation:
For the claimant: Mr A Burrett, instructed by EA Law Solicitors
For the appellant:     Mr P Duffy, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Bird promulgated 25.11.14, allowing on  human
    rights grounds the  claimant's  appeal  against  the  decision  of  the
    Secretary of State, dated 12.3.14, to remove her from the  UK  pursuant
    to section 10 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999.  The Judge  heard
    the appeal on 28.10.14.

 2. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Fisher  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    16.1.15.

 3. Thus the matter came before me on 9.4.15 as  an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 4. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Bird should be set aside.

 5. Judge Bird dismissed the appeal on immigration grounds but  allowed  it
    on article 8, finding it unreasonable to expect the  claimant,  or  her
    partner or children to leave the UK, and not in the best  interests  of
    the first child, diagnosed with diabetes.

 6. The grounds of application for permission to  appeal  assert  that  the
    judge erred in law by failing to have regard  to  the  public  interest
    considerations under section 117B of the 2002 Act.

 7. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Fisher noted that  although  it
    is clear that the judge was addressed on  section  117B,  the  decision
    contains no reference to any  of  the  public  interest  considerations
    under that section. "The judge was obliged to have  regard  to  Sec  17
    when considering the public interest question. It is arguable that  she
    failed to do so, and  that  her  conclusions  on  proportionality  are,
    therefore, flawed. Accordingly, permission to appeal is granted."

 8. I find that there is no consideration in the decision  of  the  section
    117B public interest considerations, which in this case  would  include
    that, immigration control is in the public interest; that little weight
    should be given to a private life or a relationship  developed  with  a
    partner whilst the claimant has been unlawfully present in the UK;  and
    potentially as to the claimant's English language  ability.  These  are
    very significant considerations and their  absence  from  the  decision
    renders the article 8 proportionality assessment rather  one-sided  and
    unfair to the Secretary of State and the public interest, so that it is
    flawed.

 9. The judge also erred at �22 in stating that as the claimant was in  the
    UK without lawful authority she could not meet E-LTRP 2.2. That is  not
    required if the claimant can meet E-LTRP 1.2-1.12, and E-LTRP 2.1,  and
    EX1 applies. To that extent the refusal decision was also in  error  at
    �24.

10. Similarly, in relation to an application for indefinite leave to remain
    as the parent of a child under R-LTRPT both the decision of the  First-
    tier Tribunal and the  refusal  decision  of  the  Secretary  of  State
    misstates at �27 & �28 the requirements of the Rules, and suggests that
    the claimant cannot meet E-LTRPT 3.1. The claimant has to meet  E-LTRPT
    2.2 -2.4 and E-LTRPT 3.1 and demonstrate that EX1 applies. There is  no
    reason why the claimant fails under E-LTRPT 3.1, as she was not in  the
    UK as a visitor or with temporary admission. By E-LTRPT 3.2 she can  be
    in the UK unlawfully, provided EX1 applies.

11. The judge was mislead and in error to state that the  application  fell
    to be refused under Appendix FM, for the reasons set out in �27 and �28
    of the refusal decision, without first considering whether the claimant
    could meet either EX1(a)  in  relation  to  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    relationship with a child under the age of 18 who is a British  citizen
    and whether it would be reasonable to expect the child to leave the UK;
    or EX1(b) a genuine and subsisting relationship with a partner  who  is
    in the UK and a British citizen and whether  there  are  insurmountable
    obstacles to family life with that partner continuing outside  the  UK,
    with insurmountable  obstacles  defined  by  EX2  as  very  significant
    difficulties faced by the applicant  or  their  partner  in  continuing
    family life outside the UK and which could not  be  overcome  or  would
    entail very serious hardship for the applicant or their partner.

12. I note that there are a number of flaws in  the  layout,  language  and
    considerations in the refusal decision, some of which may  have  misled
    the First-tier Tribunal Judge. For example, at �34 there  is  reference
    to "the ten year route." Nevertheless, it remains the case  that  there
    has not been proper consideration of  Appendix  FM  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal. Whilst EX1 was separately considered in the refusal decision,
    the judge made no such consideration. It  follows  that  there  was  an
    entirely inadequate consideration of Appendix FM in the decision of the
    First-tier Tribunal.

13. Mr Burrett  submitted  that,  as  the  judge  conducted  an  article  8
    assessment outside the Rules it which it  was  found  unreasonable  and
    disproportionate on the facts of this case to remove the claimant,  the
    errors were not material, as the outcome would still have been to allow
    the appeal, even if the claimant did not meet the requirements  of  the
    Rules. However, I do not accept that necessarily follows,  even  though
    the claimant has a genuine and subsisting relationship with  a  British
    partner  and  two  British  children.  An  assessment  whether  it   is
    unreasonable to expect either child to leave the UK,  following  EX1(a)
    must take into account the situation of the parents. Whether there  are
    insurmountable obstacles to family life being continued outside the UK,
    must be relevant to the assessment as to whether it  is  reasonable  to
    expect the children to leave the UK.   Further,  whether  the  claimant
    meets the requirements of the Rules is highly relevant to any article 8
    proportionality assessment.

14. In the circumstances, whilst the outcome of the  appeal  could  be  the
    same, I find that it does not necessarily follow; it is not possible at
    this stage to conclude that the appeal would have to be allowed on  the
    facts of this case. It follows that the decision must be set aside  for
    error of law to be remade.

15. When a decision of the First-tier Tribunal has been set aside,  section
    12(2) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 requires either
    that the case is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal  with  directions,
    or it must be remade by the Upper Tribunal. The scheme of the Tribunals
    Court and Enforcement Act 2007 does not assign the function of  primary
    fact finding to the  Upper  Tribunal.  The  errors  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge vitiates the findings of fact and the  conclusions  from
    those facts so that there has not been a  valid  determination  of  the
    issues in the appeal.

16. In all the circumstances, at the invitation and request the  claimant's
    representative to relist this appeal for a fresh hearing in the  First-
    tier Tribunal, I do so on the basis that this is  a  case  which  falls
    squarely within the Senior President's Practice Statement at  paragraph
    7.2. The effect of the error has been to deprive the parties of a  fair
    hearing and having regard to the overriding objective in rule 2 to deal
    with cases fairly and justly, including with the avoidance of delay,  I
    find that it is appropriate to remit  this  appeal  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal to determine the appeal afresh.

17. Whilst  it  seems  to  me  that  much  of  the  factual  background  is
    uncontentious, it would make the task of the First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    more difficult to preserve the factual findings. In the  circumstances,
    the decision should be made afresh.

Conclusions:

18. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should  be
    set aside.

                    I set aside the decision.

                    I remit the decision in the  appeal  to  the  First-tier
                    Tribunal to be made afresh.

Consequential Directions

19. The appeal is to be relisted for a fresh hearing before the  First-tier
    Tribunal at Taylor House before any First-tier Tribunal  Judge,  except
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Bird;

20.  It has been listed for 15.5.15, with an estimate of 1.5 hours;

21. Either party may adduce further evidence, such evidence  to  be  served
    and lodged with the Tribunal no later than 7 days before the hearing in
    the First-tier Tribunal.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.




Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The outcome of the appeal remains to be decided.
