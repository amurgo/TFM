Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr P Lewis, Counsel instructed by Dexter Montague &
                  Partners          Solicitors
For the Respondent:   Mr R Hopkin Home Office Presenting Officer


   1. In MS (Ivory Coast) [2007] EWCA Civ 133  it  was  accepted,  following
      Ciliz v Netherlands (Application no. 29192/95) [2000] ECHR 365; [2000]
      FLR 469, that a decision to remove an  applicant  in  the  process  of
      seeking a contact order may violate Article 8 ECHR, in  particular  on
      the basis that removal of  a  parent/applicant  during  contact  order
      proceedings would be unlawful because it prejudged the outcome of  the
      contact proceedings and, more importantly, denied  the  applicant  all
      possibility of any further meaningful involvement in  the  proceedings
      which may breach Article 6 ECHR.


   2. A refusal to adjourn proceedings before the Tribunal may have  similar
      consequences.


   3. It is the respondent's practice (consistent with the Human Rights  Act
      1998), not to remove or deport parent(s)/parties when family or  other
      court  proceedings  are  current  and  to  grant  short   periods   of
      discretionary leave, to  extend  temporary  admission,  or  release  a
      person pending the outcome of  the  family  proceedings.  The  use  of
      curtailment is discretionary in such circumstances  (see  Home  Office
      Guidance re-issued in October 2010).

   4. Where such a case arises before the  Tribunal  it  is  usual  for  the
      appeal to be allowed pursuant to Article 8 ECHR , rather than for  the
      proceedings to remain within the  Tribunal  system  to  be  adjourned,
      perhaps more than once. The respondent  will  normally  then  grant  a
      short period of discretionary leave bearing in mind any relevant facts
      found by, or observations of an  Immigration  Judge.  It  is  for  the
      respondent to decide on the period of leave in each case.

   5. Where an application for contact (or a residence order, or  for  other
      relief) is successful then a parent/party  may  make  application  for
      further leave to remain in the UK. If unsuccessful, then  it  will  be
      for the respondent to consider what steps to take in relation to  that
      individual.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


    1. This appeal is being dealt with under  the  transitional  provisions
       relating to the transfer of functions of the Asylum and  Immigration
       Tribunal (AIT) to the Upper Tribunal.


    2. The appellant, a citizen of Morocco, whose date of birth is given as
       15 July 1976, appeals the decision of the respondent made on 11  May
       2009 to curtail his leave to remain in  the  UK,  pursuant  to  para
       323(ii) of HC 395, the  respondent  not  being  satisfied  that  the
       appellant's marriage was subsisting (see para 281(iii) of HC395), he
       having originally been granted leave to enter  as  a  spouse  on  28
       November 2007 until 19 November 2009, but having separated from  his
       wife in or around September 2008 after the marriage broke down.  The
       appellant appealed to an immigration judge.  He  accepted  that  his
       marriage was no longer subsisting and that he could not  succeed  in
       showing that he met the requirements of the immigration  rules,  but
       sought permission to remain in the United Kingdom (UK) under article
       8 ECHR  in  order  to  pursue  an  existing  application  in  family
       proceedings for an order for contact with his daughter.

    3. By a determination issued on 19 May 2009 Immigration Judge M A Khan,
       sitting at Hatton Cross, dismissed  the  appeal,  having  refused  a
       request for an adjournment of these proceedings pending the  outcome
       of his application for an  order  for  contact  with  his  daughter.
       Immigration Judge Khan finds that as the appellant at present has no
       contact with the child, he does not enjoy family life in the UK  and
       that he has limited private life given that he has been  working  in
       the UK, but that the public interest in his  removal  outweighs  any
       interference with that private life and removal is  necessary  in  a
       democratic society and he can continue his private life from Morocco
       by correspondence and telephone.

    4. The judge then finds that there is provision in the rules for  those
       who already have contact with their children and want to pursue that
       contact but the appellant has had no contact since June 2008.  There
       is no CAFCASS report to date and the position is uncertain. He finds
       that there are no removal directions yet and that if  the  appellant
       manages to gain  contact  before  the  respondent  decides  to  give
       directions for removal, then he can provide further evidence at  any
       hearing of his appeal on removal.

    5. The appellant sought permission to appeal and on 14 June 2010 Senior
       Immigration Judge Goldstein found  that  the  grounds,  particularly
       those relating to the refusal of the Immigration  Judge  to  adjourn
       the proceedings, arguably showed that the  judge  may  have  made  a
       material error of law for all or some of the reasons  given  in  the
       grounds.

    6. He gave directions for the further conduct of the appeal on 12  July
       2010, and it is in this way that it comes before me now.

    Submissions

    7. Mr Lewis indicated that there was now a final hearing listed for  26
       November in the proceedings in the family court, at  Bristol  County
       Court, and that a CAFCASS Report was in preparation although not yet
       disclosed to the parties to those proceedings. He  relied  upon  his
       grounds and submitted  that  the  judge  had  failed  to  apply  the
       guidance in MS (Ivory Coast) v SSHD [2007] EWCA Civ 133 (22 February
       2007) in failing to adjourn the proceedings and that it would  be  a
       breach of Article 8 rights to remove the appellant  now.  He  relied
       upon his grounds in submitting that the appeal should be allowed and
       the  appellant  granted  a  period   of   discretionary   leave   as
       appropriate.

    8. Mr Hopkin submitted that in the future the provisions of  para  248A
       of HC395 which deal with an application for leave  to  remain  as  a
       person exercising rights of access (sic) to a child resident in  the
       UK,  would be available to the appellant, but  in  the  meantime  he
       conceded that the judge had fallen into material error  of  law  for
       the reasons advanced by Mr Lewis and was equally content that either
       the appeal be allowed and a period of discretionary  leave  granted,
       or that these proceedings be  stayed  pending  the  outcome  of  the
       family proceedings.

    9.  Mr  Lewis,  in  response,  submitted  that  rather  than  stay  the
       proceedings, in the light of the guidance in MS (Ivory  Coast),  the
       correct course was to allow the appeal and direct that discretionary
       leave be granted.  It was important not to  potentially  affect  the
       family proceedings and the appellant  was  paying  privately  to  be
       represented in these proceedings, and was  raising  article  6  ECHR
       concerns. There appeared to me  to  be  no  good  reason  why  these
       proceedings should remain extant within the tribunal at  this  time,
       and in the light of the matters to which Mr Lewis drew attention and
       to which I return below, I took the view that the better course  was
       for the appeal to be allowed pursuant to article 8 ECHR and for  the
       appellant to be granted a period of leave to  enable  him  to  focus
       fully  upon  the  family  proceedings  from  a  position  of   legal
       entitlement to be present in the UK.

   10. Mr Hopkin was content that the appeal be allowed and indicated  that
       he would recommend a period of discretionary leave of nine months to
       enable  the  clarification  of  the  position  within   the   family
       proceedings.

   11. However, it is important that time be  taken  to  set  out  in  some
       detail, more of the facts of the case, of the guidance in MS  (Ivory
       Coast), and the reasons for its existence, as well  as  the  reasons
       why the judge got it wrong in this case, as summarised by  Mr  Lewis
       in his skeleton argument, to which I now refer.

   12. The appellant is a national of Morocco who  entered  the  UK  on  28
       November 2007 and was granted leave  as  the  spouse  of  a  British
       national. He was granted leave until 19th November 2009 but,  in  or
       around  September  2008,  his  relationship  broke  down  and   they
       separated.  The appellant set out in some detail  the  circumstances
       of the relationship with his wife in his statement  but  fundamental
       to this appeal is that on 12 March 2006 the  appellant's  wife  gave
       birth to their daughter, YB.


   13. In or around November 2008 the appellant sought advice with  respect
       to having contact with his daughter and his wife  commenced  divorce
       proceedings.  The Children Act proceedings have been the subject  of
       substantial delays.  None of that delay  appears  to  have  been  on
       account of  the  action,  or  indeed  inaction,  of  the  appellant.
       Approximately one year ago CAFCASS were ordered to prepare a  report
       in the family proceedings.  They have still not  produced  a  report
       and it is understood  that  those  acting  on  his  behalf  are  now
       considering challenging that  failure  by  way  of  Judicial  Review
       proceedings.

   14. On 12 February 2009 the Secretary of State wrote  to  the  appellant
       and informed him  of  his  intention  to  curtail  his  leave.   The
       appellant states that he did not receive  that  letter  and  so  was
       unable to respond.  The Secretary of State then proceeded to curtail
       the appellant's leave.  The appellant appealed out of  time  against
       that decision and time was extended.

    Failure to adjourn


   15. The central ground of appeal before the Immigration Judge was  that,
       pending the outcome of the Children Act proceedings, it would be  in
       breach of the appellant's private and family life  and  right  to  a
       fair trial (Articles 6 and 8 ECHR) to be frustrated in his  attempts
       to obtain contact with  his  daughter  through  the  family  courts.
       Detailed grounds of appeal were lodged against that decision and  it
       was listed for hearing.  The matter was adjourned on three occasions
       on account of the fact of the delays in the Family Court.  When this
       matter was listed for hearing on 10 May 2010 a  further  application
       for adjournment was made.

   16. It was explained to the Immigration Judge that there  had  been  yet
       more delay in obtaining the CAFCASS report but the matter  had  been
       listed to be heard on 28 May 2010.  Counsel (Mr Lewis) informed  the
       Immigration Judge that he had spoken to the solicitor  with  conduct
       of the family proceedings and she anticipated that the report  would
       be prepared shortly, though there could be no  guarantee.   She  had
       confirmed the contents of her letter dated 7 May 2010 to Counsel but
       also emphasized that she was of the view that an important factor in
       the Children Act proceedings would  be  whether  the  appellant  was
       working and whether he  had  adequate  accommodation  to  facilitate
       contact.

   17. An application was made for the matter to be adjourned  pending  the
       outcome of those proceedings.  The Home Office was asked their  view
       of the application and an experienced  Presenting  Office  expressly
       stated that they did not object.  The facts as outlined  above  were
       referred to in support of the application as was the decision of the
       European Court of Human Rights in Ciliz v The Netherlands  [2000]  2
       ELR 469.  In that case the ECHR  found  there  to  be  violation  of
       Article 6 and 8 and stated as follows:

        "The authorities, through their failure to coordinate  the  various
        proceedings touching on the applicant's family  rights,  have  not,
        therefore, acted in a manner which has enabled family  ties  to  be
        developed (see the Keegan judgment cited above, p. 19, � 50)"

   18. It was submitted that the AIT had previously found that it would not
       be appropriate to proceed and that all  that  had  changed  was  the
       lapse of time.  That lapse of time had not in anyway been caused  or
       prolonged by the appellant.  There would be  no  prejudice  and  the
       Secretary  of  State  in  any  event  was  not  objecting   to   the
       application.  It was contended that in the interests of justice, and
       to ensure that the rights  of  the  appellant  and  his  child  were
       properly protected, the appeal should be adjourned.


   19. The Immigration Judge refused the adjournment and  the  only  reason
       given was that "this court cannot be kept waiting forever".  In  the
       determination the Immigration Judge states as follows: (paragraph 6)


        "This Tribunal is of the opinion  that  this  jurisdiction  is  not
        bound by any future rights that the appellant  may  be  granted  by
        another jurisdiction.  This  appeal  is  against  the  respondent's
        decision to curtail  the  appellant's  leave  as  a  spouse.   This
        Tribunal cannot be kept waiting in anticipation of  an  outcome  of
        another jurisdiction and especially  where  there  is  no  rule  or
        procedure or authority permitting such a delay  in  proceedings  in
        this tribunal.  The adjournment request is refused and the case  is
        to proceed"


   20. I see no reason to doubt Mr Lewis' summary of  that  application  to
       the judge, the fact of which is recorded in the  judge's  record  of
       proceedings on 10 May 2010.


   21. It is contended that in refusing  the  adjournment  the  Immigration
       Judge misdirected himself.  Whilst "this Tribunal" may not be  bound
       by any future "rights that the appellant may be granted  by  another
       jurisdiction" it would clearly be extremely relevant to  the  issues
       to be determined if contact is ordered to take place  with  a  child
       who is a  British  national.   Whilst  the  appellant's  appeal  was
       against the respondent's decision to curtail his leave,  as  a  one-
       stop appeal the detailed  grounds  alleged  that  the  decision  was
       contrary to Articles 6 and 8 ECHR and was not therefore confined  to
       this issue.  Indeed it was specifically stated in those  grounds  of
       appeal as follows:


        "The appellant's appeal ought to be adjourned pending  the  outcome
        of the Children Act proceedings.  In the absence of this  following
        the decision in MS (Ivory Coast) the appellant's appeal ought to be
        allowed under Article 6 and  8  of  the  ECHR,  and  the  appellant
        granted discretionary leave pending the outcome of the Children Act
        proceedings"


   22. It is contended that the Immigration Judge was wrong to assert  that
       there  was  no  rule  or  procedure  permitting  such  a  delay   in
       proceedings in this Tribunal.   The  Immigration  Judge  had  power,
       pursuant to section 5(3))h) of the  Tribunal  Procedure  (First-tier
       Tribunal) Rules 2009, to adjourn the proceedings.  Similarly, he was
       wrong to find there was no  authority  in  support  of  taking  such
       action and indeed he was specifically referred to  the  decision  in
       Ciliz  v  The  Netherlands  [2000]  2  ELR  469.    Accordingly  his
       statement that there was an absence of any such  authority  amounted
       to a material misdirection.


   23. The Immigration Judge later stated as follows: (paragraph 29)


        "These uncertainties [in  the  family  court  proceedings]  remain.
        There are currently no removal directions  against  the  appellant.
        Should he manage to gain contact in the mean time, it will be  open
        to him to provide further evidence at any further  hearing  of  his
        case upon removal"

   24. The Immigration Judge appears to have assumed that  there  would  be
       "further hearing of his case upon removal" but fails to identify  on
       what basis the appellant would obtain such a further  appeal.   This
       is a one-stop appeal where the appellant is obliged to raise all the
       issues in relation to his case.  Again,  it  is  contended  that  in
       assuming that the appellant would be able to raise these issues at a
       further hearing  the  Immigration  Judge  misdirected  himself  when
       determining whether it would be against the interests of justice for
       the appeal to proceed.


   25. It was specifically submitted in support of the application that  if
       the appeal were to proceed and, on the basis of the  facts  as  they
       presently stood, the Immigration Judge were to find that articles  6
       and 8 would not be breached, the effect would be the appellant would
       no longer have any basis for remaining  in  the  UK.   Even  if  the
       Secretary of State were to comply with the policy  of  not  removing
       those who are involved in family proceedings the appellant would  no
       longer be permitted to work nor would he be entitled to any support.
         Accordingly  he  would  lose   his   job   and   potentially   his
       accommodation.   Given  the  importance  that  that  could  have  in
       relation to his application for contact with his child (as confirmed
       by his family law solicitor) the  decision  of  the  Tribunal  could
       potentially have a significant impact upon  his  ability  to  pursue
       contact with his daughter.  In such circumstances the rights of both
       the appellant and his child would have to be considered.

   26. The Immigration Judge makes no reference at all to  this  submission
       when giving his reasons for refusing the adjournment.

   27. It is contended that in all of  the  circumstances  the  Immigration
       Judge should properly have adjourned the case.  Alternatively, it is
       contended  that  the  failure   to   adequately   address   relevant
       submissions and/or provide  adequate  reasons  for  rejecting  those
       submission amounted to a material error of law.


Failure to consider with proper scrutiny

   28. It is a trite submission that in cases involving human rights  there
       is a requirement to consider the evidence with an anxious  scrutiny.
       It is contended that the consideration recorded by  the  Immigration
       Judge to have been given to  the  appeal  would  indicate  that  the
       Immigration Judge failed to consider the appeal with  that  standard
       of care.  The Immigration Judge records:


        "The appellant's case is set out in his application  form  and  the
        interview with the entry clearance officer."

   29. In fact, there is neither  an  application  form  nor  an  interview
       record.


   30. The Immigration Judge then states that: (paragraph 19)


        "Notice of appeal is expressed in general terms only and  does  not
        address any of the detailed matters raised by the respondent in the
        refusal notice."


   31. The Judge was referred  to  the  grounds  of  appeal  which,  it  is
       contended, cannot reasonably be described as having  been  expressed
       in "general  terms".   They  clearly  address  the  history  of  the
       application and provide a specific  response,  based  upon  law  and
       authority, as to why the reasons given by  the  Secretary  of  State
       were wrong.  The  failure  by  the  Immigration  Judge  to  properly
       consider or review the grounds of appeal is material given the overt
       failure by the Immigration  Judge  to  make  any  reference  to  the
       authorities cited in those grounds of appeal which were  fundamental
       to the issues to be determined.


   32. Those grounds were expanded upon and developed in submissions before
       the Immigration  Judge.   The  Immigration  Judge  was  specifically
       referred to the policy of the Secretary of State not  to  remove  an
       individual who is applying through the  family  courts  for  contact
       with their children.   The Immigration Judge was  also  referred  to
       and provided with a copy of the published policy on  Curtailment  of
       Leave which states that the use of curtailment  is  discretionary  -
       and  specifically  cites  the  example  of  where  children  of   an
       individual are present in the UK as an example of  where  discretion
       may be exercised not to curtail leave.   It was contended  that  the
       existence of such discretion and policies were clearly  relevant  to
       any assessment of proportionality.

   33. The Immigration Judge was referred to a letter from the  appellant's
       family law solicitor dated  7  May  2010  that  confirmed  that  the
       appellant's presence in the UK was fundamental  to  his  ability  to
       pursue the proceedings for contact with  his  child.   He  was  then
       referred to the decision of the EHCR  in  Ciliz  v  The  Netherlands
       [2000] 2 ELR 469 where a challenge was brought by a Turkish national
       who had been pursuing an application for  contact  with  his  child.
       The applicant in that case was accused of having  shown  little  and
       then intermittent interest in the child and  of  only  pursuing  the
       application as a means of remaining in  the  Netherlands.  The  ECHR
       found  that  the  removal  of  the  applicant  did  amount   to   an
       interference and stated as follows: (paragraphs 71-72)


        "In the view of the Court, the authorities not only  prejudged  the
        outcome of the proceedings relating to the question  of  access  by
        expelling the applicant when they did, but, and  more  importantly,
        they denied the applicant all possibility of any meaningful further
        involvement in those proceedings for  which  his  availability  for
        trial meetings in particular was obviously of essential importance.
        It can, moreover, hardly  be  in  doubt  that  when  the  applicant
        eventually obtained a visa to return to the Netherlands  for  three
        months in 1999, the mere passage of time had resulted in a de facto
        determination  of  the  proceedings  for  access  which   he   then
        instituted (see the W. v. the United Kingdom judgment cited  above,
        p. 29, � 65). The authorities, through their failure to  coordinate
        the various proceedings touching on the applicant's family  rights,
        have not, therefore, acted in a manner  which  has  enabled  family
        ties to be developed (see the Keegan judgment cited above, p. 19, �
        50).


        In sum,  the  Court  considers  that  the  decision-making  process
        concerning both the question of the applicant's expulsion  and  the
        question of access did not afford the requisite protection  of  the
        applicant's interests as safeguarded by Article 8. The interference
        with the applicant's right under this provision was, therefore, not
        necessary in a democratic society. Accordingly, there  has  been  a
        breach of that provision".


   34. The Immigration Judge was then referred to the decision in MS (Ivory
       Coast), in which the Court of Appeal considered the case of Ciliz  v
       The Netherlands [2000] 2 ELR 496.  The Court held (para 75) that  it
       was not open to  the  AIT  to  rely  on  the  Secretary  of  State's
       assurance or undertaking that the appellant  would  not  be  removed
       until a contact application had been resolved. Some form of leave to
       remain ought to be granted if a breach of Article 8 is  anticipated,
       albeit that that might be quite short.


   35. It was submitted that the Secretary of State had implicitly accepted
       that  the  appellant  could  not  be  removed  whilst  the   contact
       proceedings are continuing and accordingly  it  was  contended  that
       leave should be granted to allow him to  pursue  those  proceedings.
       Specifically, the Immigration Judge was referred to the duty on  the
       court to ensure that the relevant issues could be determined in  the
       Children Act proceedings - Ciliz v Netherlands (ref)  where  it  was
       found that "the authorities, through their failure to coordinate the
       various proceedings touching on the applicant's family rights,  have
       not, therefore, acted in a manner which has enabled family  ties  to
       be developed (see the Keegan judgment cited above, p. 19, � 50)."

   36. It was submitted that the failure to do so or to regulate his  leave
       in order that he could pursue his  application  would  amount  to  a
       breach of Articles 6 and 8 ECHR.

   37. The Immigration Judge fails to make any reference to the submissions
       outlined above nor does he refer to any of the authorities cited  in
       support.  Indeed the Immigration Judge does  not  even  mention  the
       fact that it was being alleged that Article 6 as well as 8 was being
       relied upon. That failure amounts to a material error  of  law.   In
       Jain v SSHD [2000] INLR 71 at 76E-F per Schiemann LJ, in  describing
       what was necessary to demonstrate an error of law by the IAT: "I can
       add a third possible challenge which is made here, namely  that  the
       Tribunal's conclusions were not expressed with the requisite  degree
       of clarity or did not deal adequately with  the  main  submissions."
       Such error is also referred to in R (Iran) v SSHD  [2005]  EWCA  Civ
       982 at 9(ii) and (iii).

   38. The  only  apparent  reason  given  by  the  Immigration  Judge  for
       dismissing the appeal was his finding that  the  appellant  did  not
       enjoy family life  in  the  UK.   The  Immigration  Judge  makes  no
       reference to the  evidence  that  prior  to  the  breakdown  in  his
       marriage the appellant had been a committed father and cared for his
       daughter.  Nor does he refer to the evidence given as to why contact
       had not continued as being because of the opposition to that desired
       contact by the appellant's ex wife.

   39. The ECHR has repeatedly found that a bond amounting to  family  life
       within the meaning of Article 8 exists between the parents  and  the
       child born from their  marriage-based  relationship  and  that  such
       natural family relationship is not terminated by reason of the  fact
       that the parents separate or divorce as a result of which the  child
       ceases to live with one of its parents see Berrehab  v  Netherlands.
       It was contended that there is family  life  in  existence  and  the
       appellant is clearly making attempts to develop this, see  Keegan  v
       Ireland.  The  Immigration  Judge  makes  no   reference   to   this
       submission.

   40. Further even if,  which  is  not  accepted  by  the  appellant,  the
       Immigration Judge had been entitled to find that there was no family
       life in existence, the Immigration Judge makes no reference  to  the
       appellant's attempts  to  establish  contact  with  his  child  when
       considering the appellant's private life.  Such a factor is,  it  is
       contended, fundamental to the consideration of private life and  the
       failure to make any reference to it at  all  when  considering  this
       amounted to a material error of law.

   41. As indicated, Mr Hopkin conceded, and,  I  find,  rightly  so,  that
       there had been a material error of law through failure to apply  the
       guidance in MS  (Ivory  Coast),  and  Mr  Hopkin  did  not  seek  to
       challenge any of the other grounds advanced for the  reasons  given,
       nor to defend the determination of  the  Immigration  Judge  in  any
       respect.

   42. I am satisfied that the arguments advanced by Mr Lewis on behalf  of
       the appellant  are  all  made  good,  for  the  reasons  given,  and
       therefore  find  that  there  is  material  error  of  law  in   the
       determination of  the  Immigration  Judge,  and  in  re-hearing  the
       matter,  recalling  the  consent  of  Mr  Hopkins  and  indeed   his
       submission that the appeal be allowed  on  Article  8  grounds,  the
       appeal is dismissed under the Immigration Rules  and  allowed  under
       Article 8 ECHR.

   43. I also recall that  Mr  Hopkin  will  be  recommending  a  grant  of
       discretionary leave of at least 9 months to enable the appellant  to
       participate as fully as is possible in the  family  proceedings.  As
       has been said, assuming that he were to be successful, then he would
       be able to make an application for further leave under para 248A  of
       HC395.

   44. The appeal is dismissed under the Immigration Rules.

   45. The appeal is allowed pursuant to Article 8  ECHR  and  a  grant  of
       discretionary leave of an appropriate period will normally follow.
