                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal to the Upper Tribunal brought by S M A S a citizen of
    the USA (born 15th January 1949) against the decision of the First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Kelly) which in a  determination  promulgated  on  13th
    December 2013 dismissed his appeal against the Respondent's decision of
    27th June 2013 refusing to grant him further leave to remain in the UK.



Background

 2. The relevant parts  of  the  Appellant's  immigration  history  are  as
    follows: The Appellant entered the United Kingdom on various dates with
    lawful authority as a visitor. In April 2009, he once again entered the
    UK as a visitor and during this period of entry married Mrs S M S  (the
    Sponsor) in an Islamic ceremony, with the marriage being registered  at
    the parish church in Leeds on 6th June 2009.

 3. Following this period of leave, the Appellant returned to the  USA  but
    was last granted leave as a visitor for  six  months  from  17th  March
    2012. By 10th May 2012 he applied for further leave to  remain  with  a
    view to settlement. He has remained in the UK since his last  entry  on
    17th March 2012.

 4. The Appellant and Sponsor's first child A was born on 11th  March  2010
    and their second child N was born on 21st December 2012.

 5. Both  the  Appellant  and  the  Sponsor  have  children  from  previous
    relationships. The Appellant has three adult children living in the USA
    and the Sponsor has a son S born on 3rd May 1995 and who  resides  with
    her and the Appellant in the United Kingdom.

 6. On 9th May 2012 the Appellant applied to vary his leave  to  remain  in
    order to settle. This was refused by the Respondent on 27th June  2013.
    It is against this refusal that he appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.

The First-tier Tribunal Decision

 7. The appeal came before Judge Kelly who heard  evidence  from  both  the
    Appellant and  his  Sponsor.  Judge  Kelly  noted  that  the  Appellant
    accepted that he is unable to meet the requirements of the  Immigration
    Rules for leave to remain and  that  the  only  issue  before  him  was
    whether removal of the Appellant in  consequence  of  the  Respondent's
    refusal, would be incompatible with his rights under Article 8 ECHR.

 8. The Judge set out his findings in his determination  and  the  relevant
    one so far as this appeal is concerned are paragraphs 16, 17 and 22.

         "I also have no reason to disbelieve the testimony of the appellant
         and sponsor concerning their present circumstances  in  the  United
         Kingdom. I therefore accept that  A  is  settled  at  a  pre-school
         nursery, and that the family have a good  relationship  with  their
         neighbours at their rented property in Leeds. I  also  accept  that
         the appellant receives a US pension in the sum of $623 a month, and
         that the sponsor receives ï¿½130 a week by way of  Child  Tax  Credit
         plus Child Benefit  for  their  two  children.  Both  children  are
         British nationals. They are also entitled to  US  citizenship.  The
         appellant has already registered A's citizenship at the US  Embassy
         in London. However, whilst S is also entitled to US citizenship, it
         has not been possible to register this due to the  amount  of  time
         that the appellant has spent in the United  Kingdom  following  his
         most recent arrival in March 2012.

         I must first  consider  the  position  under  Appendix  FM  of  the
         Immigration Rules. For reasons  that  I  are  (sic)  considered  in
         detail below, I have concluded  that  it  would  be  reasonable  to
         expect the appellant's children, A  and  S,  to  leave  the  United
         Kingdom I order to reside in the United States of America.  I  also
         consider that it would be reasonable to expect the  sponsor  to  do
         so. It follows  from  this  that  the  appellant  cannot  meet  the
         requirements for leave under Section  Ex  of  Appendix  FM  to  the
         Immigration Rules.

         I have also concluded that it would be  reasonable  to  expect  the
         sponsor to live with the appellant and their children in  the  USA.
         She entered into her relationship with the appellant  knowing  that
         he might  not  be  permitted  to  settle  in  the  United  Kingdom.
         Moreover,  she  soon  afterwards  learnt  that  he  would  not   be
         permission  to  do  so  unless  she  found   reasonably   well-paid
         employment. Indeed, as recently as 2009, it had been her  intention
         to settle in the USA. This was notwithstanding the  fact  that  she
         was by then aware of her pregnancy with the Appellant's child.  The
         only factor that caused her to change her mind was S's  refusal  to
         leave the United Kingdom. However, S is now aged 18  years.  He  is
         thus capable of making his own decision as to where and  with  whom
         he wishes to live. He will not  always  necessarily  exercise  that
         choice in favour  of  living  with  his  mother.  It  is  therefore
         unreasonable for the  sponsor  to  expect  that  considerations  of
         general public policy and the prospects of those others who may  be
         affected thereby should take second place to her decision to remain
         with her adult son in the United Kingdom. This is particularly  so,
         having regard to the fact (as became plain at the hearing) that her
         view of these matters will remain unchanged, "however old he is"."

 9. Judge Kelly went on to dismiss the appeal.

10. The Appellant sought permission to appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal.  In
    granting permission Upper Tribunal Judge Renton said as follows.

     "The Judge also dismissed the appeal on  Article  8  ECHR  grounds.  He
    found that the Appellant had a family life with his wife and their  two
    British-born children. He also found that that  family  life  would  be
    interfered with by the  Respondent's  decision  to  such  a  degree  of
    gravity as to engage the Appellant's Article 8  rights  but  that  such
    interference was proportionate. In reaching that conclusion  the  Judge
    mistakenly believed that the Appellant's children were entitled  to  US
    citizenship. Further throughout the Determination  the  Judge  confused
    the name of the Appellant's youngest child with that of  his  step-son.
    These errors of fact and in particular the  latter  one  amount  to  an
    error of law following the decision in ML (Nigeria) v SSHD [2013]  EWCA
    Civ 844".

The Upper Tribunal Hearing

11. Before us Miss Singh relied on the grounds of application together with
    a skeleton argument. She followed the lines of  the  skeleton  argument
    and submitted that the  Judge  had  failed  to  consider  relevant  and
    material evidence from the Appellant, which had resulted in an  absence
    of quality reasoning. It is correct to say that at the outset, as shown
    in her skeleton argument, she conceded that the  Judge's  confusion  in
    wrongly referring to the Appellant's son N, as S (the name of his step-
    son) did not amount to a material error.

12. We consider that Miss Singh's reasons for  submitting  that  the  Judge
    erred in law were four fold.

      i) A failure to properly account for the Appellant's continuous period
         of stay in the UK.

     ii) A finding that the Appellant's youngest child  is  entitled  to  US
         citizenship  and  encompassed  in  this  the   finding   that   the
         Appellant's youngest child  is  entitled  to  dual-nationality  and
         encompassed in  this  a  failure  to  assess  the  consequences  of
         maintaining the refusal decision with respect  to  resettlement  of
         the children in the US.

    iii) A failure to take into account that  the  Appellant's  step-son  S,
         albeit that he is an adult, is a "troubled child  involved  in  low
         level criminality and is  in  need  of  the  guidance  and  support
         offered by his mother".

     iv) Failure to properly assess the economic well-being  of  the  United
         Kingdom with regard to this particular case in that the presence of
         the Appellant has contributed economically to the UK economy.  This
         is because he receives his US pension in  the  United  Kingdom  and
         therefore spends it here.

13. We deal with points (i), and (iv) firstly.  So  far  as  point  (i)  is
    concerned we find paragraph 4 of the Judge's determination sets out the
    issues and the criteria for meeting the  Immigration  Rules.  We  agree
    that the Judge has misquoted the decision  maker's  conclusion  in  the
    last sentence of paragraph 4. However nothing  turns  on  this  because
    paragraph 4 must be read in conjunction with paragraph 5 which sets out
    that the Appellant  (and  he  accepts  this)  is  unable  to  meet  the
    Immigration  Rules.  It  is  perfectly  clear  from  the  body  of  the
    determination that the Judge when referring to his decision  was  fully
    aware that the Appellant had been in the UK for a continuous period  in
    excess of fifteen months because he clearly sets  out  the  Appellant's
    immigration history.

14. So far as point (iv) is concerned  namely  that  the  Judge  failed  to
    properly assess the economic wellbeing of the UK,  we  find  no  favour
    with that challenge. Miss Singh's argument with respect is  a  circular
    one. She  submits  that  the  Appellant  contributes  to  the  economic
    wellbeing of the United Kingdom because his United State's  pension  is
    being received and spent here. This has the effect of his wife's income
    support of ï¿½71 per week being stopped. Thus there is a saving to the UK
    Treasury. As Judge Kelly pointed out the Appellant cannot  satisfy  the
    financial requirements of the Immigration Rules. This was  accepted  by
    the Appellant.

15. We turn now to what are perhaps the more weighty arguments put  forward
    by Miss Singh and are contained in points (ii) and (iii) These  matters
    revolve around the status of the Appellant's youngest child N; the best
    interests of the children and their family relationship of the  Sponsor
    and the Appellant and their children with the Sponsor's eldest  son  S.
    Miss Singh's challenge amounts to this. She states that the Judge erred
    when he said in paragraph 20,

         "Whilst there is what I understand to be a temporary impediment  to
         the registration of S's (sic) American citizenship, I am  satisfied
         that both children possess dual nationality".

    According to Miss Singh N does not possess  dual  nationality.  However
    neither party before us was able to assist us on how the Judge obtained
    his information. We look at paragraph 16 where the Judge states in  his
    findings,

         "Both children are British nationals. They are also entitled to  US
         citizenship. The Appellant has already registered  A's  citizenship
         at the US Embassy  in  London.  However  whilst  S  (sic)  is  also
         entitled to US citizenship, it has not been  possible  to  register
         this due to the amount of time that the Appellant has spent in  the
         United Kingdom following his most recent arrival in March 2012".

16. It is clear to us that the Judge has  obtained  this  information  from
    evidence placed before him. We therefore  consider  that  nothing  much
    turns on whether or not the Appellant's  youngest  child  actually  has
    dual nationality. The relevant point is that  the  Judge  was  informed
    that the youngest child would be entitled to US citizenship. There  has
    been  nothing  put  before  the  Judge,  nor  before  us,  by  way   of
    documentation from the US Embassy to say that the youngest child who is
    after all  the child of an American citizen is not entitled to American
    citizenship, provided the necessary registration is put in place.

17. The final point raised by Miss Singh concerns the relationship  of  the
    family members with the Sponsor's son S.

18. S is now an adult. He does not wish to relocate with the  other  family
    members to the USA. His mother does not wish to leave him  in  the  UK.
    That is a matter of choice.

19. Miss Singh urged upon us that S is a troubled child who has engaged  in
    low level criminal activity.  We  see  no  reference  to  this  in  the
    evidence before the Judge and it is hard therefore to see how the Judge
    can be said to have erred in not factoring this in when considering the
    proportionality exercise under Article 8 ECHR.

20. We accept that S has a relationship with his younger siblings but there
    was nothing before us to show that  it  was  anything  other  than  the
    normal emotional ties which can exist between adult family members  and
    their younger siblings.

21. Bringing all these factors together we are satisfied  that  the  First-
    tier Tribunal did not err in the conclusions reached, for  the  reasons
    given.
