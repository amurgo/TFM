                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. This is an appeal against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Burnett  ('the  Judge')  issued  on  1  November  2018  by  which   the
    appellant's appeal against the decision of the respondent to refuse  to
    grant entry clearance was dismissed.

 2. The appellant appeals with permission of  Deputy  Judge  of  the  Upper
    Tribunal Mailer by way of a decision sent to the  parties  on  19  June
    2019.



Anonymity

 3. No anonymity direction was issued by the Judge and no  application  for
    such direction was made before me.



Background

 4. The appellant is a national of Nepal and  is  presently  aged  31.  His
    sponsor is his mother. His father,  now  deceased,  joined  the  Gurkha
    regiment in 1961 and was discharged in 1970 after over eight  years  of
    service. He served in  Brunei  and  Borneo.  After  his  retirement  he
    remained in Nepal and was a farmer, working both on his  own  land  and
    that of neighbours. He died in 2011. Meanwhile one of his  sons,  Khem,
    secured entry clearance to this  country  as  a  student.  The  sponsor
    applied for settlement as the dependent widow of a Gurkha  soldier  and
    was granted indefinite leave to enter in March 2013. At the date of the
    appellant's application for entry clearance she resided  with  Khem  in
    this country. This remained the position as of 11 June 2018  when  Khem
    signed his witness statement, prepared for this appeal. However, by the
    date of the hearing in August 2018, Khem had relocated to the USA.  The
    appellant's six other siblings reside in Nepal.

 5. The appellant applied for entry  clearance  to  settle  in  the  United
    Kingdom  as  the  adult  dependent  relative  of  his  mother  and  the
    application was considered by the  respondent  in  light  of  the  Home
    Office's policy as outlined in Annex K, IDI Chapter 15 section 2A  13.2
    as amended on 5 January 2015. The application was refused by way  of  a
    decision dated 27 July 2017. The respondent observed that there was  no
    provision for entry clearance under the rules for  an  adult  dependent
    relative supported by the widow of an  ex-Gurkha  soldier.  As  to  the
    consideration of the application under the  policy,  it  was  observed,
    inter alia:

         'You are 28 years old. Your mother has been in the  UK  since  2013
         when she was issued an entry clearance visa. You have not mentioned
         any  personal  incapacity.  You  have  no  medical  conditions   or
         disability. You state that you are  unemployed.  I  note  that  you
         state that you have been in education. It is noted that you  are  a
         healthy educated adult and therefore it is reasonable to expect you
         to find gainful employment in your country of residence.  You  have
         submitted no evidence to demonstrate that  you  have  maintained  a
         family unit with your mother since she has been living  in  the  UK
         for over 4 years and that you are reliant on her for emotional  and
         financial support.

         For all of the reasons stated above, I am not  satisfied  that  you
         are wholly financially or emotionally dependent on your sponsor, as
         required under Annex K, Paragraph 9(5) of IDI Chapter  15,  section
         2A 13.2'



Hearing before the First-tier Tribunal

 6. The appeal was heard  on  17  August  2018.  The  sponsor  was  briefly
    examined by Mr. Balroop and then cross-examined.

 7. The appellant did not advance an argument that the decision  to  refuse
    him entry clearance was unlawful under the Immigration Rules. The ambit
    of the appeal was limited to article 8 grounds.

 8. The Judge refused the appeal by way of a decision sent to  the  parties
    on 1 November  2018.  At  paragraph  36  of  the  decision,  the  Judge
    reasoned:

         'It  is  necessary  to  assess  whether  the  support  is   'real',
         'committed' or 'effective' support. There is little in this case to
         actually show that the appellant is truly financially reliant  upon
         his mother and that the support she provides is real, committed  or
         effective. Although there are some money transfer receipts  in  the
         bundle there are no bank statements which show a  transfer  to  the
         appellant's account. The bank statements from Nepal of the  sponsor
         show that her deposits accumulated between 2016 and  2017.  It  was
         not until around June 2017 that there were  some  withdrawals  from
         her accounts. After that date the deposits once  again  accumulated
         until March 2018. The bank statements from Barclays show  that  the
         sponsor only receives around �109 per week which is just enough for
         her to survive and  little  else.  There  is  no  evidence  of  the
         financial situation of the appellant, i.e. his bank statements. The
         evidence was also not clear at all as to when  exactly  his  mother
         started to send any money to the appellant. The sponsor stated that
         the appellant received money from his siblings although  stated  he
         had to pay it back. I conclude from the evidence produced that  the
         appellant does receive some support from his other  family  members
         when he needs it. I conclude that there is little evidence that  he
         has a 'real', 'committed' or 'effective' support  provided  by  the
         sponsor.'

 9. This paragraph was subjected  to  detailed  forensic  analysis  by  Mr.
    Balroop before me.

10. The Judge further reasoned at paragraphs 37 to 39:

         'I do not consider that there is a real emotional  dependence  over
         and above the usual ties one would expect between mother  and  son.
         The appellant lives in the family home, a place where he has  lived
         all of his life. He is not alone and is in regular contact with his
         other family members (siblings and other  family  members).  It  is
         stated that the appellant farms and this  activity/employment  used
         to provide an income for the  entire  family  (the  appellant,  his
         father, mother and other siblings). The appellant's  mother  has  a
         number of family members in Nepal including her other children  and
         grandchildren  (these  are  the  appellant   siblings   and   their
         children). The appellant's mother travels back to Nepal every  year
         and spends about a month there. It is clear  that  the  appellant's
         mother keeps in touch  with  her  family  in  Nepal  including  the
         appellant. I conclude that  the  visits  are  not  solely  for  the
         appellant. The evidence does not show a real  emotional  dependency
         between the appellant and  his  mother  as  opposed  to  the  usual
         emotional ties that one would expect. The appellant's brother  Khem
         was living in the UK with his mother but it is stated that  he  has
         now left and gone to the USA. The appellant's mother left Nepal  in
         2013. An application was not made for the appellant to come to  the
         UK until 2017, some four years later. The appellant was aged 25  in
         2013 and was 29 years of age in 2017. He is now 30.

         I find that although the appellant has not  formed  an  independent
         family unit of his own in the sense that he has a  partner  or  any
         children, he lives independently on  a  farm.  I  acknowledge  that
         there has been no real challenge to the core  facts  in  this  case
         apart from the appellant's  claimed  dependency  and  the  lack  of
         proper evidence to support such claimed dependency.

         I do not find that article 8 is engaged in the family  life  sense.
         The relationship between the appellant and his mother  is  part  of
         his private life.'



Appeal

11. The grounds complain firstly as to an error of fact that establishes an
    error of law, namely that the Judge erred in adversely relying upon the
    lack of bank statements produced when assessing the  receipt  of  money
    transfers because the means of transfer required no payment into a bank
    account, contrary to the finding of the Judge.

12. Secondly, it is  asserted  that  the  Judge  failed  to  take  material
    evidence into  consideration  when  observing  a  withdrawal  from  the
    Sponsor's account in Nepal by failing to assess her  evidence  on  this
    issue as addressed by her witness statement.

13. The third ground is a complaint that the  Judge  erred  in  determining
    that if the appellant receives support from other  family  members,  he
    cannot also be financially dependent upon his mother.  It  is  asserted
    that real, committed and/or effective support does not  mean  exclusive
    support.

14. A fourth ground asserts that family life for the purposes of article  8
    can be engaged through either emotional  or  financial  dependency  and
    both are not required to exist in unison.

15. In granting permission to appeal DJUT Mailer observed:

         'It is arguable that article 8 may have been engaged on  the  basis
         of financial dependency. There was no finding  that  the  appellant
         currently earn money from farming. It is  also  arguable  that  the
         Judge may have erred in assessing financial dependency by  assuming
         at [36] that the appellant needed to have a bank account to receive
         money from his sponsor.'



Decision on an error of law

16. Upon inspecting the money transfer receipts filed with the Tribunal Mr.
    Walker accepted that the Judge had erred in fact as  to  the  available
    means by which the appellant could secure the remitted  funds.  Several
    of the receipts clearly state that payment to the  recipient  in  Nepal
    was in cash, rather than by way of bank transfer. He  further  accepted
    that such an error adversely affected the Judge's consideration at [36]
    of his decision in respect of the issue of  financial  dependency.  The
    transfers evidenced by the money transfer receipts cover the period  of
    February 2015 to March 2018 and the sums remitted amount to some  �2200
    over a three-year period. Upon careful consideration I accept that such
    error of fact  cannot  be  separated  from  the  rest  of  the  Judge's
    reasoning in the relevant paragraph  and  that  the  mistake  as  to  a
    material fact was perverse and so amounts to a material error of law: R
    (Iran) v. Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2005]  EWCA  Civ
    982.

17. Having so found in relation to the first ground of  appeal,  I  am  not
    required to consider the remaining grounds.

18. Both representatives confirmed that if I were to find a material  error
    of law and so allowed the appeal against the decision of JFtT  Burnett,
    I could proceed to remake the decision on the evidence presently before
    me without the need for a further hearing.



Remaking the decision

19. The appellant, an adult male, is required to establish for the purposes
    of this appeal that he is a dependent relative and so he  is  therefore
    required to establish that he enjoys a family life  with  his  sponsor,
    his mother. This can be  by  way  of  financial  dependency,  emotional
    dependency or both.

20. As accepted by Mr. Balroop before me,  the  appellant  is  required  to
    establish the existence of a family life before proportionality  is  to
    be considered, and so any consideration  of  'historic  injustice'  can
    only be assessed and weighed once the initial hurdle has been crossed.

21. Firstly, considering financial dependency, I  observe  the  appellant's
    evidence  that  he  works  for  others  on  farms  in   Nepal   without
    renumeration. His explanation is: 'I  spend  my  time  working  in  the
    fields. It is not for gain. It just keeps me  away  from  other  things
    while my focus remains on my life with my mother in the UK.' It is  the
    appellant's case that he is unable to financially survive  without  the
    aid of his mother and his siblings.  I further  observe  the  sponsor's
    evidence that the family farm is a small piece of land on  which  crops
    are grown and that it was insufficient to feed a family of  two  adults
    and eight children. The  appellant's  father  was  able  to  find  paid
    employment working in fields belonging to  other  people  in  order  to
    supplement the family income. I note that the  family  resided  in  the
    family home throughout the lifetime of the appellant and members of the
    family have over such time left the property. As the  sponsor  confirms
    in her witness statement, 'one after the  other  the  elder  (children)
    started to stand up on their own feet and as soon  as  they  did  that,
    they would leave our house to live on  their  own.  My  daughters  were
    married off and they started living with their own  families.'  By  the
    time the sponsor travelled to this country she was living only with the
    appellant, and he now lives in the family home on  his  own.  The  land
    owned by the family is therefore only required to sustain the appellant
    and not a family of 10. Being mindful that the burden  rests  upon  the
    appellant to establish his case I do not accept that in the  straitened
    circumstances as presented to me by the appellant  he  would  work  for
    free, simply to pass time. The sponsor  asserted  before  JFtT  Burnett
    that the appellant is expected to repay his siblings for the money they
    have loaned to him. The appellant has failed to provide any explanation
    as to why, if he requires support from a number of family  members,  he
    would not seek paid employment but simply work for free to keep himself
    occupied. I find that the appellant is untruthful on this issue. He  is
    seeking to create an illusion that he is financially dependent upon the
    sponsor and his siblings. I find to the requisite standard that he  has
    access to family-owned land upon which he can grow crops  for  his  own
    consumption and that he works on the land of others, like  his  father,
    for  renumeration,  just  as  his  father  did.  Such  renumeration  is
    sufficient to permit the appellant to meet  his  day-to-day  needs,  in
    addition to the produce he receives from his own land.

22. I accept that some money is being sent from the United Kingdom  to  the
    appellant in Nepal. However, the fact that an  appellant  is  dependent
    upon  a  sponsor  for  subsistence  is  highly  material  but  is   not
    determinative  as  to  the  existence  of  family  life.   As   several
    authorities confirm, a bare  financial  dependency  between  one  adult
    party and another will not suffice: Patel v. Entry  Clearance  Officer,
    Mumbai [2010] EWCA Civ 17, at [28]

23. The appellant baldly contends in his witness  statement  that  'without
    [the sponsor's] support, I cannot live in Nepal' and  'I  will  not  be
    able to afford food, or place to live without my mother's support.'  He
    provides no  further  evidence  as  to  the  nature  of  his  financial
    dependency, his statement primarily addressing emotional dependency. It
    is not explained as to why he cannot afford a place to live without the
    financial support of his mother  when  he  is  residing  at  the  long-
    standing family home. By way of her statement the sponsor confirms that
    she regularly sends about �100 a month to the appellant in Nepal via  a
    local jeweller,  who  does  not  provide  her  with  a  record  of  the
    transaction. I note at this instance that the money  transfer  receipts
    filed with the Tribunal do not evidence monthly  remittances  and  that
    the receipts detail the means of remitting money as being via the  Post
    Office, MoneyGram and RIA. I observe that the Post Office used  by  the
    sponsor is local to her in Plumstead and she has been  willing  to  use
    its services for a small fee. Being mindful of the relevant standard of
    proof I accept that the sponsor has sent in the region of �2200 to  the
    appellant over a period of three  years,  but  I  do  not  accept  that
    further remittances are also sent through a local jeweller who does not
    provide a receipt of such  transactions,  in  circumstances  where  the
    sponsor avails herself of several other means of sending remittances to
    her son.

24. The sponsor further states that when she  visits  the  appellant  every
    year, she withdraws money from her pension account and that such  money
    is spent 'together' with the  appellant.  A  striking  aspect  of  this
    appeal is that Khem confirms by way of his witness  statement  that  at
    the relevant time his mother lived with him and he was employed earning
    approximately �2100  net  a  month.  The  Barclays  bank  statement  in
    relation to the sponsor's bank account confirms  that  she  receives  a
    pension in the region of �109 per week. Her outgoings are very limited.
    Her bank statements evidence that she was spending between �12-  �20  a
    week at Tesco and some �50  a  month  for  her  mobile  phone  bill.  I
    observed to  Mr.  Balroop  at  the  hearing  that  the  evidence,  when
    considered as a whole, is  such  as  to  strongly  establish  that  the
    sponsor was in reality financially reliant upon her son Khem throughout
    the relevant period when remittances were being sent to  the  appellant
    in Nepal. I  observe  the  appellant's  own  evidence  in  his  witness
    statement that Khem supports his mother. She  was  receiving  a  little
    over �5000 a year by way of her pension  in  this  country.  All  other
    needs, such as her accommodation, were being met by Khem. I  find  that
    the sponsor's ability to remit money to  the  appellant  and  give  him
    money from her Nepalese pension was solely  predicated  upon  the  fact
    that she herself was financially supported by a  son  present  in  this
    country.

25. In such circumstances, and being mindful of the requisite  standard,  I
    do not accept that the  appellant  is  truthful  as  to  his  financial
    situation and I do not accept that he is financially dependent upon the
    sponsor.

26. As to emotional dependency, the Court of Appeal accepted  in  Secretary
    of State for the Home Department v. Onuorah [2017] EWCA  Civ  1757  the
    guidance given by the European Court of Human Rights  in  S  v.  United
    Kingdom (application no. 10375/83) (unreported) that the protection  of
    family life under article 8 generally involves  cohabiting  dependents,
    such as parents and  their  dependent,  minor  children.  Relationships
    between adults will not necessarily acquire the protection of article 8
    without evidence of further elements of dependency, involving more than
    the normal  emotional  ties.  The  Court  has  regularly  adopted  this
    position: Kugathas v. Secretary of State for the Home Department [2003]
    EWCA Civ 31; [2003] INLR 170, R (on the  application  of  Britcits)  v.
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2017] EWCA Civ 368;  [2017]
    1 WLR 3345 and Entry Clearance Officer, Sierra Leone  v.  Kopol  [2017]
    EWCA Civ 1511; [2018] Imm AR 330.

27. The litmus test remains whether the  relationship  displays  more  than
    normal emotional ties. Lindblom LJ (with whom Beatson and Henderson LJJ
    agreed) emphasised the importance of  establishing  whether  there  was
    'real,  committed  or  effective  support'  passing  from  sponsor   to
    appellant: Jitendra Rai v. Entry Clearance Officer (New  Delhi)  [2017]
    EWCA Civ 320, at [36].

28. I observe that the grounds of appeal  did  not  specifically  challenge
    JFtT Burnett's findings as to there being no  emotional  dependency  of
    the nature required to establish a family  life  for  the  purposes  of
    article 8. However, I have considered the evidence relied  upon  before
    me. The appellant lives in  the  family  home  and  continues  to  have
    regular contact with all of his family members, not just  the  sponsor.
    As I have found above the appellant is able to farm his  own  land  and
    work for financial reward on the land of others. He  has  a  number  of
    family members living near him. Further, when  his  mother  returns  to
    Nepal it is not only to see him but also to see other  members  of  her
    family. The appellant is now a man aged 30  who  leads  an  independent
    life. The circumstances  arising  in  this  appeal  come  nowhere  near
    establishing the level of dependency required to establish family  life
    between adult family members.



Conclusion

29. Having found that the appellant is neither financially nor  emotionally
    dependent upon the sponsor I find to the  required  standard  that  the
    sponsor does not provide  the  appellant  with  real  or  committed  or
    effective support and that no family life exists in this matter  giving
    rise to the existence  of  protected  rights  under  article  8.  I  am
    therefore not required to proceed to consider whether the  respondent's
    decision is a proportionate one  for  the  purposes  of  article  8.  I
    therefore find that the respondent's decision is a lawful one.



Notice of decision

30. The Judge erred materially in law for the  reasons  identified.  I  set
    aside the Judge's decision promulgated on 1 November 2018  pursuant  to
    section 12(2)(a) of the Tribunal, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007.

31. I remake the decision by dismissing the appellant's appeal.

32. Having dismissed the appeal, I make no fee award.
