Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms J Bond, instructed by Irving & Co Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr T Lindsay, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is the remaking of the decision on the appellant's appeal  against
    the respondent's decision of 29 March  2018  to  deport  him  from  the
    United Kingdom.  Following a hearing before Mr Justice Dove sitting  as
    an Upper Tribunal Judge and  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Allen  an  earlier
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal was set aside and  the  matter  was
    relisted for remaking of the decision.

2.   It does not appear that directions were issued with regard  to  further
    evidence, but Mr Lindsay was not put in any difficulty by  the  further
    evidence provided and therefore it  was  possible  to  proceed.   I  am
    grateful to him for his cooperation in this regard.

3.   The appellant gave evidence, having  signed  his  most  recent  witness
    statement.  He lives with his partner [MA] and his stepson and they had
    been living there for four years now.  He had accepted the contents  of
    his earlier witness statement previously and still wished  to  rely  on
    it.  He also relied on the updated statement.   There  were  additional
    medical records in the  new  bundle.   He  had  suffered  from  alcohol
    dependence from 2004.  In 2012 he was treated  for  psychosis  and  his
    medication was increased.  He was currently taking medication for  high
    blood pressure and for psychosis.  From 2013 onwards he had had ongoing
    reviews with regard to his mental health.  He had not been particularly
    receptive, as the evidence said, and he had been seen by a psychiatrist
    every three weeks and had said that it would  not  be  really  good  to
    refer him to a mental health hospital.  He had his family and his home.



4.   There was the reference of 21 May 2013 to him looking for  a  job.   He
    had always worked previously on and off.  He had worked for most of the
    time.  A letter of 19 January referred  to  him  saying  there  was  no
    evidence of auditory hallucinations but he  still  had  voices  in  his
    head.  The letter of 11 April 2019 confirmed the medication and it  was
    the same now.

5.   With regard to the correspondence concerning  his  stepson,  the  child
    saw his father sometimes.  His own relationship with the child was very
    good, they bonded with each other and did everything  with  each  other
    and had done so for four years.  During that time the  child  had  been
    unwell and had missed school sometimes because of his illness.  He  had
    been diagnosed with ulcerative colitis from the age of 2.  Once he  had
    been in hospital for nearly two weeks.

6.   In cross-examination  the  appellant  said  that  his  partner  was  of
    Portuguese nationality.  As to whether the child was also Portuguese he
    said no, he had been born in the United Kingdom.  As to whether he  had
    any evidence that the child was not Portuguese but British  he  thought
    he could get the birth certificate.  The child did not have  a  British
    passport but had a Portuguese passport.

7.   He was asked whether there was any  reason  why  his  partner  and  the
    child could not move to Portugal with him and he said they would not as
    they lived here and were very close to the school here  and  she  would
    not take him out of school to go to Portugal.  They had discussed that,
    and his partner had said that she was not going to  Portugal.   He  was
    asked whether other than not wanting to, was  there  anything  stopping
    her, any problems for her and the child, and he said he thought so  and
    she had told him she would not go and her mother lived here.

8.   He was referred to the letter from  the  doctor  at  page  204  of  the
    bundle and the reference to him buying medication on the internet.   He
    said yes it was cheaper and  he  could  not  afford  to  buy  from  the
    chemist.  He was asked whether he had evidence of a doctor telling  him
    he needed to take those medications and he said yes he thought  it  was
    in the bundle.  It was put to him that if he did need to  take  it,  it
    would be available in Portugal and he said he did not know and  he  had
    not been there for 26 years and had no family in  Portugal.   They  all
    lived here in London.  He was asked how well he spoke Portuguese and he
    said a little but not much.  They spoke  Portuguese  a  little  bit  at
    home.  It was put to him that there was no reason that he would not  be
    able to live in Portugal and find work within a reasonable time and  he
    said he had no-one there and if he went there he would be homeless  and
    would not be able to start a life there.  All his family was in  London
    and he did not know how he would start a life there.

9.   He was asked whether he had checked as to whether he would be  able  to
    obtain state benefits in Portugal and he said that state  benefits  did
    not exist in Portugal.  It was put to him that  he  would  be  able  to
    support himself or have state benefits and he said he did not think so.
     He did not have a place to start a life in Portugal and he would  live
    on the streets.  He had not been involved in crime for  quite  a  while
    and had been trying to go straight.  It was put to him that in the view
    of the Home Office he would keep  committing  offences  in  the  United
    Kingdom and he said no he had stopped for a  long  time  now.   He  was
    trying to have a job.

10.  There was no re-examination.

11.  The next witness was [MA] who continued to rely  on  her  statement  of
    2019 and also adopted her most recent witness statement of  2020.   The
    contents were all true.  As regards the evidence of her  son's  medical
    condition and the impact on him he could have a normal life  unless  he
    had flare ups and that might involve him going to hospital  for  a  day
    and up to a month.  He had to be very careful with his diet  and  could
    not get very stressed.

12.  If the appellant lost his appeal she would  not  go  to  Portugal  with
    him.  She had everything here, having established a life here with  her
    son being born here and her job was here.  It would  be  very  hard  to
    take him to start a new life.  It would be very difficult  for  him  to
    leave the appellant but she  had  no  resources  in  Portugal.   As  to
    whether there were social welfare benefits in Portugal she did not know
    how it worked.  The immediate family life of the appellant was  in  the
    United Kingdom, where his parents and  siblings  were.   The  appellant
    took medication on a regular basis, for schizophrenia  and  high  blood
    pressure.  She had been to one of his medical appointments,  last  year
    around July to September.  That  had  been  before  one  of  the  court
    hearings.  The appellant got his medication via the GP on prescription.



13.  When she had found out he had health issues after he had  come  out  of
    jail and they had one of the hearings he had told the solicitor he  had
    a problem.  She had known him since 2003 and had met his family.  If he
    had to go back to Portugal with regard to support and  benefits  and  a
    job she did not know how it worked in Portugal and  she  would  not  be
    able to help him financially there, she was struggling now,  there  had
    been a lot of court hearings and she did not have a lot of savings  and
    now had none.

14.  On  cross-examination  the  witness  was  asked  whether  her  son  was
    Portuguese and said he had Portuguese nationality but had been born  in
    the United Kingdom and had always lived here.  As regards support  from
    her or the appellant's family she was asked whether she could not  send
    him some money immediately on return and she said she had no  money  to
    help him if he went back.  She had no savings.  They  had  been  paying
    the solicitors.

15.  There was no re-examination.

16.  In his submissions Mr Lindsay relied on and expanded on the  points  in
    the refusal letter.  There might still be an issue about the  level  of
    protection for the appellant.  In the refusal letter it was argued that
    even if he had the right of  permanent  residence  there  were  serious
    grounds of public policy  justifying  his  expulsion  from  the  United
    Kingdom.  This was relevant to both  levels.   Quite  clearly,  it  was
    argued, no right of residence had been acquired by the  appellant.   It
    was established law that a period in prison  broke  continuity  as  had
    been held in Onuekwere C-378/12, as referred to in  the  error  of  law
    decision.  It could be seen from the HMRC  records  in  the  bundle  at
    pages 18 to 21 that there was not a  continuous  period.   He  had  had
    periods in prison as could be seen as set out in  the  refusal  letter.
    There was a period in 2014 to 2015 where no employment was recorded but
    he received credits.  Quite clearly in accordance with Regulation 6  of
    the EEA Regulations concerning him as a qualified person, status  as  a
    jobseeker or a worker who had ceased to work, this only lasted for  six
    months so that would not suffice given the history of his time  in  the
    United Kingdom, to enable him to have five continuous  years.   It  was
    therefore quite plain that he had not acquired any rights of  permanent
    residence.  As a consequence he was only entitled to the  lowest  level
    of protection.

17.  The higher level required a permanent right of residence  and  if  that
    was not shown then it was the lowest level only.   The  refusal  letter
    set out the level of threat that existed, so expulsion  was  justified.
    Reference was made to paragraph  5  of  that  decision  letter  to  his
    criminal  history  over  a  twenty  year  period   including   fourteen
    convictions and a number of serious offences over a substantial  period
    of time.  He was therefore a  persistent  offender  with  a  number  of
    convictions and sentences including imprisonment.  There  was  a  clear
    likelihood that he would continue to offend.  At all  times  since  his
    most  recent  conviction  he  had  been  subject  to  the   threat   of
    deportation, so he had not shown that he would not offend without  such
    a threat hanging over him.  The test under  the  Regulations  was  made
    out.

18.  Paragraph  24  of  the  refusal  letter  referred  to  the  appellant's
    behaviour and paragraph 26 noted  the  deliberate  breach  of  a  court
    order, which was relevant to the risk of reoffending.  Paragraph 27 set
    out the index offence and that was relevant to the threat  his  actions
    posed and the likely ongoing risk.  Paragraph 29 referred to the  drugs
    elements and paragraph 30  summarised  the  effect  of  his  conviction
    history and was a proper and accurate assessment of his attitude to the
    criminal justice system.  He had a lack of regard for the law and posed
    a present threat.  As  a  consequence  the  threat  was  made  out  and
    deportation was justified.

19.  As  regards  proportionality,  this  was  addressed  at  paragraphs  36
    onwards in the decision letter.  He was a Portuguese national who could
    seek help, as set out at paragraph 39.  This had been  in  issue  since
    2018, but his evidence was not that he had tried and been unable to re-
    establish connections in  Portugal,  for  example  via  his  Portuguese
    family in the United Kingdom.  It was not said now that  the  appellant
    had contacts in Portugal who could help, nor anything about efforts  to
    find out about help from charitable organisations.   Nor  had  it  been
    shown that any proper efforts had been made to show the possibility  of
    state assistance had been investigated.  It would be surprising  if  it
    were not, as Portugal was an EU member state.  It had to be shown  that
    it was true if he claimed to be destitute on return.   He  could  still
    speak Portuguese including speaking it at home so language would be  no
    barrier to integration.

20.  As regards rehabilitation, reference was made to the skeleton  argument
    Ms Bond had put  in  at  the  previous  hearing.   In  the  absence  of
    integration and a  permanent  right  of  residence  rehabilitation  was
    unlikely to carry significant weight.  There were no strong reasons  as
    to why his partner and stepson could not relocate  to  Portugal.   Both
    were Portuguese nationals.  Even the  most  recent  witness  statements
    were silent on this.  Put at its highest the  reasons  were  preference
    rather than anything strong in the proportionality evaluation.

21.  As regards the appellant's partner's son, it was  not  argued  that  he
    had family life with him, as the child had a father who played  a  role
    in his life including attending appointments.  The appellant considered
    the relationship to be close.  If the Tribunal agreed that he  posed  a
    threat to the interests of the United Kingdom that was a  very  weighty
    matter in regard to the proportionality evaluation.  It outweighed  the
    issue of the child's best interests or other rights.

22.  As regards the child's illness and stress there would be stress if  the
    appellant was deported, but during the four years of  the  relationship
    the appellant had been in prison and if it would be stressful  for  the
    child for him to be deported, prison would be also.   If  the  Tribunal
    agreed about ongoing future risk including prison, then clearly in  any
    event this would be an additional source of stress to the child.  Taken
    altogether the difficulties for the child were not  strong  matters  in
    the proportionality assessment.  The appellant could work on return and
    the Tribunal had not been told that he  could  not  get  the  necessary
    medication in Portugal, treatment and  medication.   The  decision  was
    therefore proportionate.

23.  As regards Article 8, he was a persistent offender so section  117D  of
    the 2002 Act applied.  He was a  foreign  criminal,  and  none  of  the
    exceptions to deportation were open to him on the  facts  or  evidence.
    The submissions made earlier were  adopted  in  the  context  of  undue
    harshness.  It would not be unduly harsh for the appellant's stepson if
    the relationship was engaged, for the purposes of the  exceptions.   It
    would  not  be  disproportionate.   There  were  not  very  significant
    obstacles to the appellant's integration into Portugal.  There  was  no
    likelihood of destitution.  Within a reasonable time he would  be  able
    to establish  a  private  life  on  return  and  there  were  not  very
    compelling circumstances also.

24.  In her submissions Ms Bond relied  on  the  earlier  skeleton  argument
    with regard to the legal framework.  It was not  accepted  that  prison
    broke integration.  There was an important distinction as  set  out  in
    cases such as Vomero.  It was a question of  whether  you  could  count
    periods of custody for the purpose of the ten year period and that  had
    not been decided and it was unclear what the  impact  of  a  period  of
    imprisonment was, but it was clear that the clock reset to zero  during
    the five year period  with  regard  to  the  issue  of  acquisition  of
    permanent  residence.   It  was  argued  that  there  were  very  short
    sentences, there was a five year work history and it would be troubling
    if the clock reset to zero after each period,  but  in  Hussein  [2020]
    EWCA Civ 156 the Court of Appeal had said that that was the case.   The
    matter was not formally conceded.  It was argued that between 2007  and
    2012 the appellant acquired permanent residence.  There  was  a  unique
    feature in that the appellant's offending history was  because  of  his
    mental health condition.  Psychosis had  been  diagnosed  in  2011  and
    before then he had alcohol and drug  problems.   It  was  incorrect  to
    preclude someone who could not show a full five years' work history  on
    the basis that they had a mental health condition.  This had an  impact
    on ability to work and to show continuous residence.  Other cases  were
    similar when the Secretary of State  had  taken  a  holistic  view  and
    decided it was not right to deport the person.

25.  The Secretary of State had been unaware when she had decided to  deport
    the appellant that he had mental health difficulties.   This  mitigated
    the effects of his offending behaviour.  It should  not  be  sought  to
    deport him on that basis.  It was clear that he had  been  experiencing
    ongoing therapeutic treatment back to 2012 and page 199 of  the  bundle
    referred to 2013.  The Secretary of State  had  been  unaware  of  this
    background to the offending behaviour as it had come in late in the day
    and it was not a new development in the case and partly  explained  the
    appellant's offending behaviour and was relevant to proportionality.

26.  The letter of 11 April 2019 at page 204 of  the  bundle  was  the  most
    recent medical evidence.  The  appellant's  partner  confirmed  he  was
    seeing a GP and getting prescriptions.  There was no evidence about the
    child's father's nationality but it was clear that he had a  Portuguese
    passport and ID so he was to be treated as Portuguese.  But  the  child
    had been born in the United Kingdom and lived here thereafter and  that
    was very significant for the appeal.  He was  now  nearly  13  and  was
    likely to be very strongly integrated into the United Kingdom.

27.  There was  now  evidence  of  the  appellant's  relationship  with  his
    stepson including a letter from the child.  It was  not  accepted  that
    there was not family life.  It could be seen from  the  child's  letter
    that he saw the appellant as a father figure.  The child's  mother  had
    explained that they had not told him about what had happened  when  the
    appellant went to prison but had said that he was working abroad so  it
    did not have the same impact on him as removal to Portugal  would.   It
    was necessary to take account of  the  appellant's  and  his  partner's
    views of the huge impact there would be on the child if he were removed
    and there would be impact on  the  appellant  also,  given  his  health
    problems.  With regard to his partner her evidence was quite clear that
    her life and her son's life was in the United Kingdom and she could not
    afford to relocate or to help  the  appellant,  and  the  child  had  a
    relationship with his father also  and  that  was  a  very  significant
    feature of the case and relevant to proportionality.

28.  The appellant and his partner were both employed and his partner had  a
    good job and did shifts and relied on the appellant for  help  and  his
    working pattern enabled him to do that.  The child would  lose  one  of
    his primary carers.  Also in the bundle there was confirmation that all
    of the appellant's immediate family lived in the United Kingdom and  he
    had no current connections in Portugal.  He had been born in Mozambique
    not Portugal.  His time in custody was a total of fourteen months  over
    a sixteen year period and his mental health problems explained that  at
    least in part.  He had almost completed five years' work history albeit
    there were short periods of  custody  during  that  period.   Whichever
    standard was applied it was a  singular  case.   A  present  threat  to
    public  security  had  not  been   shown.    The   decision   was   not
    proportionate.

29.  I reserved my decision.

30.  The details  of  the  appellant's  criminal  history  are  set  out  at
    paragraphs 5 to 8 of the decision letter.  He  received  a  conditional
    discharge for theft - shoplifting on 27 July  1998.   Between  28  July
    1998 and 3  January  2018  he  received  fourteen  convictions  for  24
    offences in the United Kingdom, including fraudulent use of  a  vehicle
    licence, possession of a controlled drug of class B (cannabis), failing
    to surrender to custody at the appointed time, driving a motor  vehicle
    with excess alcohol,  driving  whilst  disqualified,  using  a  vehicle
    whilst uninsured, possessing a controlled drug with intent  to  supply,
    possessing a controlled drug  of  class  A  (MDMA),  use  of  uninsured
    vehicle, possessing  or  controlling  article  for  use  in  fraud  and
    possessing and controlling identity documents with intent.  He received
    various fines, community punishment orders and suspended sentences  and
    various sentences of imprisonment.  Particular reference  was  made  to
    his conviction on 3 January 2018, the most recent offence, of  using  a
    vehicle  whilst  uninsured  and  possessing  or  controlling   identity
    documents with intent.  He was sentenced to eight months' imprisonment.
     He has also received three cautions for offences, 3  August  1998  for
    theft - shoplifting, a similar offence on 5 June 1999, on  23  February
    2002 for possessing a class A controlled drug - MDMA.  It is, I  think,
    common ground that the total amount of time spent by the  appellant  in
    prison is fourteen months.

31.  Under Regulation 23(6)(b) of the Immigration (European  Economic  Area)
    Regulations 2016 ("the EEA Regulations 2016"), the Secretary  of  State
    may deport an EEA national  where  it  is  decided  that  the  person's
    removal is justified on the grounds of public policy,  public  security
    or public  health.   Any  such  deportations  are  required  to  be  in
    accordance with Regulation 27 of the EEA Regulations, which states that
    an EEA national who has a right of permanent residence  in  the  United
    Kingdom may only be deported on serious grounds  of  public  policy  or
    public security and that an EEA national who has resided in the  United
    Kingdom for a continuous period of at least  ten  years  prior  to  the
    deportation decision may only be  deported  on  imperative  grounds  of
    public security.

32.  Under Regulation 15 of  the  EEA  Regulations  2016,  an  EEA  national
    acquires the right of permanent residence if they have resided  in  the
    United Kingdom in accordance  with  the  EEA  Regulations  2016  for  a
    continuous period of five years.  It is clear from Regulation 3(3) that
    time spent in prison does not constitute residence for the  purpose  of
    the 2016 Regulations.

33.  The appellant claims to have arrived in the  United  Kingdom  in  1994.
    He was issued with an EEA residence permit on 23  April  2002  and  was
    later issued  with  an  EEA  national  registration  certificate  on  8
    February 2008.  The decision maker noted that it was accepted  that  at
    the time when the appellant was issued with the EEA residence permit in
    2002 he provided evidence to show he was in employment but there was no
    evidence as to how long that  employment  continued.   He  subsequently
    applied for a document certifying that  he  had  acquired  a  permanent
    right of residence, on 15 March 2007, and  produced  a  letter  showing
    employment between 4 April and 26 November of that year.   In  view  of
    the limited  evidence  provided  he  was  issued  with  a  further  EEA
    registration certificate as he had not provided evidence  that  he  had
    acquired a permanent right to reside.

34.  The appellant has  provided  evidence  relating  to  employment.   This
    shows that for the year 2007-08 he earned �6,025, for the year  2008-09
    a total of nearly �24,000, for the year 2009-10 �18,000, for  the  year
    2010-11 �20,000 and for the year 2011-12 �163.  In the subsequent  year
    he showed  earnings  of  over  �6,300  and  in  2013-14  over  �20,000.
    Subsequently he was in receipt of employment  support  credits  and  no
    employers were recorded.

35.  This is of relevance to the question of  whether  he  was  entitled  to
    enhanced protection under Regulation 27(4) of the 2016 Regulations.  On
    this evidence I do not consider that he has shown that he  has  resided
    in the  United  Kingdom  in  accordance  with  the  Regulations  for  a
    continuous period of five years.  His employment record does  not  show
    that he was a worker for a continuous period of five years, bearing  in
    mind the very low earnings in 2011-12.  As the decision letter  states,
    the evidence prior to then was thin.  The subsequent evidence does  not
    show that he satisfied  the  requirements  of  Regulation  5  which  is
    concerned  with  workers  or  self-employed  persons  who  have  ceased
    activity or that the period after 2013-14 when he  was  in  receipt  of
    employment and support credits could enable him to satisfy the criteria
    of being a qualified person under Regulation 6.

36.  In addition there is the point to which we adverted  in  the  error  of
    law decision with regard to the appellant's  periods  of  imprisonment.
    It is clear, as noted above,  that  Regulation  3(3)(a)  provides  that
    continuity of residence is broken when a person serves  a  sentence  of
    imprisonment.  It is clear from what was said by the Court  of  Justice
    in Onuekwere that periods of imprisonment cannot count  when  assessing
    whether a person has qualified for a permanent right  of  residence  by
    demonstrating a five year continuous period of residence as a qualified
    person.  The various periods of imprisonment which the appellant served
    are properly to be taken as breaking continuity  of  residence.   As  a
    consequence of my conclusions in this regard, the appellant is a person
    who is entitled only to the lowest level of protection under Regulation
    27.  The test therefore is one of public  policy,  public  security  or
    public health rather than serious grounds of public policy  and  public
    security as set out in Regulation 27(3) as he is not a  person  with  a
    right of permanent residence.

37.  It is clear from Regulation 27(5) that where  a  relevant  decision  is
    taken on grounds of public policy or public security it  must  also  be
    taken in accordance with the principles set out at subparagraphs (a) to
    (f) of Regulation 27(5).  That is to say:

         "(5)

             (a)   the  decision  must  comply  with   the   principle   of
                  proportionality;

             (b)  the decision must be based exclusively  on  the  personal
                  conduct of the person concerned;

             (c)  the personal conduct  of  the  person  must  represent  a
                  genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting
                  one of the fundamental interests of society,  taking  into
                  account past conduct of the person  and  that  the  threat
                  does not need to be imminent;

             (d)  matters isolated from the  particulars  of  the  case  or
                  which relate to considerations of  general  prevention  do
                  not justify the decision;

             (e)  a  person's  previous  criminal  convictions  do  not  in
                  themselves justify the decision;

             (f)  the decision may be taken on preventative  grounds,  even
                  in the absence of a previous criminal conviction, provided
                  the grounds are specific to the person.

         (6)  Before taking a relevant decision on  the  grounds  of  public
             policy and public security in relation to a person  ("P")  who
             is resident in the United Kingdom,  the  decision  maker  must
             take account of considerations  such  as  the  age,  state  of
             health, family and economic situation  of  P,  P's  length  of
             residence in the  United  Kingdom,  P's  social  and  cultural
             integration into the United Kingdom  and  the  extent  of  P's
             links with P's country of origin."

38.  I consider that it can properly be said that the  appellant's  personal
    conduct does represent  a  genuine,  present  and  sufficiently  threat
    affecting one of the fundamental interests of society  in  that  he  is
    properly to be regarded as a persistent offender, as can be  seen  from
    his history of offending up to and including the conviction of  January
    2018.  It is not a matter of taking into account purely and simply  the
    past history of convictions but the convictions are  indicative  of  an
    attitude to the law which are such and particularly bearing in mind the
    most recent conviction as to  demonstrate  that  the  level  of  threat
    identified at Regulation 27(5)(c) is met.  I agree  with  the  comments
    set out at paragraphs 24 to 31 of the decision letter which set out  in
    some detail why it is that the various  offences  are  significant  and
    indicative of the appellant's attitude to the laws of the land and  his
    willingness to depart from those laws.  I consider it has been properly
    shown that the evidence indicates that he has a propensity to  reoffend
    and the level of threat is such as to show that, as I say, the relevant
    criteria in the Regulations are made out.

39.  As regards the requirement that  the  decision  must  comply  with  the
    principle of proportionality, it is necessary to take  account  of  the
    factors in Regulation 27(6).  The appellant was born in  February  1978
    and is therefore now 42 years old.  Though the decision  maker  had  no
    evidence of adverse health problems, it  is  clear  from  the  evidence
    before me that the appellant has  in  fact  experienced  mental  health
    problems for a number of years, including,  as  is  summarised  in  the
    letter from Dr Hugh-Jones of 11 April 2019, that he was diagnosed  with
    alcohol dependence syndrome in around 2004, heroin  and  crack  cocaine
    misuse since about 2001, chronic paranoid psychosis since  about  2011,
    episode of severe depression with psychosis in 2016 and hypertension in
    2017.  His family situation is that he has been living with his partner
    for about four years and also living with them is  his  partner's  son.
    He clearly has a close relationship with both of them.  In addition  he
    has his mother and father and sisters in the United Kingdom and  indeed
    it seems from his evidence that he has no immediate family  members  in
    Portugal.  His wife is in steady employment and it  seems  that  he  is
    working now and that his work enables care to  be  maintained  for  the
    child who lives with them as his work fits in with his  partner's  work
    pattern.  As regards to the length of time he has been  in  the  United
    Kingdom it seems he has been here since 1994.  I accept his evidence in
    that regard.

40.  With regard to his links with his country of origin, according  to  his
    first statement he was born in Mozambique, moved to  Portugal  when  he
    was around 9 years old and lived there for some seven years,  including
    attendance at primary and secondary school, until 1994 when he moved to
    the United Kingdom.  He said in his witness statement  that  he  speaks
    Portuguese but cannot write in Portuguese fluently and would be  unable
    to find employment there.  His social and cultural integration into the
    United Kingdom has been severely disrupted by  his  criminal  offending
    and his periods of imprisonment.

41.  Regulation 27(8) requires the court  or  Tribunal  considering  whether
    the  requirements  of  this  Regulation  are  met  to  have  regard  in
    particular to the considerations  in  Schedule  1  to  the  Regulations
    (considerations of public policy, public security and  the  fundamental
    interests of society etc.).  There it is said at paragraph 3 that where
    an EEA national who is a persistent  offender  the  more  numerous  the
    convictions the greater the likelihood that his continued  presence  in
    the United Kingdom  represents  a  genuine,  present  and  sufficiently
    serious threat affecting the fundamental interests of society.  Also it
    is said that little weight is to  be  attached  (paragraph  4)  to  the
    integration of an EEA national within the United Kingdom if the alleged
    integrating links were formed  at  or  around  the  same  time  as  the
    commission of a criminal offence.  If such a person has been  shown  to
    have successfully reformed or rehabilitated then the  removal  is  less
    likely to be proportionate, under paragraph 5.

42.  At paragraph 7 of Schedule 1 there is a list of matters  which  are  to
    be included in the  fundamental  interests  of  society  which  include
    maintaining public order and tackling offences where there is  societal
    harm such as offences relating to the misuse of drugs.   Also  in  this
    list is the combating of the effects of persistent  offending.   Taking
    all  these  matters  together,  I  consider  that  the  decision  under
    challenge has been shown to be proportionate.  Although I bear in  mind
    the factors that favour the appellant such as his health  problems  and
    the close family links he  has,  his  degree  of  social  and  cultural
    integration into the United Kingdom is at best weak  given  the  extent
    and amount of his offending, and bearing in mind the considerations  in
    Schedule 1.  Clearly there will be an impact  on  his  stepson  of  his
    removal bearing in mind the closeness of the relationship they are said
    to have and also his stepson's health problems, and clearly also  there
    will be an impact on his partner.  She has made it clear that  she  and
    her son would not go to Portugal if the appellant were  to  be  removed
    there given the closeness of their connections to  the  United  Kingdom
    and to that must  be  added  the  fact  that  the  appellant's  stepson
    maintains a relationship with his father  and  clearly  that  would  be
    adversely affected were he to move to  Portugal.   Bringing  all  these
    matters together I consider that the decision is a proportionate one in
    accordance with the provisions of Regulation 27(5)(a)  and  bearing  in
    mind the other principles in subsection (5) also.  The EEA decision  is
    lawful.

43.  As regards the relevant Article 8 issues, the appellant  is  a  foreign
    criminal and therefore the Article  8  claim  has  to  include  in  its
    consideration the matters set out in section 117C of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

44.  As regards Exception 1, this will apply given  that  he  is  a  foreign
    criminal who has not been sentenced to a period of imprisonment of four
    years or more and is applicable as relevant in this case if he has been
    socially and culturally integrated in  the  United  Kingdom  and  there
    would be very significant obstacles to his integration into Portugal.

45.  As regards the former, I do not consider that it has  been  shown  that
    he is socially and  culturally  integrated  into  the  United  Kingdom,
    bearing in mind the significant criminal record of persistent offending
    to which I have referred above.  Although he has lived  in  the  United
    Kingdom for a good number  of  years,  his  criminal  conduct  is  such
    particularly bearing in  mind  the  most  recent  offence  in  2018  as
    indicative of an ongoing lack of integration into the  United  Kingdom,
    to satisfy the requirements of that provision.

46.   As  regards  the  latter,  although  there  would  be   obstacles   to
    integration into Portugal, he speaks Portuguese,  he  lived  there  for
    several years and has an employment history in the United Kingdom.   He
    appears to have been able to work for a number  of  years  despite  the
    mental health and other problems from  which  he  suffered  during  the
    times when he was in employment in the United Kingdom, and  although  I
    accept that his partner would be extremely financially stretched in his
    absence, he does have family members in the United Kingdom and  it  has
    not been shown that they could not assist him and nor has it been shown
    that he could not obtain assistance from the social security system  of
    Portugal which has not been shown not to exist.  There is  no  evidence
    to show that his health and other problems  could  not  be  effectively
    addressed in Portugal as they are in the United  Kingdom.   Accordingly
    the very significant obstacles criterion is not met.

47.  Exception 2 applies where he has a genuine and subsisting  relationship
    with  a  qualifying  partner  or  a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
    relationship with a qualifying child and the effect of his  deportation
    on either would be unduly harsh.

48.  Again I do not consider this criterion is  met.   The  undue  harshness
    test is a high one, as was made  clear  by  the  Supreme  Court  in  KO
    (Nigeria) [2018] UKSC 53.  There is reference  to  the  question  of  a
    level of harshness which goes  beyond  that  which  could  normally  be
    expected, and though I  accept  that  the  impact  on  the  appellant's
    partner would be problematic given the  support  he  provides  her  and
    their relationship, the harshness would not  extend  to  the  level  of
    undueness.  I also consider that this is the case with  regard  to  the
    impact on his relationship with his stepson.  I accept  that  they  are
    close and that there would be an adverse impact on the child but  that,
    as has been said, on high judicial authority, is what deportation does.
     It does damage family relationships and impacts adversely on  children
    and that can only be a matter of regret and sympathy.  But the test  is
    a high one and in my view it is not met in this case.

49.  Nor do I consider there are any factors that could  enable  this  claim
    to succeed under Article 8 outside the Rules.  The various points  that
    I have set out above are equally applicable in this context, and  there
    is nothing to show that the circumstances  are  such  as  to  enable  a
    successful claim under Article 8.  Accordingly this appeal is dismissed
    on all grounds.

No anonymity direction is made.
