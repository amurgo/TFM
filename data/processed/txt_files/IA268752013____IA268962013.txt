Representation:

For the Appellants:    Ms H Price, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr S Kandola, HOPO

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellants appeal with leave against the  determination  of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Braybrook in  which  she  dismissed  their  appeals
    against the decision of the respondent made on 24 June 2013  to  refuse
    the first appellant leave to remain as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant.  The
    second appellant is his wife and dependant.

2.   The first appellant made his application on 31 May 2013  for  leave  to
    remain as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant.  The respondent awarded no points
    on previous earnings.  The appellant had claimed �9,767  from  dividend
    vouchers and �7,953 from pay slips for KP Car  Park  Ltd  but  the  pay
    slips and dividend vouchers were not clearly shown as entering his bank
    account as per the statement  provided.   He  had  claimed  points  for
    earnings of �18,496 from World IT Services  Ltd  and  had  supplied  an
    accountant's letter, accounts and invoices as evidence of his earnings.
     The  respondent  stated  that  the  documentation  did  not  meet  the
    requirements of Appendix A of the Immigration Rules.

         "Because these are not appropriate documents in your  circumstances
         as you are an employee of your  own  company  so  therefore  cannot
         claim the turnover of the company.  This is a separate legal entity
         so  therefore  these  cannot  be  considered  your  funds  but  the
         companies funds".

3.   The judge said that the hearing on 24 December 2013  was  adjourned  to
    16 April 2014 because the  HOPO  below  had  amended  the  Reasons  for
    Refusal Letter to state that the  company  accounts  submitted  by  the
    appellants were false following oral evidence about  his  accounts  for
    World Services Ltd for the period ending 2013.  On 14  April  2014  the
    appellant lodged further documents.  They included HSBC Bank  statement
    for World IT Services showing a balance of �8,746 as at 13 April  2013.
    A letter dated 26 February 2014 from the company's accountants  Adamson
    & Co enclosed revised accounts for the company for the year to 12 April
    2013.  In a letter dated 26 February 2014, his accountant Mr Ahmad said



         "With regard to our client World IT Services Ltd we would  like  to
         explain regarding accounts prepared for period ending 12 April 2013
         that a clerical mistake was made while preparing accounts.  Cash of
         �7,988 were wrongly  debited  to  debtors  account.   Due  to  this
         debtors were wrongly shown that have now been rectified.   Cash  at
         bank and in hand now states correct reconciled balance  of  �9,246.
         The remaining �8,510 in other debtors relates to director's current
         account.  Sales figure remains  same  as  before  reported  in  the
         accounts of �20,400.  Please also note that  an  unpaid  cheque  of
         �2,650 on 18 January 2013 is not part of sales.  We have  corrected
         the accounts and relevant journal and ledgers are attached for your
         reference.  We have also prepared corrected accounts for your  kind
         consideration."

    The HOPO below acknowledged that this new evidence was admissible under
    Section 85A to enable  the  appellant  to  dispute  his  allegation  of
    forgery.

4.   The appellant gave oral evidence and acknowledged  in  effect  that  he
    had loaned himself �8,510 which he said he had taken  out  in  cash  in
    part payments.  The figure of �8,150 was included in a sum submitted by
    the appellant in his application for claimed earnings.  Mr Bryant,  the
    HOPO below submitted that these were not earnings but a loan  from  the
    company but the appellant stated he could repay the loan;  HMRC  states
    that if a loan is taken from a company it  can  be  returned  the  next
    year.  The appellant asserted that the director loan  account  was  his
    earnings.  He stated that according to HMRC a director's  loan  account
    can be repaid through salary or cash in account of dividends and he had
    opted for dividends.

5.   Mr. Briant submitted to the judge that the appellant's account of  what
    was permissible under HMRC  guidance  might  be  correct  but  for  the
    purposes of the application for PBS Tier 1, the applicant had  to  rely
    on past earnings.  The appellant was  using  a  figure  which  included
    future earnings but which Mr Bryant submitted  were  not  eligible  for
    inclusion.  The appellant needed �35,000  to  obtain  20  points.   The
    appellant accepted that the figure of �18,496 for World IT included  at
    page  25  of  his  application  included  �8,510  which  the  appellant
    acknowledged were advance  earnings.   If  the  figure  of  �8,510  was
    excluded the appellant would only obtain  5  points  for  the  previous
    earnings and would not meet the overall total of  80  points  required.
    The figure of �18,496  was  the  gross  profit  of  the  company.   The
    appellant was asserting that he was entitled to claim all the company's
    money as his but the appellant was not a sole trader but had opted  for
    limited liability; given that he had chosen this  protection  he  could
    not at the same time claim the company funds were all his.

6.   The appellant's representative Mr Abbas at the hearing below relied  on
    the Tier 1  guidance.   He  submitted  an  extract  from  the  guidance
    relevant to the applications made on or  after  1  October  2013.   The
    judge noted that neither representative was able to  access  or  submit
    the guidance relevant at the date of the application.  The guidance  in
    force as at 1 October 2013 states  that  "if  your  accounts  and  bank
    statements only show the gross amount of profit for  the  business  you
    should also provide a third piece of evidence showing the  next  profit
    of the business for the period claimed, for example a  corporation  tax
    return for an  accountant's  letter.   This  is  because  we  can  only
    consider the net profit of the business for your income".   Mr.  Briant
    submitted that he relied  on  the  Reasons  for  Refusal  Letter  which
    appeared to the judge to be applying different guidance.

7.   The judge found as follows:

         "11. Given the variations in the figures given by  the  accountants
             and the non compliance with the requirements for evidence from
             an accountant,  the  appellant  was  an  alternative  given  a
             further 14 days for the submission of corporation  tax  return
             showing the net profit of the business at the relevant period.
              The appellant indicated that such a  corporation  tax  return
             was available.  Mr Abbas also indicated that he  would  submit
             the guidance relevant at the date of application.  No  further
             documentation was submitted.


         12.  The burden of proof is on the appellant to establish  that  he
             meets the requirements of the rules relating to  Tier  1  Post
             study  work  Migrants  I   have   taken   into   account   the
             documentation application form in particular section  3  which
             required  details  of  the  supporting  evidence  of  previous
             earnings.  There had been considerable confusion on  the  part
             of the accountant.   I  am  not  on  the  evidence  before  me
             satisfied that the appellant can include in his calculation of
             previous earnings sums which he has  borrowed  in  respect  of
             future  earnings  and  he  has  not  therefore  achieved   the
             requisite number of points in relation to earnings."

8.   The grounds  of  appeal  argued  that  the  judge  gave  the  appellant
    fourteen days to submit further documentation.  The  documentation  was
    received by the Tribunal within that period but the  determination  did
    not take account  of  that  documentation.  The  First-tier  Judge  who
    granted permission said that the last day of the  fourteen  day  period
    was 30 April 2014.  There was documentary evidence that the  additional
    material  was  received  by  the  Tribunal  on  30  April  2014.    The
    determination indicates that  the  material  was  not  brought  to  the
    attention of the judge and her decision was  promulgated  on  30  April
    2014 i.e. before the expiry of the fourteen days.  This was arguably  a
    procedural defect which may amount to a material error of law.

9.   The respondent submitted a response in which  it  was  argued  that  it
    would appear that the judge was considering relying  on  evidence  that
    was not before the respondent in deciding a matter that  concerned  the
    award of points.  Such evidence is excluded by virtue of Section 85A of
    the 2002 Act.  It is not material whether the evidence was  before  the
    judge as it was not admissible.  Alternatively it was argued  that  the
    judge dismissed the appeal on the basis that the  appellant  could  not
    rely on borrowings from the company as amounting to earnings when  they
    clearly were not earnings.  It is  far  from  clear  how  the  accounts
    address this issue.  Therefore  the  respondent  did  not  accept  that
    material errors in law were disclosed.

10.  Counsel relied on two documents; the first was the CT 600  company  tax
    return form for World IT Services Ltd issued by  HMRC  for  the  period
    1/6/2012 to 31/5/2013.   It  shows  a  total  turnover  from  trade  of
    �20,400;  net  trading  and  professional  profits   of   �17,656   and
    corporation tax of �3,531.20.  The second was the UKBA Policy  Guidance
    on Tier 1 General for applications made on or after 6 April 2013.   The
    particular guidance Counsel relied on said this:

         "Self-Employed Earnings within a Business or Company Structure:


         If an applicant has worked in a self-employed capacity  in  his/her
         own business or company structure and has chosen  to  keep  his/her
         earnings within the business or company, he/she could provide:


           . Business or company accounts that meet statutory  requirements
             and show the net profit made for the earnings period  claimed;
             and

       . personal/business bank statements.

         If the applicant's accounts and bank statements only show the gross
         amount of profit for the business  he/she  should  also  provide  a
         third piece of evidence showing the net profit of the business  for
         the period claimed, for an example a corporation tax return  or  an
         accountant's letter.  This is because we can only consider the  net
         profit of the business for the applicant's income."

11.  Counsel submitted that the appellant  submitted  the  company  accounts
    and personal/business bank statements  which  meant  that  he  was  not
    required to produce a third piece  of  evidence  because  the  accounts
    showed both sets of profits.  The respondent was asking  the  appellant
    to produce a document that he was not required  to  produce  under  the
    policy guidance.  The judge  only  dismissed  the  appeal  because  the
    document was not before her even though it was pointed out to the judge
    how the appellant qualified under the Rules.  The policy document  that
    she was now referring to had already been alluded to by  Mr.  Ahmad  at
    the hearing.  It was not evidenced at the hearing and that was why  the
    judge asked for production of it.

12.  Mr Kandola submitted that the judge gave the appellant time to  produce
    evidence which was not admissible because the  evidence  was  submitted
    after the date of decision.  The CT tax form referred to by Counsel  is
    dated 22nd April 2014 and by virtue of Section 85A of the 2002 Act  the
    judge could not consider this piece of evidence.

13.  As regards the Policy Guidance, Mr Kandola  said  that  the  particular
    guidance Counsel sought to rely on  is  under  Self-Employed  earnings.
    The  appellant  is  not  self-employed.   He  is  the  director.    The
    director's report at page 63 states that the principal activity of  the
    company is providing IT support services.  The appellant cannot pray in
    aid the self-employed earnings within the guidance.   In  evidence  the
    appellant relied on the company's funds as his own funds and then  said
    that he had borrowed money  from  the  company  in  respect  of  future
    earnings.

14.  Counsel submitted that all this evidence was considered  by  the  judge
    and that was why she gave them permission to  submit  those  documents.
    In any event according  to  the  financial  statements  issued  by  his
    accountants for the  period  ending  12  April  2013,  the  company  is
    controlled by the appellant, the director, by virtue of his holding  of
    the company's 100% issued ordinary share  capital.   Counsel  submitted
    that as the  appellant  is  the  sole  director  of  the  company,  the
    company's money is his money.  The judge was convinced of this that was
    why she wanted evidence of the money the appellant could take from  the
    company.  The guidance which she referred to allows  him  to  show  net
    profits from the company.

15.  I find that the judge made a  procedural  error.   She  had  given  the
    parties fourteen days from 16 April 2004 to submit  a  corporation  tax
    return showing the net profit of the business at  the  relevant  period
    and the Policy Guidance which was in force  on 13 May 2013,   the  date
    the appellant made his application.  The 14  day  period  ended  on  30
    April 2014, which was the day  the  judge's  decision  was  signed  and
    promulgated.

16.  I find  that  the  policy  guidance  submitted  by  the  appellant  was
    admissible as it was going clarify the evidence  the  respondent  would
    consider when assessing the net profit of the business. I  accept  that
    the CT  tax  return  was  not  submitted  by  the  appellant  with  his
    application and therefore by virtue of Section 85A of the 2002 Act  was
    not admissible evidence which the judge could have considered.

17.  In any event I find that the documents would not have made  a  material
    difference to the judge's findings at paragraph 12.  I agree  with  the
    judge that there had been considerable confusion on  the  part  of  the
    accountant in respect of the appellant's  previous  earnings.   Whether
    the appellant is a sole director, shareholder or self employed  person,
    I agree with the  judge  that  the  appellant  cannot  include  in  his
    calculation of previous earnings sums which he has borrowed in  respect
    of future earnings.   I find on the evidence that the judge did not err
    in law.

18.  I find that the judge's  decision  dismissing  the  appellant's  appeal
    shall stand.
