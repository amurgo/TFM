                                   Between

                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                   Appellant


                                     and


                                     WG
                           (ANONYMITY ORDER MADE)
                                                                  Respondent

                    NOTICE OF ABANDONMENT UNDER RULE 17A

 1. The respondent, who was the appellant before  the  First-tier  Tribunal,
    brought an appeal under section 82 (1) of the  Nationality,  Immigration
    and Asylum Act  2002  ("the  2002  Act"),  which  was  successful.   The
    Secretary of State appealed against  that  decision  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal and in a decision issued on 9 September  2014,  Upper  Tribunal
    Judge Kopieczek, set aside the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  on
    the basis that it involved the making of an error of law.

 2. From information supplied by the Secretary of State, it appears that the
    respondent agreed voluntarily to return to  Jamaica,  and  was  deported
    there on 23 November 2014.

 3. Although  section  104  of  the   2002  Act  has  been  amended  by  the
    Immigration Act 2014 with effect from 20 October 2014  by  operation  of
    The  Immigration  Act  (Commencement  No.  3,  Transitional  and  Saving
    Provisions) Order 2014 ("the Order"), section 104 of the 2002 Act is one
    of the "saved provisions" as defined in article 1 (e) of that order  and
    so by operation of article 9 of the Order, continues to have  effect  as
    the respondent is not a person who falls within either article 10 or  11
    of the Order.

 4. I am therefore satisfied that as the  respondent  has  left  the  United
    Kingdom, the appeal is to be treated as abandoned  pursuant  to  section
    104 (4) of the 2002 Act and that the Upper Tribunal must therefore issue
    a notice pursuant to rule 17 A (2) informing the parties that the appeal
    is being treated as abandoned. This is a Notice pursuant to rule 17A (2)
    to inform the parties that the respondent's case is deemed abandoned.

 5. The effect of the respondent's case being deemed abandoned is  that  the
    proceedings before the Upper Tribunal are at an end.


Signed                              Date:  12 February 2015
