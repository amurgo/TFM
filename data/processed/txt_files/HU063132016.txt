                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Respondent, Mr Mohamed Omar Mahmoud Boraik date of birth  1st  July
    1979 is a citizen of Egypt.  Having considered all the circumstances, I
    do not consider it necessary to make an anonymity direction.

 2. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department
    (SSHD)  against  the  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal   Judge   Bell
    promulgated  on  26  October  2016  whereby  the  judge   allowed   the
    respondent's appeal against the decision of  the  SSHD.  The  SSHD  had
    refused the respondent indefinite leave to remain in the United Kingdom
    on the basis of 10 years lawful and continuous  residence  and  thereby
    refused the respondent's application  under  Article  8  of  the  ECHR,
    family and private life.

 3. By a decision of 24th April 2017 Designated First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Campbell granted permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.  Thus  the
    case appeared before me to decide whether there was an error of law  in
    the original decision.

    The grounds of appeal

 4.  It was submitted that there had been material error in respect of  the
    assessment of paragraph 276B of the Immigration Rules. The issue  being
    lawful continuous residence, it is suggested that the judge had wrongly
    assessed that there was a period of break  in  the  continuity  of  the
    respondent's leave of less than 28 days in a relevant period.

 5. As the respondent had leave, which had ended on the 30th April 2012 and
    the respondent had only re-entered the UK on the 7th June 2012. As such
    there was a period of over 28 days breach in the lawful and  continuous
    residence.  In  the  circumstances  the  judge's  finding  was  not  in
    accordance with paragraph 276A of the Immigration Rules.

 6. Further as the respondent left the UK at a time when he  did  not  have
    leave, namely in respondent May 2012 the lawfulness of the  appellant's
    leave was not continuous. The did not  meet  the  requirements  of  the
    rules.

 7. Further the judge was wrong to consider that Article 8 was  engaged  on
    the facts.

    Basic outline of the facts

 8. The respondent is a citizen of Egypt. At various times  the  respondent
    has had entry clearance and leave to enter and  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom.

 9. According to the chronology the respondent first entered the  UK  as  a
    visitor on 29 September 2005. At that stage  he  appears  to  have  had
    leave through to 22 March 2006.

10. Subsequently the respondent applied  abroad  for  leave  to  enter  the
    United Kingdom as a postgraduate doctor. It  appears  likely  that  the
    respondent made his application whilst his  existing  leave  was  still
    valid. This 2nd application  was  successful  and  the  respondent  re-
    entered the United Kingdom on 28 March 2006 with leave  valid  until  1
    May 2007. The respondent then left the United Kingdom on 3 April 2007.

11. The respondent then made an application abroad for entry clearance as a
    student. Leave was granted on 21 June 2007 with leave  valid  until  31
    October 2009. The respondent re-entered  the  United  Kingdom  on  that
    leave. Again making the application within 28 days of having  left  the
    United Kingdom.

12. The respondent then applied in country for leave to remain as a Tier  1
    Post Study migrant. The application was made on 21 September 2009.  The
    application was granted on 13 October 2009. At that stage leave was  to
    be valid until 13 October 2011. Thus far it appears to be accepted that
    the respondent had continuous lawful leave and residence through to  13
    October 2011.

13. It is at this stage that problems arise.

14. The respondent applied on 8 October 2011 leave to remain as  a  Tier  4
    General Migrant. In accordance with Section 3C of the 1971  Immigration
    Act the respondent would have leave until  the  determination  of  that
    application or until any appeal was  finally  determined.  However  the
    application was rejected on 25 October 2011.  No  appeal  against  that
    rejection was lodged, for the reasons set out below.

15. The respondent's application was made in conjunction with  applications
    by his spouse and children.  The total cost of the applications was  to
    be �772 pounds and the cost of the respondent's application alone would
    have been �386. The respondent had provided details of his bank on  his
    application form but not on the application  forms  for  his  wife  and
    children, presuming that as the details were  the  same  the  appellant
    would take monies from the account for all the applications. Copies  of
    the respondent's bank statements have been submitted and they  disclose
    that there were sufficient funds available in the account  to  pay  for
    all the applications. It is also clear from the account that  whilst  a
    request for payment in respect of the respondent was made and  paid  by
    the bank, no request was made for the spouse and child. It is not clear
    why no request for payment was made in respect of the child and spouse.



16. Of significance is  the  fact  that  a  request  for  payment  for  the
    respondent's application was made and was paid on  17th  October  2011.
    Having taken payment, the SSHD rejected the  respondent's  application,
    ostensibly on the basis that the fee had not been  paid.  Whilst  there
    may have  been  grounds  for  rejecting  the  spouse's  and  children's
    applications, payment having been requested and made in respect of  the
    respondent's  application  there  was  no  grounds  for  rejecting  the
    respondent's application.

17. As an integral part of the respondent's application at  that  time  the
    respondent was claiming to have an established presence in  the  United
    Kingdom under the rules. By reason thereof he was required to show that
    he had funds at a lower level than if he did not  have  an  established
    presence. The documentation with the original application only disclose
    financial documents showing funds sufficient to  meet  the  Immigration
    Rules as a person with an established presence.

18. The SSHD rejected the respondent's application on 25 October 2011.  The
    SSHD having rejected the application, the  respondent  was  invited  to
    resubmit his application. The respondent resubmitted the application on
    28 October 2011. In line with the  invitation  the  respondent,  rather
    than appealing  the  decision  or  seeking  to  judicially  review  the
    decision, resubmitted the application.

19. It has to be noted that the respondent's bank  account  had  the  funds
    from the original application recredited to it on 1  November  2011  by
    the appellant.

20. On 4 November 2011 the respondent's bank account paid  out  the  monies
    for all of the applications including that of the appellant in the  sum
    of �772.

21. The applications were refused on  30  April  2012.  At  that  stage  it
    appears that the applications  were  refused  on  the  basis  that  the
    respondent did not have an established presence in the  United  Kingdom
    because there had been a break in his leave between 25 October  and  28
    October 2011. Because of that  the  respondent  was  required  to  show
    financial resources at a higher level than was evident on the documents
    submitted and,  as  he  had  not,  the  application  was  refused.  The
    respondent in evidence before the judge stated that had he  known  that
    the SSHD was no longer accepting that he had an established presence he
    would have submitted further financial documents to show  that  he  had
    the funds in any  event.  Indeed  it  appears  from  the  documentation
    submitted in the form of bank statements submitted in  support  of  the
    appeals that he did have the funds.

22. Not only did the SSHD take against the respondent that he did not  have
    an established presence by reason of the break between 25  October  and
    28 October 2011 but also by reason of that break the respondent was not
    given  a  right  of  appeal.  The  structure  of  section  82  of   the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 being such at the time the
    appellant's position was that it was not as a  result  of  the  present
    decision to refuse leave that the respondent had no leave and therefore
    no right of appeal arose.

23. The decision in respect of the respondent's application was taken on 30
    April 2012. It was notified to the respondent on 2  May  2012.  In  the
    normal course of events if the respondent had been  given  a  right  of
    appeal then he would have had 14 days in which to lodge such an  appeal
    and his leave would have been extended by operation of Section   3C  of
    the 1971 Immigration Act.

24.  Documentation has been produced which confirms that the respondent was
    informed of the decision on 2 May 2012. At that stage the SSHD had  the
    respondent's passport. Discussions were  then  undertaken  between  the
    respondent and the appellant to return the  respondent's  passports  to
    him to enable him to leave the country. The passport  appears  to  have
    been returned on about 9 May and the respondent left the country on  19
    May 2012. Any delay in the respondent leaving the United Kingdom was in
    part due to the fact that he could not obtain  his  passport  from  the
    SSHD and until he had his passport he could not book a flight.

25. On return to Egypt it appears that the respondent's  passport  had  run
    out of town to be renewed. Once it  had  been  renewed  the  respondent
    immediately made application for leave to enter the United Kingdom.

26. It would have been available to the respondent to  seek  to  judicially
    review the decision taken. Rather than do that the respondent  returned
    to his home country and made application to re-enter the United Kingdom
    as a Tier 4 Migrant. Having left the United Kingdom on 7 June 2012  the
    respondent made an application for leave to enter the United Kingdom as
    a Tier 4 Migrant. That application was granted and the  respondent  re-
    entered the United Kingdom on 19 June 2012 with leave  that  was  valid
    until 28 February 2015.

27. The respondent applied on 15 February 2015  for  an  extension  of  his
    leave and was granted with leave valid until 30 April 2016.

28. The respondent then made an in-time application  on  the  basis  of  10
    years lawful residence in the UK. The SSHD refused the  application  on
    the basis that there was a break in  lawful  residence  from  the  30th
    April 2012, when the decision on the Tier 4 application was  deemed  to
    be notified to the respondent, until  after  7th  June  2012  when  the
    further application was made and granted.

29. In refusing the application policy guidance is referred to  in  respect
    of applications for long residence in the continuity of residence.  The
    policy guidance is version 15 published on 3 April 2017. Page 16 of  43
    deals with time spent outside the United Kingdom and provides that;

         Time spent outside the UK

         a person who is outside the  UK  will  not  be  in  breach  of  the
         immigration rules

         You can overlook a period of unlawful residence  if  the  applicant
         leaves the UK after their valid leave has  expired  but  before  24
         November 2016, and:

            applies for entry clearance within 28  days  of  their  original
         leave expiring

         returns to the UK  with  valid  leave  within  6  months  of  their
         original departure

30. The respondent's application for indefinite leave having  been  refused
    by decision taken on 4 September 2015. The respondent appealed and  the
    appeal was heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Bell,  who  allowed  the
    appeal on Article 8 grounds.

    The grounds of appeal

31. It is against that decision that the SSHD now appeals. In  the  grounds
    of appeal it is suggested that the  respondent  re-entered  the  United
    Kingdom unlawfully on 7 June 2012. That is not the case.  The  evidence
    clearly disclosed that the  respondent  made  an  application  and  re-
    entered the United Kingdom after that application was granted.

32. The grounds of appeal submit  that  the  judge  has  misunderstood  the
    effect of paragraphs 276 A and 276B. It is pointed out that at the time
    that the respondent left the United Kingdom he  was  required  to  have
    leave at the time of departure and that the  time  of  return.  On  the
    facts as presented the respondent did not have leave at the  time  that
    he left the United Kingdom in May 2012. It appears that his  leave  had
    expired on 30 April 2012 and he departed the United Kingdom on  19  May
    2012.

33. Further the grounds of appeal submit that the respondent  had  made  an
    application for entry clearance more than 28 days after his  leave  had
    expired. The respondent would have had an option of either  seeking  to
    judicially review the decision to seek to appeal against  it  otherwise
    but chose to leave the United Kingdom  and  make  an  application  from
    abroad.

34. It is suggested that the  judge  has  found  that  the  respondent  was
    disadvantage due to a handful of administrative errors. It is suggested
    that these should have no bearing on the decision. As  the  application
    had been rejected because the requisite fee for all the applicants  had
    not been paid, the SSHD was entitled to make  the  decision  that  they
    did. With respect that seems to wholly ignore the fact that payment for
    one of the applications had been taken. There appears to be  no  reason
    why  a  decision  could  not  have  been  taken  on  the   respondent's
    application, even if the applications by the spouse and child  were  to
    be rejected. No substantive reason has been advanced  as  to  why  that
    application would have failed at that time.

35. Further it is submitted that the judge materially  misdirected  himself
    in finding that article 8 was engaged on the facts. There  was  nothing
    exceptional within the facts and the  respondent  could  not  meet  the
    immigration rules. The respondent's private life was catered for within
    the rules.

36. The judge has failed to apply the provisions of  section  117B  of  the
    2002 Act and failed to give little weight to a  private  life  acquired
    whilst the person's status in the United Kingdom is precarious.

37. A factor which appears to have been overlooked is  the  fact  that  the
    respondent some was 7 years old and was attending school. There  appear
    to have been no assessment of the best interests of the children in the
    refusal of the SSHD.

    Consideration

38. In allowing the appeal Judge Bell found that the respondent's  original
    application of 8 October 2011 was wrongly rejected.  Certainly  on  the
    facts as presented that was a finding of fact he was entitled to  make.
    Further to that the judge was satisfied that had the matter been  dealt
    with properly the respondent would have had his leave  extended  during
    any period that he could have pursued an appeal.

39. The judge also took into account the fact that had the respondent  been
    granted a right of appeal his leave would have been extended until 16th
    of May 2012. Therefore the application  abroad  would  have  been  made
    within 28 days of his leave having  expired  and  he  would  have  been
    returning to the United Kingdom within 6 months. The  respondent  would
    therefore have fallen within the policy.

40. It was clear to the judge that the respondent had taken all  reasonable
    steps to seek to remain  inside  the  law  and  that  any  difficulties
    experienced by the respondent were due to administration on the part of
    the SSHD.

41. In light of the  circumstances  set  out  the  judge  was  entitled  to
    conclude that had the appellant been treated in accordance with the law
    in his previous applications there would not have been a break  in  the
    continuity at the lawfulness of his residence and  he  would  otherwise
    have fallen to be considered in accordance with the policy set out.

42. In light of that the judge assessed the issues under Article 8. He  was
    satisfied that there was a family and private life on the part  of  the
    respondent in the United Kingdom and that  the  decision  significantly
    interfered with such. The respondent had established a  position  as  a
    consultant ophthalmologist. In support of  his  work  as  a  consultant
    ophthalmologist the respondent had submitted documentation  to  support
    his working career. As is evident from paragraph 34 the respondent  had
    studied and worked in the United Kingdom at a high level. He  completed
    higher medical training and had worked as a  consultant  and  completed
    Masters and PhD is in the United Kingdom. He was a member of the  Royal
    College of Surgeons and a member of the Royal United Service Institute.
    Taking account of those commitments the judge was  satisfied  that  the
    respondent had established a significant and substantial  private  life
    within the United Kingdom. Given all the evidence that was a finding of
    fact that the judge was entitled to make on the judge has  given  valid
    reasons for the conclusions reached. The judge  was  clearly  satisfied
    that the factors  highlighted  warranted  consideration  of  article  8
    outside the rules.

43. The judge went on having examined all the facts to  conclude  that  the
    decision was not proportionately justified. In point of fact the  judge
    was satisfied that there was no  significant  public  interest  in  the
    respondent being returned to Egypt. Having examined  all  the  evidence
    the judge concluded that the decision was not proportionately justified
    and that it therefore breached the respondent's rights under Article  8
    of the ECHR.

44. Given the factors set out above that was a finding that the  judge  was
    entitled to make on the evidence. In the circumstances I  do  not  find
    that there is any material error of law in the decision by  the  first-
    tier Tribunal. I uphold the decision to allow this appeal.

Notice of Decision


45. I dismiss the appeal to the Upper Tribunal and uphold the  decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal to allow this appeal.

46. I do not make an anonymity direction
