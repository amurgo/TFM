For the Respondent:    Mr G Dewar, Advocate, instructed by Stewart & Watson


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1) This is an appeal by the Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department
    against a decision by Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal  Morrison.   An
    appeal by MA (hereinafter referred to as "the claimant") was allowed by
    the First-tier Tribunal under Article 8 of the Human Rights Convention.

 2) The origins of the appeal are somewhat unusual.  The Secretary of State
    refused the claimant leave to remain as long ago as 10  November  2010,
    subject to a restricted right of appeal under s 88 of the 2002 Act.  No
    appeal was made against the refusal decision at that time but in  March
    2010 a human rights claim was made.  By February 2013 the claimant  had
    new solicitors.  The new solicitors wrote to  the  Secretary  of  State
    indicating that the claimant had not  been  advised  of  her  right  of
    appeal and now wished to exercise this.   The  solicitors  pointed  out
    that the claimant's two children had both been residing in the  UK  for
    more than 7 years.  The Secretary of State was  requested  to  re-serve
    the decision together with a notice of appeal.  The case of CHH  [2011]
    UKUT 00121 was cited as authority for this course.

 3) After some further correspondence it  appears  that  the  Secretary  of
    State did re-serve the 2010 decision along with a letter of 24 May 2013
    stating that reconsideration of the earlier decision was refused.

 4) For some reason there was then a further delay until December 2013 when
    the claimant's solicitors lodged a notice of appeal.  An  extension  of
    time was granted for the lodging of this  appeal.   When  appeals  were
    made on behalf of  the  children,  however,  extensions  of  time  were
    refused by a different judge.  It  was  agreed  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal that the children should be treated as the dependants  of  the
    claimant.  The appeal  has  proceeded  on  this  basis.   No  issue  of
    jurisdiction has been raised and I consider the Tribunal  was  entitled
    to proceed to hear the appeal in terms  of  CHH.   Furthermore,  having
    regard to the analysis of jurisdiction given by Sedley LJ  in  Anwar  &
    Adjo [2010] EWCA Civ 1275, at paragraphs 19 and 20,  the  Tribunal  had
    both constitutive and adjudicative jurisdiction to hear the appeal.

 5) The claimant's immigration history is set out in the  determination  of
    the First-tier Tribunal.  She is a national of Nigeria and was born  on
    22 February 1976.  She worked as a solicitor in Nigeria  before  coming
    to the UK.  She was married in Nigeria but her two children  were  born
    in the UK in 2002 and 2004.  They are  citizens  of  Nigeria  and  have
    never had leave to enter or remain in the UK.  The older child was born
    when the claimant and her husband were visiting her  husband's  parents
    in London.  The claimant and her husband came back to the UK as  family
    visitors in 2004, when  the  younger  child  was  born.   In  2005  the
    claimant returned to Nigeria leaving her children  with  her  husband's
    parents.  She came to visit them on  several  occasions  until  January
    2007, when her husband was granted a student visa to study at  Aberdeen
    University.  The claimant has lived in Aberdeen with the children since
    April 2007.  Her leave was extended from March 2008 until  March  2010.
    The claimant's husband returned to Nigeria some time  in  2009  and  it
    seems the marriage was breaking down around that  time.   The  claimant
    had her husband were divorced in March 2010 and the claimant was  given
    custody of the children.

 6) The Judge of the First-tier Tribunal was not impressed by the  claimant
    as a witness and found her evasive.   The  judge  did  not  accept  the
    claimant's  evidence  about  her  wider  family  circumstances  or  her
    financial position.  The judge accepted, however, that the claimant  is
    in regular contact with her mother in Nigeria.  The claimant lives with
    her sons in rented accommodation in Aberdeen.  The rent  was  ï¿½600  per
    month but the judge was unable to make a finding as  to  how  this  was
    funded.  Both boys attended a primary school in Aberdeen and the  older
    boy was due to commence secondary school in August 2014.

 7) The judge had before  him  a  number  of  school  reports  and  medical
    records.  Reports for the older boy indicated that he  was  progressing
    well but the reports for the younger boy were not so positive.  Medical
    reports for the older boy indicated  that  he  had  no  ongoing  health
    issues apart from asthma.  The younger boy was assessed in  March  2012
    and recorded as "scoring significantly for  inattention,  hyperactivity
    and  impulsivity  and  oppositional  behaviour".   This  pointed  to  a
    diagnosis of ADD.

 8) The Judge of the First-tier Tribunal had regard to the  best  interests
    of the children, in accordance with  Azimi-Moayed  [2013]  UKUT  00197.
    The judge was referred to Zoumbas [2013] UKSC 74 and MK (best interests
    of child) India [2011] UKUT 00475 (IAC) and to EV (Philippines)  [2014]
    EWCA Civ 874.  The judge accepted that the children had been in the  UK
    for more than 7 years.  They were  now  aged  12  and  7  respectively.
    Their mother was their primary carer and principal source  of  support.
    She made all the day-to-day decisions in relation to their lives.   The
    older child was now at an age  where  he  would  have  made  a  lot  of
    friendships that would not depend upon his relationship with his mother
    but his mother would still be the primary influence on  his  life.   It
    was in the best interests of both boys that they continued to live with
    their mother.

 9) The judge accepted that the claimant had no entitlement  to  remain  in
    the UK in her own right.  There was no reason why she could not  return
    to Nigeria, where she could live with her mother and  find  employment.
    She should be  able  to  re-establish  her  private  life  with  little
    difficulty.  The judge was more concerned with the position of the  two
    boys.  Their best interests were to remain with their mother.   It  was
    also necessary to consider whether in all the circumstances it would be
    unreasonable for them to relocate to Nigeria.  The older boy had  spent
    almost all of his 12 years in the United Kingdom apart from  one  short
    period when he had returned to Nigeria with his  mother.   The  younger
    boy had spent his entire life in the UK.  Whatever contact the boys had
    with their father was at best sporadic and he appeared to take no  real
    part in their lives.  To remove the older boy  from  the  only  culture
    with which he was familiar would be an  extremely  serious  step  which
    would inevitably have serious effects on him.  The younger boy had  not
    been in the UK for so long but his difficulties from dyspraxia and  ADD
    were well documented in the evidence.  This would make  it  harder  for
    him to settle in Nigeria.   The  judge  concluded  that  it  would  not
    reasonable to require the children to relocate to Nigeria.  The  appeal
    was allowed under Article 8 outside the Immigration Rules.

10) In the application for permission to  appeal  the  Secretary  of  State
    argued, in essence, that the judge did not consider the case of Gulshan
    [2013] UKUT 640 as to whether there  were  arguably  good  grounds  for
    granting leave to remain outside  the  Immigration  Rules  and  whether
    there were compelling circumstances not sufficiently  recognised  under
    the Rules.  Having omitted to follow the requirements of  Gulshan,  the
    judge erred in law.

11) At the hearing before me Mr Matthews  relied  on  the  grounds  of  the
    application for permission to appeal.

12) Mr Dewar sought to rely on a note of argument lodged for the purpose of
    the hearing before the Upper Tribunal.  It was submitted in  this  that
    the Judge of the First-tier Tribunal was entitled to rely upon comments
    made about the boys by the head teacher of their primary  school.   The
    judge did not err by saying that the boys fulfilled the requirements of
    paragraph 276 ADE(iv) of the Immigration Rules.  The judge had properly
    identified the basis of the appeal before him which was  on  Article  8
    only.  He properly analysed the appeal on this basis.  On the  evidence
    the judge was entitled to conclude that the removal of the family would
    be a disproportionate interference in  the  children's  private  lives.
    The evidence before him was significant and compelling.   There  was  a
    good  arguable  case  for  consideration  of  the  appeal  outwith  the
    Immigration Rules.  The threshold legal test expounded  in  MS  (India)
    [2013] CSIH 52 was clearly and obviously met.

13) I was referred by Mr Dewar to the words of Lord Mackay of Drumadoon  at
    paragraph 28 of MS (India), where he stated:

         "As to the test that should be used, in R (Nagre) v Home Secretary,
         supra, Sales J indicated at paragraph 49 that he had concern  about
         the use of the label "exceptional cases" in the guidance  given  by
         the Home Secretary  to  describe  the  area  in  which  a  residual
         discretion to grant leave outside the Rules operates.   He  thought
         that busy, hard-pressed officials might refer only to the label and
         not keep in mind the  proper  notion  of  exceptional  cases."   He
         continued

             "Officials should take care to avoid a  `tick  box'  approach,
             genuinely bear the policy guidance in mind and seek  to  stand
             back after working through the analysis required under the new
             Rules so as to make an overall assessment of the facts to  see
             whether   there   might   be   a   good   arguable   case   of
             disproportionality if leave to remain is not granted  and,  if
             there is, to examine  that  case  with  care  to  see  whether
             removal would be justified.  The reasoning in decision letters
             should seek to demonstrate that  this  reasoning  process  has
             indeed been gone through."

         We agree entirely that officials charged  with  making  immigration
         decisions should  have  regard  to  the  substance  of  the  policy
         guidance that is given in relation to leave outside the Rules; that
         is the guidance referred to in paragraph  [7]  above.   It  can  be
         expected that  the  new  Rules  will  cover  most  cases  where  an
         applicant seeks to rely on his or her convention right  to  private
         and family life.  If an official or Tribunal or court is  asked  to
         consider leave outside the Rules, an applicant must put  forward  a
         reason for doing  so.   Such  a  reason  will  usually  consist  of
         circumstances "in which refusal would result in unjustifiably harsh
         consequences  for  the  individual  such  that   refusal   of   the
         application would not be proportionate" (in the words of  paragraph
         3.2.7d of the Home Secretary's guidance.)  We are  of  the  opinion
         that  in  considering  whether   such   circumstances   have   been
         demonstrated by an applicant, the criterion that should be used  is
         that of a "good arguable case", as suggested  by  Sales  J  in  the
         passage quoted  above.   The  decision  maker  should  examine  the
         circumstances put forward by the applicant  and  determine  whether
         they disclose a good arguable case that the Rules would produce  an
         unfair or disproportionate result such that the applicant's Article
         8 rights would be infringed.  It is only if that test is  satisfied
         that there is any need to go on  to  consider  the  application  of
         Article 8 in detail.  Furthermore,  as  Sales  J  indicates,  those
         writing decision letters should demonstrate that they  have  indeed
         addressed this test."

14) I see no difference in substance between this exposition  and  that  of
    the Upper Tribunal in Oludoyi [2014] UKUT 00539, in which it  was  said
    that there was nothing in Nagre or Gulshan to suggest that a  threshold
    test was being suggested as opposed to making it clear that there was a
    need to look at the evidence to see if there was anything which had not
    already been adequately considered in the context  of  the  Immigration
    Rules and which could lead to a successful Article 8  claim.   This  is
    also consistent with MM (Lebanon) [2014] EWCA  Civ  985.  at  paragraph
    128.

15) The position is that, as Mr Dewar submitted, the Judge  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal was entitled to reach the conclusions which he  did  upon
    the evidence before him and for the reasons which he gave.  He was  not
    required by the decision in Gulshan to apply a threshold test provided,
    as Lord Mackay of Drumadoon pointed out, that the circumstances of  the
    claimant and her children disclosed a good arguable case that the Rules
    had produced an unfair or disproportionate result such that  Article  8
    rights would be infringed.  It is clear from the consideration given by
    the judge to the circumstances of the children and, in particular,  the
    length of time they have spent in the UK, that there was  such  a  good
    arguable case which  had  not  been  adequately  considered  under  the
    Immigration Rules.  Indeed, as the judge pointed out at  paragraph  41,
    the Secretary of State appeared to have made no attempt  prior  to  the
    hearing before the First-tier Tribunal to  take  account  of  the  best
    interests of the children or the application of paragraph 276ADE(iv).

16) I find that the Judge of the First-tier Tribunal did not err in law  in
    allowing the appeals under Article 8 for the reasons which he gave.

Conclusions

17) The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law.

18) I do not set aside the decision.

Anonymity

19) The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order  for  anonymity.   I  was
    asked to make such an order on behalf of the claimant and do so in  the
    following terms.

20) Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 I make an anonymity order.  Unless the Upper Tribunal or  a  court
    directs otherwise, no report  of  these  proceedings  or  any  form  of
    publication thereof shall directly or indirectly identify the  original
    claimant or her children.  This direction applies  to  amongst  others,
    all parties.  Any failure to comply with this direction could give rise
    to contempt of court proceedings.
