Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms Randera, Legal Representative
For the Respondent:    Mr Tan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant entered the United Kingdom on April 23, 2013  with  leave
    to remain as a spouse until March 4, 2015.  On April 25, her leave  was
    extended further as the spouse of a settled person until  February  25,
    2017.

 2. On February 2, 2017 she made an application  for  indefinite  leave  to
    remain as a spouse.  The respondent refused her application on February
    16, 2018 on the basis that she failed to satisfy paragraph 287(a)(v) HC
    395 as she failed to demonstrate the parties would be able to  maintain
    themselves adequately without recourse to public funds.

 3. The appellant appealed this decision on March  2,  2018  under  Section
    82(1) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002  arguing  the
    respondent had failed to take into  account  the  appellant's  savings.
    She also submitted the  financial  evidence  that  had  been  submitted
    demonstrated that the relevant paragraph of the Immigration  Rules  had
    been met.

 4. The appellant's appeal was heard by Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Thorne on May 15, 2018 and in a decision promulgated on  June  4,  2018
    the Judge dismissed her appeal.  The main  reason  for  dismissing  the
    appeal was because the Judge noted she was  required  to  provide  bank
    statements for the six months prior to the date of application.

 5. Permission to appeal was sought on June 19, 2018 and Judge of the First-
    tier Tribunal Haria found it was arguable there had been  an  error  in
    law because the Judge had overlooked paragraph A1.1(l) of Appendix  FM-
    SE of the Immigration Rules which allowed the applicant to produce  the
    specified evidence relating to the period which ends with the  date  of
    application and that evidence or the most recently dated  part  of  the
    evidence must be dated no earlier than 28 days before the date  of  the
    application.   In  other  words,  it  was  arguable   the   Judge   had
    misinterpreted the requirements of Appendix FM-SE  of  the  Immigration
    Rules.

 6. No anonymity direction is made.

    PRELIMINARY ISSUES

 7. At the  outset  Mr  Tan  indicated  that  he  accepted  the  Judge  had
    misapplied the law in respect of  Appendix  FM-SE  of  the  Immigration
    Rules. He also accepted that the bank statements that were contained in
    the appellant's bundle, which were  said  to  have  been  sent  to  the
    respondent, demonstrated that the financial requirements of  the  Rules
    were met.

    FINDINGS

 8. In light of the identified error  in  approach  and  the  fact  it  was
    accepted the appellant did satisfy the Immigration Rules I am satisfied
    that there was a material error. The appellant satisfied paragraph  287
    HC 395 and was therefore titled to succeed under Article 8 in light  of
    recent case law.

 9. I therefore set aside the decision and I remake the decision and  allow
    the appeal on human rights grounds.

10. If the application had been properly  adjudicated  upon  the  appellant
    would have been entitled to indefinite  leave  under  the  Rules.   The
    length of any leave under article 8 ECHR is a matter for the respondent
    but should be considered against there above background.

    DECISION

11. I set aside the decision  and  I  allow  the  appeal  on  human  rights
    grounds.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a fee award and have decided to make  a  whole  fee
award of ï¿½140.
