Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr I Richards (Home Office Presenting Officer)
For the Respondent:    Mr Khan (Khuarram and Co)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the decision  of
       the First-tier Tribunal of 12 September 2016 dismissing allowing  the
       appeal of Itua Christopher Ani, a citizen of Ghana born 25  September
       1985, itself brought against the Home Office  refusal  of  his  human
       rights claim of 20 April 2015.


    2. The immigration history supplied by the Respondent sets out that  the
       Appellant entered the United  Kingdom  on  2  October  2008  and  was
       granted leave as a Tier 4 student until 31 October 2009; he then left
       the country, and was granted entry clearance  to  return  as  a  post
       study worker and granted leave until from  22  March  2012  until  22
       March 2014. He was then granted further leave  as  a  student  though
       this  was  curtailed  following  his  sponsoring  college's  loss  of
       licence, ultimately to end  on  14  February  2015.  His  application
       leading to this appeal, dated 13 February 2015, was on the grounds of
       his marriage to a British citizen, Natasha Dennison, who  he  married
       on 21 October 2014 and with whom he cohabited: he argued that she had
       strong connections in the UK including  a  network  of  friends,  and
       other social and economic ties, as well  as  suffering  from  serious
       mobility problems following a knee injury. He had put down roots here
       himself too.

    3. The application was refused because it  was  not  accepted  that  the
       relationship was a genuine and subsisting one, and given  the  length
       of time that the Appellant had  resided  in  Nigeria  (where  he  had
       family and cultural ties, and spoke the language)  before  coming  to
       the UK, it was not accepted that there were any significant obstacles
       to his integration there. Any unfairness occasioned by  the  loss  of
       his Sponsor's licence had been made good via the opportunity given to
       him to seek another educational provider within the currency  of  his
       remaining leave, and in any event he could apply for entry  clearance
       to return here in the future if he  located  a  suitable  alternative
       Sponsor.

    4. Before the First-tier Tribunal, the Appellant explained that  he  had
       returned to the UK after studying  international  business  here  and
       then returned here  three  months  later  as  a  post  study  worker,
       subsequently becoming a student once again  on  a  health  management
       course. He had been unable to find an alternative  Sponsor  once  his
       former one lost its licence. Medical evidence showed that Natasha had
       suffered cruciate ligament damage to  her  left  knee,  and  had  had
       surgery  in  August  2013,  and  might  require  further   operations
       including a bone graft. In May 2015 a doctor acknowledged  the  first
       operation had failed and set out a schedule for a further  procedure;
       in the meantime she was advised to continue with her physiotherapy.

    5. The First-tier Tribunal appeared to allow the appeal under the  five-
       year route, on the basis that all relevant  aspects  of  Appendix  FM
       including the financial requirements of six months of bank  statement
       leading up to the application date were present. In the  alternative,
       having regard to her ties in this country  and  her  documented  knee
       problems, the Tribunal was satisfied that the appeal  should  succeed
       under the ten year  route,  because  she  would  face  insurmountable
       obstacles to establishing herself abroad.

    6. Grounds of appeal argued that the First-tier Tribunal had

      1) Failed to identify relevant specified evidence by way of six
         months of bank statements leading up to the application date of
         February 2015, and indeed the First-tier Tribunal had noted that
         payments to the Sponsor had only began around that date;




      2) Failed to consider whether there were insurmountable obstacles
         amounting to very significant obstacles to life abroad in line
         with Ex.1-2 of the Rules.


    7. Judge Murray granted permission to appeal for the First-tier Tribunal
       to the Upper Tribunal on 16 May 2016 because the Judge  had  arguably
       not taken account of the dates of the  bank  statements  before  him,
       under the five-year route, and as to the ten-year  route,  failed  to
       identify why he considered there to be very significant obstacles  to
       life abroad.


    8.  Mr  Khan  for  the  Respondent  contended  that  the  decision   was
       sustainable, at least on the ten-year  route  findings,  because  the
       reasoning given was legally sufficient. Mr Richards argued  that  the
       level of reasoning was manifestly inadequate.


Findings and reasons

    9. The first question is whether the First-tier Tribunal was correct  in
       determining that the appeal succeeded under the five year route under
       Appendix FM.


   10. It seems to  me  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  was  wrong  in  its
       assessment that the salary only began to be paid from February  2015:
       in fact the employer had written a letter explaining that salary  was
       paid monthly regularly over that period, save for the  first  month's
       wages which were paid in February  2015.  However  that  is  in  fact
       irrelevant to the true difficulty confronting the attempt to  qualify
       under the five-year route.


   11. It is clear, as  was  accepted  before  me  by  Mr  Samra,  that  the
       application did not succeed under that route: the application  having
       been made in February 2015, it was necessary to produce (Appendix FM-
       SE at para 2(a)(i)), "[i]n respect of salaried employment in  the  UK
       ...  (a) Payslips covering ... a period of 6 months prior to the date
       of application if the person  has  been  employed  by  their  current
       employer for at least 6 months". However, as it was accepted that the
       Sponsor only entered employment with the employer upon who she relied
       to establish this criteria at the  start  of  October  2014,  it  was
       simply not possible for six  months  of  bank  statements  to  be  in
       existence when the application was made, less than six months later.


   12. Under the ten year route,  for  which  the  Appellant  qualified  for
       consideration  in  so  far  as  the  requirements   of   Eligibility,
       Suitability, and Immigration Status are concerned, the  key  criteria
       was whether or not he met the exception outside the Rules:


           "EX.1. This paragraph applies if ...
           (b) the applicant has a genuine and subsisting relationship with
           a partner who is in the UK and is a British Citizen, settled  in
           the  UK  or  in  the  UK  with  refugee  leave  or  humanitarian
           protection, and there are  insurmountable  obstacles  to  family
           life with that partner continuing outside the UK.
           EX.2. For the purposes  of  paragraph  EX.1.(b)  "insurmountable
           obstacles" means the very significant difficulties  which  would
           be faced by the applicant or their partner in  continuing  their
           family life together outside the  UK  and  which  could  not  be
           overcome or would entail very serious hardship for the applicant
           or their partner."

   13. It is clear that what  impressed  the  First-tier  Tribunal  in  this
       appeal was essentially the Appellant's Sponsor's connections  in  the
       United Kingdom combined with  the  serious  physical  impediment  she
       faced because of the failed  surgery  following  the  injury  to  her
       cruciate ligaments. The  Tribunal  recognised  that  her  family  was
       originally of Nigerian origin albeit that she had  not  been  to  the
       country since the age of nine, and that all her  ties  were  in  this
       country.


   14. As stated by the President in Shizad  (sufficiency  of  reasons:  set
       aside) [2013] UKUT 85 (IAC) ï¿½10: "reasons need not  be  extensive  if
       the decision as a whole makes sense, having regard  to  the  material
       accepted by the judge". It is perfectly clear to the  Appellant  (the
       Secretary of State), as it is to any member of the public  who  reads
       the decision, why  the  view  of  the  original  decision  maker  was
       overturned on appeal. There is nothing irrational in concluding  that
       a serious physical  injury  resulting  in  a  complicated  course  of
       surgery combined with strong ties to the United Kingdom  poses  "very
       significant difficulties" to life abroad which could not be  overcome
       without facing very serious hardship.


   15. The appeal of the Secretary of State is dismissed.


Signed                                       Date  12 January 2017
