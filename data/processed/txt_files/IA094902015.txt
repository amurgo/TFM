Representation:

For the Respondent:    Litigant in Person
For the Appellant:     Mr A McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.    The Appellant appeals with permission  against  the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge.

2.    The issue was whether the Judge's decision  could  stand.  Mr  McVeety
    informed me that he had discussed matters with Ms Osei. They were  both
    agreed that the appeal should be allowed. They both agreed too that the
    matter ought to be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal.

3.    As the Appellant was a litigant in prison  I  explored  whether  there
    were proper concessions by both parties. Having looked  at  the  matter
    and having satisfied myself that the Appellant understood the position,
    I then announced that I allowed the appeal as sought by the parties.

4.    In my judgment, there was a material  error  of  law  in  the  Judge's
    decision. There shall have to be  a  rehearing.  The  most  appropriate
    place for that is  at  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  as  sought  by  both
    parties.


Notice of Decision


There is a  material  error  of  law  in  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
Tribunal.
The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside.
The hearing shall be on all issues.  None  of  the  current  findings  shall
stand.

No anonymity direction is made.


Signed                                             Date: 10 May 2017


Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Mahmood
