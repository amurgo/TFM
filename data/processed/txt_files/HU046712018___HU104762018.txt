                            DECISION AND REASONS

    Background

      1. This  is  an  appeal  by  the  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
         Department.  For ease of reference, I refer below to the parties as
         they were in the First-tier Tribunal albeit that the  Secretary  of
         State is technically the Appellant in this particular appeal.   The
         Respondent appeals against a decision of First-tier Tribunal  Judge
         Bulpitt promulgated on 23 November 2018 ("the  Decision")  allowing
         the Appellants' appeals against the Respondent's decision dated  25
         January 2018 refusing the Appellants' human rights claims  made  in
         the context of an application for indefinite leave to remain by the
         First Appellant based on  ten  years'  lawful  residence  with  the
         Second Appellant as his dependent.  Since the focus of the Decision
         and the Respondent's refusal turns on the  position  of  the  First
         Appellant I refer to him hereafter as the Appellant.

      2.  The  basis  of  the  Respondent's  refusal  of   the   Appellant's
         application is that there was a discrepancy  between  self-employed
         income declared to HMRC for the tax year ending 5  April  2013  and
         that declared to the Home Office in order to obtain leave to remain
         at that time.    The  application  was  therefore  refused  by  the
         Respondent applying paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules ("the
         Rules") on the basis that his character and conduct were such  that
         his continued presence in the UK was not conducive.

      3. The Judge heard oral evidence from the Appellant and accepted  that
         he had not been dishonest and that the discrepancy was  due  to  an
         error  by  his  accountants.  He  therefore  concluded   that   the
         Appellant's character and  conduct  did  not  render  his  presence
         undesirable and since he otherwise met the Rules based on  his  ten
         years' unlawful residence, the  appeals  should  succeed  on  human
         rights grounds.

      4. The Respondent challenges the Decision on the basis that the  Judge
         made a material misdirection of law on a material matter by failing
         to apply case-law in this area.  I note that this case is  not  the
         only one of its kind.  Indeed, as  is  evidenced  by  the  document
         entitled "Review of  Applications  by  Tier  1  (General)  Migrants
         Refused under Paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules"  published
         by the Home Office on 22  November  2018,  there  have  been  1,697
         applications of a similar nature refused under the  same  provision
         of the Rules which involve  a  similar  factual  context  to  these
         appeals. As I pointed out in the course of Mr Melvin's submissions,
         however, that does not mean that all applicants  who  have  wrongly
         declared income to either of the Home Office or HMRC have all  done
         so dishonestly.  Much turns on the facts of the case.

      5. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Mark
         Davies on 18 December  2018  in  the  following  terms  so  far  as
         relevant:

             "...

             [2] It is arguable that the Judge  did  not  place  sufficient
             weight on the fact that  it  is,  as  a  matter  of  law,  the
             personal obligation of every tax payer when completing his  or
             her tax return to ensure that the details  provided  are  true
             and correct.  He or she cannot abrogate that responsibility to
             his or her accountant or any other person.

             [3] The grounds and the decision do disclose an arguable error
             of law."

      6. The matter comes before me to decide whether the Decision  contains
         a material error of law.  Both parties accepted that,  if  I  found
         there to be an error of law in the Decision, since the challenge is
         effectively to the credibility findings made by the Judge, it would
         be appropriate for the appeals to be  remitted  to  the  First-tier
         Tribunal for re-hearing  and  reconsideration  of  the  Appellant's
         credibility.

    Decision and Reasons

      7. I begin with the way in which the Judge  approached  what  was  the
         central issue in this case,  namely  whether  the  Appellant  acted
         dishonestly or genuinely was  unaware  of  the  accountant's  error
         based on the evidence before the Judge.

      8. I begin by noting that the discrepancy was a  significant  one,  in
         the single sum of �30,000.  The Appellant's case is  that,  in  the
         tax year in question, he  earned  �20,593.91  as  an  employee  and
         �31,148 as self-employed running a business called ADN Solutions, a
         business he had started in 2010.  Those are the figures declared to
         the Home Office.  The figures provided to HMRC for the  same  year,
         though, were �21,250 employed income and only �1,145  self-employed
         income.

      9. The error is described in a letter from  his  then  accountant,  ZG
         Consultants dated 11 October 2018 in the following terms:

             "...We can confirm that an administrative error was made while
             submitting our clients'  tax  return  for  the  period  stated
             above.  The error for the first  time  was  triggered  to  our
             client and eventually to us by Home  Office's  Refusal  Notice
             dated 25 January 2018. Please be advised that  the  error  was
             not a deliberate act but was a  pure  human  error  and  after
             finding out the error, the revised  return  was  submitted  to
             HMRC with a same explanation as here.   We  can  also  confirm
             that HMRC accepted the  revised  tax  return  for  the  above-
             mentioned tax year without imposing any penalty to our  client
             and confirming that the error was not  a  wilful  act  but  an
             administrative mistake."

     10. As Mr Melvin pointed out  in  submissions,  that  letter  does  not
         really explain the error at  all,  particularly  in  light  of  the
         significant  amount  involved.   Being  somewhat  generous  to  the
         accountants, the only assumption which one can make to explain  the
         error is that a "3" was missed off a five-figure  sum  and  only  a
         four-figure sum was included (as the  figures  are  otherwise  very
         similar).  However, the tax difference between the two should  have
         been evident to any competent accountant.  Nor is it quite  correct
         to suggest that HMRC did not impose  any  penalty  since  they  did
         charge the Appellant interest.  That, Mr  Halim  says,  is  further
         reason why the blame for the error should not be placed at the door
         of the Appellant since he did not stand to benefit.  That  ignores,
         though, as Mr Melvin pointed out, that the benefit was of  a  grant
         of leave in 2013 where, if the  correct  figure  for  self-employed
         income were the �1,145 declared to HMRC, the  Appellant  would  not
         have scored sufficient points for a grant of leave.

     11. The Judge set out at [9] of the Decision the facts which  were  not
         disputed and include the discrepancy between the earnings  declared
         to the Home Office and HMRC in the relevant tax  year.   The  Judge
         also set out  the  evidence  at  [16]  to  [28]  of  the  Decision,
         including reference to the Appellant's  earnings  in  previous  and
         subsequent years.  As I pointed out in the course  of  submissions,
         there was a clear dip in self-employed income from ADN Solutions in
         the tax year immediately prior to the tax year in question  but  in
         the year before that, the self-employed income was  not  dissimilar
         to that declared to the Home Office in  the  2013  tax  year.   The
         Appellant's bundle includes the  tax  calculations  for  the  other
         years but, as Mr Melvin points out, does not include  the  accounts
         relating to ADN Solutions.  I assume, however, that those must have
         been produced to the Respondent at the time when leave  was  sought
         in 2013 to evidence the Appellant's income.  Those are not produced
         by the Respondent to support the discrepancy on which  reliance  is
         placed or to draw attention to any other inconsistencies.  I assume
         therefore that the accounts would show the figures declared to Home
         Office rather than those declared to HMRC.  That does not of course
         mean that the figures declared were genuine but if  the  Respondent
         relies on over-declaration of income to him, I would expect him  to
         produce the evidence on which that assertion is based.

     12. The Judge had regard to the reasons  given  by  the  Respondent  as
         recorded at [10] of the Decision as follows:

             "...The respondent says that the first appellant has therefore
             been dishonest in his dealings either with the respondent when
             applying for leave to remain or the HMRC  when  declaring  his
             taxable income.  In either event the respondent  asserts  that
             this  is  conduct  which  means  it  is  undesirable  for  the
             appellant to be granted indefinite leave to remain."

     13. Having recorded the Respondent's reasons and  the  evidence  before
         him, the Judge set out his reasons for his decision on  this  issue
         as follows:

             "[29]     It is accepted  that  the  first  appellant's  self-
             assessment tax return for the year  ended  5  April  2013  was
             incorrect and that as a result the first  appellant  paid  far
             less tax that year than he should have done.  It is  also  not
             in dispute that this error was  only  exposed  when  enquiries
             were made as part of the  respondent's  consideration  of  his
             application for indefinite leave to remain.   Although  it  is
             not expressly conceded by the respondent there  is  compelling
             evidence that following the  error  being  exposed  the  first
             appellant has corrected the tax return to HMRC and is repaying
             the tax owed.  The core facts relating to the issue in dispute
             are therefore not controversial.  What is  hotly  disputed  is
             what  inference  should  be  drawn  from  these  facts.    The
             respondent says that the inference to be  drawn  is  that  the
             first appellant was dishonest in his dealings  with  HMRC  and
             therefore it is undesirable for him to be permitted to  remain
             in the United Kingdom.  The appellant by contrast states  that
             this was a simple error for which he was not  responsible  and
             which he  did  not  appreciate  until  it  was  drawn  to  his
             attention years later when he immediately made recompense.

             [30]      I was provided with a number of unreported decisions
             from  the  Upper  Tribunal  after  hearing  cases  which  were
             factually similar to this one.   Those  decisions  demonstrate
             that there are cases where erroneous  tax  returns  have  been
             found to amount to conduct and character which means it  would
             be undesirable to permit an applicant to remain in the  United
             Kingdom and also that there  are  cases  where  erroneous  tax
             returns have been found not to  amount  to  such  conduct  and
             character.  As  I  stated  during  submissions  I  find  these
             unreported cases to be of very limited assistance on  what  is
             quite clearly an issue which turns on its facts.

             [31]      I find that it is more likely than not that the self-
             assessment return  for  the  year  ending  5  April  2013  was
             completed by ZG Consultants, accountants employed by the first
             appellant for the purpose of managing  his  tax  and  business
             account affairs.  I make this finding based on the letter from
             ZG consultants, the fact the business accounts  are  shown  to
             have been prepared by ZG consultants and  the  fact  that  tax
             calculations prepared by HMRC on  01  November  2017  show  ZG
             consultants  acting  on  behalf  of   the   first   appellant.
             Accordingly  I  find  it  was  the  G  [sic]  consultants  who
             erroneously recorded  the  first  appellant's  self-employment
             income in that tax return.

             [32]      I have gone on to consider  what  awareness  of  the
             error the appellant had at the time and whether the error  was
             made deliberately and for  a  dishonest  purpose.   The  error
             itself is a stark one  and  not  an  error  one  would  expect
             competent accountants to make.   The  first  appellant  states
             that he doesn't recall signing tax returns  before  they  were
             submitted.     The    return    itself    would    demonstrate
             incontrovertibly  whether  he  had  signed  it  and  in  these
             circumstances I am wary of the failure to include  it  in  the
             appellant's bundle.  Irrespective of  whether  he  signed  the
             return,  as  a  professional  business  consultant  the  first
             appellant will have been aware that he was responsible for the
             contents of his tax return.  Again, regardless of  whether  he
             signed the self-assessment return, when he  received  his  tax
             bill for the year it will have  been  apparent  to  the  first
             appellant that it was for less money than  the  previous  year
             despite him earning �30,000 more.  These are all factors which
             tend to suggest that the first appellant must have been  aware
             of the error and therefore it was made for dishonest purposes.

             [33]      Factors which suggest that the first appellant might
             not have been aware of the error include the fact that he  did
             task professional accountants to complete the tax  return  and
             would therefore be entitled to place some  reliance  on  their
             competence.  It is apparent that the first appellant relied on
             ZG consultants without any adverse issue in other regards  for
             example to prepare the business accounts.   It  is  also  well
             recognised that the calculation of a person's tax  obligations
             is a complex process.  This is best indicated by the change in
             the first appellant's personal tax obligations when his income
             changed from self-employment to dividends from company in  the
             following tax year ending 5 April 2014.  This change  saw  the
             tax paid by the appellant personally reduce while the  company
             paid corporation tax.  It is also relevant that the  erroneous
             return in 2013 does appear to be an  anomaly  with  no  issues
             being taken over the returns in the surrounding years and  the
             first appellant paying considerable sums of interest in  those
             years.  Finally the response of  the  appellant  in  making  a
             revised return, agreeing a payment plan and sticking  to  that
             payment plan are all indications that this was a genuine error
             which the first appellant is keen to put right.

             [34]      Balancing the factors which suggest  that  the  2013
             tax return was a  dishonest  one  against  the  factors  which
             suggest it was a genuine error I attach particular  weight  to
             the  appellant's  response  following  the  discovery  of  the
             discrepancy.  I also attach particular weight to the fact that
             his tax  returns  in  the  surrounding  years  have  not  been
             challenged and these have resulted in him  paying  significant
             amounts of tax on his income.  Finally I take  regard  of  the
             fact that at the time of the tax return in question the son of
             the first and second  appellants  was  born,  plus  the  first
             appellant had two demanding jobs as a Pizza  Hut  manager  and
             business  consultant.   In  these  circumstances  and   having
             engaged professional accountants to make his tax return I find
             that it is more likely than not that the  failure  to  provide
             the correct information to HMRC about  the  first  appellant's
             income from self-employment in the tax year ending April  2013
             was a genuine error and was not a dishonest attempt  to  evade
             his tax obligations."

     14. I turn then to the Respondent's  grounds  of  challenge.  The  only
         ground pleaded is that the Judge made a misdirection in law.  It is
         said that the Judge failed to take into account  the  decisions  of
         the Tribunal in R (on the application of  Samant)  v  Secretary  of
         State for the Home Department [2017] UKAITUR/6546/2016 and Abbasi v
         Secretary of State for the Home Department (JR/13807/2016).  It  is
         said that the Judge has failed to note the point that the Appellant
         is responsible for his own tax affairs.  This is  the  point  which
         found merit with Judge Davies when granting permission.

     15. As Mr Halim points out, those decisions relate to judicial  reviews
         where the issue is whether the Respondent reached a decision  which
         is outside the reasonable range of responses. By contrast, a  Judge
         hearing an appeal is expected to reach findings on the facts  which
         this Judge has done.

     16. I am satisfied that there is no error disclosed by this point.  The
         Judge expressly notes the Appellant's responsibility  for  his  tax
         returns at [32] and notes the absence of documents to show that the
         Appellant did not sign this  tax  return.   Further,  although  the
         Judge at [30] may have erred in not giving weight to  case-law  put
         to him insofar as that included the cases of Samant and Abbassi, on
         the basis that those are unreported (as substantive judicial review
         decisions are all reported), nonetheless I accept Mr Halim's  point
         that they have limited relevance in terms of the legal issues which
         apply as they are judicial review decisions.

     17. The other case on which the Respondent relies however of R (on  the
         application of Khan) v Secretary of State for the  Home  Department
         (Dishonesty, tax return, paragraph 322(5)) [2018] UKUT 00384  (IAC)
         falls into a slightly different category.  Although that also is  a
         decision in a judicial review, it is a decision  which  includes  a
         headnote providing reported guidance.  Although, as Mr Halim points
         out, that too is guidance when dealing with  judicial  reviews,  he
         did accept that particularly (iv) and (v) of the headnote can apply
         by analogy to a Judge dealing with an appeal.

     18. It is not clear to me whether the case of  Khan  was  before  Judge
         Bulpitt.  It is not cited.  However, since  that  is  not  a  point
         which Mr Halim took, I assume that it was - it appears to have been
         reported prior to the hearing of these appeals.

     19. The part of the headnote in Khan to which the Respondent refers  is
         at (iv) and (v) as follows:

             "(iv)      For  an  Applicant  simply  to  blame  his  or  her
             accountant for an "error" in relation to  the  historical  tax
             return will not be the end  of  the  matter,  given  that  the
             accountant will or should have asked the tax payer to  confirm
             that the return was  accurate  and  to  have  signed  the  tax
             return.  Furthermore the Applicant will have known of  his  or
             her earnings and will have expected to pay  tax  thereon.   If
             the Applicant does not take steps within a reasonable time  to
             remedy the situation, the Secretary of State may  be  entitled
             to conclude that this  failure  justifies  a  conclusion  that
             there has been deceit or dishonesty.

             (v) When considering whether or not the Applicant is dishonest
             or merely careless the Secretary of State should consider  the
             following matters, inter alia, as well as the extent to  which
             they are evidenced (as opposed to asserted):

                  i.    Whether  the  explanation  for  the  error  by   the
                  accountant is plausible;

                  ii.  Whether the documentation which  can  be  assumed  to
                  exist (for example, correspondence between  the  Applicant
                  and his accountant at the time of the tax return) has been
                  disclosed or there is a plausible explanation for  why  it
                  is missing;

                  iii. Why the Applicant did not realise that an  error  had
                  been made because his liability to pay tax was  less  then
                  he should have expected;

                  iv.  Whether, at any stage, the Applicant has taken  steps
                  to remedy the situation and, if so, when those steps  were
                  taken and the explanation for any significant delay."

     20. The point raised at (iv) is dealt with by the Judge at [32] of  the
         Decision.  I have already explained why I am satisfied  that  there
         is no error in that regard.  Dealing with the points made at (v) of
         the headnote, although I accept that the Judge did deal with  these
         matters, as I pointed out to Mr Halim, he  appears  to  have  found
         against the Appellant on all those  issues.   I  therefore  queried
         whether it was open to the Judge thereafter to accept  as  credible
         the Appellant's testimony.  However, as Mr Halim also pointed  out,
         the list at (v) is not said to be exhaustive (evidenced by the  use
         of the words "inter alia").  The Judge balanced  the  evidence  for
         and against the Appellant and reached a conclusion which  was  open
         to him on that evidence.

     21. That brings me on to the alternative submission made by  Mr  Melvin
         namely that the Judge's conclusion was  irrational.   As  Mr  Halim
         pointed out, the Respondent did not plead this in the  grounds  and
         it is not a point on which permission was given. In any event, I am
         not satisfied that there is an error of law in this regard.  Whilst
         it may not have been the decision I  would  have  reached  on  this
         evidence, I cannot say that it was not a  conclusion  open  to  the
         Judge for the reasons he gave.

     22. There is one further point which is identified obliquely at (e)  of
         the  grounds  and  was  mentioned  briefly  by  Mr  Melvin  in  his
         submissions which I also deal with it and that is whether it can be
         said that the Judge failed to take into  account  the  Respondent's
         alternative case that, rather than being  an  under-declaration  of
         income to HMRC, the Appellant had over-declared income to the  Home
         Office in order to obtain leave in  2013.   However,  there  is  no
         indication that the Respondent advanced a  positive  case  in  this
         regard.  I recognise that the Respondent cannot know which  of  the
         set of figures put forward to HMRC and Home Office  are  false  and
         which true; hence the reliance on a case put  in  the  alternative.
         However, as I have already observed above,  there  must  have  been
         documents put to the Respondent in 2013 which satisfied him at  the
         time as to the earnings claimed.

     23. At the very least,  if  the  Respondent  wishes  to  argue  in  the
         alternative that the dishonesty relates back to the application for
         leave to remain made in 2013, I would expect  him  to  produce  the
         evidence which was provided to him at the time  about  earnings  in
         order to identify the discrepancies.  Even in the absence  of  such
         evidence, the Respondent could be expected to explain to the  Judge
         the benefit which the Appellant would have derived which  he  would
         not otherwise have obtained and why.  It does not appear  from  the
         Decision that this was the way in which the Respondent  argued  the
         case in these appeals.  The Judge has noted the  reference  in  the
         reasons  for  refusal  letter  but  absent  further   evidence   or
         submissions putting a  positive  case  on  this  basis,  I  am  not
         satisfied that there is any error of law in the Judge's failure  to
         deal with it thereafter.

     24. The Respondent's grounds do not disclose an error  of  law  in  the
         Decision.  I uphold the Decision  with  the  consequence  that  the
         Appellants' appeals remain allowed.

    DECISION

    I am satisfied that the Decision does not contain a material  error  of
    law. I  uphold  the  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Bulpitt
    promulgated  on  23  November  2018  with  the  consequence  that   the
    Appellants' appeals stand allowed
