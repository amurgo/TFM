Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Morgan Read, Counsel, instructed by Newcastle
Legal Centre
For the Respondent:    Mr John Kingham, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. Pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 (SI 2008/2698) I make  an  order  prohibiting  the  disclosure  or
    publication of any matter likely to  lead  members  of  the  public  to
    identify the appellant. Breach of this  order  can  be  punished  as  a
    contempt of court. I make the order because the appellants are children
    or young adults.

 2. The appellants appeal against the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    dismissing the appellants' appeals  on  immigration  and  human  rights
    grounds against a decision taken on 16 March  2014  refusing  entry  to
    join their parents in the UK.

Introduction

 3. The appellants are citizens of Bangladesh born in 1995, 1997, 1999  and
    2001. They sought entry clearance to join their parents, SB who  has  a
    certificate of abode for the UK and NH who has limited leave to  remain
    for 27 months as the husband of SB.

 4. The respondent refused the applications on financial and  accommodation
    grounds under paragraph 301  of  the  Immigration  Rules.  The  claimed
    combined parental income of ï¿½31,727 was not accepted and the respondent
    did not accept that NH lived  at  the  claimed  family  home  in  South
    Shields, thereby leading to the conclusion that documents  in  relation
    to the claimed family home were not reliable.

The Appeal

 5. The appellants appealed to the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  the  parents
    attended an oral hearing at North Shields on 23 January 2015. The judge
    found that the parents were earning  what  they  claimed  but  was  not
    satisfied that they were living together at the  claimed  family  home.
    There was no doubt that the accommodation  at  that  address  would  be
    adequate to house all of the appellants but  the  judge  could  not  be
    satisfied that there was an adequate income going into  that  household
    to maintain the appellants. The  judge  was  not  satisfied  that  NH's
    earnings were available for the maintenance of the appellants.

The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

 6. The appellant sought permission to appeal on 24 February 2015.

 7. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Bird  on
    15 April 2015 on the basis that it was arguable that the judge had made
    contradictory findings and  had  given  no  adequate  reasons  for  the
    rejecting the evidence which showed that the parents were living at the
    same address. All grounds were arguable.

 8. In a rule 24 response dated 3  June  2015,  the  respondent  sought  to
    uphold the judge's decision on the basis that the witness evidence  was
    unsatisfactory, the tenancy agreement was only in the name  of  SB  and
    there was only one piece  of  documentary  evidence  from  the  council
    referring to NH residing at the claimed family home.

 9. Thus, the appeal came before me.

Discussion

10. Mr Read submitted that there was no  dispute  about  the  marriage  and
    there was a presumption that the  parties  would  be  living  together.
    Balance  of  probability  was  satisfied.  There   was   a   reasonable
    explanation for the fact that NH was registered to vote at a  different
    address. The letter from the council clearly supported the  proposition
    that the parents were living  together  at  the  time.  No  grounds  or
    reasons were given by the judge  for  rejecting  the  letter  from  the
    council as unreliable.

11. Mr Kingham submitted that the presumption of marriage was not raised at
    the refusal stage. The document verification report showed that NH  was
    not living at the same address. The judge carefully considered  all  of
    the documents and the conclusions drawn were properly open. The further
    evidence now submitted was not before the judge and did not  create  an
    error of law. There was no contradiction in the judge's findings. There
    would have been enough income if the parents were in the same household
    but they were not living together.

12. Mr Read submitted in response that the judge gave insufficient  reasons
    for finding at paragraph 13 that the parents were not living  together.
    The accommodation was adequate on  the  basis  that  the  parents  were
    living together.

13. I find that the judge made a series of positive findings in  favour  of
    the appellants. The joint parental income was sufficient  to  meet  the
    requirements of  the  Rules  and  the  accommodation  was,  in  itself,
    adequate to house the appellants. There were bank statement  with  NH's
    name at the claimed family home and a communication from HMRC  to  that
    address. There was a letter from the council stating  that  the  writer
    had been advised that  NH  was  living  at  the  claimed  family  home.
    However, the judge was also  not  satisfied  that  there  was  adequate
    income going into the claimed family home to maintain the appellants. I
    find that the judge's reasoning is somewhat tortuous and agree with the
    submission that the judge has not given adequate reasons for  rejecting
    the strong evidence that NH was living at the claimed  family  home  at
    the date of decision.

14. Thus, the First-tier Tribunal's decision  to  dismiss  the  appellant's
    appeals involved the making of an error of law and its decision  cannot
    stand.

15. I have not found it necessary to hear further evidence before re-making
    the decision. The judge was concerned about the fact that  NH  appeared
    on the electoral roll at a different address but I  am  satisfied  that
    the parents gave an adequate explanation for  that  fact;  namely  that
    they previously lived together  at  the  different  address  and  moved
    together to the claimed family home in 2013. The  judge  was  concerned
    that different dates were given for the  move  to  the  claimed  family
    home; namely May 2013 in the grounds of appeal, July  2013  by  SB  and
    August 2013 by NH. I find that the grounds of appeal  were  plainly  in
    error and there was no significant difference in the dates given by  SB
    and NH.

16. The letter dated 7 October 2013 from the council clearly refers  to  NH
    and SB living together at the claimed family home. That  address  is  a
    four bedroom council house which is suitable for the  parents  and  the
    appellants. It would be unusual for the parents  to  have  organised  a
    four bedroom council house and made the application for entry clearance
    for the appellants if they were not living together and wishing to live
    as a family with their children. There is nothing in the  documents  to
    suggest that NH was not  living  at  the  claimed  family  home.  I  am
    satisfied that the only sustainable conclusion  from  the  evidence  is
    that NH and SB were residing together at the date of decision and  that
    the requirements of the Rules were met.

Decision

17. Consequently, I set aside the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal.  I
    remake the decision by  allowing  the  appeals  under  the  Immigration
    Rules.
