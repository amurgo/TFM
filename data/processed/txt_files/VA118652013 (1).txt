                                BEKIR EKINCI
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                     ENTRY CLEARANCE OFFICER - ISTANBUL
                                                                  Respondent

                          NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL AND
                   REASONS FOR THE TRIBUNAL GIVING CONSENT

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Turkey.  He  appealed  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal against a decision of the ECO refusing him entry clearance as a
    visitor. The First-tier Tribunal dismissed the appeal in a determination
    promulgated on 15 January  2014.  Judge  Pooler  granted  the  appellant
    permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.

 2. By way of a letter to the Upper Tribunal dated the  23  April  2014  the
    appellant's legal representative states that "the  appellant  no  longer
    wishes  to  proceed  with  this  hearing",  having  first  set  out  the
    appellant's name, appeal reference number and the date of hearing before
    the Upper Tribunal (14 May 2014).

 3. Consent of the Upper Tribunal is required for a party  to  withdraw  its
    case. Having carefully considered the facts of this appeal as  a  whole,
    and observing that the ECO was the successful party  before  the  First-
    tier Tribunal, I give such consent to  the  appellant  to  withdraw  his
    case.

 4. Accordingly with my consent, and pursuant to rule 17(5) of the  Tribunal
    Procedure (Upper Tribunal)  Rules  2008,  this  appeal  is  recorded  as
    "Withdrawn with the consent of the Upper Tribunal".  This  is  a  Notice
    pursuant to rule 17(5) to inform the parties that the  appellant's  case
    is withdrawn.

 5. The effect of the  appellant's  case  being  withdrawn  from  the  Upper
    Tribunal is that the proceedings before the Upper  Tribunal  are  at  an
    end. There is no appeal before the Upper  Tribunal  and  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's decision shall stand.
