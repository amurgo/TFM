Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals with  permission  against  the  decision  of  the
    Secretary of State to refuse her further leave to remain as the  spouse
    of her husband, because  she  could  not  satisfy  the  minimum  income
    requirements set out in Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules HC 395 (as
    amended) including Section EX.1 of Appendix FM.  Both  parties  are  of
    Indian origin although the husband is now a British citizen and settled
    in the United Kingdom.

 2. The First-tier  Judge  accepted  that  the  marriage  was  genuine  and
    subsisting, but the evidence was that the  sponsor  husband  had  never
    earned as much as ï¿½18,600 per annum,  the  wife  having  been  admitted
    before the requirement was set at that level.

 3. The parties had the misfortune to be represented by Malik Law  Chambers
    and when I last heard this appeal on 26 April 2018 they  had  been  the
    subject of an intervention by the Solicitors Regulation Authority  some
    7 days earlier on 19 April  2018  and  Sky  Solicitors  had  been  very
    recently instructed.  I granted an adjournment  of  the  error  of  law
    hearing, to give Sky Solicitors time to become properly  instructed.  I
    directed relisting after two months, with  a  Punjabi  interpreter.   I
    gave the appellant permission to appeal her grounds of  appeal,  if  so
    advised, within 14 days, and the respondent  permission  to  amend  his
    Rule 24 Reply, if so advised.

 4. Sky Solicitors took the opportunity to amend their grounds of appeal on
    8 May 2018. The amended grounds rely on Huang, Razgar and Chikwamba  in
    rather generic terms as  well  as  EB  (Kosovo)  before  proceeding  to
    contend that the First-tier  Tribunal's  reasoning  is  inadequate  and
    insufficient and that the First-tier Judge committed an error of law in
    finding that there were no compassionate or compelling circumstances.

 5. The appellant's case as now advanced is that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    erred in law in failing properly to consider the family unit or Article
    8 ECHR rights.  Strikingly there is no mention of the Immigration Rules
    in the grounds of appeal, which are directed only to Article 8  outside
    the Rules.

 6. There are no compassionate or compelling circumstances in this case and
    it may well be that the appellants have been so  advised  because  they
    have neither appeared nor arranged representation for the hearing  this
    morning.

 7. On the basis of the evidence  and  the  amended  grounds,  I  am  quite
    satisfied that the grounds disclose no arguable no  material  error  of
    law in the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  I  dismiss  the
    appeal.
