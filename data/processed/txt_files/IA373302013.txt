                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

      1.    The Appellant (the Secretary of State) appealed with  permission
           granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Pooler  on  24  June  2014
           against the determination of First-tier Tribunal Judge Aujla who
           had allowed the Respondent's appeal  against  the  Secretary  of
           State's  decision  dated  30  August  2013  in  a  determination
           promulgated on 3 June 2014.  The Respondent  is  a  national  of
           India, who had applied for further leave to remain as a  Tier  4
           (General) Student Migrant, which was refused on the grounds that
           although the Appellant had submitted a valid CAS,  she  had  not
           shown that  she  satisfied  the  maintenance  requirement.   The
           Appellant had provided a letter from the State  Bank  of  India,
           stating that she had been given  a  loan  of  5,000,000  Rupees,
           equivalent to �5,418.48.  The Appellant  was  required  to  show
           that the loan was provided by the national government, the state
           or regional government or a government  sponsored  student  loan
           company, or was part of an academic or educational  scheme,  but
           had not done so.  The application was  refused  under  paragraph
           245ZX(d) of the  Immigration  Rules.  The  reasons  for  refusal
           letter conveying the decision to refuse to vary the Respondent's
           existing leave incorporated a  second  decision  to  remove  the
           Respondent  by  way  of  directions  under  section  47  of  the
           Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.

      2.    Judge Pooler considered it arguable that Judge Aujla should  not
           have concluded that the loan from the State Bank of India was  a
           loan from the government of India.  While the bank may be  owned
           by the government of India, they are separate  entities.   There
           was no evidence that  the  bank  was  part  of  an  academic  or
           educational loans scheme.


      3.    Mr Avery for the Appellant relied on the onwards grounds and the
           grant of permission to appeal.  He submitted that it was, as the
           First-tier Tribunal Judge had observed,  a  narrow  point.   The
           fact that the State Bank of India was government owned  was  not
           in dispute.  The point which the judge had overlooked  was  that
           it was a separate entity.  The connection between the  loan  and
           the state had  not  been  shown.   The  judge  had  fallen  into
           material error of law to have considered otherwise.  The  appeal
           fell to be dismissed because the Immigration Rules in  force  at
           the date of decision had not been met.


      4.    It was not  necessary  to  call  upon  the  Respondent  who  had
           attended in person.


      5.    At the conclusion of submissions the tribunal indicated that  it
           found that the judge had not fallen into material error of  law.
           The determination was full  and  careful,  prepared  by  a  very
           experienced judge.  The document which he had been  required  to
           construe in the context of an application for further  leave  to
           remain was dated 22 July 2013.  Addressed to the Respondent,  it
           was headed "State Bank of India" and further  headed  "Education
           Loan".  The Respondent's  unchallenged  evidence  was  that  her
           previous applications which had all been granted had  been  made
           on the same basis. [8] and [9] of the determination refer to the
           Respondent's witness statement dated 6 May 2014  in  which  that
           had been stated.  It was not in dispute that the Respondent  had
           paid her tuition fees amounting to �11,000  and  was  a  genuine
           applicant.


      6.     The  judge's  conclusions  are  set  out   at   [19]   of   his
           determination.  He found that the education loan was  sanctioned
           by  the  bank  and  was  provided  indirectly  by  the  national
           government of India.


      7.    The tribunal should  not  interfere  with  a  properly  reasoned
           determination of a First-tier Tribunal judge unless there  is  a
           clear and material error of law.  In the factual context of this
           appeal, the judge's conclusions were open to  him.   The  bank's
           letter was perhaps slightly vague, which widened the  scope  for
           its construction.  The judge had to decide the issue one way  or
           another, and it is implicit that when doing so  he  should  have
           had regard to the merits of the case, which were plainly in  the
           Respondent's favour.  The judge did  not  make  the  mistake  of
           conflating the ownership of the State Bank  of  India  with  the
           government  of  India,  because  he  found  that  the  link  was
           indirect.  The key finding was the link.


      8.    Paragraph 245ZX(d) of the Immigration Rules refers  to  Appendix
           C, paragraphs 10 to 14.  Paragraph 1B(d) of Appendix C  is  also
           applicable.  It is as follows:


            "(d) If the applicant is  applying  as  a  Tier  4  Migrant,  an
           original loan letter from a financial institution regulated  for
           the purpose of student loans by  either  the  Financial  Conduct
           Authority (FCA) and the Prudential  Regulation  Authority  (PRA)
           or, in the case of overseas accounts,  the  official  regulatory
           body for the country the institution is in and where  the  money
           is held, which is dated no more than 6 months before the date of
           the application and clearly shows:
            (1) the applicant's name, (2) the date of the  letter,  (3)  the
           financial institution's name and logo, (4) the  money  available
           as a loan, (5) for applications for entry  clearance,  that  the
           loan funds are or will be available to the applicant  before  he
           travels to the UK, unless the loan is  an  academic  or  student
           loan from the applicant's country's national government and will
           be released to the applicant on arrival in the UK, (6) there are
           no conditions placed upon the release of the loan funds  to  the
           applicant, other than him making a successful application  as  a
           Tier 4 Migrant, and (7) the loan is  provided  by  the  national
           government, the state or regional  government  or  a  government
           sponsored student loan company or is  part  of  an  academic  or
           educational loans scheme."


      9.    In the tribunal's view it was open to the judge to construe  the
           State Bank of India letter dated 22 July 2013 as falling  within
           Paragraph 1B(d)(7) of Appendix C, either as having been provided
           indirectly  by  the  national  government,  or  as  part  of  an
           educational loans scheme.  Indeed the latter construction  might
           well be regarded as  stronger  still  on  the  facts.   But  the
           judge's  construction  was  sufficient,   and   was   adequately
           reasoned.


      10.   The Secretary of State's appeal is dismissed.


      DECISION


      The making of the previous decision did not involve the making  of  an
error on a point of law.  The determination stands unchanged
