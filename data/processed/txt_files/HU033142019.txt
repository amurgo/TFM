                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant appeals against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge
    Lever promulgated on 5 June  2019,  in  which  the  Appellant's  appeal
    against the decision to refuse his  application  for  leave  to  remain
    based on long residence under paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules
    dated 4 February 2019 was dismissed.

 2. The Appellant is a national of Pakistan, born on 20 May 1982, who first
    arrived in the United Kingdom in 2006 with valid entry clearance  as  a
    student.  The Appellant was granted leave to remain as a student, to 28
    February 2010, and subsequently granted leave to remain  as  a  Tier  1
    Post-Study Migrant to 12 March 2012 and as a Tier 1 General Migrant  to
    24 May 2013 and then to 11 June 2016; prior to  which  he  applied  for
    indefinite leave  to  remain  in  the  same  category.   Prior  to  the
    determination of that application, the Appellant varied his application
    on 8 December 2016, as one for indefinite leave to remain on the  basis
    of long residence in the United Kingdom.

 3. The Respondent refused the application the  basis  that  the  Appellant
    failed to  meet  the  suitability  criteria  and  the  application  was
    primarily refused under paragraph 322(5) of the  Immigration  Rules  on
    the basis that it would be undesirable for the Appellant to  remain  in
    the United Kingdom in light of his character and conduct.  This was  on
    the basis that the Appellant had misrepresented his  earnings  and  had
    changed what he represented in respect of his earnings  to  HM  Revenue
    and Customs and/or UK Visas and Immigration for the purpose of reducing
    his tax liability or the purpose of obtaining leave to remain or  both.
    In his application for  leave  to  remain  dated  to  April  2011,  the
    Appellant claimed to have an income of �39,712.94 between 1 April  2010
    and 31 March 2011, including dividends to the  value  of  �36,880  from
    self-employment.   However,  the  initial  tax  return  filed  by   the
    Appellant with HMRC for the same period, did not include  any  earnings
    from dividends.  An amended tax return was filed  in  2016  to  declare
    dividend earnings of �36,666 for this period.  In  response  to  a  tax
    questionnaire sent to the Appellant by  the  Respondent,  he  confirmed
    that an  amendment  to  his  tax  records  was  required  as  incorrect
    submissions were made by his accountants initially  and  this  was  not
    noticed by the Appellant although he checked the tax  return  prior  to
    its submission.

 4. Judge Lever dismissed the appeal in a decision promulgated  on  5  June
    2019 on all grounds.  In summary, the First-tier  Tribunal  found  that
    the Respondent had discharged  the  first  task  of  raising  a  proper
    suspicion in support of the Respondent's assertion of dishonesty by the
    Appellant and went on to  look  at  the  explanation  provided  by  the
    Appellant in respect of this.  It was  found  that  the  Appellant  had
    obtained a Master of Business Administration degree, which may not have
    contained a detailed study of tax or accounting, but that the Appellant
    has set up was running a business as a  self-employed  businessmen  and
    was solely responsible for generating and passing data to an accountant
    and it was considered implausible that had the accountant been provided
    with all of the relevant information by the Appellant, that they  would
    fail to record the totality of the dividends paid to the  Appellant  as
    his primary source of income.  Although the Appellant's accountants had
    written a letter, that contained no  explanation  of  the  human  error
    claimed and little weight was attached to this document.  It was  noted
    that the Appellant did not seek to correct the error until  some  years
    later prior to the application  for  indefinite  leave  to  remain  and
    further that little weight was attached to  the  fact  no  further  tax
    liability arose following the amendments to the tax returns.  This  was
    because the Appellant's account was that he was ignorant of tax matters
    and therefore would not have known at the time of filing whether or not
    there would be a greater tax liability and in any event, the  intention
    to deceive and to act dishonestly was considered  to  be  the  relevant
    consideration and not the potential loss of tax revenue.

 5.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  was  satisfied  that  the   Appellant   was
    deliberately dishonest in providing a false and wholly inflated  figure
    to the Home Office in his application for leave to remain in  2011  and
    concluded that on the totality of the evidence, there was  no  innocent
    explanation against the suspicion of this  raised  by  the  Respondent.
    Finally, the First-tier Tribunal considered all of the  factors  for  a
    refusal under paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration  Rules  but  did  not
    find any reason to depart from the general view and that there were  no
    counterveiling features to prevent refusal on unsuitability grounds.

 6. Finally, the First-tier Tribunal considered whether the Appellant could
    meet the requirements of paragraph  276ADE(1)(iv)  of  the  Immigration
    Rules, but found that there would be no very significant  obstacles  to
    his reintegration to Pakistan.  Overall and  taking  into  account  the
    factors in section 117B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act
    2002, the Appellant's removal was not found to  be  a  disproportionate
    interference with the Appellant's right to respect for private life and
    no family life had been established in the United Kingdom.

The appeal

 7. The Appellant  appeals  on  numerous  grounds  which  are  not  clearly
    numbered or identified individually but unhelpfully form extended  text
    in relation to the decision  under  appeal.   The  main  focus  of  the
    grounds of appeal are in relation to what is described in  the  grounds
    as the material point in the determination, the Appellant's  dishonesty
    in failing to declare his dividend in his personal tax return.  On this
    issue,  the  grounds  of  appeal  are  that  the  First-tier   Tribunal
    materially erred in law in failing to consider that the  Appellant  did
    not have to pay any additional tax because his company had paid tax  on
    the income, such that dividends were in effect taxed at  source,  which
    was a key part of the Appellant's innocent explanation.  Further,  that
    the First-tier Tribunal erred in fact in stating that  the  Appellant's
    dividend income was his only  source  of  income,  where  the  evidence
    showed that the Respondent accepted that he also had PAYE income.

 8.  In  addition,  the  Appellant  claims  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    conflated dishonesty with a breach of duty in relation to tax  returns;
    reached  an  irrational  conclusion  that  the   Appellant's   academic
    qualifications would  have  enabled  him  to  appreciate  detailed  tax
    matters; attached insufficient weight to the letter from the accountant
    and  failed  to  take  into  account  that  there  was  only  a  single
    discrepancy in the Appellants declarations.

 9. In the final sentence of the grounds of appeal,  the  Appellant  claims
    that the  First-tier  Tribunal  materially  erred  law  in  failing  to
    consider that his application of 2 April 2011 for leave to remain would
    only have been successful if the  Respondent  was  satisfied  that  the
    specified evidence had been provided to show that  he  and  the  income
    requirements.

10. At the oral hearing, we queried with Mr Gajjar  the  relevance  of  the
    grounds of appeal focusing on the  Appellant's  omission  in  declaring
    dividend income to HMRC initially for the  period  in  2011  given  the
    express finding by the First-tier Tribunal in paragraphs 25 and  26  of
    the decision that  the  dishonesty  in  this  case  was  aimed  at  the
    Respondent in the Appellant's application for leave to remain in  April
    2011 and no express finding of dishonesty to HMRC was made.  Mr  Gajjar
    accepted in these circumstances that the main  points  in  the  written
    grounds of appeal could not ultimately be material to  the  outcome  of
    the  appeal  in  light  of  this  finding  of  dishonesty  against  the
    Respondent, which alone engages conduct relevant to paragraph 322(5) of
    the Immigration Rules.  The focus of the oral submissions on behalf  of
    the Appellant were then on the final sentence of the grounds of appeal,
    which was submitted to be broad enough, when read in  conjunction  with
    the original grounds of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal, to challenge
    the finding of dishonesty against the Respondent, including that  there
    were inadequate reasons for this finding in the  First-tier  Tribunal's
    decision.

11. Mr Gajjar submitted that although it was  potentially  permissible  for
    the First-tier  Tribunal  to  conclude  that  the  Appellant  had  been
    dishonest in his application  to  the  Respondent  in  2011,  the  bare
    finding in paragraph 25 was a material error of law because there was a
    failure  to  consider  all  relevant  factors,  specifically  that  the
    application in  2011,  made  with  specified  evidence  supporting  the
    claimed income, was accepted  by  the  Respondent  on  the  balance  of
    probabilities.  It was accepted that  a  previous  grant  of  leave  to
    remain is not binding on  any  future  application,  but  that  in  the
    present case there was nothing further to undermine that decision.   In
    particular, the incorrect tax declaration made in 2011 does not lead to
    a conclusion that the income declared to the Respondent  for  the  same
    period was wrongly declared.

12. On behalf of  the  Respondent,  Ms  Isherwood  reiterated  the  factual
    circumstances in this  appeal,  with  the  basis  of  the  Respondent's
    refusal under paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules being that  the
    Appellant had misrepresented his earnings to  the  Respondent  for  the
    purposes of obtaining leave to remain in 2011,  or  had  misrepresented
    his earnings to HMRC for the purpose  of  reducing  tax  liability,  or
    both; with a discrepancy between the declarations of over �36,000.  The
    Appellants declaration of earnings to HMRC was only  amended  in  2016,
    shortly before his application for indefinite leave to  remain.   Prior
    to  the  Respondent's  decision,  the  Appellant   was   sent   a   tax
    questionnaire stating that there was an oversight and miscalculation by
    his accountants and also stating that the  Appellant  checked  his  tax
    return prior to its submission.  The Appellant's  explanation  for  the
    discrepancy in declarations to  different  government  departments  was
    essentially that there was a genuine error in his  initial  declaration
    to HMRC, with no dishonesty or intention to reduce  his  tax  liability
    and the position was later corrected.  The implication follows that the
    Appellant  maintained  that  his  declaration  of   earnings   to   the
    Respondent's application for leave to remain in 2011 was entirely  true
    and accurate.

13. The First-tier Tribunal  considered  the  Appellant's  explanation  and
    rejected it for the reasons  given  in  paragraphs  17  to  24  of  the
    decision.  In particular, it was noted that the Appellant  had  himself
    checked his tax return before its submission and the explanation of  an
    error by the accountant was rejected given the lack of  detail  in  the
    letter from them.

14. Overall, it was submitted on behalf of the Respondent that there was no
    error of law in the finding in paragraph 25 of the  decision  that  the
    Appellant was dishonest in his application to the Respondent for  leave
    to remain in 2011.  It is not enough for the Appellant to  simply  rely
    on the fact that that the earlier application was successful  when  new
    evidence came to  light  subsequently  about  the  discrepancy  in  his
    declaration of earnings and the amendment of his tax returns.

Findings and reasons

 1. The issues in this appeal essentially come down to a single point about
    whether the findings in paragraphs 25 and 26 of the decision contain  a
    material error of law.  As accepted  by  the  parties,  this  issue  is
    determinative of the appeal.  If there is no error in  these  findings,
    paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules is engaged and  there  is  no
    further challenge to the second stage assessment of the application  of
    discretion under this paragraph, nor is  there  any  challenge  to  the
    conclusions in relation to Article 8  of  the  European  Convention  on
    Human Rights.  Any errors by the First-tier Tribunal about declarations
    to  HMRC,  in  particular  as  to  tax  liability,   the   accountant's
    explanation and breach of duty would not be material.  If on the  other
    hand there is an error of law in the findings in paragraphs 25  and  26
    of the decision, that is sufficient of itself for the decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal to be set aside as those errors  would  infect  the
    remaining findings under the Immigration Rules and Article 8.

 2. The Appellant's two main issues with the findings in paragraphs 25  and
    26 are that first, there was no consideration  of  the  fact  that  the
    Appellant's application in 2011, on the basis of specified evidence  of
    income, was  successful;  and  secondly,  that  there  were  inadequate
    reasons for the findings.  The second point does not feature at all  in
    the grounds of appeal to the Upper tribunal and will not be  considered
    further as a result.

 3. Although it is not set out in the clearest way, when read  as  a  whole
    the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  does  follow  a  structured
    approach to the assessment of dishonesty/deception as  alleged  by  the
    Respondent in the reasons for refusal  letter.   It  is  accepted  that
    there was sufficient evidence from the  Respondent  to  raise  a  clear
    suspicion  of  dishonesty  based  on  the  discrepant  declarations  of
    earnings to 2 different government departments  for  the  same  period.
    The Respondent's decision was on the basis of  dishonesty  against  the
    Respondent, or HMRC, or both.

 4. In response, the explanation provided by the Appellant  only  addresses
    in substance, the allegation that he had misrepresented his earnings to
    HMRC for the purpose of reducing his tax liability.  In support of this
    he claimed that there was an error by his accountant,  not  spotted  by
    himself when checking the form, in failing to declare his dividends  to
    HMRC which was corrected when identified and there was no tax advantage
    in failing to declare the dividend income.   The  amended  tax  returns
    confirmed that no further  tax  was  payable,  corporation  tax  having
    already been paid on the company's profits and the Appellant benefiting
    from a tax credit on the dividends as a result.  Although not  set  out
    expressly by the Appellant, it can be inferred that  his  position  was
    that the declaration of earnings to the Respondent, consistent with his
    amended tax returns, were correct.

 5. The First-tier Tribunal  considered  in  detail  the  elements  of  the
    Appellant's explanation about why his initial tax return was said to be
    wrong and rejected these for the reasons set out in paragraph 17 to  24
    of the decision.  The Appellant's reliance on there  being  no  further
    tax liability from the amendment was set out in  paragraph  23  (albeit
    without any reference to corporation tax paid or the  detailed  reasons
    for there being no further liability) but rejected in paragraph 24  for
    two main reasons.  First, it was  the  Appellant's  case  that  he  was
    ignorant of tax matters when the tax return was filed and he could  not
    therefore have known or predicted that the failure to declare dividends
    at that time would have a benefit or no impact on at  all  on  his  tax
    liability.   Secondly,  it  is  the  intention  to  deceive   and   act
    dishonestly rather than whether there was  in  fact  any  loss  of  tax
    revenue which is relevant for the  purposes  of  conduct  in  paragraph
    322(5) of the Immigration Rules.  We find no  error  of  law  in  these
    conclusions reached by the First-tier Tribunal which were open to  them
    on the evidence available.

 6. In any event, there was no finding that there was dishonesty to HMRC in
    the initial tax return, to the contrary,  reading  the  decision  as  a
    whole and in particular the finding that  the  dishonesty  was  in  the
    declaration of earnings to the Respondent, by implication  and  by  the
    rejection of the claim that there was no genuine error at the time, the
    First-tier Tribunal appears to accept  that  it  was  the  initial  tax
    return to HMRC that was correct.

 7. There was no further or express explanation by the Appellant as to  his
    earnings declared to  the  Respondent  in  2011,  merely  the  implicit
    reliance on  this  declaration  being  correct.   There  was  therefore
    nothing of substance on this claimed deception against  the  Respondent
    for the First-tier Tribunal to consider in  any  detail.   We  find  no
    error of law in the findings in paragraphs 25 and 26 of  the  decision,
    in these circumstances and following the rejection of  the  Appellant's
    explanation of a mistake in the initial tax returns to  HMRC,  even  in
    the absence of any express reference to or consideration in  this  part
    of the decision to the application for leave to remain in  2011  having
    been successful.  This was clearly known as  part  of  the  Appellant's
    immigration history and could not, in any event, be material let  alone
    determinative against the finding of dishonesty, given what has come to
    light since the application was made and  the  other  findings  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal.  In  all  cases  such  as  this  one,  there  will
    inevitably be a previous successful application for leave to remain.

 8. We find no material error of law in any of the remaining points made in
    the written grounds of appeal.  In particular the factual  error  about
    whether the Appellant's income was solely from dividends or whether  he
    had small PAYE income as well is wholly immaterial to the  findings  in
    the decision, similarly the fact that there was only a discrepancy in a
    single year is not a material consideration which would  have  affected
    the outcome of the appeal in light of the other findings  made  and  in
    light the fact that the discrepancy was over �36,000, which on any view
    is a  significant  sum.   Finally,  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  not
    conflate dishonesty with a breach of  duty,  as  above,  there  was  no
    finding of dishonesty in the initial earnings declaration to HMRC.

Notice of Decision

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve  the
making of a material error of law.  As such  it  is  not  necessary  to  set
aside the decision.

The decision to dismiss the appeal is therefore confirmed.

No anonymity direction is made.
