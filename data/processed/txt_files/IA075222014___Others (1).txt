                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1.  These  are  the  linked  appeals  of  the   appellants   against   the
    determination of First-tier Tribunal Judge Thorne  promulgated  23.6.14
    dismissing their appeals against the  decisions  of  the  Secretary  of
    State, dated 23.1.14, to refuse their applications for leave to  remain
    in the UK.  The Judge heard the appeal on 9.6.14.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge Page granted permission to appeal on 21.7.14.

 3. Thus the matter came before me on 24.10.14 as an appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 4. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Thorne should be set aside.

 5. The lengthy grounds of appeal raise a number of  complaints  about  the
    determination of the First-tier Tribunal, including that the judge made
    no reference to the established case law and applied  the  wrong  legal
    tests, if any were applied, and failed to properly  consider  the  best
    interests  of  the  children  affected  by  the  Secretary  of  State's
    decision.

 6. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Page stated,  "It  is  apparent
    from the judge's determination, which contains a paucity  of  reasoning
    and does not make easy reading, that the judge  has  given  little,  if
    any, weight to the position of these children." It is stated that it is
    not clear how the judge came to his conclusions and did not explain why
    the evidence was considered to be "inadequate."

 7. "Consequently the ground of appeal that the judge did not apply anxious
    scrutiny to the position of  these  children  is  arguable.  Given  the
    paucity of reasoning in the determination and the passing reference  to
    evidence that has  been  considered  but  not  detailed,  the  detailed
    grounds that the judge has  made  various  errors  in  considering  the
    evidence may  also  be  arguable.  These  appeals  have  a  complicated
    background. The grounds of appeal at paragraph 3-F argue that the judge
    has failed to grasp relevant detail. Permission is granted for all  the
    grounds to be fully considered by the Upper Tribunal."

 8. The first difficulty is that the judge  may  have  misapprehended  what
    decisions were under appeal. The refusal decision of 23.1.14 was issued
    in respect of both parents and both children. The child appellant was 6
    years of age at the date of the hearing, but another  child,  Charlene,
    was already 7 years of age, though her appeal had been  ruled  invalid.
    However, at �30 the  judge  appears  to  think  that  the  decision  in
    relation to the first appellant was made on 13.9.13. The 'new' decision
    of 23.1.14 was made after the issue of Judicial Review proceedings.

 9. As these are in-country appeals, the relevant date is normally the date
    of decision, 23.1.14. The judge found that all applications  were  made
    after 9.7.12 and thus the 'new' Rules applied. As neither parent  is  a
    British citizen or settled in the UK, neither qualify under Appendix FM
    as partner. Neither parent had sole responsibility for the children and
    thus they did not qualify as parents of a child in the UK. As the  only
    child appellant before the judge was still 6 years of  age,  she  could
    not meet paragraph 276ADE. Neither child had in fact lived  in  the  UK
    for 7 years immediately preceding  the  date  of  application.  In  the
    circumstances, there was no error of law  in  finding  that  the  three
    appellants did not meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules.

10. There is no merit in the argument that the judge was  wrong  to  regard
    Charlene's appeal as invalid. There is no right of appeal to the  Upper
    Tribunal against the decision made under Rule  10  of  the  Asylum  and
    Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.

11. The relevant provisions dealing with the right of appeal from decisions
    of the First-tier Tribunal to the Upper Tribunal are contained in  s.11
    of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 as follows:

          "11. Right of appeal to the Upper Tribunal

          (1) For the purposes of subsection (2), the reference to  a  right
         of appeal is to a right to appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal  on  any
         point of law  arising  from  a  decision  made  by  the  First-tier
         tribunal other than an excluded decision.

          (2) Any party to  a  case  has  a  right  of  appeal,  subject  to
         subsection (8).

          (3) That right may be  exercised  only  with  permission  (or,  in
         Northern Ireland, leave).

          (4) Permission (or leave) may be given by -

         (a) the First-tier Tribunal, or

         (b) the Upper Tribunal,

         on an application by a party."

12. The right of appeal is from any decision of the First-tier Tribunal  on
    a point of law other than an "excluded decision." Section 11(5) of  the
    2007 Act sets out what, for  the  purposes  of  subsection  (1)  is  an
    "excluded" decision. None of the decisions in  s.11(5),  as  originally
    enacted, are relevant to this appeal. However, Article 3 of the Appeals
    (Excluded Decisions) Order  2009  (SI  2009/275  as  amended)  added  a
    further decision to the  category  of  "excluded  decisions"  which  is
    relevant. Article 3 states that:

          "3. For the purposes of section 11(1) and 13(1) of the  Tribunals,
         Courts and Enforcement Act 2007, the  following  decisions  of  the
         First-tier Tribunal or the Upper Tribunal are excluded decisions -

         ....

         (m) any procedural,  ancillary  or  preliminary  decision  made  in
         relation to an appeal against a decision under section 40A  of  the
         British  National  Act  1981,  section  82,  83  or  83A   of   the
         Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, or regulations 26  of
         the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006."

13. That provision reflects the wording of s.103A(7)  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (now repealed) which excluded from  the
    category of decisions of the  Asylum  and  Immigration  Tribunal  which
    could be subject to the reconsideration process  any  "decision  on  an
    appeal" which was "a procedural, ancillary  or  preliminary  decision".
    The words "procedural,  ancillary  or  preliminary"  which  define  the
    nature of the decision remain the same; the current provision (s.11(1))
    requires that the decision be "in relation to an  appeal",  whilst  the
    reconsideration framework (s.103A(7)) required it to be a decision  "on
    an appeal".

14. There is no doubt that the decision in this  case  is  a  "preliminary"
    decision by the First-tier Tribunal. Indeed, rule 10(6) of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Procedure Rules states, inter alia, that

          "The Tribunal must decide any issue as  to  whether  a  notice  of
         appeal was given in  time,  or  whether  to  extend  the  time  for
         appealing, as a preliminary decision without a hearing..."

15. That reflects what must be the natural meaning, and  consequent  effect
    of, the legislative words initially in s.103A(7) of the  2002  Act  and
    now found in Art 3(m) of the 2009 Order as amended.

16. In the circumstances, there can be no valid  appeal  before  the  Upper
    Tribunal against the refusal of the First-tier Tribunal to extend  time
    so that the  appeal  of  Charlene  was  not  accepted  as  valid.  That
    appellant's remedy is Judicial Review of the decision.

17. I find that the First-tier Tribunal Judge properly  considered  whether
    there were arguably good grounds for  considering  family  and  private
    life under Article 8 ECHR outside the Rules on the basis of  compelling
    circumstances insufficiently recognised in the Rules and  which  render
    the decision of the Secretary of State unjustifiably harsh, referencing
    Gulshan. However, as there was no  proportionality  assessment  in  the
    consideration of Appendix FM or paragraph 276ADE, which do  not  amount
    to a complete code for consideration of private and  family  life,  the
    judge should have gone on to consider private  and  family  life  under
    article 8 ECHR. Indeed, he is required to do so under section 86 of the
    2002 Act, it being a ground of appeal.

18. The judge's treatment of article in the alternative, set out at �52  is
    entirely inadequate. It does not amount to a carefully  proportionality
    assessment, balancing on the one  hand  the  private  and  family  life
    rights of the appellants and on the other the  legitimate  aim  of  the
    state to protect the economic well-being of the UK through  objectively
    applied Immigration Rules. Whilst some  factors  militating  in  favour
    removal are mentioned, there is no indication that any factors  in  the
    appellants'  favour  have  been  taken  into  account.  The  article  8
    assessment is inadequate and flawed, amounting to an error of law.

19. I also agree with Judge  Page  that  the  judge  has  given  inadequate
    reasons for several of the findings in the determination. For  example,
    at �32 the judge did  not  accept  that  the  children  did  not  speak
    Cantonese with their parents. Neither did the judge explain why some of
    the evidence was inadequate. There is thus an error of law  in  failing
    to provide adequate reasoning for findings of fact.

20. Without needing to go through the grounds or determination in detail, I
    also find and it is clear from any reading of  the  determination  that
    the First-tier Tribunal failed to give adequate  consideration  to  the
    children of the family and to determine their best interests.  Both  of
    the references to the  children  are  in  the  negative.  There  is  no
    consideration of the current case law in respect of the best  interests
    of the children, or assessment of their length of time in  the  UK  and
    the degree of settlement here, including friends, family and education.
    There was no finding as to the impact of their removal, other  than  to
    say that the evidence was inadequate, and no reference to the  material
    in  the  appellants'  bundle  in  support  of  the  children.  In   the
    circumstances, I find that there is  an  error  of  law  by  inadequate
    consideration of the best interests of  the  children,  such  that  the
    determination cannot stand and must be set aside and remade.

21. In making that finding, I must make it clear that a  rehearing  of  the
    appeals could well still result in their  dismissal,  especially  given
    that other factors now need to be considered, including the  effect  of
    section 117B. However, unless and until the appeals are considered with
    reference to the correct approach and case law, I cannot say  that  the
    outcome is inevitable or that the errors disclosed are immaterial.

Conclusion & Decision

22. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should
    be set aside.

     I set aside the decision.

                    The appeals are  adjourned  for  a  continuation/resumed
                    appeal hearing.

Consequential Directions

The appeals are relisted for  a  continuation  hearing  reserved  to  Deputy
Upper Tribunal Judge Pickup to take place at Manchester on 17.2.14,  with  a
two-hour hearing estimate.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.




Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The outcome of the appeals remain to be determined.
