                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Country guidance


   (1)    In the aftermath of the armed revolution that  brought  about  the
       fall of the dictatorial and repressive regime  of  Colonel  Qadhafi,
       the central government in Libya has relied on  various  militias  to
       undertake security and policing functions. Those  militias  and  the
       many  others  that  operate  within  Libya,  often  have  their  own
       interests, loyalties and priorities which may or  may  not  coincide
       with the interests of the central government.

   Article 15(c)

   (2)    There is not such a  high  level  of  indiscriminate  violence  in
       Libya, within the meaning of  Article  15(c)  of  Council  Directive
       2004/83/EC ("the  Qualification  Directive")  so  as  to  mean  that
       substantial grounds exist for believing that  an  individual  would,
       solely by being present there, face a real risk which threatens  his
       or her life or person.

   Former regime members and associates

   (3)    Having regard to the generally hostile attitude of society to  the
       former regime, the following  are,  in  general,  at  real  risk  of
       persecution or Article 3 ill-treatment on return to Libya: -

     (a) former high ranking officials within the intelligence services  of
       that regime;

       (b) others with an association at senior level with that regime.

     (4)      As a general matter, the  closer  an  individual  was  to  the
       centre of power within the former regime, the more  likely  that  the
       individual will be able to establish a risk of persecution or Article
       3 ill-treatment on return.

   (5)    The majority of the population of Libya  either  worked  for,  had
       some association with, or has a member of the family who worked  for
       or had an association with the Qadhafi regime.  Such  employment  or
       association  alone  is  not  sufficient  to  establish  a  risk   of
       persecution or Article 3 ill-treatment on return.

   (6)    In general, family members of those described in (3) and (4) above
       are not at risk of persecution or a breach of their protected rights
       on return. It is possible, however, that an individual will be  able
       to establish such a risk but this will need to  be  demonstrated  by
       specific evidence relating to the individual's  circumstances.  Mere
       assertion of risk by association as a family  member  would  not  be
       sufficient without  fact-specific  evidence  of  the  risk  to  that
       particular family member.

   Black Libyans etc

    (7)   A 'Black Libyan' is a Libyan  of  black  African  appearance,  and
       includes a person who may not actually  possess  Libyan  nationality
       but for whom Libya is their country of  former  habitual  residence.
       There is endemic racism within Libyan society towards Black Libyans.
       However, Black Libyans who are not Tawurga or Tuareg are not per  se
       at risk of persecution or Article 3  ill-treatment  on  return,  and
       will only be able to establish the need for international protection
       with  reference  to  some  additional  factor  particular  to   that
       individual.

   (8)    The Tawurga are Black Libyans who are perceived by Libyans to have
       been mercenaries on the side of  the  Qadhafi  regime  and  to  have
       committed human rights abuses during the revolution. The Tuareg  are
       also Black Libyans and are also perceived to have been supporters of
       the former regime.

   (9)     Whilst there remains a need for an individual assessment of  each
       individual's circumstances, a person who is Tawurga or  Tuareg  will
       in  general  be  able  to  establish  the  need  for   international
       protection. The same is true of persons from the  Mashashiya  ethnic
       or tribal group. The  Mashashiya  are  not  Black  Libyans  but  are
       similarly perceived as a  group  to  have  been  supporters  of  the
       Qadhafi regime.

   Women

    (10) Whilst Libya is a male-dominated society and there is  evidence  of
       discrimination and violence against women and  poor  recognition  of
       women's rights, being female does not per se  establish  a  risk  on
       return.  However,  taking  into  account  all   the   circumstances,
       including a woman's age, health, level  of  education  and  economic
       status, one or more of the following characteristics or factors  are
       likely,  depending  on  the  circumstances,  to  be  significant  in
       relation to the assessment of risk on return for a woman:

     a)  African ethnicity;

        b)   Being a victim of sexual violence, including having been raped
          by soldiers loyal to the Qadhafi regime or by other combatants;

            c) Being a woman accused or suspected of sexual misdemeanours or
          offences against family honour.

   Failed asylum seekers

   (11)   Failed asylum seekers are not, for that reason alone, at real risk
       on return.

   Risk at point of return

   (12)   There is no real risk of harm to the ordinary  traveller  arriving
       either at Tripoli international airport or Benghazi airport.

   (13)   However, a person who has established that they come within one of
       the risk categories set out at (3), (4), (9) and (10) above, will be
       at risk from government security forces or from militias, on arrival
       at Tripoli International Airport, on account of information that  is
       required to be given by passengers on arrival.







   Risk following return

   (14)   Even if a person described in (13) above is able to  pass  through
       the airport without being  detained,  because  of  the  presence  of
       militias at various checkpoints such a person is  reasonably  likely
       to be detained at a checkpoint en route to his or her home area.

   (15)   Notwithstanding the prevalence of checkpoints manned by  militias,
       it is possible to travel overland  from  Tripoli  airport  to  other
       destinations without a real risk of  persecution,  serious  harm  or
       Article 3 ill-treatment. Land travel in general is possible and  can
       be undertaken without giving rise to a risk of  harm  that  requires
       recognition in terms of international protection. The evidence  does
       not reveal such a level of arbitrary or irrational  conduct  on  the
       part of  militias  at  checkpoints  such  as  to  put  the  ordinary
       traveller at real risk.  A  claim  to  international  protection  is
       unlikely to succeed simply on the basis of a claimed risk of  travel
       to any particular area of Libya. Area specific evidence  would  have
       to be adduced which establishes such a risk.

   (16) The 'family book' is the main proof of citizenship,  listing  family
       members and being required, for example, to obtain employment  or  a
       bank loan. However, the fact  that  a  person  does  not  possess  a
       'family book' would not prevent travel within Libya and the lack  of
       a family book would not itself give rise to a risk of harm.

   Sufficiency of protection

   (17)   In general, an individual who succeeds in establishing a real risk
       of harm by reference to the risk categories set out at (3), (4), (9)
       and (10) above, will not be afforded  a  sufficiency  of  protection
       from that harm.

   Internal relocation

   (18) Likewise, such individuals would not, in general, have available  to
       them the option of internal relocation.

   (19)   For persons who have established a real risk  of  proscribed  ill-
       treatment in their home area for a reason other than by reference to
       one of the categories set out above, for example because of a family
       or tribal feud, or because of hostility from a  particular  militia,
       it is possible to be able safely to travel from one part of Libya to
       another, depending on whether the reason for the risk  is  one  that
       would  give  rise  to  further  risk  for  that  same   reason,   on
       encountering a checkpoint.

    (20) A male seeking to avoid a local risk of harm such as  described  in
       (19) above, would be able in practical terms to relocate to  another
       area of Libya, be it for example Tripoli or  Benghazi,  particularly
       if the person has tribal or family connections there. The absence of
       such connections would not  prevent  the  person  from  establishing
       himself, in the sense of being able to live in the new community and
       find accommodation. It would not be unduly harsh for such  a  person
       to relocate internally.

   (21) However, such a person may not be able to avoid a risk of harm in  a
       new area where the person has no connections in terms of  tribal  or
       family links, but the person or group that is feared does have  such
       links.  A  fact-specific  enquiry  is  essential.   An   appellant's
       assertion that the individual or group that is feared has  links  to
       say,  Tripoli  or  Benghazi,  or  another   prospective   place   of
       relocation, will need to be assessed in the light of the findings in
       relation to overall credibility.

   (22) In relation to the possibility for a woman to  relocate  internally,
       taking into account the position of women in society in  Libya,  the
       difficulty for women of accessing accommodation if  alone,  and  the
       rarity of a woman arriving in a community without knowing any person
       there, internal relocation would not  be  reasonable  and  would  be
       unduly harsh unless in the prospective area of relocation the  woman
       has a close family  or  significant  other  connection,  aside  from
       merely a tribal connection.

   (23) In addition, bearing in mind the above factors, a woman is likely to
       be more conspicuous with the  result  that  her  presence  may  more
       easily be discovered by the prospective persecutor.

   (24) The following cases are superseded  by  this  decision  and  are  no
       longer to be treated as providing country guidance:

Introduction

    1. The so-called 'Arab Spring' brought about momentous changes  in  the
       Middle East and North Africa. The durability of  those  changes  has
       yet to be determined but it is evident that the  process  of  change
       continues.  In Libya the regime of Colonel Qadhafi[1] was swept away
       by armed revolution in 2011, with  many  being  killed  or  injured,
       serious human rights abuses having been committed,  and  individuals
       and groups forced from their homes or displaced.

    2. In the aftermath of  the  revolution,  the  central  government  has
       struggled to maintain authority and has had to rely, to a greater or
       lesser extent, on various militias  to  undertake  certain  security
       functions that traditionally fall within a government's sole  remit.
       There are a plethora  of  militias  with  local,  tribal  and  other
       loyalties. Divisions along ethnic and tribal  lines  that  had  been
       more muted during the Qadhafi years have become more  evident.  This
       determination  considers  the  viability   of   return   to   Libya,
       particularly in relation to certain categories of people who may  be
       returned there from the UK and whether on return  there  is  a  risk
       that persons would face a breach of their protected rights.

    3. We had the benefit of hearing evidence from three experts:  Dr  Alan
       George, Dr Geoff Porter and Professor Emile Joff�. Their written and
       oral evidence was invaluable in assisting us in our determination of
       the issues and we are grateful to them.

    4. We should also like to record our appreciation of the efforts of all
       counsel and solicitors who represented the  appellants  and  counsel
       and the Treasury Solicitors team  on  behalf  of  the  Secretary  of
       State. The evidence relied on by  the  parties  has  evidently  been
       carefully prepared  and  assembled,  with  clear  written  and  oral
       arguments which have similarly assisted us greatly.

    5. Mindful of the potential for events in Libya post-hearing to  affect
       our assessment of the issues, we indicated to the  parties  that  if
       any party considered that relevant events needed to  be  brought  to
       our attention, the parties may write to the Tribunal setting out the
       details of the events and inviting the Tribunal to reconvene. We are
       aware that the situation in Libya has  not  been  static  since  the
       hearing of the appeal, and the country's troubles continue  to  make
       the news. However, none of the parties has contacted the Tribunal to
       draw our attention to any specific  events  that  have  taken  place
       since the hearing, asked for the hearing to be reconvened  or  asked
       to be permitted to make further submissions.

    6. Some comment on nomenclature and language is necessary. Most, if not
       all, of the names of people and places vary in transliteration  from
       the Arabic. We have attempted to adopt a  consistent  spelling.  For
       example, rather than use what may be  the  more  usual  spelling  of
       Colonel Qadhafi as 'Gadaffi', we have opted for the  transliteration
       'Qadhafi', as used by each of the experts  in  their  reports.  When
       quoting from reports we have retained the  transliteration  used  in
       those reports.

    7. The expert evidence of the three witnesses was contained in  several
       written reports and in lengthy oral evidence. In  the  circumstances
       we have considered it appropriate to set out a comprehensive summary
       of the written and oral evidence of the expert witnesses at Appendix
       D, rather than incorporating it into the body of the  determination.
       Nevertheless, we have referred in  detail  to  the  expert  evidence
       within the various sub-headings which we have used as  part  of  our
       analysis of the issues.

    8. We found all three experts to have given well informed and objective
       evidence. That is not to say that in every  respect  their  evidence
       has been accepted without qualification. Where we take the view that
       any difference in emphasis or interpretation of background  evidence
       is called for we have said so in what follows,  and  have  explained
       our reasons for our views.

    9. The agreed issues are as set out below. However, we think it  useful
       on occasion to refine the description of certain categories,  better
       to reflect the evidence and the utility  of  the  guidance  in  this
       determination.

   10. We have at various points referred to the  Home  Office  Operational
       Guidance Note ("OGN") for Libya.  The  OGN's  purpose  is  expressly
       stated to be to provide guidance to Home Office caseworkers  on  the
       nature and handling  of  most  types  of  claims  for  international
       protection from people from Libya. It is a  document  that  contains
       policy guidance as well as purely country background information. In
       considering the OGN we bear in mind the distinction between the two.

THE APPELLANTS

   11. The following are the circumstances in which the appeals come before
       the Upper Tribunal. Further elaboration of the basis of their claims
       is given in paragraphs 217-262, with our assessment of their  claims
       to international protection.

   AT

   12. AT was born on 24 March 1990 in Tripoli, where he lived in Souq  Al-
       Juma'a[2] which was his last address in Libya. He came to the UK  on
       11 March 2011, claiming asylum on arrival. His  appeal  against  the
       respondent's decision of 30 March 2011 to refuse leave to enter  was
       dismissed by a judge of the First-tier Tribunal in  a  determination
       promulgated on 26 May 2011.

   13. Permission to appeal was granted by a Senior Immigration  Judge  (as
       then was) on the  basis  of  the  First-tier  judge's  treatment  of
       Article  15(c)   of   Directive   2004/83/EC   ("the   Qualification
       Directive") in the light of the conflict in Libya at  that  time.  A
       'rule 24' response from the Secretary of State  was  to  the  effect
       that the appeal to the Upper Tribunal was not opposed in  the  sense
       that Article 15(c) would have to be considered afresh.

   14. It does not appear that any formal decision finding an error of  law
       in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal has hitherto  been  made.
       The Directions of the Senior Immigration Judge  merely  acknowledged
       what was conceded by the Secretary of State. Nevertheless, before us
       it was agreed by the parties that there was an error of law  in  the
       First-tier judge's decision in that respect  and  we  so  find.  The
       decision is set aside.

   AMH

   15. AMH was born on 12 December 1970 and is from Zawiye which is said to
       be about 45 minutes drive from Tripoli. He arrived in the UK  on  17
       October 2010 with a valid student visa. He claimed asylum on 18  May
       2011. His appeal against the decision dated 10 June 2011  to  remove
       him to Libya was dismissed by a judge of the First-tier Tribunal  in
       a decision promulgated on  27  September  2011.  Senior  Immigration
       Judge Storey set aside the First-tier judge's decision, having found
       that the First-tier judge erred in law in terms of the assessment of
       risk to the appellant as a "Black Libyan" and in  terms  of  Article
       15(c). The error of law decision is set out at Appendix A.

   HKA

   16. This appellant was born on 6 November 1979, is female and comes from
       Benghazi. She is the sister of AE-S. She arrived  in  the  UK  on  5
       January 2011 as  a  business  visitor.  She  claimed  asylum  on  25
       February 2011. Her appeal against the  decision  to  refuse  further
       leave to remain was dismissed in a decision of a First-tier Tribunal
       Judge promulgated on 12 May 2011. Senior  Immigration  Judge  Storey
       also found an error of law in the First-tier  judge's  determination
       of her appeal, in terms of the potential risk to her in  Tripoli  on
       account of being from Benghazi and of the Ashwihdi  tribe.  He  also
       concluded that the First-tier judge had erred  in  relation  to  his
       conclusion that the appellant would be able to  avoid  the  risk  of
       persecution  because  of  an  apparent   entitlement   to   Egyptian
       nationality. The error of law decision is set out at Appendix B.

   AE-S

   17. AE-S was born on 21 August 1989. He came to the UK at the same  time
       as his sister. He too had a valid visa and also claimed asylum on 25
       February 2011. A decision  was  made  to  refuse  further  leave  to
       remain. His appeal against that decision was heard at the same  time
       as that of HKA and was similarly dismissed.  That  decision  of  the
       First-tier Tribunal was set aside largely for the same reasons as in
       relation to HKA but including in relation to Article 15(c).





THE ISSUES

   18. Following the fall of the regime of Colonel  Qadhafi  there  is  the
       need for a fresh assessment of the country situation in terms of the
       potential risk for those returned there from the UK.  This  decision
       does not purport to cover every  category  of  potential  risk,  but
       considers what appear to be the main categories at the time  of  the
       hearing of the appeals before us. The agreed issues to be determined
       in these appeals are as follows:

        1.   Is a Libyan national at risk of persecution and/or  Article  3
           ill treatment on return to Libya by virtue of all or some of the
           following characteristics:

     a. Those perceived as having been Qadhafi supporters;

           b. Black Libyans (on the basis of  ethnicity  alone,  and/or  as
              perceived Qadhafi supporters);

     c. Women

     d. Failed asylum seekers.

        2. In particular, is there a risk on return arising at the  airport
           and/or on the route of return to Benghazi, Zawiye or  any  other
           part of Libya from Tripoli airport?

        3. Is there a sufficiency of protection  in  respect  of  any  such
        risks?

        4. Is internal relocation available to those at risk?

        5. Is a Black Libyan from Zawiye at risk on return and can he  seek
          protection from the     current regime or internally  relocate  to
          Tripoli or any other part of Libya  and  how  does  he  internally
          relocate to/from Tripoli to another safe area if it exists?

        6.    Is there a high level of indiscriminate violence in Libya  or
          parts of Libya under article       15(c) such that the Appellants
          will be at risk on return?

   SUB-HEADINGS AND CONTEXT

   19. In order to put into context the guidance in this decision  and  our
       conclusions in relation to the appeals of these appellants, we  have
       identified a number of  features  of  the  evidence  which  we  have
       included as sub-headings. That is not to say that other sub-headings
       could not have been included  or  substituted,  but  those  we  have
       selected seem to us to be useful  signposts  on  the  route  to  our
       conclusions.

   Home Office practice/policy on returns

   20. A response to written questions from the appellants in  relation  to
       returns to Libya was provided by the respondent. From these  written
       answers it is apparent that escorted enforced removals to Libya were
       suspended in January 2011 in  response  to  the  unrest  there,  and
       resumed in June 2013. The Home Office's "contractor" is said to have
       undertaken its own risk assessment which was concluded in May  2013.
       There were 11 unescorted returns between January 2011 and  May  2013
       whereby the travel arrangements were made by the Home Office and the
       individuals taking flights to Tripoli without escorts.  All  returns
       are said to have been effected to Tripoli International Airport.

   21. There were 11 enforced returns  between  June  and  August  2013  by
       flight to Tripoli using scheduled airlines. The ethnic background of
       returnees was not monitored;  the  Secretary  of  State's  view  was
       expressed as being that ethnicity would have been considered as part
       of the asylum application and appeal process. The final  destination
       of the returnees was not monitored. Of the seven enforced returns to
       Libya in August 2013, one person originated from Benghazi. As at the
       date of the  written  responses,  there  have  been  three  enforced
       escorted returns since August 2013; one in September 2013 and two in
       October 2013.

   22. Following submissions from Mr Ficklin on behalf of AT, the  position
       in relation to  returns  for  the  periods  referred  to  above  was
       clarified  and  the  written  information  amended  to  reflect  the
       situation as we have recorded it  above.  We  were  informed  by  Mr
       Palmer that between 17 March 2011 and 31 October  2011,  when  there
       was a no-fly zone in operation, returns to Libya were  not  affected
       directly. In  that  period  two  individuals  were  the  subject  of
       enforced return to Italy and four by Tunis Air to Egypt.

   23. Further information was provided in the form of a table  of  returns
       by quarter from the first quarter of 2011 to the  first  quarter  of
       2013 which Mr Palmer suggested meant that previous figures  actually
       underestimated the number of returns. They  did  not  all,  however,
       relate to failed asylum claimants.

   24. We understood that Mr Ficklin's concern was to establish the  extent
       of returns, the basis on which it was decided that returns should no
       longer be suspended, and when the  change  in  policy  took  effect.
       Whilst we accept that these are legitimate avenues  of  enquiry,  in
       the event it was ultimately accepted on behalf of  AT  that  nothing
       now turns on this issue. No submissions on the point  were  made  on
       behalf of the other appellants.

   Militias

   25. There was considerable background and expert evidence before  us  in
       relation to militias in Libya. Indeed, no assessment of risk to  any
       particular  group  or  individual  could   be   undertaken   without
       consideration of the role of militias in present day Libya.

   26. In summary, there are various militias of various  sizes.  Estimates
       for the number of militias vary. A report of October 2013 from Voice
       of America News refers to  "thousands"  of  militias  "roaming"  the
       country,  estimated  to  number  about  200,000.  We  interpret  the
       "thousands" of militias as an estimate of the number of individuals,
       rather than the number of groups, given the context.

   27. Professor Joff� said that the conventional answer is that there  are
       about 350 militias but it depended on how "militia" is  defined.  Dr
       George said that he had seen a figure of 1,700  given  recently.  No
       doubt this variation reflects Professor Joff�'s comment in  relation
       to the definition of militia and the evidence that  checkpoints  can
       suddenly emerge to deal with a local and instant issue. The evidence
       suggests that some militias plainly have an established or continued
       presence, whilst others arise from time to time in response to local
       events. Dr Porter's written evidence was that  local  militias  have
       clearly demarcated territories.

   28. The militias, to varying degrees, work on behalf of  the  government
       or various government departments, with  Libya  Shield[3]  being  an
       organisation set up by the government to co-opt militias to  act  on
       its behalf and which has links to  the  Defence  Ministry,  and  the
       Supreme Security Committee ("SSC")[4] having links with the Interior
       Ministry. The UN Support Mission in  Libya  ("UNSMIL")  report  also
       refers to armed brigades not affiliated to any ministry. The  report
       refers on page 4 to a range of detention facilities  some  of  which
       are fully or partly under the "authority"  of  armed  brigades  that
       have been brought within various government  ministries,  and  those
       that are run entirely by armed brigades with no formal connection to
       any State institution and no control by the government.

   29. Dr Porter's written evidence was that some of  the  larger  militias
       such as those from Zintan and Misrata  have  been  enlisted  by  the
       government to function as proxies for  a  national  security  force.
       Each has aircraft at their disposal as well  as  military  vehicles,
       including  tanks,  and  each  has  several  thousand  members.  Some
       militias are in the pay of different ministries  and  are  involved,
       for example, in oilfield or airport security.

   30. The evidence is to the effect that the militias have  varied  (self)
       interests, loyalties and priorities which  may,  and  sometimes  may
       not, coincide with the interests of the  government.  Some  militias
       provide law  enforcement  services  on  behalf  of  the  government,
       protect airports or other installations. The extent  to  which  they
       are disciplined internally also  varies.  Dr  George  described  the
       militias as ill-disciplined. He also said,  however,  that  not  all
       militias are out of control and have quite sophisticated command and
       control structures and organised hierarchies. It does not mean  that
       they are highly disciplined but they are not totally out of control.
       Dr Porter said that whilst the militias operate outside or above the
       law they do not  behave  in  an  undisciplined  manner  and  exhibit
       sophisticated command and control. The leadership is  known  to  the
       public and there are clear hierarchies.



   Checkpoints

   31. We found  the  evidence  from  all  three  experts  in  relation  to
       checkpoints extremely informative and helpful.  Professor  Joff�  in
       his latest report referred to militias often having  more  than  one
       objective,  often  becoming  involved  in  crime  and   increasingly
       charging protection money as a tax at checkpoints, especially  going
       south to Sepah. Whether there are checkpoints on the way  to  Zawiye
       varies depending on the activities of the local militia.  He  stated
       that there are checkpoints outside the airport on  the  approach  to
       Tripoli and there could be checkpoints inside  the  town  of  Zawiye
       itself. Both Professor Joff� and Dr George stated  that  checkpoints
       can  suddenly  pop  up,  with  Dr  George  having  experienced  that
       phenomenon first hand.

   32. Dr Porter's written evidence was  to  the  effect  that  checkpoints
       exist on all major roads out of Tripoli, as well as  between  cities
       and at the entry points to towns and cities.  His  evidence  of  his
       latest visit in August 2013 revealed that there is a lot of  traffic
       on Libyan roads, going through the checkpoints, and that traffic was
       in fact  a  problem.  He  and  his  colleague  passed  through  five
       checkpoints and his colleague told him that he did not know who  was
       manning the checkpoints as they were never stopped.

   33. Whether a person  is  stopped  at  a  checkpoint  can  be  based  on
       arbitrary or non-arbitrary factors but which may be unknown to those
       attempting to pass through. Dr Porter cited examples  of  stops  and
       searches for drugs, alcohol or merely a bribe,  with  procedures  at
       checkpoints often being ad hoc. Dr George said that  to  answer  the
       question why someone such as AT would be stopped at a checkpoint  he
       would have to be highly speculative: someone looking nervous may  be
       enough. Earlier he said that in the case of the uneducated  teenager
       with a Kalashnikov manning a checkpoint, it may depend on whether he
       is in a good mood or likes your face. We  heard  evidence  that  the
       militias  who  man  the  checkpoints  have  their  own  agendas  and
       loyalties.

   Transport/travel

   34. There are certain travel restrictions in place. There  is  a  closed
       military zone in the south of the country and difficulties with land
       border crossings (Home Office Operational Guidance Note for May 2013
       from 2.3.4). In his report of 14 October 2013 Dr Porter states  that
       it was recommended that  individuals  fly  between  cities  wherever
       possible.

   35. He also states in his written evidence that Benghazi residents,  who
       have different  accents  from  those  from  Tripoli,  travel  freely
       throughout the country, including  in  Tripoli.  Some  Libyans  from
       Benghazi live in Tripoli unmolested.

   (i)     Road travel

   36. Again, Dr Porter goes on to state  that  road  travel  in  2013  has
       improved and it is now feasible to travel by car throughout most  of
       the country. Driving from Tripoli  to  Benghazi  is  "prohibitively"
       long but feasible. He referred to the  risk  on  the  roads  out  of
       Tripoli as being related to the uncertainty of the road  conditions,
       the possibility of harassment from militias  and  general  banditry,
       albeit that the risk from any of these is not exceptionally high but
       is amplified  by  the  lack  of  any  national  security  agency  or
       emergency help.

   37. When dealing with the question of travel for women, Dr Porter states
       in his latest report that it would be recommended  that  HKA  travel
       overland in the company of other women or men. She would be able  to
       hire a taxi or take a bus from  Tripoli  to  Benghazi.  The  journey
       could take well over 15 hours.

   (ii) Air travel

   38. Airports have been forced to close from time to time and there  have
       been clashes around Tripoli airport. In November 2013 Etihad Airways
       had temporarily suspended flights to Tripoli because of "safety  and
       operational  challenges",  with  concerns  being   expressed   about
       conditions at Tripoli airport. Dr George said that the real power at
       Tripoli  airport  lies  with  the  Zintan  militias,   a   nominally
       government force (although Dr Porter's written evidence is that  the
       Misrata militia under the guise of  the  Tripoli  Airport  Authority
       were, until recently, in control). Professor Joff� also said that he
       thought that Tripoli airport was under the  control  of  the  Zintan
       militia.

   39. Dr Porter's evidence was that Tripoli and Benghazi airports are  for
       the most part safe and secure and there is little  immediate  danger
       flying into them, or transiting them. Airport security  is  reliable
       and safe well into the night, with passengers coming and going after
       midnight and into the dawn hours.  He referred to  airport  security
       manning checkpoints on airport access roads and around the perimeter
       of the airfield, and screening checkpoints at the  entrance  to  the
       airport, albeit that such  checkpoints  are  rudimentary  and  often
       staffed by untrained personnel. Professor Joff� also  gave  evidence
       that there are checkpoints outside the airport on  the  approach  to
       it. Dr Porter  referred  to  unidentified  militia  members  at  the
       airport in some kind of official capacity.

   40. Continuing with Dr Porter's evidence, he states in his latest report
       that Tripoli airport is  the  main  entry  point  for  flights  from
       Europe, being served by numerous international  carriers,  including
       British Airways, Alitalia, Air France and Lufthansa. Flights operate
       with a reasonable degree of regularity, although unexplained  delays
       and cancellations frequently occur. There are  direct  flights  from
       Heathrow three times a week. Until May 2012 security was provided by
       the Zintan militia at Tripoli airport. It is currently controlled by
       Tripoli International Airport Authority and staff  are  the  Airport
       Authority employees. In reality, security has  been  taken  over  by
       members of the Misrata militia who are now in official uniforms  and
       on the payroll of the Airport Authority. In further evidence he said
       that the Misrata militia had ostensibly withdrawn from  the  airport
       over  the  most  recent  weekend  following  a  confrontation   with
       demonstrators.

   41. Benina (Benghazi) International airport  is  a  secondary  point  of
       entry to the country, largely serving as a domestic  airport.  There
       are no direct flights from the UK but direct transfer  from  Tripoli
       airport is possible. For the  most  part  it  is  free  of  security
       concerns according to Dr Porter's written evidence. In oral evidence
       he said that  he  did  not  know  who  controlled  Benghazi  airport
       although it could be Ansar Sharia[5] or Libya Shield (see footnote 3
       on page 13). He went on to say that few westerners have travelled to
       Benghazi in the last several months because the  security  situation
       is precarious. He was not aware of any incidents at Benghazi airport
       since 2012, and local newspapers would carry any such reports.

   42. Mitiga airport no longer services inbound flights from Europe  apart
       from in exceptional circumstances. It serves regional  international
       carriers.

   43. Dr Porter's latest report states that  questions  posed  to  Libyans
       returning from abroad include reasons for  travel,  length  of  stay
       abroad and reasons for return, but generally there are no  questions
       from the customs and border officers about political affiliation  or
       participation  in  the  revolution.  Nevertheless,  individuals  are
       occasionally singled out for interrogation,  and  return  without  a
       Libyan passport would be grounds for further questioning,  as  would
       travel to sub-Saharan Africa  and  the  Saharan  states.  Travel  to
       European countries and the US does not provoke suspicion. There  may
       be animosity to those who, in  Europe  or  the  US,  'sat  out'  the
       revolution, but this has not been a basis for persecution. Dr Porter
       states that there have been no reported instances of returnees being
       detained by airport authorities or militias on leaving the  airport.
       In oral evidence he said that he did not know whether  the  Ministry
       of the Interior dictates to the customs and  border  officials  what
       questions to ask of travellers at the airport.

   44. We heard evidence from Dr Porter as to the procedures for passengers
       arriving at Tripoli  airport,  with  passengers  being  required  to
       complete a form with their name,  date  of  birth,  nationality  and
       local address. He knew of  those  procedures  because  he  had  gone
       through them when he visited and as far as he knew everyone  had  to
       undergo the same process.

   45. Professor Joff� said that in relation to Tripoli airport, he was not
       saying that  it  was  unsafe  to  pass  through,  as  people  do  so
       regularly. His view was that the issue is one  of  unpredictability,
       given that it is militarily controlled. Benghazi  airport  was  more
       unsafe because of the struggle for control of it. He agreed  that  a
       number of airlines serve Tripoli airport. He referred to  Air  Malta
       having daily flights to Tripoli airport and BA four times a week.

   46. Professor Joff�'s latest report  describes  the  attempt  by  Libyan
       special forces to control Tripoli  airport  against  skirmishing  by
       different groups. In oral evidence he said  that  he  has  not  come
       across much information in relation to  the  security  situation  at
       Benghazi airport. It is controlled by Libyan special forces who  are
       under constant pressure from groups who previously controlled it and
       who want to get it back as it was a lucrative opportunity.

   Family book

   47. The background evidence in relation to the family book  (let)  comes
       from the OGN  at  3.12.10,  describing  it  as  the  main  proof  of
       citizenship, listing family members and being required, for example,
       to obtain employment or take out a loan from  a  bank.  Tuaregs  who
       have been  in  the  country  for  decades  have  been  denied  them.
       Professor Joff� described the family book as an  essential  document
       and duplicates are  unobtainable.  It  is  required,  amongst  other
       things,  to  obtain   residence   and   registration   through   the
       municipality and the police. We also understood him to say  that  it
       is needed to obtain an identity card and/or passport, without  which
       all Libyans  risk  arrest.  Militias,  he  said,  arbitrarily  check
       identification  and  detain  those  who  do   not   possess   proper
       identification.

   48. However, he said that many people may have lost  their  family  book
       given the situation in the country. There is  no  greater  risk  for
       people returning from the UK in terms of lacking possession  of  the
       family book, he said.

   SUFFICIENCY OF PROTECTION

   49. Given the circumstances currently existing in Libya, the sources  of
       potential risk to certain categories of people, and the  prospective
       sources of protection, it is  as  well  to  consider  the  issue  of
       sufficiency of protection at this  point,  before  consideration  of
       specific individuals or groups.

   Sufficiency of protection-general principles

   50. Council Directive 2004/83/EC ("the Directive") in Article  7  states
       as follows in relation to "Actors of protection":

          Article 7

          Actors of protection

        1. Protection can be provided by:

          (a) the State; or

           (b)  the  parties  or  organisations,  including   international
          organisations, controlling the State or a substantial part of  the
          territory of the State.

        2.   Protection is generally provided when the actors mentioned in
        paragraph 1 take reasonable steps to prevent  the  persecution  or
        suffering of serious harm, inter alia, by  operating  an  effective
        legal system for the detection, prosecution and punishment of  acts
        constituting persecution or serious harm,  and  the  applicant  has
        access to such protection.

        3.   When assessing whether an international organisation controls
        a State or  a  substantial  part  of  its territory  and  provides
        protection as described in paragraph 2, Member States  shall  take
        into account any guidance which may be provided in relevant Council
        acts.

   51. We note the difference in  the  wording  between  the  Directive  in
       Article 7 and  The  Refugee  or  Person  in  Need  of  International
       Protection (Qualification) Regulations 2006 at  Regulation  4  ("the
       Qualification Regulations"). Article 7  states  that  protection  is
       generally provided when the actors mentioned  in  paragraph 1  take
       reasonable steps to prevent the persecution or suffering of  serious
       harm, "inter alia, by operating an effective legal  system  for  the
       detection" etc (emphasis  as  in  original).  Regulation  4  of  the
       Qualification Regulations is almost identical but the  words  "inter
       alia" are omitted. It is suggested in Macdonald's Immigration Law  &
       Practice Eighth Edition Vol. 1 at page 864, that the operation of an
       effective legal system becomes, in  the  Regulations,  a  sufficient
       condition for the provision of protection, whereas in the  Directive
       it is a necessary but not necessarily sufficient condition  for  the
       provision of protection.

   52. For present purposes the apparent difference between  the  Directive
       and the Qualification Regulations is not a difference that seems  to
       us to be material to the issues we have to determine. As we  observe
       below, however, the extent  to  which  the  circumstances  in  Libya
       reflect the provisions of Article 7 (or Regulation 4) is relevant.

   53. In Horvath [2000] UKHL 37 it was decided that:

             "The standard to be applied is therefore not that  which  would
             eliminate all risk and would thus  amount  to  a  guarantee  of
             protection  in  the  home  state.  Rather  it  is  a  practical
             standard, which takes proper account  of  the  duty  which  the
             state owes to all its own nationals."

       (And see also Bagdanavicius [2003] EWCA Civ 1605;  and  [2005]  UKHL
       38).

   54. In AW (Sufficiency of protection) Pakistan  [2011]  UKUT  31  (IAC),
       referring to the decision of the Court of Appeal  in  Bagdanavicius,
       the  Tribunal   emphasised  the  need  to  consider  the  individual
       circumstances of a particular appellant, notwithstanding that it may
       be found that there is a general  sufficiency  of  protection  in  a
       particular country (see [24] and [25] of AW).

   55. We were referred to the decision of the  ECJ  in  Abdulla  (Case  C-
       175/08) (and other appellants), in particular [70]-[76] as follows:
         "70  In order to arrive at the conclusion that the  refugee's  fear
             of being persecuted is no longer well  founded,  the  competent
             authorities, by reference to Article  7(2)  of  the  Directive,
             must  verify,  having  regard  to  the   refugee's   individual
             situation, that the actor or actors of protection of the  third
             country in question have taken reasonable steps to prevent  the
             persecution,  that  they  therefore  operate,  inter  alia,  an
             effective legal  system  for  the  detection,  prosecution  and
             punishment  of  acts  constituting  persecution  and  that  the
             national concerned will have access to such  protection  if  he
             ceases to have refugee status.

        71      That verification means that the competent authorities must
             assess, in particular, the conditions of operation of,  on  the
             one hand, the institutions,  authorities  and  security  forces
             and, on the other, all groups or bodies of  the  third  country
             which may, by their action or inaction, be responsible for acts
             of persecution against the recipient of refugee  status  if  he
             returns to that country. In accordance with Article 4(3) of the
             Directive,  relating   to   the   assessment   of   facts   and
             circumstances, those authorities may take into  account,  inter
             alia, the laws and regulations of the country of origin and the
             manner in which they are applied, and the extent to which basic
             human rights are guaranteed in that country.

        72      Furthermore, Article 11(2) of the Directive provides  that
             the  change  of  circumstances  recorded   by   the   competent
             authorities must be 'of such a  significant  and  non-temporary
             nature' that the refugee's fear of persecution can no longer be
             regarded as well founded....

         74     It must be  pointed  out  that  the  actor  or  actors  of
             protection with respect to which the reality  of  a  change  of
             circumstances in the country of origin is to be  assessed  are,
             under Article 7(1) of the Directive, either the State itself or
             the   parties   or   organisations,   including   international
             organisations, controlling the State or a substantial  part  of
             the territory of the State.

        76      In view of all the foregoing considerations, the answer to
             the first question is that Article 11(1)(e) of the Directive is
             to be interpreted as meaning that:

        -        refugee status ceases to exist when, having regard  to  a
             change of circumstances  of  a  significant  and  non-temporary
             nature in the third country concerned, the circumstances  which
             justified the person's fear  of  persecution  for  one  of  the
             reasons referred to in Article 2(c) of the  Directive,  on  the
             basis of which refugee status was granted, no longer exist  and
             that person has no other  reason  to  fear  being  'persecuted'
             within the meaning of Article 2(c) of the Directive;

        -        for the purposes of assessing a change of  circumstances,
             the competent authorities of  the  Member  State  must  verify,
             having regard to the refugee's individual situation,  that  the
             actor or actors of protection referred to in  Article  7(1)  of
             the Directive  have  taken  reasonable  steps  to  prevent  the
             persecution,  that  they  therefore  operate,  inter  alia,  an
             effective legal  system  for  the  detection,  prosecution  and
             punishment  of  acts  constituting  persecution  and  that  the
             national concerned will have access to such  protection  if  he
             ceases to have refugee status;

        -        the actors of protection referred to in Article 7(1)(b) of
             the  Directive   may   comprise   international   organisations
             controlling the State or a substantial part of the territory of
             the  State,  including  by  means  of   the   presence   of   a
             multinational force in that territory."


   56. Abdulla  is  a  decision  that  concerns  Article  11(1)(e)  of  the
       Directive (cessation) and so is not directly relevant to the  issues
       this Tribunal has to determine. We do however, consider that what is
       said about actors of protection is a useful reminder of  factors  to
       be considered when assessing sufficiency of protection.

   A functioning legal and judicial system?

   57. We have seen the extent to which the government in Libya relies  for
       its functions on the various militias, to provide security  and  law
       enforcement duties. The limitations of such  reliance  in  terms  of
       adherence to accepted human rights norms, including due process, can
       be discerned from our summaries of distinct features of life in post-
       revolutionary Libya, viz. militias, checkpoints and travel, as  well
       as in our review of the background evidence (see Appendix G).

   58. It is uncontentious that the (government) military and police  force
       remain weak. That concession is made in  the  Secretary  of  State's
       skeleton argument, although again that blunt assessment  is  subject
       to refinements in terms of the extent to which the militias are,  or
       are not, disciplined and organised.

   59. We can turn to the US State Department Report  for  Libya  ("USSDR")
       dated April 2013 for its assessment of the  situation  in  terms  of
       effective judicial capability. Thus, we read  on  page  1  that  the
       government lacked the capacity and basic legal framework to  protect
       civil and judicial rights fully. With regard to the courts there  is
       a:

             "lack of enforcement capability,  lack  of  competency  of  the
             courts, and confusion over the applicability  of  new  and  old
             laws.... The most significant human  rights  problems  resulted
             from  the   absence   of   effective   justice   and   security
             institutions.... The new government fell short of  establishing
             a consistent rule of law."

   60. The USSDR continues that:

             "Other important human rights abuses  included:  arbitrary  and
             unlawful killings, including politically motivated killings  by
             groups outside government  control;  kidnappings;  torture  and
             other cruel, inhuman, or  degrading  treatment  or  punishment;
             harsh and life-threatening conditions in detention  and  prison
             facilities, some of which were illegal;  arbitrary  arrest  and
             detention; lengthy pretrial detention; denial  of  fair  public
             trial; an ineffective judicial system  staffed  by  intimidated
             judicial authorities...."

       Further, in relation to accountability and the effectiveness of  the
       judiciary it is stated that:

     "Impunity was a serious problem.  Although  militias  detained  abusive
             Qadhafi-era officials, the scarcely functioning criminal courts
             struggled to try them, and when they  did  attempt  to  conduct
             trials, judges often faced threats of  violence.  In  the  same
             vein, with the judiciary not fully functioning, the  government
             had  not  taken  concrete  steps  by  year's  end  to   advance
             transitional justice.  There  were  rarely  investigations  and
             still fewer prosecutions of those believed  to  have  committed
             abuses."

   61. In summarising the written evidence of Dr George  we  note  that  he
       stated, under the heading "Local protection", that he  knows  of  no
       evidential basis that would support an assertion that  a  person  in
       need of protection in Libya could expect effective  assistance  from
       the local authorities (de jure and de facto), there being as yet  no
       effective national police force or army and with the judicial system
       being "non-functional".

   62. In response to the written questions from  the  Secretary  of  State
       about the judicial  system,  whilst  standing  by  what  is  in  his
       previous reports, he states that disparate elements of the system do
       function in an ad  hoc  manner,  with  geographical  variations  and
       variations in the specific  area  of  judicial  activity.   However,
       there  is  no  "coherent,  reliable,  nationally-effective  judicial
       system". Thus, he concludes that the  judicial  system  is  in  that
       general sense "non-functional".

   63. In relation to the International Criminal Court's  ("ICC")  decision
       of 11 October 2013 that Libya  was  not  unable  to  carry  out  the
       prosecution of Abdullah Al-Senussi (Colonel  Qadhafi's  Director  of
       Intelligence), this in Dr George's view does not constitute  support
       for  the  contention  that  Libya  has  a  coherent,  reliable   and
       nationally effective judicial system. His view is that there  is  no
       reason to doubt that the particular legal facilities  that  are  the
       subject of the Al-Senussi case are  functioning  in  a  manner  that
       satisfied  the  ICC.  Equally,  however,  that   could   easily   be
       interrupted if a sufficiently powerful local militia  had  cause  to
       intervene. He cites the example of the prime  minister  having  been
       abducted and detained on 10 October 2013.

   64. As regards the decision that all 31 Qadhafi era officials are to  be
       committed for trial, he states again that there is  no  dispute  but
       that certain courts are functioning in Libya. However,  he  suggests
       that it is crucial to note that one of those officials is  Saif  al-
       Islam, Colonel Qadhafi's eldest son who remains in detention by  the
       local Zintan militia. He cites a press report which  indicates  that
       Saif al-Islam was not delivered to any  of  the  pre-trial  hearings
       despite his captors being ordered to produce him.

   65. Our summary of the written evidence  of  Dr  Porter  refers  to  his
       having said that  there  is  no  effective  policing  capability  by
       uniformed officers under the  authority  of  national  or  municipal
       institutions. Faced with the overwhelming firepower of militias  and
       the widespread availability of weapons among the general population,
       the official police cannot guarantee protection for individuals, nor
       can they provide  recourse  for  individuals  who  have  encountered
       problems. To secure  protection  individuals  can  turn  to  militia
       leadership and declare their support for the militia.

   66. Dr Porter's answers to the respondent's written questions  were  not
       materially different from those of Dr George.  He  states  that  the
       ICC report in relation to Al-Senussi is evidence of the vagaries  of
       the Libyan justice system, in particular the possibility that  Libya
       would be unable to provide Al-Senussi with legal counsel. The  ICC's
       decision also potentially reveals the politicisation of the  justice
       system. His view is that Al-Senussi's  circumstances  are  far  from
       representative. It is unlikely that a less well-known  figure  would
       be treated in a similar manner, he suggests.

   67. He also states that the fact that the Court is unable to compel  the
       captors of the 31 Qadhafi era officials to bring them  to  court  is
       evidence that there is no effective judiciary. The militias  largely
       do as they please. The Zintan militia holding Saif al-Islam did  not
       bring him to the pre-trial hearing although it had agreed to do  so,
       and the Tripoli court has no power to compel the militia to do so.

   68. Professor Joff�'s written evidence was that the State is not able to
       provide adequate protection to its own  nationals.  He  writes  that
       even though a few army units have been deployed, their authority  is
       challenged by Libyan Shield forces. There  is  no  effective  police
       force outside the SSC units which, like Libyan Shield,  are  militia
       based. Both organisations are not under proper civilian control  and
       both engage in arbitrary arrest and detention.

   69. Lastly, in terms of background evidence we refer again  to  the  OGN
       which at 2.2.6 states that the authorities struggled to establish  a
       functioning  military  and  police  force  that  could  enforce  and
       maintain law and order. Many of the armed groups refused  to  disarm
       and filled the security void. Some cooperated  with  the  government
       and  provided  security  services.  Others  operated  without  state
       sanction. At 2.2.9 the OGN states that  the  police  force  remained
       weak and depended largely on the SSC for  ensuring  law  and  order,
       although the SSC's lack  of  vetting  criteria  and  scant  training
       contributed to abuse by its members.

   70. The judicial system is stated  in  the  OGN  to  remain  weak,  with
       threats and attacks on prosecutors and judges further inhibiting the
       rule of law. There are  some  functioning  courts  in  city  centres
       trying ordinary cases. An estimate of  9,000  persons  is  given  in
       relation to the number of those in government  or  military  custody
       without any formal trial or sentencing, although  later  at  3.10.14
       the estimated figure is given as 7,000.

   71. The conclusion at 2.2.17 is that:

             "The current  limitations  of  Libya's  legal  system  for  the
             detection, prosecution  and  punishment  of  acts  constituting
             persecution or serious harm  mean  that  in  general  claimants
             would not always be able to access effective protection."

   Sufficiency of protection-conclusions

   72. We refer at various points to the  evidence  of  the  importance  in
       Libyan society of families, extended families and ethnic groups. The
       situation currently in Libya is that of a highly decentralised state
       in which the primary sources of protection  are  localised,  through
       family and tribe. In these circumstances, and given the need to take
       a factual approach,  we  are  satisfied  that  there  is  a  general
       sufficiency of protection for the  ordinary  citizen.  However,  the
       evidence is that for those in certain categories there will not be a
       sufficiency of protection.

   73. We are in partial agreement with the proposition in the respondent's
       skeleton argument to the effect that there will be cases  where  the
       lack of central state control over the militia and  the  limitations
       of Libya's legal system have the result that asylum claimants  would
       not always be able to access effective protection. However,  in  our
       view the evidence goes further. Rather than the  emphasis  being  on
       individuals "not always" being able to access effective  protection,
       we consider that the evidence establishes  that  an  individual  who
       succeeds in establishing a 'risk profile' will, in general,  not  be
       afforded a sufficiency of protection.

   74. That view takes account of the fact that the risk to a returnee  may
       often arise from the militias who in many cases have  been  given  a
       mandate from the government to undertake law enforcement  functions.
       There is  evidence  of  a  large  number  of  detainees  in  various
       facilities and to a greater or lesser degree under  the  control  of
       the government. There is significant evidence  of  ill-treatment  of
       those detained. A person detained as a suspected  former  member  of
       the Qadhafi intelligence services may provide  a  good  example.  We
       cannot see that  the  evidence  supports  the  proposition  that  in
       general such an individual would be able  to  seek  protection  from
       government if detained by a militia operating independently  of  the
       government, or even one acting under the ostensible authority of the
       government.

   75. We do not rule out the possibility that there may be cases  where  a
       person who would otherwise be at risk would be  afforded  sufficient
       protection. That however, represents a recognition of  the  need  to
       assess each individual  case  on  the  basis  of  the  circumstances
       relating to that individual. Again, to take a hypothetical  example;
       a very high profile figure in the former regime  could  be  returned
       with specific arrangements in place which do reach the threshold  of
       sufficiency  of  protection,  although  taking  into  account   that
       international law cannot provide a guarantee of safety.

   76. In giving these examples, however, we do not suggest that the use of
       a phrase  such as "very high profile" is to be taken as any sort  of
       yardstick or  test,  or  that  there  would  need  to  be  competing
       arguments as to whether a person comes within the  meaning  of  that
       phrase. It is an example which, no more and no less, illustrates the
       need to assess each individual  case  on  its  own  merits,  in  the
       context of our general conclusion that, an individual  who  succeeds
       in establishing a 'risk profile' will, in general, not be afforded a
       sufficiency of protection.

   Protection by militia

   77. A question arose in terms of whether a person who is at risk from  a
       particular  militia  could  rely  on  another  militia  to   provide
       protection, or whether a person who is subject to a particular  risk
       locally could achieve such protection.

   78. To some extent, the  question  has  been  answered  in  our  general
       conclusions in relation to sufficiency of protection. However,  even
       more so than already indicated, a  highly  individual  and  specific
       risk (beyond, say, that arising in relation to a former high ranking
       official within the previous regime's intelligence services or to  a
       person in one of the  other  identified  risk  categories  described
       below) requires a highly fact-specific  analysis  which  takes  into
       account a range of factors. Evidence from Dr Porter  was  that  some
       militias are allied to each  other;  not  all  are  hostile  to  one
       another. He said that to secure protection individuals can  turn  to
       militia leadership and declare their support for the militia. On the
       other hand, he said in evidence that he does not  know  how  someone
       would secure protection in Tripoli if not from that  area.  We  note
       from Dr George that families, extended families, and  religious  and
       ethnic groups form the basis of Libyan society.

   79. Apart from the obvious personal factors such as  the  person's  age,
       status and background, it will be important to  consider  where  the
       risk is said to emanate from, whether it be from an individual  with
       no reach other than in a particular  locality,  or  from  a  militia
       group  with  a  more  extensive  reach  and  perhaps  with  a  close
       connection to the government. In the case of a risk said to be  from
       a particular militia, the assessment of risk takes  account  of  the
       circumstances that currently exist in terms of the extent  to  which
       the government relies on militias to perform various security or law
       enforcement functions.

   80. That is not to  say  that  a  person  who  alleges  a  risk  from  a
       particular militia that has a link to the government will be able to
       establish entitlement to international protection simply because  of
       that link. The militia in question may be only loosely connected  to
       the government or may perform a function on behalf of the government
       only in a particular area. This again illustrates the need in such a
       case for a highly fact-specific enquiry.

   81. There may be cases where an individual could look to the  protection
       of a militia where there is reason to believe that that person would
       be protected, for example because of a family or tribal  link  to  a
       particular militia. We have  considerable  misgivings,  however,  in
       adopting or endorsing an approach that embraces Dr Porter's evidence
       of a person being able to  achieve  protection  by  turning  to  the
       militia leadership and declaring their support for that militia,  in
       the absence of any evidence in a given case that such a  declaration
       is feasible and would achieve the objective of securing  protection.



   INTERNAL RELOCATION

   82. Whether a person would be able to relocate to another part of  Libya
       where they would be free from the risk of harm and where it would be
       reasonable to expect them to go must be answered  in  terms  of  the
       principles derived from the decision in AH (Sudan)  v  Secretary  of
       State [2007] UKHL 49 where Lord Bingham referred to what he had said
       in Januzi v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2006]  UKHL
       5, namely that:

             "The   decision-maker,   taking   account   of   all   relevant
             circumstances pertaining to the claimant  and  his  country  of
             origin, must decide whether it  is  reasonable  to  expect  the
             claimant to relocate or whether it would  be  unduly  harsh  to
             expect him to do so....  There is,  as  Simon  Brown  LJ  aptly
             observed in Svazas v Secretary of State for the Home Department
             [2001] 1 WLR 1891, para 55, a spectrum of cases.  The decision-
             maker must do his best  to  decide,  on  such  material  as  is
             available, where on the spectrum the particular case falls  ...
             or must depend on a fair assessment of the relevant facts [5]."

   83. For those in the risk categories that we have identified below we do
       not consider that there would be a viable  alternative  of  internal
       relocation as a means of avoiding the risk of harm. Whilst, for  the
       reasons we have given, we consider that it is possible to travel  by
       road or air in  Libya,  both  for  men  and  women,  the  reasonable
       likelihood of being stopped at a checkpoint means that it could  not
       be ruled out that a person's background will be discovered en  route
       to the destination and at the point of being stopped  a  risk  would
       arise.

   84. In addition, we have regard  to  the  evidence  of  Dr  George  that
       attitudes to former members of Qadhafi's security  agencies  do  not
       vary from one part of Libya to another. It seems to us that the same
       attitude is reasonably likely to prevail in respect of others in the
       risk categories we have identified, for example Tawurgans,  who  are
       at risk because of their actual or perceived  association  with  the
       former regime.

   85. In  relation  to  others  who  are  able  to  establish  a  risk  of
       persecution or Article 3 harm in a particular locality (and  against
       which they cannot effectively be protected) it is as  well  to  note
       that there was little specific evidence before us of who else, apart
       from the groups we have considered, this could  encompass.  However,
       there is sufficient evidence of the current situation, including the
       fact that Libya is  in  a  post  revolutionary  phase,  taking  into
       account issues of revenge, lawlessness and criminality, to  envisage
       that an  individual  may  be  able  make  out  a  case  for  fearing
       proscribed ill-treatment in a particular area.

   86. We have already given our conclusions in terms of the possibility of
       travel within Libya, those conclusions being plainly relevant to the
       question of whether a person at risk in one area could safely travel
       to another. Depending on the facts, for the reasons we  have  given,
       we consider that it is in the main viable for a person to be able to
       travel to another area to seek safety.

   87. The route to 'safety' is, however, of potential relevance, depending
       on the facts. This is because of the reasonably likelihood of  being
       stopped at a checkpoint or otherwise, by a militia. Thus,  a  person
       at risk in a particular town or city  may  not  be  able  to  access
       safety in another part of the country because a militia that he  has
       a well founded fear of  controls  the  entry  and  exit  routes.  Of
       course, in that instance the issue of internal relocation  would  in
       fact be purely academic since the risk would in fact  arise  on  the
       route home (see HH (Somalia) [2010] EWCA Civ 426).

   88. In another case, however, an individual may  be  able  to  establish
       that he would not be able to reach an alternative  location  because
       the evidence establishes, for example, that a militia from whom  the
       risk arises would be encountered by  him  en  route  from  his  home
       location. This could conceivably arise where the evidence is to  the
       effect that the particular militia controls, or has a presence in, a
       particular area.

   89. There was some inconsistency in the evidence in terms of the  extent
       to which an  individual  would  be  able,  in  practical  terms,  to
       establish him or herself in a locality that  is  not  that  person's
       home area. Dr George's written evidence was  that  in  recent  years
       tribalism, whilst still important, has become less significant  than
       it had been in the past. He goes on to state that  while  particular
       tribes have traditional territories  where  they  are  the  dominant
       element in the population, most if not all Libyan communities have a
       populace that is at least to  some  extent  mixed.  In  the  largest
       cities a significant proportion of the population never belonged  to
       any tribe. On the other hand, it is stated that  with  the  uprising
       against the Qadhafi regime there has been a  general  resurgence  of
       primordial  loyalties  to  family,  clan,  tribe  and  locality.  He
       continues, that the tribe and extended family, or clan,  remain  the
       key social, economic and political units to  whom  loyalty  lies  in
       preference to the state.

   90. Dr George also wrote that families, extended families, religious and
       ethnic groups form the basis of Libyan society and  people  in  such
       communities display a strong tendency to live together in relatively
       well-defined districts, looking to their immediate  communities  for
       social, economic and political support. Against that  background  he
       states that "it is neither the general practice nor is it  easy  for
       individuals to relocate to parts of Libya  remote  from  members  of
       their families and communities." People tend to  know  their  fellow
       residents and  newcomers  attract  attention.  Residents  and  local
       militias tend to be curious about the background of newcomers and to
       ask questions.

   91. He concludes that by means of tribal contacts a pursuer  can  locate
       his quarry with relative ease. In this respect he refers  to  Libyan
       clans often being allied with  others,  forming  intricate  networks
       that can extend over large areas and  will  often  have  members  in
       widely disparate locations. Individuals can  be  located  relatively
       easily because of the nature of Libyan society and newcomers  to  an
       area cannot easily live anonymously.

   92. On the other hand, in oral evidence he said that  residents  of  the
       cities, including Tripoli, are migrants from particular areas.  They
       tend to conglomerate but there is more mixing than in the  villages.
       People do, however, know who  is  in  their  neighbourhood.  He  had
       checked last year in a suburb for  the  relatives  of  a  particular
       asylum applicant. The  local  people  knew  exactly  who  they  were
       talking about. In Tripoli the  population  is,  however,  much  more
       fluid; not the same as in poorer parts of the country.

   93. People from Benghazi do live in Tripoli. He said that  he  does  not
       know, however, whether they live in discrete communities and is  not
       aware of any studies having been undertaken in relation to this.  On
       this issue Dr Porter also said that it is very hard to believe  that
       an individual from Benghazi would have no point of  contact  in  the
       capital given the intimacy and the small size of Libyan society.

   94. It would be unusual for anyone to come to  Tripoli  without  knowing
       anyone, he said. When he goes to Tripoli he makes sure that  he  has
       contacts in place. Someone going to Tripoli without going through  a
       network would be noteworthy but this has to be put into context.  If
       a person is in a small village and says that they come from such and
       such a place in Tripoli, someone in the village would  know  someone
       and be  able  to  find  out  about  that  person.  Cities  are  more
       anonymous.  In  the  suburbs  of  Tripoli  the  curiosity  would  be
       intensified as in insecure situations this could be a matter of life
       and death.  He is not able  to  answer  as  to  whether  a  person's
       'story' is checked through networks. As a general comment  he  would
       say sometimes, yes.

   95. Dr George's view was that it is easier to move and settle in Tripoli
       and Benghazi than in a village. It  is  also  true  that  not  every
       Libyan has a tribal affiliation and a person may downplay it even if
       he does. There is a spectrum whereby at one extreme a person depends
       on networks or contacts and at the other a person who is more  self-
       sufficient. The general picture is that people rely on networks  and
       contacts. To live away from family is unusual.

   96. In relation to checkpoints, Dr Porter wrote that there is  an  acute
       desire to know who is travelling, from and to where,  and  why,  and
       that there is a lingering anxiety over a possible counter-revolution
       and a desire to protect informal economic activities from government
       oversight or encroachment by other groups. Checkpoints are also used
       to find individuals the operators have a regional, ethnic, tribal or
       family grievance with. This is consistent with Dr George's  evidence
       in relation to the use of  contacts,  interest  in  individuals  and
       their backgrounds.

   97. In terms of tribal affiliation, in a written report Dr Porter stated
       that there are many who  are  not  associated  with  tribes  or  who
       downplay  their  tribal  affiliation,  especially  in  Tripoli   and
       Benghazi where it has become less important than neighbourhood  ties
       or social class. It is entirely possible for someone to relocate  to
       another part of Libya without negative impact in relation to  tribal
       issues.

   98. Professor Joff�'s  written  evidence  was  that  Libyan  society  is
       peculiarly intimate as the population is essentially compressed into
       a very small space of less that 5 per cent of the total  land  area.
       Personal security cannot be achieved through physical  distance.  He
       referred to the family book  as  being  vital  in  order  to  ensure
       residence and registration through the municipality and the  police,
       as well as being an identity card.

   99. Drawing the threads of the background and expert evidence  together,
       we conclude that it is possible, in practical terms for  a  male  to
       relocate to another area of Libya, for example Tripoli or  Benghazi,
       particularly if he has  tribal  or  family  connections  there.  The
       absence of such  connections  would  not  prevent  the  person  from
       establishing himself, in the sense of being able to live in the  new
       community and find accommodation. The evidence does not reveal  that
       this would cause undue hardship.

  100. There may be cases, however, where an individual would not  be  able
       to avoid a risk of harm in a new area, particularly where the person
       has no connection to that area in terms of tribal or  family  links,
       but the person or group that is feared does  have  such  links.  The
       desire to know the details of a person's background and from  whence
       they came means that his presence there is reasonably likely  to  be
       discovered by the person or group who he is in fear of.

  101.  Needless  to  say,  a  fact-specific  enquiry  is   essential.   An
       appellant's assertion that the individual or group  that  is  feared
       has links to say, Tripoli or Benghazi, or another prospective  place
       of relocation, will need to be assessed in the light of the findings
       in relation to his overall credibility.

  102. In relation to a woman who has established a risk in her home  area,
       the possibility of internal relocation has a harder edge,  at  least
       in one respect. We take into account the evidence in  terms  of  the
       position of women in society in Libya, the difficulty  of  accessing
       accommodation if alone, and the rarity of  a  woman  arriving  in  a
       community without knowing any person there. In  the  light  of  that
       evidence, we  conclude  that  unless  in  the  prospective  area  of
       relocation the person has a close family or other connection,  aside
       from merely a  tribal  connection,  there  would  not  be  a  viable
       internal relocation option.

  103. This is for two reasons. First, it would be unduly harsh  to  expect
       such relocation given the position of women in society in Libya  and
       the difficulty that a lone woman would have in establishing  herself
       in a completely new community. Second, such a  woman  is  reasonably
       likely to be more noticeable with the result that her  presence  may
       more easily be discovered by the prospective persecutor.

   INDISCRIMINATE VIOLENCE-ARTICLE 15(C)

  104. Article 15(c) of Council Directive  2004/83/EC  ("the  Qualification
       Directive") defines serious harm within the Directive as:
             "serious and individual threat to a civilian's life  or  person
             by  reason  of  indiscriminate  violence   in   situations   of
             international or internal armed conflict."

  105. There was no dispute amongst the parties in  terms  of  how  Article
       15(c) is to be interpreted. We were  referred  to  the  decision  in
       Elgafaji v Staatssecretaris van Justitie [2009] ECR 1-921  in  which
       context we bear in mind what is said at [39] namely that:

             "the more the applicant is able to show that he is specifically
             affected by  reason  of  factors  particular  to  his  personal
             circumstances, the lower the level of  indiscriminate  violence
             required for him to be eligible for subsidiary protection."
  106. We were also referred to QD (Iraq) [2009] EWCA Civ 620 in which  the
       Court of Appeal at [40] summarised the issue in relation to  Article
       15(c) as  requiring  determination  of  whether  there  is  in  [the
       country]  or  a  material  part  of  it  such  a   high   level   of
       indiscriminate violence that substantial grounds exist for believing
       that the applicant would, solely by being present there, face a real
       risk which threatens his life or person.

  107. Subsequent to the hearing, the Court  of  Justice  of  the  European
       Union ("CJEU") gave judgment in Diakit� (Case C-285/12) in which  it
       was held that:


             "on  a  proper  construction  of  Article  15(c)  of  Directive
             2004/83,  it  must  be  acknowledged  that  an  internal  armed
             conflict exists, for the purposes of applying  that  provision,
             if a State's armed forces confront one or more armed groups  or
             if two or more armed groups confront  each  other.  It  is  not
             necessary  for  that  conflict  to  be  categorised  as  'armed
             conflict not of an international character' under international
             humanitarian law; nor is it necessary to carry out, in addition
             to an appraisal  of  the  level  of  violence  present  in  the
             territory concerned, a separate assessment of the intensity  of
             the armed confrontations, the  level  of  organisation  of  the
             armed forces involved or the duration of the conflict."

  108. We have not had the benefit  of  submissions  from  the  parties  in
       relation to the decision of the CJEU,  but  consider  that  for  the
       purposes  of  this  appeal  we  do  not  consider  such  submissions
       necessary in order for us to resolve the issues before us.

  109. In the appellants'  skeleton  arguments,  to  a  greater  or  lesser
       extent, an Article 15(c)/Article 3 risk is  asserted  generally,  in
       terms of the situation in Libya. In final submissions  the  position
       of the appellants' representatives was as follows.   Mr  Ficklin  on
       behalf of AT said that he had no instructions to and did not concede
       the Article 15(c) point but said that he would not make  submissions
       on it. Ms Patel on behalf of AMH stated that it was a matter for the
       Tribunal and she did not intend to make any (further) submissions in
       relation to Article 15(c). Ms Harrison for the remaining  appellants
       adopted the same position.

  110. The first question we must address is whether, in the whole of or in
       parts of Libya there is a general Article 15(c) risk,  that  is,  is
       there a serious and individual threat to a civilian's life or person
       by reason of indiscriminate violence because of a situation of armed
       conflict. As regards whether or not  there  exists  a  situation  of
       armed  conflict,  it  is  clear  from  Diakit�  that  to  meet  that
       requirement there is a low threshold.  We  consider  that  in  broad
       terms significant parts of the country could be  said  to  be  in  a
       state of armed conflict.

  111. In terms of "indiscriminate violence", in our consideration of  risk
       for particular categories of people  we  have  referred  to  various
       aspects of the background and expert evidence some of which  relates
       to the general situation.

  112. As to country  background  evidence  in  relation  to  incidents  of
       violence in Libya and the extent to which civilians are caught up in
       it, a flavour of it is provided by the following reports. The report
       by Amnesty International ("AI") of July 2012 refers to the  reckless
       use by militias of machine guns, mortars and  other  weapons  during
       tribal and territorial conflicts "killing and maiming bystanders".

  113. A Reuters report dated 8 November 2013 refers to fighting  by  rival
       militias in Tripoli describing it as a four hour battle  with  anti-
       aircraft guns and grenades, and as "the worst fighting for months in
       the Libyan capital". At least one person was killed and 12  wounded.
       It is said to have been  the  second  outbreak  of  street  fighting
       within days. Again, the Human Rights Watch report dated 17  November
       2013 states that militias from Misrata fired assault rifles, machine
       guns and heavy weapons  at  overwhelmingly  peaceful  protestors  in
       Tripoli on 15 November, with ensuing clashes  between  armed  groups
       and militias leaving 43 people dead and at least 460 wounded.  State
       security forces present at the initial  protest  are  said  to  have
       failed to protect protestors or to arrest and disarm  the  militias.
       The report goes on to state  that  the  43  people  killed  included
       people who were apparently  not  involved  in  the  protest  or  the
       clashes. Two of the victims appear to have  been  medical  personnel
       who were trying to retrieve wounded people.

  114.  In what is described as a related incident, Human Rights Watch  was
       told that armed men from Misrata entered  Tripoli's  al-Fallah  camp
       for displaced residents of Tawurga on 16  November  2013  and  fired
       indiscriminately at residents, leaving at least  one  man  dead  and
       three injured.

  115. In his written evidence, commenting on the position of AT, Dr George
       stated that the risk to him by reason of outbreaks of violence would
       not be high. He said in oral evidence that he  did  not  think  that
       everyone in Libya was at risk of being  killed  just  by  reason  of
       being in the country. When he visited he saw that women and children
       were out shopping. He referred to the fact that he was able to drive
       to Misrata, to tour the country, have coffee and speak to people  in
       parts of Tripoli and the Nafusa Mountains without  feeling  fear  or
       experiencing violence.

  116. Although he said that he  would,  in  effect,  be  more  careful  in
       Benghazi, but even there where levels of violence  were  higher,  he
       did not regard there as being a risk of indiscriminate violence.

  117. Dr Porter described  in  his  most  recent  report  "A  taxonomy  of
       violence" whereby  he  broadly  categorised  the  types  of  violent
       incident experienced in Libya and which formed part  of  the  cross-
       examination of Dr George on behalf of the respondent. He  states  in
       the same report that since July 2012 there has been an  increase  in
       violent crime  and  reports  of  criminally  motivated  murders  and
       carjackings. Kidnapping, murder, rape and  other  violent  crime  is
       increasing in Tripoli and elsewhere. Security in Benghazi  is  worse
       that in Tripoli and he refers to politically  motivated  murders  of
       former Qadhafi  officials  from  the  intelligence  services  and  a
       dramatic increase in criminal violence.

  118. Dr Porter agreed that there is no indiscriminate violence  targeting
       individuals, for example in terms  of  bombs  in  market  places  or
       snipers. He said that there has not been the indiscriminate  use  of
       violence as a political tool. The opinion in Libya  is  that  it  is
       Jihadi groups that were responsible for the assassinations of former
       intelligence  officers  mentioned  at  para   63   of   his   report
       (assassinations  of  former  members  of  the  Qadhafi  intelligence
       services).

  119. His view as to the risk of indiscriminate violence on the streets of
       Libya for someone going back, was that the risk is  relatively  low.
       It could happen but the likelihood is about 5  per  cent,  certainly
       less than a one in ten chance.

  120. In further cross-examination he said that there is a lot of violence
       in Libyan society and there is no formal check on the violence. Some
       can be described as indiscriminate but not on a wholesale  terrorist
       scale. He was not saying that  five  per  cent,  or  one  in  twenty
       Libyans, are suffering the effects  of  violence,  which  he  agreed
       would be awfully high.  This is in the realm of speculation and  (an
       assessment) would benefit from a statistical review  which  he  does
       not have.

  121. Of the three experts, Professor Joff� was alone in stating  that  in
       his view there was  a  risk  of  being  affected  by  indiscriminate
       violence.  The bomb blast in the marketplace on  4  August  2012  in
       Tripoli was a consequence of a dispute in the market. He  said  that
       there is  no  question  of  it  being  directed  against  particular
       individuals. The three car bombs that  exploded  in  Tripoli  on  19
       August were not directed towards individuals  but  were  part  of  a
       general tendency (for that sort of action) during Ramadan. They were
       designed, he said, to cause public insecurity and anxiety  and  were
       quite indiscriminate. Although only two people were killed, his view
       was that they were designed to cause considerable loss  of  life  to
       people on the streets and around the locations of the bombs.

  122. In relation to indiscriminate violence he said that  that  issue  is
       one of predictability  which  he  described  as  a  measure  of  the
       indiscriminate violence. He cited the example of the events  a  week
       prior to the hearing  when  the  local  population  were  peacefully
       demonstrating and were fired on by militias. It cannot be known from
       one moment to another whether there is going to be an  incident,  he
       said.

  123. He said that violence in Libya tends to be extreme.  The  levels  of
       violence are far higher than they would be in a well-ordered society
       and are reported in an active local  press.  One  can  walk  in  the
       street and find oneself in the middle of  a  firefight  between  two
       different groups. That happens regularly and the population  objects
       very strongly.

  124. The assassinations in Benghazi are targeted which is not always  the
       case elsewhere. Nearly all the arrests were in the first six  months
       to a year  after  the  conflict.  There  is  no  effective  judicial
       procedure and a lot have been in detention ever since.  In  relation
       to demonstrators being met with gunfire  in  June  in  Benghazi  the
       previous weekend, those are two dramatic incidents  but  there  have
       been other demonstrations that have been dispersed and  people  shot
       at at checkpoints.

  125. Judging by the background and expert evidence it is  undeniably  the
       case that many civilians-men, women and children-have  been  injured
       or lost their lives in revolutionary and  post-revolutionary  Libya.
       However, we are not satisfied that the  evidence  demonstrates  that
       there  is  such  a  high  level  of  indiscriminate  violence   that
       substantial grounds exist for believing that  an  individual  would,
       solely by reason of being present there,  face  a  real  risk  which
       threatens his life or person. We do not consider that the background
       evidence demonstrates this to  be  the  case,  and  nor  is  such  a
       proposition supported by the evidence of Drs George and Porter.

  126. Further, we do not consider that a different outcome results from an
       assessment of risk in relation to Article 3 of the ECHR.

  127. Whilst we accept that there is some foundation for Professor Joff�'s
       assessment of the violence as being unpredictable, with  respect  to
       him we do not agree that predictability (or lack of it) is a measure
       of indiscriminate violence. Unpredictability may often be a  feature
       of indiscriminate violence, but that does not assist in terms of  an
       assessment of whether there is, in fact, indiscriminate violence  of
       the necessary character  which  requires  recognition  in  terms  of
       international  protection.  To  take  two  simple  illustrations  at
       opposite ends of the spectrum; it may be predictable that every  day
       for several hours opposing factions in an  internal  armed  conflict
       will bomb each other's positions  which  are  in  heavily  built  up
       civilian areas. That violence is predictable  but  would  appear  to
       have the character of indiscriminate violence necessary for  Article
       15(c). At the other extreme, there may be a  bomb  blast  every  few
       months in a market but the timing of it is unpredictable. We do  not
       consider that that type of violence in a situation of internal armed
       conflict would amount  to  indiscriminate  violence  within  Article
       15(c).

  128. As regards the Article 15(c) issue of specific  risk  based  on  the
       notion of a 'sliding scale', (see Elgafaji [39])  we  consider  that
       our conclusions in this regard can be subsumed within  what  we  say
       about specific risk categories in general, to be considered both  in
       terms of refugee eligibility, humanitarian protection and Article  3
       of the ECHR.

   SPECIFIC CATEGORIES

Former/suspected Qadhafi loyalists or supporters

  129. The statement of issues describes the enquiry in  relation  to  this
       category in  terms  of  "those  perceived  as  having  been  Gaddafi
       supporters". However, it seems to us that the way we have  described
       this potential category of risk is more amenable to  assessment,  is
       more inclusive and more accurately reflects the evidence before  us.
       It describes those who were or are Qadhafi loyalists or  supporters,
       and those suspected of being such.

  130. In submissions Mr Palmer did not resile from what  is  said  in  his
       skeleton argument to the effect that  perceived  Qadhafi  supporters
       and fighters may be at real risk of persecution  and  ill-treatment.
       Indeed in submissions he accepted that the evidence amply  supported
       that view and that events had not changed for  the  better  in  this
       respect since May 2013, the date of the OGN for Libya.  It is useful
       to repeat what is said in the OGN at 3.10.8:

             "Given the generalised attitude of resentment towards perceived
             Col. Gaddafi supporters and fighters, and the force with  which
             the Gaddafi regime previously sought to subdue the  opposition,
             it is likely that applicants in this category will be  able  to
             show a need for international protection. Perceived  supporters
             of Gaddafi  and  his  regime  are  at  risk  of  extra-judicial
             execution,  arbitrary  detention,  torture,  ill-treatment  and
             death  in  detention,  both  by  authorities  of  the   Interim
             Government or  its  armed  affiliates,  as  well  as  by  armed
             militias operating without government control."

       And at 3.10.19 that:
             "Consideration should be given to the particular  circumstances
             of the individual, including ethnicity, age, and the nature and
             degree of the perceived relationship to the  Gaddafi's  regime.
             Where it is accepted that an individual applicant  was  closely
             involved  with  Gaddafi  and  the  regime,  or  his  particular
             circumstances indicate a likely risk of attracting the  adverse
             interest of militia brigades allied to the Libyan  authorities,
             a grant of asylum will generally be appropriate, subject to any
             exclusion  considerations  under  Article  1F  of  the  Refugee
             Convention."

  131. All  three  experts  were  in  agreement,  either  expressly  or  by
       implication, that open loyalty  to  the  former  regime  of  Colonel
       Qadhafi is  reasonably  likely  to  result  in  detention  and  ill-
       treatment. It is clear from the evidence that such  treatment  would
       amount to persecution, serious harm and a breach of the individual's
       human rights under Article 3 of the ECHR.

  132. The evidence does not support a contention that  any  resurgence  of
       the  former  regime  is  likely.  As  Dr  Porter  put  it,  "Libya's
       revolution-cum-civil  war  is  over".  Nevertheless,  perceived   or
       suspected support for the former  regime  is  reasonably  likely  to
       attract the adverse attention to  which  we  have  referred  in  the
       preceding paragraph.

  133. Former high-ranking officials within the intelligence services  have
       been the subject of politically motivated murders,  with  Dr  Porter
       referring to more than three dozen such attacks in 2013 in Benghazi.
       The evidence, however, does not limit the incidence of such  attacks
       to Benghazi. Dr George  emphasised  that  attitudes  towards  former
       members of Colonel Qadhafi's security agencies do not vary from  one
       part of Libya to another. The OGN does  not  suggest  that  internal
       relocation to avoid risk is a  possibility  for  a  person  in  this
       category.

  134. We do not interpret the evidence as limiting the potential for  risk
       only  to  those  who  were  formerly  members  of  the  intelligence
       services. Others with a close association at a senior level with the
       former regime we consider equally to be at risk. It is not possible,
       nor indeed would it be appropriate, to suggest a list describing the
       type of work or  association  with  the  former  regime  that  would
       potentially be in this risk category. The example most  often  given
       in the background and expert evidence is of  high-ranking  officials
       within the intelligence  services,  but  other  former  high-ranking
       officials are also reasonably likely to be at risk.

  135. Self-evidently, the closer an individual was to the centre of  power
       within the Qadhafi regime, the more likely it is  that  that  person
       would be at risk. Similarly, the further away  from  the  centre  of
       power the converse is  true.  During  and  in  the  immediate  post-
       revolutionary  period,  those  associated  or  suspected  of   being
       associated with the Qadhafi  regime  as  fighters  were  subject  to
       arbitrary arrest and ill-treatment. According to  Dr  George,  there
       has been a shift in the pattern of detentions from 2011  onwards  in
       that when there were a lot of ex-Qadhafi fighters  at  large,  there
       were more people to arrest.  Once  all  the  obvious  suspects  were
       arrested the rate of arrests tapered off, with most individuals from
       the Qadhafi era having fled the country  or  having  been  detained,
       resulting in fewer arrests  on  grounds  of  sympathy  for  Qadhafi.
       Having said that, he also stated that there was still a  fervour  to
       hunt down Qadhafi loyalists.

  136. We refer to this evidence from Dr George in this context because  it
       indicates  that  in  the  revolutionary  and  the  immediate   post-
       revolutionary fever, the  degree  of  association  with  the  former
       regime which would attract adverse attention is likely to have  been
       less than would now be  the  case,  subject  to  our  assessment  in
       relation to specific groups.

  137. We do not consider that the evidence leads to  the  conclusion  that
       anyone who was associated with the former regime would be at risk of
       persecutory ill-treatment, serious harm or Article  3  ill-treatment
       on return. As Dr Porter states in his report dated 14 October  2013,
       seventy per cent of the Libyan labour force in the time  of  Qadhafi
       worked in the public sector so that the "gross majority" of  Libyans
       were  in  some  way  associated  with  the  regime,  and  that  such
       association was especially high in Tripoli. He went on to state that
       it is not unusual for individuals to have worked for, or to have had
       family members who have had some  relationship  with,  the  previous
       government. Professor Joff�'s oral evidence was that the  effect  of
       the Political Isolation Law would be that up to half the  population
       would be excluded from holding office in the new regime.

  138. All this serves to emphasise  that  an  individual,  fact-sensitive,
       assessment will be required in every case. That assessment will have
       to take into account the nature and extent of an individual's actual
       or suspected past association with the  Qadhafi  regime  and  taking
       into account that having worked for  or  been  associated  with  the
       former regime is by no means exceptional in Libya.  We  consider  it
       unlikely that simply having worked for or been associated  with  the
       regime in any capacity whatsoever will be  sufficient  to  create  a
       real risk of harm on return.

  139. In the assessment of risk as a former or suspected Qadhafi  loyalist
       or supporter it is, however, important to bear in mind the nature of
       the enquiry that an individual may experience on return. At [60]  in
       his report of 2 October 2013,  under  the  heading  "Allegation  and
       suspicion" Dr George states that a major factor in personal security
       is the tendency of the militiamen to make "snap judgements" about  a
       person's background  and/or  loyalties,  referring  to  the  "strong
       propensity" in Libya to confuse supposition with hard fact. We  have
       before us evidence of what could be described as the variability  of
       degrees of discipline within the militias, with  weakest  discipline
       most likely to be encountered at an ad hoc checkpoint manned by  the
       '18 year old with a Kalashnikov' to use Dr George's expression.

  140. We mention this in order to explain that  it  may  well  be  that  a
       person who was associated with the former regime  in  a  significant
       way may not be able to avoid risk by relying on a nuanced or  overly
       sophisticated explanation  of  his  previous  involvement  with  the
       former regime.

Family members of those associated with the former regime

  141. We have already referred  to  evidence  that  the  majority  of  the
       population have had some association with the former regime and that
       it is not unusual for individuals to have worked for or to have  had
       family members who have had  some  relationship  with  the  previous
       government. The risk to a family member will again require  a  fact-
       specific assessment.

  142. There was some evidence of the potential for risk to family  members
       of those associated with the former regime but we did  not  find  it
       altogether consistent. Dr George said  that  whether  an  individual
       would be suspected of association with the former  regime  or  is  a
       relative of such would depend on the circumstances. He  referred  to
       the nature of Libyan and Middle Eastern  society  in  terms  of  the
       situation for relatives, stating  that  he  was  unable  to  show  a
       particular case but on the  other  hand  had  not  looked  for  one.
       Nevertheless, he cited the example of his researcher who encountered
       the neighbours of a particular person who said  that  that  person's
       brothers were members of the security forces who had  raped  people,
       and that if the individual himself returned he would be killed.

  143. In his written evidence Dr  Porter  said  that  individuals  closely
       associated with the former regime and "individuals' family  members"
       have been kidnapped, detained and murdered  because  of  their  past
       connections but went on to state that that is not always  the  case,
       citing the 'seventy per cent' figure to which we have referred.   In
       his oral evidence, when being asked about the  targeting  of  former
       members of the intelligence services, he said that the only evidence
       he had seen is "collateral damage" and that family  members  do  not
       appear to have  been  intended  targets  although  the  daughter  of
       Abdullah Al-Senussi was kidnapped  in  August  2013  and  eventually
       released in September 2013 after some pressure was brought  to  bear
       by cutting off the water supply to Tripoli.  Later  in  evidence  he
       said that there would be an increased risk to a person who was known
       to be  a  family  member  of  a  person  who  worked  for  Qadhafi's
       intelligence services.

  144. The UNSMIL report dated October 2013 states that those who had  been
       arrested include the family members of those who were  suspected  of
       having fought on the side of or  of  having  supported  the  Qadhafi
       regime.

  145. It appears to us that there is limited  support  for  a  proposition
       that family members of those associated with the former  regime,  or
       those suspected of being such, are now, as a matter  of  course,  at
       risk on return. The background evidence to that  effect  is  limited
       and the expert evidence not entirely consistent. We had one  example
       only cited to us. If there was such a risk  to  family  members,  we
       consider that there would be more evidence of it  in  the  extensive
       background materials to which we were referred.

  146. We do not rule out the possibility that an individual will  be  able
       to demonstrate such a risk but that would have to be demonstrated by
       a  highly  specific   individual   assessment   of   that   person's
       circumstances. Mere assertion of risk by  association  as  a  family
       member would not be sufficient without fact-specific evidence of the
       risk to that particular family member. The clear  evidence  is  that
       risk arises because of actual or perceived support for the  previous
       regime. A family member may be able to establish risk on this basis,
       but the mere fact  of  being  a  family  member  would  not  in  our
       judgement be sufficient.

 'Black Libyans' and Tawurga

  147.  The  term  'Black  Libyans'  is  used  in  the  Country  of  Origin
       Information report ("COI") report, and in the AI report of June 2013
       entitled  "Scapegoats  of  Fear".  Elsewhere,  the  term   is   used
       interchangeably with "dark-skinned Libyans". All three experts  from
       time to time used the term Black  Libyans.  Dr  George  described  a
       Black Libyan as being of  black  African  appearance.  We  therefore
       understand the phrase Black Libyan as  meaning  a  Libyan  of  black
       African appearance. We would include  within  our  understanding  of
       that phrase,  a  person  who  for  example,  although  not  able  to
       establish Libyan nationality, is a person for whom  Libya  is  their
       country of former habitual residence.

  148. The backdrop to the assessment of risk  for  Black  Libyans  is  the
       abundance of evidence of racism in Libyan  society  in  relation  to
       those of black African appearance. Professor  Joff�  refers  in  his
       August 2011 report to the legacy of uncontrolled migration from sub-
       Saharan Africa as one of "bitter hatred of Black  Africans".  Whilst
       referring to  intense  racism  that  characterises  Libya's  coastal
       society, he goes on to state in the September 2013 report  that  the
       attitude to  Libya's  ethnically  black  population  is  generalised
       throughout the country.

  149. Similarly, there is  uncontentious  evidence  that  ethnic  minority
       groups continue to suffer from discrimination, as they did under the
       previous regime.

  150. There was no firm agreement amongst the experts as to the number  of
       Black Libyans in Libya. Professor  Joff�  thought  that  they  could
       amount to a third or a half of the population. Dr Porter was unaware
       of the percentage, regarding this as a difficult statistic to divine
       because an individual in Libya could have characteristics  that  are
       considered to be black outside Libya but not within Libya  and  vice
       versa. Dr George told us that they  were  no  figures  but  that  he
       thought they may  amount  to  5  or  10  per  cent  of  the  coastal
       population, revising that figure in stating that 10 per cent may  be
       on the high side. In Kufra the figure may be  30  per  cent  and  in
       Sabha in the south west it  may  be  30  per  cent,  although  again
       stating that the latter figure may be on the high side.

  151. The evidence before us does not show that it  is  possible  to  tell
       from appearance alone that a person is from Tawurga, at least not in
       the opinion of the three experts. We express it in that way  because
       were not addressed on whether a Libyan would be able to  identify  a
       Tawurgan by appearance only. Dr George said that a Tawurgan would be
       identified from their ID documents or the person may say  that  they
       are Tawurgan (albeit that they might not be believed  if  they  said
       that they were not). Dr Porter said that it was not possible to  say
       without talking to someone whether they are a Black Libyan  or,  for
       example, an illegal immigrant  from  sub-Saharan  Africa.  Professor
       Joff� agreed that physical characteristics alone would not  allow  a
       distinction to be made between a  Black  Libyan  and  a  sub-Saharan
       African.

  152. Within the group that can be described  as  Black  Libyans  or  dark
       skinned Libyans, i.e. Libyans of African  appearance,  the  evidence
       does show that a distinction in risk terms can be  made  as  to  the
       position of certain ethnic groups. Such a distinction  has,  as  its
       foundation, twin pillars of racism towards those  of  black  African
       appearance, and assumptions or perceptions of loyalties. That is not
       to say that we conclude that those  pillars  are  pre-conditions  of
       risk,  only  that  they  are  features  of  the  evidence  that  are
       recognisable in our assessment of risk.

  153. The USSDR speaks of particular targets  of  arbitrary  and  unlawful
       killings as including possible  sub-Saharan  mercenaries  and  dark-
       skinned Libyans. The report refers to the detention  of  sub-Saharan
       African refugees and migrants having increased  significantly  after
       the fall of the Qadhafi government, on suspicion that they supported
       the former regime or were complicit in abuses during  the  conflict.
       The OGN, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and other reports
       contain  similar  assessments.  Background  reports  refer  to   the
       widespread  perception  that  Qadhafi  used  black  African  foreign
       mercenaries.

  154. It is as well at this point to refer to the evidence of  the  extent
       of the use by the Qadhafi regime of  foreign  mercenaries  of  black
       ethnicity, in so far as it is possible  to  determine  it.  The  OGN
       refers to allegations that mercenaries  were  recruited  from  Chad,
       Nigeria and Sudan as appearing to have been heavily exaggerated.  By
       contrast, Dr George in his written evidence  stated  that  Qadhafi's
       forces largely  comprised  foreign  mercenaries,  although  in  oral
       evidence  modified  that  view  to  state  that   Qadhafi's   forces
       "included" foreign mercenaries.

  155. Dr Porter also referred to the perception that Black Libyans  fought
       for Qadhafi and his view was that there was still  the  belief  that
       sub-Saharan Africans in Libya may be the remains of mercenaries  who
       fought for Qadhafi.

  156. We remind ourselves  that  the  OGN  at  3.3.15  refers  to  reports
       indicating that "those perceived to have been pro-Gaddafi loyalists,
       and those perceived to have been working or fighting on his  behalf,
       particularly those of African ethnicity are at  particular  risk  of
       ill treatment."

  157. That passage of the OGN does not,  however,  state  that  people  of
       African ethnicity are at particular risk of ill-treatment, only that
       those of African ethnicity perceived to have been pro-Qadhafi are at
       particularly at risk.

  158. The situation of Tawurgans we consider illustrates  the  distinction
       revealed by  the  evidence  between  Black  Libyans/those  of  black
       African appearance, and those from  a  particular  ethnic  group  or
       tribe.  There  is  considerable  evidence  that  the  Tawurgans  are
       perceived to have supported the Qadhafi regime during the  conflict,
       and Professor Joff� states that some did. He also refers to  reports
       of organised rapes by Tawurgans in Misrata, with the Misrata militia
       taking revenge and forcing all Tawurgans out of Tawurga.  Background
       evidence is to the same effect. Dr Porter cites Tawurga  as  a  good
       example of an area perceived as a whole to  have  been  allied  with
       Qadhafi. The  population  remains  displaced  and  excluded  by  the
       militias from returning. The OGN refers to  Human  Rights  Watch  as
       suggesting that crimes committed against the Tawurga may  amount  to
       crimes against humanity.

  159. Dr George told us that there are two categories of  people  who,  if
       stopped by militia, are likely to  attract  more  adverse  attention
       than others: Tawurgans and Mashashiya.

  160. Of significance is the AI report of 16 February  2012  which  states
       that people from sub-Saharan Africa who were detained during and  in
       the weeks after the conflict because of the belief  that  they  were
       Qadhafi mercenaries are now being held because  of  their  suspected
       illegal status "or related issues".  The  AI  report  of  June  2013
       ("Scapegoats of  Fear"),  whilst  stating  that  foreign  nationals,
       mainly from sub-Saharan Africa are at constant risk of exploitation,
       arrest and indefinite detention  pending  deportation,  nevertheless
       states that  Libya  remains  heavily  reliant  on  foreign  workers,
       especially  in   the   agricultural,   construction   and   services
       industries,  albeit  that  abuses  continue.  Notwithstanding   that
       assessment the report goes on  to  state  that  Libya  is  a  magnet
       destination for people, particularly sub-Saharan Africans and  North
       African  and  Middle  Eastern   nationals   looking   for   economic
       opportunities  or  for  international  protection   as   they   flee
       persecution, violence and armed conflicts in the region and  beyond.
       Many thousands are said  to  arrive  every  year  despite  cases  of
       detention on an almost daily basis.

  161.  The  reports  to  which  we  have  just  referred  concern  foreign
       immigrants, in particular those from  sub-Saharan  Africa.  A  Black
       Libyan, self-evidently, is from Libya. Whilst  we  accept  that  the
       evidence discloses an arbitrary 'system' of enquiry at  checkpoints,
       it is reasonably likely that a person of  black  African  appearance
       who is from Libya, would be able to  demonstrate  their  origins  as
       being from Libya, either from ID documents or by explanation of  the
       person's background.

  162. Dr George visited Libya most recently in September 2012. He told  us
       that it was common to see black people on the streets  of  Benghazi,
       Misrata and Tripoli going about their business in an  ordinary  way.
       Dr Porter visited Libya even more recently, in August 2013. He  said
       that in Tripoli, Misrata and Zawiye Black Libyans are moving  about,
       with many being involved in unskilled work such as labouring.

  163. Dr George accepted that it is not now  correct  to  say  that  Black
       Libyans would be perceived as mercenaries, which he said would be an
       overstatement. His evidence was also that it is an overstatement  to
       say that there is a risk of being  detained  and  suffering  serious
       harm simply on the basis of ethnicity, yet going on to state that it
       was a question of degree  and  that  there  was  still  a  risk.  He
       referred to the risk as not a serious, severe or  real  risk  but  a
       "potential risk" in the context of being confronted by the  18  year
       old with a Kalashnikov.

  164. Dr Porter said that he was not able to say  whether  Black  Africans
       are being  detained  on  the  basis  of  suspicion  of  having  been
       mercenary fighters. Similarly, he said that he was not able  to  say
       whether there is only discrimination against Black Libyans and  sub-
       Saharan Africans or whether their treatment extends to  persecution.



  165. Professor Joff� was last in Libya ten years ago  although  has  kept
       abreast of developments there. Referring to AMH he said  that  as  a
       Black Libyan he  would  face  not  only  profound  racism  but  also
       considerable discrimination "and persecution" simply because of  his
       ethnic origins. Later in his evidence he  said  that  Black  Libyans
       such as AMH do not exactly suffer the same fate as the Tawurgans but
       because Black Libyans are thought to have  been  supportive  of  the
       Qadhafi regime so they would suffer as the Tawurgans  do.  He  again
       referred to discrimination. His view  was  that  the  experience  of
       Tawurgans can be generalised to include all Black  Libyans,  stating
       that they are "symbolic" of Black Libyans.

  166. When it was put to him that the large scale arrests of Black Libyans
       and sub-Saharan Africans ceased in 2012,  he  said  that  they  have
       either all been arrested or have been displaced.

  167. We are not satisfied that the evidence does reveal a  real  risk  of
       persecution or Article 3 ill-treatment in the case of Black Libyans.
       Professor Joff�'s assessment of that risk we  think  extends  beyond
       the boundaries of what the other evidence discloses.  Black  Libyans
       are in fact seen out and about, apparently going about  their  daily
       business, witnessed by Dr George and Dr Porter. There is evidence of
       increasing  migration  to  Libya  of   sub-Saharan   Africans.   The
       background evidence to which we have  been  referred  does  not  now
       reveal  the  large  scale   detentions   and   mass   arrests   that
       characterised the revolution or  its  immediate  aftermath.   Whilst
       there are arrests/detentions of those of black  African  appearance,
       this is  for  the  most  part  shown  to  be  in  terms  of  illegal
       immigration of sub-Saharan Africans.

  168. The effect of Professor Joff�'s assessment in relation to  the  risk
       of detention at a checkpoint at least, was that up to a third of the
       population would be at risk of detention in those circumstances.  We
       are not satisfied that the other evidence reveals  this  to  be  the
       case. The situation 'on the ground' is  clearly  illustrated  by  Dr
       Porter's evidence of his relatively recent  visit  to  Libya  during
       which he said he saw many other Libyans driving, that there is a lot
       of traffic on the roads going through the checkpoints  and  that  in
       fact traffic is a problem on Libyan roads.

  169. There is no guarantee of  safety  but  the  UK's  obligations  under
       international refugee or human rights  law  do  not  demand  such  a
       guarantee. We acknowledge Dr George's  expression  of  a  "potential
       risk". Otherwise expressed this translates as a  chance  of  adverse
       interest for a Black Libyan in Libya and as such does not engage the
       UK's international obligations.

  170. However, we are satisfied that presently there is  a  real  risk  of
       persecution or Article 3 ill-treatment for a Tawurgan  returning  to
       Libya. The twin pillars  underpinning  that  risk  are  the  endemic
       racism in Libyan society, the evidence of which we have referred to,
       and assumptions or perceptions of loyalties.

  171. Mr Palmer submitted that it would be going too far to say  that  all
       Tawurgans would be at risk on return, suggesting that there  may  be
       cases where a Tawurgan has very good links in  Tripoli.  Others,  he
       suggested, who have further afield to travel, may encounter  Misrata
       militia at a checkpoint and it cannot be excluded that such a person
       may be detained. Nevertheless, it was conceded, and we think rightly
       conceded,  that  almost  all  Tawurgans  would   be   in   need   of
       international protection. Mr Palmer suggested that one could not  go
       so far as to say that all Tawurgans  are  at  risk  but  it  may  be
       difficult to find individual cases where such a person may not be at
       risk.

  172. We consider that it would be a rare case in which it could  be  said
       that a Tawurgan would not be at risk of persecution or Article 3 ill-
       treatment on return. There is always the  possibility  that  in  any
       individual case there will be exceptions to the generality, but  the
       mere fact of having very good links to  Tripoli  would  not  in  our
       judgement be a basis for concluding that a person of Tawurgan ethnic
       background could safely return  to  Libya,  whether  to  Tripoli  or
       elsewhere. Aside from the case of a Tawurgan with very good links to
       Tripoli, a scenario we have excluded as a basis for the avoidance of
       risk, Mr Palmer did not suggest any other examples of  a  person  of
       Tawurgan ethnic background who could avoid the risk of harm, and  we
       cannot conceive of  any.  Whilst  not  obviating  the  need  for  an
       individual assessment, we are satisfied that a  person  of  Tawurgan
       ethnicity is at real risk  of  persecution  and/or  Article  3  ill-
       treatment on return  to  Libya,  whether  in  Tripoli,  Benghazi  or
       elsewhere.

  173. The risks we have referred to in passing through checkpoints do  not
       make internal relocation viable in the case of such  an  individual,
       who would in the great majority of cases presumably be from  Tawurga
       to which re-entry is in any event prevented by  militias.  Effective
       protection is not available to Tawurgans, self-evidently because the
       risk arises from the manifestations of the State in the form of  the
       various militias, which operate (largely) on behalf of the State.



Tuareg

  174. There was less evidence before us in relation to the Tuareg, who are
       another group of black African appearance. We did not hear  evidence
       in relation to whether it  is  possible  to  identify  a  Tuareg  by
       appearance alone and only Professor Joff� referred to that group  in
       his evidence. Nevertheless,  we  consider  that  there  are  obvious
       parallels between the Tuareg and the Tawurga  and  sufficient  other
       evidence such as to allow us to make an informed judgement about the
       potential for risk on return for those of Tuareg ethnicity.

  175. The OGN refers to the  Tuareg  as  one  of  the  principal  minority
       groups. Professor Joff� referred in evidence to the  anger  directed
       towards the mercenary  forces  who  were  considered  to  be  black,
       including the Tuareg. The OGN  refers  to  reports  of  dark-skinned
       Libyans, including  Tuaregs,  being  removed  from  their  homes  in
       Tripoli and being held in detention centres and prisons, the  source
       for this information being the USSDR for  2012  published  in  April
       2013. We remind ourselves that the  OGN  states  that  "though  some
       Libyan Tuareg have opposed Gaddafi, many others found employment  in
       the Libyan regular army, together  with  volunteers  from  Mali  and
       Niger. As a result, many Libyans tend  to  identify  all  Tuareg  as
       regime supporters." It continues that  as  of  January  2013,  2,400
       Tuareg who had fled Ghadames remained internally displaced in Libya.

  176. The parallels with the Tawurga are immediately obvious. Both are  of
       black African appearance;  both  were  and  are  perceived  to  have
       supported  the  previous  regime  and  both  groups  are  internally
       displaced.

  177. As in relation to those of Tawurgan ethnicity, we are satisfied that
       there is a real risk of persecutory ill-treatment and Article 3 harm
       for a person of Tuareg ethnicity on return to Libya. Again, we  find
       that there would be no sufficiency of protection  and  there  is  no
       viable option of internal relocation.

Mashashiya

  178. Dr George told us that the Mashashiya are not Black Libyans. He did,
       however, say that, along with the Tawurga, the  Mashashiya  are  the
       subject  of  adverse  attention,  albeit  for   different   reasons.
       Professor Joff�'s written evidence in his  latest  reports  confirms
       the continued  'victimisation'  of  the  Mashashiya  by  the  Zintan
       militia.

  179. The AI report, albeit dated February 2012, refers  to  thousands  of
       people having been evicted or having fled their homes in the  Nafusa
       Mountains, mainly the Mashashiya and Qawalish tribes, as well as  in
       Sirte and Bani Walid, and remain targeted by militias  (particularly
       the militias from Zintan) because of their alleged support  for  the
       Qadhafi forces during the conflict. The OGN includes the  Mashashiya
       as a group at risk in its current assessment, albeit with  reference
       to the same AI report, and referring to them as a community that had
       largely backed Qadhafi in the conflict.

  180. The position of the Mashashiya provides an example of a  group  that
       the background and expert evidence reveals to be at  risk  in  Libya
       but not, as far as the evidence put before us is  concerned,  having
       racism as its background, unlike in relation to other groups we have
       referred to. This illustrates that the architecture of risk  is  not
       dependent only on the twin  pillars  of  racism  and  perception  of
       loyalty to the former regime, as we have sought to make clear.

Qawalish

  181. None of the experts identified this group as one that would  be  the
       subject of adverse attention in Libya, none of the reports referring
       to the Qawalish. Having said that, none of  the  experts  was  asked
       about this specific group. We have not been told whether this  is  a
       group of black African appearance, although we suspect not from  the
       context of the background evidence put before us.

  182. There is background evidence indicating that this too  is  a  group,
       along with the  Tawurga,  Tuareg  and  Mashashiya,  that  have  been
       targeted in the past on the basis of actual or perceived support for
       the Qadhafi regime and they  too  have  been  displaced  (USSDR;  AI
       report 16 February 2012). The USSDR includes  the  Qawalish  in  the
       group of IDP's from tribes and cities known to have  been  loyal  to
       the Qadhafi government. AI reports that this group are  particularly
       targeted by the Zintan militia.

  183. We do not, however,  consider  that  there  is  sufficient  evidence
       before us in relation to the current  risk  for  the  Qawalish.  The
       USSDR relates to 2012 as does the AI report. We have not been  given
       examples of instances where members  of  this  group  have  recently
       faced problems of harassment, detention and ill-treatment, or indeed
       what the current attitude  to  them  is.  We  have  no  evidence  in
       relation to whether they have been allowed to return to their homes.



  184. We do not exclude the possibility that those in this group may be at
       risk of persecution or Article  3  ill-treatment  but  the  evidence
       before us is not sufficient to establish a reasonable likelihood  of
       such treatment. In a case where a member of  this  group  alleges  a
       risk of persecution or Article 3 harm on return to Libya, it will be
       necessary for specific evidence of current risk to be adduced.

Tibu[6]

  185. There is background  evidence  in  relation  to  the  Tibu,  another
       minority group of black African appearance.  There  is  evidence  of
       discrimination against this group, both  pre  and  post  revolution.
       However, according to the COI, quoting a report from  Al-Jazeera  of
       December 2012, they now dominate Libya's southern  desert,  guarding
       remote checkpoints, oil fields and weapons stockpiles.  The  OGN  at
       3.12.19 states that Qadhafi never liked the Tibu and at  3.12.20  it
       states that:

             "The indigenous, semi-nomadic  Tabu,  marginalised  by  Gaddafi
             under his Arabisation  campaign,  staked  out  a  leading  role
             during the 2011 revolution with a goal to  secure  their  civil
             rights. Combining their intimate knowledge of the Sahara with a
             tribal network spanning both sides of the borders, they  forged
             a successful blockade against pro-regime  reinforcements.  When
             the revolution was  won,  a  grateful  transitional  government
             controversially awarded the Tabu  commander  Issa  Abdel  Majid
             Mansour oversight over vital desert crossings to the  detriment
             of Kufra's majority Arab  Zwai  tribe.  The  Zwai,  whose  ties
             stretch over oil-rich territory to  Ajdabiya,  150km  south  of
             Benghazi, previously benefited from  Gaddafi's  divide-and-rule
             tactics".

  186. Whilst Professor Joff� would include the Tibu as being amongst those
       who would be in a risk category, his view is on the basis  that  the
       Tibu are black African. However, the background  evidence  does  not
       support the suggestion that this group would be at risk,  either  in
       their own right, or, for the reasons we have  given,  on  the  basis
       that they are part of a group  that  has  been  described  as  Black
       Libyans.

Women

  187. Background evidence indicates that despite constitutional guarantees
       in relation to equal rights, these were not enforced by the  interim
       governments, particularly  in  relation  to  women  and  minorities.
       Militias  and  extremists  are  said  to  have  used  violence   and
       intimidation against women they considered in violation of religious
       law and cultural norms.  The COI and OGN both describe the  problems
       faced by women in terms of  domestic  violence  and  discrimination.
       During the revolution thousands of women were raped.

  188. In rural areas societal discrimination restricted women's movements,
       according to the OGN, even to local destinations.  Most  women  will
       not travel unless accompanied by a husband or male relative. Members
       of the elite, however, have more freedom in  this  regard.  We  also
       note what is said about unmarried or divorced women living on  their
       own.

  189. There were some  news  reports  of  the  government's  intention  to
       address the issue of violence against women. A BBC news report of 13
       December 2011 refers to women heading  two  ministries;  health  and
       social affairs. It nevertheless goes on to describe  Libyan  society
       as a  deeply  conservative,  male  dominated  society  where  public
       gatherings are often segregated. There is stated in that  report  to
       be an assertive new generation of women's rights emerging.

  190. Dr Porter thought that it is possible for a woman to travel overland
       from Tripoli to Benghazi, but  would  need  to  be  accompanied.  In
       written evidence he said that it was not necessarily dangerous for a
       woman to travel alone but it would be unusual. She would be  subject
       to additional  questioning  at  checkpoints.  Since  the  revolution
       Libyan society has  become  more  socially  conservative.   In  oral
       evidence he said that a  woman's  ability  to  navigate  checkpoints
       would depend on the purpose of the travel and he was not aware of  a
       woman having suffered ill-treatment at a checkpoint.  He said that a
       single woman with no links to the community would  have  "tremendous
       difficulty" accessing accommodation and that it was very rare for  a
       woman to arrive in a community without knowing a  single  person  in
       the community, or to rent a room by herself because of the suspicion
       that would arise of her  being  a  prostitute.  There  would  be  no
       difficulties specific to women in flying from Tripoli  to  Benghazi.
       If a woman were travelling with her brother, that would overcome the
       difficulties she might face in overland travel if alone.

  191. The expert evidence was consistent with the background  evidence  in
       terms of the difficulty  of  accessing  accommodation  as  a  single
       woman.

  192. The OGN at 3.11.15 refers to the  inability  of  the  government  to
       provide women protection against harm. Some women and particular sub-
       categories of women  will  be  able  to  demonstrate  the  need  for
       international  protection  but  taking  into  account  all  relevant
       factors. It is as well to set out in full what the  OGN  says  about
       the potential for risk to women in Libya.

  193. At 3.11.15 it states the following:

             "Given the generalised discrimination towards women  in  Libya,
             and  the  inability  of  the  current  Government  to   provide
             protection against harm, it  is  likely  that  some  women  and
             especially particular sub-categories of women  (e.g.  women  of
             African  ethnicity,  victims  of  sexual  violence,  and  women
             perceived to have been allied to the Gaddafi  regime)  will  be
             able to demonstrate a need for  international  protection.  All
             relevant factors should be taken into  account,  including  the
             age,  health,  educational  and  economic   status,   and   the
             individual circumstances of the  applicant.  Female  applicants
             able to show they are at real risk of persecution because  they
             are accused  of  sexual  'misdemeanours'  or  offences  against
             family honour are likely to be able to show that they fall into
             the category of a particular social group (PSG)."

       And at 3.11.16

             "Given the circumstances and cultural factors  set  out  above,
             female applicants who have been  raped  by  soldiers  loyal  to
             Gaddafi or other combatants are also likely to be able to  show
             that they are at real  risk  as  members  of  a  PSG.  Evidence
             suggests that even where the rape victim's  father  or  husband
             does not attach personal blame to her,  as  is  the  case  with
             other categories of sexual dishonour, she is still at  risk  of
             being the subject of an 'honour' killing, in order to save  her
             and her family from dishonour."

  194. The evidence does not reveal that purely on the basis of  their  sex
       women in general are at risk. What is said in the OGN about risk  in
       relation to the potential  for  risk  to  women,  in  at  least  one
       respect, says no more than what we consider  already  to  have  been
       established, that is that women perceived to have been allied to the
       Qadhafi regime will be able to establish the need for  international
       protection. That, however, is not because the person is female,  but
       because she comes within the risk category that we  have  identified
       of former/suspected Qadhafi loyalists or supporters.

  195. There is no inconsistency between what we have said in the preceding
       paragraph and our conclusions in relation to family members of those
       associated with the former regime. As we have said, merely  being  a
       (female) family member does not, of itself, create the risk.

  196. We have already emphasised the need for a  case-specific  and  fact-
       sensitive enquiry. Such  an  approach  is  trite  but  pertinent  in
       particular in  considering  the  case  of  a  female  returnee.  For
       example, the OGN at 2.3.8 states that women who are members  of  the
       elite have more freedom in terms of travel. That illustrates what is
       said at 3.11.15 about all relevant factors needing to be taken  into
       account. We do not understand the OGN to be stating  that  in  every
       case, a woman who, for example, is accused of a sexual  misdemeanour
       would be at risk.  Her  status,  her  connections,  her  ability  to
       travel, would all be relevant factors.

  197. To take another example; a woman of black African ethnicity may more
       easily be able to demonstrate risk on account of an accusation of  a
       sexual misdemeanour because in her case there is the added issue  of
       discrimination and racism against those of African  ethnicity  which
       is likely to affect her circumstances on return.

  198. The combinations  are  potentially  many  and  varied.  Devising  an
       endless list of hypothetical examples is more likely to hinder  than
       help in the assessment of risk but we have sought to illustrate  the
       need for all factors to be taken into account.

Failed asylum seekers

  199. No background evidence was put before us indicating a risk to failed
       asylum seekers from the UK. The AI report of  June  2013,  where  it
       refers to the  violation  of  human  rights  of  foreign  nationals,
       including asylum seekers, plainly refers to those seeking asylum  on
       Libyan soil.

  200. Dr George said that a failed asylum seeker would not be at  risk  on
       return from the UK given that very many Libyans have been living  in
       exile. He went on to say  that  the  phenomenon  of  Libyans  living
       outside  the  country  for  many  years  is  nothing  very  special.
       Similarly, as we  have  already  seen  above  under  the  subheading
       "Travel", Dr Porter said that there have been no reported  instances
       of returnees being detained by airport authorities  or  militias  on
       leaving the airport (at Tripoli) and there has been  no  persecution
       of those who "sat out" the revolution in Europe or the US.

  201. No submissions were made on behalf of any of the  appellants  before
       us to the effect that an appellant would be at risk on return purely
       on the basis that he/she would  be  returning  as  a  failed  asylum
       seeker.



Risk on arrival at Tripoli or Benghazi airport

  202. Tripoli airport is the international airport at which  flights  from
       the UK arrive. Whilst there have been occasional security  concerns,
       the evidence does not  warrant  a  finding  that  for  the  ordinary
       traveller, or a returnee from the UK (whether  as  a  failed  asylum
       seeker  or  otherwise)  any  protection  risk  arises.   Admittedly,
       security is maintained or enforced by militia or former militia  now
       under the, at least  nominal,  control  of  the  government  but  Dr
       Porter's evidence effectively testified to the relative normality of
       the situation at Tripoli airport.  Again,  none  of  the  appellants
       contended that a risk arises merely  from  the  fact  of  return  to
       Tripoli airport.

  203. In relation to Benghazi airport, the situation there we  see  as  to
       some extent reflecting the more  precarious  security  situation  in
       Benghazi itself. There was evidence from Professor Joff� as  to  the
       struggle for control of the airport and continuing tensions in  that
       regard. Nevertheless, neither the  background  nor  expert  evidence
       supports any suggestion that arrival at the airport per se, for  the
       ordinary traveller and including returnees from the UK,  involves  a
       risk that requires recognition in terms of international protection.
       In any event, as we have said, return from the UK will in the  first
       instance be to Tripoli airport.

Onward travel from Tripoli

  204. The potential for risk under this head is substantially  covered  by
       the observations and conclusions we have set out above. We have  set
       out the evidence in relation to checkpoints, manned by  militia.  Dr
       Porter told us that checkpoints exist on  all  major  roads  out  of
       Tripoli. We consider it inevitable that travel by road from  Tripoli
       will involve passing through  checkpoints.  Given  the  evidence  of
       checkpoints at or  around  Tripoli  airport,  an  encounter  with  a
       checkpoint after leaving the  airport  is  likely  to  occur  sooner
       rather than later.

  205. As we have seen, whether a person will be stopped  at  a  checkpoint
       depends on various factors. To take  an  obvious  example  from  the
       evidence, a woman travelling alone is more likely to be stopped than
       a man  alone.  Overland  travel  is  possible.  The  possibility  of
       harassment by a militia or being a victim of general banditry cannot
       be ruled out, but Dr Porter's evidence was that such a risk  is  not
       exceptionally high.

  206. Both Dr Porter and Dr George travelled  by  road  in  Libya  without
       coming to harm. Of course, being white European may,  on  one  view,
       have reduced the risk  to  them  and  we  would  not  wish  to  draw
       unwarranted conclusions from their experience.  However,  travel  to
       and from the airport is clearly a daily occurrence for  Libyans  and
       the roads in general are said to be busy.

  207. The evidence does not support a conclusion that travel from  Tripoli
       airport,  by  road,  poses  a  risk  that   requires   international
       protection for those who are not otherwise  at  risk.  The  evidence
       similarly establishes that it is possible to travel from Tripoli  to
       Benghazi by road, without  unacceptable  risk.  In  coming  to  this
       conclusion we have taken into account the  background  evidence  and
       the evidence of Professor Joff� in relation to the family  book.  We
       do not consider that a person who does not  possess  a  Family  Book
       would not be able to travel in safety by road.  As  Professor  Joff�
       accepted, it is likely that many people will have lost their  family
       book given the recent upheavals in the country, and this is  a  fact
       that we consider is likely to be understood by would be  inquisitors
       at a checkpoint.

  208. Our assessment of the issue of safety of internal travel is  subject
       to the following qualification. We have seen that travel to  certain
       parts of Libya is prohibited, with a closed  military  zone  in  the
       south of the country. The OGN  refers  to  a  threat  from  criminal
       activities in areas bordering Sudan, Chad, Niger  and  Algeria,  and
       with the exception of the official land border crossings to  Tunisia
       and Egypt, visitors and residents are not permitted to travel in the
       interior or to border areas without an officially  sanctioned  guide
       or specific permission from the authorities. We were not referred to
       any evidence in relation to the  ease  or  otherwise  with  which  a
       person would be able to obtain permission from  the  authorities  to
       travel to the "interior" of the country.

  209. In terms of risk in travelling to other areas, we bear in  mind  the
       UK government's travel advice, which  we  have  set  out  above.  It
       advises against all but essential travel to Tripoli, Zuwara, Zawiye,
       al Khums, Zlitan and Misrata, and to  the  coastal  towns  from  Ras
       Lanuf to the Egyptian border, with the  exception  of  Benghazi.  It
       then goes on to state that the FCO advises against all travel to all
       other parts of Libya, including Benghazi.

  210. However, precautionary travel advice in  relation  to  a  relatively
       newly post-revolutionary country which is, to use Dr George's  words
       "awash" with arms, is advice one would expect from  any  government.
       That does not mean that for all returning Libyans there  is  a  need
       for international  protection,  as  our  analysis  of  the  evidence
       reveals.

  211. We go no further than to repeat that land travel is possible and can
       be undertaken without giving rise to a risk of  harm  that  requires
       recognition in terms of international protection. That is even aside
       from the question of  internal  relocation  which  we  have  already
       considered. The specific areas of enquiry that are  the  subject  of
       these appeals relate to Tripoli, Benghazi and Zawiye.  Nevertheless,
       we are able to conclude on the evidence before us that  a  claim  to
       international protection is unlikely to succeed simply on the  basis
       of the risk of travel to any particular area of Libya,  again  quite
       apart from  the  question  of  internal  relocation.  Area  specific
       evidence would have to be adduced which  establishes  such  a  risk.
       Nevertheless, although we do not consider that any different outcome
       results from an assessment of risk in travel from Zawiye to Tripoli,
       we consider it separately because AMH is from Zawiye and it  is  one
       of the specific issues with which this decision is concerned.





Travel to Zawiye from Tripoli airport

  212. Professor Joff� told us that Zawiye is a provincial capital  in  its
       own right. AMH said in evidence that it was 40-45 km  from  Tripoli.
       We note the UK government's travel advice, which includes Zawiye. We
       have summarised an AI report of February 2012 which describes Zawiye
       as having experienced violent confrontations between  supporters  of
       the uprising and  Qadhafi  forces  and  where  revenge  attacks  and
       reprisals by local militia have taken place against  those  who  are
       known to have, or are suspected  of  having,  supported  the  former
       regime. In addition, a report from Al Jazeera dated 25  August  2013
       referred to clashes in Zawiye  between  members  of  the  Warshifana
       tribal group and residents of the town. Four people are said to have
       been killed and several wounded.

  213. Professor Joff� referred to the dislike of Black Libyans from Zawiye
       as being intense. He also said that Zawiye is controlled by  militia
       who have been extremely active in suppressing  pro-Qadhafi  activity
       in Bani Walid. With reference to AMH, he said that as a Black Libyan
       he would face profound racism, and particularly in  the  context  of
       Zawiye he  is  likely  to  suffer  considerable  discrimination  and
       persecution simply because of  his  ethnic  origins.  He  said  that
       whether there are checkpoints on the way to Zawiye varies  depending
       on  the  activities  of  the  local  militia  and  there  could   be
       checkpoints inside Zawiye itself.

  214. On the narrow question of whether it  is  possible  to  travel  from
       Tripoli to Zawiye, we repeat the observations we have made under the
       sub-heading "Onward travel from Tripoli". In addition, we note  that
       Dr Porter visited Zawiye when he went to Libya in  August  2013.  He
       did not experience difficulties specific  to  making  that  trip  by
       road, albeit that we note  that  his  personal  profile  is  plainly
       different from that of a returning Libyan. Nevertheless, we  do  not
       consider that the evidence establishes that travel  to  Zawiye  from
       Tripoli presents any  greater  challenge,  difficulty  or  risk,  in
       itself, over and above the particular risk that there may be for  an
       individual who otherwise had established a risk  of  persecution  or
       Article 3 ill-treatment. The mere fact of  travel  from  Tripoli  to
       Zawiye does not in itself create a risk to a person  who  would  not
       otherwise be at risk.



COUNTRY GUIDANCE

  215. Drawing on all the expert and background evidence, and  taking  into
       account the submissions of the parties, we  come  to  the  following
       conclusions:

       (1)    In the aftermath of the armed revolution that  brought  about
             the fall of the dictatorial and repressive  regime  of  Colonel
             Qadhafi, the central government in Libya has relied on  various
             militias to undertake security and  policing  functions.  Those
             militias and the many others that operate within  Libya,  often
             have their own interests, loyalties and priorities which may or
             may not coincide with the interests of the central  government.



     Article 15(c)

       (2)    There is not such a high level of indiscriminate violence  in
             Libya, within the meaning of Article 15(c) of Council Directive
             2004/83/EC ("the Qualification Directive") so as to  mean  that
             substantial grounds exist  for  believing  that  an  individual
             would, solely by being present there, face a  real  risk  which
             threatens his or her life or person.

     Former regime members and associates

       (3)    Having regard to the generally hostile attitude of society to
             the former regime, the following are, in general, at real  risk
             of persecution or Article 3 ill-treatment on return to Libya: -



         (a) former high ranking officials within the intelligence  services
             of that regime;

     (b) others with an association at senior level with that regime.

       (4)        As a general matter, the closer an individual was to  the
             centre of power within the former regime, the more likely  that
             the individual will be able to establish a risk of  persecution
             or Article 3 ill-treatment on return.

       (5)    The majority of the population of Libya  either  worked  for,
             had some association with, or has a member of  the  family  who
             worked for or had an association with the Qadhafi regime.  Such
             employment or association alone is not sufficient to  establish
             a risk of persecution or Article 3 ill-treatment on return.

       (6)    In general, family members of those described in (3) and  (4)
             above are not at risk of  persecution  or  a  breach  of  their
             protected rights on return. It is possible,  however,  that  an
             individual will be able to establish such a risk but this  will
             need to be demonstrated by specific evidence  relating  to  the
             individual's  circumstances.  Mere   assertion   of   risk   by
             association as a family member would not be sufficient  without
             fact-specific evidence of the risk to  that  particular  family
             member.

     Black Libyans etc

        (7)   A 'Black Libyan' is a Libyan of black African appearance, and
             includes  a  person  who  may  not  actually   possess   Libyan
             nationality but for whom  Libya  is  their  country  of  former
             habitual residence.  There  is  endemic  racism  within  Libyan
             society towards Black Libyans. However, Black Libyans  who  are
             not Tawurga or Tuareg are not per se at risk of persecution  or
             Article 3 ill-treatment on return, and will  only  be  able  to
             establish the need for international protection with  reference
             to some additional factor particular to that individual.

       (8)    The Tawurga are Black Libyans who are perceived by Libyans to
             have been mercenaries on the side of the Qadhafi regime and  to
             have committed human rights abuses during the  revolution.  The
             Tuareg are also Black Libyans and are also  perceived  to  have
             been supporters of the former regime.

       (9)    Whilst there remains a need for an individual  assessment  of
             each individual's circumstances, a person  who  is  Tawurga  or
             Tuareg will in general  be  able  to  establish  the  need  for
             international protection. The same is true of persons from  the
             Mashashiya ethnic or tribal group. The Mashashiya are not Black
             Libyans but are similarly perceived as a  group  to  have  been
             supporters of the Qadhafi regime.

     Women

        (10)  Whilst  Libya  is  a  male-dominated  society  and  there  is
             evidence of discrimination and violence against women and  poor
             recognition of women's rights, being female  does  not  per  se
             establish a risk on return. However, taking  into  account  all
             the circumstances, including a woman's age,  health,  level  of
             education and economic status, one or  more  of  the  following
             characteristics  or  factors  are  likely,  depending  on   the
             circumstances, to be significant in relation to the  assessment
             of risk on return for a woman:

          a)  African ethnicity;

         b)  Being a victim of sexual violence, including having been raped
                    by soldiers loyal to the  Qadhafi  regime  or  by  other
                    combatants;

                       c) Being a  woman  accused  or  suspected  of  sexual
                    misdemeanours or offences against family honour.

     Failed asylum seekers

       (11)       Failed asylum seekers are not, for that reason alone,  at
             real risk on return.

     Risk at point of return

       (12)   There is no real risk  of  harm  to  the  ordinary  traveller
             arriving either at Tripoli international  airport  or  Benghazi
             airport.

       (13)   However, a person who has established that they  come  within
             one of the risk categories set out at (3), (4),  (9)  and  (10)
             above, will be at risk from government security forces or  from
             militias, on  arrival  at  Tripoli  International  Airport,  on
             account  of  information  that  is  required  to  be  given  by
             passengers on arrival.




     Risk following return

       (14)   Even if a person described in (13)  above  is  able  to  pass
             through the airport without  being  detained,  because  of  the
             presence of militias at various checkpoints such  a  person  is
             reasonably likely to be detained at a checkpoint  en  route  to
             his or her home area.

       (15)   Notwithstanding  the  prevalence  of  checkpoints  manned  by
             militias, it  is  possible  to  travel  overland  from  Tripoli
             airport  to  other  destinations  without  a   real   risk   of
             persecution, serious harm  or  Article  3  ill-treatment.  Land
             travel in general is possible and  can  be  undertaken  without
             giving rise to a risk of  harm  that  requires  recognition  in
             terms of international protection. The evidence does not reveal
             such a level of arbitrary or irrational conduct on the part  of
             militias at checkpoints such as to put the  ordinary  traveller
             at real risk.  A claim to international protection is  unlikely
             to succeed simply on the basis of a claimed risk of  travel  to
             any particular area of Libya. Area specific evidence would have
             to be adduced which establishes such a risk.

       (16)   The 'family book' is the main proof of  citizenship,  listing
             family members and  being  required,  for  example,  to  obtain
             employment or a bank loan. However, the fact that a person does
             not possess a 'family book' would  not  prevent  travel  within
             Libya and the lack of a family book would not itself give  rise
             to a risk of harm.

     Sufficiency of protection

       (17)   In general, an individual who succeeds in establishing a real
             risk of harm by reference to the risk  categories  set  out  at
             (3),  (4),  (9)  and  (10)  above,  will  not  be  afforded   a
             sufficiency of protection from that harm.

     Internal relocation

       (18)   Likewise,  such  individuals  would  not,  in  general,  have
             available to them the option of internal relocation.

       (19)   For persons who have established a real  risk  of  proscribed
             ill-treatment in their home area for a  reason  other  than  by
             reference to one of the categories set out above,  for  example
             because of a family or tribal feud,  or  because  of  hostility
             from a particular militia, it is possible to be able safely  to
             travel from one part of Libya to another, depending on  whether
             the reason for the risk is one that would give rise to  further
             risk for that same reason, on encountering a checkpoint.

        (20)  A male seeking  to  avoid  a  local  risk  of  harm  such  as
             described in (19) above, would be able in  practical  terms  to
             relocate to another area of Libya, be it for example Tripoli or
             Benghazi, particularly if  the  person  has  tribal  or  family
             connections there. The absence of such  connections  would  not
             prevent the person from establishing himself, in the  sense  of
             being able to live in the new community and find accommodation.
             It would not be unduly harsh for  such  a  person  to  relocate
             internally.

       (21)   However, such a person may not be able to  avoid  a  risk  of
             harm in a new area where the person has no connections in terms
             of tribal or family links, but the  person  or  group  that  is
             feared  does  have  such  links.  A  fact-specific  enquiry  is
             essential. An appellant's  assertion  that  the  individual  or
             group that is feared has links to say, Tripoli or Benghazi,  or
             another prospective  place  of  relocation,  will  need  to  be
             assessed in the light of the findings in  relation  to  overall
             credibility.

       (22)   In relation to  the  possibility  for  a  woman  to  relocate
             internally, taking  into  account  the  position  of  women  in
             society  in  Libya,  the  difficulty  for  women  of  accessing
             accommodation if alone, and the rarity of a woman arriving in a
             community without knowing any person there, internal relocation
             would not be reasonable and would be unduly harsh unless in the
             prospective area of relocation the woman has a close family  or
             significant  other  connection,  aside  from  merely  a  tribal
             connection.

       (23)   In addition, bearing in mind the above factors,  a  woman  is
             likely to be more conspicuous with the result that her presence
             may more easily be discovered by the prospective persecutor.

       (24)    The following cases are superseded by this decision and  are
             no longer to be treated as providing country guidance:

   RESOLUTION OF THESE APPEALS

   The first appellant-AT

  216. AT is from Souq Al-Juma'a, in Tripoli. The basis of his asylum claim
       was that his father ran an electronics business but also worked  for
       the Qadhafi regime in the Control and Intelligence Service  ("CIS").
       His father stopped working for  the  CIS  but  he  and  others  were
       rounded up by government forces. The appellant was also targeted  by
       pro-Qadhafi forces.  Because of his father's  work  for  the  former
       regime  he  and  his  brothers   were   targeted   by   anti-Qadhafi
       revolutionaries. When he left Libya in 2011  he  believed  that  the
       rebels were still looking for him and his brother.

  217. First-tier Tribunal Judge Mather did not find the  appellant  to  be
       credible. She did not accept that his father  worked  for  the  CIS,
       accepting only that  he  is  a  businessman  running  an  electrical
       business. She did not accept that the appellant had been targeted at
       all, that he had been subjected to persecution in the past, or  that
       he would be persecuted on return.

  218. The grounds of appeal in relation to the decision of the  First-tier
       Tribunal did not  take  issue  with  the  credibility  findings.  We
       proceed on the basis of the First-tier judge's credibility findings,
       it being accepted on the appellant's behalf  that  the  respondent's
       skeleton  argument  correctly  sets  out  the  adverse   credibility
       findings and in respect of which no submissions were made on  behalf
       of the appellant attempting to reopen those findings.

  219. We note that this  appellant  is  from  Souq  Al-Juma'a.  Dr  George
       referred to events   of the Friday before the hearing when  a  large
       number of demonstrators were killed and many wounded by the  Misrata
       militia.  Dr Porter states in his written  evidence  that  Souq  Al-
       Juma'a has its own militia. He also referred to the events  of  that
       Friday,  the  incident  having  taken   place   partially   in   the
       neighbourhood of Souq Al-Juma'a.

  220. In examination-in-chief he said that the appellant, having  ID  from
       Souq Al-Juma'a, puts him at  risk  in  terms  of  contact  with  the
       Misrata militia. He would have to give his  address,  amongst  other
       details, on the disembarkation form at  Tripoli  airport  which  was
       controlled by the Misrata militia.

  221. In cross-examination Dr George said that until  the  events  of  the
       previous weekend he would not have said that a  person  coming  from
       Souq Al-Juma'a would put a person at risk. He said that there  could
       be recriminations from the Misrata brigade against those  from  Souq
       Al-Juma'a who had attacked them. However, he went on to  agree  that
       someone who had been in the UK for the past three years would not be
       seen as someone who had attacked the Misrata  brigade  the  previous
       weekend. He also said that someone from Souq Al-Juma'a going through
       Tripoli airport would not be more at  risk  than  someone  presently
       living in Souq Al-Juma'a. He accepted that his  assessment  of  risk
       was entirely speculative  in  that  it  was  too  early  to  make  a
       judgement about people being subjected to harm on the basis of where
       they are from.

  222. We note that it was not argued on behalf of the appellant AT that he
       would be at risk on the basis of the events on the  previous  Friday
       and his coming from Souq Al-Juma'a. Furthermore, the fact  that  the
       appellant was not in Souq Al-Juma'a at  the  time  of  those  events
       means that it is not reasonably likely that  he  would  be  seen  as
       someone opposed to the Misrata militia.

  223. This appellant's asylum and human rights appeal on the basis of  the
       claimed involvement of his father with the intelligence  service  of
       the former regime was rejected.

  224. For the reasons we have given, the  evidence  does  not  demonstrate
       that  the  appellant  would  be  entitled  to  refugee  eligibility,
       humanitarian protection on the basis of an Article 15(c) risk, or in
       relation to Article 3 in terms of the general security conditions.

  225. No claim under Article 8 of the ECHR was advanced before us.

  226. In the circumstances, the appellant's appeal on asylum, humanitarian
       protection and human rights grounds is to be dismissed.

   The second appellant-AMH

  227. AMH is from Zawiye, close to Tripoli.  He  describes  himself  as  a
       'black Arab', is a Sunni Muslim and is a member of the Bla'za ethnic
       group.

  228. First-tier Tribunal Judge N. Manuel  dismissed  his  appeal  on  all
       grounds. The First-tier judge made certain findings  of  fact  which
       are not infected by the  error  of  law,  Senior  Immigration  Judge
       Storey directing that the primary findings of fact should stand.  It
       was accepted before us that, so far as necessary,  further  findings
       of fact may need to be made.

  229. As to the findings by Judge Manuel, she found that the appellant had
       been opposed to the Qadhafi regime in the past, as he  had  claimed,
       and since his arrival in the UK. She accepted that he was  a  member
       of the Bla'za ethnic group. She referred to a  report  by  Professor
       Joff� which described the H as a sub-clan of the Bla'za.

  230. She accepted that as a Black Libyan he had suffered  discrimination.
       One of the specific  findings  at  [47]  was  that  the  appellant's
       father's car was set on fire during violence directed against  Black
       Libyans in 2000. She noted, however,  that  the  appellant  and  his
       siblings had not been deprived of the opportunity to  attend  school
       and undertake further education,  including  completing  in  2010  a
       three year civil engineering  course  at  the  High  Institution  in
       Zawiye. He had been able to  leave  Libya  three  times:  to  go  to
       Switzerland, Yemen and the UK. He had been  able  to  find  work  in
       Libya.

  231. Judge Manuel found that the appellant's father  had  worked  for  30
       years in the operations department of the military, and despite  the
       fact, as she found, that his family is one of two families from that
       particular ethnic group in Zawiye, they have continued to live in  a
       village just outside Zawiye. She concluded that  the  discrimination
       that  he  and   his   family   suffered   on   account   of   "their
       race/tribe/black origins" could not be described as persecution.

  232. She further found that the appellant's older brother  had  moved  to
       Tripoli about two years prior to the hearing (which was in September
       2011) to avoid problems in Zawiye and that he had managed to  obtain
       employment in Zawiye and Tripoli without difficulty.

  233. Another brother had travelled freely to Saudi Arabia and returned to
       Libya. His brother then went to Yemen and  came  back  to  Libya  in
       2002. He had remained in Libya until 2008 when he went to Egypt.

  234. Judge Manuel  found  that  the  appellant's  claim  that  he  feared
       persecution on account of his ethnicity was undermined by reason  of
       his intention to return to Libya at the end of his course  of  study
       in the UK.

  235. We note that in the appellant's asylum interview he said  in  answer
       to questions 18-21 that his father retired in 1999  after  30  years
       service, with the rank of "sergeant  or  chief  sergeant"  and  that
       during his military service he was based in Zawiye. At question  139
       of the interview he said that his father had been threatened to  the
       effect that even  if  Qadhafi  stepped  down  "your  son"  would  be
       punished by being killed.

  236. The appellant's oral evidence before us was that he  had  spoken  on
       the phone to his wife who said that the family were planning to flee
       Zawiye because they were in fear. He told us  that  he  did  mention
       this phone call to the judge at the hearing of his appeal before the
       First-tier Tribunal.  Ms  Patel  was  able  to  provide  us  with  a
       manuscript copy of the notes of evidence taken by her at the hearing
       before the First-tier Tribunal. They accorded  with  the  First-tier
       judge's record of proceedings on this issue, as we revealed  to  the
       parties before us. The appellant did give evidence to the First-tier
       Tribunal that he had received a phone call from his wife  about  two
       weeks before the hearing, that she appeared scared of the  situation
       in Libya, and did not talk much. However, the records of proceedings
       do not indicate that he said that his wife  had  told  him  she  was
       planning to leave Zawiye. Indeed, Ms Patel's record of the  evidence
       is consistent with Judge Manuel stating in the determination at [40]
       that his family "have continued to live in a  village  just  outside
       Zawiya".

  237. We are not satisfied that the  appellant  did  tell  the  First-tier
       judge that his wife told him in a phone call that  the  family  were
       planning on leaving the area. Not only is this not reflected in  the
       First-tier judge's determination,  it  is  not  a  matter  that  was
       subject to any challenge in respect of the judge's determination. Ms
       Patel was not able to provide us with any notes  of  evidence  which
       would suggest that there was any error  in  the  First-tier  judge's
       narration of the appellant's  evidence  in  the  determination.  The
       grounds of appeal in relation to  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
       Tribunal refer at [11(iv)] to the appellant's family, consisting  of
       his elderly parents, his wife and young children continuing to  live
       just outside Zawiye,  being  too  frightened  to  travel  elsewhere;
       believing it is safer to stay indoors than travel and  being  in  an
       area that they know well  so  that  they  can  hide.  This  is  also
       inconsistent with the appellant's account of having been told by his
       wife that they were planning to leave.

  238. The appellant's evidence was that his friend HH told  him  by  phone
       that various identified tribes are all  using  violence  to  control
       their areas of Zawiye and are all persecuting Black Libyans. As  set
       out in his witness  statement  dated  7  March  2012,  HH  told  the
       appellant that his father had been beaten up by the rebels  and  had
       been taken to hospital and that this happened at the end of  January
       2012. According to the witness statement that was the last  time  he
       had spoken to HH who told him that his family had all left; that  is
       his parents, wife, children,  brothers  and  sisters  and  that  the
       family home is empty. The statement continues that HH  had  been  to
       visit the family and found that the house had been abandoned. He had
       also told him that his cousins  are  in  prison,  accused  of  being
       Qadhafi supporters. Everyone in the appellant's  uncle's  house  had
       fled too.

  239. However, we are  not  satisfied  that  the  appellant  has  given  a
       credible account of having lost contact with all family  members  in
       Libya. He agreed in evidence that his family in Libya had  consisted
       of three brothers and three sisters, uncles and aunts as well as his
       parents, wife and children. As was noted in  cross-examination,  his
       evidence does not include an account  of  having  tried  to  contact
       other members of the family apart from his parents and wife.

  240. We do not accept as reasonably likely his explanation  that  he  did
       not inform other members of the family that he was coming to the UK.
       His further explanation that his brothers, sisters, uncles and aunts
       were living separately and that everyone  is  busy  with  their  own
       lives is similarly not credible in the context of the  situation  in
       Libya in which it is reasonable  to  conclude  that  family  members
       would be concerned to establish the whereabouts or safety  of  other
       family members. Furthermore, the appellant said in evidence that his
       brothers and sisters  also  have  his  phone  number  yet  have  not
       contacted him.

  241. The evidence in relation to his apparent efforts to find his  family
       through the Red Cross does not indicate a genuine  attempt  to  find
       lost family  members,  bearing  in  mind  his  having  cancelled  an
       appointment with  the  Red  Cross  on  20  August  2012  (page  A155
       appellant's bundle). He agreed that the letter from  the  Red  Cross
       dated 7 September 2012 was the last letter  that  he  received  from
       them, although he said  that  he  maintained  contact.  We  are  not
       satisfied, however, that the appellant did maintain contact with the
       Red Cross in the way he  described,  bearing  in  mind  that  it  is
       reasonably likely that confirmation of that contact with the  person
       he named as Sara would have been able to have been provided.

  242.  The lack of credibility in the appellant's account of  having  lost
       contact with his family undermines his claim  that  his  father  was
       beaten up by rebels and that his family have fled Zawiye,  and  that
       his uncle has also fled.

  243.  On behalf of  the  respondent  it  was  submitted  that  given  the
       appellant's evidence that he is a well known opponent of the Qadhafi
       regime and that he and his brother are  leading  lights  locally  in
       terms of opposing the regime, AMH would be well known  in  the  area
       for that reason and would not be at risk of  being  suspected  as  a
       supporter of Qadhafi.

  244. However, that position does not take into account the  long  service
       of the appellant's father in the military for the Qadhafi regime. As
       we have already indicated, the evidence is  to  the  effect  that  a
       sizeable proportion of the population were in  some  way  associated
       with the former regime in terms of  employment.  Such  a  connection
       alone would not create a risk  of  persecution  or  Article  3  ill-
       treatment. The additional and significant factor in the case of  AMH
       is that he is black. Again, that fact alone  does  not  establish  a
       risk requiring international protection.

  245. An enquiry into the appellant's circumstances by those he is  likely
       to encounter  on  return  to  Libya  and  en  route  to  Zawiye,  is
       reasonably likely to reveal his anti-Qadhafi activities  and  views.
       However, there is little basis for confidence in the rationality  of
       the response by the militias to such an enquiry, in the context of a
       Black Libyan whose father had a long association  with  the  Qadhafi
       regime in a military capacity.

  246. Although we are not satisfied that  the  appellant  has  established
       that his family have left Zawiye,  we  do  not  consider  that  this
       provides much of  an  insight  into  the  potential  risk  for  this
       appellant.

  247. We are satisfied that there is a real risk of persecution  for  this
       appellant on return to  Libya  to  his  home  area.  His  return  is
       reasonably likely to be  the  subject  of  enquiry  by  militias  in
       control of Zawiye with the risks attendant in that enquiry.  In  any
       event, we do not consider that he would be able safely to reach  his
       home area. For the same reasons, we are not satisfied that he  would
       be able to available himself of the option of  internal  relocation,
       either to Tripoli, Benghazi or any other part of Libya.

  248. Accordingly, we  are  satisfied  that  he  has  established  to  the
       required standard that he has a well founded fear of persecution  on
       the basis of his imputed political opinion. It follows that  he  has
       also established a risk of ill-treatment contrary to  Article  3  of
       the ECHR.

  249. His appeal is allowed  on  asylum  and  human  rights  grounds  with
       reference to Article 3 of the ECHR.

   The third and fourth appellants-HKA and AE-S

  250. These appellants are  brother  and  sister  and  their  appeals  are
       closely  related.  We  have   nevertheless   given   them   separate
       consideration.

  251. HKA is female and is the sister of the fourth appellant  AE-S.  They
       are both of the Ashwihdi ethnic group and are  both  from  Benghazi.
       The First-tier Tribunal rejected the credibility of the  appellant's
       account  of  her  father  having  been  involved   in   anti-Qadhafi
       activities. The appellant's claim for asylum was also based on  what
       she said were  her  own  anti-regime  activities  when  she  was  at
       university where she distributed anti-Qadhafi leaflets, as  did  her
       brothers. She said that she had attended demonstrations outside  the
       Libyan embassy in London.

  252. First-tier judge Duff concluded that there  is  nothing  to  suggest
       that the appellant would be at risk from the (then)  authorities  on
       the basis of her activities opposing the  regime,  which  activities
       had not come to the attention of the authorities.

  253. AE-S came to the UK at the same time as his sister. His  appeal  was
       heard at the same time as that of HKA. Judge Duff  also  found  that
       there was no reason for this appellant to come to the  attention  of
       the authorities. He also claimed to have attended demonstrations  in
       the UK although the judge did not find credible that  he  had  given
       his name to a person on the demonstration (in the context of members
       of the Qadhafi regime posing as demonstrators  and  taking  people's
       names).

  254. The case for  the  appellants  now,  as  set  out  in  the  skeleton
       argument, is that it would be unsafe for them to return to  Benghazi
       on account of the unstable security  situation  and  the  consequent
       risk of serious harm. They could not safely relocate internally.  It
       is also said they would be at risk as failed asylum seekers, and  on
       the basis  that  they  would  be  perceived  as  having  pro-Qadhafi
       sentiments. The appellants' skeleton argument refers at para 45 to a
       'risk profile' for HKA as including  her  being  from  the  Ashwihdi
       ethnic group, but there was no evidence before  us  to  support  the
       contention that she would be at risk for that reason and it was  not
       a matter that was pursued in oral  submissions.  We  make  the  same
       comments on this issue in relation to AE-S.

  255. In relation to HKA, the fact that she is female is argued as being a
       factor that would increase the risk to her, being at increased  risk
       of being stopped and questioned at  a  checkpoint.  We  accept  that
       there are particular problems for women in Libya but the evidence of
       Dr Porter was that any problems that she may encounter travelling as
       a single female would be alleviated by the fact that  she  would  be
       travelling with her brother.

  256. We are similarly not satisfied that there is a basis from  which  to
       conclude that she could not safely return to Benghazi via Tripoli by
       air, or even by road. It was acknowledged in submissions  before  us
       that she would be returned with HKA.

  257. Applying the guidance we have given above, we do not  consider  that
       there is any basis from which to conclude that either  HKA  or  AE-S
       would be at risk of persecution, serious harm,  or  Article  3  ill-
       treatment on return. For the reasons  we  have  given,  we  are  not
       satisfied that either of them is entitled to humanitarian protection
       on the basis of the general security situation in Libya.

  258. Whilst the security situation in Benghazi is more unstable  than  in
       Tripoli, the expert and country background evidence does not  reveal
       that  these  two  appellants  would  be  unable  to  return   there.
       Similarly, we are not satisfied  that  the  route  of  return,  from
       Tripoli by air, or by road, establishes a risk of harm sufficient to
       engage the Refugee Convention or Article 3.

  259. In the circumstances, neither for AE-S nor for HKA is  it  necessary
       to consider the question of internal relocation. Were  it  necessary
       to consider it, we would have concluded that  each  appellant  would
       have the option of relocating within Tripoli. The evidence before us
       was that it is not unusual for  people  from  Benghazi  to  live  in
       Tripoli and there is no inherent risk associated with  doing  so  on
       account of the fact that the person comes from Benghazi.

  260. In the circumstances, the question of whether either or both of them
       could acquire Egyptian nationality is not a question  that  requires
       resolution.  Although  the  matter  was  not   addressed   in   oral
       submissions by the parties,  at  our  request  we  received  written
       submissions from the parties after the hearing. Given that  this  is
       now not an issue which requires resolution, we need  only  say  that
       there was disagreement between the parties in  relation  to  whether
       either or both of them could acquire Egyptian nationality.  We  note
       that some doubt was expressed by Professor Joff� as to  whether  HKA
       could acquire Egyptian nationality, and we infer that he would  have
       the same doubt in relation to AE-S.

  261. The appeals of HKA and AE-S on asylum, humanitarian  protection  and
       human rights grounds are each dismissed.

   DECISIONS

       In relation to the first appellant, the First-tier Tribunal made  an

Representation:

For the Appellant:     Miss G Patel instructed by Jackson & Cantor
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr P Deller, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS

1. The appellant is a national of  Libya.  He  challenges  the  decision  of
First-tier Tribunal (FTT) Judge Manuel  in  September  2011  dismissing  his
appeal against a decision by the respondent dated 9 June  2011  refusing  to
grant him asylum and giving directions for his removal.

2. It is unnecessary for me to furnish much detail because the parties  were
in agreement with me that the FTT judge materially erred in law.  The  judge
found  that the appellant was a black Libyan and member of the Bla'za  tribe
whose home area was just outside Zawiya and that as a black  Libyan  he  and
his family had suffered  discrimination.  Nevertheless  the  judge  did  not
consider the appellant would be at risk on  return  because,  having  (along
with his family) been involved in  anti-Gadhafi  activities,  the  appellant
"would be able to show he had not  been  a  supporter  of  Gadhafi".  In  so
finding it does not appear that the judge based himself  on  the  background
country information which  on  its  face  appeared  to  suggest  that  black
Libyans were perceived purely on the basis of their  ethnicity  to  be  pro-
Gaddafi and that in the confusing  circumstances  still  prevailing  at  the
date of the hearing, careful individual or rational judgements  by  the  new
regime would not necessarily be made.

3. The FTT's judge's treatment of  Article  15(c)  was  unsatisfactory.  The
appellant had claimed he would be at risk on return to Libya  by  virtue  of
the high level of indiscriminate violence there. The  FTT  judge's  response
at paras 61-62 was to state that:

    "61...Aside from the fact that the SOS has  undertaken  not  to  remove
    failed asylum seekers to Libya at present, I take account of  the  fact
    that the UK government has not accepted, even  at  the  height  of  the
    conflict, that Libya is in a state of internal armed conflict.
    62. I conclude therefore that there are  not  substantial  grounds  for
    believing that the Appellant  would  face  a  real  risk  of  suffering
    serious harm if he is returned to Libya..."


4. With respect to the FTT judge, the fact that the Secretary of  State  had
undertaken not to remove failed asylum seekers to Libya  at  that  time  was
irrelevant  to  his  task.  He  was  obliged  to   consider   the   position
hypothetically in terms of whether, if returned, the appellant would  be  at
risk. Further, the FTT judge  was  not  conducting  a  mere  review  of  the
respondent's decision and so the fact that the respondent did  not  consider
there was an armed conflict in Libya at that  time  was  no  more  than  one
aspect of the evidence and did not without more warrant the conclusion  that
"therefore" the appellant was not at risk.

5. I observe that at the date of hearing there was still a  No-fly  zone  in
force in Libya and fighting was still continuing. It was certainly  arguable
on the available evidence that there was a state of armed  conflict  in  the
country as a whole or parts of it and it is also the case, of  course,  that
in QD (Iraq) the Court of  Appeal  did  not  appear  to  consider  that  for
Article 15(c) to be engaged it was even necessary for there to be  an  armed
conflict; the essential  matter  was  the  existence  of  a  high  level  of
indiscriminate violence.

6. For these two reasons I consider that the FTT judge materially  erred  in
law and that his decision is to be set aside.  I  should  clarify,  however,
that there was no challenge in this case to the judge's primary findings  of
fact, only to his application to those findings of correct  legal  criteria.
Hence his primary findings of fact shall stand.

7. It may assist if I comment  on  a  further  aspect  of  the  FTT  judge's
decision.

8. In his treatment of the issue of risk on return, the FTT  judge  appeared
to consider that the Court of Appeal judgment in  HH  and  Others  (Somalia)
[2010] EWCA Civ 426 established that so long as the precise route of  return
to a country was not ascertainable, it was not necessary  for  the  decision
to deal with whether there would be risk on return arising from the  precise
point of entry. However, in relation to Libya, the reason for the  inability
to identify a point of return was arguably a concern that there was no  safe
part of the country. That being so I consider it at least arguable  that  HH
& Others cannot be prayed in aid to prevent assessment of  risk  on  return.
Further, if it is the case that the  respondent  has  only  ever  identified
Tripoli as a point of return for returnees to Libya (and Tripoli was at  the
relevant time still affected by a no-fly zone),  it  is  at  least  arguable
that there  was  no  proper  basis  for  considering  the  route  of  return
uncertain.

9. I raised with the parties whether this  case  would  be  suitable  to  be
joined with other cases that  have  been  identified  as  potential  country
guidance case on Libya (one of  them  also  having  Jackson  and  Cantor  as
representatives  -  AA/04789/2011  AT).  Both  representatives   said   they
considered this case would be a helpful addition, enabling the  Tribunal  to
consider not just  generic  risk  but  risk  to  significant  categories  of
returnees. I explained to them that the decision on  whether  to  join  this
case would be for the Country Group Convenor but that the parties  would  be
notified one way or the other as soon as possible.

10. For the above reason the FTT judge  materially  erred  in  law  and  his
decision is set aside, with a notice concerning a  continuation  hearing  to
be sent to the parties shortly.

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent



                          DECISION AND  DIRECTIONS


   1.   The appellant is a national of Libya. In a determination notified on
      12 May 2011 the First-tier Tribunal (Immigration Judge Duff) dismissed
      the appellant's appeal against a decision  of  the  respondent  on  24
      March 2011 to refuse to grant asylum and to remove her as  an  illegal
      entrant. Permission to  appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  having  been
      granted,  the  matter  came  before  me  to  decide  whether  the  FTT
      materially erred in law.


   2.   Both parties were in agreement with me that the  IJ  had  materially
      erred in law in failing to  address  the  potential  difficulties  the
      appellant would have on a hypothetical return to Tripoli in early  May
      2011 when the Gaddafi regime was still in power and when it was not in
      dispute that the appellant is from Benghazi and is of the A tribe. The
      IJ based his decision on an assessment of likely risk to the appellant
      on the basis of her return to Benghazi and further on  his  assessment
      that she and her brother "could make a claim for Egyptian nationality,
      because of the nationality of their mother". Given that the respondent
      contemplated return to  Libya  via  Tripoli  the  IJ  was  obliged  to
      consider risk at the point of return and  the  issue  of  whether  the
      Libyan authorities there would have seen her as  of  adverse  interest
      given her place of residence  and  tribe.  Given  that  there  was  no
      evidence to show  that  the  appellant  had  Egyptian  nationality  by
      operation of law, it was also an error for the judge to have  regarded
      that as a reason why the appellant would  not  face  a  real  risk  of
      persecution in Libya.


   3.    Both parties were also  agreed  that  the  above  errors  did  not,
      however, impinge on the IJ's principal findings of fact and indeed the
      challenge raised  against  the  IJ's  decision  was  not  based  on  a
      challenge to credibility. Accordingly the IJ's  findings  of  fact  in
      relation to the appellant shall stand. The  only  accepted  facts  are
      that she is a national of Libya born on 6 November 1979, is a  female,
      is from Benghazi and is from the A tribe.

   4.   In response to questions from me both parties  also  confirmed  they
      were happy for the case to proceed as  an  intended  country  guidance
      case. On current information it is likely to be  joined  to  be  heard
      with  the  case  of  her   brother,   Mr   [AE-S]   reference   number
      AA/04537/2011.

   5.  It was agreed that it would be useful to hear oral evidence  from  Dr
      Joffe assuming he is available on the date fixed for the  hearing.  He
      has already submitted a report but it will obviously need updating.

   6.  The next step will be for the Tribunal to  fix  a  date  for  hearing
      allocating sufficient time for oral evidence from Dr Joffe.

   7.   The  appellant's  representatives   are   directed   to   submit   a
      supplementary report from Dr Joffe at least 5 working days in  advance
      of the date  fixed  for  substantive  hearing.  This  direction  is  a
      complement to standard Tribunal directions.

   8.    Closer to the date fixed for hearing the Tribunal will hold  a  CMR
      hearing to ensure that preparation of materials is in  hand  and  that
      the country guidance issues are  specifically  identified  (given  the
      fast-changing situation presently it would be  premature  to  seek  to
      specify those now, although both parties are aware in general terms of
      the need to examine which categories of person, if any, are likely  to
      face risk on return to Libya at the date of hearing before  the  panel
      who will do the country guidance case).

                                Judge of the Upper Tribunal



                                 APPENDIX C

                            ORAL EVIDENCE OF AMH


   1. In examination-in-chief the appellant adopted his  witness  statements
      dated, 17 August 2011, 7 March 2012 and 9 October, 2013.  In  relation
      to paragraph 8 of the witness statement dated 7 March 2012, there is a
      correction in that it was in the town of Al-Kuffrah  that  there  were
      two tribes.  The town was not called Alkarah.  Altabo should  read  Al
      Tabou.  The names of the tribes have been mistyped in the statement.


   2. In cross-examination he agreed that he had come to the UK  in  October
      2010 as a student but after the revolution began in Libya  he  claimed
      asylum, in May 2011.   He  was  interviewed  in  connection  with  his
      asylum claim and he  made  the  statement  dated  17th  August,  2011,
      reproduced at pages 324 to 342 which he had adopted today.


   3. Before he came to the United Kingdom to study he lived in Zawiya  with
      his wife and five children.  Another child has been born since he  has
      been here.  Before leaving he moved his wife and children to live with
      his parents in a village just outside Zawiya.  His wife  and  children
      were living in the village of Belazi when he made his claim.  Both his
      parents also lived there.  His wife and children were living with  his
      parents.  His children were born in 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006,  2009  and
      one in 2011.  His children are now aged between 2 and 10 years old.


   4. He has four brothers and three sisters.  His brother, AO was living in
      Tripoli when the appellant left.  He had been living there since 2009.
       The appellant's brother, S, lives in Egypt and  he  had  lived  there
      since 2008.  Another brother, H, lives in Zawiya but  separately  from
      his  parents,  and  his  other  brother,  A,  also  lives  in   Zawiya
      separately.  His sister, Se, lives in Zawiya separately and his second
      sister Su lives in Al Ujelad, which is  west  of  Zawiye.   His  third
      sister, A, lives in Tripoli.   He  has  uncles  and  aunts  living  in
      Tripoli, Zawiya and Zuwara.  S is the only member of the family living
      outside Libya.  All the appellant's uncles and aunts are of  the  same
      ethnicity.


   5. The appellant confirmed that he had been in contact  with  his  family
      and friends when he made his claim.  AO at that time was  in  Tripoli.
      He agreed that he had said that his  brother  did  not  have  problems
      there and was better than before.

   6. He was referred to para 33 of the statement which starts at page  324.
      The appellant agreed that his brother AO moved to Tripoli and  in  the
      first sentence of that paragraph he said that his brother has  had  no
      problems in Tripoli.  He agreed that he  went  there  because  he  had
      ethnic problems in his area. He agreed  that  his  brother's  move  to
      Tripoli but that was not without problems.  The appellant agreed  that
      he had not been able to contact his brother since  shortly  before  he
      moved to Tripoli. He was referred to his asylum interview at  question
      226 where he explained that when he had  said  that  his  brother  was
      better than before he was making an assumption based on the fact  that
      he had not heard that he had been having problems from anybody.

   7. To avoid problems his brother was going to  work  and  returning  from
      work and did not go out,  avoiding  problems.  This  was  in  Tripoli.
      Before he came to the United Kingdom he knew his brother had  gone  to
      Tripoli and that was when contact with  him  terminated.  His  brother
      told him about the problems.

   8. He was referred to his witness statement which states that he had  not
      been able to contact his brother since before he went to Tripoli.  The
      appellant explained that he had heard that his  brother  had  problems
      from other members of the family.  The family  had  told  him  of  his
      problems in Tripoli and they got this from him. He was referred to his
      evidence moments earlier when he said that his brother had told him of
      his problems, and the appellant agreed that that was the case.

   9. He was referred to para 46 of the same witness statement of 17  August
      2011 where he said that at that date his family were still staying  at
      his parents' house near Zawiye, not because it was  safe  but  because
      they were scared to travel. The remainder of the paragraph was put  to
      him.

  10. The appellant agreed that that was what he had said.  They think it is
      safer to stay wherever they are indoors rather than to travel.  He was
      then referred to what he had said in his second statement at paragraph
      4 and he agreed with the contents.  He  agreed  that  his  family  had
      continued to live in the village just outside Zawiye with his parents,
      as had been found by the Immigration  Judge,  where  his  parents  had
      always lived.

  11. It is true that the last time he had spoken to his wife was two  weeks
      before the full hearing, around 20 August.   During  the  conversation
      his wife had told him that rebels had started to take revenge  against
      black people because it was assumed that  they  had  all  fought  with
      Gaddafi and that he had not spoken to her since.

  12. He agreed that it was alarming to hear that his wife and  family  were
      planning to escape and leave their home.  This news  came  only  three
      days after the first witness statement.  His first  witness  statement
      was on 17th August, 2011 and it was around 20th August, 2011  when  he
      spoke to his wife.  The appellant said that he  signed  his  statement
      and then went to court, but  it  was  adjourned.   It  was  after  the
      adjournment that this contact  happened.   People  involved  with  the
      revolution entered the area and problems started.

  13. The appellant agreed that  it  was  an  upsetting  telephone  call  to
      receive and he had not been able to make contact with his wife  again.
      The hearing before the judge had taken place  two  weeks  later.   The
      appellant insisted that he had told  the  judge  about  the  telephone
      call.  It was pointed out to the appellant that  the  judge  had  said
      that his family remained  in  Zawiya.   It  was  pointed  out  to  the
      appellant that even when he applied for permission to  appeal  to  the
      Upper Tribunal his grounds of appeal stated that his  family  remained
      living in Zawiya.  He was referred to the grounds dated October  2011.
      21. The appellant maintained that he told the Immigration Judge  about
      the call from his wife. Since October 2011 he did not know  where  the
      family went to until a friend called HH contacted  him  who  told  him
      that his family went away. He spoke to him when he, HH, was  in  Libya
      but he does not know where he is now because all his contacts are cut.
      He spoke to him in January 2012 and he was in Libya up to that point.

  14. He was referred to his witness statement dated March 2012 at  para  5.
      (We quote that paragraph of the statement in full:

             "I was also in touch with my friend HH by telephone.   HH  told
             me that there were four tribes who are in control of  different
             areas of Zawiya; Awlad  Salkar,  Awlad  Sowlah,  Awlad  Ajinah,
             Iwlad Abdulmula.  He told me that sometimes these  tribes  work
             together and sometimes they fight each other, but they are  all
             using violence to keep control of their areas  of  Zawiya,  and
             they are all persecuting black Libyans.  HH  told  me  that  my
             father had been beaten up by  the  rebels.   He  said  that  my
             father had been taken to hospital and this was at  the  end  of
             January 2012.  That is the last I spoke to HH.  He told me that
             the rebels came to my father's house in Zawiya and beat him and
             that my wife and children have fled Zawiya,  he  did  not  know
             where they had gone.  All my family have left,  my  father,  my
             mother, wife, children, brothers and  sisters.   The  house  is
             completely empty.  HH has been to  visit  them  and  found  the
             house been abandoned.")

  15. As to whether up until that point his family had stayed in Zawiye,  he
      does not know as this is what H told him. He said they are not  there.
      They were there when the rebels came to the house and beat his father.



  16. It was put to the appellant that on this account his family had stayed
      in Zawiya up until January 2012.  He  said  he  believed  they  stayed
      until August 2011.  He received a call from his wife saying that  they
      were all planning to escape.  The call lasted for five minutes and she
      was scared.  He did not know where they stayed until he  was  told  by
      HH.

  17. He agreed that he had contacted the Red Cross.  He  had  lost  contact
      with all his family members.  It was put to the appellant that he  had
      not mentioned in his witness statement having lost  contact  with  his
      brothers and sisters.  He explained that they all  had  his  telephone
      number. As to why he had not mentioned in his witness  statement  that
      he had lost contact with  his  brothers  and  sisters,  there  was  no
      contact but they have his telephone number.

  18. The appellant was then referred to page 158 in relation to his contact
      with the Red Cross.  S is his wife,  Mu  is  his  father,  Ma  is  his
      mother, H is his daughter and A is his son.   He  was  asked  why  the
      letter only referred to these members of his family and he said he had
      meant all his family, especially his  parents.   He  was  referred  to
      pages 156 and 155 of the bundle.  He explained that he had no  further
      documentation because one of the people is called Sarah and he has met
      her more than once at a place where she meets asylum seekers  and  she
      has said that there is no news.

  19. He was referred to para 42 of his witness statement  dated  17  August
      2011, in relation to his claim that people had been arrested in  Libya
      as a result of his encouraging them to demonstrate. He agreed that the
      paragraph was accurate. HH told him that the reasons his friends H and
      J had been arrested because of  him.  This  is  the  same  HH  he  had
      previously referred to. They had been actively  demonstrating  against
      Qadhafi.  The appellant had encouraged them by  phone  to  demonstrate
      more.  The appellant did not know when they were arrested  because  he
      was not there.  HH was warning the appellant about  going  back.   The
      appellant had been one of the reasons why H and J had  been  arrested.
      HH remained in Libya until the appellant's last call in January 2012.

  20. It was pointed out to the appellant that he had said that HH had fled.
      The appellant responded by saying that HH went to  Tunisia.   He  went
      there to make calls and then went back.  He received a  call  from  HH
      while events were taking place.  It was some time before 17th  August,
      2011 and the appellant did not know when HH returned.

  21. The appellant said that he had said that HH remained in Libya  because
      he was there the last time he had spoken to him. It  was  put  to  the
      appellant that his account was contradictory in terms of the level  of
      contact with family and friends in Libya.  The appellant said  he  did
      not understand why it was said to be contradictory.  It was  only  one
      person he knew who had spoken to him and the second time was his wife.
       It was suggested to him that he had a wide number of family in  Libya
      apart from his wife and friends.  He  had  three  brothers  and  three
      sisters, uncles and aunts. However, he does not appear to  have  given
      any information about his efforts to contact them. The appellant  said
      that when he came to the United Kingdom he did not inform any of  them
      that he was coming.  Everyone was scared and black  people  especially
      were being targeted because they cannot really speak.

  22.  Even if his brothers and sisters, uncles and aunts knew that  he  was
      coming here, they were all living  separately.   They  could  get  his
      telephone number from his wife or anyone  else.  As  to  his  previous
      evidence that they had his number, did not have  all  the  numbers  to
      contact everyone.

  23. It was suggested that if his account  was  true  he  would  have  made
      efforts to find out from his  wider  family  what  had  happened.  The
      appellant said that his account was true.  His wife was not  a  Libyan
      citizen so he could not contact her family. He  was  thinking  of  his
      family and he was worried and because of this he has become  diabetic.
      It was HH who told him about his family. Again it was suggested to him
      that if he had been worried and anxious to find his  family  after  20
      August 2011 it would have  been  possible  by  one  of  those  routes,
      particularly his family in Zawiye, to find out that they had  remained
      in his father's house at least until January 2012. The appellant  said
      that HH was the closest to him and he contacted him and  he  told  him
      about what had taken place.

  24. In re-examination he said that Zawiye is 45-50  kilometres  away  from
      Tripoli, and HH went to Tunisia and then returned.  Tunisia is  70  to
      100 kilometres away from Zawiye.  The appellant's wife is from  Yemen.



  25. In answer to questions from the Tribunal he said that that he had  not
      tried to make any contact with his  wife's  family  in  Yemen  to  see
      whether they might have heard from her because he does not have  their
      telephone number. He does know their address but had  not  written  to
      them as there are troubles in Yemen as well and that the post was  not
      working. As to whether he had made any contact  with  his  brother  in
      Egypt, he has no telephone number or address for him.

  26. In further cross-examination he said that his brother was not a famous
      preacher  in  Egypt  but  a  normal  person.  He  was  only   studying
      engineering in Egypt.  He was referred to  the  witness  statement  of
      ESMA (page 344). His brother,  S,  had  been  a  famous  preacher  and
      advised people on Sharia law before he went  to  Egypt.  He  met  that
      witness in Bournemouth.

  27. The appellant said that before his brother went to Egypt this  witness
      had known the appellant's brother but there was no contact between the
      appellant and  his  brother  now.   The  witness  had  not  given  the
      appellant his brother's telephone number. He did not ask him  for  his
      brother's number.

  28. As to how it was that his brother was a famous  Sheikh  in  Libya  but
      went to being just  an  engineering  student  in  Egypt,  he  was  not
      entirely sure what his  brother  was  studying.   He  thought  it  was
      engineering.  His brother went to Egypt to study  before  events  took
      place in Libya.

  29. In answer to a further question put by the Tribunal in relation to the
      witness statement of ESMA (page 344) who states that  the  appellant's
      brother had had serious problems in Libya and had to flee to Egypt, it
      may be that the government was making it hard for him and which is why
      he thought of going to Egypt to study but he did  not  go  during  the
      troubles.  He did not know that, as the witness statement says,  Mr  A
      had spoken to his brother twice. He was not aware that this was in  Mr
      A's witness statement. He knew that he knows his brother  and  was  in
      contact with his brother. As to why he did not contact his brother  in
      Egypt to see if he had any news of his family. Mr A left  the  UK  and
      the appellant has lost all contact with him.

  30. In answer to further questions in re-examination he said that his wife
      is a Yemeni citizen and ethnically she  is  "close  to  black".   When
      asked if he would explain what he meant he said that she was nearer to
      black than she would be to white in terms of  her  skin  colour.   Her
      father is black but her mother is mixed race like his wife.

                               EXPERT EVIDENCE



THE EXPERT EVIDENCE

     1. The following is a summary of the expert evidence, as contained  in
        the written reports and in the oral evidence. In addition to  their
        written reports, the experts  gave  written  answers  to  questions
        submitted on behalf of the respondent. We have not summarised those
        parts of the experts' reports which have been brought up to date by
        later reports or where information is already contained within, and
        is consistent with, other of the expert reports.

        Dr Alan George

     2. Dr Alan George has provided three reports dated 20 March 2012 and 2
        October 2013, although the second of the reports amalgamates and up-
        dates the first. He provided responses to the Secretary of  State's
        written questions in the third report dated 31 October 2013.

     3. We note that his up-dated report proceeds  on  the  basis  of  AT's
        claim that he would be targeted  as  the  son  of  an  intelligence
        officer. However, as we have noted, that aspect of the  appellant's
        claim was not  found  to  be  credible  by  the  First-tier  judge.
        Nevertheless, that issue does not detract from the expert  evidence
        contained in the report.

     4. Putting current events in Libya  into  context  he  gives  a  brief
        overview of the Qadhafi regime and  sets  out  the  events  of  the
        uprising. We note that he  states  that  Qadhafi's  forces  largely
        comprised foreign mercenaries although in oral evidence he accepted
        that that was probably an overstatement of the position.  He  would
        now put  it  in  terms  of  Qadhafi's  forces  "including"  foreign
        mercenaries.

     5. On 23 October  2011  the  chairman  of  the  Transitional  National
        Council ("NTC") declared Libya to be liberated and the  war  to  be
        over. The report explains the post-Qadhafi political landscape.

     6. In relation  to  security  issues  at  paragraph  42  he  describes
        security conditions since the fall of the Qadhafi regime as  having
        been "chaotic and occasionally dangerous" and that de facto control
        is exerted by numerous local militias that operate  checkpoints  at
        the entrances to  their  territories,  paying  lip-service  to  the
        national authorities. He  refers  in  the  same  paragraph  to  the
        detention of actual or suspected Qadhafi loyalists as having been a
        priority with consequent ill-treatment and  torture  of  detainees,
        several of whom have died.

     7. He reports that "generally peace has prevailed" but that there have
        been frequent, albeit short-lived  "flare-ups"  involving  conflict
        between the militias. Progress towards the formation of a  national
        judicial system, police force and army has been painfully slow. The
        security vacuum has allowed extremist Islamist factions to  operate
        largely unchecked with Sufi mosques and  shrines  being  destroyed,
        and Western targets including US and British diplomats having  been
        attacked.

     8. Dr George quotes from a report by the International Crisis Group of
        14 September 2012 which refers to Libya as a country of regions and
        localities pulling in different directions, beset by inter-communal
        strife and where well-armed local groups  freely  roam,  but  where
        "local actors" have stepped in to provide safety, mediate  disputes
        and impose ceasefires. This being necessary in  the  absence  of  a
        fully functioning state without effective army or police.

     9. Under the heading "Local protection" he states that he knows of  no
        evidential basis that would support an assertion that a  person  in
        need of protection in Libya could expect effective assistance  from
        the local authorities (de jure and de facto), as yet there being no
        effective national police force  or  army  and  with  the  judicial
        system being "non-functional".

    10. With reference to various sources Dr George provides  a  sample  of
        violent  incidents  between  October  2011  and   September   2013,
        numbering about 80, since the fall of the Qadhafi regime, stressing
        that these are just examples. There is  further  reference  to  the
        various militias that operate in the country.

    11. At para 60 under the heading "Allegation and suspicion"  he  states
        that a major  factor  in  personal  security  is  the  tendency  of
        militiamen to make snap judgements about persons' background and/or
        loyalties. He suggests that a person can be at risk merely  because
        of a suspicion, by association, or by a perception that the  person
        must have been for or against the Qadhafi regime. He describes this
        in part as arising from a "strong propensity" in Libya "as  in  the
        Middle East generally" to confuse supposition with hard fact.

    12. Under the heading "Revenge and blood feuds" it is  emphasised  that
        the family, extended family and tribe are the fundamental units  of
        Libyan society, that revenge is a central feature of Libyan culture
        and that revenge attacks can be directed not only against  specific
        individuals but also against their extended families.

    13. The matter of blood feuds is not directly relevant to the issues to
        be determined in these appeals. We note, however, that it  is  said
        at para 66 that in recent years tribalism, whilst still  important,
        has become less significant than it had been in the past. Dr George
        goes on to state that  while  particular  tribes  have  traditional
        territories where they are the dominant element in the  population,
        most if not all Libyan communities have a populace that is at least
        to  some  extent  mixed.  In  the  largest  cities  a   significant
        proportion of the population never belonged to any  tribe.  On  the
        other hand, it is stated that with the uprising against the Qadhafi
        regime there has been a general resurgence of primordial  loyalties
        to family, clan, tribe and locality.

    14. There is an extract from the US State Department Report  for  Libya
        ("USSDR") for 2012 which refers to the  "new  authorities"  lacking
        the capacity and a basic legal framework to fully protect civil and
        judicial rights and that the most significant human rights problems
        during the year resulted from the absence of effective justice  and
        security institutions. The  report  also  describes  various  human
        rights abuses and states that  "Hostility  to  real  and  perceived
        Qadhafi loyalists permeated the country, the principal  targets  of
        which  were  actual  or  suspected  former  Qadhafi   soldiers   or
        supporters."

    15. During the course of the hearing Dr George provided a very  helpful
        supplemental note in relation to the term "Wasta" which  he  refers
        to in his report. "Wasta" in summary is described as the collective
        name for the system of attaining objectives by means of the payment
        of bribes and/or  by  the  utilisation  of  personal  contacts  and
        favours, such informal connections  often  taking  precedence  over
        formal procedures or laws. In his  main  report  he  describes  how
        under the Qadhafi regime and perhaps even more so since,  with  the
        breakdown of central  state  structures,  a  system  of  power  and
        influence based on tribe and  family  permeates  the  country.  The
        tribe and extended family, or clan, remain the key social  economic
        and political units to whom  loyalty  lies  in  preference  to  the
        state. Government corruption  coupled  with  favouritism  based  on
        family and tribal ties were perceived to be severe problems.

    16. In describing the outlook for Libya there is  reference  to  strong
        tribal and regional loyalties, a country "awash" with arms and with
        seasoned fighters, very many of whom are ill-disciplined  and  ill-
        educated. Revenge is a key element in Libyan culture  and  numerous
        autonomous militias, often antagonistic towards each other and some
        linked to the authorities, wield power on  the  ground.  He  states
        that in almost all Libya local militias are far more powerful  than
        the authorities.

    17. Dr George concludes his assessment of the outlook for  the  country
        in stating that although the largely successful elections  of  July
        2012 were cause for optimism, the instability which is  often  very
        violent, is likely to persist until the new authorities  manage  to
        establish functioning police  forces  and  a  disciplined  national
        army. That, he states, is not likely to happen for many months.

    18. In assessing the potential risk  to  AT,  Dr  George,  as  we  have
        observed, proceeds on the basis of AT's  account  of  his  father's
        work for the Intelligence Department of the Board of Control  under
        Colonel Qadhafi which was not found to be  credible.  Going  on  to
        refer to the risk that that appellant may otherwise face he  states
        that he would be at risk because of the security situation but that
        in his view the risk of his being "adversely affected by  outbreaks
        of violence would not be high".

    19. In considering internal flight the report states that in  his  view
        no  part  of  Libya  is  presently  immune  to  the  violence   and
        insecurity. He observes  that  internal  flight  in  Libya  can  be
        problematic. Although the country is large, some 95 per cent of  it
        is arid, uninhabited desert and in relation  to  its  size  it  has
        relatively few populated areas. It has some 6  million  inhabitants
        of whom about 75 per cent reside along the coast.

    20. Families, extended families, religious and ethnic groups  form  the
        basis of Libyan society and people in such  communities  display  a
        strong  tendency  to  live  together  in  relatively   well-defined
        districts, looking  to  their  immediate  communities  for  social,
        economic and political support. Against that background  he  states
        that "it is neither  the  general  practice  nor  is  it  easy  for
        individuals to relocate to parts of Libya remote  from  members  of
        their families and communities." People tend to know  their  fellow
        residents and newcomers  attract  attention.  Residents  and  local
        militias tend to be curious about the background of  newcomers  and
        to ask questions. He states that by  means  of  tribal  contacts  a
        pursuer can locate his quarry with relative ease. In  this  respect
        he refers to Libyan clans often being allied  with  others  forming
        intricate networks that can extend over large areas and will  often
        have members in widely  disparate  locations.  Individuals  can  be
        located relatively easily because of the nature of  Libyan  society
        and newcomers to an area cannot easily live anonymously.

    21. Dr George emphasises  that  attitudes  towards  former  members  of
        Colonel Qadhafi's security agencies do not vary from  one  part  of
        Libya to another.

    22. In his third report dated  31  October  2013  in  response  to  the
        questions about the judicial system, whilst standing by what is  in
        his previous reports, he states  that  disparate  elements  of  the
        system  do  function  in  an  ad  hoc  manner,  with   geographical
        variations  and  variations  in  the  specific  area  of   judicial
        activity.  However, there is no  "coherent,  reliable,  nationally-
        effective judicial system. Thus, he  concludes  that  the  judicial
        system is in that general sense "non-functional".

    23. In relation to the International Criminal Court's ("ICC")  decision
        of 11 October 2013 that Libya was  not  unable  to  carry  out  the
        prosecution of Abdulla  Al-Senussi  (former  Director  of  Military
        Intelligence under Qadhafi), this in  Dr  George's  view  does  not
        constitute support for the contention that Libya  has  a  coherent,
        reliable and nationally effective  judicial  system.  There  is  no
        reason to doubt that the particular legal facilities that  are  the
        subject of the Al-Senussi case are functioning  in  a  manner  that
        satisfied  the  ICC.  Equally,  however,  that  could   easily   be
        interrupted if a sufficiently powerful local militia had  cause  to
        intervene. He cites the example of the prime minister  having  been
        abducted and detained on 10 October 2013. Dr George cites parts  of
        the ICC's judgment  which  is  said  to  focus  on  the  particular
        circumstances of the Al-Senussi trial.

    24. As regards the decision that all 31 Qadhafi era officials are to be
        committed for trial, he states again that there is no  dispute  but
        that certain courts are functioning in Libya. However, he  suggests
        that it is crucial to note that one of those officials is Saif  al-
        Islam, Colonel Qadhafi's eldest son, who remains  in  detention  by
        the local Zintan militia. He cites a press report  which  indicates
        that Saif was not  delivered  to  any  of  the  pre-trial  hearings
        despite his captors being ordered to produce him.

    25. As to the question concerning the "effectiveness and development of
        the trial monitoring network" about which there was a report  dated
        8 October 2013, Dr George refers  to  a  Trial  Monitoring  Network
        established in June 2013. In quoting from the report he notes  that
        it has evidently  faced  challenges  in  achieving  its  objectives
        including difficulties in establishing its presence  in  Libya  and
        gaining entry to courts.

    26. Commenting on the Transitional Justice law and the report on it, he
        reaffirmed that laws passed by Parliament may not be  respected  by
        the militias that are the de facto authorities, and noted  that  as
        far as he was aware Parliament had not yet taken the final vote  on
        the law. As the law had yet to be "promulgated", the  planned  Fact
        Finding and Reconciliation Board had not yet been  established  and
        no compensation had yet been paid to victims.

    27.  Lastly,  in  relation  to  the  report   on   the   progress   and
        implementation of the torture, kidnapping and  discrimination  law,
        although  that  law  has  been  passed,  as  with  all  other  laws
        implementation is hampered  by  the  extremely  limited  extent  of
        government control. De facto control is held  by  scores  of  local
        militias who have scant respect for laws passed by a Parliament  to
        which their loyalty is only nominal, and in relation  to  which  he
        cites security council briefings dated 18  June  and  16  September
        2013 from Tarek Mitri the Special Representative of the  Secretary-
        General and Head of the UN  Support  Mission  in  Libya  ("UNSMIL")
        which concerns conflict-related detentions.




   Dr George-oral evidence

    28. Dr George's oral evidence was given over two non-consecutive  days.
        In examination-in-chief he said that he had recently seen a  figure
        of 1,700 for the number of militias in Libya.  Some  militias  have
        undertaken policing services although the links to  the  government
        ministry may often only be nominal.  An organisation  called  Libya
        Shield was set up by the government to co-opt militias  to  act  on
        behalf of the government because central government has no power of
        its own and has to rely on the militias. It is an attempt to  bring
        the  militias  into  the  fold  by  paying  salaries  and   issuing
        instructions which they may or may not obey.

    29. He referred to the issue of loyalty to the Libyan state as  against
        tribal, local or other loyalties. The  militias  have  no  powerful
        motive to disband. The harsh reality is that "power flows from  the
        barrel of a gun".

    30. If one drives out of Tripoli and along the coast  to  Misrata  each
        village and town has a series of checkpoints. Misrata  has  a  very
        big checkpoint. He had tried to visit the town of Tawurga  but  the
        exit point checkpoint prevented him.  In Tripoli it is possible  to
        move around and then suddenly a checkpoint will  appear,  something
        that he witnessed. If there is a (local) crisis,  the  locals  will
        come out and man a checkpoint. In Tripoli he went out shopping  and
        saw women and children shopping.  There  was  a  strange  normality
        behind it all.

    31. There are a series of militias co-ordinated by the Tripoli Military
        Council ("TMC"). In fact there are two  of  these  TMC's  operating
        from the same premises and he in fact spoke  to  their  leader.  He
        later stated that the Defence  Ministry  has  links  to  the  Libya
        Shield. The Interior Ministry has links  to  the  Supreme  Security
        Committee ("SSC"). The militias  came  into  Tripoli  and  did  not
        leave. One is the Zintan militia  and  the  other  is  the  Misrata
        militia.  They established a presence in Tripoli and did not budge.



    32. In relation to his report at paras 91-92 where he refers  to  close
        communities, there is no straightforward answer as to whether  this
        applies in Tripoli. Residents of the cities, including Tripoli, are
        migrants from particular areas. They tend to conglomerate but there
        is more mixing than in the villages. People do, however,  know  who
        is in their neighbourhood. He had checked last year in a suburb for
        the relatives of a particular asylum applicant.  The  local  people
        knew exactly who they were talking about. In Tripoli the population
        is, however, much more fluid; not the same as in a poorer area.

    33. People from Benghazi do live in Tripoli. He said that he  does  not
        know, however, whether they live in discreet communities and is not
        aware of any studies having been undertaken in relation to this.

    34. It would be unusual for anyone to come to Tripoli  without  knowing
        anyone. When he goes to Tripoli he makes sure that he has  contacts
        in place. Someone going to Tripoli without going through a  network
        would be noteworthy but this has to  be  put  into  context.  If  a
        person is in a small village and says that they come from such  and
        such a place in Tripoli, someone in the village would know  someone
        and be able  to  find  out  about  that  person.  Cities  are  more
        anonymous. In  the  suburbs  of  Tripoli  the  curiosity  would  be
        intensified as in insecure situations this could  be  a  matter  of
        life and death.  He is not able to answer as to whether  a  persons
        'story' is checked through networks. As a general comment he  would
        say sometimes, yes.

    35. A figure of 8,000 is often used as to the number of  detainees.  To
        the best of his knowledge detentions are still continuing  but  not
        on a massive scale. He could only say that it could be that someone
        in detention would for that reason be perceived as a  supporter  of
        Qadhafi. It  is  very  difficult  with  Libya  to  give  definitive
        answers. There are so many courses of action that could arise  from
        a particular situation. There is a lack of research and figures. At
        a checkpoint you might often be dealing with  uneducated  teenagers
        with Kalashnikovs. It may come down to whether they are in  a  good
        mood or if they like your face.

    36.  In  relation  to  recent  events  (involving   the   shooting   of
        demonstrators by the Misrata militia) in Tripoli, he  did  not  see
        this as representing  any  fundamental  change  in  the  situation.
        Nothing very new happened to precipitate the weekend's events.

    37. In cross-examination Dr George confirmed that he had visited  Libya
        in December 2008 and in September 2012. The visits were  mostly  to
        Tripoli but he did make quite extensive trips to Misrata and to the
        Nafusa Mountains. He agreed that some parts of the 2  October  2013
        report are from the previous report but this is  nevertheless  part
        of the history of Libya.  He had not been provided with a  copy  of
        the determination of the First-tier Tribunal in relation to AT.

    38. In relation to the violent incidents  that  he  catalogues  in  his
        report, he said that he was very struck by the extreme localisation
        of events. Violent upheavals can be disparate in type and event. It
        was put to Dr George that the violent  incidents  that  he  details
        could be put into roughly six categories. These were  suggested  as
        being: firstly, confrontations between different ethnic  groups  or
        groups from  different  regions;  secondly,  politically  motivated
        violence  especially  when  groups  take  installations;   thirdly,
        Islamist violence; fourthly, criminal violence;  fifthly,  targeted
        assassinations or bombings which may overlap with category  two  or
        three; sixthly, attacks on peaceful demonstrators by militia.

    39.  In  terms  of  the  first  category,   with   reference   to   the
        confrontations in Kufra between February and July 2012, it could be
        that July 2012 is the last of them but violence  could  arise  next
        week say. The confrontation  pre-dates  the  Qadhafi  era.   It  is
        difficult to say what the prospects for renewed violence  in  Kufra
        are  because  nothing  is  resolved  and  the  militias  are   ill-
        disciplined. The smallest incident could set it off again. The same
        is true in Tarhuna,  east  of  Tripoli.  The  clash  between  rival
        militias in Sabha involving the  black  African  ethnic  group  the
        Toubou referred to on page 15 of the report is the last  report  of
        such an incident in Sabha although it could flare up again  at  any
        time.

    40. Dr George agreed that other incidents to which he was referred were
        examples of groups that bore a grudge against each other over long-
        standing disputes where there was vying for control  of  the  local
        economy.  However,  the  incident  near   Bani   Walid   (involving
        government controlled forces and militiamen-page 18 of the  report)
        was mixed with questions of support for the  former  regime.  Kufra
        could also have involved that issue as a  trigger  but  he  is  not
        saying that it  was.  It  is  normal  that  a  person's  actual  or
        perceived position vis-�-vis the Qadhafi regime is important.

    41. Dr George said that he did not necessarily  accept  the  categories
        that have been suggested. He would have preferred  to  undertake  a
        categorisation with more detailed research.

    42. In relation to the second category, referred to an  incident  (page
        16) of clashes at Tripoli airport in June 2012 he agreed  that  the
        response of the militia to a particular grievance was to occupy the
        airport.

    43. The real power at the airport  in  Tripoli  lies  with  the  Zintan
        militias, a nominally government force. He had been told that  when
        the government took over security  at  the  airport  some  militias
        simply put on a government uniform. When asked about other specific
        incidents he agreed that such violence disappears as quickly as  it
        arises but added that it would then reappear somewhere else.

    44. Referred to various incidents that are said  to  be  in  the  fifth
        category of  violence,  being  targeted  attacks  against  security
        forces, Dr George agreed that there were many attacks of that type.
        Benghazi has been a particular focus of  that  type  of  attack  or
        killing and people have  been  professionally  targeted.  He  said,
        however, that he would be extremely  cautious  about  extrapolating
        from his report (setting out various incidents  of  violence)  what
        was the evolution of different types of incidents of violence. Some
        of them carry the seeds of their evolution internally. For example,
        if you destroy a Sunni mosque there is no longer a Sunni mosque  to
        destroy and therefore there is a decrease in that type of incident.



    45. In relation to the risk of  indiscriminate  violence,  he  did  not
        think that everyone in Libya, just by reason of being there, is  at
        risk of being killed. He said that he does not visit  places  where
        he is at risk of being killed. Women and children were out shopping
        and he was out shopping. He would not hesitate  to  walk  about  in
        Misrata or Zintan. He might think (more) about  going  to  Benghazi
        but   a   targeted   assassination   takes   some   planning.   The
        assassinations in Benghazi appear to be well planned. The  risk  of
        an ordinary Libyan being caught in a bomb explosion  in  cross-fire
        between militias is rather low.

    46. The Tripoli incident where demonstrators were shot  at  by  militia
        did not start with that demonstration but in a previous exchange of
        fire between militias.

    47. Ordinary Libyans have little  truck  with  militias  but  they  are
        powerless. Although the Misrata elders  have  distanced  themselves
        from the militias what that means in the long term  remains  to  be
        seen. If the Misrata militias calculate  that  it  serves  them  to
        withdraw from Misrata they will.

    48. There have been attempts to police the roles of  militia  operating
        in  Tripoli.  They  do  serve  as  police  forces  by  safeguarding
        neighbourhoods, directing traffic and  trying  to  ensure  law  and
        order. Not all militias are out of control. They  run  the  airport
        and at times  are  enlisted  by  the  government,  but  as  already
        mentioned, there are limitations for example if their own interests
        are threatened.  They  do  have  quite  sophisticated  command  and
        control structures and organised hierarchies. It does not mean that
        they are highly disciplined groups but they are not totally out  of
        control.

    49. The  militias  protect  the  civil  populace  and  such  state-like
        institutions of structures as there are and the populace generally.
        That, however, can all go out of the window as tensions arise. Most
        of the time to date by no means has Libya been in a constant  state
        of armed conflict, but that can go out of the window  very  rapidly
        as soon as militia interests come into play and conflict with those
        of State authorities.

    50. There has been a shift in  the  pattern  of  detentions  from  2011
        onwards. When there were a lot  of  ex-Qadhafi  fighters  at  large
        there were more people to arrest. Once  all  the  obvious  suspects
        were arrested the rate  of  arrests  tapered  off.  If  someone  is
        behaving suspiciously  at  a  checkpoint  they  are  likely  to  be
        arrested. Most individuals from  the  Qadhafi  era  have  fled  the
        country or have been detained and there are therefore fewer arrests
        on grounds of sympathy for Qadhafi. A person is more likely now  to
        be arrested on the basis of suspected criminality or  as  suspected
        Islamist.

    51. There are categories, for example Black Libyans, who were  expelled
        from the town of Tawurga who may be detained just  because  of  who
        they are. His source is a friend who is posted  to  the  UNHCR  and
        produces a bulletin of  problems  faced  by  displaced  persons.  A
        particular fear is in relation  to  those  displaced  from  Tawurga
        which is a town near Misrata mainly inhabited by Black Libyans said
        to  be  sympathisers  of  Qadhafi.  African  migrant  workers   are
        frequently  detained  by  anti-Qadhafi  militias  as  he  allegedly
        recruited mercenaries on a large scale. This plugs into  the  deep-
        seated racism in Libya.

    52. A Black Libyan is of black African appearance. The Tibu  are  black
        African. There are no figures for the percentage of  Black  Libyans
        in Libya. In his opinion it may amount to 5 or 10 per cent  of  the
        coastal population, although on reflection 10 per  cent  may  be  a
        little on the high side. It may be 30 per cent in Kufra and 20  per
        cent in Sabha in the south west, although again the  latter  figure
        may be rather high.

    53. Dr George said that he was not sure that he would  agree  that  the
        attention to Qadhafi related people is mostly motivated by revenge.
        The leanings of the militias have little changed.  They  would  say
        that it is not revenge but preventing the resurgence of the regime.
        There is still a fervour to hunt down Qadhafi loyalists.

    54. As to why someone such  as  the  appellant  AT  would  attract  any
        attention at a checkpoint, Dr George said that he would have to  be
        highly speculative. If, for example, someone is nervous that may be
        enough, or if their documents were not in  order.  Another  example
        may be if the person is alleged  to  have  been  a  member  of  the
        security forces who committed abuses. Libya is not a country  where
        there are a set of rules and regulations in force. If there  is  an
        18 year old with a Kalashnikov dealing with  a  particular  person,
        whether an individual was or would be suspected of association with
        the Qadhafi regime or is a relative of such,  will  depend  on  the
        particular circumstances.

    55. So far as 'relatives' are concerned, he derives that  opinion  from
        the nature of Libyan and Middle Eastern society. He  is  unable  to
        show a particular case of such an event in relation to  a  relative
        but he has not looked for one.  Dr  George  did  however  cite  the
        example of the enquiries he made  in  Tripoli  in  relation  to  an
        asylum applicant who said that his brothers  were  members  of  the
        security forces. His researcher spoke to people  in  the  area  who
        confirmed what he had said about his brothers and that  they  raped
        people. The neighbours said that this individual  would  be  killed
        (if he went back).

    56. Tawurgans who are Black Libyans can have trouble at checkpoints. As
        to how they would be identified, they would be asked for  their  ID
        documents or the individual may say that they  are  a  Tawurgan  or
        they might not be believed if they said they were  not.   Tawurgans
        have been distributed through  large  areas  of  Tripoli,  and  the
        Mashashihans also, but they are not being  hunted  down.  They  are
        not, however, able to go back to their home area.

    57. Mashashihans are not Black Libyans. It  is  not  possible  to  tell
        someone from Tawurga simply by their appearance.

    58. It is common to see  black  people  on  the  streets  of  Benghazi,
        Misrata and Tripoli going about their business in an ordinary  way.
        He would say that he would now revise  his  report  to  state  that
        foreign mercenaries were certainly involved with the Qadhafi forces
        but to state that his forces 'largely comprised'  such  forces  was
        probably an overstatement. He would now say they 'included' foreign
        mercenaries.

    59. As a result, a lot of foreign workers left but it is true that Sub-
        Saharan workers are returning although the numbers are not known. A
        number are also on their way to Europe. A lot are coming  back.  As
        to whether that is an indication that the risk to them is not  what
        it was, it may be that they fail to understand the risks that  they
        face. Dr George agreed that it is not correct now to say that Black
        Libyans  would  be  perceived  as  mercenaries.  It  would  be   an
        overstatement to say that such individuals would be  likely  to  be
        perceived as ex-fighters for Qadhafi. There remains an  element  of
        racism and the majority may not have a particularly good  time.  It
        would also be an overstatement to say that there is a risk of being
        detained and of suffering serious  harm  simply  on  the  basis  of
        ethnicity. However, it is a question of degree; there  is  still  a
        risk. He would not call the risk serious, severe or real but it  is
        still a risk; a potential risk, for example when confronted by  the
        18 year old with a Kalashnikov.

    60. It is the case that it is easier to move and settle in Tripoli  and
        Benghazi than in a village. It is also true that not  every  Libyan
        has a tribal affiliation and a person may downplay it  even  if  he
        does. There is a spectrum whereby at one extreme a  person  depends
        on networks or contacts and at the other a person who is more self-
        sufficient. The general picture is that people rely on networks and
        contacts. To live away from family is unusual.

    61. In answer to our questions he said that indiscriminate violence  by
        definition affects everybody, whether or not they are  Libyan.  The
        very fact that he was able to drive to Misrata, tour  the  country,
        have coffee, speak to people in parts of  Tripoli  and  the  Nafusa
        Mountains without feeling fear or experiencing violence,  obviously
        made an impression on him.

    62. As regards  Benghazi,  he  would  still  not  regard  the  risk  of
        indiscriminate violence as being severe but would be  looking  over
        his shoulder more than in Misrata. Benghazi cannot be  compared  to
        Beirut in the mid 80's, Baghdad in 2006-2007 or Mogadishu for  many
        years, where life was anything but normal. A large portion  of  the
        population is going about business as normal in Benghazi.

    63. As regards risk as a failed asylum seeker, having been  in  the  UK
        for two or three years, there would be  no  real  risk.  Very  many
        Libyans have been living in exile. The phenomenon of Libyans living
        outside the country for many years is nothing very special. Such  a
        person would not stick out like a sore thumb.

    64. Re-examined by Mr Ficklin he said that as to the events in  Tripoli
        in  recent  days  whereby  40  demonstrators  were  wounded,   such
        eruptions can arise and then die down. After a gun battle he  would
        not hesitate (to go out) a few days later if things had died  down.
        He would check to satisfy himself as to the situation. It would  be
        sensible to make enquiries or to have someone with  him  who  knows
        the area. He would hesitate to do research  in  Tripoli  without  a
        driver, not because of fear of attack but to allay suspicion and so
        that his objective could be achieved more easily.

    65. There are ongoing detentions but they are diminishing since the end
        of the civil war. Detentions could and do occur at time of attempts
        to quell violence. There are two categories of people if stopped by
        a militia that are likely to attract more  adverse  attention  than
        others.  These  are  Tawurgans  and  the  Mashashiya,  albeit   for
        different reasons. The general position is that there are not  that
        many categories of person in that position. The fact of being  from
        Tripoli or Benghazi would not put a person at risk. If for  example
        a person is from Abu Salim district they might be regarded as  pro-
        Qadhafi.

    66. If for example,  it  is  not  known  that  a  person  is  from  the
        Mashashiya they would not  be  at  risk.  The  same  goes  for  the
        residents of Tawurga as it would not be known that they  were  from
        there. Such a person could be just  another  Black  Libyan.  It  is
        common sense that someone from Tawurga is not going to reveal  that
        fact at a Misrata  checkpoint,  or  a  Mashashiyan  in  the  Nafusa
        Mountains.

    67. Members of the Misrata militia are in Tripoli and so if someone  is
        from Tawurga they would have a problem. If a person  from  the  Abu
        Salim district of Tripoli was to encounter  a  particularly  ardent
        anti-Qadhafi militiaman then such a person could have a problem.

   Dr Geoff Porter

    68. Dr Porter is  the  founder  and  president  of  North  Africa  Risk
        Consulting which is a consulting firm specialising in country  risk
        assessments for private sector companies.  Dr  Porter  is  also  an
        instructor with the Combating Terrorism Center at the  US  Military
        Academy at West Point's  practitioner  education  program.  His  CV
        states that he instructs law enforcement agencies and  intelligence
        agencies on terrorism and security issues in North Africa  and  the
        Sahara.  That short summary of his CV is  sufficient  to  establish
        his expertise in relation to the issues to be determined  in  these
        appeals.

    69. He has provided reports dated 7 August 2012 and 14 October 2013. He
        also gave a report in response to the written questions sent by the
        Secretary of State to all the experts.

    70. His first report deals with events leading up to the  overthrow  of
        Colonel Qadhafi and the immediate aftermath, as well as  a  variety
        of matters that are also contained in the more  recent  report.  He
        visited Libya in August 2013, therefore after the first report  was
        written. In the circumstances, a summary of  the  later  report  is
        sufficient.

    71. After the overthrow of Colonel Qadhafi  nationwide  elections  were
        held on 7 July 2012, judged by observers from Libya, the EU, the US
        and multilateral organisations to be free and fair. There  were  no
        widespread allegations of fraud, negligible accusations of  polling
        station irregularities and almost no election day  violence.  Since
        2012 different  municipalities  have  staged  elections  for  local
        councils. These elections have not received so  much  attention  as
        the national elections and there were no election monitors so it is
        difficult, Dr Porter states, to  gauge  how  free  and  fair  those
        elections were.  However,  the  municipal  councils  have  received
        widespread support and are seen as legitimate  elected  bodies  for
        pursuing local interests. Tripoli has yet to hold elections  for  a
        municipal council but the local Tripoli  electoral  commission  has
        reiterated its intention to do so.

    72. At paragraph 13 Dr Porter states that an overall assessment of  the
        political landscape indicates conclusively that Libya's revolution-
        cum-civil war is over. There is no question about  the  possibility
        of renewed widespread violence between  supporters  of  the  ousted
        Qadhafi regime and revolutionaries.

    73. However, it is the case that the Libyan government does not have an
        effective   professional   army.   Police   forces   are   severely
        understaffed and there  is  no  meaningful  independent  judiciary.
        Security issues have affected the ability of the  General  National
        Congress  ("GNC")  to  perform  its   political   and   legislative
        functions.

    74. The security sector of the government continues to be uncertain and
        poorly managed, the heart of the problem being the lack of a  clear
        chain of command. The August 2011  Constitutional  Declaration  did
        not clarify to whom the Army Chief of Staff would  report  and  did
        not clarify relations between the Ministry of Interior and Ministry
        of Defence and the forces under their commands. The  newly  created
        presidential guards remain outside the control of the Army Chief of
        Staff and the Ministers of Defence and Interior.

    75. Compounding the problem is a lack of political will to confront the
        numerous militias that are the source of Libya's security  problems
        who have the backing of large and politically  potent  segments  of
        the population. Militias have been  recruited  wholesale  into  the
        state's national security structure, raising questions about  their
        reliability and allegiances.

    76. Operation Tripoli, launched in March 2013,  was  intended  to  oust
        militias from government buildings in Tripoli and  undermine  their
        capabilities. It was to be  followed  by  operation  Benghazi.  The
        former had some successes but faltered after several  weeks.  There
        is  very  little  likelihood  that  Operation  Benghazi   will   be
        initiated.

    77. Section IV of Dr  Porter's  latest  report  is  headed  "Levels  of
        violence in Tripoli" with a sub-heading "A taxonomy of violence  in
        Libya". He  refers  to  occasional  confrontations  throughout  the
        country between different ethnic groups or  groups  from  different
        regions, especially around the town of Bani  Walid  and  the  south
        eastern  city  of  Kufra.  He  states   that   in   general   these
        confrontations are not political in nature. Instead they arise from
        inter-parties grudges, revenge for long-standing disputes or  vying
        for control of the flourishing informal economy. These disputes are
        specific to the regions in which they occur and are not  instigated
        by perceptions of allegiance or opposition to the Qadhafi regime.

    78.  The  report  describes  a  second  category  of  violence,   being
        politically motivated violence in both Tripoli and Benghazi. Groups
        that feel that the GNC is  insufficiently  addressing  issues  have
        taken  important  installations,  institutions  or   infrastructure
        "hostage" as leverage. The violence is  politically  motivated  but
        the goal is not violence in and of  itself.  The  violence  quickly
        dissipates within days  if  not  hours.  Although  casualties  have
        resulted, the victims are not  the  targets  of  the  violence  and
        individuals are not singled out.

    79. Under the heading Islamist violence he  describes  "Salafi  Jihadi"
        violence that is driven  by  hostility  towards  the  West.  Salafi
        Jihadi violence  had  only  targeted  individuals  or  institutions
        linked to foreign governments or to former high level  officers  in
        Qadhafi's intelligence services.  He  refers  to  three  particular
        examples and states that none of them resulted  in  any  casualties
        and the attacks were extremely rudimentary. Such violence reached a
        peak in September 2012 with the assault on the US Consular  Mission
        in Benghazi.

    80. When considering "Militia  profile"  the  report  states  that  the
        militias use their weapons as  deterrents  rather  than  as  actual
        means of coercion. They also  serve  as  irregular  police  forces,
        safeguarding  neighbourhoods,  establishing  night  time   patrols,
        directing traffic and generally trying to  ensure  law  and  order.
        Important  installations,  key  traffic  intersections   and   some
        government buildings are guarded by armed, uniformed  men  who  are
        not members of official law enforcement or the military.

    81. Some of the larger militias such as those from Zintan  and  Misrata
        have been enlisted by the government to function as proxies  for  a
        national security force.  The  National  Transitional  Council  has
        allowed and sometimes encouraged those two militias  to  assist  in
        peacekeeping operations around the country. Each can deploy quickly
        throughout the country, both having fixed wing and rotary  aircraft
        as well as armoured personnel carriers, tanks  and  tank  transport
        vehicles. Each has several thousand members.

    82. Whilst the militias operate outside or above the law  they  do  not
        behave  in  an  undisciplined  manner  "and  exhibit  sophisticated
        command and control". The leadership is known  to  the  public  and
        there are clear hierarchies. Local militias have clearly demarcated
        territories. Some militias are in the pay of different  ministries,
        for example oilfield security or airport security.

    83. On the other hand he states that  this  is  not  to  say  that  the
        militias do not carry out their own interpretation of justice.  The
        vast majority of detainees in  the  country  (5,000-6,000)  are  in
        militia custody. Those individuals have been  detained  because  of
        past affiliation with the regime, family  grievances  or  feuds  or
        simply because of personal insults.

    84. Regarding sufficiency of protection, there is no effective policing
        capability by uniformed officers under the authority of national or
        municipal institutions. Faced with the  overwhelming  firepower  of
        militias and the  widespread  availability  of  weapons  among  the
        general population the official police cannot guarantee  protection
        for individuals, nor can they provide recourse for individuals  who
        have encountered problems. To  secure  protection  individuals  can
        turn to militia  leadership  and  declare  their  support  for  the
        militia.

    85. There is the danger that in travelling throughout  the  country  an
        individual who is not from a given territory will be detained by  a
        militia. In the vast majority  of  instances  average  Libyans  are
        allowed to pass safely through militia held territories  but  there
        remains the possibility that an individual  will  be  detained  for
        unexplained reasons.

    86. Militias often  set  up  checkpoints  after  dark  to  monitor  the
        movement of individuals. Day time  checkpoints  are  rare  although
        they do appear on intercity roads and occasionally on the periphery
        of some of the large towns and cities.

    87.  Tripoli  has  become  largely  a  safe  city.  There   have   been
        intermittent bouts of political violence  but  these  have  largely
        been driven by grievances that the militias argue that the  GNC  is
        not sufficiently addressing. There have been  revenge  killings  in
        the city and  former  members  of  the  Qadhafi  regime  have  been
        persecuted. Some former members of  the  regime  still  occupy  key
        posts in the government.

    88. Since July 2012 there has been an increase  in  violent  crime  and
        reports  of   criminally   motivated   murders   and   carjackings.
        Kidnapping, murder, rape and other violent crime is also increasing
        in Tripoli and elsewhere.

    89. In relation to Benghazi, security there is decidedly worse than  in
        Tripoli. It has also witnessed a series  of  politically  motivated
        murders of former Qadhafi officials who worked in the  intelligence
        services. There have been more than three  dozen  such  murders  in
        2013. There has similarly been  a  dramatic  increase  in  criminal
        violence.

    90. The report states that security between cities is questionable  and
        Dr Porter states  that  it  is  recommended  that  individuals  fly
        between  cities  wherever  possible.  Two  examples  from  personal
        observations are given. Nevertheless, he states that road travel in
        2013 has  improved  and  it  is  now  feasible  to  travel  by  car
        throughout most of the country. Driving from Tripoli to Benghazi or
        Sabha is prohibitively long  but  feasible.  The  fundamental  risk
        while travelling  on  roads  out  of  Tripoli  is  the  uncertainty
        regarding road  conditions,  the  possibility  of  harassment  from
        militias and general banditry. The risk of  any  of  these  is  not
        exceptionally high  but  the  lack  of  recourse  to  any  national
        security service or emergency help amplifies the risk.

    91. Checkpoints exist on all major roads out of  Tripoli,  as  well  as
        between cities and at the entry points to towns and  cities.  There
        is an acute desire to know who is travelling, from  and  to  where,
        and why. There is a  lingering  anxiety  over  a  possible  counter
        revolution and a desire to  protect  informal  economic  activities
        from government oversight or encroachment by other groups. They are
        also used to find  individuals  with  whom  the  operators  have  a
        regional, ethnic, tribal or family grievance. Some  are  manned  by
        police and others by militia.

    92. If someone is demonstrably pro-Qadhafi he is unlikely to be able to
        transit a checkpoint  safely.  The  same  applies  in  relation  to
        someone from the Tawurga tribe. Racism runs deep in Libya.

    93. The procedures at  checkpoints  are  often  ad  hoc.  Depending  on
        answers to questions there may be a demand for other documents such
        as a  national  ID  card  or  identification  associated  with  the
        government, a ministry, a  state-owned  enterprise  or  a  militia.
        Increasingly foreigners are asked to provide a  passport  to  prove
        nationality. Because there is no set protocol at checkpoints  there
        is correspondingly no set way of avoiding difficulties.

    94. Tripoli and Benina (in Benghazi) airports are  for  the  most  part
        safe and secure and there is little immediate  danger  flying  into
        these airports or transiting them. Airport security is reliable and
        safe well into the night, with passengers coming  and  going  after
        midnight and into the dawn hours.

    95. Tripoli airport is the main entry point for flights from Europe. It
        is served by numerous  international  carriers,  including  British
        Airways, Alitalia, Air France and Lufthansa. Since the end  of  the
        conflict flights operate with a  reasonable  degree  of  regularity
        although unexplained  cancellations  or  delays  frequently  occur.
        There are direct  flights  from  Heathrow  several  times  a  week.
        Tripoli  airport   is   currently   controlled   by   the   Tripoli
        International Airport Authority. Airport staff are employees of the
        airport authority and security is  provided  by  airport  authority
        employees. Until May 2012  security  was  provided  by  the  Zintan
        militia. In reality it appears that airport security has been taken
        over by members of the Misrata militia who are now wearing official
        airport security uniforms and are on the  payroll  of  the  airport
        authority.

    96. Airport security mans  checkpoints  on  airport  access  roads  and
        around  the  perimeter  of  the  airfield.  There   are   screening
        checkpoints at the entrance to the airport.  Screening  checkpoints
        are rudimentary, and often staffed by  untrained  personnel.  There
        are still unidentified militia members at the airport in some  kind
        of official capacity. There are no weapons apart from those carried
        by security officials.

    97. There is reference to a security  incident  in  June  2012  when  a
        militia group from  Tarhouna  seized  control  of  the  airport  in
        retaliation for the detention of their  leader  by  an  undisclosed
        group in Tripoli. Some planes were damaged but no  passengers  were
        hurt.  The Zintan brigade retaliated but  eventually  the  Tarhouna
        militia withdrew. There has been no  major  security  breach  since
        then.

    98. Benghazi International airport is a secondary point of entry to the
        country, largely serving as a domestic airport. There are no direct
        flights from the UK although transfer directly from Tripoli airport
        is possible. The airport authority provides security. For the  most
        part it is free of security concerns.

    99. Mitiga airport no longer services inbound flights from Europe apart
        from   in   exceptional   circumstances.   It   services   regional
        international carriers to destinations such as  Egypt,  Jordan  and
        Syria.

   100. Customs and border  patrol  officers  control  entry  and  exit  at
        international border crossings  at  the  airports  of  Tripoli  and
        Benghazi. Questions posed to Libyans returning from abroad  include
        reasons for travel and length  of  stay  abroad,  and  reasons  for
        return.  The  officials  do  not  generally  ask  questions   about
        political affiliation or participating in the revolution.

   101. Occasionally individuals  are  singled  out  for  interrogation  on
        return. Return without a  Libyan  passport  would  be  grounds  for
        further questioning, as would travel to sub-Saharan Africa  and  to
        the Sahara states in particular. Dr Porter states that  Libya  does
        not recognise dual citizenship.

   102. Travel to European  countries  and  to  the  US  does  not  provoke
        suspicion. There may be  animosity  to  those  who  "sat  out"  the
        revolution in Europe or the US, but this has not been a  basis  for
        persecution. There have been no  reported  instances  of  returnees
        being detained by airport authorities or militias  on  leaving  the
        airport.

   103. Benghazi residents, who have  different  accents  from  those  from
        Tripoli,  travel  freely  throughout  the  country,  including   in
        Tripoli. Some Libyans from Benghazi live in Tripoli unmolested.

   104. At para 63 Dr Porter states that individuals  who  worked  for  the
        Qadhafi regime's intelligence services are exposed to unique  risk.
        There have been numerous instances of assassinations, those  people
        having apparently been on a hit list of 109 names. The risk applies
        even to  those  who  left  the  intelligence  services  during  the
        revolution and sided with the rebels. The assassinations  have  the
        hallmarks of  being  well  planned  and  deliberate,  but  with  no
        "collateral damage" or other casualties.

   105. Souq Al-Juma'a in Tripoli (where AT is from) has its  own  militia.
        It is likely that AT would be able to come  to  some  accommodation
        with the militia to secure his safety.  He is  also  likely  to  be
        able to relocate without his Souq Al-Juma'a origins being  revealed
        or jeopardising his safety.

   106. In relation to AT's lack of tribal affiliation, there are many  who
        are not  associated  with  tribes  or  who  downplay  their  tribal
        affiliation, especially in Tripoli and Benghazi where it has become
        less important than neighbourhood  ties  or  social  class.  It  is
        entirely possible for someone to relocate to another part of  Libya
        without negative impact in relation to tribal issues.

   107. In commenting on the risk to AT in terms  of  his  claim  that  his
        father worked for the intelligence services  under  Qadhafi  (which
        has not been found to be credible by the  First-tier  Tribunal)  Dr
        Porter states that Libya is very interconnected and people in  even
        far flung places know of each other. Individuals closely associated
        with the Qadhafi regime "and individuals' family members" have been
        kidnapped detained and murdered because of their past  connections.
        However, that is not always the case. Seventy per  cent  of  Libyan
        labour force during the Qadhafi regime worked in the public sector,
        so that the "gross majority" of Libyans was in some way  associated
        with the regime. Association with the regime was especially high in
        Tripoli. It is not unusual for individuals to have worked for or to
        have had family members who have had  some  relationship  with  the
        previous government.

   108. It is possible for a woman  to  travel  overland  from  Tripoli  to
        Benghazi. Three domestic  airlines  offer  multiple  daily  flights
        between the two cities for approximately �64, taking less than  one
        hour. Were HKA to travel overland it is recommended that she travel
        in the company of other women or men. She would be able to hire  an
        inter city taxi or take a bus from Tripoli to Benghazi. Road travel
        could take well over 15 hours. It is not necessarily dangerous  for
        a woman to travel alone but it is unusual. A woman travelling alone
        would  be  likely  to  be  subject  to  additional  questioning  at
        checkpoints, especially since the revolution.  Libyan  society  has
        become more socially conservative.

   109. Dr Porter answered the respondent's written questions in a  further
        short report dated 5 November 2013.  He states that the ICC  report
        in relation to Abdullah Al-Senussi is evidence of the  vagaries  of
        the Libyan justice system, in particular the possibility that Libya
        would be unable to provide Al-Senussi with legal counsel. The ICC's
        decision also potentially reveals the politicisation of the justice
        system. Al-Senussi's circumstances are far from representative.  It
        is unlikely that a less well-known figure would  be  treated  in  a
        similar manner.

   110. The fact that the Court is unable to compel the captors of  the  31
        Qadhafi era officials to bring them to court is evidence that there
        is no effective judiciary. The militias largely do as they  please.
        The Zintan militia holding Saif al-Islam did not bring him  to  the
        pre-trial hearing although it had agreed to do so, and the  Tripoli
        court has no power to compel the militia to do so.

   111. The trial monitoring network is unlikely to be effective given that
        many NGO's recommendations are not implemented, because for example
        the counterparts with which the NGOs are dealing do  not  have  the
        authority to enact reforms. At other times the reforms  recommended
        do not correspond with the actual state of the institutions  to  be
        reformed.

   112. As to the progress and implementation of  the  torture,  kidnapping
        and discrimination law, like the trial monitoring  recommendations,
        this is aspirational. There is no effective  police  force  and  no
        effective  mechanism  for  monitoring  discrimination.  People  are
        regularly kidnapped without any subsequent prosecution.

   Dr Porter-oral evidence

   113. Dr Porter gave evidence by video link. In response to questions  in
        examination-in-chief from Ms Harrison he said that there  are  many
        militia that vary in size from several thousand  to  a  handful  of
        people. Through family and tribal connections a person could secure
        protection. He does not know how someone could secure protection in
        Tripoli if the person is not from that area.

   114. In relation  to  securing  protection,  the  militias  are  not  by
        definition hostile to each other. There are some  large  coalitions
        of militia, for example Libyan  Shield  and  the  Supreme  Security
        Committee. It is not impossible that someone could be  allied  with
        several militias.

   115. In  Benghazi  the  violent  incidents  and  criminal  violence  are
        entirely unpredictable, so it is  possible  that  one  could  be  a
        victim of criminal violence, or kidnapping.

   116. As regards a woman travelling in Libya, the  extent  to  which  she
        would be able to navigate through the checkpoints would  depend  on
        the purpose of the travel. An example would be if she were visiting
        family and the family member  were  a  respectable  member  of  the
        community. On the other hand if she were engaged in  commerce,  she
        may have to pay  some  form  of  bribe.  She  may  have  to  answer
        questions about her ultimate destination.

   117. He is not aware of a woman suffering ill-treatment at a checkpoint.
        Libyan society is very segregated. He travels with groups of men so
        he has no direct experience of that issue.

   118. A  single  female  with  no  links  to  the  community  would  have
        tremendous difficulty gaining access to accommodation. It  is  very
        rare that Libyans travel to new  communities  without  establishing
        prior contact in terms of tribal or family connections. It is  very
        rare for a woman to arrive in a community without knowing a  single
        person in the community. It is very rare for a single woman to rent
        a hotel room by herself. The suspicion  would  be  that  she  is  a
        prostitute.

   119. As to who controls Benghazi airport, he does not know but it  could
        be Ansar Sharia or Libya Shield. Few westerners have  travelled  to
        Benghazi in the last several months because the security  situation
        is so precarious.

   120. He is not aware of any incidents at Benghazi  airport  since  2012,
        although local  newspapers  would  have  reports  of  incidents  in
        relation to insecurity at the airport.

   121. The citizenship law has not been updated; there is no  constitution
        in Libya.

   122. In response to questions from Mr Ficklin he said that as  of  today
        the Misrata militia had ostensibly withdrawn from the airport  over
        the weekend. There  had  been  a  confrontation  between  them  and
        demonstrators.  Up  to  last  Thursday  the  Misrata  militia  were
        providing airport security. Many members of the customs and  border
        control are from the Misrata militia. It is  the  ministry  of  the
        interior that is in charge of  the  airport  not  the  ministry  of
        foreign affairs.  He does not know  whether  the  ministry  of  the
        interior  dictates  to  the  customs  and  border  officials   what
        questions to ask.

   123. The events in relation to the Misrata brigade last Friday did  take
        place partially in the  neighbourhood  of  Souq  Al-Juma'a.  As  to
        whether AT, having ID from that area, puts him at risk in terms  of
        contact with the Misrata militia, the  answer  is  yes.  Passengers
        arriving are required to fill out a disembarkation form with  their
        name, date of birth, nationality and local address. If  he  arrived
        at Tripoli airport and were to hand it to the  customs  and  border
        officials from the Misrata militia, this would create  a  potential
        risk. If the Misrata militia left Tripoli that does not  mean  that
        they would not be replaced by other militia.

   124. In terms of whether the policing function of the militias  conforms
        to a standard policing framework of  investigation  followed  by  a
        court appearance, his understanding is  that  they  undertake  that
        function in a completely arbitrary way. When he  was  in  Libya  in
        August his Libyan friend complained that they would detain a person
        and they would disappear, and  he  says  that  now  there  are  100
        Qadhafis.

   125. It is speculative to suggest why those detentions take place.  They
        could be for any one of a number of reasons or  for  none  at  all;
        because  of  the  way  a  person  looked  at  the  militia  person,
        disrespected him, because of suspected association with the Qadhafi
        regime, or because of involvement in commerce that is the militia's
        area of commerce. It could also relate to accusation  of  (various)
        crimes.

   126. There is an increasing sense of impunity  and  popular  frustration
        with the lack of policing  progress.  Violent  crime  has  remained
        constant since July 2012.

   127. In cross-examination he said that there are numerous  instances  of
        violence between ethnic tribes. There have been allegations against
        the Tawurgans that they were allied with the Qadhafi forces.  There
        have been prosecutions of the Tawurga.  The  Misrata  militia  took
        revenge against the inhabitants of  Tawurga  which  was  in  effect
        'cleansed'. The former inhabitants are either in detention or  have
        spread around Libya. That is a good example of an area perceived as
        a whole to have been allied with Qadhafi.

   128. There are other conflicts that are long-standing and  pre-date  the
        revolution against the Qadhafi regime. Those conflicts are specific
        to the region in which they occur.

   129. As regards politically  motivated  violence,  this  has  become  an
        aspect of political culture in Libya. It is a way of  amplifying  a
        grievance and calling attention to things that have been ignored by
        the government. The kidnapping of the Prime Minister had  political
        overtones. He was not tortured or beaten. His glasses were  broken.
        He went to an ophthalmologist and was back at his desk by 10 am.

   130. As to Islamist violence, there have been other attacks since  those
        noted in his report. Jihadis also harbour a grudge against  Muslims
        perceived to be insufficiently Muslim.

   131. Other violent incidents involve foreign governments or former  high
        level intelligence officials, ordinary criminal violence  and  that
        involving the peaceful demonstrators in Tripoli  the  weekend  just
        gone. Aside from those categories, he does not believe  that  there
        is a prospect of a counter revolution.

   132. Dr Porter agreed that there is no indiscriminate violence targeting
        individuals, for example in terms of  bombs  in  market  places  or
        snipers. There has not been the indiscriminate use of violence as a
        political tool. The opinion in Libya is that it  is  Jihadi  groups
        that were responsible for the assassinations of former intelligence
        officers mentioned at para 63 of his report.

   133. In relation to  those  sorts  of  attack,  he  was  speaking  to  a
        colleague last week in relation to a 'sticky bomb' killing a former
        member  of  the  intelligence  service  and  there  were  no  other
        casualties. It was specifically intended to kill the driver but the
        bomb was no bigger than necessary for that purpose.

   134. In relation to family members of former intelligence officers,  the
        only evidence that he had seen is collateral damage. There  do  not
        appear to be any intended targets. Having said that,  the  daughter
        of Al-Senussi, Chief of Intelligence, was kidnapped in August 2013.
        She was released but not until the water supply to Tripoli was  cut
        off until she was released. This was in  August  2013.  He  is  not
        aware of any other incidents involving family members.

   135. There are no difficulties specific to women in relation  to  flying
        from Tripoli to Benghazi apart from the usual difficulties with air
        travel  in  Libya  because  of  delayed  or  cancelled  flights  or
        uncertain equipment.

   136. If a woman was travelling with her brother that would overcome  the
        complications of  a  lone  woman  being  asked  more  questions  if
        travelling by bus or taxi from Tripoli to Benghazi.

   137. It is very hard to believe that an individual (from Benghazi) would
        have no point of contact in the capital given the intimacy and  the
        small size of Libyan society.

   138. Up to last Thursday Tripoli airport has been a calm and safe  place
        apart from a brief period when it was occupied for a short time.

   139. He does not know the percentage of Black Libyans in the country. It
        may be a difficult statistic to devise  because  an  individual  in
        Libya could have characteristics that are considered  to  be  black
        outside Libya but not within Libya and vice versa.  Many  of  those
        considered Black Libyans are working in unskilled trades  but  they
        are seen moving about in Libya. It is  impossible  to  say  without
        talking to someone if  they  are  a  Black  Libyan  or  an  illegal
        immigrant from Sub-Saharan Africa.

   140. There is a perception that they fought for Qadhafi. On the one hand
        there is an element of politically  motivated  racial  persecution.
        Libyan society is blatantly racist. He is not able to answer as  to
        whether black Africans are being detained on the basis of suspicion
        of being mercenary fighters. He  was  not  able  to  answer  as  to
        whether there is (in legal terms) only  discrimination  or  whether
        there  is  persecution  against  Black  Libyans   and   Sub-Saharan
        Africans. He thinks  there  is  still  a  belief  that  Sub-Saharan
        Africans who remained in Libya may be the  remains  of  mercenaries
        who fought in Qadhafi's army.

   141. Souq Al-Juma'a (where AT is from) is a large suburb of Tripoli  and
        has its own militia. The areas of urban topography however blend in
        to one another. Up until the events of the last  weekend  he  would
        not have said that coming from Souq Al-Juma'a would  put  a  person
        arriving at Tripoli airport at risk. There could be  recriminations
        from the Misrata brigade against those from Souq Al-Juma'a who  had
        attacked them.

   142. He agreed however, that someone who had been in the UK for the last
        three years would not be seen as someone who had this last  weekend
        attacked the Misrata brigade. Someone  from  Souq  Al-Juma'a  going
        through the airport at Tripoli would  not  be  more  at  risk  than
        someone living in Souq Al-Juma'a at present. He accepted  that  his
        assessment of risk was entirely speculative in that it is too early
        to make a judgement about people being subjected  to  harm  on  the
        basis of where they are from.

   143. In relation to checkpoints, cars could be stopped and  searched  on
        the basis that it is weapons that  are  being  sought  or  anything
        deemed incriminating, alternatively simply as a  justification  for
        detention. It could also be a search for drugs,  alcohol  or  other
        contraband items, or merely for a bribe.

   144. There was a report from Human Rights  Watch  which  documented  the
        detention of Tawurgans by different militia  throughout  Libya.  He
        does not have knowledge of such incidents beyond what  is  in  that
        report.

   145. He does not have information that today individuals are captured or
        detained because of past affiliation with the Qadhafi regime.

   146. In order to be able to say what is the scale in the last few months
        of detentions for random or unpredictable reasons, one  would  have
        to have statistics on the whole range of people  detained  and  for
        what reasons.

   147. The variation in estimates in relation  to  the  number  of  people
        detained is 40 per cent; from 5,000 to 8,000 people.  There  is  no
        indication as to whether those detained are  the  same  5-8,000  or
        whether that is the number "cycling though" detention. There are no
        reliable statistics. Therefore there is no statistical  information
        on the likelihood of detention.

   148. When he was  recently  in  Libya  there  were  many  other  Libyans
        driving. Traffic is a problem as there  is  a  lot  of  traffic  on
        Libyan roads going through the  checkpoints.  He  agreed  with  the
        suggestion that to an extent the risk of detention is not  such  as
        to deter those people going through the checkpoints.

   149. Re-examined by Mr Ficklin he was asked whether the risk to  him  in
        travelling through the checkpoints was greater or less than for the
        average Libyan. He said that there are a lot of  different  factors
        that go to assessing an individual's profile. He does not  know  if
        he was at greater or lesser risk. It may have been less as  he  has
        no ties to Libyan society. Another view is that it could have  been
        greater. He  is  from  a  non-Muslim  country  that  supported  the
        campaign to overthrow Qadhafi.

   150. If a person was not able to pay a bribe at a checkpoint he suspects
        that such a person would be detained. If a person were to say at  a
        checkpoint that they were a supporter of  Qadhafi  he  agreed  that
        there is a serious risk that such a person would be detained.

   151. If a person said that they were from Tawurga, it  would  depend  on
        the militia manning the checkpoint as  to  whether  they  would  be
        detained. One would not  know  what  particular  militia  is  at  a
        checkpoint until one arrives there. Not all checkpoints  carry  the
        same risk. He and his colleague passed  through  five  checkpoints,
        and his colleague said that he did not know  who  was  manning  the
        checkpoints as they were never stopped.

   152. There would be an increased risk to a person who was known to be  a
        family member of a person who  worked  for  Qadhafi's  intelligence
        services.

   153. As to risk to a family member of a person from a different militia,
        it would depend on the militia. Not all are hostile to each  other;
        some are allied to each other.   Some  areas  are  associated  with
        particular militias.

   154. In answer to our  questions  he  said  that  he  is  aware  of  the
        procedures at Tripoli airport because that is where he arrived  and
        as far as he knows everyone has to undergo the same process.

   155. As to the risk of indiscriminate violence on the streets  of  Libya
        for someone going back, the risk is relatively low. It could happen
        but the likelihood is about 5 per cent, certainly less than  a  one
        in ten chance.

   156. In further cross-examination  he  said  that  there  is  a  lot  of
        violence in Libyan society and there is  no  formal  check  on  the
        violence. Some can be described as  indiscriminate  but  not  on  a
        wholesale terrorist scale. He was not saying that five per cent, or
        one in twenty Libyans are suffering the affects of violence,  which
        would be awfully high.  This is in the realm of speculation and (an
        assessment) would benefit from a statistical review which  he  does
        not have.

   Professor Emile Joff�

   157. Professor Joff� provided a  total  of  7  reports  in  relation  to
        appellants AMH and HKA. They are dated, 19 August 2011, 1 September
        2011, 21 March 2012, 15 August 2012, 12 September 2013,  4  October
        2013, and 31 October 2013 in response to the  respondent's  written
        questions.  In  so  far  as  necessary,  we   summarise   them   in
        chronological order.

   158. The reports of 19 August 2011 in relation to AMH  and  1  September
        2011  in  relation  to  HKA  respectively,  are  useful  background
        information but given the date on which they  were  written,  at  a
        time when Libya was in a state of civil war, do not give an  up-to-
        date assessment  of  the  situation  in  Libya  relevant  to  these
        appellants, whose claims were based, to a greater or lesser extent,
        on their anti-Qadhafi activities. In the case of AMH the report pre-
        dates the hearing before the First-tier  Tribunal  and  necessarily
        does  not  take  account  of  the  findings  in  relation  to  past
        persecution.

   159. The report of 19 August 2011 deals in part with the potential  risk
        from the Qadhafi regime on account of his having taken part in anti-
        regime protests and on account of his being black. He describes the
        appellant as being a member of the Bla'za "tribe" being  the  major
        tribal group in the town of Zawiye. Other groups mentioned  by  AMH
        are often collectively known as  the  Zawiye,  since  as  an  urban
        population  precise  tribal  affiliation  has  tended  to  be  less
        significant. AMH is a member of the H sub-clan of the  Bla'za.  The
        appellant's family being  black,  they  are  unlike  the  generally
        Caucasoid population of coastal Libya. His historical  origins  are
        almost certainly African and his ancestors may have been manumitted
        slaves who adopted the tribal identities of their  former  masters.
        Such persons are now accepted as full tribal members despite  their
        different ethnic origins and the acute racial tensions  in  coastal
        Libya.

   160. Professor Joff� describes the legacy of uncontrolled migration from
        sub-Saharan Africa as one of bitter hatred of black Africans, there
        having been riots targeting black  populations  on  the  assumption
        that they were of sub-Saharan African origin. The risk  to  AMH  in
        terms of his ethnicity is not  on  account  of  his  tribe  but  on
        account of his being black.

   161. There is a description of  the  concept  and  introduction  of  the
        notion of collective family and tribal  responsibility  during  the
        Qadhafi regime. Some groups or tribes linked to the Qadhafi  regime
        enjoyed  significant  privileges.  These  included  the   Qadhadhfa
        (Qadhafi's own tribe), the Maghraha from the region of Misurata and
        the  Warfalla.  These  tribes  had   penetrated   deep   into   the
        administrative and the  security  services  as  well  as  the  army
        command.

   162. In relation to HKA, the report of 1  September  2011  explains  the
        issue of Libyan nationality and dual citizenship as of the date  of
        the report, with reference to the suggestion that she  is  entitled
        to Egyptian citizenship. Thereafter the report is identical to that
        of 18 August 2011, with the exception of the concluding  paragraphs
        which deal specifically with HKA's case based on  her  anti-Qadhafi
        activities and the security situation at that time.

   163. Professor Joff�'s report of 21 March 2012 can be  described  as  an
        interim report in  the  sense  that  it  post-dates  the  rebellion
        against the Qadhafi regime  and  describes  the  situation  in  the
        country at that time. At para 28, citing a report in  the  Guardian
        of 21 October 2011, he refers to militias  having  rounded  up  and
        imprisoned suspected "collaborators" from  the  former  regime.  He
        states that up  to  7,000  persons  are  believed  to  be  held  in
        makeshift prisons as a result.

   164. At para 30 it states that the Misrata militia have  forced  out  of
        Tawurga the black population there, setting fire to their houses to
        ensure that they do not return.  The  ostensible  reason  for  that
        action is, he states, that Tawurgans  were  regime  supporters  but
        given  the  racial  tensions  that  are   widespread   in   coastal
        Tripolitania, one of the three provinces of  Libya,  other  factors
        have certainly played a part.

   165. At para 31 he refers to a temporary occupation of  Tripoli  airport
        by the Souq Al-Juma'a brigade in relation to an  incident  in  Bani
        Walid when several of their members died. The occupation upset  the
        Zintan brigades that controlled the airport. In early December 2011
        there were clashes between militias inside Tripoli which led  to  a
        demand by the provisional government to demand that all non-Tripoli
        based militias leave the capital by 20 December, a demand that  was
        not met. There is reference to a local protest against  the  Zawiye
        militia in Bani Walid in January 2012. Para  33  describes  serious
        clashes between two tribes  at  al-Kufrah  in  south-eastern  Libya
        between the Arab Zawi tribe and the  Tebu  tribe  from  Chad.  Such
        events had also happened under the Qadhafi regime.

   166. The 15 August 2012 report in relation to AMH states at para 36 that
        those rounded up as suspected collaborators and still detained  had
        reduced to 5,000.

   167. The 21 March 2012 report states that remnants of the 32nd  Brigade,
        the shock troops of the former  regime,  accused  of  most  of  the
        atrocities that took place during the civil war, had  reformed  and
        were committing further abuses. The 15 August 2012 report adds that
        those individuals are often Tuareg.

   168. The risk to AMH is, as previously described, much to  do  with  his
        assumed ethnicity, the report referring to the racism in  Libya  in
        particular in the coastal area and the recruitment  by  the  former
        regime of sub-Saharan Africans and Tuareg into its special forces.

   169. The reports of 12 September 2013 and 4 October 2013  bring  matters
        up to date. The first, prepared in relation to HKA, refers  to  the
        political  situation.  In  relation  to  security,  it  refers   to
        worsening violence in Tripoli and Benghazi, with security  problems
        also in Kufrah,  Jabal  Nafusa,  Zintan  and  Sabha.  A  number  of
        incidents are referred to.

   170. The Misrata  militia  persisted  in  excluding  the  population  of
        Tawurga because it  was  alleged  to  have  supported  the  Qadhafi
        regime. The Zuwara militia victimised the Warshafanna tribe for the
        same reason and likewise the Zintan  militia  in  relation  to  the
        Mashashiya.

   171. At para 20 Professor Joff� refers to the  emergence  of  a  shadowy
        network of salafi-jihadi militias under the generic title of  Ansar
        al-Shari'a, which he states has nothing  to  do  with  Libya's  own
        jihadists of the 1990's which was focused on destroying the Qadhafi
        regime. At para 21 it states that the  movement  is  widely  spread
        throughout Libya and has been implicated in attacks on Libya's Sufi
        movements.

   172. From para 29 he refers to the worsening security situation in 2013,
        including in terms of a string of assassinations  of  intelligence,
        police and military officers accused of  having  served  under  the
        Qadhafi regime.

   173. Under the heading "Economy and Society" it is stated that it  might
        be premature to argue that  Libya  is  becoming  a  failing  state.
        Libyans themselves are  increasingly  frustrated  by  the  security
        crisis and pressure is mounting on the militias to accommodate  the
        new realities. The salafi-jihadi movements also face a growing tide
        of popular mistrust.

   174. Day-to-day life for the majority of Libyans continued  without  too
        much disruption  once  the  oil  industry  had  been  revived.  Oil
        production had been back to the pre-war level and Libya had  gained
        control of all the assets frozen in 2011. Seventy-eight per cent of
        the population lives in the urban conurbations around  Tripoli  and
        Benghazi but distribution (of food and  consumer  goods)  has  been
        maintained to the more isolated communities of the interior despite
        the precarious security situation there.

   175. Nevertheless, there are serious problems in that oilfield  and  oil
        protection force workers, dissatisfied with their remuneration, had
        shut down the oil export port of Zuetina on three occasions. Action
        by Cyrenaican separatists impeded oil production  and  export.  The
        result was a decline in oil exports by 50 per cent in  August  2013
        and had further fallen by September 2013.

   176. However, Libyans are acutely aware of what they  achieved  in  2011
        and there is a very strong feeling that they are  not  prepared  to
        see  those  gains  lost  through  fragmentation  and   chaos.   The
        government is aware of the problems in relation to  minorities  and
        regional jealousies, and makes constant attempts to  resolve  them.
        Major managerial components of  the  oil  sector  have  moved  from
        Tripoli to Benghazi and  provincial  equality  in  the  forthcoming
        elections  for  the  constitutional  drafting  committee  has  been
        agreed.

   177. There is also a  general  determination  for  Libya  to  achieve  a
        collective future which avoids the  fragmentation  implied  in  the
        current security chaos. Even though deep social wounds persist, the
        kinds of collective vengeance seen elsewhere in such  circumstances
        has so far been avoided.

   178. Security, even at open border points is unpredictable because  they
        are still generally controlled by militia units. Tripoli airport is
        controlled by the  Zintan  militia  and  Benghazi  airport  is  the
        subject of an attempt  by  Libyan  special  forces  to  control  it
        against constant skirmishing by Takfir wa Hirja  and  salafi-jihadi
        groups.  Land border points are also open to unpredictable  clashes
        between rival militias although some are supposed to be  controlled
        by Libyan army special forces personnel. There is no indication  of
        how effective such control  is  or  whether  it  is  undisputed  by
        neighbouring militia units.

   179. The state is not able to provide adequate  protection  to  its  own
        nationals. Even though a few army units have been  deployed,  their
        authority is challenged  by  Libyan  Shield  forces.  There  is  no
        effective police force outside the Supreme Security Committee units
        which, like Libyan Shield, are militia  based.  Both  organisations
        are not under proper civilian control and both engage in  arbitrary
        arrest and detention.

   180. As regards relocation  inside  Libya,  Libya's  spatial  population
        distribution plays a significant role. Libyan society is peculiarly
        intimate as the population is essentially compressed  into  a  very
        small space of less that  5  per  cent  of  the  total  land  area.
        Personal security cannot be achieved through physical distance.

   181. In addition, Libya is in a state of administrative chaos such  that
        it  is  virtually  impossible  to  obtain  documentation  from  the
        municipal or national authorities. Duplicates of  the  family  book
        which is an essential document that contains  birth,  marriage  and
        death certificates, are unobtainable. The family book  is  a  vital
        document  to  ensure  residence  and   registration   through   the
        municipality and the police, as well as  an  identity  card  and/or
        passport  which  are   vital   for   the   purposes   of   personal
        identification and without  which  all  Libyans  risk  arrest.  The
        danger  is  in  terms  of  the  militias  who   arbitrarily   check
        identification and detain those whom they consider to  lack  proper
        documentation.

   182. The southern region of Libya was declared a closed military zone on
        16 December 2012. In addition, Libyan residents are not allowed  to
        travel to the interior or border regions (except  for  the  borders
        with Tunisia or Egypt) without special permission  or  an  official
        guide, under threat of prosecution.

   183. The report concludes by stating that nowhere inside  Libya,  except
        perhaps for the centre of Tripoli, is considered  to  be  a  secure
        environment and even there there are constant violent incidents.

   184. Professor Joff�'s last report, in relation to AMH,  adds  that  the
        depth of  the  crisis  the  country  faces  should  not  be  under-
        estimated. There is still no agreement on what the form of the  new
        constitution should be. Moderate Islamists  in  the  GNC  will  not
        accept the exclusion of  Shar'ia  law  and  nationalists  will  not
        tolerate its inclusion. He refers to other political divisions  and
        potential emerging political problems. In the province of Cyrenaica
        and in Benghazi there is no effective police force and as a  result
        criminal activity has exploded. The oil sector protests are as much
        an attempt by local families to capture control of the oil trade as
        they were an attempt to improve pay and conditions.

   185. Professor Joff� states that AMH will still face the intense  racism
        that characterises Libya's coastal society. By way of example,  the
        35,000 strong black population of Tawurga was dispersed  throughout
        Libya  and  the  city  remains  empty.  The  attitude  to   Libya's
        ethnically black population is generalised throughout  the  country
        and similar tensions fuel the  conflict  at  Kufrah  and  in  Sabha
        between the Tibu and surrounding Arab populations.

   186. AMH would not be able to ensure his personal safety by  relocating.
        Tawurgans are forced to live in  shanty  towns  outside  the  major
        population centres and cannot return to their permanent homes.  The
        transient  African  population  has  fled  either  back  to   their
        countries or to Europe as a result of the hostility  shown  towards
        them by Libyans because of their  perceived  association  with  the
        Qadhafi regime.

   187.  The  generalised  degrading  security  situation  makes  life  for
        despised ethnic minorities even more difficult. The  state  is  not
        able to offer protection to its  own  nationals.  There  is  little
        evidence that the Libyan authorities are  going  to  resolve  their
        security crisis in the near  future,  if  at  all,  and  there  are
        growing fears that if the government falls there is the  danger  of
        civil war.

   188. Professor Joff� was asked  by  way  of  written  questions  by  the
        respondent to supply further information on  the  progress  of  the
        bill treating rape  as  a  war  crime  during  armed  conflict  and
        requiring compensation to  victims  of  sexual  violence,  and  the
        progress of gender-equality legislation pledged by Justice Minister
        Salah Bashir Al-Marghani.

   189. Professor Joff�'s response is dated 31 October 2013. He states that
        according to his sources there  has  been  no  progress  on  either
        issue. The rape bill is only in draft form and has not been further
        discussed since July. He suggests that this may be because the  GNC
        has collectively assumed that  compensation  for  rape  and  sexual
        violence is covered by  the  Transitional  Justice  Law  passed  in
        September 2013, which covers  compensation  in  relation  to  human
        rights violations during the liberation. The  gender  equality  law
        has not progressed beyond the draft stage either and is in any case
        only the suggestion of a minister. He describes the GNC as being in
        a state of considerable disarray.

   Professor Joff�-oral evidence

   190. In examination-in-chief on behalf of AMH Professor Joff� said  that
        he was last in Libya 10 years ago but has kept in touch with events
        there.

   191. In relation to the number of militias in Libya, he  said  that  the
        conventional answer is that there are about 350 but it  depends  on
        how militia is defined.

   192. In relation to the Political Isolation Law (barring anyone who held
        any  position  under  the  former  regime  from  holding   official
        positions), that would exclude up to half the population.

   193. The bomb blast in the marketplace on 4 August 2012 in Tripoli was a
        consequence of a dispute in the market. There is no question of  it
        being directed against particular individuals. The three car  bombs
        that exploded in Tripoli on August 19  were  not  directed  towards
        individuals but were part of a general tendency (for that  sort  of
        action)  during  Ramadan.  They  were  designed  to  cause   public
        insecurity and anxiety and were quite indiscriminate. Although only
        two people were killed they were  designed  to  cause  considerable
        loss of life to people on the streets and around the  locations  of
        the bombs.

   194. Large numbers of people in Bani Walid, and throughout  the  country
        were employed by the former regime. It is  believed  that  a  large
        number of assassinations in Benghazi and Tripoli have been  against
        opponents of the former regime.  This  is  based  on  reports  from
        local officials in Libya.

   195. Although some militias are paid by the government they  have  their
        own objectives. The position has not changed because of events over
        the weekend. Some units have apparently withdrawn over the last two
        days. This is a fairly common  feature  and  happened  in  Benghazi
        where militias withdrew but returned after a short period of  time.
        There is a suspicion that the  Misrata  militia  will  return  even
        though they face opposition from the Zintan militia. Militias often
        have more than one objective and often  become  criminalised.  They
        increasingly charge protection  money  as  a  tax  at  checkpoints,
        especially going south to Sabha, and  militias  being  involved  in
        smuggling operations across the Sahara. He believes that the Zintan
        militia are in charge at Tripoli airport.

   196. Zawiye is controlled by the Zawiye militia which has been extremely
        active in suppressing pro-Qadhafi activity in Bani Walid.

   197. As to what AMH could expect on return to Zawiye, having been in the
        UK when the uprising took  place,  he  would  face  the  fact  that
        militia control movement and the way people are treated depends  on
        how they are viewed by the militia.

   198. As a Black Libyan he would face profound  racism.  Particularly  in
        the  context  of  Zawiye  he  is  likely  to  suffer   considerable
        discrimination  and  persecution  simply  because  of  his   ethnic
        origins.

   199. As to whether there are checkpoints on the way to Zawiye, it varies
        depending on  the  activities  of  the  local  militia.  There  are
        checkpoints outside the airport on the approach to  Tripoli.  There
        could be checkpoints inside the town of Zawiye.  It  is  true  that
        checkpoints can suddenly pop up. The incident in Tripoli last  week
        occurred at just such a checkpoint.

   200. He had learnt this morning that the Secretary of State had  resumed
        enforced returns to Libya. He was  surprised  as  the  Foreign  and
        Commonwealth Office advise no travel to  Libya  and  the  objective
        circumstances have not altered.

   201. He is surprised that the police prevented the public protest at the
        destruction of Sufi shrines by Salafist groups. On the  other  hand
        he is not surprised because of the politicisation of the  militias.
        Sufism is now regarded as something to  be  condemned.  The  police
        would have been very much  intimidated  by  the  militias  who  are
        heavily armed, whereas the police are not.

   202. Libya is well on the way to becoming a failing state because it  is
        unable to contain the violence.

   203. It is difficult to determine the number of Black Libyans.  He  does
        not know how many Black Libyans who are  citizens  of  Libya.  They
        could amount to a third or a half of the  Libyan  population.  They
        are regarded as inferior and as a source  of  criminality  and  the
        false sector economy. During the civil war  a  large  part  of  the
        anger was directed towards mercenary forces who were considered  to
        be black, including the Tuareg and sub-Saharan  Africans  who  were
        said to have been responsible for the worst abuses.

   204. As regards AMH, he  is  not  sure  how  people  would  be  able  to
        distinguish his ethnicity. Physical characteristics would not allow
        a distinction to be made between sub-Saharan  and  so-called  Black
        Libyans. At a checkpoint he could very easily be considered to have
        been involved with the Qadhafi regime. It is  the  case  therefore,
        that up to a third of the population are in the same position.

   205. The government does not have the means  to  offer  any  protection.
        There is an embryonic police force with 1,000  members.  There  are
        the remnants of an army said to number 7,000 but the retraining has
        not been completed. There are also  prejudices  that  exist  (which
        would affect whether a person could be protected)

   206. The family book contains details of the family, including dates  of
        birth of the children, marriages and  residence.  It  is  essential
        information as part of the documentation process.  Normally  people
        have it as showing a right of  abode.  In  theory  people  need  to
        register with the police but at the moment that is more theory than
        practice. A newcomer would be noticed  and  the  local  authorities
        would want to know where the person came from. However, that  would
        be with a functioning  state.  People  are  attempting  to  provide
        administration but some people also use informal principles.

   207. He is not saying that Tripoli is safe but perhaps safer than  other
        parts of the country. Even that is rather doubtful given the events
        of last weekend.

   208. Tripoli has a population of about 1.3 million and including all the
        surrounding areas is about 2-2� million. The same principles  apply
        there in relation to a stranger appearing in the locality. In small
        neighbourhoods it would not be so easy for AMH to move  in  without
        being noticed. With his ethnicity it would be pretty obvious.

   209. It is true that there  would  be  several  hundred  thousand  black
        people in Tripoli but the population of black  people  tend  to  be
        settled in shanty towns and a  black  person  would  be  especially
        obvious in the centre. Parts of Tripoli have a black community  but
        they have the same sense of community. They do not have  their  own
        militia.

   210. In examination-in-chief on behalf of HKA, Professor Joff� said that
        Takfir wa Hirja (referred to at para 38 of his  12  September  2013
        report on behalf of HKA) is a salafi-jihadi group created in  Egypt
        in the 1970's, based on the principle of withdrawal from society to
        develop an Islamic lifestyle and attacking the dominant  lifestyle.
        As far as he knows there are continued  skirmishes  involving  that
        group. However, there is not much  information  that  he  has  come
        across in relation to the situation  at  Benghazi  airport.  It  is
        controlled by Libyan special forces  but  who  are  under  constant
        pressure from groups who previously controlled the airport and  who
        want to get back what was a very lucrative opportunity.

   211. He is not aware of exclusive neighbourhoods  that  are  for  people
        from Benghazi or Tripoli

   212. In cross-examination, in relation to the  issue  of  indiscriminate
        violence, he said that that issue is one of predictability which is
        a measure of the indiscriminate violence. An example is the  events
        of  last  week  when   the   local   population   were   peacefully
        demonstrating and  were  fired  on  by  militias.  Those  sorts  of
        circumstances are unpredictable. It cannot be known from one moment
        to another whether there is going to be an incident.

   213. Professor Joff� disagreed with the suggestion that the issue is not
        one of predictability but an assessment of whether all Libyans  are
        at risk of serious harm. Violence in Libya tends to be extreme. The
        levels of violence are far higher than they would  be  in  a  well-
        ordered society and are reported in an active local press. One  can
        walk in the street and find oneself in the middle  of  a  firefight
        between two  different  groups.  That  happens  regularly  and  the
        population objects very strongly.

   214. The gun battle in Tripoli on 4 August referred to in his report  of
        4 October 2013 at para 7, started, as far as he  remembers,  as  an
        argument between market sellers. Then someone set off a  car  bomb.
        He is unable to give further details as he had  hitherto  not  been
        asked to provide them.  As  to  the  suggestion  that  a  car  bomb
        requires planning, he said that no-one  was  quite  sure  what  the
        explosion contained. One does come across quite a few such  reports
        of indiscriminate attacks although mostly at government targets.

   215. It is true that the  unexploded  bombs  referred  to  in  the  same
        paragraph of his report tend to target either foreign  people  such
        as embassies or military and defence buildings.

   216.  There  have  been  confrontations  because  of  the  heavy  handed
        behaviour of the Libyan Shield Force. This concerns  crowd  control
        and at checkpoints. This  would  provoke  further  incidents  which
        would end up with shooting, although very often in the air.

   217. He is not sure of the targets of the three car bombs in Tripoli  on
        19 August 2012 but they were placed in such a way as  to  catch  as
        many people in the street as possible.  As  to  reports  suggesting
        that they were meant to kill police or military forces, he does not
        know if that is the  case  but  it  is  during  Ramadan  that  such
        techniques are used. Bani Walid is now occupied by several militias
        and is relatively quiet.

   218. As to his evidence that the belief is that  those  responsible  for
        the violence are Qadhafi supporters, it is difficult to say whether
        they are seeking to provoke a counter  revolution  to  restore  the
        former regime. People involved in the attacks are said to have been
        connected with the former regime.

   219. The assassinations in Benghazi are targeted which is not always the
        case elsewhere and there are other ways of victimising a particular
        group of people. There are also arbitrary arrests  and  detentions.
        The number of those assassinated, kidnapped and imprisoned in Libya
        amounts to about 10,000. The conventional number of those  said  to
        be held in prisons is about 7,000 people but no-one  really  knows.
        That is not a massive number but is a significant number  when  one
        considers the population  of  Libya  which  is  about  5.6  million
        people. That is enough for  people  to  feel  very  insecure  as  a
        result.

   220. Nearly all the arrests were in the first six months to a year after
        the conflict. There is no effective judicial procedure  and  a  lot
        have been in detention ever since. As to whether the population  of
        those imprisoned is therefore fairly constant he said that  because
        these are private prisons no-one can really tell. It is also  quite
        common for people to be kidnapped for  ransom  which  adds  to  the
        insecurity. He  could  have  provided  more  evidence  of  violence
        incidents (had he been asked).

   221. In relation to demonstrators being met  with  gunfire  in  June  in
        Benghazi and last weekend, those are  two  dramatic  incidents  but
        there have been other demonstrations that have been  dispersed  and
        people shot at at checkpoints.

   222. Black Libyans such as AMH do not exactly suffer the  same  fate  as
        the Tawurgans but Black Libyans are thought to have been supportive
        of the Qadhafi regime so they would suffer  as  the  Tawurgans  do.
        There is also discrimination.

   223. As to whether the experience of the Tawurgans can be generalised to
        include all Black Libyans, they  are  symbolic  of  Black  Libyans.
        Tawurga was targeted because it was believed  that  they  supported
        the Qadhafi regime, and some did. There were reports  of  organised
        rapes by Tawurgans  in  Misrata  and  the  Misrata  militia  sought
        revenge on all Tawurgans who were forced out of Tawurga.  They  are
        displaced across Libya. He does not agree that  the  experience  of
        the Tawurgans cannot be generalised to include all  Black  Libyans.
        Most, if not all, Qadhafi's mercenary forces  were  assumed  to  be
        black, to have been  supportive  of  Qadhafi  and  are  persecuted,
        including the Tibu. Tawurgans were a special case of this  as  were
        the Tuareg. It is a generalised phenomenon to do with colour.

   224. In terms of whether large scale arrests of Black Libyans  and  sub-
        Saharan Africans ceased in 2012, they have either all been arrested
        or have been displaced. Sub-Saharan Africans do remain at  risk  of
        being charged with illegal entry, and  of  supporting  the  Qadhafi
        regime.

   225. Professor Joff� was asked about an Amnesty International report  of
        June 2013 stating that a number of migrants are flowing  back  into
        the country to work. He said that he could not comment  on  whether
        they were coming back to work. Libya is heavily  reliant  on  those
        migrant workers. It is possible that migrant flows into Libya  have
        resumed. It is not necessarily the case that  if  they  were  being
        persecuted there would be reports of it. It depends on  the  extent
        of the reporting outside the capital.

   226. It does not strike him as odd that AMH claimed that there were only
        two black families in Zawiye. He is not able to make any  judgement
        as to whether or not that is true but  the  dislike  of  blacks  in
        Zawiye is very intense. He took from AMH's witness  statement  that
        there were only two black families in Zawiye. He read it  as  being
        in relation to the whole of Zawiye.

   227. He is not saying that Tripoli airport is unsafe  to  pass  through;
        people do so regularly. In so far as it  is  militarily  controlled
        the issue is one of  unpredictability.  Benghazi  airport  is  more
        unsafe because of the struggle for control of it.

   228. In relation to the family book, there is no greater  risk  in  this
        regard for people returning from the UK.

   229. So far as the travel restrictions to the south of the  country  are
        concerned, generally speaking the area is shut  off  but  a  person
        returning home if resident in that area  would  probably  be  given
        permission to travel there. The area of the travel restriction  was
        marked on a map.

   230. There are restrictions in terms of internal relocation by reason of
        the way in which individual towns are now  governed.  Misrata  will
        not let people in. Derna is a well known Islamist  stronghold.  The
        oil area of Sirt is restricted because of the oil  industry.  There
        are a lot of territories in Libya that  are  difficult  to  access.
        Zawiye is a provincial capital in its own right.

   231. He is aware that a number of airlines serve  Tripoli  airport.  Air
        Malta flies there every day and BA four times a week. With  BA  the
        majority of the flights are in relation to  contracts.  That  tells
        him that the Libyan government is trying to revive the economy.

   232. It is possible, depending on the case,  that  a  person  could  use
        tribal affiliations in order  to  relocate.  Asked  to  comment  on
        evidence given by Dr Porter  that  it  was  hard  to  believe  that
        someone would not have contacts in Tripoli, he said that this would
        depend on many things including the extent to which the person  had
        used those links over their lifetime.

   233. It is probably reasonable to suppose that  many  people  given  the
        current circumstances are unable to find or have lost their  family
        book.

   234. In re-examination he said that there is an artificial calm in  Bani
        Walid because the militias are hostile to  the  population,  as  in
        Sirt. Arrests have continued since the conflict.  He does not think
        that things have moved on in relation  to  Black  Libyans  but  the
        situation is not the same as it was a year or two ago.

   235. ENI, a major Italian oil conglomerate, has moved out of  Libya  and
        BP suspended operations at the time of the conflict and  they  have
        not resumed.








                                 APPENDIX E

                                 SUBMISSIONS



Submissions on behalf of the Respondent

     1. Throughout Mr Palmer's submissions  we  were  referred  to  various
        aspects of the  Respondent's  skeleton  argument.  In  relation  to
        Article 15(c), taking as  a  starting  point  the  position  of  an
        'ordinary' Libyan, we were referred to the  decisions  in  Elgafagi
        and QD (Iran).

     2. Mr Palmer submitted that Dr George's evidence  was  to  the  effect
        that there was no longer an active conflict. It was true,  however,
        that there were areas where there were higher levels  of  violence,
        for example Benghazi where there  are  targeted  assassinations  of
        security forces and outside government buildings.  Dr  George  said
        that he would be happy to visit Zawiye,  Tripoli  and  Misrata,  as
        well as Benghazi, although in respect of the  latter  he  would  be
        more cautious. His view was consistent with that of Dr  Porter.  It
        was clear that indiscriminate violence was  not  being  used  as  a
        political tool, there being no bombings of market places or  random
        firing at civilians by snipers.

     3.  Professor   Joff�'s   emphasis   was   different,   focussing   on
        predictability, but such  violence  is  always  unpredictable.  The
        question to be asked is how frequent are the violent incidents  and
        over what areas. There was no  evidence  of  such  high  levels  of
        violence in any part of Libya. We  were  further  referred  to  the
        written expert evidence from all three experts.

     4. There may be particular features of an individual  where  the  risk
        would be elevated, albeit that not everyone would be at risk.  This
        is described as a sliding scale. No such factors  are  apparent  in
        the cases of any of the appellants.

     5. We were referred to the "taxonomy" of violence as described in  the
        report of Dr  Porter.  The  first  category  is  of  confrontations
        between different ethnic groups or groups from  different  regions.
        The expert evidence was  to  the  effect  that  incidents  of  such
        violence, as in Kuffra  and  Bani  Walid,  could  flare  up  again.
        However, if the question is  asked  as  to  whether  there  is  now
        indiscriminate violence in terms of Article 15(c),  the  answer  is
        no.

     6. In terms of the second category of violence (politically  motivated
        violence), these are not incidents in which particular  individuals
        are targeted but  there  have  been  casualties.  This  relates  to
        Tripoli and Benghazi. Again, it  is  accepted  that  there  may  be
        further incidents of the same kind in the  future.  However,  there
        are no individual characteristics which would increase  that  risk.
        Although there have been bombs outside police offices,  and  police
        officers may be more at risk if they are guarding such places, that
        would not be relevant to anyone returning from the UK.

     7. The third category of Islamist violence, submitted Mr Palmer,  does
        establish that former high level officers in Qadhafi's intelligence
        services are at high  risk  of  being  targeted  but  the  evidence
        establishes that those  attacks  are  sophisticated  and  carefully
        planned. Dr Porter had referred to sophisticated  car  bombs  which
        are not intended to injure anyone else. The same  can  be  said  in
        relation to the targeted shootings.

     8. In the forth category are general crimes of violence, more  evident
        in Benghazi than in Tripoli.  However,  it  is  not  indiscriminate
        violence and there is no suggestion that any particular  categories
        are at greater risk on the sliding scale.

     9.  In  relation  to  the  fifth  category   of   violence   (targeted
        assassinations and bombings) Mr Joff� was less  certain  that  such
        incidents were necessarily so 'targeted'.

    10. Category six (recent attacks on peaceful protestors/demonstrators),
        it was suggested, was the closest that could be argued in terms  of
        indiscriminate violence but the risk is  not  a  generalised  risk,
        such incidents occurring on discrete occasions. There was no reason
        to believe that any particular category of person was at  risk.  It
        is possible that in future there may be similar demonstrations  and
        it is possible that the militias will respond in a similar way  but
        the risks will be known to those who want to  participate  in  such
        demonstrations, and those who do not participate would  not  be  at
        risk in that regard.

    11. Article 15(c) risk has not therefore been established.

    12.  Dealing  with  potential  risk  categories   under   the   Refugee
        Convention, referring to the skeleton argument at [25]-[27],  there
        is no risk to failed asylum seekers and such  an  individual  would
        not be seen as having pro-Qadhafi sentiments. The  evidence  of  Dr
        Porter supported that view. It was not uncommon for Libyans to have
        been  abroad  and  they  would  not  invite  suspicion  on  return,
        according to the evidence of Dr Porter.

    13. Turning to the individual appeals, Mr Palmer  submitted  that  that
        was sufficient to dispose of the appeal in relation to AT who could
        not therefore claim to be at risk as a  failed  asylum  seeker  and
        would not be at risk in relation to Article 15(c). The same applies
        in relation to AE-S and HKA.

    14. So  far  as  women  are  concerned,  there  is  discrimination  and
        harassment and there may  be  suspicion  in  relation  to  a  woman
        travelling alone. However, the evidence does not support the  claim
        that  a  woman  in  those  circumstances  would  be  subjected   to
        persecution. Paragraph 3.11 of the OGN refers to the situation  for
        women  who  have  been  raped  who  may  be  at  greater  risk   of
        discrimination but this is not raised as an issue by  HKA.  In  any
        event, that was not a matter  that  is  at  the  forefront  of  the
        Secretary of State's case  although  the  experts  were  asked  for
        written responses to questions in relation to the anti-rape law.

    15. HKA would not be travelling alone. She would be travelling with her
        brother. The evidence was that flights from Tripoli to Benghazi are
        cheap and with $50 being provided  to  returnees.  There  is  other
        general assistance available. Dr Porter  also  gave  evidence  that
        people could travel via inter city taxi.

    16. As set out  in  the  skeleton  argument  at  [30]  in  relation  to
        perceived Qadhafi supporters,  the  May  2013  OGN  and  the  other
        evidence supported the view that they may be at risk on return.  It
        is not suggested that there has been  any  change  in  that  regard
        since May 2013. However, it is not accepted that anyone  associated
        with perceived supporters  would  be  at  risk.  According  to  the
        evidence of Professor Joff�, up to 70% of the population worked for
        the Qadhafi regime, a point  also  made  by  Dr  Porter.  Including
        family members therefore, would mean that the vast majority of  the
        population were associated with the regime. There is  one  reported
        incident of a family member, the daughter of  Abdullah  Al-Senussi,
        being kidnapped but then released without having been harmed.

    17. The possibility of "collateral risk" to  a  family  member  from  a
        targeted attack cannot be ruled  out,  but  the  evidence  is  that
        individuals are carefully targeted. The risk  in  this  respect  is
        speculative. There is no guarantee of safety but such  a  guarantee
        is not required.

    18. There is evidence of many still remaining in the detention  of  the
        militias but there is not now in existence  the  same  campaign  to
        apprehend Qadhafi supporters or perceived supporters as  there  was
        at the end of the campaign against the regime.

    19. There is a distinction to be  made  between  Tawurgans  and  'Black
        Libyans'. There is no question of Tawurgans being able to return to
        Tawurga; they would be physically prevented from doing so, the town
        having been destroyed and being empty.  Any  Tawurgan  returned  to
        Libya would be internally displaced. Dr George's evidence was  that
        Tawurgans were not being hunted  down.  Many  would  be  living  in
        shanty towns on the periphery of major settlements.  However,  they
        may be expected to face risks at  checkpoints  if  found  to  be  a
        Tawurgan, particularly if it is a checkpoint manned by the  Misrata
        militia.

    20. The objective and expert evidence does not support  the  contention
        that all Black Libyans would be  at  risk  of  persecution  on  the
        grounds of ethnicity. It would be going too far  to  say  that  all
        Tawurgans would be at risk. They are internally  displaced  and  do
        live in Libya, although in many individual cases the risk would  be
        established. However, there may be cases where a Tawurgan has  very
        good links in Tripoli. Others who have further afield to travel may
        encounter the  Misrata  militia  at  a  checkpoint.  It  cannot  be
        excluded that such a person may be detained.

    21. The hypothetical exceptions to that risk may be  rare.  Almost  all
        Tawurgans would be in need of (international) protection but  there
        is a need to consider the individual circumstances as per the  OGN.
        One could not go so far as to say that all Tawurgans  are  at  risk
        but it may be difficult to  find  individual  cases  where  such  a
        person may not be at risk.

    22. There is no dispute but that Black Libyans have been the victims of
        racism and discrimination; all the experts  agree  on  that.  Libya
        could be described as a racist society.  The  question  is  whether
        that discrimination reaches the threshold of persecution.  Although
        the  findings  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  in  relation  to  the
        discrimination that AMH suffered are to be borne  in  mind,  it  is
        also the case that he has been in work, has received  an  education
        and was able to have a family life. He lived in Zawiye and  it  was
        only when he left that the family moved to outside Zawiye where his
        parents lived. The conclusion of the First-tier  Tribunal  that  he
        has suffered discrimination but not persecution is defensible.

    23. There is no doubt that during the war a real issue was the  general
        perception that Qadhafi's forces were bolstered by  African  forces
        from other countries but that perception is now known to have  been
        overstated. Mercenaries were used but not to the  extent  that  had
        been supposed. The perception  did  lead  to  sweeping  arrests  of
        anyone perceived to be a Qadhafi supporter or fighter. The evidence
        does  show  that  Black  Libyans  and  sub-Saharan  Africans   were
        subjected to torture. We were referred to some  of  the  background
        material on this issue. The Qawalish were also  suspected  to  have
        been Qadhafi supporters and the Mashashiya also suffered.

    24. The Tribunal is not directly concerned  with  Sub-Saharan  Africans
        being returned to Libya. There is, however, a distinction  made  in
        the background evidence between Libyan and foreign  nationals.  The
        expert evidence was that an individual would  be  able  to  explain
        where  they  were  from  and  their  accent  would  also  give   an
        indication. The evidence does not show that Black Libyans  are  now
        being  rounded  up  and  arrested  on  the  basis  that  they  were
        mercenaries. One could not go so far as to say  that  if  a  person
        were not from Mashashiya or Tawurga then that person would  not  be
        at risk, given that  the  entire  communities  were  at  risk  from
        specific militia for specific reasons.

    25. The position of foreign workers was precarious  and  there  was  an
        outflow of those workers but they  are  returning.  That  does  not
        indicate that they  are  not  at  risk  of  racism  but  it  is  an
        indication of change since 2011. There is no suggestion that  black
        people generally are being detained. Such detentions  are  specific
        to foreign workers who are not entitled to be in Libya. The country
        would not be a 'magnet' destination, however, if the fate of  those
        coming into the country would be persecution.  Dr  George  said  in
        evidence that it was an overstatement to  say  that  Black  Libyans
        were being detained as suspected Qadhafi fighters. He said that  it
        was not a serious or real risk but said that there is  a  potential
        risk when such an individual  is  confronted  at  a  checkpoint  by
        someone who he described as a 17 year old with a Kalashnikov.

    26. Dr Porter said that Black Libyans are to be  found  moving  around,
        mostly doing unskilled jobs. He  did  also  refer  however  to  the
        representative of OPEC in  Libya  being  black.  He  did  not  have
        evidence of black people being  detained  on  the  basis  of  being
        suspected of having been a mercenary for Qadhafi. If there was such
        evidence one would have expected Dr Porter to have heard about it.

    27. Professor Joff� alone put the matter higher, suggesting that  Black
        Libyans were at risk of persecution. He referred to the experiences
        of the Tawurgans but also the  Warshfanna,  who  are  not  in  fact
        black. When asked whether  he  was  generalising  the  position  of
        Tawurgans in terms of black people he gave a variety of answers but
        agreed that he was generalising. His  evidence  would  have  to  be
        weighed against that of Dr George and  Dr  Porter  and  the  recent
        background evidence.

    28. Professor Joff�'s expertise is not in issue but  his  evidence  did
        show a tendency to generalise more widely than the  other  evidence
        disclosed. A particularly striking example was his  willingness  to
        understand AMH's evidence that there were only two  black  families
        in Zawiye, out of a population of 291,000. AMH himself had not made
        that claim about only two black families; he said  in  his  witness
        statement that this was in his  neighbourhood.  Dr  Porter,  unlike
        Professor Joff�, had visited Zawiye in the last few months and  had
        seen evidence of black people  there.  Dr  George  did  not  except
        Zawiye from the population of black people. Two experts had been to
        Zawiye and had  a  different  perception  of  the  level  of  risk,
        especially for Black Libyans.

    29. Dr Porter gave evidence  of  the  "possibility"  of  detention  for
        unexplained reasons, for example a perceived insult if one  is  not
        from the same territory as the militia. However, he  gave  evidence
        of the level of traffic that passes through  checkpoints  and  that
        traffic is actually a problem. The day-to-day experience of Libyans
        is that there is a mere possibility of detention  but  not  a  real
        risk, which does not reach the level of seriousness required.

    30. Souq  Al-Juma'a  is  where  AT  comes  from.  People  from  certain
        districts in Tripoli may be thought to have more  association  with
        Qadhafi than people from other districts, but the risk  to  such  a
        person was speculative.

    31. The evidence is that the airport is safe and there are no  reported
        concerns in  relation  to  passengers  arriving  there.  There  are
        regular flights to Tripoli by BA and Al-Italia. People  wishing  to
        travel to Benghazi could go there by air, bus or taxi. Zawiye is  a
        short distance away. Special permission is needed to travel to  the
        southern zones but the evidence was that  this  would  not  prevent
        someone who was from that area returning there.

    32. The table of  returns  since  2011  shows  the  numbers  of  forced
        removals  of  Libyans  although  it  does  not  show   what   their
        destinations were, not necessarily  showing  enforced  removals  to
        Libya. There is no detail in the table of the  actual  destinations
        or onward destinations. In any event, that table is of no weight in
        terms of the issues, it having been produced only because the issue
        of returns was raised.

    33.  It  is  accepted  that  there  is  no  national  police  force  to
        investigate and detect crime and no nationally effective judiciary.
        However, to say that  there  is  "no  effective  judiciary"  is  an
        overstatement. There is a judiciary which is independent.  However,
        each case (where this is  an  issue)  has  to  be  assessed  on  an
        individual basis. Someone from Misrata will enjoy the protection of
        the Misrata militia. Dr Porter said that a person can ally  with  a
        particular militia and he described them as highly disciplined  and
        hierarchical  structures.  They  have   'secured   the   government
        contract' to supply policing services and that is what the militias
        are there to do. It is the case, however, that there  is  sometimes
        conflict with other communities. There  is  not  a  sufficiency  of
        protection everywhere but again each case is fact specific.

    34. Internal relocation would not be available for those  in  the  main
        risk  categories,  for  example  former  high  level   intelligence
        officers and Tawurgans. For others, however, who face a  threat  in
        the local area, relocation to Tripoli  for  example  would  not  in
        ordinary circumstances be unduly harsh.

    35. Professor Joff� gave evidence that someone who  is  isolated  would
        find it very hard to relocate and find  employment  but  the  other
        experts presented a more nuanced picture. Dr George thought that it
        would be possible to  establish  networks.  There  is  a  spectrum.
        Generally, people live within families but tribal  affiliation  can
        also be relevant.  Dr  Porter,  it  was  submitted,  was  the  most
        realistic of all  in  his  evidence  in  that  he  said  that  with
        reference to Tripoli he would find it very hard to believe that  an
        individual would have no contacts at all there given the small size
        and intimacy of Libyan society.

    36. AMH's case is a good example in that he  has  family  and  extended
        family in Libya. He has a brother in Tripoli, two  brothers  and  a
        sister in Zawiye, with uncles and  aunts  in  Tripoli,  Zawiye  and
        Zuwara.  There  is  no  reason  to  think  that  his  situation  is
        particularly unusual. There are many people living in  Tripoli  who
        are from Benghazi and vice versa.

    37. The evidence in relation to the family book does not apply  in  any
        differential way to asylum seekers (from the UK). The issue is  the
        same for all Libyans and the evidence  is  that  it  would  not  be
        unusual for many Libyans to be in the situation  of  not  having  a
        family book given the country's circumstances.

    38. Although AMH's evidence is that he does not think that it  is  safe
        for black people in Libya, that perception overstates  matters.  He
        is from Zawiye and is not in a risk category. He is able to  return
        there or relocate to Tripoli, as his brother did in 2009.

    39. There are credibility issues in terms of his evidence that  he  has
        not had contact with his parents, wife and  children  since  August
        2011. In his second witness statement  in  2012  he  said  that  he
        called them two weeks prior to the hearing  before  the  First-tier
        Tribunal. In that call he said  that  the  family  had  decided  to
        escape. Since then he had not been able to contact them  and  their
        phone is not being answered. It was not credible that he would  not
        have informed the First-tier judge of the content of that  call  in
        terms of their deciding  to  escape.  It  was  a  matter  that  was
        similarly not referred to in  the  grounds  seeking  permission  to
        appeal against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.  The  notes
        of the evidence at that hearing indicate  that  he  said  that  his
        family  were  still  there  and  the  grounds  of  application  for
        permission to appeal also reflect that evidence.  His  evidence  in
        this respect was an embellishment. It is not  accepted  that  there
        was a lack of contact.

    40. AMH would have been very anxious to find out what had  happened  to
        his family but he has not given an account of any determined effort
        to contact anyone in Libya. He said that for some of them he had no
        phone numbers but they have his number. The tracing request through
        the Red Cross was not made until March and has not vigorously  been
        pursued.  Subsequent appointments with the Red Cross had  not  been
        made or kept.

    41. AMH said that his friend had called him and  said  that  there  had
        been an attack on the family at the end of January 2012. The family
        was still in the house in August 2012 and the question arises as to
        why there was no attempt to contact them, or ask his  friend  H  to
        visit the house. In relation to his wife's family he said  that  he
        was thinking about contacting them and this had caused  him  to  be
        diabetic, but that does not explain why he has made  no  effort  to
        make contact.

    42. His friend had had telephone contact with his  brother.  He  had  a
        brother in Egypt who is said to  have  been  famous  in  Libya  but
        apparently not in Egypt. The most striking evidence of  fabrication
        is his account in relation to his friend H who it  seems  gives  an
        account at just the right time of people being arrested because the
        appellant had  phoned  them  rather  than  because  they  had  been
        demonstrating.

    43. In any event, his evidence is that he is a well known  opponent  of
        the Qadhafi regime and  he  and  his  brother  are  leading  lights
        locally in terms of opposing the regime. He would therefore be well
        known in the area for that reason and would not be at risk of being
        suspected as a supporter of Qadhafi.

    44. In answer to a question from the Tribunal, Mr Palmer submitted that
        the evidence does not show that there would be risk to an  opponent
        of the Qadhafi regime by any resurgent pro-Qadhafi group. Dr Porter
        said there was no  prospect  of  any  such  group  carrying  out  a
        rearguard action. Professor Joff� said that there  may  be  revenge
        attacks against 'turncoat' soldiers but the other experts  were  of
        the view that the Islamists were responsible for such attacks.

    45. As to other ethnic groups, the Tuareg and  Tibu  had  already  been
        referred to.  It was not suggested that there was  any  persecution
        of the Berbers who are well  represented  in  Parliament,  and  had
        indeed occupied the Parliament building on one occasion. It is true
        to say however, there had been discrimination of the Berbers  under
        Qadhafi.

Submissions on behalf of AT

    46. Mr Ficklin accepted that the  information  provided  by  Mr  Palmer
        revealed that there were enforced removals of Libyans when  it  was
        thought that at the time there were none.

    47. In relation to Article 15(c),  Mr  Ficklin  said  that  he  had  no
        instructions to and did not concede that issue but he would not  be
        making submissions on it.

    48. The GNC is a nominal government and is not in  charge.  Who  is  in
        charge depends on the local situation. The  GNC  is  only  able  to
        exert authority to the extent that various militias are willing  to
        exert their authority as a proxy for  the  GNC.  They  exert  their
        authority to further their own interests. At  times  these  overlap
        those of the GNC, for example in relation  to  undertaking  airport
        security.

    49. In relation to detentions, these involve a  real  risk  of  serious
        harm especially at the early stages of detention by militias.  Even
        in government controlled facilities there is a risk. Reference  was
        made to the OGN  and  other  background  material  in  relation  to
        torture and the types of detention facilities. The number  detained
        by militias is uncertain with figures of between 5,000-10,000 being
        given but these figures are nothing other than a guess. It  is  not
        even known how many detention facilities  there  are.  Dr  Porter's
        evidence was that there are further detentions taking place.

    50. There is evidence of the abduction of  Qadhafi  supporters  and  of
        pure criminality, as well as the protection by  militias  of  their
        business activities, in relation to arrests of  Qadhafi  supporters
        and their family members but the numbers are not known.

    51. Although it has been suggested on behalf of the respondent that the
        militias keep the peace and may be able to provide  sufficiency  of
        protection, if it results in detention  that  raises  the  risk  of
        serious harm. There is no sufficiency of protection. There are many
        examples of new detentions  for  non-political  reasons  and  where
        people have died in custody. In answer to a  point  we  raised,  Mr
        Ficklin said that it could not be acceptable for  non-state  actors
        who breach human rights to be the actors of protection.   Even  the
        quasi-legitimate functions of the militias raise a real risk  of  a
        violation of an individual's human rights.

    52. There is evidence in the UN  report  of  new  detentions  of  those
        thought to support the Qadhafi regime and their family members.  It
        has never been suggested that anyone who had a government job would
        be at risk, for example "a bin man". In cases of  family,  however,
        they would be collectively identified as a  family  of  supporters.
        Black Libyans were not targeted because  they  were  supporters  or
        mercenaries but because there were black people who were.  This  is
        the same  as  it  is  for  Tawurgans  and  Mashashyans.  Collective
        identity is a feature of Libyan society.

    53. Although there are targeted  attacks  against  former  intelligence
        officers, the UN report also refers to attacks on  family  members.
        It is also to be noted that it is said  to  be  difficult  to  find
        lawyers to represent individuals who are former  Qadhafi  loyalists
        which  is  another  example  of  collective  identity.  The  expert
        evidence was  that  in  the  case  of  Tawurgans  and  Mashashyans,
        collective identity would take  precedence  over  personal  factors
        which would require investigation and proof, but in Libya  none  is
        needed for detention. There may be cases where an  individual  with
        "immutable characteristics" would be at risk at a checkpoint.

    54. For the most part  there  would  be  no  such  thing  as  anonymous
        relocation. There may be exceptions for those who do not depend  on
        networks. However, those networks may still communicate the fact of
        someone new coming into an area. Someone without a network would be
        even more unusual. If such a person is at risk in  the  home  area,
        relocation even to Tripoli would not be  possible.  That,  however,
        does not apply in the case of AT.

    55. Although recent events in Tripoli  are  relevant,  for  example  in
        terms of militia having been told to leave an area, the evidence is
        that the militia leave an area and then simply return.

Submissions on behalf of AMH

    56. Ms Patel referred us to various aspects of the background evidence,
        AMH's witness statement and her skeleton argument. The  appellant's
        father was in the army for  30  years  and  his  brother  moved  to
        Tripoli. Black H are the weakest group, he says, and Zawiye was not
        a safe place for his family. Zawiye is now under the control of the
        Zawiye militia. The appellant's  account  is  consistent  with  the
        background evidence of what was happening in that area.

    57. AMH did mention to the First-tier Tribunal the phone call from  his
        wife. His evidence that his family had decided to leave is  in  his
        witness statement. The evidence was that at the time  he  left  his
        wife and children with his family. In the phone call he had said in
        evidence to the First-tier Tribunal that his wife  appeared  scared
        and that the call only lasted about five minutes. He had said  that
        communications had been cut off. He had tried to  ring  them  every
        day.

    58. The appellant's  witness,  NS,  gave  evidence  to  the  First-tier
        Tribunal that the appellant would be at risk because of his  colour
        and would be perceived to be part of the forces that supported  the
        regime. The evidence was not clear on the numbers of black families
        in the area. Because no-one could tell  where  a  black  person  is
        from, that would put him at risk. There was evidence  from  another
        witness who was not called before the First-tier  Tribunal  because
        he had left the country. In  cross-examination  (before  the  Upper
        Tribunal) the appellant had said that he did not have  the  details
        of his brother. We were referred to the findings of the  First-tier
        judge in terms of the positive credibility findings.

    59. At the time of the  hearing  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  the
        appellant was a refugee and is still a refugee. The evidence at the
        time of the First-tier hearing is the starting point.

    60. There is evidence of recent efforts to  trace  his  family  in  the
        letters from the Red Cross and in his oral evidence. Although there
        were no further letters from the Red Cross, his evidence is that he
        kept seeing  the  Red  Cross  worker  and  asking  about  progress.
        Although it is said that he had embellished his account, that would
        not make the whole account incredible.

    61. The only expert that had been to Zawiye is Dr Porter, in August. He
        also went to Tripoli and  Misrata.  Dr  George  had  only  been  to
        Tripoli and Misrata last year. Dr Porter said that he was  able  to
        pass through the checkpoints as he was a foreign national from  the
        US, a country that had helped to get rid of Qadhafi. Although it is
        true that he was not stopped at a checkpoint, he is white  and  was
        waived through. Although it is not far from Tripoli to Zawiye,  the
        number of checkpoints is not certain and they are sometimes set  up
        at short notice.

    62. The evidence from Dr George is that there are about 1,700 militias,
        as is background evidence from the BBC, although  the  numbers  are
        not certain. In oral evidence Professor Joff� said that there  were
        about 350. At least it could be said that there are  in  excess  of
        350. The  evidence  is  that  these  militias  at  checkpoints  are
        unpredictable. If stopped, as a Black Libyan  AMH  would  be  asked
        questions and his  family  background  would  be  established.  The
        evidence accepted by the First-tier judge is that his father worked
        for 30 years in the army. His brother is also  very  religious  and
        well known in Zawiye. The question is would they  believe  that  he
        was not a Tawurgan? The evidence is that Tawurgans and  Sub-Saharan
        Africans are targeted.

    63. Even if it is thought that there is not enough  evidence  that  all
        Black Libyans are at risk, the evidence does establish  a  risk  in
        his case. Dr Porter said that there was no indication  of  how  the
        militias would behave at a checkpoint. If he was not able to pay  a
        bribe, the evidence is that that  would  lead  to  detention  which
        would then lead to a breach of Article 3 or even 2  as  people  are
        known to have died in custody.

    64. Although on behalf of the respondent it was sought to  isolate  the
        violence to  specific  areas,  it  cannot  be  looked  at  in  that
        fragmented way. All experts agreed that  Libya  was  an  inherently
        racist country. Although there was evidence  from  Drs  George  and
        Porter of Black Libyans going about their business, Dr  Porter  was
        not asked how many Black Libyans he saw or  what  their  background
        was. The fact that they go about their business does not mean  that
        they are not persecuted.  Severe  discrimination  on  a  cumulative
        basis can equate to persecution.

    65. In relation to internal relocation,  the  evidence  from  Professor
        Joff� was that south Libya is out of bounds for  all  Libyans.  For
        the appellant therefore, the options are Benghazi  or  Tripoli.  He
        would, however, need to register with the police and there  is  the
        question of the family book which  gives  access  to  benefits  and
        accommodation. There is also the harshness of relocation given  the
        evidence of shanty towns on the outskirts of the city. The  militia
        would be targeting these  areas.  It  is  true  that  there  is  no
        evidence as to whether the appellant has a family book. The  matter
        was not put to him.

    66. AMH does have a brother in Tripoli and a sister. Mr Palmer reminded
        us of the evidence in relation to other relatives the appellant has
        in Tripoli,  Zawiye  and  Zuwara.  Ms  Patel  reminded  us  of  the
        appellant's evidence that since the conflict he has had no  contact
        with those relatives.

    67. So far as the  evidence  of  enforced  returns  is  concerned,  the
        numbers are very low. It is hard to understand  why  no  statistics
        are available as to the number of Black Libyans returned when  bio-
        data is obtained when someone claims asylum. However,  it  was  not
        suggested that anything underhand was going on in terms of the lack
        of statistics. It could not be assumed,  however,  that  any  Black
        Libyans had been returned. It was  accepted  that  the  highest  it
        could be put in this respect on behalf of the appellant is that  it
        is possible for the information to have been collated  but  it  has
        not been.

    68. Although it is said that a returnee is met by a  representative  of
        the airline, that does not mean that it  would  not  be  a  militia
        member. Returns are not monitored so if something had happened to a
        returnee it is not clear that one would have heard.

    69. Since 2011 the government in Tripoli have wanted  militias  out  of
        the city. They move out and then move back in. That is the  pattern
        in Benghazi as well.

    70. Ms Patel stated that she did  not  intend  to  make  any  (further)
        submissions in relation to Article 15(c) and it was  a  matter  for
        the Tribunal.

Submissions on behalf of HKA and AE-S

    71. Ms Harrison relied  on  her  skeleton  argument  and  endorsed  the
        submissions made on behalf of the other appellants.  HKA  and  AE-S
        would need to make arrangements to travel from Tripoli to Benghazi.
        The evidence is that Benghazi is worse in terms  of  security  than
        Tripoli. We were referred to the report of Dr Porter at [42] and at
        [45] in relation to checkpoints and how easy or otherwise it is  to
        navigate through them.

    72. These two appellants without contacts going into  a  new  territory
        may be asked for a bribe and  detentions  are  arbitrary  with  the
        situation at checkpoints being  extremely  unpredictable.  Although
        HKA would  be  returned  with  her  brother,  there  is  background
        evidence in the consolidated bundle at page 233 of  two  women  who
        were with a male chaperone  being  arbitrarily  detained,  although
        they were then released.

    73. It may be necessary to distinguish between a lone  female  and  one
        accompanied, as explained in Dr Porter's report  at  [67].  In  his
        oral evidence he said that a single woman trying to  rent  property
        or  to  reserve  a  hotel  room  could  be  suspected  of  being  a
        prostitute. We were reminded of his oral evidence  in  relation  to
        the potential problems faced by women moving from place  to  place,
        although he said that it would not necessarily be dangerous  for  a
        female travelling alone.

    74. HKA had given details in her witness statement of her family,  that
        information being consistent with the screening interview. There is
        no evidence as to whether she  has  a  family  book,  although  she
        travelled with her passport which  it  was  said  is  part  of  the
        compendium of information in the family book.

    75. In relation to Article 15(c), Ms Harrison adopted the same position
        as the representatives for the other appellants.

Further submissions on behalf of the respondent

    76. We sought clarification from Mr Palmer in relation  to  whether  it
        could be said that there are "Actors of Protection" in Libya,  with
        reference to  the  Refugee  or  Person  in  Need  of  International
        Protection Regulations 2006 ("the  2006  Regulations").  Mr  Palmer
        referred to reg. 4(2) submitting that it was not necessary for each
        of the matters set out there to be in  place  before  it  could  be
        found that protection can be provided. The question is one of fact.
        We were referred to the  decisions  in  Horvath  and  Bagdanavicius
        which emphasise practicality and effectiveness. It was not accepted
        that reg. 4(2) establishes a set of legal hurdles.

    77. In these appeals it is not submitted on behalf  of  the  respondent
        that the question of the effectiveness of protection is dispositive
        of the outcomes,  neither  have  the  appellants.  Their  arguments
        relate to risk categories. It was not, however, suggested that  the
        same militias who present a risk to an individual could provide the
        protection to that person.

    78. In other cases, for example a  blood  feud,  the  question  of  how
        effective the protection of the militias would be was  not  put  to
        the experts and no evidence was advanced on the issue.

    79. Even if reg. 4(2) does set out legal requirements that must be met,
        on the facts here they would be. Militias have taken over  policing
        and there is some form of a judicial system, albeit not national in
        effect. It was accepted that  on  a  national  basis  there  is  no
        judicial oversight of the militias. There are some courts operating
        Dr George said, although again not on a nationwide basis. The issue
        as to in what areas that is the case was not explored in evidence.

Further submissions on behalf of AT

    80. Mr Ficklin  submitted  that  reg.  4(2)  did  establish  a  set  of
        requirements that had to be met. He relied on the decision  of  the
        European Court of Justice in Abdullah C-175/08 [2010] ALL  ER  (EC)
        799. Although  it  is  true  that  the  militias  have  been  'sub-
        contracted' it is relevant for example to take  into  account  that
        detention centres nominally under the control of the government  do
        not conform to any national standards. The same is true in relation
        to policing. There would in that  case  be  a  flagrant  breach  of
        Article 6 of the ECHR.

                           THE BACKGROUND EVIDENCE

     1. Although some aspects of the background evidence  are  more  easily
        categorised as relating to a discrete issue than  others,  we  have
        sought to avoid an artificial separation of the background evidence
        by category. The fact that we have  summarised  the  evidence  with
        reference to broad  categories  does  not  suggest  that  any  such
        category is  to  be  isolated  from  contributing  to  the  overall
        landscape of assessment. Our summary has regard to the issues  that
        are to be determined in these appeals.

   General assessment

     2. The Country of Origin Information report ("COI") dated 19  December
        2012,  at 4.01, quoting The Encyclopaedia Britannica in its chapter
         "Libya Revolt of  2011"  states  that  the  National  Transitional
        Council ("TNC") struggled to establish a functional government  and
        exert its authority in the months following the fall of the Qadhafi
        regime. The report refers at 4.02 to the elections  of  July  2012.
        According to the Secretary  General's  Special  Representative  and
        head of the  UN  Support  Mission  in  Libya  ("UNSMIL"),  election
        observers from the African Union, the European Union and the Carter
        Centre had made positive preliminary  statements  praising  Libya's
        High Election Commission, for its transparency and  flexibility  in
        the face of security threats in Eastern parts of  the  country.  At
        4.04 an article from The Economist is quoted as  referring  to  the
        relative failure of the Islamists in  the  election.  At  4.05  the
        handover of power from the NTC to  the  General  National  Congress
        ("GNC") on 8 August 2012 is described.

     3. Ali Zidan was elected  as  Prime  Minister  in  October  2012,  the
        previous prime minister having been dismissed a  week  earlier  for
        failing to form a government. There were protests against  some  of
        the ministerial nominations who are said to have had links with the
        former regime. The Libyan national assembly building was stormed by
        protestors, the events "being a reminder of  the  volatility  still
        plaguing Libya" a year after the fall of Qadhafi,  according  to  a
        Reuters report dated 1 November 2012 (COI 4.06-4.07).

     4. At 4.08, a Libya Herald article dated 16 November 2011  is  quoted,
        noting that several  ministers  had  been  disbarred  from  holding
        public office by the Integrity Commission. The process  of  vetting
        is said to have been condemned by Human Rights Watch. There follows
        a long list of categories  of  those  banned  from  holding  public
        office on account of various activities  or  enrichment  under  the
        previous regime.

     5. At 4.09 there is a  description  of  attacks  on  Sufi  shrines  by
        Salafists in September 2012 and previous weeks,  with  neither  the
        Ministry of the Interior nor the police  intervening.  The  article
        from The Economist suggests that this may indicate the influence of
        the extreme Islamists or the weakness of  the  government  and  its
        security forces. The same article describes a disquieting aspect of
        the new Libya being the ability of local militias,  especially  in,
        for  example  Misrata  and  Zintan,  to  ignore  the  writ  of  the
        government. Tribal and ethnic  tensions  for  example  in  southern
        cities such  as  Sebha  and  Kufra  continue  to  provoke  periodic
        outbreaks of violence.

     6. The attack on the US Consulate in Benghazi in September 2012 killed
        the US ambassador and three other Americans. The extract from a BBC
        news report states that the US believes that Islamist armed  groups
        used a protest against a film produced in the US as cover  for  the
        attack and a Telegraph article describes the  possible  involvement
        of Al-Qaeda (4.10-4.11).

     7. At 4.12-4.13 the UN news service and  Human  Rights  Watch  ("HRW")
        reports on fighting in Bani Walid in September and October 2012 are
        referred to. The former refers to "growing civilian casualties  due
        to indiscriminate shelling". Libyan army forces are  said  to  have
        launched a full scale assault against  the  town,  accusing  it  of
        being controlled by Qadhafi supporters.  The  small  city  of  Bani
        Walid is said to have been one of the last to fall to rebel  groups
        and to be a centre for regime loyalists  and  criminal  gangs.  HRW
        reported  that  the  number  of  victims  from  the  fighting  "and
        indiscriminate shelling" remained unclear. Doctors at the  hospital
        said that at least seven people not associated with any armed group
        had been killed and 60 wounded. "That number"  rose  as  the  major
        assault by attacking forces began on October 18 with  thousands  of
        residents fleeing. The Libyan official news agency reported that at
        least 22 people had been killed.

     8. The HRW report describes  Bani  Walid  as  being  home  to  Libya's
        largest tribe, the Warfalla with many considering the town as  pro-
        Qadhafi. One militia from the Warfalla fought against  Qadhafi  and
        in 1993 a group of Warfalla were among those who  staged  a  failed
        coup against Qadhafi. The officials in Bani Walid  have  said  that
        they are loyal to the new government but refused to surrender those
        wanted for crimes before or during the 2011  conflict  until  Libya
        has a functioning judicial system and  hundreds  of  Warfalla  held
        without charge are released from detention, especially in  Misrata.



     9. The US State  Department  report  for  2012  dated  19  April  2013
        ("USSDR") reports that some  human  rights  abuses  continued  most
        frequently where the elected government did not  control  militias.
        The government lacked the capacity and  basic  legal  framework  to
        protect civil and judicial rights fully. With regard to the  courts
        there is a lack of enforcement capability, lack of  competency  and
        confusion over the applicability of the old and new laws. The  most
        significant human rights problems  resulted  from  the  absence  of
        effective justice and security  institutions.  The  new  government
        fell short of establishing a consistent rule of law.

    10. The USSDR continues that:

             "Other important human rights abuses  included:  arbitrary  and
             unlawful killings, including politically motivated killings  by
             groups outside government  control;  kidnappings;  torture  and
             other cruel, inhuman, or  degrading  treatment  or  punishment;
             harsh and life-threatening conditions in detention  and  prison
             facilities, some of which were illegal;  arbitrary  arrest  and
             detention; lengthy pretrial detention; denial  of  fair  public
             trial; an ineffective judicial system  staffed  by  intimidated
             judicial authorities; arbitrary interference with  privacy  and
             home; use of excessive  force  and  other  abuses  in  internal
             conflicts;  localized  restrictions  on  humanitarian  aid   to
             civilians;  limits  on  the  freedoms  of  speech  and   press,
             including violence and harassment  of  journalists  on  several
             occasions and in certain  areas;  restrictions  on  freedom  of
             religion;  abuses  of  internally  displaced  persons   (IDPs),
             refugees,  and  migrants;  social  discrimination  against  and
             societal abuse of  women  and  ethnic  and  racial  minorities,
             including foreign  workers;  legal  and  social  discrimination
             based on sexual orientation; trafficking in  persons;  killings
             related to societal violence; and breaches of labor  rights  in
             practice, including forced labor."

    11. Further, in relation to accountability, the  effectiveness  of  the
        judiciary and security it is stated that:

     "Impunity was a serious problem.  Although  militias  detained  abusive
             Qadhafi-era officials, the scarcely functioning criminal courts
             struggled to try them, and when they  did  attempt  to  conduct
             trials, judges often faced threats of  violence.  In  the  same
             vein, with the judiciary not fully functioning, the  government
             had  not  taken  concrete  steps  by  year's  end  to   advance
             transitional justice.  There  were  rarely  investigations  and
             still fewer prosecutions of those believed  to  have  committed
             abuses.

     With the disappearance of the authoritarian  Qadhafi  regime,  militias
             that spearheaded his overthrow filled a security vacuum in many
             parts of the  country.  During  the  year  militias  and  their
             supporters--at times nominally but not fully under the  control
             of the interim and later the elected  government's  authority--
             violated  human  rights  and  humanitarian  norms,   committing
             unlawful  killings,  physical  violence,  and   other   abuses.
             Hostility to real and perceived Qadhafi loyalists permeated the
             country,  the  principal  targets  of  which  were  actual   or
             suspected    former    Qadhafi    soldiers    or    supporters.
             Nongovernmental actors, including autonomous militias and armed
             tribal groups, committed human rights  abuses.  Disappearances,
             illegal detentions, and imprisonment of  persons  on  political
             grounds  occurred,  as  did  looting  and   further   violence.
             Vulnerable civilian populations,  including  ethnic  minorities
             and migrants, faced ongoing violence and discrimination."

    12. Particular targets of arbitrary and unlawful killings were real  or
        suspected  Qadhafi  supporters,  Qadhafi  soldiers,  possible  sub-
        Saharan mercenaries, dark-skinned Libyans, former  members  of  the
        security forces, as well as foreign diplomats.

    13. Page 3 of the USSDR reports that there were at least 21 killings in
        Benghazi alone of current and former security  officials,  many  of
        them defectors from the Qadhafi regime.

   Militias/detentions

    14. An example of the human rights abuses that are said  to  have  been
        committed by militias is that reported by the UN Support Mission in
        Libya, at page 5 of the USSDR: three detainees died on 13 April  as
        a direct result of torture, and at least seven other  persons  were
        tortured in the Zaroug detention facility in Misrata.  The  Supreme
        Security Committee ("SSC") which  was  under  the  control  of  the
        Ministry of  the  Interior,  controlled  the  facility.  The  USSDR
        continues that:

             "Treatment varied from facility to facility and  was  typically
             worst at the time of arrest. Reported abuses included  beatings
             with  belts,  sticks,  rifles,  and  hoses;  administration  of
             electric shocks;  burns  inflicted  by  boiling  water,  heated
             metal, or cigarettes; mock executions;  suspension  from  metal
             bars; and rape. Abuses against detainees, particularly  alleged
             Qadhafi  loyalists  and  sub-Saharan  Africans   aligned   with
             Qadhafi,  were  similarly   reported   at   other   militia-run
             facilities throughout the country."

    15. According to  a  report  by  the  UN  Secretary  General's  special
        representative for Libya, on 10 May 2012 there  were  approximately
        3,000  people  held  in  31   Justice   Ministry   facilities   and
        approximately 4,000 held by various militia  groups  at  formal  or
        secret detention facilities. At year's end the ICRC estimated  that
        several  thousand  persons  remained  detained  with  the  greatest
        concentration of detainees being in greater  Tripoli,  Misrata  and
        Benghazi. The vast majority were Libyans accused  of  fighting  for
        the Qadhafi regime. The other main category was foreigners of which
        a majority appeared to be irregular migrants.

    16. As to the types of informal detention facility and  the  conditions
        within them:

             "makeshift  facilities  appeared  throughout  the  country   to
             accommodate detainees collected by all sides. These facilities'
             conditions  were  uneven  and  varied  widely,  but  consistent
             problems included overcrowding, poor ventilation, the  lack  of
             necessities such as mattresses, and poor access to hygiene  and
             health care. Militias reportedly detained persons  at  schools,
             former government military sites, and  other  informal  venues,
             including private homes and, in one case, a soccer  club.  Many
             prisons  and  detention  centers  were   outside   of   central
             government control, and the  conditions  in  some  prisons  and
             detention centers  were  harsh  to  the  point  of  being  life
             threatening. Access to food in Ministry of Justice prisons  was
             generally adequate, although access  to  potable  water  was  a
             critical  problem  in  Joodayem,  Salah  Aldeen,  and   Dafniya
             prisons.

             Men  and  women  were  reportedly  held  separately.  In   some
             instances minors were held in Ministry of Justice prisons  with
             adults. Human rights organizations reported that militias  also
             held minors with adults.

             Administration: Information about the administration of prisons
             and detention centers was generally not available  due  to  the
             lack of government control and improvised solutions  that  were
             required to accommodate the large increase of detainees in  the
             course of the revolution. There was no information on  adequacy
             of recordkeeping, alternative sentencing practices,  permission
             for religious  observances,  investigation  of  allegations  of
             inhumane conditions,  or  access  to  visitors.  There  was  no
             credible ombudsman for prisoners and detainees."

    17. On page 15 of the USSDR, in relation  to  freedom  of  movement  it
        states that on 16 December 2012 the GNC voted to  declare  much  of
        the southern part of the country a "closed military zone". With the
        ending of the conflict some militias and government forces  imposed
        barriers to movement  by  setting  up  checkpoints  in  areas  that
        remained strongholds for Qadhafi loyalists,  such  as  Bani  Walid,
        Sirte, Tawargha and other locations.

    18. The Report of the Secretary-General on the United  Nations  Support
        Mission in Libya dated 5 September 2013 refers  at  para  20  to  a
        decision by the GNC in March 2013  instructing  the  Ministries  of
        Defence and Interior to remove from Tripoli all "illegitimate armed
        formations", and ensure transfer to the army of  all  illegal  arms
        and military equipment in the city. "Notwithstanding  broad  public
        support for the decision, its implementation has proven to be quite
        difficult, partly owing to the conflicting political  and  regional
        agendas on the part of the various brigades."

    19. At para 21 there is reference to clashes  between  Zintan  brigades
        affiliated with the Ministry of Defence and others affiliated  with
        Tripoli's Supreme Security Committee. The two-day clashes  left  at
        least 10 dead, and on 27 June, the Minister of Defence, Mohammad al-
        Bargathi, was dismissed. "The restoration of a fragile calm to  the
        city's streets was interrupted by the remote detonation of four car
        bombs on 16 July."

    20. With reference to eastern Libya, the report states at para 23  that
        Benghazi and  other  parts  of  eastern  Libya  witnessed  mounting
        opposition to the revolutionary brigades, especially those referred
        to as Libya Shield. A demonstration outside  the  barracks  of  one
        such brigade resulted in an exchange of fire between protestors and
        the brigade, resulting in 30 people being killed.  It  goes  on  to
        refer at para 26 to  "a  discernible  campaign"  of  assassinations
        targeting members of the security forces in eastern Libya.

    21. The security situation in southern Libya is said in the  report  to
        remain mostly fragile despite government efforts. There was a spate
        of security incidents including armed attacks on 30  March  on  the
        security directorate in Sabha and a military base in the region and
        three car bombs in downtown Sabha on  26  June  resulting  in  four
        deaths.

    22. Para 38 suggests that  the  overall  number  of  "conflict-related"
        detainees remains at around 8,000, the majority of whom are held in
        facilities nominally under  the  authority  of  the  ministries  of
        justice and defence. There was no significant  advancement  in  the
        judicial screening of detainees,  partly  because  of  the  limited
        enforcement power of the prosecutors and their  reluctance  to  act
        through fear of reprisal. The safety of judicial personnel remained
        a serious concern, with several attacks on judges  and  prosecutors
        recorded.  A  high-level  judge  was   assassinated   outside   the
        courthouse in Derna on 16 June  and  there  were  bomb  attacks  on
        courthouses in Sirte and Benghazi in July.

    23. The  treatment  of  detainees  remained  a  serious  concern,  with
        evidence  of  torture  and  other  forms  of   ill-treatment,   and
        conditions of detention in a number of facilities, especially those
        holding illegal migrants under the authority of the Ministry of the
        Interior remained unacceptable.

    24. Regarding the judiciary and prisons, at para 45 it is  stated  that
        except for senior members of the Qadhafi regime, the resumption  of
        criminal trials remains slow, owing to security problems.  Para  47
        refers to prison breaks, including the escape of 1,400 inmates from
        a prison in Benghazi following a riot.

    25. The OGN for May 2013,  states at  3.13.14  in  relation  to  prison
        conditions that:
             "Prison and detention centre conditions in Libya are very poor;
             overcrowding,  lengthy  pre-trial  incarceration,  torture  and
             deaths  in  custody  are  particular   problems.   The   Libyan
             authorities have yet to gain authority  over  the  hundreds  of
             militias currently holding several thousand  detainees  outside
             any legal jurisdiction."

    26. At 3.13.15 it states that:

             "There is evidence of security personnel and members of militia
             groups  acting  with  impunity  with  regard  to  inhuman   and
             degrading treatment. Reports indicate that those  perceived  to
             have been pro-Gaddafi loyalists, and those  perceived  to  have
             been working or fighting on his behalf, particularly  those  of
             African ethnicity are at particular risk of ill  treatment.  In
             such cases the risk of mistreatment will be sufficient to  make
             removal a breach of Article 3."

    27.  Finally,  it  is  said  at  3.13.16  that  where  applicants   can
        demonstrate a real risk of imprisonment on return to Libya, a grant
        of Humanitarian Protection is likely to be appropriate, going on to
        conclude as follows:

             "However,  the  individual  factors  of  each  case  should  be
             considered  to  determine  whether  detention  will   cause   a
             particular individual in his particular circumstances to suffer
             treatment contrary to Article 3. Relevant factors  include  the
             likely type of detention facility, the reasons  for  detention,
             with particular regard to the individual's  political  profile,
             and the  individual's  age,  gender,  ethnicity  and  state  of
             health."

    28. In its summary of the report "Torture and deaths  in  detention  in
        Libya" the United Nations  Support  Mission  in  Libya  ("UNSMIL"),
        dated October 2013, states that:

             "Torture and other ill-treatment in Libya is  an  on-going  and
             widespread concern  in  many  detention  centres,  despite  the
             efforts of the Libyan authorities which are  committed  at  the
             highest level to ending torture  and  to  ensuring  the  proper
             functioning of the criminal justice system."

    29. Since 2012, the report states, the government has sought  to  bring
        under the authority of the state the armed brigades  which  are  in
        control of most of the detention  facilities  where  torture  takes
        place. In April 2013 Libya adopted  a  law  criminalising  torture,
        enforced disappearance and discrimination. A new law  in  September
        2013 requires all conflict-related  detainees  to  be  released  or
        referred  to  the  public  prosecutor  within  90   days   of   the
        promulgation of the law. Nevertheless the  report  states,  torture
        continues and is most frequent immediately on arrest and during the
        first days of interrogation as a means to  extract  confessions  or
        other information. Detainees are usually held  "without  access  to
        lawyers and occasional  access  to  families,  if  any."  The  vast
        majority of the estimated 8,000 conflict-related detainees are held
        without due process.

    30. From late 2011 UNSMIL has recorded 27 deaths in custody where there
        is significant information to suggest that torture was  the  cause.
        There are other cases which it has not been  able  to  investigate.
        Eleven of the 27 cases took place  in  2013  in  detention  centres
        under the nominal authority  of  the  Government,  but  effectively
        under the control of armed brigades.

    31. As to the number of conflict-related detainees, on page  4  of  the
        report it is said that the 8,000 estimate  is  a  figure  that  has
        remained fairly constant since the declaration of the liberation in
        October 2011.  Accurate  figures,  including  in  relation  to  the
        detaining agency, are not available. The report describes at  pages
        4-5 the  range  of  detention  facilities,  from  those  under  the
        authority  of  the  state,  specifically  the  Judicial  Police  or
        Military Police, for example  prisons,  those  fully  or  partially
        under the  authority  of  armed  brigades  brought  within  various
        government ministries, to those run entirely by armed brigades with
        no formal connection to any State institution and no control by the
        government.

    32. Vetting of brigade members integrated in State institutions such as
        the Judicial or Military Police has been minimal or non-existent.

    33. On page  6  it  states  that  those  arrested  include  individuals
        suspected of having fought on the side of or  of  having  supported
        Qadhafi's regime,  "and  their  family  members".  Some  have  been
        detained apparently on the basis of belonging to certain tribal  or
        ethnic groups, including Warfalla, Tawurga and Mashashiya "as these
        groups are collectively perceived by some as having  supported  the
        former regime". It goes on to state that given the arbitrary nature
        of the arrests and lack of judicial oversight  "cases  of  personal
        score-settling are not uncommon".

    34. The Ministry of Justice reported in  September  2013  that  of  the
        estimated 8,000 conflict-related detainees,  4,000  are  under  the
        custody of the Judicial Police, with the remainder  being  held  by
        the Military Police under the Ministry of Defence, by the  SSC  and
        the Combating Crime Department (composed mostly of  armed  brigades
        operating under the Ministry of the Interior) and by armed brigades
        not affiliated to any Ministry. Around  2,700  are  in  some  seven
        detention facilities in Misrata.

    35. As to the number of detention facilities, reliable figures are  not
        available, although  there  are  37  under  the  authority  of  the
        Ministry of Justice as at September 2013.

    36.  A report in the Libya Herald dated 13 September 2013 describes SSC
        commander, Abdel Rauf Kara, as estimating that he has some 700  men
        under his command at his base at Mitiga airbase. There are seven or
        eight units and their numbers can be swelled to  around  10,000  if
        reserves are called in. He stated that the members of the SSC  come
        not only from Souq Al-Juma'a but from all over Tripoli, and outside
        Tripoli. The report describes  him  as  the  most  powerful  thuwar
        leader in the capital after Hashim Bashir,  the  commander  of  the
        city's SSC.

    37. Kara is reported as stating that there  is  no  trust  between  the
        thuwar (who make up the SSC) and  the  government  because  of  the
        latter's tendency  to  appoint  persons  associated  with  the  old
        regime. That the thuwar have not en masse joined the police or  the
        army is because the government is considered suspect.

    38. Kara is also reported as having stated that  he  does  not  condemn
        everyone who worked for the Qadhafi regime, stating that they  have
        relatives and friends who used to work in  it  but  they  were  not
        involved in any bloodshed, or  did  not  steal  any  public  money.
        Whether they are affiliated with the Interior Ministry or the army,
        all  SSC  units  are  paid  by  the  government,  and   all   other
        expenditures are met by donations, stating that people donate money
        to them "to  maintain  security  and  to  provide  protection."  He
        accepted that on occasions he acted independently of the Ministries
        because sometimes he has to take decisions when  "no  one  will  be
        willing to instruct you" in relation to taking  responsibility  for
        protecting people and institutions.

    39. In a further Libyan Herald report of 10 June 2013 he is  quoted  as
        accepting that the SSC  when  created  did  include  drug  dealers,
        smugglers and former prisoners under Qadhafi, and that some  people
        who perpetrate crimes are also  members  of  the  SSC:  "You  would
        consider the SSC as a mix of sheikhs, students and  graduates  from
        prison!". He  stated,  however,  that  it  played  a  key  role  in
        providing security in the capital.

    40. A report by Amnesty International ("AI") dated July  2012  entitled
        "Libya: Rule of Law or Rule of Militias" (and based on a  visit  to
        Libya in May and June  2012)  describes  in  its  introduction  the
        detention and torture of two women aged 27 and 32 by militia  at  a
        checkpoint in February  2012,  accused  of  supporting  the  former
        regime. In describing the abuses committed by militias  the  report
        states that they recklessly use  machine-guns,  mortars  and  other
        weapons  during  tribal  and  territorial  conflicts  "killing  and
        maiming bystanders". It continues, stating that  militias  continue
        to seize people albeit on a significantly reduced scale.

    41. The report in its introduction states that  UNSMIL  estimated  that
        about 4,000 people were held outside of government control  in  mid
        May 2012, but "recent" estimates in the report are said to put  the
        number at about 7,000. The transitional government is said to  have
        made some progress in bringing prisons under the oversight  of  the
        relevant ministries. Treatment in places of detention  is  said  in
        the report to  improve  for  longer  term  detainees  although  new
        arrivals continue  to  suffer  abuse.  Detainees  are  particularly
        vulnerable to revenge beatings  and  vigilante-style  justice  when
        held by victims or relatives of victims of human rights  violations
        by Qadhafi forces or when  held  in  cities  where  they  allegedly
        committed the violations.

    42. Progress in charging detainees with recognisable criminal  offences
        is said to have been extremely slow, with some detainees being held
        for  a  year  without  charge.  With  rare  exceptions   they   are
        interrogated without lawyers. To AI's knowledge, by early June 2012
        only three trials had begun  in  civilian  courts  in  relation  to
        crimes committed in the context of the conflict.

    43. On page 10 of this AI report it refers to public criticism  of  the
        revolutionaries being uncommon. Outspoken individuals faced threats
        and  intimidation  "entrenching  the  climate  of  self-censorship"
        (quoted in the OGN at 3.10.6).

    44. In a  report  by  Amnesty  International  ("AI")  dated  July  2012
        entitled "Libya: Rule of Law or Rule of Militias" (and based  on  a
        visit to Libya in May and June  2012)  reference  is  made  to  the
        Tawurga and the estimated population of about  30,000  having  been
        driven out by Misrata  militias,  those  former  inhabitants  being
        scattered across Libya, including  in  poorly  resourced  camps  in
        Tripoli and Benghazi. The Mashashiya community from  the  areas  of
        Awaniya, Zawiyat al-Bajoul and Omer in the  Nafousa  Mountains  are
        said in the report to face a similar plight at the hands of  Zintan
        militias. Not only are such communities  barred  from  going  home,
        they also face arbitrary arrest and other reprisals.

    45. Foreign nationals "in an irregular situation",  particularly  those
        from sub-Saharan Africa are  said  to  remain  at  risk  of  abuse.
        Although they are no longer being arrested  on  a  large  scale  on
        suspicion of  being  foreign  mercenaries,  they  are  still  being
        routinely rounded up from their homes, or seized at checkpoints  or
        from the streets by armed militias. Their crime is to have  entered
        the country illegally. They  are  held  indefinitely  in  detention
        facilities under the control of militias in poor conditions without
        any possibility of challenging the  legality  of  their  detention.
        Some have complained  of  beatings,  in  some  cases  amounting  to
        torture. Further on at section 3 the report refers to  both  recent
        arrivals and those who have lived in Libya  for  many  years  being
        seized, and including both men and women.

    46. Tensions and fighting in the remote south-eastern city of Kufra are
        described from page 47 of the report. The city is home to  a  black
        minority community, the Tabu, who are  also  present  elsewhere  in
        Libya as well as in Chad and Niger. Animosities  between  the  Tabu
        and the majority Arab Zwaii tribe predate the 2011 uprising against
        Qadhafi. The Tabu  complained  about  discriminatory  policies  and
        practice during the Qadhafi era. The majority  Arab  population  of
        Kufra complained  about  the  involvement  of  non-Libyan  Tabu  in
        violence and other lawless  behaviour.  Tabus  joined  anti-Qadhafi
        forces during the uprising. A local Tabu leader briefly  served  as
        Kufra's representative on the NTC before resigning in October  2011
        in protest against what he said was continued  marginalisation  and
        discrimination against the Tabu.

    47. Kufra's residents are said to have borne the brunt of the resulting
        armed confrontations, which  also  included  Libya  Shield  forces.
        Among those killed were individuals not involved in  the  fighting,
        including women, children and unarmed men. Both sides are  said  to
        have fired recklessly and inherently indiscriminate weapons such as
        mortars are said to have been used. There has been displacement  of
        families from both groups as a result  of  the  fighting  and  both
        sides seized captives who  were  ill-treated.  A  short  report  in
        Maghrebia.com refers to further conflict in Kufra in June 2012.

    48. In Sabha tensions between Arab and Tabu  communities  also  led  to
        violence in late March 2012. Bystanders and  the  local  population
        were affected. The violence is said to have  lasted  six  days  and
        left 81 people dead. Tabu students  at  Sabha  University  reported
        that they had been  harassed  by  Arab  militia,  had  their  rooms
        raided, their belongings taken, and were detained and  tortured.  A
        number of individual examples are described. An  AI  report  of  23
        April 2012 refers to 150 deaths and 350 injured.

    49. Tabu militias are said to have been responsible for the  deaths  of
        civilians, arbitrary arrests and torture  when  they  attacked  the
        city of Traghen, about 120 km from Sabha  in  October  2011.  There
        were claims that remnants of the Qadhafi government were in  hiding
        there.

    50. Conflict in Bani Walid is the subject of an AI report dated October
        2012. The GNC had authorised the Ministries of Interior and Defence
        to use force to arrest suspects, including those said to have  been
        responsible for the alleged torture and  killing  of  the  Misratan
        Omran Shaaban, one of those credited with having  captured  Colonel
        Qadhafi on 20 October 2011. Since then members of the Libyan  army,
        Libya Shield forces and militias from around the country  including
        Misrata, had surrounded Bani Walid  and  clashes  occurred  on  the
        outskirts of the city. Three residents of the city are said to have
        been killed. There are said to  have  been  long-standing  tensions
        between Bani Walid and Misrata.

    51. A BBC news report dated 9 June 2013 refers to  the  resignation  of
        the Libyan army Chief of Staff after  30  people  died  in  clashes
        between protestors and militia in Benghazi. Protestors had gathered
        outside the Libya Shield  Brigade's  premises,  demanding  that  it
        disband. Tens of thousands are said to have taken to the streets in
        2012 in Benghazi to eject a number of armed groups that were blamed
        for continuing lawlessness in the city.

    52. Al Jazeera reported on 25 August 2013 on clashes in Zawiye  between
        members of the Wershifana tribal group and residents of  the  town.
        Four people are said to have been killed and several wounded.

    53. On 8 November  2013  Reuters  reported  on  clashes  between  rival
        militias in Tripoli, in which anti-aircraft guns and grenades  were
        used. At least one person is  said  to  have  been  killed  and  12
        wounded, although al-Arabiya television reported two killed and  21
        wounded.  The gunfire is said to have  caused  diners  to  run  for
        cover and  drivers  to  abandon  their  cars.   Guests  in  one  of
        Tripoli's best hotels,  the  Radisson  Blu,  were  evacuated  after
        windows in the reception area were broken by stray gunfire.

    54. A Reuters report dated 8 November 2013 refers to fighting by  rival
        militias in Tripoli describing it as a four hour battle with  anti-
        aircraft guns and grenades, and as "the worst fighting  for  months
        in the Libyan capital". At least  one  person  was  killed  and  12
        wounded. It is said to have been  the  second  outbreak  of  street
        fighting within days.

   Particular ethnic groups, dark-skinned Libyans and Sub-Saharan Africans

    55. The USSDR  report  states  that  although  significant  numbers  of
        Libyans had returned to their places of origin,  there  were  still
        65,000 IDP's. Most Tawurgans had not returned to Tawurga by the end
        of 2012. Return of the inhabitants is impossible without systematic
        reconstruction  and  security  efforts.  There  was  no   effective
        government programme to assist IDP's or facilitate their return and
        their needs were largely  met  through  international  humanitarian
        assistance. IDP's were vulnerable to abuses, such as armed attacks,
        arbitrary detention, trafficking, forced labour,  and  gender-based
        violence, from militia forces or other armed groups not  under  the
        control of the transitional governments.

    56. IDP's from tribes and cities known  to  be  loyal  to  the  Qadhafi
        government,  including  the  Tawurga,  Qawalish,  and   Mashashiya,
        additionally  faced   harassment,   violence,   intimidation,   and
        discrimination. Militias in Misrata arbitrarily  detained  hundreds
        of Tawarghan IDP's, including women and children,  and  transferred
        them to detention in nearby  Misrata,  where  human  rights  groups
        reported serious mistreatment  and  torture.  Dark-skinned  Libyans
        were particularly vulnerable to harassment  and  abuse  by  militia
        forces.

    57. Concerning the protection of refugees and  access  to  asylum,  the
        report on page 17 states that while the flow of persons across  the
        border continued throughout the conflict, there were  reports  that
        hundreds to thousands of sub-Saharan Africans entered  the  country
        illegally, aided by the porous nature  of  the  country's  southern
        borders. Treatment of  migrants  depended  upon  their  country  of
        origin and the offence for which they were being  held  (some  were
        held for having improper documents and others for having  committed
        other crimes). There was no  consistent  protocol  for  determining
        whether foreigners were to be sent to migrant detention  facilities
        or  to  criminal  detention  facilities.  The  waiting   time   for
        deportation  to  home  countries  was  also   uneven,   with   some
        individuals returned after three months and others waiting  a  year
        or more.

    58. On page 17 of the USSDR it states  that  detention  of  sub-Saharan
        African refugees and migrants  increased  significantly  after  the
        fall of the Qadhafi government, when revolutionary forces  detained
        thousands of sub-Saharan Africans on suspicion that they  supported
        the Qadhafi regime or were complicit in abuses during the conflict.
        While the interim governments and affiliated militias  subsequently
        released several  thousand  detainees,  estimates  of  sub-Saharans
        detained in scattered detention sites at the  end  of  2012  ranged
        from 1,500 to 2,500. The UNHCR,  ICRC,  International  Organization
        for Migration (IOM), HRW, and  other  organizations  were  able  to
        access many detention sites and informal detention  facilities  run
        by militias to provide basic assistance, including  sanitation  and
        health care, refugee registration, and counselling. Most  detainees
        were not officially  charged  and  had  no  access  to  review  and
        judicial processes. Those with  potential  refugee  claims  had  no
        access to refugee status determination procedures.

    59. On page 24 of the USSDR it states that:

             "There was societal discrimination and violence originating  in
             ethnic differences. Racial discrimination existed against dark-
             skinned Libyans,  including  those  of  originally  sub-Saharan
             descent, in part due to allegations that Qadhafi  used  African
             mercenaries during the conflict. There were  reports  of  dark-
             skinned Libyans as well as Tuaregs  being  removed  from  their
             homes in Tripoli and held in detention centers and prisons.

             There was also societal discrimination and violence originating
             in attitudes toward the previous regime. For example,  fighting
             began April 1, reportedly involving heavy weapons, between  the
             largely Amazigh and anti-Qadhafi western town of Zuwara, on one
             side, and the mostly Arab and pro-Qadhafi  towns  of  Al-Jimail
             and Regdalin on the other.

             There were also clashes reflecting a conflict between Tebou and
             Zway tribes over smuggling rivalries in the  southeast  of  the
             country.  On  March  26,  Arab  government-affiliated   militia
             clashed with Tebou tribal groups  in  the  region  near  Kufra.
             According to reports from local contacts and NGOs, the fighting
             was  largely  one  sided  and  targeted   at   Tebou   civilian
             neighborhoods in attempt  to  push  Libyan  Tebou  out  of  the
             country into Chad. On April 21, the conflict had  escalated  to
             the point that government forces were sent to Kufra to  restore
             order."

    60. The AI report of 16 February 2012 entitled "Militias Threaten  Hope
        for New Libya" states that a challenge for the  new  regime  is  to
        tackle "the widespread discrimination and xenophobia  against  sub-
        Saharan Africans and dark-skinned Libyans from Tawargha  and  other
        parts of Libya where  support  for  al-Gaddafi  forces  during  the
        conflict was reportedly high." The  forcible  displacement  of  the
        residents of Tawurga is referred to and that  thousands  of  people
        have been evicted or fled  their  homes  in  the  Nafusa  Mountains
        (mainly those from the Mashashiya and Qawalish tribes), as well  as
        in Sirte and Bani Walid "and remain targeted by militias because of
        their alleged support for al-Gadaffi forces during the conflict."

    61. On page 11 (as copied  in  the  bundle)  of  the  same  report,  in
        relation to Tawurgans, it states that:

             "People from the Tawargha area, who are black Libyans, are  at
             particular risk of reprisals and revenge attacks  by  Misratah
             militias, because the area was a base  for  al-Gaddafi  troops
             when they were besieging Misratah and  because  many  Tawargha
             allegedly supported al-Gaddafi forces during the conflict. The
             number  of  Tawargha  people  among  the   detainees   appears
             disproportionately high  and  most  of  those  interviewed  by
             Amnesty International said they  had  been  tortured  or  ill-
             treated."
              And on page 12 in relation to the Mashashiya that:
              "Members of the Mshashiya and from  Qawalish  tribes  in  the
              Nafusa Mountain area have similarly been targeted by militias
              because of their alleged support for al-Gaddafi forces during
              the conflict. People from the Mshashiya  tribe  and  Qawalish
              village are particularly targeted by militias from Zintan."

         In relation to detainees from Sub-Saharan Africa it states that:


              "People from sub-Saharan Africa who  have  been  detained  by
              militias have been particularly vulnerable  to  abuse.  While
              many Sub-Saharan Africans were detained  during  and  in  the
              weeks after the conflict  because  of  the  belief  that  al-
              Gaddafi forces used  African  mercenaries  to  fight  pro-NTC
              forces, many are now being held because  of  their  suspected
              "illegal"   status   or   related   issues.   When    Amnesty
              International delegates visited Ain Zara  Prison  in  January
              2012, about 400  out  of  approximately  900  detainees  were
              foreign nationals, mainly from Sub-Saharan Africa.  According
              to the prison  administration,  about  10  per  cent  of  the
              foreign nationals were accused of having  fought  during  the
              conflict. Several Sub-Saharan Africans interviewed by Amnesty
              International in detention and after release  said  they  had
              been tortured or ill-treated."

    62. Specifically in relation to Zawiye, the same  AI  report  describes
        the town as one that saw violent confrontations between  supporters
        of the uprising and Qadhafi forces and where  revenge  attacks  and
        reprisals by local militia have taken place against those  who  are
        known to have or are  suspected  of  having  supported  the  former
        regime.

    63. The OGN of May 2013 in relation to particular categories of persons
        states that Tawurgans and the Mashashiya are vulnerable  to  arrest
        by the Misrata and Zintan  militias,  as  suspected  supporters  of
        Qadhafi  and  of  having  committed  crimes  during  the   conflict
        (3.10.4). At 3.10.5, referring to Amnesty International reports  it
        states that militias take persons  suspected  of  having  supported
        Qadhafi forces and committed crimes  during  the  conflict  captive
        from the streets or at checkpoints.  Easily  identifiable  targets,
        such as black  Tawurgans  or  Sub-Saharan  African  nationals,  are
        particularly vulnerable to such practices, severely impeding  their
        freedom of movement. Displaced Tawurgans  have  been  subjected  to
        arbitrary arrest and torture in detention.

    64. Paras  3.12.1-3.12.32  consider  ethnic  groups  stating  that  the
        principal minorities were Amazigh, Tuareg and Tebou. Although under
        Qadhafi the Amazigh faced discrimination, including limitations  on
        the use of their language, by the  end  of  2012  they  used  their
        language publicly, publishing journals  and  using  their  language
        Tamazight on public signs and on the  radio.  They  encouraged  the
        government to make Tamazight one of the official languages.

    65.  Racial  discrimination  existed  against   dark-skinned   Libyans,
        including those originally of sub-Saharan descent, in part  due  to
        allegations  that  Qadhafi  used  African  mercenaries  during  the
        conflict. There were reports of dark-skinned  Libyans  as  well  as
        Tuaregs being removed from their  homes  in  Tripoli  and  held  in
        detention centres and prisons.

    66. Allegations that mercenaries were recruited from Chad, Nigeria  and
        Sudan appeared to be heavily exaggerated. Many Africans  worked  in
        civilian jobs. There have been reports of harassment  and  violence
        towards sub-Saharan African migrant workers, by rebel fighters  and
        civilians. HRW reported that  Africans  were  held  in  overcrowded
        cells with appalling hygiene  standards  and  no  access  to  clean
        drinking water. Many sub-Saharan Africans have  been  displaced  by
        the fighting and for fear of reprisals. Many noted with horror  how
        revolutionary brigades had exacted revenge against largely  unarmed
        Mashashiya and Tawurga, two communities  that  had  largely  backed
        Qadhafi in the conflict.

    67.  Thousands  of  non-Arabs,   like   Tuaregs,   have   no   official
        documentation attesting to their citizenship.  The  main  proof  of
        citizenship is the "family booklet" in which  all  members  of  the
        family are listed and which is presented when  applying  for  jobs,
        university, or when taking out a loan from a bank. Tuaregs who have
        been in Libya "for 100 years"  have  managed  to  obtain  a  family
        booklet but those who settled in the country 40  or  50  years  ago
        were denied one and possess neither Libya nor any other citizenship
        (3.12.10).

    68. Many Tawurga have moved to Benghazi,  Tripoli  or  southern  Libya.
        They remain displaced and live in camps  and  with  host  families,
        though some are held  in  detention.  "The  generally  dark-skinned
        Tawurga" were accused by the brigades of siding with Qadhafi and of
        killing and raping residents  of  Misrata  during  the  revolution.
        According to  community  groups,  about  18,000  Tawurgans  are  in
        Benghazi, 13,000 in Tripoli and 7,000 in and around  Sebha  in  the
        south. There are smaller numbers in other places. In  Tripoli  they
        are mostly based in four camps: at the Naval Academy in Janzur, and
        in the al-Fallah  and  Sarraj  neighbourhoods.  Basic  humanitarian
        assistance comes mostly from LibAid, a  Libyan  government  agency.
        Security has improved, with fewer raids by the Misrata militias who
        claim they are searching for wanted men. In January  2012  militias
        from Misrata raided the Janzur camp and  shot  dead  a  man,  three
        women and three children (3.12.15-3.12-16).

    69. At 3.12.17 it states  that  about  1,300  Tawurgans  are  detained,
        missing or dead according  to  HRW  which  also  said  that  crimes
        committed  against  the  Tawurga  may  amount  to  crimes   against
        humanity.

    70. Para 3.12.23 refers to members of the Tebu and  Tuareg  communities
        having  long  complained  about  discrimination,  racism  and   the
        inability to renew identity documents or obtain new ones for  their
        children. Such communities also tend to be among  the  poorest  and
        live in informal settlements with little access to services.

    71. The Tuareg number some 100,000. Some opposed Qadhafi  while  others
        found employment in the regular army. Many Libyans tend to identify
        all Tuareg as regime supporters. At  least  1,500  Tuareg  fighters
        joined Qadhafi's loyalist forces. Sources inside the Libyan city of
        Ghadames told a news  agency  that  the  Tuareg  tribes  have  been
        subjected to ethnic cleansing for the previous eight  months  since
        May 2012, the Ghadames tribe  apparently  being  responsible.  Many
        Tuareg are  said  to  have  been  detained  in  illegal  places  of
        detention in secret locations in inhumane conditions. They are said
        to be being searched for everywhere, including in hospitals, to  be
        killed and tortured.  As  of  January  2013,  2,400  who  had  fled
        Ghadames remained internally displaced in Libya  (3.12.24-3.12.27).



    72. The COI report 2012, from 19.10, quoting a report of the  UN  Human
        Rights Council 'International  Commission  of  Inquiry  on  Libya',
        released on 2 March 2012, describes the targeting of  Tawurgans  by
        the  Misratan  thuwar[7],  and  of  Mashashiya  towns  regarded  as
        loyalist (to Qadhafi) by thuwar from Zintan.  Mashashiya  detainees
        have been tortured, towns looted and property burnt. Those who have
        attempted to return to  their  homes  are  reported  to  have  been
        beaten.

    73. As regards the Tuareg, at 19.19, the report of the UN Human  Rights
        Council 'International Commission of Inquiry on Libya' dated  March
        2012 is quoted as stating that three interviewees indicated that an
        indeterminate  number  of  Tuareg  men  were  recruited  to   fight
        alongside Qadhafi forces.

    74. The Tebu are said in an  article  from  Al-Jazeera  dated  December
        2012, quoted at 19.20 of the COI, now to dominate Libya's  southern
        desert,  guarding  remote  checkpoints,  oil  fields  and   weapons
        stockpiles. Before the revolution against  Qadhafi  they  had  been
        marginalised for decades. Dislike for Qadhafi led the  Libyan  Tebu
        to rise up against  him  whereby  they  provided  crucial  southern
        support to the coastal rebels' fight.

    75. At 19.21-19.22 the section of the COI on "Black Libyans", referring
        to a report of August 2011 states that since the early days of  the
        Libyan uprising there have been reports of organized racist attacks
        on so-called "Black Libyans" and foreign workers,  particularly  in
        rebel-held  areas.  Officials  of  the  UN  High  Commissioner  for
        Refugees related that refugees arriving from eastern Libya  at  the
        Egyptian border reported that armed Libyans  had  been  going  from
        door to door,  forcing  sub-Saharan  Africans  to  leave.  Tens  of
        thousands of refugees arriving at camps in Tunisia and  Egypt  said
        that  they  were  accused  of  being  mercenaries  hired   by   the
        government.

    76. The  HRW  report  dated  20  March  2013  gives  many  examples  of
        detentions, torture and killings of people from Tawurga by  Misrata
        militias, as well as the destruction of Tawurga.

    77.  Various  reports  and  news  articles,  in  particular  from   the
        background bundle in respect of AMH refer  to  historic  racism  in
        Libyan society, as well as discrimination, intimidation,  detention
        and ill-treatment of sub-Saharan Africans and Black or dark skinned
        Libyans. Several of the reports  refer  to  the  claims  that  such
        individuals were Qadhafi mercenaries as being exaggerated.

    78. A report from Amnesty International ("AI") entitled "Scapegoats  of
        Fear", dated June 2013 states in the  opening  paragraph  that  the
        human rights of tens of thousands of foreign  nationals,  including
        asylum seekers, refugees and migrants, continue to be violated. The
        report goes on to state that:



             "In a context of political instability and lawlessness, foreign
             nationals, mainly from sub-Saharan Africa, are at constant risk
             of  exploitation,  arrest  and  indefinite  detention   pending
             deportation.   Those   without   "proper   documentation"   are
             particularly  vulnerable  as  Libyan  legislation  criminalizes
             entering, staying in or leaving Libya irregularly. When Amnesty
             International delegates were in Libya in April  and  May  2013,
             approximately   1,700   detained   asylum-seekers   were   held
             indefinitely  in  poorly  resourced  "holding   centres".   The
             situation  of  asylum-seekers  and   refugees   in   Libya   is
             particularly  precarious  as  Libya  widely  resorts  to  their
             detention in breach of international law and the country  still
             lacks an asylum system and national asylum legislation.

             Libya continues to  be  heavily  reliant  on  foreign  workers,
             especially in the agriculture and construction sectors as  well
             as the services industry. Despite this,  the  authorities  have
             failed to develop a coherent migration policy  to  protect  the
             rights of these  workers  and  regularize  their  status.  Such
             failures mean that abuses against migrant workers  thrive  with
             impunity."

    79. The  report  goes  on  to  state,  however,  that  migration  flows
        following the mass exodus of foreign nationals in  2011  appear  to
        have resumed, and that:



             "Once again, the country is a magnet  destination  for  people,
             particularly sub-Saharan Africans and North African and  Middle
             Eastern nationals, who are looking for  economic  opportunities
             or for  international  protection  as  they  flee  persecution,
             violence and armed conflicts in the region and beyond."


    80. Many thousands are said  to  arrive  every  year  in  the  hope  of
        continuing their journey to Europe. In addition to  the  Department
        of Combating Irregular Migration ("DCIM"),  militias  and  in  some
        cases ordinary citizens motivated by xenophobia and misguided fears
        about diseases, detain foreign nationals on an almost daily  basis,
        driven by what they believe is their  national  duty.  Arrests  are
        said to take place at any place and  at  any  time,  although  most
        often from their homes, at checkpoints or on the  streets.  The  AI
        report describes the conditions  of  detention  as  in  most  cases
        falling short of international standards, and at times amounting to
        cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment.


    81. A  recent  report  dated  14  October  2013  entitled  "Racism  and
        revolution: the plight of black Africans in Libya" by  Equal  Times
        states that the end of the Qadhafi regime opened up huge  divisions
        in Libyan society, stating that in particular the lid was lifted on
        "a fervent  undercurrent  of  racism  which  has  resulted  in  the
        detention, torture and murder of thousands of black Libyans and sub-
        Saharan migrants since 2011." Allegations of black mercenaries from
        countries like Chad, Niger and Mali killing civilians, coupled with
        stories of mass  rape  allegedly  committed  by  the  mainly  black
        inhabitants of Tawurga is said in the report to  have  fuelled  the
        mistreatment of dark-skinned people in recent years.


    82. The report continues that the exact number of  sub-Saharan  African
        refugees, asylum seekers and economic migrants in Libya is unknown.
        However, some reports are said to put the figure at around  18,000.
        In referring to the Libya Shield it says that:

             "A group of former anti-Gaddafi militias who operate  as  a  de
             facto army and police force under the  country's  newly  formed
             Ministry of Defence, one of its responsibilities is  'securing'
             the refugee camps and its residents.

             In reality, this means stopping anyone from leaving, even if it
             means using extreme violence."

       Stories were reported of migrants and refugees  who  had  money  and
       other property stolen by  the  Libya  Shield,  and  that  those  who
       protest are severely beaten and subject to electric shocks.

   Former Qadhafi loyalists

    83. The OGN of May 2013 refers to  targeted  killings  having  occurred
        throughout 2012, particularly of  former  members  of  the  Qadhafi
        intelligence and security  services.  No  investigations  into  the
        killings were announced and no arrests in  respect  of  them  made.
        Very  few  lawyers  are  willing  to  represent   alleged   Qadhafi
        loyalists, either  for  ideological  reasons  or  out  of  fear  of
        reprisals (3.10.9-3.10.11).

    84. The conclusion at 3.10.18 is that:

               "Given  the  generalised  attitude  of   resentment   towards
             perceived Col. Gaddafi supporters and fighters, and  the  force
             with which the Gaddafi regime previously sought to  subdue  the
             opposition, it is likely that applicants in this category  will
             be able to show a need for international protection.  Perceived
             supporters of Gaddafi and his regime  are  at  risk  of  extra-
             judicial execution, arbitrary detention, torture, ill-treatment
             and death in detention, both  by  authorities  of  the  Interim
             Government or  its  armed  affiliates,  as  well  as  by  armed
             militias operating without government control."

    85. Para 3.10.19 goes on to state that consideration should be given to
        the individual's circumstances, including "the nature and degree of
        the perceived relationship to Gaddafi's regime", and that:

             "Where it is accepted that an individual applicant was  closely
             involved  with  Gaddafi  and  the  regime,  or  his  particular
             circumstances indicate a likely risk of attracting the  adverse
             interest of militia brigades allied to the Libyan  authorities,
             a grant of asylum will generally be appropriate, subject to any
             exclusion  considerations  under  Article  1F  of  the  Refugee
             Convention."

    86. The OGN concludes that it is unlikely that such a person  would  be
        able to relocate internally given that the interim government would
        not be able  to  provide  effective  protection,  that  torture  is
        carried out by officially recognised  security  entities  and  that
        persons suspected of having supported Qadhafi's  forces  are  taken
        captive on the streets and at checkpoints.

    87. The Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada report dated 7 December
        2012 in relation to the "Situation and treatment of those perceived
        to be loyal to  Qaddafi  since  his  fall;  state  protection".  It
        refers, inter alia, to various sources which describe detentions of
        Qadhafi loyalists during and after  the  conflict,  their  torture,
        assassinations or executions and disappearances.

   Women

    88. The USSDR states on page 21 that notwithstanding the Constitutional
        Declaration including  references  to  equal  rights,  the  interim
        governments did not  enforce  the  prohibitions  particularly  with
        regard to  women  and  minorities.  Militias  and  extremists  used
        violence  and  intimidation  against  women  they   considered   in
        violation of religious law and cultural norms. The law criminalizes
        rape but does not address spousal rape.  A  convicted  rapist  must
        marry the victim, with her agreement, or serve a prison term of  up
        to 25 years. According to local  contacts  and  NGO's,  the  forced
        marriage of victims to rape perpetrators as a way to avoid criminal
        proceedings has reportedly stopped.

    89. The Home Office Operational Guidance Note for  Libya  dated  9  May
        2013 ("OGN") states that in  rural  areas  societal  discrimination
        restricted women's movements, even to local destinations. Referring
        to the Freedom House report it states  that  most  women  will  not
        travel unless accompanied by a husband or male relative. Members of
        the elite have more freedom in this regard but are  still  expected
        to have permission of their families  in  order  to  travel  abroad
        (2.3.8).

    90. The same paragraph continues  in  stating  that  travelling  within
        Libya is difficult, as Libyan hotels generally do not rent rooms to
        unaccompanied women, due to cultural and traditional  requirements.
        Women rarely walk in the street in the evenings, unless accompanied
        by a male family member or another woman.  There  are  a  range  of
        related  cultural  and  social  restrictions  which  are  generally
        stronger  in  rural  areas  and  small  towns.   It   is   socially
        unacceptable for an unmarried or divorced woman to live on her own.



    91. Both the COI and the OGN describe the problems faced  by  women  in
        Libya in terms of discrimination and domestic violence,  with  laws
        that do not protect women's rights. During the revolution thousands
        of women were raped.

    92. 3.11.15 of the OGN states as follows:

             "Given the generalised discrimination towards women  in  Libya,
             and  the  inability  of  the  current  Government  to   provide
             protection against harm, it  is  likely  that  some  women  and
             especially particular sub-categories of women  (e.g.  women  of
             African  ethnicity,  victims  of  sexual  violence,  and  women
             perceived to have been allied to the Gaddafi  regime)  will  be
             able to demonstrate a need for  international  protection.  All
             relevant factors should be taken into  account,  including  the
             age,  health,  educational  and  economic   status,   and   the
             individual circumstances of the  applicant.  Female  applicants
             able to show they are at real risk of persecution because  they
             are accused  of  sexual  'misdemeanours'  or  offences  against
             family honour are likely to be able to show that they fall into
             the category of a particular social group (PSG)."

        And at 3.11.16:

             "Given the circumstances and cultural factors  set  out  above,
             female applicants who have been  raped  by  soldiers  loyal  to
             Gaddafi or other combatants are also likely to be able to  show
             that they are at real  risk  as  members  of  a  PSG.  Evidence
             suggests that even where the rape victim's  father  or  husband
             does not attach personal blame to her,  as  is  the  case  with
             other categories of sexual dishonour, she is still at  risk  of
             being the subject of an 'honour' killing, in order to save  her
             and her family from dishonour."

    93. Libya Herald on 23 September  2013  reported  that  the  government
        intended to clamp down on violence against women, while  presenting
        legislation to the GNC to guarantee equality between men and women,
        backed up by legal sanctions. Justice  Minister  Salah  Bashir  Al-
        Marghani said that the issue of violence against women  had  to  be
        addressed.

    94. A BBC news report dated 13 December 2011 refers  to  women  heading
        two ministries in the new government, health  and  social  affairs.
        The report describes Libya as a deeply conservative, male-dominated
        society where wedding  parties  and  public  gatherings  are  often
        segregated and men traditionally take the political  decisions.  An
        assertive new generation of women's rights is  emerging,  gathering
        every day in  homes,  offices  and  Tripoli's  smarter  hotels,  to
        discuss and set out their demands. Referring to a  protest  outside
        the prime minister's office, it states that dozens of women covered
        their mouths with tape to symbolise the  silence  with  which  rape
        victims were greeted by the interim government.

   Security/policing/judiciary

    95. Under  the  heading  "Safety  and  Security",  The  Report  of  the
        Secretary-General on the United Nations Support  Mission  in  Libya
        dated 5 September 2013, the report refers to  the  bombing  of  the
        French embassy in Tripoli  in  April  2013,  the  targeting  of  an
        Italian diplomatic vehicle in June and  the  firing  of  a  rocket-
        propelled grenade at the UAE embassy in July. In June UN  staff  in
        Sabha were temporarily relocated to  Tripoli  after  armed  clashes
        between rival tribes and the closure of the city airport.

    96. In a Security Council Briefing  dated  16  September  2013  by  the
        Special Representative of the Secretary-General and Head of UNSMIL,
        at para 16 it reports that progress  in  integrating  revolutionary
        fighters into the police and army remains very limited, as is their
        reintegration  into  civilian  life.  However,  to  encourage  such
        fighters to enlist in the army and to improve  salary  for  current
        uniformed personnel, salary increases  were  to  take  effect  from
        January 2014. The training outside Libya of 12-15,000 soldiers  was
        also announced. The Briefing goes  on  to  state  that  the  Libyan
        police continue to integrate individuals from the armed brigades.

    97. In a detailed report  entitled  "Searching  for  Justice  in  Post-
        Gaddafi Libya" described as a socio-legal exploration  of  people's
        concerns and institutional responses at home and  from  abroad,  it
        states at 2.2.3 that the development of an active civil society has
        been supported by government policy and NGOs  have  in  many  cases
        become a vehicle for policy initiatives. Para 3.3.1 notes that  Law
        37/2012 outlawing the "glorification" of  the  Qadhafi  regime  was
        struck down as being unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.

    98. The OGN of 9 May 2013 at 2.2.3 states that Libya continued to  make
        efforts to form national security  services.  The  numbers  in  the
        security services are said to be unclear  although  in  March  2012
        Libya's Interior Minister  said  that  the  police  force  numbered
        25,000 "and was able to provide security". Nevertheless,  at  2.2.6
        it states that the authorities struggled to establish a functioning
        military and police that could enforce and maintain law and  order.
        Many of the armed groups refused to disarm and filled the  security
        void. Some cooperated with the  government  and  provided  security
        services. Others operated without state sanction. At 2.2.9 the  OGN
        states that the police force remained weak and depended largely  on
        the SSC for ensuring law and order,  although  the  SSC's  lack  of
        vetting criteria and scant training contributed  to  abuse  by  its
        members.

    99. The judicial system is stated to  remain  weak,  with  threats  and
        attacks on prosecutors and judges further inhibiting  the  rule  of
        law. There are some  functioning  courts  in  city  centres  trying
        ordinary cases. An estimate of 9,000 is given in  relation  to  the
        number of those in  government  or  military  custody  without  any
        formal trial or sentencing, although later at 3.10.14 the estimated
        figure is given as 7,000.

   100. The conclusion at 2.2.17 is that:

             "The current  limitations  of  Libya's  legal  system  for  the
             detection, prosecution  and  punishment  of  acts  constituting
             persecution or serious harm  mean  that  in  general  claimants
             would not always be able to access effective protection."

   101. Regarding internal  relocation,  paras  2.3.3-2.3.9  refer  to  the
        closed military zone in the south of the country  and  difficulties
        with  land  border  crossings,  including  threats  from   criminal
        activities in areas bordering Sudan, Chad, Niger and Algeria.  With
        the exception of the official land border crossings to Tunisia  and
        Egypt, visitors and residents are not permitted to  travel  in  the
        interior or to border areas without an officially sanctioned  guide
        or specific permission from the authorities.

   102. Referring at 3.9.8 to FCO  travel  advice  for  Libya,  updated  in
        January 2013, it states that violent clashes between  armed  groups
        are possible across the country, particularly at night, and even in
        those places that have previously  avoided  conflict.  These  often
        include the use of heavy weapons.  There  is  a  high  threat  from
        terrorism. Attacks could be  indiscriminate,  including  in  places
        frequented by expatriates and foreign travellers  and  there  is  a
        threat of kidnapping (3.9.9).

   103. At 3.9.13 it is stated that:

             "Libya has become  a  patchwork  of  factions  whose  continued
             presence - one that appears  to  be  empowering  warlords  over
             elected  officials  -  makes  it  difficult   to   ensure   the
             establishment and maintenance of a single body of law that  can
             apply equally and to all."

   104. The OGN assesses at 3.9.20 that:

             "There continue to be outbursts of internal armed  conflict  in
             parts of Libya, but it is not at such a level, either in  Libya
             generally or a material part of it,  that  substantial  grounds
             exist for believing that any civilian would,  solely  by  being
             present there, face a real risk of serious harm.  The  security
             and humanitarian situation in Libya  remains  fluid,  and  some
             individuals may fall into an  enhanced  risk  category  on  the
             basis of certain characteristics. Each case must be  considered
             on its individual merits."

   105. A number of reports deal with what on the face  of  them  could  be
        described as political acts of violence.  BBC  news  Africa  on  10
        October 2013, reporting on instability in the  country  noted  that
        the Italian Consulate in Benghazi was attacked in January 2013, the
        French embassy in Tripoli in April, the EU's convoy in  August  and
        the Russian embassy in October (2013). AI reported on 8 March  2013
        on the attack on a TV station which had broadcast  a  debate  about
        the proposed Political Isolation Law. During the  attack  Al-Assema
        TV, a private news channel in Tripoli, was stormed by armed men who
        abducted four people.

   106. BBC news Africa reported on 30 April 2013 that the offices  of  the
        Libyan Justice Ministry in Tripoli were  surrounded  by  armed  men
        demanding the expulsion of officials who worked for the  government
        during the Qadhafi era. The report goes  on  to  state  that  armed
        groups have targeted state buildings in the past.

   107.  In a report dated 8 August 2013 Human Rights Watch  ("HRW")  state
        that at least 51 people have been killed "in a broadening  wave  of
        apparent political assassinations" in Benghazi and Derna in eastern
        Libya, although it later states that the actual number is  probably
        higher. The victims included a political activist, two  judges  and
        at least 44 serving members of the security forces,  most  of  whom
        had held positions in the Qadhafi government, at least  six  having
        been  high  ranking  officers   under   Qadhafi.   Such   political
        assassinations are said in the report to have peaked in the  second
        half of 2012 and again in January  and  July  2014.  No  groups  or
        individuals had claimed responsibility for the  assassinations  and
        the only person known to have been arrested escaped.

   108. HRW information was to the effect that 12 victims  were  apparently
        killed by explosive devices targeting their cars and the rest  were
        shot, mostly  in  drive-by  shootings  in  front  of  their  homes,
        workplaces or in their cars. The suspect who escaped was  shown  in
        an on-line video apparently confessing  to  having  killed  several
        people stating that commanders of Islamist  militias  operating  in
        eastern Libya gave orders for the killing of  former  officers  and
        that they had said that it was acceptable to kill army officers and
        people affiliated with the current government. In a second video he
        stated that he had confessed under torture.

   109. Given the fact  that  most  of  the  attacks  targeted  Qadhafi-era
        officers in the  Benghazi  and  Derna  area  and  the  planned  and
        efficient manner of the killings, it is  suggested  in  the  report
        that they are related and part of a  pattern  or  campaign  against
        individuals with a particular profile.

   110. HRW stated that Benghazi has  experienced  large-scale  attacks  by
        various militias on  state  security  forces  facilities  and  army
        positions as well as armed clashes  between  militia  factions  and
        attacks on foreign diplomatic missions. There is  reference  to  an
        attack on the International Committee of the Red Cross ("ICRC")  in
        May 2012, with a militia accusing the  ICRC  of  proselytising  for
        Christianity including distributing Bibles.

   111. Reuters reported on 5 October 2012 that at least 12  soldiers  were
        killed in an attack on a checkpoint near the city of Bani Walid. In
        a further report dated 9 November 2013 the killing of two policemen
        in Benghazi by gunmen is referred to, and stating that this  was  a
        day after the army had vowed to restore  order  in  the  city.  The
        report goes on to state that security in the city has  deteriorated
        in the past  few  months  "with  militants  and  Islamists  roaming
        unchallenged".

   112. The blockade of an oil port by Berbers in western Libya in  October
        2013 is reported by  the  Society  for  Threatened  Peoples  on  28
        October 2013. It is said to have been a form of protest against the
        ongoing exclusion of ethnic or racial minorities.

   113. In an article in Libya Herald dated 14  October  2013  there  is  a
        report on the conference on the Transitional Justice Law,  held  in
        Tripoli on 30 September 2013. The President of the GNC is  said  to
        have explained the aims of the  law  which  include  provision  for
        compensation  for  victims  of  the  Qadhafi  regime  and  of   the
        revolution, to provide justice  and  compensation  for  victims  of
        injustice since the revolution and promote national reconciliation.
        A Fact-Finding and Reconciliation Board is to be  set  up.  Amongst
        its tasks will be to look at the position of  internally  displaced
        persons, such as the Tawurga, missing  persons,  those  imprisoned,
        and to investigate attacks on people by  militias,  individuals  or
        state bodies. The rights of those accused of  human  rights  crimes
        will be guaranteed in the proposed law, and  no  civilian  will  be
        tried in a military court.

   114. A further Libya Herald article dated 24 October 2013  refers  to  a
        newly  passed   legislation   against   torture,   kidnapping   and
        discrimination, including  with  reference  to  holders  of  public
        office, bureaucrats  and  members  of  the  security  forces  being
        subject to the law and to ensure that the prohibited  offences  did
        not take place.

   115. A report from No  Peace  Without  Justice  dated  25  October  2013
        describes details of a series of activities and workshops between 5-
        8 October 2013 "to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  Libyan  national
        institutions and civil  society  actors  on  accountability,  human
        rights and the rule of law." The Tripoli Bar Association as well as
        judges and various experts took part.

   116. Libya travel advice-Gov UK, as of 17 October 2013 was  against  all
        but essential travel to Tripoli, Zuwara, Zawiye, al  Khums,  Zlitan
        and Misrata, and to  the  coastal  towns  from  Ras  Lanuf  to  the
        Egyptian border, with the exception of Benghazi. It then goes on to
        state that the FCO advises against all travel to all other parts of
        Libya, including Benghazi.

   117. A BBC News Africa report  dated  11  October  2013  refers  to  the
        "brief" kidnap of the Prime Minister Ali Zeidan, who  described  it
        as an attempted coupe. He was seized from a Tripoli hotel and  held
        for several hours by more than 100  armed  militiamen.  The  report
        states that the motive for the abduction remains unclear  but  some
        militias had been angered by the recent US Commando raid in Tripoli
        to capture the senior al-Qaeda suspect Anas al-Liby.

   118. Al Arabiya reported on 12  November  2013  that  the  Libyan  Prime
        Minister the previous day had vowed to supply more aid to  security
        forces struggling to pacify Benghazi. The report goes on  to  refer
        to an attack the previous week in which  a  public  prosecutor  and
        five members of the security forces were  killed  in  a  series  of
        attacks in "the region" (of Benghazi). With reference to the kidnap
        of the Prime Minister the head of an interior  ministry  anti-crime
        unit is reported as having boasted that he was behind the "arrest".



   119. Air Transport World on 4 November 2013 reported that Etihad Airways
        had temporarily suspended its thrice weekly passenger  flights  and
        twice weekly cargo flights to  Tripoli  due  to  what  the  airline
        described as unspecified "safety  and  operational  challenges"  in
        recent months. It said it had been concerned about  the  conditions
        at Tripoli airport over recent months.

   120. The report dated 16 October 2013 from Voice of America News  "Chaos
        Continues in Libya Where Militias Rule" states  that  chaos  reigns
        where a barely functioning central government is unable to  control
        the "thousands" of militias  that  roam  the  country.  The  report
        refers to an estimate  of  200,000  militiamen  spread  across  the
        country,  forming  a  "parallel  state"  over  which  the   central
        government has no power. An analyst  who  had  just  returned  from
        Libya stated that:

             "You have communal clashes...militias fighting over control  of
             airports or smuggling  routes...shutting  down  oil  production
             facilities...kidnappings."

   121. Libya Herald reports dated 4 August 2013 and 20 July 2013 refer  to
        a Qatar airways flight being unable  to  land  at  Tripoli  airport
        because of specific security concerns in relation  to  the  flight,
        and clashes around the airport in July.

   122. The HRW report dated 17 November 2013  states  that  militias  from
        Misrata fired assault rifles, machine guns  and  heavy  weapons  at
        overwhelmingly peaceful  protestors  in  Tripoli  on  15  November,
        Ensuing clashes between armed groups and militias  left  43  people
        dead and at least 460 wounded. State security forces present at the
        initial protest are said to have failed to protect protestors or to
        arrest and disarm the militias. The report goes on  to  state  that
        the 43 people  killed  included  people  who  were  apparently  not
        involved in the protest or the clashes. Two of the  victims  appear
        to have been medical personnel who were trying to retrieve  wounded
        people.

   123. In what is described as a related incident, HRW was told that armed
        men from Misrata entered Tripoli's  al-Fallah  camp  for  displaced
        residents of Tawurga on 16 November 2013 and fired indiscriminately
        at residents, leaving at least one man dead and three injured.

   124. Deutsche Welle reported on 17 November 2013 that the Deputy Head of
        Libyan Intelligence was abducted in Tripoli.

   125. A former Coventry University student has, according to a report  in
        the Coventry Evening Telegraph dated 12  September  2013,  been  in
        custody in Libya having been arrested on his return there in  2012.
        He is said to have been accused of taking  part  in  demonstrations
        and spreading false information on the internet  about  the  Libyan
        uprising. At the time he was  studying  mechanical  engineering  at
        Coventry University on a Libyan government scholarship.  His  trial
        was adjourned because the judge did not turn  up  for  the  hearing
        having been adjourned several times before. A Libya  Herald  report
        of 10 September 2013 carries a similar report in  relation  to  the
        student's expected appearance at court the  following  day.  An  AI
        news report dated 10 September 2013 deals with the same case.

[1] See paragraph 6 for comment on nomenclature
[2] Spelling as in the report of Dr George
[3] The COI at 10.6 describes Libya Shield as a coalition of  militias  from
the east, Misrata, and Zintan that acts in parallel  with  Libya's  national
army.
[4] At 10.06 the COI in relation to the SSC states "The force  is  estimated
to  consist  of  90,000  to  100,000   fighters.   These   men,   ostensibly
revolutionaries,  act  as  a  sort  of   national   gendarmerie,   providing
transitional security at the local level, particularly during  the  election
period. But ominously, the SCC has not managed to break down  the  fighters'
old allegiances: entire brigades have joined en masse and  their  commanders
have simply switched hats."
[5] Described by Professor Joff� as a generic title for "a shadowy network
of salafi-jihadi militias".
[6] Also spelt Tabu, Toubou and Tubu-See OGN 9 May 2013 at 3.12.18
[7] Translated in various reports as "revolutionaries" and otherwise spelt
as "thuwwar".
