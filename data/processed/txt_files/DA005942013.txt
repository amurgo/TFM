Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr A Joseph, instructed by Turpin & Miller
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr I Richards, Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This appeal is subject to an anonymity order by the First-tier Tribunal
    pursuant to rule  45(4)(i)  of  the  Asylum  and  Immigration  Tribunal
    (Procedure) Rules 2005 (SI 2005/230).   Neither  party  invited  me  to
    rescind the order and I continue it pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal
    Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (SI 2008/2698).





The Background

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Venezuela who was born on 15 March  1993.
    On 10 January 2011, the appellant was convicted  at  the  Inner  London
    Crown Court, following a trial, of robbery contrary to s.8 of the Theft
    Act 1968.  He was sentenced to a term of  six  years'  detention  in  a
    Youth  Offender  Institution.   At  the  time  of  his  conviction  the
    appellant was 17 years of age.  On 1 March 2013, the Secretary of State
    made a decision to make a deportation order against  the  appellant  by
    virtue of s.3(5)(a) of the Immigration  Act  1971.   The  Secretary  of
    State concluded that the appellant's deportation was "conducive to  the
    public good" and there were "no exceptional circumstances" to  outweigh
    the public interest presumption in para 296 of  the  Immigration  Rules
    (HC 395 as  amended).   The  Secretary  of  State  concluded  that  the
    appellant's deportation would not breach Art 8 of the ECHR.

 3. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.  In a  determination
    promulgated on 29 April 2013, the First-tier Tribunal (Judge  Cresswell
    and Mr P Bompas) dismissed  the  appellant's  appeal.   The  First-tier
    Tribunal found that the appellant's deportation would not breach Art 8.

 4. On 17 May 2013, the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Froom)  granted  the
    appellant permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.  The reasons  for
    the grant of permission were as follows:

         "I grant permission to appeal because  it  is  arguable  the  panel
         misunderstood the decision under appeal.   The  decision  was  made
         under section 3(5)(a) of  the  Immigration  Act  1971.   The  panel
         directed themselves in terms of section 32 of the  UK  Borders  Act
         2007, even though the appellant was under 18 at  the  date  of  his
         conviction.  In particular, at paragraph  16,  the  panel  recorded
         that the respondent was obliged to make a deportation order and the
         appellant was liable to deportation in accordance with section  32.
         Further argument may be necessary to determine whether  this  error
         turns out to have been material."

 5. Thus, the appeal came before me.

The Appellant's Case

 6. Mr Joseph's submissions on  behalf  of  the  appellant  fell  into  two
    categories.  First, he submitted that the Tribunal had  been  wrong  to
    approach the appellant's appeal on the basis that he was subject to the
    automatic deportation provisions in the UK  Borders  Act  2007.   Those
    provisions were, he submitted, not  applicable  as  the  appellant  was
    under the age of 18 at the date of conviction (see s.33(3) of the  2007
    Act).  As a result, Mr Joseph submitted that the Tribunal had failed to
    consider whether  the  appellant  was  "liable  to  deportation"  under
    s.3(5)(a) of the Immigration Act 1971 and whether the  public  interest
    justified his deportation.  Mr Joseph also submitted  that  this  error
    spilled over into the Tribunal's Art 8 assessment which could not, as a
    consequence, stand.

 7. Secondly, Mr Joseph  made  a  number  of  submissions  challenging  the
    Tribunal  finding   that   the   appellant's   deportation   would   be
    proportionate and to dismiss his appeal under Art 8.

The Automatic Deportation Issue

 8. I begin with Mr Joseph's first submission.

 9. At para 16 of its determination the Tribunal clearly considered that it
    was  dealing  with  a  case  governed  by  the  automatic   deportation
    provisions in the UK Borders Act 2007.  The Tribunal said this:

         "16. The Appellant is not a British citizen and was convicted of an
             offence of robbery and sentenced to 6 years detention; he is a
             foreign criminal and the Respondent was obliged  to  make  her
             deportation order.  He is, therefore, liable to deportation in
             accordance with Section 32 Borders Act 2007.  We will consider
             whether an exception applies  on  the  basis  pleaded  by  the
             Appellant of a breach of his Article 8 rights."

10. Having then considered the application of the Immigration Rules, namely
    paras 397-399A, the Tribunal at  paras  19-33  considered  whether  the
    appellant's deportation breached Art 8.  In concluding in para 33  that
    his deportation was proportionate, the Tribunal concluded:

         "There is here no Exception within Section 33 of the UKBA."

11. The Tribunal was wrong to approach the appellant's appeal on the  basis
    that it was governed by the automatic deportation provisions in the  UK
    Borders Act 2007.  Although the appellant was  undoubtedly  a  "foreign
    criminal" to which, in principle, the 2007 Act applied, he fell  within
    "Exception 2" in s.33(3) because he was "under the age  of  18  on  the
    date of conviction".

12. Accepting that error, the crucial  question  is  whether  it  made  any
    material difference to the Tribunal's decision.  Mr Joseph referred  me
    to the Upper Tribunal's decision in Bah (EO  (Turkey)  -  liability  to
    deport) [2012] UKUT 0019 (IAC).  That decision  considered  the  proper
    approach to be followed in a deportation appeal not falling within s.32
    of the UK Borders Act 2007.  The three-stage approach identified by the
    UT is helpfully set out  in  the  italic  words  of  that  decision  as
    follows:

         "In a deportation appeal not falling within section 32  of  the  UK
         Borders Act 2007, the sequence of decision making  set  out  in  EO
         (deportation appeals: scope and process)  Turkey  [2007]  UKAIT  62
         still applies but the first step is expanded as follows:

         i)   Consider whether the person is liable to be  deported  on  the
             grounds set out by the Secretary of State.  This will normally
             involve the judge examining:-

             a.   Whether the material facts alleged by  the  Secretary  of
                  State are accepted and if not whether they are made out to
                  the civil standard flexibly applied;

             b.   Whether on the facts established viewed as  a  whole  the
                  conduct character or associations reach such  a  level  of
                  seriousness as to justify a decision to deport;

             c.   In considering b) the judge  will  take  account  of  any
                  lawful policy of the Secretary of State  relevant  to  the
                  exercise of the  discretion  to  deport  and  whether  the
                  discretion has been  exercised  in  accordance  with  that
                  policy;

         ii)  If the person is liable to deportation, then the next question
             to consider is whether a  human  rights  or  protection  claim
             precludes deportation.  In cases of private  or  family  life,
             this will require an assessment of the proportionality of  the
             measures against the family or private life in question, and a
             weighing of all relevant factors.

         iii) If the two previous steps are decided against  the  appellant,
             then the question whether the discretion to  deport  has  been
             exercised in accordance with the Immigration Rules  applicable
             is the third step in the process.  The present wording of  the
             rules assumes that a person who is liable to  deportation  and
             whose deportation would not be contrary  to  the  law  and  in
             breach of human rights  should  normally  be  deported  absent
             exceptional circumstances to be assessed in the light  of  all
             relevant information placed before the Tribunal."

13. Mr Joseph submitted that the Tribunal had failed to  consider  properly
    the first step set out in Bah, namely whether the appellant was  liable
    to be deported on the basis of his criminality.  He submitted that  the
    Tribunal in para 16 had been wrong to apply s.32(4) that states that:

         "For the purposes of Section 3(5)a of the Immigration Act 1971, the
         deportation of a foreign criminal is conducive to the public good."

14. Mr Joseph referred me to s.33(7) which stated that:

         "The application of an exception  -

         ....

         (b)  results in its being assumed neither that deportation  of  the
             person concerned is conducive to the public good nor  that  it
             is not conducive to the public good; but section 32(4) applies
             despite the application of Exception 1 or 4."

15. As s.33(7) makes plain, whilst s.32(4) continues to apply and  deem  an
    individual's deportation to be  "conductive  to  the  public  good"  if
    Exception  1  (breach  of  Convention  or  Refugee  Convention)  or   4
    (extradition etc)  applies,  it  does  not  apply  if  Exception  2  is
    applicable as it is in this appeal.  On the face of it, therefore,  the
    prior question of whether the appellant  was  "liable  to  deportation"
    under s.3(5)(a) fell to be decided by the Tribunal  before  considering
    whether Art 8 prevented the appellant's deportation.  That said,  there
    are, in my judgment, two reasons why Mr Joseph's  submissions  on  this
    point cannot succeed.

16. First, there was the stance taken on behalf of the appellant before the
    First-tier Tribunal.  It was no part of the appellant's case before the
    First-tier Tribunal that he  was  not  "liable  to  deportation"  under
    s.3(5)(a) of the Immigration Act 1971 or that, given his offending, his
    deportation was not justified other than to argue it would  breach  Art
    8.  The notice of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal relies  exclusively
    upon Art 8.  Likewise,  the  skeleton  argument  dated  25  April  2013
    prepared, it would appear, by Counsel also relies exclusively on Art  8
    and the appellant's private life in the UK.  The Tribunal's  Record  of
    Proceedings shows that Mr Joseph (who represented the appellant  before
    the Tribunal) did not seek to expand beyond the grounds of  appeal  and
    his skeleton argument.  It is clear,  therefore,  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal was not invited to find that the appellant was not "liable  to
    deportation" or that  deportation  was  not  justified  in  the  public
    interest other than on the basis that his deportation would breach  Art
    8.  Given that stance, it is difficult to see how the Tribunal's  error
    could have led it to make a finding on this issue  in  the  appellant's
    favour since the appellant did not seek such a finding.

17. Secondly, in any event, there is no  realistic  basis  upon  which  the
    Tribunal could have made such a  finding  in  the  appellant's  favour.
    When I enquired of Mr Joseph whether he was  now  submitting  that  the
    appellant's offending did not make him "liable to deportation" as being
    conducive to the public good, Mr Joseph was not able to summon  up  any
    argument in the  appellant's  favour.   In  my  judgment,  that  merely
    reflects the hopeless nature  of  any  argument  that  the  appellant's
    offending did not make his deportation "conducive to the public  good".
    The appellant was convicted of robbery  and  sentenced  to  six  years'
    detention in a YOI.  In her decision letter, the Secretary of State set
    out her reason for concluding  that  the  appellant's  deportation  was
    conducive to the public good and that the public interest justified his
    deportation as follows:

         "Circumstances of the offence

         The Secretary  of  State  regards  as  particularly  serious  those
         offences involving violence, sex, arson and drugs.  Also taken into
         account is the sentencing Court's view of the  seriousness  of  the
         offence, as reflected in the  sentence  imposed,  as  well  as  the
         effect of that type of crime on the wider community.  The  type  of
         offence and its seriousness, together with the need to protect  the
         public from serious crime and its  effects  are  important  factors
         when considering whether deportation is in the public interest.  In
         addition to these factors your personal circumstances together with
         the circumstances of your offence(s) have been carefully looked at.


         In your case the sentencing judge made the following comments;


         [EOM], would you stand  up,  please.   You  were  convicted  of  an
         extremely violent robbery back in January in which you, with  other
         persons, stalked the victim as  he  walked  from  the  Fulham  Road
         towards Battersea Bridge.  He was drunk, as you  clearly  realised.
         The CCTV shows that you were following with others and, in my view,
         waiting for your opportunity to jump him and rob him.   The  moment
         came when he got to the bottom of Church  Street  and  was  on  the
         embankment.  The victim's injuries were serious.  They  included  a
         left shattered cheek bone, his right cheek bone was caved  in.   He
         had two steel plates inserted on the left side of his face.   There
         was a manipulation necessary of his cheek  bone.   It  was  a  very
         painful operation.  He has been left with significant numbness.  He
         was in hospital for five days and I read, and it has been read out,
         the victim impact statement from the victim, which you  have  heard
         as well in this court, which indicates that the  victim  is  living
         with the permanent consequences of this attack upon him.


         You have two previous convictions namely on 18 August 2010 you were
         convicted  of  using  disorderly  behaviour  and  two   counts   of
         assaulting a constable, for which you were sentenced  to  one  year
         youth rehabilitation order;  and  on  23  November  2010  you  were
         convicted of wounding/inflicting  grievous  bodily  harm  and  were
         sentenced to a year youth rehabilitation order.




         Presumption in favour of deportation


         In view of this, consideration has been given as to whether or  not
         deportation is the  appropriate  course  in  your  case.   Specific
         regard has been given to paragraph 396 of the Immigration Rules (as
         amended).  Paragraph 396 provides that there is a presumption  that
         the public interest requires the deportation of  a  person  who  is
         liable to deportation.  In considering whether the  presumption  is
         outweighed in any particular case all relevant  factors  are  taken
         into account, including whether the decision  to  take  deportation
         action would place the United Kingdom  in  breach  of  any  of  its
         obligations under the European Convention on Human  Rights  (ECHR).
         Therefore we are obliged in making any decision to consider whether
         you have any claim to remain which would outweigh  the  presumption
         to deport.


         Your representations have been  taken  into  account  but  for  the
         reasons stated below it is not considered that they are  sufficient
         to demonstrate that you should not be removed to Venezuela.  It  is
         considered there are no exceptional circumstances to  outweigh  the
         public interest presumption.  It is  therefore  concluded  that  in
         your case it is appropriate to deport you to Venezuela."

18. The Secretary of State's decision took into  account  the  Crown  Court
    judge's sentencing remarks concerning the circumstances  of  the  index
    offence of the appellant.  The decision letter was, of  course,  before
    the Tribunal which referred to it at paras 6 and the sentencing judge's
    remarks at para 15(xii)-(xiv).

19. At para 18 of its determination, the Tribunal records the  position  of
    Mr Joseph on behalf of the appellant in relation to the application  of
    the 'new Article 8 Rules', namely  paras  399  and  399A.   There,  the
    Tribunal  notes  that  he  did  not  suggest  that  there  were:   "any
    exceptional circumstance such that the public interest  in  deportation
    could be outweighed by other factors." The Tribunal added in  para  18,
    "We could see none either".

20. In considering the legality  of  the  appellant's  deportation  without
    reference to Art 8, para 396 of the Rules states that:

         "Where a person is liable to deportation the presumption  shall  be
         that the public interest requires deportation."

21. Paragraph 397 then goes on to state:

         "Where deportation would not be contrary to [the Refugee Convention
         or the Human Rights Convention], it will  only  be  in  exceptional
         circumstances  that  the  public   interest   in   deportation   is
         outweighed". (my emphasis).

22. In truth, the appellant effectively conceded  that  there  was  nothing
    "exceptional" about his case that prevented his deportation  under  the
    Rules.  That concession  was  made  specifically  in  relation  to  the
    'single Article 8 Rules' in para 398 but  was,  in  truth,  no  less  a
    statement of the reality in applying para 397.

23. Before the First-tier  Tribunal,  the  appellant  unequivocally  relied
    exclusively upon Art 8.  He no doubt did so on the basis that he had no
    prospect of succeeding otherwise.  Although the Tribunal was  wrong  to
    approach the  appeal  on  the  basis  that  the  automatic  deportation
    provisions applied, the appellant had no prospect of succeeding on  the
    basis that his deportation was  not  "conducive  to  the  public  good"
    (s.3(5)(a)  of  the  1971  Act)  or  that   there   were   "exceptional
    circumstances"  which  outweighed  the  public   interest   given   his
    criminality (para 397).  Any error by the Tribunal was not material  to
    its decision and do not justify setting that decision aside.

24. For these reasons, I reject Mr Joseph's first submission.

The Article 8 Issues

25. I now  turn  to  Mr  Joseph's  submissions  made  in  relation  to  the
    Tribunal's finding that the appellant's deportation  was  proportionate
    and not a breach of Art 8.   I  begin,  however,  with  the  Tribunal's
    reasons which it is helpful to set out in some detail.

     1. The FtT's decision

26. Before the First-tier Tribunal, the appellant relied upon  his  private
    life in the UK.  He had come to the UK from Venezuela  in  August  2003
    with his brother and sister to join his father.  At that time he was 10
    years of age.  He was granted leave to remain and on 21 May 2008 he was
    granted indefinite leave to remain.  He was, therefore, settled in  the
    UK.

27. The First-tier Tribunal had before it a body of evidence concerning the
    appellant's offending  history  and  the  index  offence,  as  well  as
    evidence about his personal circumstances in  the  UK.   The  appellant
    also gave oral evidence before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  as  did  his
    stepmother with whom he had lived on arriving in the UK in  2003  until
    she left the family home sometime in 2009 when she separated  from  the
    appellant's father.  Until 2009, the  appellant  also  lived  with  his
    father and his stepsister.  The Tribunal made detailed findings of fact
    at para 15(i)-(xxi) as follows:

         "15. We find the following material facts.  We  emphasise  that  we
             have come to our findings after considering the evidence as  a
             whole and that the order of  findings  in  this  determination
             does not indicate the order in which we came to our  findings.
             We had the benefit of seeing and listening most  carefully  to
             the Appellant as he gave  his  evidence.   In  coming  to  our
             conclusions we had regard to all the evidence before us.

             (i)  We start by recording the Appellant's history.  He  first
                  came to the UK from Venezuela on 6  August  2003  with  is
                  brother and sister to join his  father.   On  16  December
                  2003, he was granted leave to remain as a dependant of his
                  father, which leave was renewed on 27  May  2006  and  was
                  followed by a grant of indefinite leave to  remain  on  21
                  May 2008.

             (ii) The Appellant's father married the witness,  [CCP]  ("Mrs
                  P"), on 5 November 2004.  Mrs P  had  a  daughter  by  her
                  previous husband, [FLGC] ([L]).

             (iii)    There was disharmony in the home.   Mrs  P  found  it
                  difficult to get  on  with  the  appellant's  brother  and
                  sister,  the  brother  being  involved  with  drugs,   and
                  eventually the brother and sister  returned  to  Venezuela
                  where their mother had remained.  The brother was in  fact
                  deported to Venezuela.  The Appellant was not treated well
                  by his father and there were violent incidents.

             (iv) In 2009, the Appellant moved with his father and Mrs P to
                  a new address, leaving  L  at  the  old  address.   Mrs  P
                  discovered that  the  Appellant's  father  was  having  an
                  affair and that brought her relationship with  him  to  an
                  end.

             (v)  In June 2009, the  Appellant  committed  the  offence  of
                  robbery, more details of which we will provide later.   He
                  was arrested in August 2009 and was then on bail until his
                  trial and sentence, which we have detailed above.

             (vi) The Appellant has a history of offending.  He  was  first
                  reprimanded  by  the  Police  on  21  February  2007   for
                  possessing an offensive weapon on school premises  earlier
                  that month.  He was then warned on 20 October 2008,  again
                  by the Police, for theft from a person on  30  July  2008.
                  As we have indicated above, he then committed the  robbery
                  on 7 June 2009, which we will return to later.

             (vii)    Having been arrested in August 2009  in  relation  to
                  the robbery, the Appellant came under  the  assistance  of
                  the  local  Youth  Offending  Team.   In  July  2010,  Sue
                  Edwards, a Youth Justice Officer, met him and she provided
                  him with temporary  accommodation  because  he  could  not
                  return home to his father because their  relationship  was
                  so poor.

             (viii)   On 1 August 2010, the Appellant was guilty  of  using
                  disorderly  behaviour   or   threatening/abusive/insulting
                  words likely to cause harassment, alarm  or  distress  and
                  assaulting two constables for which he was sentenced on 18
                  August 2010  at  Camberwell  Green  Juvenile  Court  to  a
                  Referral Order for 6 months.

             (ix)  On  30  August  2010,  the  Appellant  wounded/inflicted
                  grievous bodily  harm  on  a  person,  for  which  he  was
                  sentenced on 23 November 2010 at Waltham  Forest  Juvenile
                  Court to a Youth Rehabilitation Order for 1  year  with  a
                  supervision requirement and for which he  was  ordered  to
                  pay compensation of �300, the Youth  Rehabilitation  Order
                  being also substituted for  his  earlier  Referral  Order.
                  The Pre Sentence Report records that this offence involved
                  the Appellant biting a relative  on  the  face  during  an
                  argument at a family gathering, inflicting injuries  which
                  required stitches.  The Appellant  told  us  that  he  had
                  bitten the man.

             (x)  The Appellant started a BTEC Level 2 Diploma in Sport  in
                  September 2010 at Haringey Sixth Form Centre.

             (xi) The Appellant subsequently moved to accommodation at YMCA
                  in about January 2011.

             (xii)    As we observe from  the  sentencing  remarks  of  His
                  Honour Judge Bishop, the Appellant was  'convicted  of  an
                  extremely violent robbery' which involved the stalking  of
                  a man who was drunk on the embankment of the Thames.   The
                  appellant and others could be seen on CCTV  following  the
                  man with the intention of jumping  him  and  robbing  him.
                  The man's 'injuries were serious.  They  included  a  left
                  shattered cheekbone, his right cheekbone was caved in.  He
                  had 2 steel plates inserted on the left side of his  face.
                  There was a manipulation necessary of his  cheekbone.   It
                  was a very painful  operation.   He  has  been  left  with
                  significant numbness.  He was in hospital for 5 days  and'
                  from the victim  impact  statement  'is  living  with  the
                  permanent consequences of  this  attack  upon  him'.   The
                  Appellant was recognised from the CCTV  and  the  victim's
                  mobile phone was found in the Appellant's room.   He  lied
                  to the Police about  his  acquisition  of  the  phone  and
                  clearly lied at his trial as to how  he  had  obtained  it
                  too.  It is apparent from the Pre Sentence Report that  he
                  told the author of the report  that  he  told  the  Police
                  three different stories before finally telling  the  truth
                  as he remembered it, which was clearly not accepted to  be
                  the truth by the jury.

             (xiii)   The Judge concluded that the Appellant's  version  of
                  events given for the Pre Sentence Report was not  truthful
                  and that he was a full participant in the  violent  attack
                  upon the man and that he was stalking  the  man  for  that
                  purpose.

             (xiv)    The Judge took account of the fact that the Appellant
                  was 16 at the time of the offence and 17 at  the  time  of
                  sentence and took account also of the difficulties that he
                  had had in his childhood and noted the improvement in  his
                  life since he was housed at the YMCA and  his  involvement
                  with sports  activities  and  his  training  course  as  a
                  fitness instructor.  The Judge also took  account  of  the
                  aggravating factors of a group attack, an attack at  night
                  and the attack being upon  a  vulnerable  person  who  was
                  stalked.  The Judge concluded that the Appellant  did  not
                  meet the statutory definition of 'dangerous'.   The  Judge
                  was able to mitigate a 7-year sentence to one of 6 years.

             (xv) The Appellant has clearly had a history of  violence  and
                  dishonesty.  We have detailed the nature of his  offences.
                  Two of the offences involve  dishonesty  in  the  form  of
                  theft and it is also clear from what we have detailed that
                  he has not been honest when apprehended in relation to the
                  robbery. We found him to be a reluctant  witness  and  one
                  who did not  always  tell  us  the  truth.   To  give  one
                  example, with some reluctance  he  accepted  that  he  had
                  spoken to his brother after his brother's  deportation  to
                  Venezuela; L told us that the Appellant had also spoken to
                  his brother whilst his brother was in detention.   We  did
                  not believe the Appellant's evidence to the effect that he
                  did not know why his brother had been  deported  and  that
                  the reason for the deportation never came  up  during  the
                  conversations.

             (xvi)    Indeed, it was clear to us  that  the  Appellant  was
                  seeking to minimise his connection with Venezuela and  his
                  family there with a view to 'pulling  the  wool  over  our
                  eyes'.

             (xvii)   It was clear to us that the Appellant  does  enjoy  a
                  very good relationship with L.  It was apparent  that  she
                  had provided him with support over the years that  he  has
                  been in the UK.  We had no reason to find other than  that
                  she was a wholly honest  witness.   It  was  she  who  had
                  represented him at school and when he was  interviewed  in
                  relation to the robbery, and there was evidence of regular
                  correspondence between him and her and of her visiting him
                  in detention.

             (xviii)  The evidence of Mrs P was less convincing.  We  noted
                  that there was no reference at all to  Mrs  P  within  the
                  comments which the Appellant made to the author of the Pre
                  Sentence Report.  Mrs P clearly  does  not  have  a  solid
                  grasp of the English language and gave her evidence via  a
                  Spanish interpreter.  Her evidence was to the effect  that
                  the Appellant would struggle in Venezuela because  he  had
                  been in a Colombian-speaking household in the  UK.   This,
                  however, ignored the fact that  he  was  living  with  his
                  father and for some time his brother and sister.  It  also
                  ignored  the  fact,  as  she  acknowledged  in  her   oral
                  evidence, that there is not  a  great  deal  of  variation
                  between  the  Spanish  spoken  in  Colombia  and  that  in
                  Venezuela.  We also noted that a letter from a Pastor [JP]
                  within the Appellant's bundle told us that  the  Appellant
                  was 'a gifted communicator whose proficiency in conversing
                  in English and Spanish with our church  members  has  been
                  exemplary'.

             (xix)    We found it significant  that  the  Appellant  has  a
                  wider family in Venezuela than was known to  either  L  or
                  Mrs P.  The Appellant told us that he has uncles and aunts
                  on his mother's side and upon his father's side too.   The
                  Pre Sentence Report paints a  different  picture  to  that
                  which the Appellant has  attempted  to  paint  during  his
                  appeal.  The author of the report, who saw  the  Appellant
                  on two occasions, recorded that the  Appellant  could  not
                  understand why he could  not  live  with  his  mother  and
                  missed her a great deal.   He  told  the  author  that  he
                  really missed his  mother  and  would  like  to  establish
                  contact with her.  He told her that he still  had  a  good
                  relationship with his brother and that  they  communicated
                  from abroad and that she advised  the  Appellant  to  seek
                  contact with his mother via his brother.

             (xx) The Pre Sentence Report placed the Appellant as being  at
                  a medium risk of re-offending and a medium risk of harm to
                  the community.  It recorded that alcohol had played a part
                  in his offending and that he had an inability  to  control
                  his temper.  The  author  said:  'All  matters  have  been
                  associated with violence  or  potential  violence  towards
                  others and this is concerning'.   The  Appellant  told  us
                  that at one stage he was drinking 2 to 3 bottles of brandy
                  in a day every few days.  Sue Edwards  recorded  that  the
                  Appellant was 'an angry young man  when  I  met  him,  but
                  during our time together we discussed his alcohol use  and
                  how  this  triggered  his  anger,  and  E  O  M  began  to
                  understand that his  anger  came  from  how  he  had  been
                  treated by his father fuelled his anger, and  the  use  of
                  alcohol to release him from these  feelings  was  actually
                  making things worse.'   She  recorded  that  whilst  being
                  supervised the Appellant was attending college, paying his
                  bills and taking responsibility  for  his  own  behaviour.
                  She saw him mature and  effect  change  in  his  own  life
                  during the time she worked with him.

             (xxi)    We do take account of the letters  and  statement  of
                  support for the appellant within his bundle."

28. Having set out a number of domestic and Strasbourg authorities at paras
    20-31 of its determination, the Tribunal concluded as follows  at  para
    32:

         "32. We have considered the provisions of Article 8 and  the  cases
             to which we have referred and we find that  the  removal  does
             interfere with private life for the purposes of Article  8(1).
             In short, we find that there is an interference with the right
             to  respect  for  private  life;  that  interference   is   in
             accordance  with  the  law.   However,  we   find   that   the
             interference  has  legitimate  aims   to   the   extent   that
             immigration control and the prevention of crime is in itself a
             legitimate aim."

29. Then, in para 33 the Tribunal went on to consider  the  proportionality
    of the appellant's deportation as follows:

         33.  Finally, we find that the interference is proportionate  in  a
             democratic society to the legitimate aim to be  achieved.   We
             take full account of the Appellant's  circumstances,  that  he
             has lived in the UK for 10  years  from  the  age  of  10  and
             attended school where he appears to have done relatively well;
             that he has a step-mother and step-sister in the UK  who  hold
             him in regard and affection and came to  support  him  at  the
             hearing; that there were documents showing support for him and
             he is likely to have other friends too; that he is  relatively
             young; that he has had a difficult and  challenging  childhood
             and has been an  alcohol  abuser.   He  is  still  in  prison,
             completing his sentence.  We were not told  about  his  future
             living circumstances.  He has not shown remorse for the brutal
             offence which had a serious impact  upon  the  victim  and  he
             continues  to  deny  his  offending  in  that  respect.    The
             appellant had been in the UK from the age of 10,  which  meant
             that some of his formative years were spent here; on the other
             hand, he had reached 10 immersed in the culture  of  Venezuela
             and had lived with his Venezuelan family  members  of  father,
             brother and sister in the UK, with his  father  until  only  a
             year or so before his incarceration, and  his  mother  visited
             him for some months in 2008, and he has been in  communication
             with his brother since he was deported,  all  of  which  would
             have maintained his cultural links.  He has maintained contact
             with his brother in Venezuela and wanted to renew contact with
             his mother.  He did commit his offences as a  youth,  but  the
             offences appeared to have  not  been  simply  the  actions  of
             immature youth, as they continued as he approached  adulthood.
             We found it significant that,  after  committing  the  vicious
             assault  upon  the  robbery  victim,  after  being   initially
             remanded in custody for that  offence  and  then  remanded  on
             strict bail conditions, he nevertheless went on to commit  two
             further incidents of violence in August 2010  and  at  a  time
             when he was being assisted by both L and the  Youth  Offending
             Team and when he  was  about  to  start  his  sports  training
             course.  The Appellant's private life in the UK appears to  be
             of a shallow nature, with the exception  of  the  relationship
             with L and his wish to continue his sports studies.   He  told
             us he would like to continue his sports studies.   There  were
             no actual plans for future training.  He appears to fit all of
             the relevant factors outlined in N (Kenya), and we have  taken
             full account of  the  Boultif  and  Maslov  guidance  and  the
             guidance in the other cases  to  which  we  have  referred  in
             concluding as we have.  The Appellant committed a very serious
             offence followed by a  further  serious  offence  of  unlawful
             wounding and has a background  of  offences  of  violence  and
             dishonesty and alcohol abuse.  He spent the  majority  of  his
             formative years (when his time in detention is discounted)  in
             Venezuela with his family of mother, brother  and  sister  and
             those family members  live  there  now.   He  will  not  be  a
             stranger to the culture or  the  language.   He  can  maintain
             contact with people in the UK in just the same way he has been
             able to maintain contact with  his  family  (his  brother)  in
             Venezuela to date, although we recognise that separation  from
             L in particular, apart from visits she and Mrs P may  make  to
             Venezuela, will hit him hard.  He will return as an adult with
             skills in English and the benefit of a school  education.   We
             also remind ourselves that the  Appellant  alone  has  brought
             about his  current  situation;  he  has  committed  a  serious
             offence despite the assistance he was given by L and Mrs P and
             carried on committing offences  when  assisted  also  by  YOT.
             Although he continues to deny the robbery offence, he  clearly
             knew what he was doing was very wrong and dangerous to  others
             and took the actions  that  he  did  take  in  committing  the
             offences of robbery and  later  unlawful  wounding  with  that
             knowledge.  When we consider the balance that we must,  we  do
             not find that the deportation prejudices the private  life  of
             the Appellant in a manner sufficiently serious to amount to  a
             breach of the fundamental right protected by Article 8.  There
             is here no Exception within Section 33 of UKBA."

     2. Discusssion

30. First, Mr Joseph submitted that the Tribunal had  been  wrong  to  rely
    upon the pre-sentence report  prepared  by  the  Waltham  Forest  Youth
    Offending Team on 21 February 2011.  He submitted that in relying  upon
    the report's conclusion (at para 15(xx)) that the appellant presented a
    "medium  risk  of  reoffending  and  a  medium  risk  of  harm  to  the
    community", the Tribunal had failed  to  take  into  account  that  the
    report was over two years old.  Mr Joseph did not submit  that  it  was
    wrong for the Tribunal to have regard to it but it was  wrong  to  take
    its views at face value given the passage of time.

31. The difficulty with this submission is that no more recent evidence was
    placed before the Tribunal.  It was, of course, open to  the  appellant
    to present evidence  that  sought  to  demonstrate  that  his  risk  of
    offending was other than stated in the PSR.  The Tribunal  referred  to
    the letter from Sue Edwards, a Youth Justice Officer,  dated  19  April
    2013 concerning the appellant's circumstances, as she saw them,  during
    her dealings with him from July 2010 until June 2011.  (The latter date
    must be an error since  the  appellant  was  sentenced  to  six  years'
    detention on 3 March 2011).  It was, of course, during this  time  that
    the appellant was convicted of the s.20 offence.  Mr Joseph was  unable
    to point to any material which had been placed  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal in relation to the  appellant's  conduct,  behaviour  and  any
    progress during his detention.  In these circumstances, it was properly
    open to the Tribunal to accept the PSR report's finding as to his  risk
    of reoffending.

32. Secondly. Mr Joseph also submitted that  in  taking  into  account  the
    appellant's s.20 offence committed whilst he was on bail for the  index
    offence, the Tribunal failed to have regard to the circumstances  which
    led to that offence.  That is unsustainable.  The offence is dealt with
    on the third page of the PSR as follows:

         "Through further discussion, [the appellant] informed me  that  the
         circumstances surrounding the wounding with intent matter (sic)  he
         was  at  a  family  gathering.   This  was  at  a  time  when   his
         relationship with his father was particularly volatile and  he  got
         into an argument with a relative who got intense and  he  assaulted
         the relative by biting the man on his face.  The injuries  required
         stitches.   [The  appellant]  informed  me  that  he  was   heavily
         inebriated at the time."

33. In para 15(ix), the Tribunal made specific reference to the PSR and the
    circumstances of this offence.  It is simply untenable to suggest  that
    the Tribunal did not have well in mind the circumstances which  led  to
    the appellant's conviction for the serious violence offence under  s.20
    of the Offences Against the Person Act  1861,  including  that  he  was
    "heavily inebriated" at the time.

34. Thirdly, Mr Joseph submitted that the Tribunal had been wrong  to  rely
    on the PSR in concluding that the appellant had "not shown remorse" for
    the offence and "continues to deny  his  offending".   This  submission
    also fails in the face of no reliable evidence being placed before  the
    Tribunal that the appellant's attitude has changed since the  PSR.   It
    is not clear whether the appellant expressed any remorse  in  his  oral
    evidence before the First-tier Tribunal.  But even if he did, which  is
    doubtful, the Tribunal took a dim  view  of  the  appellant  whom  they
    described in para 15(xv) as: "a reluctant witness and one who  did  not
    always tell us the truth."

35. Fourthly, Mr Joseph submitted that  the  Tribunal  had  also  erred  in
    finding that the appellant  had  maintained  ties  with  Venezuela,  in
    particular that he was in contact with his brother and that  he  wished
    to renew contact with his mother  who  lived  there.   The  latter,  Mr
    Joseph submitted, was again based on the PSR.  I do not understand  why
    it is said that the PSR is unreliable in  respect  of  the  appellant's
    intention to renew contact with his  mother.   There  was  no  evidence
    before the Tribunal to which Mr Joseph directed my attention  that  the
    appellant's intention had changed since he has been in  detention.   In
    any event, as I have already referred to, the Tribunal simply  did  not
    (having heard his evidence) consider the appellant  to  be  a  reliable
    witness.  At para 15(vi) they stated:

          "... it was clear to us that the appellant was seeking to minimise
         his connection with Venezuela and his family there with a  view  to
         'pulling the wool over our eyes'."

36. The Tribunal had the advantage of seeing the appellant and hearing  him
    give evidence.  There is no conceivable  legal  basis  for  undermining
    this finding  based  upon  their  assessment  of  the  appellant.   The
    Tribunal was entitled to find that the appellant  had  maintained  (and
    wished to further) his links with his family in Venezuela  despite  the
    fact that he had lived in the UK since 2003.   His  brother  had  lived
    here previously before being himself deported to Venezuela.

37. Fifthly, Mr Joseph challenged the Tribunal's finding in  para  33  that
    apart from his  relationship  with  his  stepsister  and  his  wish  to
    continue his sports studies: "The appellant's private life  in  the  UK
    appears to be of a shallow nature".  Mr Joseph  drew  my  attention  to
    evidence at pages 19 and 21 et seq relating to the appellant's life  in
    the UK and supporting letters.  Mr Joseph submitted that the  appellant
    had lived here for eight years before  being  detained  and  had  fully
    integrated into the UK.

38. The Tribunal dealt with the appellant's private life in the latter part
    of para 33 of its determination.  Although  describing,  with  the  two
    exceptions, the appellant's private life to be "shallow", the  Tribunal
    commented that he could maintain contact with his friends and family in
    the UK  and  particularly  recognised  that  his  separation  from  his
    stepsister (with whom he had a close relationship) and his  stepmother,
    "will hit him hard".   The  Tribunal  clearly  had  in  mind  that  the
    appellant had lived in the UK since the age of 10 and that "some of his
    formative years were spent here".  In my judgment, it  cannot  be  said
    that the Tribunal erred in its assessment of the scope  and  nature  of
    the appellant's private life in the UK.

39. Finally, Mr Joseph submitted that the Tribunal's error in treating  the
    appellant as being subject to the automatic deportation  provisions  of
    the 2007 Act had tainted its assessment of proportionality under Art 8.
    As I understood Mr Joseph's submission it  was  that,  in  effect,  the
    Tribunal had necessarily given improper weight to the  public  interest
    because, treating the appeal as one governed  by  the  UK  Borders  Act
    2007, the Tribunal will have had in mind the  legislative  dictate  set
    out in s.32(4) of the 2007 Act  that  "the  deportation  of  a  foreign
    criminal is conducive to the public good."

40. In my judgment, Mr Joseph's submissions on this issue simply do not hit
    their target.  It is abundantly clear that the legislative  dictate  in
    s.32(4) has nothing to do with the application of Art 8  itself.   That
    is made clear by the initial phrase in  s.32(4)  that  the  legislative
    dictate applies:

         "for the purposes of section 3(5)(a) of the Immigration Act 1971".

41. It is, of course,  clear  also  that  the  deportation  of  a  "foreign
    criminal" is "conducive to  the  public  good"  even  if  the  "foreign
    criminal" cannot be deported because that  would  breach  a  Convention
    right, such as Art 8 and so the individual would fall with in Exception
    1 in s.33(2) of the 2007 Act.  Section 33(7) makes this clear  when  it
    states that:

         "The application of an Exception -

         .....

         (b)  results in it being assumed neither that  the  deportation  of
             the person concerned is conducive to the public good nor  that
             it is not conducive to the  public  good;  but  section  32(4)
             applies despite the application of  Exception  1  or  4."  (my
             emphasis)

42. The point, however, remains that, even in a case where an  individual's
    deportation  would  breach  Art  8,  the  prerequisite  for  making   a
    deportation order under s.3(5)(a) of the 1971 Act  nevertheless  exists
    and, as s.33(7)(a) states, the application of an  Exception  "does  not
    prevent the making of a deportation  order".   The  order  cannot  have
    effect or be enforced if it would breach Art 8 of the ECHR to deport an
    individual but there is, nevertheless, a lawful basis  for  making  the
    order under ss. 3(5)(a) and 5 of the Immigration Act 1971.

43. In short, therefore, s.32(4) would appear to have no relevance  to  the
    question of whether an individual's deportation would breach Art 8 and,
    in particular,  whether  the  legitimate  aim  of  the  "prevention  of
    disorder or crime" outweighs the individual's right to respect for  his
    or her private and family life.

44. Further, whether a decision to deport an individual is or is not  based
    upon the automatic deportation provisions in the UK Borders  Act  2007,
    it is for the Tribunal (on appeal) to assess the weight to be given  to
    the public interest reflected in  the  individual's  offending  and  to
    weigh that against the individual's rights.

45. Prior to the UK Borders Act 2007, the Court of Appeal in  a  series  of
    cases beginning most prominently with N (Kenya) v SSHD [2004] EWCA  Civ
    1094 set out the facets of the public interest that had to  be  weighed
    against  an  individual's  interest,  both  in  deciding  whether   the
    deportation was in accordance with the  (then)  Immigration  Rules  and
    also in assessing whether  the  individual's  deportation  would  be  a
    disproportionate interference with the right to respect for his  family
    life.  The facets of the public interest were summarised by  Wilson  LJ
    (as he then was) in OH (Serbia) v SSHD [2008] EWCA Civ 694 at  [15]  in
    the following terms:

         "(a) The risk of reoffending is one facet of  the  public  interest
         but, in the case of very serious crimes,  not  the  most  important
         fact.


         (b)  Another important facet is the need to deter foreign nationals
         from committing serious crimes by leading them to understand  that,
         whatever the other circumstances, one consequence of them may  well
         be deportation.


         (c)  A further important facet is the role of a  deportation  order
         as an expression of society's revulsion at serious  crimes  and  in
         building public confidence in the treatment of foreign citizens who
         have committed serious crimes.


         (d)  Primary responsibility for the public interest, whose view  of
         it is likely to be  wider  and  better  informed  than  that  of  a
         tribunal, resides in the  respondent  and  accordingly  a  tribunal
         hearing an appeal against a decision  to  deport  should  not  only
         consider for itself all the  facets  of  the  public  interest  but
         should weigh, as a linked but independent feature, the approach  to
         them adopted by the respondent in the context of the facts  of  the
         case."

46. The subsequent case law of the Court of Appeal  makes  plain  that  the
    public policy factors identified in OH (Serbia) continue  to  apply  in
    automatic deportation cases.

47. RU (Bangladesh) v SSHD [2011] EWCA Civ 651 is an automatic  deportation
    case.  At [30]-[35], Aikens LJ (with whose judgment Longmore and  Elias
    LJJ agreed) summarised the changes brought about by ss.32 and 33 of the
    2007 Act.  At [36] he continued:

         "36. Because, by statute, the deportation of 'foreign criminals' is
             deemed to be  conducive  to  the  public  good,  I  think  the
             constituents of that 'public good' must  continue  to  include
             those particular facets of 'the public interest summarised  by
             Wilson  LJ  in  OH  (Serbia)  and  set  out  at  [33]   above.
             Therefore, if a 'foreign criminal' asserts that removal  by  a
             deportation order pursuant to section 32(5) of the UKBA  would
             be a  disproportionate  interference  with  his  Article  8(1)
             rights, both the SSHD  and  any  reviewing  tribunal  must  be
             obliged to take those public  interest  factors  into  account
             when performing the 'proportionality' balancing exercise."

48. At [37], Aikens LJ addressed two  questions.   First,  what  weight  is
    generally to be attached  to  those  public  interest  factors  in  the
    proportionality exercise; is it the same  or  more  than  was  accorded
    under the pre-UKBA regime?;  and  secondly,  whether  any  separate  or
    additional weight was to be given  to  the  Secretary  of  State's  own
    judgment on the weight of those factors  as  expressed  in  a  decision
    letter.  Aikens LJ continued at [37] and [38]:

         "37. .... Both questions were raised, but not answered,  by  Sedley
             LJ sitting in the Upper Tribunal, in his judgment  in  SSHD  v
             BK.  The questions were also  raised  by  this  court  in  its
             recent decision in AP (Trinidad and Tobago) v SSHD.   In  that
             case counsel for the SSHD had not argued that  the  effect  of
             the 2008 Act was that greater weight had to be  given  to  the
             public interest factors in cases where  a  'foreign  criminal'
             resisted a deportation order on  grounds  that  removal  would
             infringe his Article 8 rights under the ECHR.  Nor did counsel
             for the appellant (Mr Chirico) argue that the public  interest
             factors in favour of deportation  summarised  in  OH  (Serbia)
             were now less important in such cases.

         38.  At [44] of his judgment in AP (Trinidad and  Tobago)  Carnwath
             LJ said:

                  '... Although the  executive's  policy  as  such  as  been
                  superseded, it is readily inferred that the policy factors
                  identified in OH (Serbia) were impliedly endorsed  and  if
                  anything   reinforced,   by   Parliament's   intervention.
                  Indeed, as  I  have  said,  Parliamentary  endorsement  is
                  arguably a matter which should be taken  into  account  in
                  giving greater weight to such  factors  when  drawing  the
                  balance of  proportionality  under  Article  8.   Although
                  [counsel for the SSHD] did not so argue, it seems a little
                  surprising  (if  she  is  right)  that   this   apparently
                  definitive statement by Parliament has made no  difference
                  in practice, at least where any form of private or  family
                  life is involved'."

49. At [39], whilst recognising that it was not necessary  to  resolve  the
    question in RU, Aikens LJ stated that:

         "I respectfully agree with the view expressed by  Carnwath  LJ  ...
         but these questions will be open for argument if relevant in future
         cases."

50. At [40], Aikens LJ reiterated that the policy factors identified in  OH
    (Serbia) continued to apply in automatic deportation  proceedings.   He
    said this:

         "40. At all events on an  appeal  from  the  SSHD's  decision  that
             section 32(5) applies in a case where the  'foreign  criminal'
             has argued that  removal  pursuant  an  automatic  deportation
             order  would  infringe  his  Article  8(1)   rights   and   be
             disproportionate,  the  tribunal  or  court   concerned   must
             recognise and give due weight to all the public policy factors
             identified in OH (Serbia).  It must acknowledge that the  SSHD
             is entitled, indeed obliged, to give due weight to them.   The
             tribunal or court must also acknowledge and give due weight to
             them when drawing the 'proportionality balance' under  Article
             8(2)."

51. Those  passages  may  appear  to  give  some  support  to  Mr  Joseph's
    submissions that, in principle, the weight to be attached to the public
    interest factor is greater in  an  automatic  deportation  appeal  when
    carrying  out  the  balancing  exercise  inherent  in  proportionality.
    Aikens LJ, nevertheless, left the matter open for future argument.

52. As I have already indicated, it is perhaps not immediately apparent why
    s.32(4), limited as it is  in  its  application  to  s.3(5)(a)  of  the
    Immigration  Act  1971,  has  any  direct  relevance   when   assessing
    proportionality under Art  8.   In  any  event,  [40]  of  Aikens  LJ's
    judgment emphasises, in an automatic deportation case,  the  facets  of
    public policy identified in OH (Serbia) remain the  essential  features
    of an assessment of the legitimate aim of preventing disorder or  crime
    under Art 8.2.  (Subsequently, the basis  principles  and  approach  in
    automatic deportation cases were drawn together by the  Upper  Tribunal
    in Masih (deportation - public interest -  basic  principles)  Pakistan
    [2012] UKUT 00046 (IAC) at [11]).

53. I must refer to two further decisions of  the  Court  of  Appeal.   The
    first is Rocky Gurung v SSHD [2012] EWCA Civ 62 (Rix and McFarlane  LJJ
    and Sir Stephen Sedley).   Sir Stephen Sedley (delivering the  judgment
    of the Court of Appeal), having cited  [37]-[39]  of  the  judgment  of
    Aikens LJ in RU (Bangladesh), addressed at [11]-[12] the two  questions
    posed by Aikens LJ as follows:

         "11. ... The answers, in our view, are those advanced  or  accepted
             by Ms Giovannetti and Mr Chirico in RU and by  Charles  Bourne
             (for the Home Secretary) and Zane Malik (for Mr Gurung) in the
             present case.  The public interest is not only to  be  treated
             as by definition  served,  subject  to  the  United  Kingdom's
             international obligations, by deporting foreign criminals;  it
             is  also  among  the  factors   capable   of   affecting   the
             proportionality of deporting them if this arises.  This  means
             that, while the public interest  in  deportation  has  already
             been established by legislation, its content and extent in the
             particular case have to be separately evaluated, initially  by
             the  Home  Secretary  and  thereafter  if  necessary  by   the
             tribunal, if the proportionality  of  deportation  comes  into
             question.

         12.   The  tribunal  should  accordingly  entertain   both   sides'
             submissions on the public interest, along with  such  elements
             as the nature and gravity of the offence; but  the  fact  that
             one estimation  of  the  public  interest  (or  of  any  other
             element) is the Home Secretary's, whether leaning  towards  or
             against  deportation  in  the  particular  case,  commands  no
             additional weight.  To let it do so - as counsel for the  Home
             Secretary have implicitly recognised - would be to  upset  the
             equal footing on which  the  Crown  and  the  individual  come
             before this country's tribunals and  courts,  not  least  when
             Parliament has  already  decided  where,  other  things  being
             equal, the public interest lies.  It would also impinge on the
             independence and impartiality of the tribunal by requiring  it
             to defer to one side's judgment of a material question."

54. Rocky Gurung was an automatic deportation case.   Sir  Stephen  Sedley,
    delivering the judgment  of  the  Court  of  Appeal,  agreed  with  the
    submission that had been made by both Counsel in RU and by both Counsel
    in Rocky Gurung that, first the public interest factors  summarised  in
    OH (Serbia) were no less important in  automatic  deportation  appeals;
    secondly that the effect of s.32(4) of the 2007 Act made "no difference
    in practice" in assessing proportionality under Art 8.2; and thirdly, a
    Tribunal was required to consider, for itself, the "content and extent"
    of the public interest having regard to  the  public  interest  factors
    summarised in OH (Serbia).

55. Finally, there is the case of AM v SSHD [2012]  EWCA  Civ  1634  (Ward,
    Elias and Pitchford LJJ).  That case was also one  concerned  with  the
    automatic deportation provisions in the 2007 Act.  Pitchford LJ, having
    cited earlier Court of Appeal case  law  such  as  N  (Kenya),  and  RU
    (Bangladesh), continued at [29]:

         " ... It follows, as Sir Stephen Sedley  said  at  paragraph  9  of
         Gurung  v  SSHD  [2012]  EWCA  Civ  62  when  commenting  upon   RU
         (Bangladesh) that there is no longer any requirement upon the  Home
         Secretary to form her own view of the public interest in  deporting
         a foreign criminal who is sentenced to  not  less  than  12  months
         imprisonment.  She is bound by section 32 (subject to 33)  to  make
         an order for deportation when the  conditions  of  section  32  are
         satisfied."

56. Citing [9] of Sir Stephen Sedley's judgment  in  Gurung,  Pitchford  LJ
    recognised that the effect of s.32(4) was to provide the  lawful  basis
    (without the need for specific consideration by the Secretary of State)
    for the making of a deportation order as being conducive to the  public
    good under s.3(5)(a) and s.5 of the Immigration Act 1971.

57. Having cited, without dissent, [11] and [12] of the judgment in  Gurung
    (which I set out above), Pitchford LJ set  out  the  facets  of  public
    policy in Wilson LJ's  judgment  at  [16]  in  OH  (Serbia).   At  [31]
    Pitchford LJ continued as follows:

         "31. While the landscape  for  qualification  for  deportation  has
             changed in consequence of the 2007  Act  by  the  creation  of
             'automatic deportation' of 'foreign criminals',  it  seems  to
             me, in agreement with Aikens LJ in  RU  (Bangladesh)  and  Sir
             Stephen  Sedley  in  Gurung,  inevitable  that  in   measuring
             proportionality  the  public  interest  in  deterrence  is   a
             material and necessary consideration.  The public interest  is
             an important component of the balancing exercise  required  to
             test proportionality (for the  purpose  of  section  33(2)(a))
             whether or not the Secretary of State expressly says so in her
             decision letter or in the presenting officer's submissions  to
             a tribunal.  It is  an  indelible  feature  of  the  balancing
             exercise that the decision maker weighs  the  consequences  of
             deportation against the full import of the legitimate  aim  to
             be achieved."

58. Pitchford LJ continued  to  recognise  the  centrality  of  the  public
    interest facets summarised in OH (Serbia) and the need for the Tribunal
    to assess those facets and to weigh them against the  individual  right
    to respect for his or her private and family life.

59. In a concurring  judgment,  Elias  LJ  (agreeing  with  Pitchford  LJ's
    reasons)  adopted  the  same  approach.   At  [42]  he  emphasised  the
    continuing importance  of  N  (Kenya)  and  OH  (Serbia)  in  automatic
    deportation cases:

         "42.  The  decisions  of  this  court  in  N  (Kenya),  OH  and  RU
             (Bangladesh) all emphasise the importance of a tribunal giving
             full weight to these different aspects of the public  interest
             in the proportionality assessment."

60. Elias LJ went on to analyse the approach of the First-tier Tribunal  in
    that appeal to Article 8 applying  the  principles  enunciated  by  the
    Strasbourg Court in its leading  case  law  of  Boultif  v  Switzerland
    [2002] 33 EHRR 117; �ner v Netherlands [2007] INLR  273  and  Maslov  v
    Austria [2008] ECHR 508.

61. Ward LJ in  his  concurring  judgment  agreed  with  the  reasoning  of
    Pitchford and Elias LJJ.

62. Drawing the threads of the Court of Appeal's case law  together,  there
    is no basis for the premise of Mr Joseph's submission that the Tribunal
    in this appeal  must  have  approached  the  balancing  exercise  under
    Article 8.2 wrongly because the legislative dictate in s.32(4) resulted
    in the Tribunal (necessarily) placing improper weight upon  the  public
    interest arising in from the appellant's offending.  The case  law,  in
    particular Gurung, provides  no  basis  for  such  a  submission.   The
    correct approach remains that summarised in OH (Serbia) and requires  a
    Tribunal to evaluate for itself the "content and extent" of the  public
    interest.

63. In this appeal, that is precisely what the Tribunal did.  I  am  in  no
    doubt that the Tribunal carried out the  balancing  exercise  properly.
    The Tribunal applied the five-stage approach in Razgar [2004] UKHL  27.
    At para 32 the Tribunal concluded that Art 8.1 was engaged on the basis
    that the appellant's deportation interfered with his "private life" and
    concluded that that interference was in accordance with the law and for
    a legitimate aim.  None of that is challenged.

64. The Tribunal set out [15] of Wilson LJ's judgment  in  OH  (Serbia)  at
    para 31 of its determination.  The  Tribunal  also  set  out,  at  some
    length, extracts from the relevant Strasbourg decisions in  �ner  (para
    28), Maslov (para 30) and Balogun v UK [2013] 56 EHRR 3 (at  para  29),
    the latter repeating  the  so-called  Boultif  criteria  and  additions
    thereto made by the Strasbourg Court in �ner.

65. In para  33,  the  Tribunal  dealt  with  the  serious  nature  of  the
    appellant's offending and noted, as they were entitled to do, that  the
    appellant had committed further serious offences whilst on bail for the
    index offence.  The Tribunal made a number of findings, none  of  which
    can successfully be challenged,  concerning  the  appellant's  lack  of
    remorse and his continued denial of the offending.  The  Tribunal  also
    considered the appellant's circumstances in the UK, in  particular  his
    relationship with his stepsister and stepmother.  The  Tribunal  found,
    and  again  this  finding  is  unassailable,  that  the  appellant  had
    maintained contact with his brother in Venezuela and that  it  was  his
    wish to renew contact with his mother who lived  there.   The  Tribunal
    noted that the appellant's index offence of robbery for  which  he  was
    sentenced to six years' detention, was a "very serious  offence"  which
    had been followed by a "further serious offence of  unlawful  wounding"
    and there was a background of offences of violence and dishonesty.  The
    Tribunal was well aware that the appellant had come to the  UK  at  the
    age of 10, that he had spent some of his formative years here  but  had
    maintained  cultural  links,  having  lived  with  "Venezuelan   family
    members" in the UK.  The Tribunal had well in mind that the appellant's
    offending had  occurred  as  a  youth  but  noted  that  the  offending
    continued "as he approached adulthood".  The Tribunal  was  well  aware
    that the appellant had indefinite leave to remain  which  he  had  been
    granted in May 2008.  At para  30,  the  Tribunal  cites  the  relevant
    passage in the Strasbourg Court judgment in Maslov (namely [75]) that:

         "In short, the Court considers that for a settled migrant  who  has
         lawfully spent all or the major part of his or  her  childhood  and
         youth in the host country very  serious  reasons  are  required  to
         justify expulsion.  This is  all  the  more  so  where  the  person
         concerned committed the offences underlying the  expulsion  measure
         as a juvenile." (my emphasis)

66. In this appeal, the appellant  could  only  establish  that  he  had  a
    private life in the UK.  It is not  suggested  that  his  relationships
    gave rise to "family life".  The proper approach is set out  in  Maslov
    at [71]-[74] which was  cited  by  the  Tribunal  at  para  30  of  its
    determination.  At [71], the Strasbourg Court said this:

         "In a case like the present, where the person to be  expelled  s  a
         young adult who has not yet  founded  a  family  of  his  own,  the
         relevant criteria are:


         -    the nature and seriousness of the  offence  committed  by  the
             applicant;


         -    the length of the applicant's stay in the country  from  which
             he or she is to be expelled;


         -    the time elapsed since  the  offence  was  committed  and  the
             applicant's conduct during that period;


         -    the solidarity of social, cultural and family  ties  with  the
             host country and with the country of destination."

67. In setting out its findings at para 15 and in assessing proportionality
    in para 33 of its determination, the Tribunal  fully  considered  these
    factors and the Strasbourg Court's view  that  "very  serious  reasons"
    were required to justify expulsion.  Mr Joseph did  not,  in  his  oral
    submissions, argue that the Tribunal failed to apply  the  approach  in
    Maslov or that its conclusion  in  assessing  proportionality  was  not
    properly open to the Tribunal on the basis  of  irrationality.   Given,
    however, that that is suggested in general  terms  in  para  7  of  the
    grounds, and given that this appeal concerns the deportation of a young
    adult who has lived in  the  UK  for  ten  years,  I  have  thought  it
    appropriate to look beyond Mr Joseph's submissions in this regard.

68. For the reasons I have given above, I am satisfied  that  the  Tribunal
    fully took into account the appellant's circumstances, both in  the  UK
    and if deported and, having regard to the nature and seriousness of his
    offending even though committed as a juvenile, the Tribunal did not err
    in law in reaching its finding that the appellant's deportation  was  a
    proportionate interference with his private life in the UK.

Decision

69. The First-tier Tribunal's decision to dismiss the  appeal  stands.  Any
    error of law by the Tribunal  was  not  material  to  its  decision  to
    dismiss the appellant's appeal in reliance upon Art 8 of the ECHR.

70. The appellant's appeal to the Upper Tribunal is dismissed.
