                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

The Appellant

 1. For the purposes of this appeal I shall refer to the  parties  as  they
    were before the First Tier Tribunal that is Mr Silva as  the  appellant
    and the Secretary of State as the respondent.

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Sri Lanka born on 21st December 1991  and
    he appealed against the refusal of the Entry  Clearance  Officer  dated
    8th May 2013 to grant him a sports' visit visa.

 3. His application was refused on the basis of paragraphs 46 M and 320  of
    the Immigration Rules.   The objections were set out in a full one page
    decision by the Entry Clearance Officer (ECO), who  recorded  that  the
    appellant had submitted with the application  two  letters  from  Tissa
    Central College dated 27th  January  2013  which  stated  that  he  was
    attached to the school as an assistant cricket coach and  that  he  had
    been granted leave to travel to the UK.  He submitted a  document  from
    Tissa College  claiming  that  he  received  an  income  of  Rs  20,000
    (ï¿½104.17) per month from Tissa  College.     Verification  checks  were
    made and the employment documents were found to be false.

 4. The ECO refused the application further to Paragraph 320 (7A) and noted
    that future applications may also be refused. The ECO was not satisfied
    in view of the false documents  submitted  that  the  appellant  was  a
    genuine visitor.

 5. The ECO recorded that the  right  of  appeal  was  limited  to  grounds
    referred to in Section 84(1)(c)  of  the  Nationality  Immigration  and
    Asylum  Act  2002  that  is  to  human   rights   grounds   or   racial
    discrimination grounds.

 6. First Tier Tribunal Judge Hussain allowed  the  appeal  on  20th  March
    2014.

 7. Application for permission to appeal was made on  the  basis  that  the
    Judge correctly directed himself as to  his  jurisdiction  namely  that
    because the appellant was not a family visitor his right of appeal  was
    limited to human rights grounds but nevertheless he  was  of  the  view
    that the appellant had succeeded under the Immigration Rules. This  was
    an error of law.

 8. Permission to appeal was granted to the respondent by FTT Judge Landes.

Conclusions

 9. Mr Nath submitted that the appellant had a right of appeal but  it  was
    limited only to human rights grounds.  The  reasoning  in  relation  to
    Article 8 was insufficient and if there was strength  to  the  ties  it
    must be shown in greater detail.

10. Mr Waters gave evidence on behalf of the appellant and  confirmed  that
    he had no original of the further letter submitted from  Tissa  College
    dated 21st May 2013 confirming that the appellant was employed by  that
    college.  He had been informed by the appellant that he was employed by
    the College.  He now had an alternative job but  at  the  time  he  was
    working as a cricket coach.

11. Mr Waters stated that the last time he saw the appellant was  in  2012.
    The appellant had stayed with Mr Waters and his partner  from  June  to
    September 2010 and Mr Waters and his partner  had  had  two  subsequent
    holidays with him in Sri Lanka.  His partner's son had accompanied them
    on the first holiday (the last being in 2012).   Both  holidays  lasted
    for a couple of weeks. The appellant had his mother  two  brothers  and
    younger sister in Sri  Lanka  and  was  working.   He  had  no  medical
    conditions.

12. The judge correctly pointed out that the ECO  refused  the  application
    further to  paragraph  320  (7A)  and  that  the  verification  reports
    regarding the false documents had not been submitted to  the  Tribunal.
    The First Tier Tribunal Judge also correctly pointed out that the right
    of appeal was limited to human rights grounds and it is right that  the
    appellant  appealed  on  human  rights  grounds.   However  the   judge
    proceeded to allow the appeal under the Immigration Rules  [22]  having
    pointed out that the grounds of appeal were restricted.  It  may  be  a
    factor to take into account that the allegation of false documents  was
    not substantiated but it was an error of law to determine the appeal on
    the basis of the immigration rules.

13. The fact is that  the  jurisdiction  of  the  appeal  was  limited.   I
    therefore remake the decision on the basis of the human rights appeal.

14. The grounds for refusal under the Immigration Rules are  mandatory  and
    there is no appeal in this jurisdiction.

15. The question is whether the Article 8 is even  engaged.  As  stated  in
    paragraph 54 of  Patel and ors  v SSHD [2013] UKSC 72

    'The most  authoritative  guidance  on  the  correct  approach  of  the
    Tribunal to Article 8 remains that of Lord Bingham in  Huang.   In  the
    passage cited by Burnton LJ Lord Bingham observed that  the  rules  are
    designed to identify those to whom 'on  grounds  such  as  kinship  and
    family relationship and dependence leave to enter should be granted and
    that such rules to be administratively workable require that a line  be
    drawn somewhere'.

16. First this is not an application further to Part 8 of  the  Immigration
    Rules and the question of the  necessity  of  having  good  grounds  to
    consider the matter outside the rules is not  relevant.   However  when
    posing the questions raised in Razgar v SSHD [2004] UKHL 27.  I am  not
    persuaded  that  a  right  to  a  family  or  private  life  has   been
    established. There is no claim to any family  relationship  here.   The
    connection is through the cricket team of which Mr Waters  a  committee
    member.  I can accept that the appellant may be a  fine  cricketer  and
    that a firm friendship has been formed but that does  not  elevate  the
    relationship to one which is  protected  by  article  8.  There  is  no
    dependency and there was none at the date  of  the  decision  which  is
    relevant for my purposes. The appellant has his own family in Sri Lanka
    and the last time the appellant and  Sponsor  met  was  in  2012.   The
    sponsor and his partner looked after the appellant in  2010  and  since
    then have spent two short  holidays  in  Sri  Lanka.   The  appellant's
    family life is in Sri Lanka and at the time of the decision his private
    life was also in Sri Lanka.  He has no medical conditions.

17. Patel concluded that the right  to  a  private  life  did  not  extend,
    without other relevant circumstances,  to  protection  of  a  right  to
    education and if that is the case it must be so for the right  to  play
    cricket however important it is to some sections of the community.

18. I can agree that whether  the  appellant  had  his  application  fairly
    refused by the ECO on the documentation could be a  matter  taken  into
    the proportionality exercise (I note that Mr Waters did  not  have  the
    original documentation and was relying on information supplied  to  him
    by the appellant) but this stage is not reached in this appeal.     The
    first stage of Razgar needs to be satisfied as to whether there is  any
    private life engaged. In this case, I find it was not.

19. The First-tier Tribunal Judge made an error of law  and  I  remake  the
    decision and dismiss the appeal.


Order

There is no appeal under the Immigration Rules
The appellant's appeal is dismissed on Human Rights grounds
