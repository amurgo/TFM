Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr C Avery, Senior Home Officer Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr T N Paramjorthy instructed by S Satha & Co
                    Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This appeal comes back before me as a resumed hearing  following  an
       earlier hearing on 11th September 2015.  For the reasons set out  in
       my decision promulgated on 5th November 2015 I found an error of law
       in the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Moore.


    2. The appellant in these proceedings is the Secretary of State  but  I
       continue to refer to the parties as they were before the  First-tier
       Tribunal.


    3. To summarise the background, the  appeal  against  the  respondent's
       decision to refuse the appellant's application for leave  to  remain
       in the UK on the basis of her  relationship,  and  on  Private  life
       grounds, was allowed  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   Although  the
       decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Moore was set aside, a  number
       of findings of fact were preserved, as set out in my  error  of  law
       decision at [33].   For  convenience  I  reproduce  those  preserved
       findings as follows:


              a. [25] The appellant has established a  considerable  family
                 life with her husband  in  the  United  Kingdom.  She  has
                 resided in the United Kingdom for nearly six years, whilst
                 her husband has been in the United Kingdom for nearly nine
                 years. They married each other on 9th  November  2008  and
                 have been living together in the same  household  for  the
                 nearly six years that have passed. Since April  2014  they
                 both lived together in a mortgaged property that is  owned
                 by the appellant's husband.


              b. [28] The husband  of  the  appellant  entered  the  United
                 Kingdom in December 2005 and  claimed  asylum  within  one
                 week of his arrival. Through no fault of  his  own,  there
                 was a substantial delay in his claim  and  ultimately  the
                 husband was  granted  discretionary  leave  to  remain  on
                 Article 8 grounds and in  light  of  the  delay,  on  28th
                 February 2013.


              c. [28] The appellant has no family of her own living in  the
                 United Kingdom, however, her husband has two  sisters  who
                 live in the United Kingdom  whom  the  appellant  and  her
                 husband see regularly three or four  times  a  month.  The
                 father of the husband also lives in the United Kingdom.


              d. [29] Both the appellant and her husband are in  employment
                 in the United Kingdom.  The appellant has been working  as
                 an accounts assistant eighteen hours per week  on  a  part
                 time basis for the past five  years,  whilst  her  husband
                 works for the same company as an IT consultant on  a  full
                 time  basis  and  has  done  so  since  he   was   granted
                 discretionary  leave  and  became  entitled  to  work.  He
                 receives a significant salary of  approximately  �42,  499
                 per annum whilst the appellant has  an  annual  income  of
                 approximately �8,080.


              e. [35] The relationship developed between the appellant  and
                 her husband was done so at a time when they  were  in  the
                 United Kingdom lawfully.


    4. At the resumed hearing neither party  sought  to  disagree  with  my
       provisional view as  to  the  findings  of  fact  that  were  to  be
       preserved.  Directions were issued to the parties in advance of  the
       hearing before me, requiring the  parties  to  file  and  serve  any
       further evidence to be relied upon no later than 14 days before  the
       hearing.  No further evidence was filed and served by the  appellant
       in accordance with  the  directions  made.   At  the  start  of  the
       hearing, Mr Paramjorthy made an application to  admit  new  evidence
       not previously relied on.  He  sought  permission  to  rely  upon  a
       letter dated 27th November 2015 signed by the appellant's father-in-
       law  and  a  statement  of  the  appellant  comprising  of  8  short
       paragraphs signed by her on 30th November 2015.  I was also provided
       with a letter issued by  the  University  College  London  Hospital,
       Ultrasound Screening Unit following an examination of the  appellant
       on 16th November 2015.  The letter confirms that  the  appellant  is
       now pregnant and gives a gestational age of 12  weeks  and  2  days,
       with an expected date of delivery on 28th May 2016.   On  behalf  of
       the respondent, Mr Avery did  not  object  to  the  documents  being
       adduced by the appellant, and so I admitted them as evidence  before
       me.


    5. The letter from the appellant's father-in-law confirms that he lives
       with his son and the appellant  at  their  property,  and  that  the
       appellant looks after him "like my own daughter".  He states that he
       has problems walking properly following an accident in Sri Lanka and
       that because of a knee problem he  was  unable  to  attend  to  give
       evidence before me.  He summaries that it  would  be  heart-breaking
       for the appellant and her husband to be split apart from each  other
       and they:


             "..have strong tie to friends and family here  and  they  work
             together and have worked very hard to build up their life here
             in  the  UK.  They  are  both  kind  and  genuine  people   of
             exceptional character..."


    6. The appellant's witness  statement  signed  on  30th  November  2015
       confirms that she is now three months pregnant and that her  husband
       is the father.  She states that her  husband  cannot  and  will  not
       return to Sri Lanka and the thought of  her  being  removed  to  Sri
       Lanka is destroying them.  She states that they have  established  a
       considerable private and family life here in the UK, and to give  up
       everything   and   return   to   Sri   Lanka,   seems   unfair   and
       disproportionate.  She is distraught at the thought of  leaving  the
       UK, and she confirms the very special bond that  she  has  with  her
       father-in-law, who relies upon her for moral support.


    7. Mr Paramjorthy indicated that no further oral  evidence  was  to  be
       called  on  behalf  of  the  appellant  and  I  proceeded  to   hear
       submissions from the parties which I summarise below.


    8. Mr Paramjorthy concedes that the appellant  is  unable  to  meet  the
       requirements  of  Appendix  FM  and  paragraph   276ADE(1)   of   the
       Immigration Rules.  He accepts that the correct test is  set  out  at
       paragraph [29] of my error of law decision, and  submits  that  there
       are exceptional circumstances in this case to support the  Article  8
       claim in circumstances where the appellant cannot succeed  under  the
       immigration rules.  He identifies those exceptional factors as  being
       the husband's long residence in the UK, and the procedural delays  in
       deciding his case before the grant of discretionary leave  to  remain
       was made to him.  Mr Paramjorthy also points to the  history  of  the
       relationship between the appellant and her husband.  They had met and
       married in 2008 and underwent a civil marriage ceremony in 2011,  all
       at a time when they were both in the  UK  lawfully.   Mr  Paramjorthy
       concedes that whilst it is right to say that their immigration status
       at that time was precarious, they were entitled to get on with  their
       lives and they have built a considerable and admirable  private  life
       in the UK.  He submits that neither the appellant nor her husband are
       a burden on the tax-payer and whilst the specified evidence  required
       to establish that the other requirements of the immigration rules are
       met, is not before me, the respondent did not challenge the fact that
       the  appellant  and  her  husband  could  meet  the  maintenance  and
       accommodation requirements.  He submits that when one  considers  all
       matters cumulatively, there are  exceptional  circumstances  in  this
       case to support the Article 8 claim outside of the immigration rules.


    9. On behalf of the respondent, Mr Avery reminds me that the test is one
       of 'exceptionality' and he submits that the test is simply  not  met.
       He submits that the immigration status  of  the  appellant's  husband
       remains precarious and it cannot be said that the grant of indefinite
       leave to remain is a foregone conclusion.  Mr Avery submits there  is
       no evidence to establish any compelling, let alone exceptional reason
       why family life between the appellant and her husband cannot continue
       outside the UK.


 Decision


   10. In reaching my decision, I have had regard to the preserved  findings
       of fact that I have referred to in this decision, together  with  the
       evidence of the appellant and her husband as set out in their witness
       statements before the First-tier Tribunal, and the  further  evidence
       adduced before me at the resumed hearing.


   11. I remind myself of the immigration history of the appellant  and  her
       husband.  The appellant entered the UK on 10th September  2008  as  a
       student. In July 2011, she was granted leave to remain in the UK as a
       student until 24th September 2013.  Shortly after her arrival in  the
       UK, the appellant formed a relationship with her husband, who at  the
       time, was awaiting a decision upon an outstanding asylum  claim.   On
       9th November 2008, the appellant and her husband entered into a Hindu
       marriage ceremony and on 7th  February  2011  they  registered  their
       marriage.  On 28th February 2013, the appellant's husband was granted
       discretionary leave to remain in the  United  Kingdom  on  Article  8
       grounds. On 20th September 2013, the appellant  made  an  application
       for leave to remain in the UK on the basis of  her  marriage  and  on
       Article 8 grounds.


   12. The burden of proof is upon the appellant to show, on the balance  of
       probabilities, that there she has established a family and/or private
       life in the UK and that her removal from the UK as a  result  of  the
       respondent's decision would interfere with those rights. It  is  then
       for  the  respondent  to  justify  any   interference   caused.   The
       respondent's decision must be in accordance with the law and must  be
       a proportionate response in all the circumstances. ?


   13. Where, as here, the appellant does not meet the requirements  of  the
       rules, it is necessary to go on to make an assessment of the  Article
       8 claim.  Article 8 does not entail a general obligation for a  State
       to respect immigrants' choice of the country of their  residence  and
       to authorise family reunion in its territory. In a case that concerns
       family life as well as immigration the extent of the United Kingdom's
       obligations to admit to its territory, relatives of persons  residing
       here vary according to the particular circumstances  of  the  persons
       involved, and the general interest.  Factors to be taken into account
       in this context are the extent to which family  life  is  effectively
       ruptured, the extent of the ties to the  UK  and  whether  there  are
       insurmountable obstacles in the way  of  the  family  living  in  the
       country of origin of one or more  of  them,  and  whether  there  are
       factors of immigration control  or  considerations  of  public  order
       weighing in favour of removal.  Another  important  consideration  is
       whether family life was created at a time when the  persons  involved
       were aware that the immigration status of one of them was  such  that
       the persistence of that family life within the host State would, from
       the outset be precarious. Where this is the case, the removal of  the
       non-national family member would be incompatible with Article 8  only
       in exceptional circumstances.


   14. Looking at the matter through the five  questions  set  out  by  Lord
       Bingham in Razgar [2004] UKHL 27, I would answer  them  therefore  as
       follows;


          a. The appellant has established a considerable family  life  with
             her husband in the United Kingdom.  That is a finding  of  fact
             that has been preserved.


          b. Any interference will have  consequences  of  such  gravity  as
             potentially to engage  the  operation  of  article  8.   It  is
             uncontroversial that removal of the appellant  shall  interfere
             with her and her husband's right to respect for family life. It
             is  now  well  established  that  in  an  Article  8  balancing
             exercise, the rights of all those closely  affected,  not  only
             those of the appellant,  have  to  be  considered.  I  have  no
             hesitation in finding that on  the  facts  of  this  case,  the
             decision to remove the appellant interferes with  her  and  her
             husband's private and family lives, and the interference is  of
             sufficient gravity  potentially  to  engage  the  operation  of
             Article 8. None of that was seriously disputed before me.


          c. Such interference would be in accordance with law. Again,  that
             was not disputed before me.


          d. Such interference is necessary in a democratic society  in  the
             interests of national security, public safety or  the  economic
             wellbeing  of  the  country.   As   Strasbourg   and   domestic
             jurisprudence has consistently emphasized, states are  entitled
             to have regard to  need  for  immigration  control.  It  is  an
             unfortunate reality of life that the  UK  cannot  undertake  to
             allow all members of a family to join together in the UK,  even
             those members who can show emotional and financial  dependency,
             without creating unsupportable burdens.


   15. The real issue  in  this  appeal  is  whether  such  interference  is
       proportionate to the legitimate public end sought to be achieved.   I
       accept that it  is  possible  that  a  case  might  be  found  to  be
       exceptional for the purposes of an assessment under Article  8,  even
       where  the  requirements  of  the  immigration  rules  are  not  met.
       However, the provisions of the rules is relevant to the evaluation of
       proportionality and the fact that the  immigration  rules  cannot  be
       met, is a factor to be taken into account.  In  order  to  show  that
       despite an inability to meet  the  requirements  of  the  immigration
       rules, removal in such a case would nonetheless be  disproportionate,
       the appellant, and the Tribunal must identify other non-standard  and
       particular features of the case, that are of an exceptional nature to
       show that removal would be disproportionate.


   16. In this case, the appellant is unable to meet the requirements of the
       immigration rules because to qualify under  the  rules,  her  husband
       must either be a British Citizen, present and settled in the  UK,  or
       be in the UK with refugee leave or humanitarian protection.  The fair
       balance  required  to  be  struck  pursuant  to  Article  8   between
       individual interests protected by that  provision,  and  the  general
       public interest typically  involves  bringing  into  account  certain
       public interest considerations.  In so doing the respondent  has,  in
       the rules, made provision for partners  of  those  that  are  British
       Citizens present and settled in the UK, or in  the  UK  with  refugee
       leave or humanitarian protection.  The categories identified  in  the
       rules protect the right to a family life with those who have a lawful
       basis upon which they may remain  in  the  UK  indefinitely.   In  my
       judgment the respondent has sought to formulate the  requirements  of
       the relevant Rules in such a way as to  reflect  a  fair  balance  of
       interests under Article 8, and so the Rules themselves  will  provide
       significant   evidence   about   the   relevant    public    interest
       considerations which should be brought into account, when a Court  or
       Tribunal seeks to  strike  the  proper  balance  of  interests  under
       Article 8 in making its own decision. The gap between the rules,  and
       what Article 8 may require in this case is comparatively narrow,  and
       in my judgment, the  weight  to  be  given  to  the  public  interest
       consideration expressed in the rules, is therefore greater.


   17. I must also have regard to ss.117A-117C Nationality, Immigration  and
       Asylum  Act  2002  ("the  2002  Act")  and  in  particular   to   the
       considerations listed in s117B.


              117B: Article 8: public interest considerations applicable  in
       all cases


         (1)  The maintenance of effective immigration controls  is  in  the
             public interest.


             (2)  It is in the public interest, and in  particular  in  the
             interests of the economic well-being of  the  United  Kingdom,
             that persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom
             are able to speak  English,  because  persons  who  can  speak
             English -


                  (a)  are less of a burden on taxpayers, and


                  (b)  are better able to integrate into society.


             (3)  It is in the public interest, and in  particular  in  the
             interests of the economic well-being of  the  United  Kingdom,
             that persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom
             are financially independent, because such persons -


                  (a)  are not a burden on taxpayers, and


                  (b)  are better able to integrate into society.


             (4)  Little weight should be given to -


                  (a)  a private life, or


                  (b)  a relationship formed with a qualifying partner,


                  That is established by a person at a time when the  person
                  is in the United Kingdom unlawfully.


             (5)   Little  weight  should  be  given  to  a  private   life
             established  by  a  person  at  a  time  when   the   person's
             immigration status is precarious.


             .....


   18. In AM (s117B) Malawi [2015] UKUT 260 (IAC) the  Upper  Tribunal  held
       that an appellant can obtain no positive right to a grant of leave to
       remain from either sll7B (2) or (3) of the  2001  Act,  whatever  the
       degree of  their  fluency  in  English,  or  the  strength  of  their
       financial resources.  I acknowledge the employment of  the  appellant
       and her husband, but the fact that they are both  in  employment  and
       not a financial  burden  on  the  taxpayer  gives  the  appellant  no
       positive right to a grant of leave to remain in the UK.


   19. Whilst it is true that the relationship between the appellant and her
       husband developed when  they  were  both  in  the  UK  lawfully,  the
       appellant and her husband entered into their marriage at a time  when
       neither of them had any settled status in the UK.  The appellant  was
       in the UK as a student with limited leave to remain, knowing that she
       might not be permitted to remain in the UK in  the  long  term.   The
       appellant's husband was  awaiting  a  decision  upon  an  outstanding
       asylum claim and neither the appellant nor her husband could have had
       any settled expectation that they would be permitted to remain in the
       UK together, in the long term. Little weight  can  be  given  to  the
       private life  established  by  the  appellant  at  a  time  when  her
       immigration status has been precarious.


   20. In my judgment, the  fact  that  the  appellant's  husband  has  been
       granted discretionary leave to remain in the  UK  cannot  of  itself,
       make it unreasonable for him to return  to  Sri  Lanka.   Whilst  the
       grant to him of discretionary leave to remain in  the  UK  recognises
       the delays in making a decision upon his asylum claim,  there  is  no
       evidence before me that he is at any risk upon return  to  Sri  Lanka
       and could not return to Sri Lanka, either permanently or for a  short
       period whilst the applicant makes an application for entry clearance.
        The previous finding of the First-tier Tribunal that the appellant's
       husband was granted  discretionary  leave  to  remain  on  Article  8
       grounds and in light of the delay, on 28th  February  2013  has  been
       preserved.  I find that any reluctance on the part of the husband  to
       return to Sri Lanka is one of choice  rather  than  an  inability  to
       return.   I  accept  the  submission  made  by  Mr.  Avery  that  the
       immigration status of the appellant's husband remains precarious  and
       it cannot be said that the grant of indefinite leave to remain  is  a
       foregone conclusion.


   21. The appellant states in her witness statement of 10th  February  2014
       that her mother and father still live in Sri Lanka,  and  whilst  she
       has not visited them since her arrival in the  UK,  she  has  contact
       with them about once a month.  I find that the appellant  would  have
       the support of her family in the  event  that  she  returned  to  Sri
       Lanka, whether for a short period to make an  application  for  entry
       clearance as a spouse, or in the long term, should the appellant  and
       her husband decide to return to Sri Lanka.


   22. In my judgment, the appellant's pregnancy and her reliance  upon  the
       support of her husband do  not  amount  to  factors  that  are  of  a
       compelling or exceptional  nature  to  show  that  removal  would  be
       disproportionate on Article 8 grounds.


   23. Overall, I find that the interference to the  appellant's  Article  8
       right to a family and private life is proportionate to the legitimate
       public end sought to be achieved.
