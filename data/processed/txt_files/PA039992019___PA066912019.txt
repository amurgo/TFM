                 Secretary of State for the Home Department
                                                                  Respondent


For the Appellant:     Mr Lee, Counsel instructed by Tuckers Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellants are both nationals of Albania who seek protection in the
    United Kingdom. They are a married couple and their appeals  have  been
    linked for that reason.


 2.  The  First  Appellant  (HT)  has  been  recognised  as  a  victim   of
    trafficking, but has been refused protection on the  grounds  that  she
    does not face a real risk  of  being  trafficked  or  otherwise  facing
    serious harm in Albania. The Respondent further asserts that she could,
    if  necessary,  avail  herself  of  the  protection  of  the   Albanian
    authorities and/or relocate within Albania  without  facing  any  undue
    hardship.

 3. The Second Appellant (AT) asserts that he has a  well-founded  fear  of
    persecution in Albania as a member of a particular social group, viz  a
    family involved in a blood feud.   It is claimed that he and HT married
    against the wishes of  their  respective  parents  and  that  it  later
    emerged that unbeknownst to the Appellants there was in  fact  a  long-
    standing blood feud between the two families. He further asserts a fear
    of harm from the criminals who trafficked his wife. The Respondent  has
    rejected his claim for a want of credibility. The Respondent  wants  to
    deport AT because he is a foreign criminal.

 4. If either appellant succeeded in gaining protection, the  other  relied
    upon Article 8 to submit that it would be disproportionate to refuse to
    grant leave in line.  Before me it was accepted that  the  two  matters
    must be considered in tandem.

 5. These were the matters in issue before the First-tier Tribunal.   In  a
    lengthy and very detailed decision the Tribunal (Judge  Malcolm)  found
    as follows:

              i) That HT  is  a  victim  of  trafficking.  The  'trafficking
                 incident' took place  in  2010.  HT  states  that  she  was
                 abducted from the street in Tirana and  taken  to  a  place
                 where she was held captive and raped.   She understood that
                 the intention was to traffick her for sex work  in  western
                 Europe. She managed to escape and returned to her family.


             ii) The Appellants left Albania  following  that  incident  and
                 unsuccessfully claimed asylum in Belgium after  which  they
                 returned to Albania, remaining there between 2012-2015.

            iii) It is "difficult to accept" that HT remained indoors at her
                 parents home for those three years.

             iv) It is also difficult to accept that she was in those  three
                 years having a lot of problems with her  own  parents,  and
                 facing threats from AT's parents.

              v) HT's stated fear of being re-trafficked does not sit easily
                 with her decision to return to Albania in 2011 (albeit that
                 she states that this was against her  wishes  and  was  the
                 decision of her husband).

             vi) The evidence fell short of establishing that  there  was  a
                 blood feud between  the  Appellants'  respective  families.
                 Although it was clear that relations were  not  good,  both
                 families had at various times given the Appellants  support
                 following their marriage, which was inconsistent  with  the
                 claimed fear now stated.

            vii) The couple and their children could return to  Albania  and
                 live together, away from their families if they wished.  HT
                 would receive appropriate medical treatment.

 6. Both appeals were thereby dismissed.


 7. Permission sought was granted on all  grounds  by  First-tier  Tribunal
    Shimmin on the 18th February 2020.  The appeal was heard remotely  (via
    Skype) with the consent of the parties whose representatives both  made
    oral submissions: this was necessary because of the measures  in  place
    to combat the spread of Covid-19.




    The Challenge


 8. The grounds are that the Tribunal erred in:


           a) Its approach to credibility. In particular the Tribunal  made
              unclear findings and  rejected  admissible  evidence  on  the
              basis that it was hearsay;


           b) Making no  finding  on  the  relevance  of  HT's  trafficking
              experience. It was directly relevant to  her  Article  8  and
              protection claims yet the decision makes no finding on it;

           c) Failing to engage with the expert evidence in respect of HT's
              mental health in  the  context  of  return  of  a  victim  of
              trafficking.


 9. The appeal was opposed on all grounds by the Respondent  who  submitted
    that  any  imprecision  in  the  language  used  by  the  Tribunal  was
    immaterial because the findings were clear and properly  based  on  the
    evidence.  Mr McVeety accepted that what had happened to HT was utterly
    appalling but that the risk of any such harm  re-occurring  had  simply
    not been made out: indeed she had  returned  to  Albania  very  shortly
    after those events and had  remained  in  her  family  home,  the  most
    obvious 'hiding place' imaginable.   It  was  not  disproportionate  to
    expect her to integrate again.  In respect of the expert  the  Tribunal
    did consider the report but was not obliged to accept her conclusions.




    Ground 1: Credibility


10. The standard of proof in protection appeals is  lower  than  the  civil
    standard. It can be expressed as a  "reasonable  likelihood"  or  as  a
    "real risk". This lower standard is applied because of the difficulties
    that asylum seekers face in proving their cases,  and  because  of  the
    grave consequences should decision makers  get  it  wrong.   It  is  an
    established principle of asylum law  that  in  applying  that  standard
    decision makers should be slow to reject evidence on the basis that the
    claimed actions of an individual were inherently  incredible.  In  Y  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2006] EWCA  Civ  1223  Lord
    Justice Keene put it like this:


         25. There seems to me to be very little dispute between the parties
         as to the legal principles applicable  to  the  approach  which  an
         adjudicator, now  known  as  an  immigration  judge,  should  adopt
         towards issues of credibility.  The  fundamental  one  is  that  he
         should be cautious before  finding  an  account  to  be  inherently
         incredible, because there is a considerable risk that  he  will  be
         over influenced by his own views on what is or  is  not  plausible,
         and those views will have inevitably been  influenced  by  his  own
         background in this country and by the customs and ways of  our  own
         society. It is therefore important that he should seek to  view  an
         appellant's account of events, as Mr Singh rightly argues,  in  the
         context of conditions in  the  country  from  which  the  appellant
         comes. The dangers were well described in an article by Sir  Thomas
         Bingham, as he then was, in 1985 in a passage quoted by the IAT  in
         Kasolo v SSHD 13190, the passage being taken  from  an  article  in
         Current Legal Problems. Sir Thomas Bingham said this:


         'An English judge may have, or think that he has, a shrewd idea  of
         how a Lloyds Broker or a Bristol wholesaler, or a  Norfolk  farmer,
         might react in some situation which is canvassed in the course of a
         case but he may, and I think should, feel very much more  uncertain
         about the reactions of a Nigerian merchant,  or  an  Indian  ships'
         engineer, or a Yugoslav banker. Or even,  to  take  a  more  homely
         example, a Sikh shopkeeper trading in Bradford. No judge worth  his
         salt could possibl[y] assume that men of  different  nationalities,
         educations, trades, experience, creeds and temperaments  would  act
         as he might think he would have done or even - which may  be  quite
         different - in accordance with his concept of what a reasonable man
         would have done.'


11. It is also trite that in this jurisdiction we find strange and terrible
    things do happen to people; something may be difficult to  believe  but
    it is nevertheless capable, upon application of the lower standard,  of
    being accepted as true: HK v Secretary of State for the Home Department
    [2006] EWCA Civ 1037.


12. In this case the evidence was shocking. HT, then  a  young  woman,  was
    literally grabbed off the street and forced into a terrifying situation
    of sexual slavery. Having failed to secure protection  abroad  she  was
    compelled to return to the country where that  appalling  event  befell
    her and live in hiding. Having little choice, she claims that  she  hid
    in the home  of  her  parents,  notwithstanding  that  her  father  had
    effectively disowned her because she had become pregnant as a result of
    her rape and had had an abortion. That evidence was  shocking,  but  in
    the context of Albania, there was nothing inherently  incredible  about
    it. We know that the trafficking of women for  the  purpose  of  sexual
    exploitation remains a serious problem in that country;  we  know  that
    certain elements of Albanian society continue to operate  under  strict
    patriarchal norms where the 'honour' of the family is closely connected
    to the chastity and behaviour of  its  women:  TD  and  AD  (Trafficked
    women) CG [2016] UKUT 00092 (IAC). We also know that "self-confinement"
    in the home is an established practice in Albania for those seeking  to
    avoid harm from outside actors: EH (blood feuds) Albania CG [2012] UKUT
    00348 (IAC).


13. It is against that background that Mr  Lee  rightly  submits  that  the
    central credibility findings of the First-tier Tribunal  in  this  case
    cannot stand. At �215 the decision states:

         "Whilst the appellant has given evidence that between 2012 and 2015
         when she returned to Albania she basically remained indoors I found
         this somewhat difficult to accept".


    No explanation is given as to why that might be  difficult  to  accept.
    Nor is it apparent from the face of  the  decision  that  the  Tribunal
    sought to place the Appellant's claims about her actions in the context
    of the country background evidence, or the country  guidance  decisions
    referred to above. In his submissions Mr McVeety suggested that it  was
    difficult to accept that the Appellant might  choose  to  hide  at  her
    parents' house because she had fallen out with them, and because it was
    the most obvious hiding place imaginable. As Mr Lee put it, those might
    have been good reasons had the Tribunal articulated them. As it  is,  I
    am unable to say why the Tribunal was unable to accept the evidence  on
    this matter.

14. At �216 the same phrase is used again:


         "Whilst accepting that the appellant  was  trafficked  as  set  out
         above it is somewhat difficult to accept  that  the  appellant  was
         still in fear of a further incident of this nature given  that  she
         had voluntarily returned to Albania with her husband following  the
         refusal of the asylum claim in Belgium (albeit I  have  noted  that
         the first appellant has advised that she did not wish to return  to
         Albania)".


    I am at a loss to understand why it might  be  "somewhat  difficult  to
    accept" that a woman who had been kidnapped  and  raped  would  have  a
    subjective fear of the same thing happening again.  No  explanation  is
    given as to why the Tribunal was here apparently rejecting the detailed
    evidence of the Appellant about how  she  had  no  wish  to  return  to
    Albania but was given no choice.


15. The phrase is used a third time at �218:


         "I find it difficult to accept that for three years  the  appellant
         was living with her parents that she  was  living  in  a  situation
         where she had the level of discord with her parents as  claimed  by
         her and was being subjected to threats from her husband's family"


    Again it is not explained why, in the context of Albanian society, that
    evidence was difficult to believe.  Lots of women in  Albania  live  in
    circumstances which by our standards might appear intolerable.


16. Mr McVeety was prepared to  concede  that  the  language  used  by  the
    Tribunal was unhelpfully ambiguous, but he submitted that  overall  the
    findings were clear.   I  accept  that  notwithstanding  the  imprecise
    language it is clear from the decision that the First-tier Tribunal was
    rejecting the evidence: what I  do  not  accept  is  that  intelligible
    reasons  were  given  for  that  conclusion.   I  therefore   set   the
    credibility findings made aside.


17. I should add for the sake of completeness that there appears  to  be  a
    Robinson obvious error at �222 in  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  has
    failed to appreciate what the matters  in  issue  between  the  parties
    actually were. The Tribunal there rejects the claim  that  there  is  a
    blood feud between the two families when, as it notes at its  own  �16,
    the Respondent had not placed this matter in issue. The Respondent  had
    accepted that AT has a subjective fear of harm  but  had  rejected  his
    claim for protection on the basis that  he  could  internally  relocate
    and/or seek the protection of the Albanian authorities.



    Ground 2: Trafficking


18. It is not in dispute that HT is a victim of trafficking. That  was  the
    finding of fact of the Competent Authority, applying the civil standard
    of a 'balance of probabilities'.  Before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  HT
    relied on that fact to submit that this was relevant to:


           a)  The  risk  assessment  under  the  Refugee  Convention,   in
              particular to whether she could  reasonably  be  expected  to
              internally relocate within Albania:  TD & AD (Albania)


           b)  Whether  there  were  very  significant  obstacles  to   her
              integration in Albania: paragraph 276ADE(1) Immigration Rules

           c) The proportionality of refusing her leave to  remain  in  the
              United Kingdom today: Article 8 ECHR.


19. Ground 2 consists of the simple complaint that none of those  arguments
    are addressed by the  First-tier  Tribunal.  I  agree.  The  unreasoned
    finding at �223 that the mental health treatment required by  HT  would
    be available to her in Albania does not engage with the arguments about
    the objective evidence on that matter, nor with the  detailed  evidence
    about HT's particular needs,  to which I return below.  The same can be
    said for the finding at �230 that the Appellants have shown  a  "degree
    of resilience".




    Ground 3: Expert Evidence


20. The Appellants relied on two important sources of evidence which do not
    feature in the reasoning of the First-tier Tribunal.


21. The first was a detailed expert report by Antonia Young dated the  11th
    October 2019.  No issue was taken with Ms Young's expertise. She  is  a
    Senior Honorary Research Fellow at the University of  Bradford,  as  an
    anthropologist who has spent many years specialising in  the  study  of
    Albanian, and wider Balkan, society. Ms Young's  report  addressed  the
    plausibility of this claim in the context  of  her  in-depth  knowledge
    about Albania, considered the obstacles that the Appellant's might face
    in relocating within  that  country  and  specifically  looked  at  the
    evidence about the integration of victims of trafficking post TD &  AD.
    The Tribunal acknowledges that the report was before it in its  summary
    of the submissions made, but nowhere is the information supplied by  Ms
    Young considered or used to contextualise the evidence when it came  to
    the findings. That is an error of law.

22. The second source of evidence was provided by the Snowdrop  Project,  a
    charity based in Sheffield which  provides  long-term,  community-based
    support to survivors of trafficking. HT was referred to the project  in
    2016 and has been receiving  support,  including  mental  health  care,
    there ever since.  The  authors  of  the  multiple  letters  from  this
    organisation all  therefore  know  her  well.   They  report  that  she
    regularly suffers from "crippling anxiety", "panic",  "depression"  and
    "flash backs" and that having to re-narrate her trafficking  experience
    re-traumatizes her. She  suffers  from  sleep  deprivation  because  of
    nightmares and hallucinations and as a result  is  often  found  to  be
    "fatigued, distant, withdrawn and unfocused".  It is the  view  of  the
    Snowdrop Project that the Appellant will only be able to  overcome  the
    mental health sequalae of her abduction and rape once she feels  stable
    and safe.  None of that evidence is addressed in the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal. That is an error of law.



      Conclusion


23. The crux of Mr McVeety's submissions were that this appeal  should  not
    be allowed because on any evaluation, the Appellants had failed to make
    out their claims for protection: any errors in approach were  therefore
    immaterial. In the final analysis he may well be right. The  Appellants
    are however entitled to a proper consideration of their linked  claims,
    made upon the application of the correct standard of  proof  and  legal
    principles, and with clear reasons given for  the  conclusion  reached.
    That is particularly so where the historical  events  underpinning  the
    claims are not in dispute.  With this in mind I reluctantly agree  that
    this is a case where the interests of justice require that  the  appeal
    must be heard de novo in the First-tier Tribunal.




    Anonymity Order

24. These appeals concerns claims for protection.   Having  had  regard  to
    Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008  and  the
    Presidential Guidance Note No 1 of 2013: Anonymity Orders  I  therefore
    consider it appropriate to make an order in the following terms:


         "Unless and until a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
        Appellants are granted anonymity.  No report of  these  proceedings
        shall directly or indirectly identify the Appellants or any  member
        of their family.  This direction applies to, amongst  others,  both
        the Appellants and the Respondent.  Failure  to  comply  with  this
        direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"




    Decisions


25. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside.


26. The appeal is to be heard afresh in the First-tier  Tribunal  before  a
    judge other than Judge Malcolm.

                             4th September 2020
