                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. The appellant is a citizen of the Philippines born on 28 January 1980.
    She entered the UK in September 2011 as the fiancï¿½e of her former
    husband. Following entry to the UK, the appellant married her former
    husband and was granted leave to remain as his spouse until 27 February
    2014. The relationship broke down and the appellant was not granted
    further leave. She appealed and her human rights claim was dismissed by
    the First-tier Tribunal on 27 May 2015. She became an overstayer on 15
    June 2015.

 2. In October 2016 the appellant commenced a relationship with Mr M, who
    is a British citizen, and they began living together in March 2017.

 3. On 10 July 2018 the appellant applied for leave to remain in the UK on
    the basis of her family life with Mr M. On 30 August 2018 the
    application was refused on the basis that the appellant had only been
    residing with Mr M for 15 months and therefore the definition of a
    partner in Appendix FM (which requires 2 years cohabitation) was not
    met and that, in any event, it would not be unjustifiably harsh for Mr
    M to relocate with her to the Philippines. The respondent acknowledged
    the concern raised by the appellant as to the risk to foreign nationals
    in the Philippines but stated that if there are areas of the
    Philippines that are dangerous the appellant and Mr M could relocate to
    another part of the country.

 4. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal where her appeal was
    heard by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Judge Griffith ("the judge").
    In a decision promulgated on 5 April 2019 the judge dismissed the
    appeal. The appellant is now appealing against that decision.

Decision of the First-tier Tribunal

 5. It was not in dispute, and the judge accepted, that the relationship
    between the appellant and Mr M was genuine and subsisting and that they
    had (as of the date of the hearing) been cohabiting for more than two
    years such that the definition of partner in Appendix FM was met.

 6. The judge directed herself that the relevant issue under the
    Immigration Rules was whether there would be insurmountable obstacles
    to the appellant's family life with Mr M continuing in the Philippines
    (paragraph EX.1(b) of Appendix FM).

 7. In considering "insurmountable obstacles" the judge had regard to Mr
    M's professional qualifications and capacity to obtain work in the
    Philippines (paragraph 58 of the decision); the security situation as
    described by the Foreign & Commonwealth Office (paragraph 59); an
    article concerning the death of the mayor in the region in which the
    appellant's brother and parents live (paragraph 60); and the ability of
    the appellant and Mr M to reside in a part of the Philippines which has
    not been identified as dangerous to Westerners (paragraph 60). Although
    the judge recognised that there may be challenges to living in the
    Philippines, she concluded that these did not amount to "insurmountable
    obstacles". She found that the appellant had not shown that there would
    be very significant difficulties in continuing her family life with Mr
    M in the Philippines that could not be overcome or would entail very
    serious hardship for them.

 8. The judge then considered Article 8 outside the Immigration Rules.  She
    found that the appellant was not a "particularly impressive or reliable
    witness" and found that although she had been aware that she had
    overstayed in June 2015 she had not disclosed this to her partner. The
    judge found that the appellant's relationship with Mr M began when she
    was in the UK unlawfully and therefore little weight should be attached
    to it. The judge stated that it was for Mr M to decide whether to
    relocate with the appellant to the Philippines or remain in the UK
    without her.  The judge concluded there were not compelling reasons to
    allow the appeal outside the Immigration Rules.

 9. The judge also considered whether it would be disproportionate to
    require the appellant to leave the UK for the sole purpose of making an
    entry clearance application from the Philippines. She stated at
    paragraph 65 that but for the appellant's immigration history, which
    meant that she would fall foul of paragraph 320(7B) of the Immigration
    Rules, it was likely she would meet the requirements for entry
    clearance.  The judge found at paragraph 66 that given the relationship
    had been relatively short lived, the couple have no children and the
    appellant has family in the Philippines, it would not be
    disproportionate for her to return to the Philippines in order to make
    an entry clearance application.

Grounds of Appeal and Submissions

10. Although there are four grounds of appeal, the grant of permission to
    appeal indicates that only the first two are arguable; and at the
    hearing before us Mr Karim only made submissions in respect of these
    grounds. We will therefore only consider the first two grounds of
    appeal.

11. The first ground of appeal argues that it was an error of law for the
    judge to find that an application for entry clearance from the
    Philippines might not succeed because of the operation of paragraph
    320(7B) of the Immigration Rules when paragraph A320 makes clear that
    paragraph 320(7B) is not applicable in an application for entry
    clearance as a family member under Appendix FM.

12. Mr Karim argued that this error was material because the judge found at
    paragraph 65 (and the evidence before the First-tier Tribunal
    demonstrates) that it was likely the appellant would meet the
    eligibility and financial requirements for entry clearance. Therefore,
    submitted Mr Karim, had this error not been made the judge would have
    found that, on the balance of probabilities, it was certain that the
    appellant would be granted entry clearance upon making an application
    from the Philippines.

13. The second ground of appeal maintains that the assessment of
    insurmountable obstacles was flawed because (a) reliance was placed on
    a Foreign and Commonwealth Office Report ("the FCO report") concerning
    the risk to British visitors to the Philippines when Mr M would be
    relocating permanently to, and not merely visiting, the Philippines;
    and (b) the judge failed to engage with the news articles submitted by
    the appellant showing the level of terrorism, violence and risk to
    foreigners throughout the Philippines. Mr Karim also advanced the
    argument that the judge failed to adequately consider of the risk
    factors identified in the FCO report, including in particular the
    reference to there being a state of emergency in the Philippines.

14. Mr Avery acknowledged that the judge fell into error by finding that
    paragraph 320(7B) would be relevant to an entry clearance application
    by the appellant but argued that the error was not material because it
    was not certain that she would succeed in an entry clearance
    application and the judge had made a sustainable (and unchallenged)
    finding that temporary relocation to the Philippines would not be
    disproportionate.

15. With respect to insurmountable obstacles, Mr Avery argued that the
    judge had adequately considered the evidence before her and that the
    evidence supported her conclusion that there are parts of the
    Philippines where it is not unsafe for a foreigner. He also argued that
    Mr M would have the benefit of local knowledge, as he would have the
    assistance of the appellant and her family.

Error of Law

16. Paragraph 320(7B) of the Immigration Rules provides that, inter alia,
    entry clearance is to be refused where an applicant has previously
    breached the U.K.'s immigration laws by overstaying. However, by
    operation of Paragraph A320, Paragraph 320(7B) is not applicable to an
    application for entry clearance as a partner, which is the application
    the appellant would make from the Philippines.

17. Although the parties agreed that the judge made an error of law by
    finding that Paragraph 320(7B) would affect an application for entry
    clearance by the appellant, they did not agree as to whether this error
    was material.

18. It is well established that there might be no public interest in
    removing a person from the UK, even if that person is residing in the
    UK unlawfully, if it is certain they would be granted leave to enter
    from outside the UK. This was the finding in Chikwamba v Secretary of
    State [2008] UKHL 40 and it has recently been confirmed by the Supreme
    Court in R (on the application of Agyarko) v Secretary of State [2017]
    UKSC 11, where it was stated at paragraph 51:

         "Whether the applicant is in the UK unlawfully, or is entitled to
         remain in the UK only temporarily, however, the significance of
         this consideration depends on what the outcome of immigration
         control might otherwise be.  For example, if an applicant would
         otherwise be automatically deported as a foreign criminal, then the
         weight of the public interest in his or her removal will generally
         be very considerable.  If, on the other hand, an applicant even if
         residing in the UK unlawfully was otherwise certain to be granted
         leave to enter, at least if an application was made from outside
         the UK, then there might be no public interest in his or her
         removal.  The point is illustrated by the decision in Chikwamba v
         Secretary of State for the Home Department."  (Emphasis added)

19. In order to succeed in an application for entry clearance from the
    Philippines, the appellant would need to satisfy the eligibility and
    financial requirements under section EC-P of Appendix FM, which require
    her to meet both suitability and eligibility requirements. The judge
    found, at paragraph 65, that it is likely the appellant would meet the
    eligibility and financial requirements for entry clearance. Having
    reviewed the documents that were before the First-tier Tribunal (and
    noting that in the respondent's refusal letter of 30 August 2018 it is
    acknowledged that the appellant did not fall for refusal under the
    similar suitability requirements that apply in an application for leave
    to remain), we are satisfied that the judge was correct to find that it
    is likely the eligibility and financial requirements would be met.
    This, therefore, as submitted by Mr Karim, is a case in which (on the
    balance of probabilities) it is certain the appellant would be granted
    entry clearance from the Philippines. Had the judge appreciated that
    her findings regarding the eligibility and financial requirements meant
    that an application for entry clearance would succeed, her assessment
    of the proportionality of temporary separation in order to make an
    application may have reached a different outcome. We therefore agree
    with Mr Karim that the error in respect of Paragraph 320(7B) was
    material.

20. We now turn to consider whether the judge erred in her assessment of
    whether there would be "insurmountable obstacles" to the relationship
    continuing in the Philippines.

21. The judge correctly recognised that the only viable route open to the
    appellant under the Immigration Rules would be to establish that
    EX.1(b) applied because there are insurmountable obstacles to the
    relationship with Mr M continuing in the Philippines. The judge also
    correctly recognised that EX.2 provides that:

         "For the purposes of paragraph EX.1.(b) "insurmountable obstacles"
         means the very significant difficulties which would be faced by the
         applicant or their partner in continuing their family life together
         outside the UK and which could not be overcome or would entail very
         serious hardship for the applicant or their partner."

22. The appellant's argument that there would be insurmountable obstacles,
    as defined by paragraph EX.2, relies on being able to establish that
    the objective evidence shows that it would be unsafe for Mr M to reside
    with the appellant in the Philippines. It is clear from the decision
    that the judge appreciated this issue lay at the heart of the
    appellant's case. It is also clear, from a review of paragraphs 58 - 60
    of the decision, that the judge considered the evidence before her
    concerning the risk to Westerners in Philippines.

23. Mr Karim submitted that the judge erred by relying on the FCO report
    because it related only to visitors. We disagree. Although the FCO
    report is aimed at visitors, much of its content is equally relevant to
    the safety of British citizens residing permanently in the Philippines.
    Although Mr Karim is now saying that the judge should not have relied
    on the FCO report, it is apparent from Mr Karim's skeleton argument
    before the First-tier Tribunal (see paragraph 13 of the skeleton
    argument, which refers to the FCO report) that he sought to have it
    relied upon.

24. The appellant adduced various articles about the current security
    situation in the Philippines. However, it is clear that the FCO report
    was by far the most authoritative and comprehensive evidence that was
    before the First-tier Tribunal about the level of risk to Westerners in
    the Philippines (which is no doubt why Mr Karim referred to it in his
    skeleton argument) and the judge cannot be faulted for placing
    significant reliance upon it.

25. Mr Karim is correct that several significant observations in the FCO
    report were not mentioned in the decision (such as the reference to
    there being a state of emergency in the Philippines) but a judge is not
    required to mention every relevant point in a report and there is
    nothing in the decision that would indicate the report has not been
    adequately considered. Mr Karim submitted that the judge's reference to
    British nationals not normally being targeted at paragraph 59 of the
    decision is not consistent with the statement in the FCO report that
    foreigners are targeted. However, the judge's statement about British
    nationals is an accurate recording of the content of the FCO.

26. In any event, it was consistent with both the FCO report and the news
    articles that were before the First-tier Tribunal for the judge to find
    that there are parts of the Philippines that are not considered unsafe
    for foreigners. It clearly will likely cause difficulty and hardship to
    Mr M to relocate to the Philippines, given the implications for his
    work and family life in the UK and that he would be relocating to a
    country where there is a state of emergency and problems with violence,
    kidnapping and terrorism. However, given that the objective evidence
    that was before the First-tier Tribunal supports the view that there
    are parts of the Philippines that are relatively safe, the judge was
    entitled to conclude that relocation to one of those areas would not
    entail the degree of hardship necessary to support a finding of
    insurmountable obstacles under EX.1.(b) as defined in EX.2.

Remade Decision

27. The remaking of the decision is limited to the question of whether
    article 8 ECHR would be infringed by removing the appellant from the UK
    given that (as found at paragraph 19 above) she would, on the balance
    of probabilities, be certain to be granted entry clearance upon making
    an application under Appendix FM from the Philippines.

28. Where a person is certain to be granted leave to enter, the issue to be
    addressed is whether there is a public interest in her temporary
    removal in order to make an entry clearance application from outside
    the UK. The Supreme Court made clear in Agyarko (following Chikwamba)
    that there might not be a public interest in a person's removal even if
    they have been residing in the UK unlawfully if it is certain they
    would be granted leave to enter. See paragraph 51 of Agarko (cited
    above at paragraph 18).

29. In considering whether there is a public interest in the appellant's
    temporary removal, our starting point is that there is a public
    interest in the maintenance of immigration control. The importance of
    this is made clear by Section 117B(1) of the Nationality Immigration
    and Asylum Act 2002. As a general matter, the maintenance of
    immigration control is undermined by allowing a person in the UK
    unlawfully to circumvent Immigration Rules that would require her to
    leave the UK in order to make an application. However, this general
    statement must be considered in light of Chikwamba and Agyarko, where
    it is clearly envisaged (see paragraph 51 of Agyarko cited above) that
    there may be no public interest in removing a person seeking leave to
    remain in the UK as a family member under Appendix FM if that person is
    certain to be granted entry clearance under Appendix FM "even if [the
    person] is residing in the UK unlawfully".

30. It has not been argued (and there is no evidence to suggest) that there
    is a relevant public interest arising from a factor other than the
    appellant's immigration history of being an overstayer since June 2015.
    The question to be addressed, therefore, is whether, because of the
    appellant's immigration history, the public interest is served by her
    being required to temporarily relocate to the Philippines in order to
    make an entry clearance application that is certain to be allowed.

31. Having carefully considered the appellant's immigration history, we are
    satisfied that there is no such public interest. When the appellant
    entered the UK in 2011 she did so as the fiancï¿½e of her former husband.
    This is not, therefore, a case of someone entering the UK unlawfully or
    through an immigration route (such as a visitor or student) where she
    could have no legitimate expectation of permanent settlement and then
    seeking to switch to the partner route once in the UK. On the contrary,
    the appellant came to the UK (legitimately) as a family member under
    Appendix FM. Given that we have found that it is certain she would be
    granted leave to enter the UK from the Philippines as Mr M's partner,
    we can see no public interest in her temporary removal even though she
    became an overstayer in 2015. This appears to be precisely the type of
    case the Supreme Court had in mind at paragraph 51 of Agyarko. The
    appeal is therefore allowed under article 8 ECHR.



DECISION

32. The decision of the First Tier Tribunal is set aside on the basis  that
    it contains a material error of law. We remake the decision  and  allow
    the appeal.
