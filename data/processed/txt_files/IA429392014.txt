                         NOTIFICATION OF WITHDRAWAL

Permission was granted to  appeal  against  a  determination  by  First-tier
Tribunal Judge Bradshaw, promulgated on 14 May 2015.  By  letter  dated  and
faxed on 9 October 2015, the appellant applied to withdraw his appeal.   The
respondent did not oppose that application.   There  is  no  reason  not  to
permit withdrawal.  In terms of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)
Rules 2008, Rule 17, the appeal is recorded as having  been  withdrawn  with
the consent of the Upper Tribunal.   The  determination  of  the  First-tier
Tribunal therefore stands.
