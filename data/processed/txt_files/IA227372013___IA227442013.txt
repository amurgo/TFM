For the Appellant:     Mr C Mannan of Temple Court Chambers
For the Respondent:    Mr C Avery, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1. Both parties are appellants in this appeal. The Secretary  of  State  for
   the Home Department (SSHD) appeals against the decision of the First-tier
   Tribunal allowing  Ms  Khatun's  and  Mr  Newton's  appeals  against  the
   decision to remove them from the United  Kingdom  by  way  of  directions
   under section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum  and  Nationality  Act  2006.
   Additionally, Ms Khatun and Mr Newton appeal against the decision of  the
   First-tier Tribunal dismissing their  appeals  against  the  respondent's
   decision to refuse their respective applications for leave to remain as a
   Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant and a Tier 1 Partner.

2. For the purposes of  this  decision,  I  shall  hereafter  refer  to  the
   Secretary of State as the respondent and Ms Khatun and Mr Newton  as  the
   appellants, reflecting their positions as they were in the appeal  before
   the First-tier Tribunal.

3. The appellants, wife and husband, are citizens of Bangladesh born  on  10
   December 1990 and 1  November  1986  respectively.  The  first  appellant
   entered the United Kingdom on 22 January 2011 with entry clearance  as  a
   Tier 4  General  student  valid  until  30  September  2012.  The  second
   appellant, her husband, first entered the United Kingdom  on  19  October
   2011 with entry clearance as a Tier 4  General  dependent  partner  valid
   until 30 September 2012. On 6 August 2012 the first appellant applied for
   further leave as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant and the second appellant
   applied for leave to remain as the partner of a Tier 1 Migrant.

4. The first appellant's application was refused by  the  respondent  on  17
   May 2013 on the grounds that she had submitted false documents, namely  a
   letter and bank statement from Agrani Bank Limited dated  15  July  2012,
   relating to an account held in the name of Ms Selim Ahmed, proprietor  of
   M/S Selim  &  Brother.  The  respondent  refused  the  application  under
   paragraphs 322(1A) of HC 395 and was satisfied that the  first  appellant
   had used deception in her application. As a result she was also unable to
   acquire the required points under Appendix  A  and  her  application  was
   accordingly also refused under paragraph 245DD  of  HC  395.  The  second
   appellant's application was refused as a consequence of that decision.

5. The appellants appealed against those decisions in general terms and,  at
   their request, their appeals were considered on the papers by the  First-
   tier Tribunal. In a determination promulgated on 18 September 2013, First-
   tier Tribunal Judge Phull dismissed the  appeals  under  the  immigration
   rules, upholding the allegation as to deception. However she allowed  the
   appeals against the removal decisions as being not in accordance with the
   law.

6. Permission to appeal was sought by the Secretary of State on the  grounds
   that the section 47 removal decisions were lawful, having been made after
   8 May 2013 following the amendments made by section 51 of the  Crime  and
   Court Act 2013. Permission was granted on 18 December 2013.

7. Permission to appeal was also sought by the appellants,  on  the  grounds
   that there were deficiencies in the  document  verification  report  such
   that it ought not to have been relied upon by the judge. The grounds also
   mentioned that the appellant was pregnant at the time of the  application
   for permission and had been  unable  to  do  many  things  as  a  result.
   Permission to appeal was granted on 21 March 2014 on the grounds that the
   appellant's pregnancy arguably explained her failure to engage  with  the
   appeal and that the second appellant's presence had been neglected.

8. In a rule 24 response, the respondent opposed the appellants' appeals.

Appeal hearing and submissions

9. The appeal came before me on 14 July 2014. Mr Mannan submitted  that  the
   document verification report was unreliable as it was  not  supported  by
   evidence and did not give details of the identity of the  parties  making
   and  receiving  the  enquiries.  The  judge  should  have  adjourned  the
   proceedings to enable the appellant to produce further evidence, given in
   particular that the account-holder and the account details  were  correct
   and that the report relied upon only two entries in the bank statement in
   concluding that the document was false. Furthermore the appellant was not
   involved in any deception herself and the bank  documents  related  to  a
   third party. The judge ought also to have considered the  impact  of  the
   decision on the second appellant. Mr Mannan had no  submissions  to  make
   with respect to the Secretary of State's grounds of appeal.

10. Mr Avery submitted that  there  was  nothing  wrong  with  the  document
   verification report which had not  been  challenged  in  the  grounds  of
   appeal before the judge. With regard to the Secretary of State's  appeal,
   the removal decision was lawful.

11. I advised the parties that in my view there were no  errors  of  law  in
   the judge's determination with respect to the  variation  decisions,  but
   that her decision to allow  the  appeals  with  respect  to  the  removal
   decisions was clearly wrong in law. My reasons for so concluding  are  as
   follows.

Consideration and findings.

12.  In support of  her  application  for  leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  1
   (Entrepreneur) Migrant the first appellant produced a letter from  Agrani
   Bank Limited purporting to confirm that funds of ï¿½200,000 were  available
   to her and her business partner from a third party, Md Selim  Ahmed,  the
   proprietor of M/S Selim & Brother. A bank statement was also produced for
   the bank account of Md Selim Ahmed. The respondent relied upon a document
   verification  report  (DVR)  in  concluding  that  the  bank  letter  and
   statement were false. The report referred to a conversation  between  the
   caseworker and the bank representative in which the latter confirmed that
   the bank records showed that the account existed in the relevant name but
   that the balance amounts in the statement were not  consistent  with  the
   actual account balances on two chosen dates.

13. Mr Mannan submitted that the judge was wrong to rely on the  DVR  as  it
   was deficient, since it did not give the name of the bank  representative
   and relied  upon  two  entries  only  whilst  the  account  details  were
   otherwise correct. However I do not consider that the DVR is in  any  way
   deficient, given that all relevant reference numbers were given in it and
   that the relevant financial documentation  was  clearly  annexed  to  the
   enquiry. It seems to me that the judge was  perfectly  entitled  to  rely
   upon the document.

14. That is not, in any event, the point in issue so much as the  fact  that
   there was no challenge to the DVR before the judge. The grounds of appeal
   made no mention of it and were extremely general in terms. The appellants
   did not elect to have an oral hearing at  which  they  could  attend  and
   provide  explanations  and  neither  did  they  produce  any  documentary
   evidence to address the DVR. There was no explanation before the judge as
   to why a papers  determination  was  preferred  and  no  application  for
   further time to produce additional documentation. The judge was perfectly
   entitled, in such circumstances, to  rely  upon  the  DVR  as  adequately
   discharging the respondent's burden  of  proving  falsity.  She  properly
   identified that the burden lay upon the respondent and that it was a high
   one. She applied the relevant principles in AA (Nigeria) v  Secretary  of
   State for the Home Department [2010] EWCA Civ 773 and properly recognised
   that, contrary to Mr Mannan's  assertion,  the  fact  that  the  document
   related to a third party was irrelevant for the purposes of the mandatory
   refusal under the rules. The judge was, accordingly, entitled to conclude
   that the respondent had made out the allegation of deception and that the
   first appellant, and as a result the second appellant, could not meet the
   requirements of the immigration rules.

15. With regard to the Secretary  of  State's  appeal,  Mr  Mannan  did  not
   challenge the grounds and clearly it is the case that the judge erred  in
   concluding that the section 47 removal decision  was  unlawful.  In  that
   respect, the judge's  decision  has  to  be  set  aside  and  re-made  by
   dismissing the appeal against the removal decision.

16. It is relevant to add that I raised the fact  that  Article  8  had  not
   been considered by the judge  and  invited  Mr  Mannan  to  make  further
   submissions but he had nothing to add. On the evidence before  the  judge
   it is clear that the appellants could not succeed on an Article  8  claim
   and I would also dismiss the appeals on Article 8 grounds.

DECISION

17. With respect to the appeals under the immigration rules, the  making  of
   the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of  an
   error on a  point  of  law  and  the  decision  to  dismiss  the  appeals
   accordingly stands.

18. With respect to the removal decision, the making of the decision of  the
   First-tier Tribunal did involve the making of an error on a point of  law
   and has to be aside. The  decision  is  re-made  by  the  dismissing  the
   appeals against the removal decision.
