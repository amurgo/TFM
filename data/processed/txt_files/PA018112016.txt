               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

For the Appellant:     Mr D McGlashan, of McGlashan MacKay, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr A Mullen, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. A panel of the FtT comprising Designated Judge J  Macdonald  and  Judge
    Grace dismissed the appellant's appeal by determination promulgated  on
    25 January 2017.

 2. He appeals to the UT on grounds which may be summarised thus:

      The FtT in concluding at �17 that the evidence of the appellant is not
      plausible erroneously compared his  evidence  at  screening  interview
      ("SI")  with  what  he  said  at  his  subsequent  substantive  asylum
      interview ("AIR") and his subsequent statement (�18, 23-31).   The  SI
      is a chance to state briefly why an appellant cannot return.  What  he
      says is not to be taken as an  authoritative  summary  of  why  he  is
      claiming asylum.  In concluding that inconsistency between SI and  AIR
      was material, the FtT erred in  law.   Had  the  appellant  failed  to
      mention at AIR the basis (political opinion) of his claim  that  would
      arguably have been material, but failure to mention this  at  SI  (and
      instead mentioning a  problem  with  his  uncle)  is  not  a  material
      discrepancy.

      The above error distracted the FtT from making findings  on  the  core
      claim advanced at �3 - 10 of the statement adopted  as  his  evidence:
      how he became attracted to the KDPI in Iran,  how  and  by  whom  this
      support was enlisted, what form this took and  its  consequences.  The
      FtT does not accept or reject this evidence.  Alternatively, if it was
      rejected, that must have been because the SI was not  consistent  with
      the AIR, a reason not open to it as set out above.

      The FtT erred because its misgivings about the appellant's evidence of
      how he arrived in the UK (�19-21, 33) have  no  bearing  on  the  core
      issue.  Evidence about the method by which the appellant  reached  the
      UK may not have persuaded the FtT, but that has no bearing on  whether
      his fear of persecution is well founded.

Submissions for appellant.

 3. The panel over-emphasised the SI, contrary to YL [2004] UKIAT 145, �19:

      ... a screening interview is not  done  to  establish  in  detail  the
      reasons to support [the] claim for asylum ...  Further  the  screening
      interview may well be conducted when the asylum seeker is tired  after
      a  long  journey.   These  things  have  to  be  considered  when  any
      inconsistencies ... are later evaluated.

 4. The panel took no account of  the  proper  distinction  among  evidence
    drawn from a SI, an AIR,  and  a  witness  statement.   The  weaknesses
    identified did not go to the core claim.  No account was taken  of  the
    appellant's witness statement at �15, 16 and  17  in  response  to  the
    refusal decision. The same principles applied  to  show  error  in  the
    panel's approach to issues over the appellant's travel.  He had made it
    clear his dating was approximate, tried to hide  nothing  and  made  no
    embellishments.  Any discrepancies were insignificant.   This  was  not
    the type of case where an inaccurate account of travel showed that  the
    appellant was not in his country at the time of claimed events.

Submissions for respondent.

 5. Comparison between SI and a later account is legitimate, as  stated  in
    YL, also at �19:

      Asylum seekers are still expected to tell the truth and answers  given
      in screening interviews can be  compared  fairly  with  answers  given
      later.

 6. The appellant was asked at  screening  interview  about  matters  which
    ought to have led him to disclose the core of the case  and  which  did
    disclose significant discrepancy - see the decision  at  paragraphs  21
    and 25. The appellant's inconsistency over dates and timings did go  to
    events in Iran - see paragraph 30. The panel was justified  in  finding
    that the appellant was not an accurate witness over  his  journey  from
    Iran to the UK. That was not the fundamental reason for finding against
    him, but they were entitled to take it as detrimental to  the  rest  of
    his account. The panel gave full reasoning set out at paragraphs 16  to
    34, with which the grounds amounted only to a partial disagreement.

Response for appellant.

 7. The appellant's later evidence regarding his ill-treatment by his uncle
    when he was a young boy was  not  an  embellishment  of  his  case  but
    explanation of how it had been misunderstood  by  the  respondent.  The
    panel failed to appreciate that, and should not have taken this chapter
    of the evidence as disclosing any material discrepancy.  A  discrepancy
    identified at paragraph 25 over how long he had known  the  person  who
    introduced him to the KDPI was immaterial, given that his position  had
    always been that they came from the same village.

Discussion and conclusions.

 8. The appellant goes too far in arguing that discrepancies arising from a
    SI or over travel to the UK cannot be held as materially  adverse,  and
    in submitting that there were no other reasons.

 9. Some of the  self-contradictions  and  weaknesses  in  the  appellant's
    evidence were plainly significant, and there is not said to  have  been
    any error in identifying them: e.g. paragraph 23,  oral  evidence  that
    the appellant's uncle did not know about his KDPI activities  while  he
    was in  Iran; SI evidence, his uncle found out he was helping the  KDPI
    and threatened him; paragraph 26, oral evidence that  everyone  in  the
    village knew his uncle was in the Ettela'at; not credible a KDPI member
    would risk asking for help from his  relative  (and  household  member)
    rather than from someone unconnected to the security services.

10. Tribunals in general know the need to approach inconsistencies based on
    screening interviews and on peripheral matters with some  caution,  and
    know that core accounts may be upheld notwithstanding discrepancies  of
    that nature.   This  was  a  panel  of  two  judges  with  considerable
    experience of assessing  such  issues.   Whether  inconsistencies  were
    material, in other words the degree of weight to be given to them, was,
    within reason and the established parameters, a matter for the panel.

11. The grounds and submissions do not show  that  the  tribunal  gave  any
    matters a degree of weight which went beyond reason, or fell  into  any
    error of legal  approach.   The  grounds  resolve  into  no  more  than
    selective disagreement on the facts.

12. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.

13. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
