                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction and Background

 1. The Secretary of State appealed against a decision of Judge Bowler (the
    judge) of the First-tier Tribunal (the  FTT)  promulgated  on  24  July
    2018.

 2. The respondent before the Upper Tribunal was the appellant  before  the
    FTT and I will refer to him  as  the  claimant.  He  is  a  citizen  of
    Zimbabwe born 2 September 1984.

 3. The claimant  appealed  against  the  respondent's  decision  dated  18
    September 2017 to refuse his application for leave to remain in the  UK
    on human rights grounds.

 4. The appeal was heard on 11 July 2018.  The  claimant  had  applied  for
    further leave to remain as a spouse of a refugee but by the date of the
    FTT hearing it was accepted that his marriage had ended.  The  claimant
    had started a new relationship with a British national but this had not
    been considered by the Secretary of State  and  was  therefore  a  'new
    matter' as defined by section 85 (6) of  the  Nationality,  Immigration
    and Asylum Act 2002 and could not be considered by the FTT without  the
    consent of the Secretary of State  which  was  not  given.  The  appeal
    therefore proceeded on the basis of the claimant's  private  life.  The
    judge observed that the claimant needed to make a separate  application
    to the Secretary of State if he wished his relationship  with  his  new
    partner to be considered.

 5. The judge noted that the claimant originates from Harare and considered
    EM and Others (Zimbabwe) CG [2011] UKUT 98 (IAC) observing that  Harare
    is a high-density area and the judge therefore decided that there would
    be a significant risk that the claimant would be homeless  if  returned
    to Zimbabwe. On that basis the judge found the claimant would face very
    significant  obstacles  to   integration   and   concluded   that   the
    requirements of paragraph 276 ADE (1) (vi) ware satisfied.

 6. In considering article 8 of the  1950  European  Convention  the  judge
    found the  claimant  had  three  adult  siblings  in  the  UK  but  his
    relationship with those siblings did not engage article 8 on  a  family
    life basis. The judge  found  that  the  claimant  had  established  'a
    particularly rich private life in the UK' and had  resided  in  the  UK
    since 30 August 2008. The judge acknowledged that section 117B  of  the
    2002 Act established that little weight must be given to  private  life
    established  by  an  individual  when  in  the  UK  with  a  precarious
    immigration status but recorded that 'little weight does  not  mean  no
    weight. I cannot ignore the very significant contribution he  has  made
    over 10 years,  particularly  as  a  support  worker  for  adults  with
    learning disabilities.'

 7. The judge acknowledged  the  public  interest  in  the  maintenance  of
    effective immigration controls but concluded this was satisfied because
    the claimant satisfied the requirements of the immigration  rules.  The
    appeal was allowed with reference to article 8 of the 1950 Convention.

 8. The Secretary of State applied for permission to appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal. It was contended that the judge had erred in law  by  failing
    to give  adequate  reasoning.  The  judge  had  acknowledged  that  the
    claimant had failed to provide background evidence as to what obstacles
    he would face on return. It was  contended  that  the  judge  erred  in
    finding the appellant would  be  homeless,  by  failing  to  take  into
    account that the claimant had family support in the UK and in Zimbabwe,
    and the appellant is the director of a business in the UK. No  evidence
    had  been  provided  to  indicate  that  the  claimant  would  not   be
    financially supported by his family or from the business. The judge had
    noted that the appellant had developed a skill  set  in  the  UK  which
    would assist if returned to Zimbabwe and it was unclear how  the  judge
    had reached a conclusion that the appellant would be homeless and would
    face very significant obstacles to integration.  Permission  to  appeal
    was granted.

Error of Law

 9.  On 15 October 2018 I heard submissions from both parties  in  relation
    to error of law and concluded that the judge's  decision  must  be  set
    aside. Full details of the application for  permission,  the  grant  of
    permission, the submissions made by the parties, and my conclusions are
    contained  in  my  error  of  law  decision  dated  16  October   2018,
    promulgated on 23 October 2018. A  brief  summary  of  my  reasons  for
    setting aside the decision is set out below.

10. I found the judge erred in relying upon EM (Zimbabwe) at  paragraph  36
    which relates to a person  who  has  demonstrated  that  they  are  not
    reasonably likely to have any family or other support and who would  be
    returning to a high-density area of Harare. The  judge  had  failed  to
    take into account that the appellant does have some family in Zimbabwe,
    at least a cousin, and friends, and his partner has  family  who  could
    provide some support in reintegration.

11. There was no consideration of whether the claimant's family in  the  UK
    could offer financial support. He is the director  and  shareholder  of
    the business. The judge did not give adequate reasons  as  to  why  the
    high threshold in paragraph 276 ADE  (1)  (vi)  was  met,  particularly
    bearing in mind the guidance given  in  Treebhawon  [2017)  UKUT  00013
    (IAC) to the effect that mere hardship, mere difficulty, mere  hurdles,
    mere  upheaval  and  mere  inconvenience,  even  where  multiplied  are
    unlikely to satisfy the test of very significant obstacles in paragraph
    276 ADE.

12. Having found that the judge erred in failing to give  adequate  reasons
    for conclusions on paragraph 276 ADE (1) (vi) I found this affected the
    proportionality exercise carried  out  with  reference  to  article  8,
    particularly because in carrying out that  exercise  the  judge  placed
    weight upon the fact that the claimant could  satisfy  the  immigration
    rules, which is relevant when considering the public interest.

Re-making the Decision

13. At the resumed hearing the claimant attended. He confirmed that he  had
    no  difficulty  in  speaking  and  understanding  English.  He  further
    confirmed that he did not have legal representation and that he  wished
    to  proceed  without  representation.   I   was   satisfied,   in   the
    circumstances, that this was appropriate. I explained to  the  claimant
    the purpose of the hearing and he acknowledged that he had received  my
    error of law decision.  He  had  no  further  documentary  evidence  to
    submit.

14. I confirmed that I had the bundles of documents that had been submitted
    by both parties before  the  FTT.  Mr  Jarvis  provided  a  copy  of  a
    determination that  related  to  the  claimant  with  reference  number
    OA/51563/2007 promulgated on 11  April  2008.  This  was  the  decision
    allowing the claimant's appeal against refusal of entry clearance.

15. The claimant indicated that he would be giving  oral  evidence  and  he
    would not be calling any witnesses.

16. The claimant then gave his oral evidence which I have recorded in  full
    in my record of proceedings and will not reiterate here. In very  brief
    summary the claimant explained that he has family and  friends  in  the
    UK. He has  lived  here  continuously  since  2008.  He  has  built  up
    relationships. It  would  be  very  hard  for  him  to  reintegrate  in
    Zimbabwe. The situation in Zimbabwe has  deteriorated.  The  claimant's
    life is now in the UK.

17. The claimant was cross examined  and  all  questions  and  answers  are
    recorded in my record  of  proceedings  and  it  is  not  necessary  to
    reiterate them. If relevant I will refer to the oral  evidence  when  I
    set out my conclusions and reasons. It is appropriate  to  record  that
    the claimant when answering questions put by Mr Jarvis  disclosed  that
    prior to coming to the UK he had not in fact been living in Harare  but
    had been living in Masvingo which he described as being a  distance  of
    200 km away from Harare. The claimant had lived in  Masvingo  since  he
    was 13 years of age. He would sometimes visit an aunt in Harare  during
    holidays. That aunt now lives in the outskirts of Harare.

18. When I was satisfied that the claimant had given all the evidence  that
    he thought relevant I heard oral submissions on behalf of the Secretary
    of State.

19. Mr Jarvis relied upon the decision to refuse leave to remain  dated  18
    September 2017. I was asked to note that the claimant had  accepted  in
    evidence that he had work experience in Zimbabwe before coming  to  the
    UK, working in a warehouse, and as a  car  mechanic.  In  the  previous
    determination,  allowing  the  claimant's  appeal,  the  claimant   was
    described as living in comfortable circumstances. At that time  he  was
    sponsored by an aunt resident in the UK who was also providing him with
    financial support.

20. The claimant had given evidence that he had invested �10,000 in setting
    up his business with his brother.  The  reference  by  the  FTT  to  EM
    (Zimbabwe) was an error because if returned to  Zimbabwe  the  claimant
    could return to his home area which was Masvingo. I was asked  to  note
    that the claimant had not been involved in politics and did  not  claim
    to be at risk.

21. I was asked to find that the claimant had not discharged the burden  of
    proof in relation to paragraph 276 ADE (1)  (vi),  and  there  were  no
    exceptional circumstances which would justify allowing the appeal  with
    reference to article 8 of the 1950 Convention.

22. I then heard representations from the claimant. He explained  that  his
    aunt who had provided him with some financial support when  he  was  in
    Zimbabwe could no longer do so because her circumstances  had  changed.
    He asked that I take into account the good work that he had done  while
    in the UK in that he had worked as a carer. I was asked  to  take  into
    account the length of time the claimant had  been  in  the  UK  and  to
    accept that his life was now in the UK and not in Zimbabwe.

23. I reserved my decision.

My Conclusions and Reasons

24. Only one ground of appeal is open to the claimant  and  I  must  decide
    whether the Secretary of State's decision is contrary to section  6  of
    the Human Rights Act 1998. The claimant relies upon article  8  of  the
    1950 Convention in relation to his private life in the UK. In  deciding
    this appeal I adopt the balance sheet approach recommended at paragraph
    83 of Hesham Ali [2016] UKSC 60.

25. The burden of proof lies on the  claimant  to  establish  his  personal
    circumstances in the UK and to establish that article 8 is engaged.  It
    is for the Secretary of State to establish the public interest  factors
    weighing against the claimant. The standard of proof is  a  balance  of
    probabilities throughout.

26. I find that article 8 is engaged on the basis of the claimant's private
    life. I set out the factual matrix below.

27. The claimant has lived in the UK  continuously  since  arriving  on  30
    August 2008. His purpose in coming to the UK was initially to study  as
    a dental nurse. The claimant is now 34 years of age. He has three adult
    siblings residing in the UK. He is not dependent on those siblings  and
    he has not established family life with them that would engage  article
    8. Following the breakdown of his marriage the claimant  is  in  a  new
    relationship although he said in his oral evidence  that  he  does  not
    live with his new  partner,  and  in  any  event  I  cannot  take  that
    relationship into  account  for  the  reasons  given  earlier  in  this
    decision.

28. The claimant has worked as a carer in the UK. He has set up a  business
    with his brother into which �10,000 was invested.  I  accept  his  oral
    evidence that he receives an income of approximately �15,000  per  year
    from the business.

29. Prior to coming to the UK the claimant lived and worked in Masvingo for
    approximately 11 years. He stated in his witness statement that he  had
    experience working as  a  car  mechanic,  and  evidence  given  at  his
    previous appeal hearing indicated that he worked  in  a  warehouse  and
    shop and as a driver. A judicial  finding  was  made  in  the  previous
    determination that the appellant lived in comfortable circumstances  in
    Zimbabwe. I accept the appellant's evidence  that  he  has  never  been
    involved in politics in Zimbabwe and he does not claim to be at risk in
    Zimbabwe.

30. Having set out the factual matrix I now consider whether the  appellant
    can  satisfy  the  immigration  rules  which  is  a  relevant  but  not
    determinative consideration. It is not suggested that the claimant  can
    satisfy the requirements of appendix FM in relation to family life  and
    I find that to be the case.

31. The claimant relies upon paragraph 276 ADE (1) (vi) which means that he
    must  prove  on  a  balance  of  probabilities  that  there  are   very
    significant obstacles to his integration in  Zimbabwe.  In  considering
    this I follow the guidance in  Treebhawon  which  has  been  summarised
    earlier in this decision.

32. In relation to integration I follow the guidance in Kamara [2016]  EWCA
    Civ 813. At paragraph 14 it is explained that there  must  be  a  broad
    evaluative judgement. It must be considered whether  an  individual  is
    enough of an insider in terms of understanding how life in the  society
    in the country of return is carried on. The individual  must  have  the
    capacity to participate in life in that country and have  a  reasonable
    opportunity to be accepted there and operate on a day-to-day basis. The
    individual must be able to build up within a reasonable time a  variety
    of human relationships to give substance to  their  private  or  family
    life.

33. The claimant is a citizen of Zimbabwe. He has lived the greater part of
    his life in that country. He would not have any linguistic difficulties
    if he returned. There are no relevant health issues. The claimant is in
    good health and does not claim that there are  any  medical  conditions
    which could not be treated in Zimbabwe.

34. Prior to moving to the  UK  the  claimant  was  living  in  comfortable
    circumstances and had employment. He has not been involved in  politics
    and is not at risk. He maintains contact  with  a  distant  cousin  who
    resides in Masvingo.

35. The claimant now has increased employment skills having  been  resident
    in the UK since 2008. I find no satisfactory reason has been  given  as
    to why the  claimant  could  not  obtain  employment  in  Zimbabwe.  No
    satisfactory evidence has been provided to indicate that  the  claimant
    could not withdraw funds from the business he has set  up,  or  receive
    some financial support from family in the UK.

36. The evidence does not indicate that the claimant would be  homeless  or
    destitute if he returned to Zimbabwe. The claimant  would  be  eligible
    for support from the Home Office Voluntary Returns Service. I  conclude
    that the claimant has not proved that there would be  very  significant
    obstacles to his integration in Zimbabwe.

37. Because the claimant cannot satisfy the immigration rules does not mean
    that his appeal must fail.  I  must  consider  whether  there  are  any
    exceptional circumstances which would  result  in  unjustifiably  harsh
    consequences if he had to return to Zimbabwe.

38. When considering proportionality and the public interest  I  must  have
    regard to the considerations listed in section 117B of  the  2002  Act.
    The maintenance of effective immigration  controls  is  in  the  public
    interest. I find it is appropriate to place weight upon the  fact  that
    the appellant cannot satisfy  the  immigration  rules  in  relation  to
    family and private life.

39. It is in the public interest that a person seeking leave to remain  can
    speak English  and  is  financially  independent.  I  accept  that  the
    appellant can speak English and is financially  independent  and  these
    are neutral factors in the balancing exercise.

40. Section 117B provides that  little  weight  should  be  placed  upon  a
    private life established when an individual has been in the UK  with  a
    precarious immigration status. The claimant has always had a precarious
    immigration status because he  has  only  ever  had  limited  leave  to
    remain. I find that I am bound to attach little weight to  the  private
    life that he has established for that reason.

41. Having carefully considered the evidence, I do not find that there  are
    any exceptional circumstances which would result in unjustifiably harsh
    consequences if the claimant had to return to Zimbabwe. If the claimant
    wishes to make an application in relation to his new relationship, such
    an application will have to be made to the Secretary of State.

42. In my view the weight that must be attached to the public  interest  in
    maintaining effective immigration control outweighs the  weight  to  be
    attached to the appellant's wishes to remain in the UK. The decision of
    the Secretary of State is proportionate and does not breach  article  8
    of the 1950 Convention.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the FTT involved the making of an error of law  and  is  set
aside. I substitute a fresh decision.

The appeal of the Secretary of State is allowed.

I dismiss the appeal of the claimant.

No anonymity direction is made.
