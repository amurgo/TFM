                      ERROR OF LAW DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Shafiat Sobhan, date of birth 7.4.77, is  a  citizen  of
    Bangladesh.

 2. This is his appeal against the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Scott-Baker promulgated 14.8.14,  dismissing  his  appeal  against  the
    decision of the Secretary  of  State,  dated  16.7.13,  to  refuse  his
    application made on 26.7.12  for  permanent  residence  as  the  family
    member of an EEA  national,  Evelina  Iordanova  Ivanova,  a  Bulgarian
    national, pursuant to the  Immigration  (EEA)  Regulations  2006.   The
    Judge heard the appeal on 13.5.14.

 3. First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Astle  refused  permission  to  appeal  on
    24.9.14. However,  when  the  application  was  renewed  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal, Upper Tribunal Judge  Chalkley  granted  permission,  stating
    only that he believed that the grounds raised properly arguable  issues
    which merit further consideration.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 13.7.15 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Scott-Baker should be set aside.

 6. The issue in the appeal relates to the  requirement  for  comprehensive
    sickness insurance cover (CSIC).  On 18.9.04 the sponsoring spouse  was
    issued with indefinite leave to remain (ILR) under  the  long-residence
    provisions of the Immigration Rules. She was naturalised as  a  British
    citizen on 15.12.06.

 7. The refusal decision explained that for the appellant  to  be  able  to
    benefit from regulation 15(1)(b) not only does he have to have  resided
    in the UK with the EEA national for  5  years,  but  she  has  to  have
    exercised Treaty rights in the UK for a continuous period of  5  years.
    That  she  obtained  ILR  and  later  British  citizenship   does   not
    automatically qualify the sponsor for  the  appellant's  EEA  permanent
    residence application.  There  was  no  sufficient  evidence  that  the
    sponsor had exercised Treaty rights in the UK for 5 years and thus  the
    appellant's application was refused.

 8. Judge Scott-Baker noted at ï¿½36 of  her  decision  that  it  was  common
    ground that once the sponsor acquired an effective permanent  right  of
    residence she was no  longer  required  to  demonstrate  that  she  was
    exercising Treaty rights. However, she failed to establish that she had
    acquired a permanent right of residence by failing to demonstrate  that
    she was a self-sufficient person and that she held the requisite CSIC.

 9. The appellant contended that both he and the sponsor acquired  a  right
    of permanent residence in the UK on Bulgaria's accession to the  EU  on
    1.1.07, or in the alternative no later than 1.1.12. The judge concluded
    that the five-year period  could  only  run  from  when  the  appellant
    married the sponsor in 2001 and thus there had to be a five-year period
    elapsing thereafter, during which time there had to be CISC. The  judge
    found there was evidence of health insurance for  the  sponsor  between
    1.1.00 and 31.12.04, a five-year period,  but  the  sponsor  failed  to
    establish that she had been self-sufficient within the meaning  of  the
    EEA Regulations, or that she held any CISC after 31.12.04, and that  at
    no time did the appellant have CISC. For the appellant to rely  on  the
    sponsor's EEA rights she  needs  to  demonstrate  compliance  with  the
    Regulations, including CISC. The appeal was thus dismissed.

10. In refusing permission to appeal, Judge Astle noted that whether or not
    the sponsor was self-sufficient at the  date  of  introduction  of  the
    concept of permanent residence on 28.4.06, she did not  have  CSIC  and
    thus  she  did  not  qualify  for  permanent  residence.  Further,  the
    appellant also had to have CSIC, which he did not.

11. In his submissions Mr Tufan made a  more  fundamental  point  than  the
    dispute as to periods of self-sufficiency or CISC.  The  appellant  was
    not entitled to the EEA residence card issued in 2007, as at that  time
    the sponsor was a British citizen. As held in EN  &  AN  (EEA  reg  12:
    British citizens) Kenya [2008] UKAIT 00028,  "A  British  citizen,  not
    being subject to any  of  the  restrictions  on  residence  in  the  UK
    implicit and explicit in the EEA regulations,  cannot  be  regarded  as
    "residing in the UK in accordance  with  these  Regulations,"  for  the
    purpose of reg 12, even if he has citizenship of another  Member  State
    as well." Mr Tufan submitted that by analogy this principle must  apply
    to regulation 15, which uses the almost identical phrase, "EEA national
    who has  resided  in  the  United  Kingdom  in  accordance  with  these
    Regulations." Deputy President Ockelton pointed out in EN that there is
    nothing in the definition of "EEA  national"  that  prevents  a  person
    being  an  EEA  national  if  he  has  dual  nationality,  one  of  the
    nationalities being nationality  of  the  UK.  However,  as  a  British
    citizen has no restrictions on the purposes for which he may be in  the
    UK or the length of time for which he may be here, he  cannot  properly
    be described as a person residing in the UK under the Regulations.

12. It follows that in 2007 the appellant was not the family member  of  an
    EEA national residing in the UK in accordance with the Regulations.  He
    was the spouse of British citizen who first obtained ILR on  the  basis
    of long-residence and then British citizenship outside  the  provisions
    of the Regulations. It also follows that the appellant cannot now claim
    permanent residence on the basis of the sponsor's  purported  residence
    in the UK in accordance with the Regulations.

13. The appellant points to the Immigration (EEA)  (Amendment)  Regulations
    2012, Schedule 1(d) of which changed the definition of EEA national  to
    mean one who is not also  a  UK  national.  However,  the  transitional
    provisions of Schedule 3, paragraph 2, provides that where the right of
    a family member (F) to be admitted to or reside in the UK  pursuant  to
    the 2006 Regulations depends on the fact that a person (P)  is  an  EEA
    national, P will continue to be regarded as an  EEA  national  for  the
    purpose of the Regulations where the criteria set  out  thereunder  are
    met, for as long as they remain satisfied in accordance with  paragraph
    2(5) of Schedule 3. Those criteria include where F  was  on  16.7.12  a
    person with a right to reside in the UK under the 2006 Regulations  and
    held a valid EEA Residence Card. Whilst the appellant has held  an  EEA
    Residence Card from 2007 and valid until 26.7.12, Mr Tufan's point  was
    that he was not in fact entitled to that Residence  Card  and  that  it
    should not have been issued. Therefore the transitional  provisions  do
    not assist the appellant.

14. In any event, in the alternative, even if the  Regulations  apply,  the
    appellant did not himself have CSIC and therefore cannot claim to be  a
    person who is himself not an EEA national but who has resided in the UK
    with the EEA national  in  accordance  with  these  regulations  for  a
    continuous period of 5 years.  Regulation  4(2)(b)  provides  that  the
    requirement of  a  self-sufficient  person  as  defined  in  regulation
    4(1)(c) to have CSIC is not satisfied unless he and his family  members
    also have such cover. The appellant never had any CSIC at any time  and
    thus the sponsor never met the CSIC requirement and therefore she never
    was a self-sufficient person within the meaning of the Regulations.  As
    the Court of Appeal held in Kamau (Kenya) [2010]  EWCA  Civ  1302,  the
    requirement of CSIC is not a mere formality, "it is an integral part of
    the concept of self-sufficiency under the Regulations. The  Regulations
    give effect to  the  United  Kingdom's  obligations  under  EU  law  to
    facilitate the free movement, not merely of workers and those  who  are
    self-employed, but also those who are self-sufficient together in  each
    case with their family members." It was held in that case that reliance
    on the UK's NHS  is  "no  more  self-sufficient  than  a  person  whose
    resources are inadequate so that he may become a burden on  the  United
    Kingdom's social assistance system." The Court of Appeal endorsed  this
    view in Ahmad v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ  988,  where  Lady  Justice  Arden
    found nothing to make the requirement  for  CSIC  disproportionate  and
    found that the argument that entitlement to free NHS care could satisfy
    the requirement for CSIC is fundamentally inconsistent with the purpose
    of the requirement of the Directive.

15. It follows that the appeal could not have succeeded, whether or not the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge was correct in concluding  that  the  sponsor
    failed  to  demonstrate  that   she   was   self-sufficient.   In   the
    circumstances, there is no material error of law in the decision of the
    First-tier Tribunal.

Conclusion & Decision:

16. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should
    be set aside.

                    I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.

Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.



Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed and thus there can be no fee award.
