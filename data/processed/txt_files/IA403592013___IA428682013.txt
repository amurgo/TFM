                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Background to this Application

 1. By a letter dated 12th September 2013 the respondent refused  leave  to
    remain in  the  United  Kingdom  on  grounds  of  the  medical  problem
    surrounding  the  appellant's  child.   The  appellant  appealed   that
    decision and it came before FTTJ Thorne who dismissed the appeal  in  a
    decision  promulgated  on  22nd  July  2014.   The   appellant   sought
    permission to appeal and the grounds of that application are below.

         "1.  The Appellants seek permission to appeal against the decisions
             of  First  tier  Tribunal  (FtT)  promulgated   on   22/07/14,
             dismissing their appeals  against  the  Secretary  of  State's
             decision refusing to grant them leave to  remain  outside  the
             Immigration Rules.

         2.   It is contended that the Tribunal materially  erred  in  that:
             the assessment of Article 8 and best interest and  welfare  of
             the dependent child  with  reference  to  Section  55  of  the
             Immigration, Citizenship and Borders Act 2009 was flawed;  the
             Tribunal failed to consider material matters; failed  to  make
             clear  findings;  and  in  not  giving  weight   to   material
             evidence/matters, thus rendering  the  decision  unsafe.   The
             Tribunal did so, on the following grounds:

         3.   Although in considering the argument for allowing  the  appeal
             under Article 8  outside  the  Immigration  Rules,  the  Judge
             refers to the case of Gulshan (Article 8 new Rules  -  correct
             approach)  [2013]  UKUT   640   at   paragraph   42   of   the
             determination, he nevertheless fails to apply the test set out
             therein, consistently when considering the case for the  first
             Appellant (referred to in the determination as "A1")  and  the
             dependent child  (paragraphs  44  and  50  respectively).   He
             refers  to  "compelling  circumstances"  and  "arguably   good
             grounds" interchangeably  and  looks  for  whether  there  are
             "compelling circumstances" that are  capable  of  constituting
             "arguably good grounds" for considering the case  outside  the
             Immigration Rules and appears to conduct a balancing  exercise
             as to the competing interests as part of  that  consideration.
             The Judge's approach is flawed and amounts to a material error
             of law.

         4.   Further and or alternatively, the Tribunal inadvertently erred
             in its approach to Article 8 ECHR in light  of  the  Court  of
             Appeal's judgment in MM v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
             Department  [2014]  EWCA  Civ  985  (which  was  handed   down
             following the hearing of the appeal but before promulgation of
             its determination) which sets out  the  correct  approach  and
             held essentially that (paragraph  128)  if  the  rules  are  a
             complete code then there will  be  a  proportionality  balance
             within the rules and if the rules are not a complete code then
             there  should  be  a  proper  proportionality  exercise  under
             Article 8 ECHR, thus removing the  need  for  an  intermediary
             test.  In this appeal it was contended that the Rules are  not
             a complete code as Appendix FM and/or 276ADE did not allow for
             consideration of the first Appellant  and  or  her  daughter's
             medical  health,  their  ongoing  treatment  (for  example  at
             paragraphs 11-12 & 18 of the  skeleton  argument).   Reference
             was also made to an  ongoing  General  Medical  Council  (GMC)
             investigation for which the Appellants had given their consent
             (skeleton argument  paragraphs  14  &  26)  and  documentation
             concerning the same was served.  Arguably the judgment  in  MM
             reinforces the  contention  that  there  are  factors  in  the
             present for which there are no provisions in the  Rules.   The
             Judge failed to properly apply the facts of the  case  to  the
             either guidance.  This amounts a material error of law.

         5.   The Judge  in  refusing  to  consider  the  case  outside  the
             Immigration  Rules  purports  to  go   behind   the   apparent
             concession made by the Respondent in the Reasons  for  Refusal
             letter in which the case is considered outside the Rules  (see
             reference  to  "Decision  on  Exceptional  Circumstances"  and
             reference to Articles 3 & 8).  Had the Tribunal had regard  to
             this, he would have arguably adopted a different  approach  in
             considering Article 8 ECHR.

         6.   The Judge failed to consider  material  matters  such  as  the
             policy as referred to in the skeleton argument  (paragraph  16
             and policy served) and the Respondent's failure to  apply  its
             own policy  to  grant  discretionary  leave  where  there  are
             ongoing proceedings/investigations in the  context  of  a  GMC
             investigation.  The Judge fails to make any  specific  finding
             in respect of this.  This is an arguable error.

         7.   In finding at paragraph  46  of  the  determination  that  the
             Appellants had "failed to establish that  they  would  not  be
             able to access equivalent health care in India for their child
             as is available in the UK" and again  in  the  same  terms  at
             paragraph 50 of the determination, the Judge again appears  to
             go behind what the Respondent's accepts  in  the  RFRL  namely
             that  there  is  a  difference  in  the  standard  of  medical
             facilities in India compared to those  available  in  the  UK.
             Thus failing to take into account material matters.   Had  the
             Judge had regard to this, it would have been incumbent on  him
             to consider this as part of a proportionality assessment  when
             looking at Article 8 as referred the case  of  Akhalu  (health
             claims: ECHR Article 8) [2013] UKUT 400, (also  cited  in  the
             determination at paragraph 43) as part of their  private  life
             in the UK.

         8.   The Judge fails to make credibility findings in respect of the
             first Appellant's (A1) oral  evidence  and  give  reasons  for
             rejecting the same.  The Judge falls into error  as  he  looks
             for corroboration thus deeming  the  Appellant's  evidence  as
             insufficient to satisfy the standard of proof  in  respect  of
             key issues such as the availability of treatment in India  and
             GMC investigation (paragraphs 48 & 49  of  the  determination)
             the  Judge  appears  to   require   corroboration.    Such   a
             requirement is unlawful.  It is contended that the Judge  made
             a material mistake and applied the wrong standard of proof  to
             the assessment of the Appellant's oral evidence.  The arguably
             adopted a similar approach in his treatment of the documentary
             evidence that was available to and submitted by the Appellants
             concerning the paucity of specialist treatment  in  India  and
             its  accessibility  (referred  to  at  paragraph  48  in   the
             determination), rejecting the evidence because of what it  did
             not show.  The  Respondent  was  provided  with  the  relevant
             material and it was considered in the RFRL and no evidence  in
             rebuttal was relied upon.  In the circumstances  the  Tribunal
             should have attached greater weight to the evidence.

         9.   Further and or alternatively, the Judge failed to have  regard
             to the witness statement of the second  Appellant  (A2)  which
             was adopted at the hearing and was  not  challenged  in  cross
             examination.  The  Judge  consequently  also  failed  to  have
             regard to material evidence as  going  to  the  issues  to  be
             decided.

         10.  The Judge erred  in  failing  to  have  regard  to  the  first
             Appellant's oral evidence and or the letter dated  6  December
             2013 from Mark Lee Investigating Officer Fitness  to  Practice
             Directorate served prior to and at the hearing,  concerning  a
             GMC enquiry into possible negligence.  In doing so  the  Judge
             failed to consider as part of any assessment material evidence
             going to the issue  of  the  Appellants  and  their  dependent
             child's private life in the UK (not covered by the Immigration
             Rules).  Further the Judge errs at  paragraph  49  in  finding
             "There is no evidence that any doctor in the  UK  working  for
             the NHS has acted negligently or  that  any  such  enquiry  is
             actively being pursued ..."The first Appellant's evidence  and
             the letter confirming that a doctor is being  investigated  in
             respect of his/her practice in  connection  with  the  child's
             delivery on 26 May 2013 was  before  him.   Consequently,  the
             Judge's in finding to the contrary, renders  the  decision  is
             unsafe.  Had the Tribunal considered the evidence properly  it
             may have come to a different  conclusion,  particularly  given
             the  strong  public  interest  factor   in   the   Appellant's
             supporting the investigation.

         11.  The Tribunal did not properly direct itself to Section 55  and
             the relevant case law cited in  the  skeleton  argument.   The
             only reference to the child's best interest is at paragraph 50
             and then only in a narrow context where the Judge  finds  that
             the best interests would met by the child remaining  with  her
             parents (paragraph 50).   The  Tribunal  materially  erred  in
             failing to conduct an objective  assessment  as  required,  to
             ascertain what the child's interests may be  and  her  welfare
             require (as opposed to the family being removed together)  (MK
             (India) [2011]  UKUT  00475)  as  a  distinct  best  interests
             assessment.   The  Judge  failed  to  consider   the   child's
             interests/needs in the context of  ongoing  medical  treatment
             and investigations/reviews as detailed in the medical evidence
             provided (paragraphs 15-19).  He failed to consider the impact
             of any disruption in that treatment  and  the  feasibility  of
             accessing services/treatment in India owing  to  the  family's
             particular circumstances.  The Judge failed to have regard  to
             the  GMC  investigation  as  part  of   the   best   interests
             assessment.  Arguably, the Tribunal  failed  to  consider  and
             make findings on material matters/evidence going to  the  best
             interests and welfare of the child, capable of  affecting  the
             decision.  In the circumstances the decision is flawed.

         12.  Further and or alternatively, it is incumbent on the  Tribunal
             show that  factors  in  favour  of  the  Appellant  have  been
             properly considered (paragraph 1 of ML (Nigeria) v SSHD [2013]
             EWCA Civ 844).  The Tribunal have  failed  to  do  so  in  the
             Appellants and their dependent child's case.

         13.  In the circumstances, owing  to  the  series  of  errors,  the
             Tribunal is invited to find that the decision  is  unsafe  and
             the decision should be set aside and the matter remitted  back
             to the First Tier Tribunal."

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge Ievins granted permission to appeal  on  12th
    September 2014 in the following terms:

         "REASONS FOR DECISION (including any decision on extending time)

         1.   Permission to appeal is sought by a female national  of  India
             and her husband against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal
             Judge  Thorne  sitting  at  Stoke-on-Trent  to  dismiss  their
             appeals against the refusal of their applications for leave to
             remain in the United Kingdom outside  the  Immigration  Rules.
             Mrs Gauri, the first appellant, was in the United Kingdom on a
             student visa with her husband as her dependant.  The visa  was
             to expire on 27 July 2013 but on 26 May 2013 she gave birth to
             their  daughter  Hareet  Kaur  Toor.   Sadly  their   daughter
             suffered  some  birth  injuries.    Although   there   is   an
             Immigration Appeal  Tribunal  file  for  her  under  reference
             IA/42860/2013 there is no valid appeal in relation to her  and
             the daughter's immigration status stands or falls on  that  of
             her parents.

         2.   After the daughter's birth an  application  was  made  by  the
             parents for  discretionary  leave  to  remain  in  the  United
             Kingdom on human rights grounds.  That application was refused
             and an appeal was heard, and dismissed, by First-tier Tribunal
             Judge Thorne sitting  at  Stoke-on-Trent.   He  dismissed  the
             appeals because the  two  appellants  did  not  qualify  under
             paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration Rules.  They had not  been
             in this country long enough.  He found Article 3 of the  Human
             Rights Convention was not breached and in relation to  Article
             8 adopted what he described as  the  "Gulshan  approach".   He
             concluded  that  there  were  no  arguably  good  grounds  for
             granting leave to  remain  outside  the  Rules  so  a  further
             Article 8 assessment was not necessary once he had found  that
             the  appellants  did  not  satisfy  Article   8   within   the
             Immigration Rules.

         3.    In  dismissing  the  appeal  under  Article  8  outside   the
             Immigration  Rules  the  appellants  submit  that  the   judge
             employed the wrong test.  This is a reference to the  case  of
             Gulshan (Article 8 - new rules - correct approach) [2013] UKUT
             640.  He did not take into account  the  case  of  MM  v  SSHD
             [2014] EWCA Civ  985  which  was  handed  down  following  the
             hearing  of  the  appeal  but  before  the  determination  was
             promulgated.  In that case the Court of Appeal  held  that  if
             the Rules (as in this case) were not a complete code then if a
             case did not fall within the Immigration Rules there needed to
             be an Article 8 assessment outside the Immigration Rules.   It
             is asserted that there are factors in  the  present  case  for
             which the Immigration Rules do not provide.

         4.   Paragraph 7 of the grounds seeking  permission  to  appeal  is
             also arguable as is the  matter  mentioned  in  paragraph  10.
             There  there  is  reference  to  a  doctor  involved  in   the
             daughter's delivery  being  investigated  in  connection  with
             negligence during the child's  delivery.   This  is  a  factor
             relevant to the assessment of proportionality and  in  failing
             to take it into account it is arguable  that  the  judge  fell
             into material error of law.  All grounds are arguable.  I  can
             see no reason why an anonymity direction might be  appropriate
             and no such direction is made."

 3. Thus the matter came before me.

 4. On behalf of the appellant Mr Sharma relied  on  the  grounds  and  the
    skeleton argument placed before the  FTTJ  which  reiterated  the  same
    points.  In summary the issue for the  Tribunal  was  consideration  of
    Article 8 outside of the Immigration Rules and how  far  the  FTTJ  was
    required to go with that consideration; and secondly the failure of the
    FTTJ to consider the compassionate  circumstances  in  respect  of  the
    child.

 5. On behalf of the respondent Mr Shilliday submitted  that  the  tensions
    between the case law cited in the grounds have been resolved  following
    the decision of Underhill LJ in Singh v SSHD [2015] EWCA  Civ  74.   In
    summary Underhill LJ has found that Aitkins LJ  was  not  changing  the
    test set by Sales LJ in Nagre and all that Underhill LJ  is  saying  is
    that if an appellant's circumstances are dealt with in the  Immigration
    Rules and they do not meet the Immigration Rules then all that needs to
    be done in the Immigration Rules is an integral part of  an  Article  8
    assessment in conjunction with the residual discretion.   Mr  Shilliday
    accepted that in this case if there were an intermediary test the  FTTJ
    would have been entirely right to go outside of the Rules  but  in  his
    submission the findings and conclusions are perfectly adequate  and  so
    while there may have been a misdirection as to the law at paragraph  42
    it is not material because what follows at paragraphs 43  to  51  is  a
    full and complete assessment of all  the  relevant  factors.   That  is
    effectively the finding of paragraph 50 where the FTTJ found  that  the
    appellant's circumstances do not  constitute  compelling  circumstances
    not sufficiently recognised under the Immigration Rules.  Although  the
    phrase "Gulshan approach" might be problematic and the final wording of
    paragraph 50 is also problematic but in fact the FTTJ has followed  the
    correct approach and in paragraph 51 found removal is proportionate and
    that is ultimately the  test.   The  decision  made  by  the  FTTJ  was
    properly open to the judge.  GS (India) does not assist  the  appellant
    with regard to an Article 3 claim and does assist in  Article  8  which
    leaves the judge with MM (Zimbabwe).   There  are  problematic  phrases
    used in this decision but when  one  gets  down  to  the  findings  and
    conclusions the decision is sustainable.

 6. In reply Mr Sharma said there is a clear problem with the test  applied
    by the FTTJ at paragraph 42 and paragraphs 50 and 51 do  not  save  the
    decision.  It cannot be known had he approached  his  findings  in  the
    correct manner what he would have  said.   The  finding  about  medical
    treatment is not the final issue in Article 8  reliance  is  placed  on
    Akhalu (health claims: ECHR Article 8) [2013] UKUT  400  (cited  before
    the FTTJ).  Counsel who appeared before the FTTJ accepted she could not
    argue Article 3 but that  made  it  important  to  consider  Article  8
    outside of the Rules.  The argument about  compassionate  circumstances
    is not an irrationality challenge.  It is the appellant's case that the
    FTTJ's approach to the compassionate  circumstances  of  this  case  is
    fundamentally flawed because of the Article 8  assessment  and  how  he
    should have considered it.

The FTTJ's Findings

 7. The FFTJ' findings are:-

         "31. After having heard and read all the evidence in this case,  it
             is clear that the appellants fail to qualify under Appendix FM
             of the Immigration Rules.  In addition I am not  satisfied  on
             the balance of probabilities that the appellants qualify under
             paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration Rules.  They have not been
             resident in the UK for 20 years and their entire families  are
             living in India.  They have therefore failed to establish that
             they have lost their ties to that country.  Indeed  Ms.  Masih
             accepted that the appellants could not  succeed  under  either
             provision.  Her argument was that removal  of  the  appellants
             and their daughter would be a  breach  of  Article  3  of  the
             European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and Article 8  ECHR
             "outside the Immigration Rules".

         32.  Article 3 ECHR

         33.  In submissions Ms. Masih stated "I can't really argue  Article
             3 ECHR" but none the less said that she felt obliged to.

         34.  MM (Zimbabwe) v The Secretary of State for the Home Department
             [2012] EWCA Civ 279 in which this area of law was reviewed  by
             Moses LJ is binding on me.  He  said  "The  decisions  of  the
             House of Lords and of  the  European  Court  of  Human  Rights
             establish that even where a claimant is suffering from  mortal
             illness such as advanced  HIV/Aids  and,  if  deported,  would
             deteriorate rapidly and suffer an early death,  no  breach  of
             Article 3 is established.  The essential principle is that the
             ECHR does not impose any obligation on the contracting  states
             to provide those liable to deportation with medical  treatment
             lacking in their "home countries".  The principle applies even
             where the consequence will be that the deportee's life will be
             significantly  shortened  (see  Lord  Nicholls  in  N  v  Home
             Secretary [2005] 2 AC 296, 304 [15] and N v UK [2008] 47  EHRR
             885 (paragraph 44).

         35.  The independent documentary medical evidence  in  relation  to
             the child in this case establishes  that  she  was  born  with
             complications which resulted in the following being  diagnosed
             at birth:

                  (i)  Neonatal seizures

                  (ii) Encephalitis

                  (iii)    Abnormal imagine of skull and head

                  (iv) severe ischemic injury to her brain

                  (v)  Hypothermia therapeutic

                  (vi) Stridor

         36.  The child was discharged from  hospital  on  17/06/13  (having
             been born in the hospital  on  26/05/13)  without  any  active
             problems being noted.  She was not prescribed  any  medication
             but it was recommended that she see  a  physiotherapist.   She
             was described as being "well" at time of discharge.

         37.  The child requires ongoing physiotherapy and regular check-ups
             with doctors and neonatologists.  She was found to be "not fit
             for air travel" in August 2013 but there was  no  evidence  of
             her ability to travel now.  She would need help when she grows
             up It was also likely that she would  develop  "hemparesis  in
             the right side."

         38.  The independent documentary medical evidence in relation to A1
             is that she suffers from Urinary Stress Incontinence and needs
             to wear incontinence pads.

         39.  In light of this medical evidence and the fact that article  3
             ECHR is not engaged even where "a claimant is  suffering  from
             mortal illness such as advanced  HIV/Aids  and,  if  deported,
             would  deteriorate  rapidly  and  suffer  an  early  death"  I
             conclude that it has not been established that  returning  the
             appellants to India would breach the article 3 ECHR rights  of
             A1 or her daughter.







         40.  Article 8 ECHR (Further Considerations)

         41.  As was set out by Sales J in R (Nagre) v  Secretary  of  State
             for  the  Home  Department  [2013]  EWHC   720   (Admin)   the
             aforementioned Immigration Rules were amended to address  more
             explicitly  the  factors  which,  according  to  domestic  and
             Strasbourg case-law, weigh in favour of or against a claim  by
             a foreign national based on ECHR Article 8 to  remain  in  the
             United Kingdom.  They  were  thus  introduced  to  align  more
             closely the Immigration Rules and the approach  under  Article
             8, and to unify consideration under the Rules of Article 8 and
             section 55 of the Borders,  Citizenship  and  Immigration  Act
             2009 with deals with the welfare of children.   The  Secretary
             of State also issued instructions regarding the approach to be
             applied by officials in deciding  to  grant  leave  to  remain
             outside the Rules.   Those  instructions  were  that,  if  the
             requirements of the rule are not met, refusal will normally be
             appropriate but that leave can be  granted  where  exceptional
             circumstances,  in   the   sense   of   "unjustifiably   harsh
             consequences" for  the  individual,  would  result.   Sales  J
             stated  (at  [36])  that  this  residual   discretion   "fully
             accommodate[ed] the requirements of Article 8".

         42.  The case of Gulshan (Article 8 - new Rules - correct approach)
             [2013] UKUT 640 (IAC) states "after applying the  requirements
             of the Rules, only if there may be arguably good  grounds  for
             granting leave to remain outside  them  is  it  necessary  for
             Article 8 purposes to go on  to  consider  whether  there  are
             compelling circumstances  not  sufficiently  recognised  under
             them.

         43.  I have also taken into account  the  case  of  Akhalu  (health
             claim:  ECHR  Article  8)  [2013]  UKUT  400  (IAC)  which  is
             authority for the proposition that MM (Zimbabwe)  v  Secretary
             of State for the Home Department [2012] EWCA Civ 279 does  not
             establish that a claimant is disqualified from  accessing  the
             protection of article 8  where  an  aspect  of  her  claim  is
             difficulty or inability to access health care in  her  country
             of nationality unless, possibly, her private  or  family  life
             has a bearing upon her prognosis.  The correct approach is not
             to leave out of account what  is,  by  any  view,  a  material
             consideration  of  central  importance   to   the   individual
             concerned but to  recognise  that  the  countervailing  public
             interest in removal will outweigh  the  consequences  for  the
             health of the claimant because of a disparity of  health  care
             facilities in all but a very few rare cases.  The consequences
             of removal for the health of a claimant who would not be  able
             to  access  equivalent  health  care  in  their   country   of
             nationality as was  available  in  this  country  are  plainly
             relevant  to  the  question  of  proportionality.   But,  when
             weighed against the  public  interest  in  ensuring  that  the
             limited resources of this country's health service are used to
             the best effect for the benefit of those  for  whom  they  are
             intended, those consequences  do  not  weigh  heavily  in  the
             claimant's favour but speak cogently in support of the  public
             interests in removal.

         44.  The independent documentary medical evidence in relation to A1
             is that she suffers from Urinary Stress Incontinence and needs
             to wear incontinence  pads.   I  am  not  satisfied  that  her
             medical condition  constitutes  compelling  circumstances  not
             sufficiently recognised under the Immigration Rules.

         45.  The evidence before me also indicates that the child was  born
             with  complications  which  resulted  in  Neonatal   seizures,
             Encephalitis, abnormal  imaging  of  skull  and  head,  severe
             ischemic injury  to  her  brain.   Hypothermia  therapeutic  &
             Stridor.  The evidence indicates that the child was discharged
             from hospital within days of being  born  without  any  active
             problems being noted.  She was not prescribed  any  medication
             but it was recommended that she see  a  physiotherapist.   She
             was described as being  "well"  at  time  of  discharge.   The
             evidence  also  indicates  that  the  child  requires  ongoing
             physiotherapy  and  regular   check-ups   with   doctors   and
             neonatologists.  She was found to be "not fit for air  travel"
             in August 2013 but there was no evidence  of  her  ability  to
             travel now.  The medical opinion was that she would need  help
             when she grows up and  it  was  also  likely  that  she  would
             develop "hemparesis in the right side."

         46.  The child appears to require  no  medication.   Her  treatment
             needs appear to be ongoing physiotherapy and  regular  medical
             check-ups.  I conclude (for  reasons  given  below)  that  the
             appellants have failed to establish  that  such  treatment  is
             unavailable in India.   In  particular  they  have  failed  to
             establish that they would not be  able  to  access  equivalent
             health care in India for their child as is  available  in  the
             UK.

         47.  The  evidence  submitted  by  the  appellants  concerning  the
             provision of such treatment in India is sparse.  At page  143A
             of the appellant's bundle was a printout from a  web  site  of
             the Institute for Child Development which was described as the
             "only Paediatric Habilitation Centre (sic) in  Delhi,  India."
             The appellants are not  from  Delhi.   At  page  143C  of  the
             appellant's bundle was a printout from a web site of  the  All
             India Institute of Speech and Hearing in Mysore which outlined
             the services provided.  At page 144 was an  article  from  the
             Economic Times dated 26/06/14 which emphasised  how  excellent
             many aspects of healthcare in India had become but there  were
             still problems in poor areas.  From pages 147-157 were  copied
             various newspaper articles about the shortage of free medicine
             in a hospital in Rajindra, shortages or doctors  in  Ludhiana,
             cancer patients being  sent  to  defunct  hospitals  and  rape
             victims being charged  for  treatment.   It  is  difficult  to
             ascertain how any of this material is relevant to the question
             of the availability of treatment required by  the  appellant's
             child in India.

         48.  A1 said that the nearest hospital is a long way away but I saw
             no reliable independent evidence to indicate  that  she  could
             not access the required treatment nearer to her home in India.
              In addition she said that she had the support  of  family  in
             India and there is no reason to conclude that both  appellants
             (who were born on 16/08/91 & 11/05/83 and are  reasonably  fit
             and well educated) cannot find  employment  and  pay  for  any
             required medical treatment.

         49.  In addition A1 said that she has given her consent to the  GMC
             to investigate the circumstances of the birth of her daughter.
              There is no evidence that any doctor in the  UK  working  for
             the NHS has acted negligently or  that  any  such  enquiry  is
             actively being pursued or that if it was being pursued that it
             would be prejudiced by the appellants being returned to India.

         50.  I conclude that the best interests of the chid are  to  remain
             with its parents who would be returned to India  as  a  family
             unit.  It may well be that the appellants would prefer to stay
             in the UK and access what they consider to be the better  (and
             free) medical treatment available here for  their  child,  but
             that choice does not engage the  UK's  obligations  under  the
             ECHR and does  not  constitute  compelling  circumstances  not
             sufficiently recognised  under  the  Immigration  Rules.   For
             reasons given above it is clear that the appellants  have  not
             established that  that  they  would  not  be  able  to  access
             equivalent  health  care  in  India  for  their  child  as  is
             available in  the  UK.   Adopting  the  "Gulshan  approach"  I
             conclude therefore that in this case  there  are  no  arguably
             good grounds for granting leave to remain  outside  the  Rules
             and that therefore I should not consider  the  matter  further
             under Article 8 ECHR."

My Findings

 8. There can be no doubt from a reading of the  FTTJ's  decision  that  he
    considered Article 8 outside of the Immigration Rules.  Whilst  he  may
    have misstated the Gulshan test in �42 what matters is what he actually
    did with the evidence before him.  It can be seen at �45 that the judge
    was well aware of the difficulties of the appellant's child having been
    born  with  complications  which   resulted   in   neonatal   seizures,
    encephalitis, abnormal imaging  of  skull  and  head,  severe  ischemic
    injury  to  her  brain,  hypothermia,  therapeutic  and  stridor.   The
    evidence before the judge was that the child had been  discharged  from
    hospital within days of being born without any  active  problems  being
    noted.  She was not prescribed any medication but  it  was  recommended
    that she see a physiotherapist.  She was well at the time of discharge.
     The evidence before the FTTJ  indicated  the  child  required  ongoing
    physiotherapy and regular check-ups with  doctors  and  neonatologists.
    She was not fit for air travel in August 2013 but there was no evidence
    of her ability to travel at the date of the hearing before the FTTJ.

 9. There was some evidence before the FTTJ about the provision of  medical
    care for the child in India.

10. What matters is what the judge actually did with  the  evidence  before
    him.  He took into account the medical  condition  of  the  child.   He
    properly applied relevant case law in particular Akhalu (health  claim:
    ECHR Article 8) [2013] UKUT  400  (IAC)  when  considering  the  health
    issues of both the child and her mother.

11. I find this was a decision properly open to the judge on  the  evidence
    before him and  that  the  grounds  in  essence  amount  to  a  lengthy
    disagreement with the findings of the judge and an attempt  to  reargue
    the appeal.  I find that although the FtTJ misstated  Gulshan  at  �42,
    nevertheless it is not  material  to  the  outcome  because  the  judge
    carefully evaluated the  evidence  in  favour  of  the  appellants;  he
    applied  the  relevant  case  law  concerning  healthcare  issues   and
    considered the factors in favour of the appellants and  the  respondent
    before coming to a conclusion which was properly open  to  him  on  the
    evidence before him. It cannot be said he took into account  irrelevant
    factors or that he failed to take into account  relevant  factors  when
    reaching his decision. On any basis given the guidance  in  Akhalu  and
    the medical evidence before the Tribunal this is not  an  appeal  which
    could ever succeed under Article 8. In summary even  if  the  FtTJ  had
    properly set out the approach that he had to follow in �42 there  could
    be no other conclusion in the appeal than the one reached by  the  FtTJ
    because the FtTJ carried out within the body of his findings an Article
    8 assessment and reached  findings  properly  open  to  him  given  the
    evidence before him which he approached with care.

12. Accordingly  I  uphold  the  decision  of  the  FTTJ  and  dismiss  the
    application before the Tribunal.

Summary of Decision

The First-tier Tribunal decision is upheld.
