For the Appellant:     Mr C. Bates, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mrs Rafiq, Bellamy & Co.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. The Respondent is a national of Turkey born  in  1978.   On  the  9th
       January 2019 the First-tier Tribunal  (Judge  Cruthers)  allowed  his
       human rights appeal against the  Secretary  of  State's  decision  to
       deport him from the United Kingdom. Judge Woodcraft has  now  granted
       the Secretary of State permission to appeal against that decision.




       Background and Decision of the First-tier Tribunal

    2. The bare facts are as  follows.  The  Respondent  married  a  British
       national in Turkey  and  entered  this  country  on  a  valid  spouse
       settlement visa in August 2009.  That marriage, to K, still  subsists
       and they have two British children who live in  the  family  home  in
       Lancashire. They are today aged 2 and 8.  On the 16th  December  2010
       the Respondent was convicted on two counts of sexual activity with  a
       male child under 16. These convictions resulted in  him  receiving  a
       custodial  sentence  of  2  years  on  the  28th  January  2011.  The
       Respondent served one year of that sentence before being released  on
       licence into the community.  His name has been entered onto  the  Sex
       Offender Register for 10 years, and a  Sexual  Prevention  Order  was
       made for the same period.

    3. The Secretary of State notified the Respondent of  his  liability  to
       deportation on the 16th February 2011 and the Deportation  Order  was
       signed on the 21st February 2012.  The  Respondent's  appeal  against
       that decision was dismissed by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  McAll  in
       2012.

    4. Since that time the Respondent has continued to live with his family.
       He and his representatives have  maintained  contact  with  the  Home
       Office, sending  further  representations  in  April  and  May  2013,
       November 2015, March 2016 and June 2017.   No  action  was  taken  to
       implement the 2012 Deportation Order until on the 11th July 2018  the
       Secretary of State refused to revoke it. This  decision  triggered  a
       fresh appeal right which the Respondent exercised.

    5. The grounds of appeal before Judge Cruthers were a) protection and b)
       human rights. In respect of (b)  the  Respondent  feared  retributive
       attacks in Turkey because of the  nature  of  his  offences.   Whilst
       Judge Cruthers accepted that the Respondent may have a genuinely held
       subjective  fear  about  this,  the  evidence  fell  well  short   of
       establishing an objectively well-founded risk of harm. The protection
       appeal was accordingly dismissed and there has been no  challenge  to
       that decision.

    6. As to the human rights claim Judge Cruthers heard live evidence  from
       the Respondent, his wife of some eight years, K, and K's father.   He
       was provided with  written  evidence  from  a  number  of  additional
       witnesses, primarily members of K's family, all of whom spoke  highly
       of the Respondent. Particular emphasis was placed  on  the  assertion
       that the Respondent  is  the  primary  carer  for  the  couple's  two
       children, since K works full time.  She is employed by the NHS  as  a
       Critical Care  Nurse  and  is  currently  undertaking  a  BSc  degree
       permitting her to specialise in intensive care nursing.

    7. In his deliberations Judge Cruthers directed himself to  the  earlier
       decision of Judge McAll and indicated that he intended to  apply  the
       Devaseelan principles.  He identified the relevant  test  in  a  case
       such as this was whether the Respondent's  removal  from  the  United
       Kingdom would have "unduly harsh" consequences for  the  Respondent's
       British wife and/or children, that test being derived  from  s117C(5)
       of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (as amended), and
       as it is transposed to paragraph 399 of the Immigration Rules.   That
       paragraph required the Respondent to demonstrate that the  impact  on
       his children would  be  'unduly  harsh'  in  two  respects:  if  they
       remained here without their father, and if  they  went  with  him  to
       Turkey.  The  latter  question  had  already  been  conceded  by  the
       Secretary of State so the only issue for Judge Cruthers to decide was
       whether it would be 'unduly harsh' for these children to remain  here
       without the Respondent.

    8. He found, for the following reasons, that it was:

        i) The Respondent does not pose an ongoing and real 'danger to  the
           community' [�51-56];

       ii) Probation and social services have not considered  it  necessary
           to have any further involvement with the family [�79]

      iii) It "could not  be  clearer"  that  the  best  interests  of  the
           children would be served by having their father remain with them
           [�70]

       iv) The household is dependent upon the Respondent  undertaking  the
           majority of the childcare responsibilities [�77]

        v) In his absence K would have to  either  drastically  reduce  her
           hours or give up her career altogether [�77]

       vi) She has worked extremely hard in a  challenging  profession  and
           for her to have to give that up would be  unduly  harsh  on  her
           [�77]

      vii) The financial impact upon the family would be significant [�77]

     viii) The Respondent's  removal  would  have  a  "massive  detrimental
           impact" on his wife and sons, some 9 years after the crimes were
           committed [�78]

       ix) The younger child in particular would be affected,  his  primary
           attachment figure being his father [�80]

        x) The delay is relevant inasmuch as the Respondent may have  still
           been considered to pose a risk to children in 2012,  but  today,
           six years later with no further offending,  he  can  demonstrate
           that he is not [�82]. Furthermore his wife has during that  time
           invested in, and  advanced,  her  professional  career  and  the
           Respondent has acted as primary carer for his sons [�83].

    9. Judge Cruthers added, although this  was  not  part  of  his  'unduly
       harsh' assessment, that it would be contrary to the  public  interest
       if K were to leave her job or to significantly reduce her hours.




       The Appeal

   10. The Secretary of State now appeals on the following grounds:

        i) Impermissible speculation. The Tribunal found that K would  have
           to give up work if the  Respondent  were  to  be  deported.  The
           Secretary of State contends that this was not a finding open  to
           the Tribunal on the evidence before  it,  given  the  indication
           that she already receives assistance from her  own  family,  and
           the fact that other single parents manage to continue to work.

       ii) Misdirection on the public interest. The Tribunal found that  it
           was not in the public interest that a Critical Care  nurse  give
           up employment. This was not a finding open  to  it  because  the
           public interest in deportation appeals is set down  in  statute,
           and is heavily weighted in favour of deportation.

      iii) The finding that the family income would reduce is not in itself
           a factor capable of establishing  deportation  to  have  'unduly
           harsh consequences'.

       iv) Ditto re the finding that  some  of  the  children's  activities
           would have to be curtailed.

        v) The Tribunal has not made a  finding  to  the  effect  that  the
           children would not "be adequately cared for both physically  and
           or emotionally"  if  their  father  were  to  be  deported.  For
           instance, no medical needs have been identified.

       vi) The delay in taking action did not dilute the public interest in
           removal.

   11. For  the  Respondent  Mrs  Rafique  made  submissions  defending  the
       decision.




       Discussion and Findings

   12. Ground (i) is not made out. The  Tribunal  is  required  to  make  an
       assessment on the evidence that is before it, and  that  is  what  it
       did. It heard from K and members of K's family  and  it  plainly  had
       regard to the fact that the children's grandparents are  involved  to
       some extent in their care: see for instance paragraph 16. Having done
       so the Tribunal concluded that the likely outcome of the Respondent's
       deportation would be that his wife would need to  either  reduce  her
       working hours, or to give up work altogether. That was  a  reasonable
       and rational conclusion for the Tribunal to reach given the  evidence
       that she has been able to advance her a career, and  work  the  hours
       that she does, because her husband has been there  to  care  for  the
       children.  The Secretary of State  characterises  its  conclusion  as
       speculative but there is nothing speculative about it. That  was  K's
       credible assessment of her own position.  In fact it is the Secretary
       of State who invites speculation, by suggesting that the wider family
       could be expected to restructure their lives and commitments in order
       to fill the gap left by the removal of a full time parent.  There  is
       no evidential foundation for the conclusion  that  the  Secretary  of
       State invites this  Tribunal  to  draw  from  the  evidence.  On  the
       contrary, the evidence suggested that in fact the wider  family  were
       also dependent upon the Respondent to assist them: see  paragraph  12
       of the  determination  referring  to  the  evidence  of  K's  elderly
       grandmother to the effect that the Respondent "keeps an eye"  on  her
       when everyone else is out at work, performing  daily  tasks  such  as
       cleaning, shopping, gardening and DIY in her home.

   13. There is nothing to be gained from the Secretary  of  State  pointing
       out that there  are  other  single  parent  families  in  the  United
       Kingdom. That is true, but does nothing to undermine  the  conclusion
       reached by the First-tier Tribunal that in  this  case  it  would  be
       unduly harsh to expect their children to live without  their  father,
       who is their primary carer.

   14. There is no misdirection in the Tribunal having found that  it  would
       be in the public interest to have the skills of a critical care nurse
       retained by the NHS.    First of all I would note that this factor is
       expressly excluded from  the  'unduly  harsh'  assessment  so  is  in
       essence obiter. Secondly it  is  a  sentiment  that  is  in  my  view
       correct. In  assessing  proportionality  Tribunals  are  required  to
       conduct a global appraisal of all of the relevant circumstances.  The
       fact that this woman is a committed public servant  in  a  difficult,
       demanding and skilled role  was  one  facet  of  the  evidence  worth
       remarking upon.  Insofar as the grounds suggest that it  should  have
       been excluded because it does not appear in the list at Part 5 of the
       Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 that is specious. Whilst
       parliament there intended to  identify  factors  that  reflected  the
       public interest, it is not an exhaustive list.

   15. Grounds (iii) and (iv) are, as statements of law, perfectly  correct,
       but they are not an accurate representation of the reasoning  in  the
       determination. Judge Cruthers did not, for instance,  find  that  the
       reduction in family income would in itself render deportation  unduly
       harsh. He found that it was one factor to  consider  in  the  overall
       assessment of the best interests of these children, and ultimately in
       the assessment under s117C.

   16. Ground (v) appears to suggest that a child would need to  be  unwell,
       or in some way face neglect, for an appellant to  succeed  on  'undue
       harshness' grounds. That is fallacious. The  task  for  the  decision
       maker is to conduct a rounded assessment of whether that child in the
       particular  circumstances  of  the  case  would  face  unduly   harsh
       consequences should  the  parent  be  removed.  That  is  what  Judge
       Cruthers has done. Insofar as  Mr  Bates  submitted  that  there  was
       nothing that elevated this  case  above  the  'commonplace'  that  is
       simply incorrect. This is a family  where  the  prospective  deportee
       undertakes all of the primary childcare  responsibilities  and  where
       the children were found to face a  "massive  detrimental  impact"  if
       their father - the primary attachment figure - were  to  be  removed.
       These were moreover relationships  that  had  been  strengthened  and
       cemented during six years of Home Office  inaction,  that  being  the
       relevance of the delay.

   17. I find no error  of  law  in  the  determination  of  the  First-tier
       Tribunal.




       Anonymity

   18. The Appellant is a criminal and  his  identity  would  not  therefore
       ordinarily attract protection. His case involves however the presence
       in the United Kingdom of his two British children.

   19. I am concerned that identification of the  Appellant  could  lead  to
       identification of those children.

   20. As such I am satisfied,  having had regard to  the  guidance  in  the
       Presidential Guidance Note No 1 of 2013: Anonymity  Orders,  that  it
       would be appropriate to make an order in accordance with Rule  14  of
       the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 in  the  following
       terms:

           "Unless and until a tribunal or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
           Appellant is granted anonymity.  No report of these  proceedings
           shall directly or indirectly identify him or any member  of  his
           family.  This direction applies to,  amongst  others,  both  the
           Appellant and the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with  this
           direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"




       Decisions

   21. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contains no error of law
       and it is upheld.

   22. There is an order for anonymity.
