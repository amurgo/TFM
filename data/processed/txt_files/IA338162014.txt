                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge  Fowell  promulgated  14.1.15,  allowing  the
    claimant's appeal  against  the  decisions  of  the  respondent,  dated
    13.8.14, to refuse to vary leave to remain in the UK and to remove  him
    from the UK by way of directions under section 47  of  the  Immigration
    Asylum and Nationality Act 2006. The Judge heard the appeal on  5.1.15.



 2. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Davies  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    24.2.15.

 3. Thus the matter came before us on 7.5.15 as  an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 4. For the reasons set out herein we found errors of law in the making  of
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal such that the decision of Judge
    Fowell should be set aside and remade.

 5. The relevant background can  be  summarised  briefly  as  follows.  The
    claimant entered the UK in October 2009, aged 18, as a Tier 4 (General)
    Student with leave later extended  until  November  2013.  On  2.10.13,
    before expiry of his student leave, the claimant applied for  leave  to
    remain as a partner pursuant to Appendix FM of the  Immigration  Rules.
    The application was initially refused on 13.10.13, on  the  basis  that
    the evidence submitted did not meet the income  threshold  requirements
    of the Rules. However, the application was  'put  on  hold'  pending  a
    legal challenge to the judgement in MM & Others.  Having  succeeded  in
    that challenge, the Court of Appeal upholding  the  lawfulness  of  the
    income threshold of Appendix FM, the Secretary of State  revisited  the
    claimant's application, refusing it in the decision of 13.8.14, on  the
    basis of the failure of the  claimant  to  meet  the  income  threshold
    requirements. Whilst the claimant had provided further evidence of  his
    partner's income, the refusal decision  explained  that  only  evidence
    relating to income as at the date of application could  be  considered.
    The partner's income was below  the  �18,600  threshold  and  thus  the
    application was refused on that ground.

 6. In the alternative, the Secretary of  State  considered  the  exception
    under R-LTRP and EX1(b) of Appendix FM, but concluded that the claimant
    failed to  provide  any  evidence  of  'insurmountable  obstacles,'  as
    defined  by  EX2,  to  continuing  family  life  with  his  partner  in
    Bangladesh. The claimant and his partner do not have any  children  and
    thus EX1(a) does not apply.

 7. The Secretary of State also concluded that the claimant could not  meet
    the private life requirements of paragraph  276ADE,  as  he  could  not
    demonstrate  that  there  would  be  very  significant   obstacles   to
    integration into Bangladesh if required to leave the UK.

 8. Finally, the Secretary of  State  found  no  exceptional  circumstances
    warranting consideration of private and/or family life  rights  outside
    the Immigration Rules on the basis of article 8 ECHR.

 9. From �25 of the decision Judge Fowell proceeded on the 'common  ground'
    between the parties that  the  claimant  did  not  satisfy  the  income
    threshold requirements of Appendix FM, as specified under FM-SE. At �29
    the judge provided cogent reasons for that conclusion, but noting  that
    at any time after December 2013 the claimant could have  made  a  fresh
    application relying on subsequent pay evidence that  demonstrated  that
    his partner's income now met the income threshold, such that the  judge
    took the view that such an application was bound to succeed.

10. From �27 the judge explained why the late evidence did not  assist  the
    claimant as, although section 85(4)  of  the  2002  Act  permitted  the
    Tribunal to consider evidence about  any  matter  which  it  thinks  is
    relevant to the substance of  the  decision  including  evidence  which
    concerns a matter arising after the  date  of  decision,  the  claimant
    could only succeed by showing that the application he made  would  have
    been successful. The Rules, in particular FM-SE  paragraph  D,  require
    the income threshold evidence to be submitted with the application.  At
    that date the partner's income was  insufficient.  There  has  been  no
    appeal or cross-appeal against this part of the decision  and  it  must
    therefore stand.

11. There is no appeal or cross-appeal against the  subsequent  finding  of
    Judge Fowell at �30 of the decision that there were  no  insurmountable
    obstacles to continuing family life in  Bangladesh.  The  claimant  had
    relied on hostility towards him or Ms Nessa from  her  ex-husband,  but
    the judge was not satisfied that there was any such risk of  harm.  The
    judge found that the claimant would likely return  alone  and  make  an
    application for entry clearance from Bangladesh.

12. Neither is there any appeal or cross-appeal against the finding at  �32
    that the claimant could not demonstrate very significant  obstacles  to
    his integration into Bangladesh pursuant to  paragraph  276ADE  of  the
    Immigration Rules.

13. The difficulty with the decision is in the article 8 assessment outside
    the Rules, with the judge finding at �38 that the refusal decision  was
    not in accordance with the law, not necessary for the protection  of  a
    legitimate aim, and not  proportionate  to  the  claimant's  article  8
    private and family life rights.

14.  Mr  Clark  submitted  that  there  were  no  compelling  circumstances
    insufficiently recognised in the Immigration Rules to justify the judge
    going on to consider article 8 ECHR outside the Rules,  since  all  the
    relevant private and family life considerations were  incorporated  and
    already considered by the judge under paragraph 276ADE in  relation  to
    private life and under Appendix FM in relation to family life. We would
    agree with that submission. It does not necessarily follow that it is a
    material error of law for the judge to have considered article  8  ECHR
    outside the Rules. However, we find, for the reasons  set  out  herein,
    that  the  judge  made  material  errors  of  law  in  that  article  8
    assessment.

15. The finding at �35 of  the  decision  that  there  was  a  "potentially
    exceptional circumstance"  in  requiring  the  claimant  to  return  to
    Bangladesh purely for the purpose of submitted a fresh application from
    outside the UK cannot in itself amount to exceptional circumstances, as
    it is the requirement of the Rules. However, in  light  of  the  recent
    decision of R (on the application  of  Chen)  v  SSHD  (Appendix  FM  -
    Chikwamba - temporary separation -  proportionality)  IJR  [2015]  UKUT
    00189 (IAC), Mr Clark accepted that "there may be cases in which  there
    are no insurmountable obstacles to family life  being  enjoyed  outside
    the UK but where temporary separation to enable an individual  to  make
    an application for entry clearance may be disproportionate."

16. In the decision allowing the appeal the judge quoted  extensively  from
    Chikwamba v SSHD [2008] HL, a decision predating the  incorporation  of
    article 8 private and family  life  into  the  Immigration  Rules,  and
    failed to take account of later case authority,  including  R  (Kotecha
    and Das) v SSHD [2011] EWHC 2070 (Admin), explaining  that  Lord  Brown
    was  not  in  fact  laying  down  a  legal  test  that  it  would  only
    comparatively rarely be proportionate in a case involving  children  to
    require an applicant to apply from abroad. In any event, there  are  no
    children to consider in this case.

17. At �39 of Chen, Upper Tribunal Judge Gill stated:

         "In my judgement, if it is shown by an individual (the burden being
         upon him or her) that  an  application  for  entry  clearance  from
         abroad would  be  granted  and  that  there  would  be  significant
         interference with family life by temporary removal, the  weight  to
         be accorded to the formal requirement of obtaining entry  clearance
         is reduced.  In  cases  involving  children,  where  removal  would
         interfere with the child's enjoyment of family  life  with  one  or
         other of his or her parents whilst entry clearance is obtained,  it
         will be easier to show that the balance on proportionality falls in
         favour of the claimant than in cases which do not involve  children
         but where removal interferes with family life between  parties  who
         knowingly entered into  the  relationship  in  the  knowledge  that
         family life was being established whilst the immigration status  of
         one party was 'precarious.'"

18. The facts of Chen are in fact rather similar to those of  the  claimant
    in the present appeal. The Chinese appellant in that case  entered  the
    UK as a student but later met and married a British citizen of  Chinese
    parentage. The appellant had parents and  siblings  in  China.  It  was
    accepted that there were no insurmountable  obstacles  to  family  life
    between her and her  husband  being  enjoyed  in  China.  They  had  no
    children  and  there  was  nothing  to  demonstrate   any   significant
    interference with family life. The Tribunal found the decisions of  the
    Secretary of State refusing leave to  remain  outside  the  Immigration
    Rules were lawful and refused judicial review. In the present case  not
    only are their no children, but the claimant failed to demonstrate that
    there would be any significant interference with  family  life  by  his
    removal and anticipate that he may  make  a  further  application  from
    outside the UK, consistent with the  requirements  of  the  Immigration
    Rules.

19. Having considered the First-tier Tribunal Judge's article 8 assessment,
    we find that here is an insufficiency of cogent reasoning for  reaching
    the article 8 ECHR conclusions, and a clear inconsistency between those
    conclusions and preceding findings, particularly at �31 and �37. At �31
    the judge found that although the claimant's removal would involve some
    disruption to their family life, it does not involve  any  child.  "The
    appellant is a young and capable individual who came to  the  UK  as  a
    student 5 years ago, has no real family here, and would not be  subject
    to any undue hardship by having to return for a period  to  Bangladesh,
    let alone an unsurmountable (sic) obstacle." At  �32  the  judge  found
    that his family connections in Bangladesh would enable him to integrate
    without undue difficulty. At �37 the judge noted  that  the  claimant's
    return to Bangladesh would not affect any  children  and  he  would  no
    doubt be able to manage the  application  process  and  the  period  of
    separation. The judge went on to describe his removal as "comparatively
    low level of disruption" to his family life. The judge then found  that
    this  had  to  be  set  against  "the  overwhelming  prospect  of   his
    application being approved." It was apparently  conceded  by  the  Home
    Office Presenting Officer at the  First-tier  Tribunal  appeal  hearing
    that on the evidence then available, a fresh application would succeed.



20. However, it is difficult to  reconcile  the  above  findings  with  the
    conclusion at �38 of the decision that the "proposed removal  would  be
    an interference with the appellant's right to respect for  his  private
    and family life of sufficient gravity  as  potentially  to  engage  the
    operation of article 8." Not only is the conclusion  devoid  of  cogent
    reasoning, it flies in the face of all the earlier findings  suggesting
    a "comparatively low  level  of  disruption"  to  family  life.  It  is
    difficult to see how the decision can be said to  be  disproportionate.
    In the circumstances, it amounts to an  error  of  law  such  that  the
    decision in relation to article 8 ECHR is flawed and cannot stand.

21. Further, whilst the decision undoubtedly  interferes  with  the  family
    life of the claimant and his wife so as to engage article  8  following
    the Razgar stepped approach, the judge has given no reasons for finding
    that the decision is not in accordance with the law. We find  that  the
    removal would  be  entirely  in  accordance  with  the  law,  it  being
    consistent with the Immigration  Rules  and  the  statutory  basis  for
    removal. In addition, the finding that the removal is not necessary  to
    a legitimate aim is not justified, ignoring both case law  and  section
    117B(1) of the 2002 Act to the effect that immigration  control  is  in
    the public interest and necessary to protect the economic well-being of
    the UK, as held in Shahzad (Art 8: legitimate aim) [204] UKUT 85.

22. With reference to section 117B, we accept Mr Hossain's submissions that
    the claimant speaks English and  that  in  reliance  on  his  partner's
    income he is financially independent, that income exceeding the  income
    support level. Further, whilst we find that the  claimant's  status  in
    the UK as a student was precarious, section 117B in that regard relates
    only to private life and not a relationship developed with  a  partner.
    In the circumstances, the weight to be accorded to the public  interest
    considerations of section 117B lie  only  in  relation  to  immigration
    control being in the public interest.

23. Mr Hossain submitted that the claimant would not in fact be required to
    leave the UK in order to make a further application under Appendix  FM,
    as he had leave at the time of his application, which continues  during
    the appeal process by reason of section 3C, and he would also  have  28
    days following an unfavourable decision within which to  make  a  fresh
    application. In those circumstances, it is difficult to understand  how
    the refusal decision, effectively requiring  the  claimant  to  make  a
    fresh application, could  be  disproportionate  to  his  family  and/or
    private life. However, according to Mr Hossain,  the  partner's  income
    has reduced since the First-tier Tribunal appeal  hearing  and  is  now
    approximately �15,500, so that he would not now be  able  to  meet  the
    requirements if he were to make a fresh application, whether in country
    or from Bangladesh. That submission rather  undermines  the  claimant's
    reliance on the Chikwamba premise. Nevertheless, it is not the function
    of the Tribunal or article  8  to  protect  the  claimant  against  the
    potential negative outcome of any future application not yet  made  and
    thus not yet considered by the Secretary of State. Article 8 is  not  a
    shortcut to compliance with the Immigration Rules  and  the  claimant's
    case is not strengthened by the degree to which he does  not  meet  the
    requirements of the Rules.

Conclusion & Decision:

24. For the reasons set out above, we find that the making of the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did involve the making  of  an  error  on  a
    point of law such  that  the  decision  should  be  set  aside.  Having
    indicated that decision to the representatives of the  parties  at  the
    hearing before us, we invited submissions as  to  whether  any  further
    evidence or submissions were necessary before we proceeded  to  re-make
    the decision in the appeal. Both agreed that no  further  evidence  was
    necessary and both relied on the submissions already  made  as  to  the
    error of law issue.

25. For the reasons set out above, it necessarily follows that  the  appeal
    must be dismissed. The claimant does not meet the requirements  of  the
    Rules for leave to remain. We were not satisfied that on the  facts  of
    this  case  there  are  any  compelling  or  exceptional  circumstances
    insufficiently recognised in the Rules so as to justify considering the
    private and family life claims  outside  the  Rules  on  the  basis  of
    article 8 ECHR. All the relevant factors have already  been  considered
    within  the  discussion  above  as  to  the  claimant's  compliance  or
    otherwise with the Immigration Rules. In any event, even on an  article
    8 ECHR assessment of private and family life rights, we find,  for  the
    clear reasons set out above, that in balancing the claimant's rights on
    the one hand against on the other the legitimate and necessary  aim  to
    protect the economic well-being of the UK by  immigration  control  the
    balance comes down against the claimant and in favour  of  removal.  In
    the circumstances, we find that the decision of the Secretary of  State
    was entirely proportionate.

                    We set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

                    We re-make the decision in the appeal by dismissing it.

Anonymity

We have considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, we make no anonymity order.


Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of our decision, we have  considered  whether  to  make  a  fee
award (rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration  Tribunal  (Procedure)
Rules 2005 and section 12(4)(a) of the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement
Act 2007).

We make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed and thus there can be no fee award.
