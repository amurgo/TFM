For the Respondent:    Ms A Everett, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against the decision issued on 21 March 2018 of First-
    Tier Tribunal Judge Page which refused Ms Bakare's appeal  against  the
    refusal of a residence card showing her status as someone married to an
    EEA national exercising Treaty rights.

 2. Ms Bakare is a citizen of Nigeria and was born on  22  May  1970.   She
    bases her claim that she  is  entitled  to  a  residence  card  on  her
    marriage to Mr Nuno Vilela Ribeiro, a Portuguese national.

 3. This error of law decision and the re-making of the appeal can  be  set
    out relatively briefly as there was agreement between the parties as to
    the disposal of the appeal and that agreement was entirely in line with
    my own view of the case.

 4. The First-Tier Tribunal found that the appellant and Mr Ribeiro were in
    a genuine and subsisting marriage and that Mr  Ribeiro  was  exercising
    Treaty rights. The appeal was refused only for the reason  set  out  at
    [11]:

         "I am unable to conclude that the appellant has submitted  a  valid
         Portuguese passport for the Sponsor as required for  the  issue  of
         residence card under regulation 15."

 5. There was consensus that the reasoning that led to this conclusion  was
    based on a material error of fact. The evidence  provided  showed  that
    passport number L8***** had been lost when submitted  with  an  earlier
    application even though it had been sent to the respondent by  recorded
    delivery by legal advisers and those advisers sought an explanation for
    the passport not being in the respondent's file. When it could  not  be
    located, Mr Ribeiro reported the loss of  that  passport.  He  obtained
    another passport with  the  number  MO9****.  He  never  reported  that
    passport as lost and merely replaced it on expiry with passport  number
    L7*****. The respondent's refusal letter was wrong to suggest otherwise
    and the First-Tier Tribunal incorrect in so finding, seeming to confuse
    the evidence provided in the witness  statements  and  the  appellant's
    bundle on the history of the three passports. Ms Everett confirmed that
    the entry on the respondent's GCID  concerning  the  loss  of  passport
    number MO9**** was inexplicable and that the evidence  clearly  pointed
    to the facts being as set out above.

 6. I therefore found that the decision of the First-Tier Tribunal that  no
    valid Portuguese passport was provided for Mr Ribeiro was in  error  as
    it relied on a material error of fact. I re-made the appeal as  allowed
    when the evidence clearly showed that a valid passport was provided and
    that the EEA Regulations were therefore met in full.

Decision

 7. The decision of the First-Tier Tribunal discloses an error on  a  point
    of law and is set aside.

 8. The appeal is allowed under the EEA Regulations.
