                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

      1. The appellant is a national  of  Pakistan.  He  made  a  claim  for
         protection which was refused. He said  he  is  a  Shia  Muslim  who
         helped organise a  religious  procession.  This  brought  him  into
         conflict with another religious group. The appellant's account  was
         not believed by the respondent. At his  screening  and  substantive
         interview he said that he suffered from depression and  had  memory
         problems.

      2. His appeal was heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge Colvin at  Taylor
         House on 25 January  2019.  The  parties  were  represented.  In  a
         decision promulgated on 12 February 2019 his claim  was  dismissed.
         In the decision the judge  sets  out  the  appellant's  immigration
         history and details of his claim. The reasons for refusal are  then
         set out. The decision records the submissions and  notes  that  the
         appellant's representative, Prof Rees, expressed concern about  the
         appellant's mental health in light of his oral testimony.

      3. The decision records the appellant giving evidence  and  responding
         to cross-examination. Within the papers was a psychologist  report.
         Under the heading `Findings and Consideration 'the  judge  recorded
         at paragraph 25 that in the course of the hearing the appellant was
         having great difficulty understanding the questions and being  able
         to focus so as to provide a relevant answer. The judge referred  to
         his representative's submissions that he was  concerned  about  the
         appellant's mental health and his capacity to  give  evidence.  The
         judge went on to say:

             "25. It became apparent during the course of the  appeal  that
             the  appellant   was   having   great   difficulty   in   both
             understanding the questions that were put  to  him  and  being
             able to focus on an answer that was relevant to the particular
             question. It was an account of this that Prof  Rees  made  the
             submission about being concerned as to the appellants'  mental
             health condition and his capacity to give evidence.  I  am  of
             the same opinion and had reached the same conclusion  that  it
             became apparent rather late in the appeal that this is a  case
             where it was essential to have had a full medical report which
             dealt with  the  question  of  the  appellant  being  able  to
             understand the appeal proceedings  including  giving  evidence
             and answering questions.

             26.  It means that on the evidence before  me  I  have  little
             option but to  acknowledge  that  the  reasons  given  in  the
             respondent's refusal letter  are  justified  in  refusing  the
             appellant's asylum claim as the appellant appeared  unable  to
             give either a  consistent,  coherent  or  rational  answer  to
             questions put in cross-examination based  on  those  findings.
             However, although this inevitably leads to the  asylum  appeal
             being dismissed, I  nevertheless  consider  that  this  appeal
             hearing did not provide the appellant with  a  reasonable  and
             fair opportunity to have his case  properly  assessed  in  the
             absence of medical evidence detailing his capacity to be  able
             to present his case. It is therefore likely that such  medical
             evidence will now be submitted to the Home Office and  it  may
             well be appropriate that further consideration be given to the
             appellant's claim in light of this."

The Upper Tribunal

      4. Permission to  appeal  was  granted  on  the  basis  that  to  have
         proceeded in the circumstance arguably was a  procedural  error  of
         law. The judge had commented on the  appellant's  presentation  and
         expressed concerns about his mental  health  and  ability  to  give
         evidence. In the application, Counsel for the appellant  said  that
         he  had  applied  for  an   adjournment   given   the   appellant's
         presentation and so that medical evidence could be produced. In the
         alternative, he suggested time be  allowed  so  they  can  consider
         whether the appeal should be  withdrawn  and  a  fresh  application
         made.

      5. Ms Cunha accepts that in the circumstances  there  was  a  material
         procedural error rendering the decision unsafe. She suggested  that
         the  judge  should  have  adjourned   to   give   the   appellant's
         representatives an opportunity to obtain medical  evidence  and  to
         consider their position. There was no reference by the judge to the
         Guidelines in respect of vulnerable witnesses.

Conclusion

      6. I agree that the  decision  as  it  stands  is  unsafe  because  of
         concerns about the appellant's mental health and  ability  to  give
         evidence. The judge accepted this but nevertheless  continued  with
         the hearing. The judge specifically acknowledged  that  because  of
         this the appeal hearing did not provide him with a fair opportunity
         to  have  his  case   properly   assessed.   In   light   of   this
         acknowledgement the judge clearly erred in continuing.

Decision

The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Colvin materially errs in law  and
is set aside. The decision is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for  a  de
novo hearing.


Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Farrelly.





Directions

    1.   Relist for a de novo hearing in the First-tier Tribunal at  Taylor
    House excluding Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Colvin.

    2.   The appellant's representative should arrange medical evidence  in
    relation to the appellant's mental ability to give  evidence  before  a
    tribunal

    3.   An  oral  case  management  review  with  the  representatives  in
    attendance should be held before the  substantive  relisting.  At  that
    stage the medical evidence should  be  available.  If  the  appellant's
    representatives conclude that he is  a  vulnerable  witness  then  they
    should be in a position to direct  the  tribunal  to  the  evidence  in
    support of this and  the  relevant  sections  of  the  equal  treatment
    guidance. They should be in a position to advise  the  tribunal  as  to
    suggested steps to facilitate the  appellant's  participation  and  the
    fair progress of his hearing.

    4.   When a substantive  hearing  is  being  arranged  the  appellant's
    representative should advise if the appellant will be giving  evidence.
    If so, then a Punjabi interpreter will  be  required  and  they  should
    advise the tribunal.

    5.   A hearing time of around 2 ï¿½ hours is anticipated.
