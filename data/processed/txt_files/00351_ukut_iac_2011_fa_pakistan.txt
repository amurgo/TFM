In order to have made false representations or submitted false documents  so
as to attract a mandatory refusal under Part 9 of the Immigration Rules,  an
applicant must have deliberately practised 'Deception', as defined  at  para
6. Failing to disclose a material fact is also classed as  'Deception'.   It
follows that such failure also  requires  dishonesty  on  the  part  of  the
applicant, or by someone acting on his behalf.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.  The appellant arrived here from Pakistan on 3 September 2009 with  entry
clearance as a student, which conferred leave to  enter  until  31  December
2010.  On 21 August 2010 the appellant,  who  has  been  living  in  Ilford,
travelled for the first time by rail to Gravesend, thinking  that  he  could
use his Oyster Card, which still had �15  in  credit.   On  the  way  there,
however, a ticket inspector told him that his Oyster Card was not valid  for
travel on that route, and that he ought to have bought a  ticket  in  London
before setting off.  The appellant supplied his name  and  address,  and  in
due course he received a letter from North Kent Magistrates'  Court,  asking
whether he admitted having travelled  on  the  railway  without  paying  the
fare.  The appellant wrote back with the  requisite  admission,  and  on  11
October 2010 a "Notice of Fine and Collection Order" was sent to him by  the
Magistrates'  Court.   He  had  been  fined  �80,  to   which   were   added
compensation of �4.50, a victim surcharge of �15 and costs of �35, making  a
total of �134.50.  That the appellant did not realize  that  he  now  had  a
criminal conviction was  accepted  by  Immigration  Judge  Talbot  when  the
current appeal came before him the following year.

2. On 16 December  2010  the  appellant  made  an  in-time  application  for
further leave to remain. Among the questions posed in the Tier  4  (General)
Application Form, such as whether the applicant was guilty of war crimes  or
genocide, was question E1:


      "Has the student had any criminal convictions in the United Kingdom or
      any other country (including traffic offences) or any civil  judgments
      made against them?"

3.  To this question the appellant ticked the 'No' box.   When  he  received
the decision on his application, in a letter dated 11 February 2011, he  was
told that he  had  scored  30  points  for  Attributes  and  10  points  for
Maintenance, which would normally have satisfied  the  requirements  of  the
Points Based System.  But paragraph 245ZX(a) of HC 395 stipulates that  "the
applicant must not fall for refusal under the general grounds for  refusal",
and the application was indeed said to fall for refusal under one  of  those
general grounds,  namely  paragraph  322(1A).   This  provides  a  mandatory
ground on which variation of leave to remain is to be refused:

      "where false representations have been  made  or  false  documents  or
      information have been  submitted  (whether  or  not  material  to  the
      application, and whether or not  to  the  applicant's  knowledge),  or
      material  facts  have  not  been  disclosed,  in   relation   to   the
      application."

4.  The refusal letter does not cite any of the above wording, and does  not
specify which of the various subdivisions of the rule is being relied on  to
justify refusal, but simply tells the appellant  that  his  application  has
been refused under paragraphs 322(1A) and 245ZX(a) of the Immigration  Rules
because of the answer which he gave to question E1 of his Application  Form.
 "I am satisfied", says the author  of  the  letter,  "that  you  have  used
deception in this application."

5.  An appeal was duly lodged with the  First-tier  Tribunal,  and  when  it
came before Immigration Judge Talbot on 15 April 2011 copies were handed  up
of FW (Paragraph 322; untruthful answer) Kenya [2010] UKUT  165  (IAC),  the
head note to which reads as follows:

      "When a direct question is asked, and answered untruthfully, there  is
      both a false representation and a non-disclosure; and it is  not  open
      to an Appellant who gives an untruthful answer to a direct question in
      an application form to say that the matter was not material."

6.  This was a  case,  very  similar  to  the  instant  case,  in  which  an
applicant had wrongly answered 'No' to question E1 on his application  form,
asking whether he had any  criminal  convictions.   This  was  said  in  the
refusal letter to be both a false statement  and  the  non-disclosure  of  a
material fact, the author of  the  letter  also  being  satisfied  that  the
applicant had "used deception".  The Vice-Presidential panel took the  view,
which was the received wisdom at the time, that it did  not  matter  whether
the maker of false representations  had  made  an  honest  mistake.  It  was
enough that the information given was inaccurate.  This view  was  corrected
in Adedoyin - also known as AA (Nigeria) [2010] EWCA  Civ  773,  holding  at
paragraph  76  that  "[d]ishonesty  or  deception  is  needed,  albeit   not
necessarily  that  of  the   applicant   himself,   to   render   a   'false
representation' a ground for mandatory refusal."  It  was  to  AA  (Nigeria)
rather than FW (Kenya) that Judge Talbot turned  for  guidance,  and  having
found that the appellant had not been dishonest when he ticked the 'No'  box
on the application form,  he  concluded  that  he  had  not  made  a  'false
representation' in the required sense.

7.  The judge then turned, however, to the 'material non-disclosure'  aspect
of paragraph 322(1A).  Although the refusal letter was silent  as  to  which
aspect of the rule was being relied on, saying only that the  appellant  had
"used deception", the Presenting Officer canvassed this aspect before  Judge
Talbot, who agreed that the question whether the appellant  had  a  criminal
conviction was material to the application.  That,  he  concluded,  was  the
end of the matter.  The  non-disclosure  was  material,  and  therefore  the
appeal  fell  to  be  dismissed.   Nothing  was  said  about   whether   the
appellant's state of mind was relevant to this aspect of the rule.

8.  Permission was sought to appeal to the Upper Tribunal,  on  the  grounds
that material non-disclosure ought to be treated in the same  way  as  false
representations, so that dishonesty would be required for both.   Permission
was indeed given, and when the matter came before me today  I  came  to  the
conclusion, after hearing submissions from  the  two  representatives,  that
dishonesty is indeed required for all aspects of  paragraph  322(1A).   True
it is that at paragraph 69 of his leading judgment  in  AA  (Nigeria),  Lord
Justice Rix declined to  say  anything  about  the  material  non-disclosure
aspect of the rule, because "the rule does not at this point speak in  terms
of what is 'false'... In my judgment,  it  cannot  be  decisive  as  to  the
meaning of  'false'."   The  court  confined  itself  to  construing  'false
representations', but it seems to me that  the  material  on  the  basis  of
which  Rix  LJ  concluded   that   dishonesty   is   required   for   'false
representations' applies equally to  the  interpretation  of  non-disclosure
within the context of paragraph 322(1A).

9.  I turn first to paragraph 320(7B), under which a previous breach of  the
UK's immigration laws attracts a mandatory refusal of entry clearance.   One
such breach is "(d) using Deception in an application for  entry  clearance,
leave to enter or remain (whether successful or not)."  The  refusal  letter
in the instant case  told  the  appellant  that  he  had  "used  deception",
although without a capital D.  The capital letter  suggests  that  Deception
is a term of art, and indeed it is defined as follows at paragraph 6 of  the
Immigration Rules:

      "'Deception' means making false representations  or  submitting  false
      documents (whether or not material to the application), or failing  to
      disclose material facts."

10.   The  association  of  Deception  with  false  representations  was   a
principal reason why Rix  LJ  held  that  dishonesty  was  required.   Since
failure to disclose material facts  is  also  a  species  of  Deception,  by
parity of reasoning  that  too  requires  dishonesty  on  the  part  of  the
applicant.  The  theme  of  Deception  runs  through  the  guidance  in  the
Immigration Directorates' Instructions given  to  UKBA  caseworkers  on  the
application of paragraph 322(1A), which  is  headed  'Deception  used  in  a
current application' and encompasses false representations, false  documents
or information, and non-disclosure of material facts.  Paragraph 320(7A)  is
in identical terms to  paragraph  322(1A),  and  Chapter  26  of  the  Entry
Clearance Guidance uses a similar rubric for the benefit of entry  clearance
officers considering that rule: 'RFL04 Deception in an application'.

11.  But Rix LJ places particular weight on a letter of 4  April  2008  from
Liam  Byrne,  then  the  Immigration  Minister,  expanding  upon  what   his
colleague, Lord Bassam, had said in a recent debate in the  House  of  Lords
about the newly inserted  paragraphs  320(7A),  320(7B)  and  322(1A).   The
following passage from Mr Byrne's letter is highlighted at paragraph  37  of
AA (Nigeria):

      "The new Rules are intended to cover people who tell lies - either  on
      their own behalf or that of someone else - in an application to the UK
      Borders Agency.  They  are  not  intended  to  catch  those  who  make
      innocent mistakes in their applications."

12.  His Lordship makes the following comment about  the  above  passage  at
paragraph 44 of his judgment:

      "[Mr Byrne] means exactly that : he is asked for an assurance that the
      assurance [Lord Bassam] gave in the Lords debate about false documents
      applies  also  to  false   representations,   and   supports   it   by
      demonstrating that published guidance puts false documents  and  false
      representations (and for good measure false information) all  in  pari
      materia."

13.  It would be illogical to treat the  non-disclosure  of  material  facts
otherwise than in pari materia with the rest  of  paragraph  322(1A).   That
indeed is how Mr Ockelton treated it  in  FW  (Kenya),  a  case  which  also
involved an applicant answering 'No'  to  question  E1  on  his  application
form, asking whether he had any criminal convictions.   At  paragraph  9  of
the determination we read:

      "The truth of the matter is that this is a  case  where  there  is  no
      essential difference between false representation and  non-disclosure.
      The non-disclosure was a  false  representation,  because  it  was  an
      answer to a direct question.  The  answer  'no'  was  both  false  and
      constituted a failure to disclose what would have  been  disclosed  if
      the question had been answered truthfully.  That is not  to  say  that
      there is always no difference between false  representation  and  non-
      disclosure.  If, for example, an application form contained a space in
      which an applicant was invited to disclose anything  else  he  thought
      might be of relevance in deciding whether he should be granted  leave,
      and he left that part of the form blank, it might be found that he had
      failed  to  disclose  a  material  fact,  without   making   a   false
      representation.  But that is not this case."

14.  I respectfully  adopt  the  Vice-President's  reasoning  in  the  above
passage.  In many, if not most, cases  false  representations  and  material
non-disclosure will be opposite sides of the same coin.   If  the  applicant
has failed to disclose a material fact  he  will  also  have  made  a  false
representation, and vice versa.  Of course,  at  the  time  when  the  Upper
Tribunal 'reported' FW (Kenya) it was thought to be irrelevant  whether  the
applicant had intended to deceive or had made an honest mistake.  Thanks  to
AA (Nigeria), we now know that the applicant's state of mind is  crucial  to
determining whether he made  false  representations.   Where  material  non-
disclosure is the opposite side of the same coin,  it  would  be  illogical,
and indeed unfair, if an  applicant  who  had  honestly  made  an  incorrect
representation could nonetheless  have  his  application  refused,  and  his
appeal dismissed, on the basis that he had not disclosed a material fact.

15.  All aspects of paragraph 322(1A) and  its  sister  paragraphs  320(7A),
321(i) and 321A(2) are treated as 'Deception' under paragraph 6 of  HC  395,
which strongly implies that  mens  rea  is  required  on  the  part  of  the
applicant.  If that  were  not  so,  it  would  lead  to  the  extraordinary
situation that a person who had made a perfectly honest mistake  in  filling
out his application form for further leave to remain would be subject  to  a
re-entry ban  under  paragraph  320(7B)(d)  for  "using  Deception"  in  his
previous  application.   The  consequence  is  positively  draconian   under
paragraph  320(7B)(d)(ii)  if  an  applicant  for  entry   clearance   "used
Deception" in a previous application for entry clearance.  The re-entry  ban
would be for ten years.  That can hardly be the intended  consequence  of  a
wholly inadvertent failure to answer correctly one of the  questions  in  an
application  form.   To  include  such  a  failure  under  the   rubric   of
'Deception' would divorce that word,  used  as  a  term  of  art,  from  its
ordinary meaning, which is not the way in which the  Immigration  Rules  are
normally construed.

16.  The above reasoning is, I think, compatible with  FW  [2011]  EWCA  Civ
264, in which FW (Kenya) went on appeal  from  the  Upper  Tribunal  to  the
Court of Appeal.  The grounds of appeal ran  to  almost  four  pages,  which
Lord Justice Moore-Bick thought excessively long (although not,  it  has  to
be said, unusually long in this jurisdiction).  But the  court  had  nothing
to say about the correct interpretation  of  material  non-disclosure.   The
appellant had been found at first instance  to  have  deliberately  given  a
wrong answer to question E1  in  the  application  form.   So  although  the
Tribunal had been wrong to suppose that the appellant's state of  mind  when
he gave that answer  was  irrelevant,  he  had  in  fact  been  deliberately
dishonest, and so there was no error of law in the finding that he had  made
false  representations.   That  outcome  is  certainly  compatible  with   a
requirement for dishonesty in material non-disclosure as well.

17.  In the instant case, on the contrary, Immigration  Judge  Talbot  found
that the appellant had not been dishonest.   It  was  an  error  of  law  to
suppose that this finding was irrelevant to the question whether  there  had
been non-disclosure of a material fact.  The appeal  should  not  have  been
dismissed just because the fact was material.  The First-tier  determination
is therefore set aside, and the decision on the appeal must now be  re-made.
 As the respondent acknowledged in the refusal  letter,  the  appellant  has
scored sufficient points to satisfy the requirements  of  the  Points  Based
System.  It having been found that the general grounds for  refusal  do  not
apply to the present case, it follows that the appeal must be allowed.

DECISION

18. The appeal is allowed under the Immigration Rules.
