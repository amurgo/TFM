|DETERMINATION AND REASONS                                          |


For the appellant:           Ms A Jones, of Counsel, instructed by
                       Bhogal Lal, Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr G Phillips, Home Office Presenting Officer

Devaseelan does not purport to deal with decisions relating  to  the  family
member although increasingly it is misunderstood by  Adjudicators  as  doing
so.    It deals only with the situation where a human rights claim  is  made
by someone whose asylum appeal has already  failed  and  a  credibility  and
factual matrix been found by the first Adjudicator.

      "39.  In our view the second Adjudicator should treat matters  in  the
           following way.


            (1)   The first Adjudicator's determination should always be the
           starting-point.  It  is  the  authoritative  assessment  of  the
           appellant's status at the time was made.   In  principle  issues
           such as  whether  the  appellant  was  properly  represented  or
           whether he gave evidence, are irrelevant to this.


             (2)     Facts   happening   since   the   first   Adjudicator's
           determination can always be taken into  account  by  the  second
           Adjudicator.  If those facts lead the second Adjudicator to  the
           conclusion that, at the date of his  determination  and  on  the
           material before him, the appellant makes his  case,  so  be  it.
           The  previous  decision,  on  the  material  before  the   first
           Adjudicator and at that date, is not inconsistent.


             (3)    Facts   happening   before   the   first   Adjudicator's
           determination but having no relevance to the issues  before  him
           can always be taken into account by the second Adjudicator.  The
           first Adjudicator will not have been concerned with such  facts,
           and his determination is not an assessment of them.

       40.  We now pass to matters that could have  been  before  the  first
           Adjudicator but were not.


            (4)   Facts personal to the appellant that were not  brought  to
           the attention of  the  first  Adjudicator,  although  they  were
           relevant to the issues before him,  should  be  treated  by  the
           second  Adjudicator  with  the  greatest   circumspection.    An
           appellant who seeks, in a later appeal, to add to the  available
           facts in an effort  to  obtain  a  more  favourable  outcome  is
           properly regarded with suspicion  from  the  point  of  view  of
           credibility.  (Although considerations of credibility  will  not
           be relevant in cases where the existence of the additional  fact
           is beyond dispute).  It must also be  borne  in  mind  that  the
           first Adjudicator's determination was made at a  time  close  to
           the events alleged and in terms of both fact-finding and general
           credibility assessment would tend to have  the  advantage.   For
           this reason, the addiction of such facts should not usually lead
           to any reconsideration of the conclusions reached by  the  first
           Adjudicator.


            (5)   Evidence of other facts - for example country evidence may
           not suffer from the same concerns as to credibility, but  should
           be treated with caution.  The reason is different from  that  in
           (4).  Evidence dating from before the determination of the first
           Adjudicator might  well  have  been  relevant  if  it  had  been
           tendered to him: but it was not, and he made  his  determination
           without it.  The situation in the appellant's own country at the
           time of that determination is very unlikely to  be  relevant  in
           deciding whether the appellant's removal  at  the  time  of  the
           second  Adjudicator's  determination  would  breach  his   human
           rights.   Those  representing  the  appellant  would  be  better
           advised to assemble up-to-date evidence than to rely on material
           that is (ex hypothesi) now rather dated.


        41. The final major category of case is where the  appellant  claims
           that his removal would breach Article 3 for the same reason that
           he claimed to be a refugee.


            (6)   If before the second Adjudicator the appellant  relies  on
           facts are not materially different from those put to  the  first
           Adjudicator, and proposes to support the claim is in essence the
           same evidence as that available to the appellant at  that  tine,
           the second Adjudicator should regard the issues  as  settled  by
           the first Adjudicator's determination and make his  findings  in
           line with that determination rather than allowing the matter  to
           be re-litigated.  We draw attention  to  the  phrase  'the  same
           evidence as that available to the appellant at the time  of  the
           first determination.  We have chosen this  phrase  not  only  in
           order to accommodate guidelines (4)  and  (5)  above,  but  also
           because, in respect  of  evidence  that  was  available  to  the
           appellant, he must be taken to have made his choices  about  hot
           it would be presented.   An  appellant  cannot  be  expected  to
           present evidence of which he  has  no  knowledge:  but  if  (for
           example) he chooses not to  give  oral  evidence  in  his  first
           appeal, that does not mean that  the  issues  or  the  available
           evidence in the second appeal are rendered any different by  his
           proposal to give oral evidence  (of  the  same  facts)  on  this
           occasion."

Accordingly, the Adjudicator misdirected herself and that misdirection  runs
so deeply through the determination that the Tribunal is unable  to  find  a
usual core of facts to  which  could  apply  the  present  law  and  country
situation.

There is therefore no alternative but to allow this appeal and remit it  for
hearing afresh.

The appeal is accordingly allowed and we direct  that  it  be  remitted  for
hearing afresh by an Adjudicator other than Miss Avril Harrison.
