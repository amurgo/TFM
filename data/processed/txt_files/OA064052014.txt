                            DECISION AND REASONS
                             EXTEMPORE JUDGMENT

 1. The Appellant appeals  a  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  made
    following a hearing of 22nd May 2015 in which the judge  dismissed  her
    appeal against the refusal of entry clearance as a fiancï¿½e.  The  judge
    found that the Appellant had not produced her Sponsor's  final  divorce
    document as she had indicated as being attached to her Notice of Appeal
    and that accordingly the Entry Clearance  Officer's  concerns  that  no
    decree absolute had been issued so that the intention  of  the  Sponsor
    and the ability of the Sponsor  to  enter  into  a  marriage  with  the
    Appellant was made out.

 2. I note from the file that in fact the decree absolute was  attached  to
    the Notice of Appeal as served upon the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  and
    Tribunal.  The appeal grounds  are  dated  20th  May  2014.   In  those
    circumstances I am satisfied that  the  Tribunal  Judge's  decision  is
    vitiated  by  error  in  that  a  significant  piece  of  evidence  was
    overlooked.

 3. I am satisfied that the error is material in the sense that I cannot be
    sure that had the judge seen that document that the decision would have
    been the same and accordingly I set that decision aside.   The  parties
    having been notified that in the event that I  should  do  so  today  I
    would be remaking the decision, I find it appropriate  to  continue  to
    proceed to remake the decision.

 4. The Appellant is out of country and accordingly is not before  me,  and
    in those circumstances I find it appropriate to exercise my  discretion
    under Rule 38 of the Upper Tribunal  Procedure  Rules  and  proceed  to
    determine the appeal in the absence of the  Appellant.   The  Appellant
    had requested in any event a paper hearing  and  of  course  cannot  be
    before me and has not elected to instruct a representative to appear.

 5. In determining the substance of  the  appeal  I  find  that  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer has failed to provide the  evidence  upon  which  the
    decision is predicated.  There is no Respondent's bundle.  I note  that
    the substantive issue in terms of the ability of the parties  to  marry
    was resolved by the production of the  decree  absolute,  and  in  that
    regard I am satisfied that there is no  countervailing  evidence  going
    against the Appellant's assertion of a genuine intention to marry.

 6. Looking at the evidence that  was  available  to  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer as is reflected in the decision I note that the Respondent does
    not dispute that the Appellant and her Sponsor  have  met,  and  indeed
    that seems to have been corroborated by the  conversation  between  the
    Respondent ECO and the Sponsor.

 7. Further the position was evidenced by way of  documentary  support  for
    the application both in terms of the Sponsor's  financial  position  as
    well as statements going to the subsistence  of  the  relationship  not
    only made by the Sponsor but also made by third party witnesses.   None
    of that evidence is significantly  contested  in  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer's reasoning.

 8. The  Entry  Clearance  Officer  does  complain  that  the  photographic
    evidence which has been submitted of the couple together does not carry
    with it any determinative evidence of the date  upon  which  they  were
    taken.  I do not see how that takes the matter any  further  as  it  is
    self-evident that the evidence is of the couple being in the same place
    at the same time and had the Entry  Clearance  Officer  had  reason  to
    doubt the fact of the relationship he or she  had  the  opportunity  of
    raising that directly with the Sponsor and plainly the  inference  must
    be  that  the  Sponsor  has  continued  to  support   the   application
    throughout.

 9. Standing back and looking at the evidence in the round I  am  satisfied
    that the Appellant has established to the standard of  the  balance  of
    probabilities that the relationship with the Sponsor  was  genuine  and
    subsisting as at the date of the refusal decision on 8th April 2014 and
    that the couple intended to live together  permanently  in  the  United
    Kingdom in the  context  of  a  marriage  taking  place  following  the
    permanent breakdown of the previous relationship of the Sponsor to  the
    point that all the requirements set out at E-ECP.2.6, 2.8, 2.9 and 2.10
    were met.

10. No other reason for refusal remaining, it  follows  that  I  allow  the
    Appellant's appeal.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier tribunal reveals an error of law.  I  set  it
aside and remake the decision by allowing the appeal  on  immigration  rules
grounds.

No anonymity direction is made.
