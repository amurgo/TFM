Associates


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Secretary of State appeals with permission against  a  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Swaney promulgated on 17 April 2019. We shall
    refer to the parties as they appeared before the  First-tier  Tribunal.
    On 11 April 2018 the respondent made a decision to refuse the appellant
    his human rights claim and maintain  a  decision  to  deport  him.  The
    appellant appealed against that decision to the  FTT  who  allowed  the
    appeal. The respondent argues that decision cannot stand because  of  a
    material error of law.

Background

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Trinidad and Tobago. He was  born  on  27
    July 1981. He arrived in the United Kingdom on 28 June  1988,  a  month
    short of his 17th birthday,  on  a  six  month  visitor  visa.  He  was
    subsequently granted leave to remain as the child  of  a  spouse  of  a
    British citizen until 17 February 2002.

 3. On 2 August 2002 the appellant was convicted of robbery  and  sentenced
    to 45 months in a Young  Offenders'  Institution.  An  application  for
    indefinite leave to remain was  subsequently  refused.  An  appeal  was
    dismissed. The appellant was arrested on 19 December  2007  and  served
    with a notice of  liability  for  removal  as  an  overstayer.  He  was
    required to report to the Home Office but  failed  to  do  so  and  was
    recorded as an absconder until 1 December 2015.

 4. On 14 July 2010 the  appellant  was  convicted  of  travelling  on  the
    railway without paying a fare and was fined �350.

 5. Attempts were made in 2010 and 2012 to  notify  the  appellant  of  his
    liability for deportation. A decision to deport was made  on  18  April
    2012 but could not be served on the appellant as his  whereabouts  were
    unknown.

 6. On 15 December the appellant made an application for leave to remain on
    the basis of his family and private life.  A  decision  to  deport  was
    served on him on 10 May 2017.  On  15  May  the  appellant's  solicitor
    provided the respondent with evidence in support  of  his  claim  under
    Article 8 ECHR.

The First-tier Tribunal decision

 7. In a careful and well-constructed  decision  FTTJ  Swaney  allowed  the
    appeal on Article 8 grounds holding that  the  circumstances  could  be
    held  to  be  very  compelling  over  and  above  the   exceptions   to
    deportation.

 8. The appellant lives with his sister and her husband and teenage son  in
    Kent. His sister, [D], moved there  approximately  10  years  ago.  The
    appellant has not worked since then but he  helps  his  sister  in  her
    beauty business. After the shop is closed he cleans  it  and  does  the
    stocktaking. He lives rent free and his sister gives him  approximately
    �60 per week. His sister suffers from systemic lupus  which  gives  her
    extreme fatigue and pain. She goes to bed early to try and conserve her
    energy.

 9. The appellant's nephew is 13 years old. His brother in law is a soldier
    in the British Army. He is away during the week and comes home  at  the
    weekend. Because of his sister's  illness  and  his  brother  in  law's
    absence during the week the appellant plays a significant role  in  his
    nephew's life. He takes him to cadets, karate and the cinema and  helps
    him with his homework. His sister told the FTTJ that he does everything
    that her husband would do. She also told the  FTTJ  that  she  believed
    that her son would be devastated if the appellant could not  remain  in
    the UK. He would not be able to  participate  in  activities  as  there
    would be no-one to take him and he would lack a male role model in  the
    absence of her husband.

10. The appellant submitted that there were obstacles to him  returning  to
    Trinidad and Tobago. He had not been there for 20 years. His father had
    passed away and the only family that was left were  distant  aunts  and
    uncles whom he had no contact with.

11. The FTTJ rejected a submission by the respondent that, as a  result  of
    his  conviction,  the  appellant  was  not  socially   and   culturally
    integrated into the United Kingdom. Under reference to  Bossade  [2015]
    UKUT 00415 (IAC) she found that while social and  cultural  integration
    can be broken by criminal  offending  it  can  also  be  regained.  The
    offence was 17 years ago.  The  appellant  had  not  committed  another
    similar offence since then  -  she  did  not  put  any  weight  on  the
    conviction for not paying a rail fare - and the significant  period  of
    time  since  the  index  offence  without   further   adverse   conduct
    demonstrated that he could properly be said to have regained his social
    and cultural integration.

12. Having analysed the evidence in respect of obstacles  to  returning  to
    Trinidad and Tobago the FTTJ found that the appellant would be able  to
    gain an understanding of how life operates there and  begin  developing
    the kind of ties that would give substance to his  private  and  family
    life within a reasonable period of time. She found that  he  would  not
    face very significant obstacles to  his  integration  in  Trinidad  and
    Tobago [72].

13. The appellant enjoyed a private life in the UK. He arrived as  a  minor
    and had been here for more  than  20  years.  The  appellant's  sister,
    because of her health  difficulties,  relied  on  the  appellant  to  a
    significant extent. The FTTJ found that her dependence on the appellant
    for assistance in her business and in caring for her  son  went  beyond
    the normal emotional ties to be expected between adult  siblings  [73].
    The respondent's decision engaged article 8.

14. There was no evidence that the appellant had  ever  been  dependent  on
    public funds and he was likely to be financially independent if allowed
    to remain in the UK. These were neutral factors. The appellant has been
    in the UK unlawfully  since  2004.  Judge  Swaney  found  that  as  his
    presence had been precarious she was required to place little weight on
    the appellant's private life [76].

15. The FTTJ then moved on to  consider  whether  or  not  the  appellant's
    circumstances could be considered very compelling over  and  above  the
    exceptions to deportation such that they outweigh the  public  interest
    in deportation. She applied the dicta of the  Court  of  Appeal  in  NA
    (Pakistan) [2016] EWCA Civ 662 at [30] and had regard to what the Court
    of Appeal said in respect of very compelling circumstances  in  SSHD  v
    Garzon [2018] EWCA Civ 1225.

16. The FTTJ then considers the position of the appellant's nephew. She had
    regard to a witness statement prepared by him. It  was  clear  that  he
    valued the relationship with his uncle, particularly since  his  father
    was away from home during the week. He  relied  on  him  to  a  certain
    extent to help him access social activities. His mother  would  not  be
    able to do this because of her health [83]. The best interests  of  the
    appellant's nephew were met by the  appellant  remaining  part  of  the
    family unit of which the appellant  is  an  important  part  [84].  The
    appellant's deportation would  be  a  significant  loss  to  the  whole
    family. That however was an inevitable result of  deportation  and  was
    not a factor that carried significant weight [85].

17. The FTTJ found  that  the  appellant's  relationship  with  his  sister
    amounted to family life because of  the  mutual  dependencies  on  each
    other. She suffered from systemic lupus  and  carpal  tunnel  syndrome.
    This impacted on her physical ability to work and care for her son. She
    accepted that the appellant played a significant role  in  helping  his
    sister in the business and a significant role in helping her  with  her
    son [87]. The FTTJ considered  whether  there  were  any  other  family
    members who could fulfil this role but concluded that there was no  one
    to fill the gap {88].

18.  The  appellant  had  deliberately  not  maintained  contact  with  the
    respondent and this frustrated the respondent's ability  to  remove  or
    deport him. Although the FTTJ commented that at best the respondent  is
    responsible for the delay between 2004 and 2007 she found that this was
    not a weighty factor [90]. The appellant had  demonstrated  that  there
    was a very low risk that he will re-offend and a very low risk of harm.
    She found that the lapse  of  time  since  the  offending  had  reduced
    somewhat the importance of all of the elements of the  public  interest
    [92].

   1. Judge Swaney finally listed all the factors and concluded at  [93]  as
      follows:

           "I have considered the appellant's conviction and the fact  that
           it must have been relatively serious given the sentences imposed
           for a first offence; the appellant's  poor  immigration  history
           and deliberate evasion of immigration control for  a  number  of
           years; the establishment (and more particularly the development)
           of his private and family  life  while  [his]  status  has  been
           precarious and/or unlawful;  and  the  fact  that  he  does  not
           satisfy either of the exceptions to deportation and have weighed
           them against the best interests of the appellant's  nephew;  his
           family life with his sister [D]; the length of  time  since  his
           conviction and good (save for one  indiscretion)  conduct  since
           then; the fact that it was one offence, which  although  serious
           was not of the most serious in nature; his social  and  cultural
           integration in the United Kingdom; the role he plays within  his
           family and in particular in the upbringing of his nephew. I find
           that on the particular  facts  of  this  case,  the  appellant's
           circumstances can properly be described as very compelling  over
           and above the exceptions to deportation."

Submissions for Respondent

19. The respondent's grounds of appeal  were  supplemented  by  a  skeleton
    argument and  oral  submissions.  The  respondent  submitted  that  the
    finding that the appellant was socially and culturally integrated  into
    the United Kingdom was flawed. The appellant had accepted that he could
    not  satisfy  the  terms  of  section  117C(4)(i)  of  the  Nationality
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and IR  399A(i).  This  acceptance  was
    absent from  the  FTTJ's  consideration  of  his  social  and  cultural
    integration. One of the material aspects of integration was that it  is
    law abiding Binbuga (Turkey) v SSHD [2019] EWCA Civ 551, at  [58].  The
    FTTJ had failed to note that the appellant's residence from 2004 was as
    the status  of  an  overstayer  -  a  criminal  offence  under  section
    24(1)(b)(i) of the Immigration Act 1971. The FTTJ had  also  failed  to
    consider that the appellant was an absconder from 19 December 2007. The
    FTTJ had also given positive weight to the appellant's  private  rights
    on the basis of  his  illegal  working  in  the  UK  (in  his  sister's
    business). This was  a  serious  countervailing  factor  in  favour  of
    removal; ZS (Jamaica) v SSHD [2012] EWCA Civ 1639, at [27].

20. The FTTJ had given weight to  the  fact  that  the  appellant  had  not
    offended since 2003, other than the failure to pay the train  fare.  It
    had also reduced the weight to the public interest on the justification
    that the passage of time since the offence had reduced the strength  of
    the public interest. These two lines of reasoning constituted  material
    mis-directions and were perverse: RA (s117C:  "unduly  harsh:  offence:
    seriousness) Iraq [2019] UKUT 123  (IAC),  endorsed  by  the  Court  of
    Appeal in Binbuga.

21. The FTTJ had effectively rewarded  the  appellant  for  his  persistent
    dishonesty and flagrant disinterest in immigration law in the UK.  Once
    the appellant had lost his appeal against refusal of ILR he should have
    left the UK. It was not accepted that there was any egregious delay  on
    the part of the respondent between 2004 and 2007  and  it  was  in  any
    event irrelevant and inconsistent with authority; R (on the application
    of Shou Lin Xu) v Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  (Legacy
    cases - "conclusion" issue) [2014] UKUT 375 (IAC); Patel v Secretary of
    State for the Home Department [2013] UKSC  72;  RLP  (BAH  revisited  -
    expeditious justice) Jamaica [2017] UKUT 00330 (IAC). The comment  that
    the offence was not the most serious was inconsistent with the approach
    laid out in authority such as NA (Pakistan) v Secretary  of  State  for
    the Home Department [2016] EWCA Civ 662, at [22].

22. The FTTJ had erred in failing to explain how the  relationship  between
    the  appellant  and  his  nephew  could  be  material  to  the  overall
    conclusion of very compelling circumstances. The FTTJ  found  that  the
    care duties could  be  absorbed  by  the  family  as  a  whole  thereby
    militating against the adverse impact on his  sister.  Social  services
    would if required step in BL (Jamaica) v Secretary  of  State  for  the
    Home  Department  [2016]  EWCA  Civ  357,  [53].  Even  a  genuine  and
    subsisting parental relationship was not enough to outweigh the  public
    interest in the very compelling circumstance test; see e.g. WZ  (China)
    v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2017] EWCA  Civ  795,  at
    [14].

23.  In  oral  submissions  Mr  Melvin  submitted  that  the  decision  was
    irrational and in effect  rewarded  the  appellant  for  having  evaded
    immigration control for a very substantial period of time.





Submissions for Appellant

24. The appellant was culturally and socially integrated into the  UK.  The
    mere fact that he had a serious conviction was not a barrier to holding
    that social and cultural integration: Bossade [2015] UKUT 00415  (IAC),
    at [25]. Length of residence, lawful  or  otherwise  is  plainly  taken
    account of as indicative of, rather  than  irrelevant  to,  social  and
    cultural integration as is an individual's ability  to  speak  English,
    having family ties here, financial independence and  moving  away  from
    criminal conduct. The FTTJ had considered Bossade and the  decision  of
    the Court of  Appeal  in  Binbuga,  which  endorsed  the  reasoning  in
    Bossade.

25. The suggestion that the FTTJ had failed to take into account  the  fact
    that the appellant had been  working  illegally  was  an  entirely  new
    ground not focussed in the grounds of appeal. In  any  event  the  FTTJ
    clearly comprehended that the appellant was an overstayer and with  his
    history of evading the authorities.

26. The respondent submitted that the FTTJ had failed to give clear reasons
    as to how the appellant  had  met  the  threshold  of  very  compelling
    circumstances. None  of  these  points  suggested  that  the  FTTJ  had
    misdirected itself in law. Ultimately that was a rationality  challenge
    and a disagreement with the outcome. The situation was similar to  that
    in Secretary of State for the Home Department v Garzon [2018] EWCA  Civ
    1225. In that case the Court of Appeal acknowledged that  the  tribunal
    had addressed its mind to the great weight that must  be  afforded  the
    public interest and the high threshold to  be  implied  in  the  phrase
    "very compelling circumstances". The court  noted  that  while  another
    specialist tribunal might have reached a different conclusion it  could
    not be said that the decision was perverse, paragraphs [28]  and  [30].
    (See also Secretary of State for the Home  Department  v  JG  (Jamaica)
    [2019] EWCA Civ 982, paragraphs [30] - [34]).

27. In oral submissions Mr Muquit responded to the criticism that the  FTTJ
    was rewarding the appellant for evading immigration control. He pointed
    to paragraphs [89] and [90] of the FTTJ's decision. He noted  that  the
    FTTJ found that  the  appellant's  actions  in  failing  to  report  as
    required  or  to  notify  the  respondent  as  to  his  whereabout  was
    responsible for frustrating  the  respondent's  ability  to  remove  or
    deport him  at  an  earlier  stage.  Accordingly  the  FTTJ  had  fully
    considered the issue and had weighed it in the balance with  the  other
    factors.

Decision

28. It is worth reminding ourselves of the function of the UT, particularly
    in the light of the recent Court of Appeal authority; UT v Secretary of
    State for the Home Department [2019]  EWCA  Civ  1095.  Describing  the
    function of the UT Floyd LJ said;

           "If the UT finds an error of law,  the  UT  may  set  aside  the
           decision of the FTT and remake the decision: section  12(1)  and
           (2) of the 2007 Act. If there is no error of law  in  the  FTT's
           decision, the decision will stand. Secondly, although "error  of
           law" is widely defined, it is  not  the  case  that  the  UT  is
           entitled to remake the decision of the  FTT  simply  because  it
           does not agree with it, or because it thinks it  can  produce  a
           better one. Thus, the reasons given for considering there to  be
           an error of law really matter. Baroness Hale put it in this  way
           in AH (Sudan) v Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  at
           [30]:  "Appellate  courts  should  not   rush   to   find   such
           misdirections simply because they might have reached a different
           conclusion on the facts or expressed themselves differently."

29. Although we do not consider that the FTTJ has  been  in  error  in  the
    manner in which she set out her reasoning it is  also  worth  reminding
    ourselves of the dicta of Lord Hope in R (Jones) v First Tier  Tribunal
    and Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority [2013] UKSC 19, quoted  in
    UT at [26]

           "It is well established,  as  an  aspect  of  tribunal  law  and
           practice, that judicial restraint should be exercised  when  the
           reasons that  a  tribunal  gives  for  its  decision  are  being
           examined. The appellate court should not assume too readily that
           the tribunal misdirected itself just because not every  step  in
           its reasoning is fully set out in it."

30. Similar dicta can be found in Garzon, a case  to  which  the  FTTJ  had
    regard in respect of the  approach  to  very  compelling  circumstances
    [79].

31. The FTTJ starts her consideration noting that  deportation  is  in  the
    public interest [59]. She notes that the appellant does not satisfy the
    immigration  rules  and  accordingly  in  order  to  succeed  he   must
    demonstrate that his circumstances are very compelling over  and  above
    the exceptions to deportation [63]. She correctly adopts  the  approach
    desiderated by the Court of Appeal in NA (Pakistan) v SSHD [2016]  EWCA
    Civ 662 at [37].

32. The FTTJ was entitled to reject the submission from the respondent that
    the appellant is not culturally and socially integrated into the UK. In
    Bossade the UT stated in terms that "merely being  a  foreign  criminal
    cannot preclude a person from showing the necessary integration"  [25].
    The reasons for her conclusion are set out in paragraphs [64] to  [67].
    The facts in both Bossade and perhaps  more  particularly  Binbuga  are
    significantly different to those that  pertain  here.  In  Binbuga  the
    appellant was a member of a gang and the evidence pointed  to  no  real
    disengagement in criminal activity. In this case, apart from the  minor
    matter of failing to pay a rail fare, the appellant has not engaged  in
    any other criminal activity. In particular  there  is  no  evidence  to
    suggest that he is a member of a gang or associates with criminals.

33. At [92] the FTTJ states that  the  offence  can  now  be  described  as
    historic and continues "I consider  that  the  lapse  of  time  reduces
    somewhat the importance of all of the elements of public interest. i.e.
    public protection, deterrence and public confidence/social  revulsion".
    There is of course a strong  public  interest  in  the  maintenance  of
    strong immigration controls. If by that statement the FTTJ is taken  to
    imply that she considers that the maintenance of immigration control is
    not a public interest then we consider that she is in error. However we
    consider that read in context she is dealing with the  public  interest
    arsing out of the historic offending and not an overall  assessment  of
    the  public  interest.  She  deals  separately  with  the  question  of
    immigration control and we deal with that below.

34. We are not persuaded that the FTTJ was wrong to suggest that the public
    interest was lessened by the passage of time. It cannot  be  said  that
    there is a substantial public interest in removing a criminal from  the
    UK on the grounds of public protection when  the  offence  occurred  17
    years before, the appellant has served his sentence and to all  intents
    and purposes  has  not  re-offended.  While  there  may  be  issues  of
    deterrence and public confidence we consider  that  the  weight  to  be
    attributed to these elements is also weakened by the  passage  of  time
    and the lack of offending since then. Indeed it might  be  argued  that
    public confidence in the criminal justice  system  is  strengthened  by
    seeing that someone who had received a substantial prison sentence  was
    able to stay away from criminal activity on release.

35. By far the most serious criticism that is made of the  FTTJ's  decision
    is  that  it  rewards  the  appellant  for  having  effectively  evaded
    immigration control. We take the view that no substantial criticism can
    be made of  the  respondent's  actions  in  attempting  to  remove  the
    appellant from the UK. In Patel  [27]  Lord  Carnwath  JSC  giving  the
    judgement of the Supreme Court said that there was no obligation on the
    Secretary of State to make removal directions in any  case.  They  were
    simply part of the armoury available to  her  for  the  enforcement  of
    immigration control. In Shou Lin Xu the UT held that the  Secretary  of
    State is entitled to proceed on the basis that those unlawfully in  the
    UK will leave of their own accord [13].

36. There is a public interest in the maintenance of  immigration  control:
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002,  s.117B(1).  We  consider
    that this is a strong public interest and the great  weight  should  be
    given to need to enforce and maintain effective  immigration  controls.
    It will in  our  view  seldom  be  the  case  that  a  person  who  has
    effectively evaded immigration control will get  the  benefit  of  that
    evasion. To do  so  would  be  to  reward  the  illegal  immigrant  and
    undermine confidence in the maintenance of immigration controls.

37. Nevertheless it cannot be said that the FTTJ was  not  seized  of  this
    issue. At [90] she records  that  the  appellant  agreed  that  he  had
    deliberately failed to maintain contact with the Home Office. She found
    that the appellant's actions in failing to report  as  required  or  to
    notify the respondent of his whereabouts  frustrated  the  respondent's
    ability to remove or deport him. In [93] she weighs in the balance  the
    appellant's  poor  immigration  history  and  deliberate   evasion   of
    immigration control.

38. In Hesham Ali v Secretary of State for the Home Office [2016] UKSC  60,
    Lord Reed noted that great weight should  generally  be  given  to  the
    public interest in the deportation of offenders [38].  He continued,

        "but that it can be outweighed, applying a proportionality test, by
        very compelling circumstances: in other words,  by  a  very  strong
        claim indeed, as Laws LJ put it in the SS (Nigeria) case  [2014]  1
        WLR 998. The countervailing considerations must be very  compelling
        in order to outweigh the general public interest in the deportation
        of such offenders, as assessed by Parliament and the  Secretary  of
        State. The Strasbourg jurisprudence indicates relevant  factors  to
        consider, and paragraphs 399 and 399A provide an indication of  the
        sorts of matters which the  Secretary  of  State  regards  as  very
        compelling. As explained  at  para.  26  above,  they  can  include
        factors bearing on  the  weight  of  the  public  interest  in  the
        deportation of the particular offender, such as his  conduct  since
        the offence was committed, as  well  as  factors  relating  to  his
        private or family life" (our emphasis)

39.  The  FTTJ  was  engaged  in  a  proportionality  assessment   of   the
    respondent's decision. In our opinion she had  regard  to  all  of  the
    factors that are required to be  made  in  the  carrying  out  of  that
    exercise and followed the relevant authorities. She noted at [94]  that
    this was a finely balanced case. We have no doubt that  is  correct;  a
    differently constituted FTT might have reached a different  conclusion.
    But we cannot say that there was a material error of law in the  FTTJ's
    reasoning.
