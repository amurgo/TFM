                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mrs A Holmes, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Appeared in person


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is an appeal brought by the  Secretary  of  State  against  the
       decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  allowing  the  appeal  of  the
       Respondent, hereinafter "the Claimant" against the decision  of  the
       Secretary of State refusing him a residence card.

    2. The Secretary of State appeals because the Tribunal has ruled in the
       case of Sala (EFMs: Right of Appeal) [2016] UKUT 00411  (IAC)  that,
       contrary to what people have thought for a long time,  there  is  no
       right of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal against the  decision  of
       the Secretary of State not to grant a residence  card  to  a  person
       claiming as an extended family member.

    3. The decision is  Sala  is  reported  and  I  intend  to  follow  it.
       Consequently I have to set aside  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
       Tribunal and substitute a decision that there is no jurisdiction  to
       entertain an appeal.

    4. I put on record that Ms Holmes, for  the  Secretary  of  State,  has
       confirmed that there was no challenge  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal
       Judge's findings of fact and the Secretary of State will  reconsider
       the matter in the light of those findings but for  the  purposes  of
       the record I rule that the First-tier Tribunal erred in  law  and  I
       substitute a decision that there is no right of appeal  against  the
       decision complained of.

Notice of Decision

The Secretary of State's appeal is allowed.
