                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appellants' appeal against the decision  of  Judge  Shimmin
    made following a consideration of the papers at Bradford  on  14th  May
    2014.





Background

 2. The first appellant was granted leave to enter  the  UK  as  a  Tier  4
    (General) Student on 19th May 2011 until 25th September 2013.  She  was
    granted further leave on 17th August 2012 until 7th October 2013.

 3. She subsequently made a combined application for leave to remain in the
    UK as a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant under the points-based  system
    and for a biometric  residence  permit.   The  respondent  refused  the
    application on the grounds that she did not have adequate  maintenance.
    She was required to show that she was in possession of  �11,250  for  a
    consecutive 28 day period as required by paragraph 1A of Appendix C  of
    the Immigration Rules but her bank statements showed that she  and  her
    dependant had only �2,923.08.

 4. The Secretary of State recognised that the appellant claimed  that  she
    only had to show a lower amount of money for her maintenance  funds  as
    she had an "established presence studying in the UK" as  defined  under
    paragraph 14 of Appendix C of the Rules.  However, Appendix C  required
    that an applicant had current entry clearance, leave to enter or  leave
    to remain as a Tier 4 Migrant as at the date of application.

 5. In the appellant's case her leave ran to 7th October  2013.   She  had,
    according to the Secretary  of  State,  made  her  application  on  8th
    October 2013 and therefore no longer had valid leave to remain  in  the
    UK and did not have an established  presence.   Moreover,  she  had  no
    right of appeal against the decision because she did not have leave  to
    remain at the time of the application.

The Judge's Determination

 6. The judge set out the background to the appeal and noted that the  duty
    judge had made the following direction:

         "It is argued by the respondent that the appellant does not have  a
         right of appeal under Section 82 of  the  Nationality,  Immigration
         and Asylum Act 2002 because he/she  did  not  apply  for  leave  to
         remain until the expiry of his/her existing leave.  This is because
         a prior application made during the currency of that leave was  not
         accompanied by the correct fee.  Following the decision  in  Basnet
         (validity of application - respondent) [2012] UKUT 00113 (IAC)  the
         onus of proof is on the respondent to show that the correct fee was
         not paid.  It is therefore directed that the appeal be listed for a
         substantive hearing; that at that substantive hearing the issue  of
         validity be decided; and that at least fourteen days prior  to  the
         substantive hearing the respondent  lodge  with  the  Tribunal  and
         serve upon the appellant any information showing that  the  correct
         fee was not paid."

 7. The judge noted that there was no  documentation  from  the  respondent
    showing that the correct fee  was  not  paid  and  furthermore  in  the
    grounds of appeal the  appellant  argued  that  the  applications  were
    lodged online before the expiry of the existing leave.

 8. He then wrote as follows:

         "In the absence of evidence to the contrary I am satisfied that the
         applications were lodged before the expiry of  the  existing  leave
         and that the appeals are valid."

 9. The judge said that the grounds of appeal were generic and there was no
    evidence before him upon which the decisions of the respondent could be
    overturned.  On that basis he dismissed the appeal.

The Grounds of Application

10. The appellant sought permission to appeal on the grounds that the judge
    had not acted fairly and relied upon the case of Patel  (revocation  of
    sponsor licence - fairness) [2011] UKUT 211. She argued  that,  as  the
    judge had found that she had made an in  time  application,  he  should
    have found that she had sufficient maintenance in her account which met
    the requirements of Appendix C since she had an established presence in
    the UK.

11. Permission to appeal was initially refused by Designated Judge  Garratt
    but subsequently granted by Judge King on 21st August 2014.  Judge King
    noted that there was an email from UKBA dated 3rd  October  2013  which
    seemed to indicate that the application was completed  online  by  that
    date.

The Hearing

12. There is no cross-appeal by the respondent challenging the decision  of
    the judge that the applications were lodged before the  expiry  of  the
    existing leave. At the hearing Mr Diwncyz  frankly  accepted  that  the
    Secretary of State was wrong and produced evidence on the  Home  Office
    file that payment had been charged on 3rd October 2013.

13. The judge ought to have engaged with the consequence of that  decision,
    namely whether the appellant should have  been  treated  as  having  an
    established presence in the UK and therefore  subject  to  the  reduced
    maintenance requirements.

14. Both parties agreed that the judge had erred in law and that the appeal
    ought to be allowed to  the  extent  that  the  respondent  should  now
    reconsider the application on the basis that it had been made in time.

Notice of Decision

The original judge erred in law.  His decision is set aside  and  remade  as
follows.  The appeal is allowed and remitted to the Secretary of  State  for
her to make a decision on the application made.

No anonymity direction is made.
