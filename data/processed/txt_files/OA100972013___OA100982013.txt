                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS
                             EXTEMPORE JUDGMENT


 1. The first Appellant appeals with permission a  decision  of  the  First
    tier Tribunal promulgated on 14 March  2014,  in  which  Judge  Wiseman
    dismissed his appeal, brought on Article 8 grounds, against  a  refusal
    of entry clearance as a spouse. Linked to his case is that of his minor
    daughter. Judge Wiseman allowed her appeal on Article 8 grounds on  the
    basis that her best interest determined that  she  should  be  able  to
    reside  with  her  sponsoring  mother.  The  Respondent  appeals   with
    permission that decision.  For ease of reference I refer to the parties
    as they were known at the First Tier. The representatives each  adopted
    the grounds of their  respective  applications,  Mr  Mills  having  re-
    iterated the points therein in the form of a skeleton argument.

 2. I find  in  each  appeal  that  there  no  material  error  of  law  is
    established. I will deal with the position of the  minor  child  first,
    bearing in mind her minority so that the decision  in  respect  of  her
    case impacts on that of the First Appellant, her father.

 3. The Respondent's grounds complain, it having  been  conceded  that  her
    application could not succeed under the  Immigration  Rules,  that  the
    judge had failed to identify compelling circumstances in her  situation
    justifying a decision allowing her appeal on Article 8 grounds  outside
    of the Immigration Rules, or as alternatively expressed under the wider
    jurisdiction of Article 8 ECHR.

 4. The judge found that the sponsoring mother who gave evidence before him
    was in all salient matters credible, and accepted her  entire  account,
    so that the background that led to her giving birth to  this  child  in
    Albania rather than in the UK where  she  had  and  continues  to  have
    permanent settlement is rehearsed in  the  decision  and  is  not  been
    contested in these grounds.

 5. The judge took  into  account  the  best  interests  arsing  from  this
    Appellant's relationship  with  her  half-sibling,  a  British  citizen
    almost 14 years of age, and resident in the United  Kingdom,  and  who,
    the judge found, could  not  reasonably  be  expected  to  relocate  to
    Albania. In considering the Section 55 obligations in respect  of  that
    child the judge has remarked  on  the  closeness  of  the  relationship
    between him and the Second Appellant, and it is  quite  clear,  reading
    the decision as a whole, that the judge found that it was in  the  best
    interests of both of these children that they should be united, able to
    live as a family with their mother in the UK when she is  here  and  in
    Albania when she is there.

 6. The judge noted the very difficult position of the mother having  a  14
    year old British child in education here in the United Kingdom, and her
    partner in Albania. The mother's need to visit Albania is self evident,
    and reflected  by the  Respondent's assertion that she can maintain her
    relationship with her partner by such visits, her need  to  spend  time
    here follows from the need to maintain the family relationship  between
    her and her 14 year old son here

 7. The problems  the immigration status of the Albanian  infant  Appellant
    caused for the mother and for Albanian infant  Appelalnt  herself,   as
    the mother necessarily travels  backwards and forwards  to  Albania  in
    order to maintain those family relationships, are self evident  and  do
    not require detailed analysis.  It is in that overall context that  the
    final conclusion in respect of proportionality so  far  as  this  minor
    Appellant is concerned, must be viewed.

 8. Whilst the judge did not state in great detail all of the circumstances
    surrounding the minor  Appellant,  the  compelling  circumstances  that
    arise in this case can be succinctly expressed as being the age of this
    Appellant.  In the decision the judge notes the Second Appellant's date
    of birth in June 2011. Rather than the Judge's reasons being  deficient
    for a lack of analysis as the grounds assert  it  is  the  respondent's
    grounds that fail to realise that that means that when this application
    was made in January 2013 the she was just over 18 months  old,  and  by
    the date of decision of 11th April 2013 she was not quite 2 years  old.
    By dint of her age her  reliance  or  dependence  upon  her  mother  is
    extremely significant. I am satisfied that the fact of her age is quite
    clearly a compelling circumstance.

 9. In short I am satisfied that in the context of the facts of  this  case
    the judge's consideration  of  her  circumstances  including  her  age,
    relationship  with  her  mother,  relationship  with  her  sibling  and
    relationship between  her  sibling  and  her  mother,  meant  that  the
    determination allowing her appeal against the   refusal  of  her  entry
    clearance is sustainable and far from being even arguably perverse  are
    unassailable.  The judge has done enough to explain why  he  found  the
    second  Appellant's  circumstances  to  be  compelling  and  why  those
    circumstances made the decision disproportionate. The  grounds  of  the
    application, and as argued before me today, reveal no material error.

10. Turning to the appeal of the First Appellant, an adult  Albanian  male,
    the father of the first Appellant and bearing in mind the  position  in
    respect of the Second Appellant, I  have  considered  the  grounds  and
    submissions made by Counsel, Mr Mills, and I shall deal with  them  for
    convenience in the order in which they are set out in the grounds.

11. The first point challenges the judge on the basis  of  his  failure  to
    consider the jurisprudence  of  Boultif,  ï¿½ner,   Sanade,  and  similar
    cases, concerning expulsion and the various dicta  therein  as  to  the
    consideration of Article 8 and the balancing exercise.  Firstly,  I  am
    satisfied that the judge failing to refer to expulsion cases is  not  a
    material error.  Mr Mills argues that the relevance of jurisprudence is
    not determined by whether they are expulsion or out of  country  cases.
    That is to ignore that the cases themselves very  clearly  talks  about
    the difference between out of  country  and  in  country  applications.
    Paragraph 48 in Boultif for example  sets  out  particularly  that  the
    issues concerned are in connection with expulsion cases, and Sanade  at
    paragraph 55, to which I was referred, also again expressly  refers  to
    the fact of the exposition relating to an in-country position.

12. Mr Mills argues that the context of this case is that the decision  has
    led to the splitting up  of  the  family.  I  find  that  misconceived,
    because the splitting up of the family does not arise in the context of
    an out of country cases.  The family is living apart. The  decision  of
    course is the Appellants and the  Sponsor's  in  terms  of  where  they
    decide they wish to found their family  life,  but  it  is  subject  to
    domestic law. This family life as between the First Appellant  and  his
    partner has been enjoyed in the context  of  a  relationship  conducted
    between two countries.  I have not been taken to anything in  terms  of
    the  expulsion  cases  in  any  event  which  could  be  shown  to   be
    determinative so as to give rise to a material error  of  law  in  this
    decision.  I invited Mr Mills to clarify the error of approach that  he
    sought to draw fomr the jurisprudence and he told  me  that  the  cases
    showed that the judge's approach to the criminal convictions was flawed
    for failure to take account of the period of time that has passed since
    his criminal activity.  That I find is not something which assists  him
    because in this case  the  judge  is  quite  clear  that  the  criminal
    activity referred to took place in 2009, and there is just no basis for
    inferring that the judge was not aware of the  passage  of  time  since
    then. Further Mr Mills asserts  that  the  judge  should  have  counted
    positively in the balance the absence of criminal  convictions  in  the
    intervening period.

13.  The difficulty  with  that  submission  is  that  the  judge  was  not
    addressed specifically on the issue of conduct since the commission  of
    the  criminal  offence.   There  was  no  evidence  as  to  the   First
    Appellant's conduct since that time. In any event  the  judgement  does
    not reveal any adverse inference as to the  First  Appellant's  conduct
    during that time apart from, of course, the  apparent  overstay/illegal
    entry when the Appellant came to the  United  Kingdom  and  spent  some
    fifteen months living here illegally, following which the  judge  notes
    that he left the country in order to go to see his family.  There is no
    evidence, for example, that he left as a result of trying to regularise
    his position. So there is nothing in the judgment  which  would  go  to
    show that the judge took into account matters that he should  not  have
    taken into account or has drawn  any  unsustainable  adverse  inference
    from evidence, or even the absence of evidence.  It was up to the First
    Appellant of course to put forward his case and if  he  wanted  to  put
    forward evidence of his own rehabilitation or  usefulness  in  society,
    then he had the opportunity to do that.  The  judge  had  to  make  the
    decision on the basis of the evidence that was before him.  So  in  the
    round I find no error in the judge's approach to the First  Appellant's
    conviction.

14. In connection with the judge's approach to the best  interests  of  the
    children, Mr Mills prayed in aid the finding that the British child  of
    the Sponsor was in the United  Kingdom  and  could  not  reasonably  be
    expected to relocate to Albania.  Reading the decision in the  round  I
    find, although not perhaps as clearly expressed as it  could  be,  that
    that is the obvious inference that the  judge  has  drawn.   The  judge
    reminds himself that even if the parents can decide where the  children
    in the family should live the child cannot reasonably  be  expected  to
    relocate to Albania.  However contrary to the grounds  I  am  satisfied
    that the judge did not assess the best interests of John in the context
    of the poor  immigration  history  or  the  criminality  of  the  First
    Appellant.  It is quite clear that the judge considered the position of
    John prior to the position of the First Appellant and  the  conclusions
    in respect of John  are  not  predicated  on  the  findings  about  the
    criminality or status of the first Appellant.

15. Turning to the question of the error regarding finances,  I  find  that
    the grounds in that regard are without merit.  It is quite  clear  from
    the judge's consideration that the matters which  weighed  against  the
    First Appellant and which were  found  to  be  determinative  were  his
    criminal history and his poor prior immigration status, and that  those
    were found to outweigh the  practical  difficulties  that  arose  as  a
    result of this family having a family life split across two  countries.
    That position is not significantly affected  by  the  judge's  decision
    that the baby should be allowed to  travel  back  and  forth  with  the
    mother.

16. Throughout the judge has reminded himself that this is  an  application
    which falls to be considered outside of the  Rules  because  it  is  an
    application which cannot succeed within the Rules, and in that  context
    the burden is on the Appellants to show that there  are  exceptionally,
    compelling circumstances that result in an unduly harsh position so  as
    to make disproportionate a refusal to grant outside of those Rules.

17.  As Counsel has recognised, it is not enough to show a near miss in the
    context of the requirements of the financial parts of  the  Immigration
    Rules.  The judge was bound to make his  decision  in  respect  of  the
    financial position on the evidence as it was at the date  of  decision,
    and post decision evidence is only relevant to the point that it  could
    be established as being in  existence  prior  or  as  at  the  date  of
    decision.

18. In any event the judge finds that whilst the financial requirements  of
    the Rules have not been met there would  in  fact  be  no  recourse  to
    additional public funds in the  event  that  the  First  Appellant  did
    arrive in the United Kingdom, but then  went  on.  note  that  was  not
    enough, in the circumstances of this case to show that nonetheless  the
    Appellants should be granted entry clearance on Article 8 grounds.  The
    judge concluding at paragraph 80 that  a  combination  of  all  of  the
    factors  renders  his  exclusion  from  the  United  Kingdom   entirely
    proportionate,  so  allowing  for  the  financial  and  family  matters
    referred to in the preceding paragraphs. In reaching that conclusion  I
    am satisfied that the judge has correctly self-directed  and  that  his
    decision is sustainable on the facts.  For all of those reasons I  find
    that there is no material error of law in either of these decisions.
