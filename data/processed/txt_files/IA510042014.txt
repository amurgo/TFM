                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background

 1. On 24th August 2015 Designated Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  Taylor
    gave permission to the appellant to  appeal  against  the  decision  of
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Kirvan  in  which  she  dismissed  the
    appeal against the decision of the respondent to refuse leave to remain
    as a spouse in accordance with  the  terms  of  paragraph  284  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  The appeal was considered on the papers.

 2. In granting permission Designated Judge Taylor noted that  the  grounds
    contended that the transitional arrangements prevailing at the time  of
    the appellant's  application  on  24th  October  2014  meant  that  the
    appellant did not need to meet the English  language  test  certificate
    requirement set out in sub-paragraph  (ix)(a)  of  paragraph  284.   He
    thought this point arguable.

Error on a Point of Law

 3. Mr Aktar confirmed that he relied upon the grounds.   These  point  out
    that the appellant entered the United Kingdom as a student and was then
    granted an extension of stay from 31st October  2012  to  31st  October
    2014 as a spouse.  In support of her application for leave as a  spouse
    she had provided the requisite English language  certificate  at  level
    A1.  On 24th October 2014 she applied for variation  of  her  leave  to
    remain pointing out in her application, as provided for, that  a  fresh
    English language certificate was not required because  it  had  already
    been sent in connection with  her  first,  successful,  application  to
    remain as a spouse.  In support of this contention the grounds refer to
    the unreported decision of the  President  of  the  Upper  Tribunal  in
    Pinder (IA/13236/2013) in which Mr McVeety, who  also  represented  the
    respondent on that occasion, was said to have  properly  conceded  that
    the  applicant  satisfied  the  requirement  for  an  English  language
    certificate set out in sub-paragraph (ix)(a) of paragraph  284  because
    of the certificate submitted  in  relation  to  a  previous  successful
    application.  The grounds  also  make  reference  to  key  transitional
    arrangements covering applicants who had been granted  entry  clearance
    or leave to remain as spouses before the  new  Immigration  Rules  came
    into force before 9th July 2012. These specifically exempted  the  need
    to provide, amongst other things, the English language test certificate
    in a subsequent application.

 4. In further submissions Mr Aktar accepted that the case  of  Pinder  was
    not reported although Mr McVeety agreed that the point raised  in  that
    case was relevant here.  Mr Aktar also produced to me  a  copy  of  the
    appellant's English language  certificate  issued  by  Trinity  College
    London in May 2012 submitted with the earlier application for leave.

 5. Mr McVeety suggested that the reason the appellant's  application  had,
    actually, been refused was because she had submitted a  certificate  in
    mathematics to which reference is  made  in  the  reasons  for  refusal
    letter of 11th December 2014 and this had prompted  the  decision-maker
    to suggest that the  appellant  had  failed  to  provide  the  required
    English language certificate.  However, he conceded that the  principle
    referred to in the unreported case of Pinder  was  right  in  that  the
    appellant's English language certificate of 2012 was  valid  and  so  a
    fresh one was not needed.  Thus, he agreed that, despite  the  response
    of the Home Secretary dated 27th  August  2015,  the  judge  had  erred
    because she had failed to refer to  the  English  language  certificate
    which was  before  her  which  was  adequate,  under  the  transitional
    arrangements, to show that she met  the  English  language  certificate
    requirement of the Immigration Rules and thus should have been  allowed
    an extension to her stay.

 6. In view of the concession made by Mr McVeety I  announced  that  I  was
    satisfied that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal showed an  error
    on a point of law and should be set aside.  It was also agreed that, as
    the only  basis  for  refusal  under  the  Immigration  Rules  was  the
    erroneous requirement for an English language certificate, I  could  go
    on to re-make the decision by allowing the appeal.  This I now do.

Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal shows an error on a  point  of  law.
I set aside the decision and re-make it to allow the appeal  on  immigration
grounds.

Anonymity

Anonymity was not requested before the First-tier Tribunal or before me  and
I do not consider it appropriate in this appeal.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As it appears to me  that  the  appellant's  application  should  have  been
allowed when submitted because of the transitional provisions of  which  the
respondent ought to have been aware, I make a full fees  award  noting  that
the sum paid for the paper consideration of the appeal was ï¿½80.
